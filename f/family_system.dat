25|$|In {{the late}} 1920s and 1930s, {{literary}} journals and societies espousing various artistic theories proliferated.

In the 1930s Ba Jin produced a trilogy that depicted the struggle of modern youth against the ageold dominance of the Confucian <b>family</b> <b>system.</b> Comparison often is made between Jia (Family), one of the novels in the trilogy, and Dream of the Red Chamber.

25|$|The {{number of}} {{sessions}} {{depends on the}} situation, but the average is 5-20 sessions. A family therapist usually meets {{several members of the}} family at the same time. This has the advantage of making differences between the ways family members perceive mutual relations as well as interaction patterns in the session apparent both for the therapist and the family. These patterns frequently mirror habitual interaction patterns at home, even though the therapist is now incorporated into the <b>family</b> <b>system.</b> Therapy interventions usually focus on relationship patterns rather than on analyzing impulses of the unconscious mind or early childhood trauma of individuals as a Freudian therapist would do - although some schools of family therapy, for example psychodynamic and intergenerational, do consider such individual and historical factors (thus embracing both linear and circular causation) and they may use instruments such as the genogram to help to elucidate the patterns of relationship across generations.|$|E

However, Hazari Lal himself died from a stroke in mid-1908, after which the family were looked after by his brother (Shastri's great-uncle) Darbari Lal, who was the head clerk in the opium regulation department at Ghazipur, and later by his son (Ramdulari Devi's cousin) Bindeshwari Prasad, a school teacher in Mughalsarai. Thus, the greatness of the traditional Indian joint <b>family</b> <b>system,</b> and the traditions of family responsibility and kinship, are deeply evident in Shastri's case, where the orphan child of a penniless widow was raised by his distant relatives in a manner which enabled him to become Prime Minister of India.|$|E

25|$|The Leva or Lewa are {{synonymous with}} the Lewa Patil—the suffix Patil is a feudal title. The {{community}} {{does not have an}} oral history of their origin or migration, but they generally accept that they migrated from Gujarat to the Vidharba region via Nimar (now part of Madhya Pradesh). The community is associated with two other communities from Gujarat: the Lewa and the Lewa Patidar. The former are a well known community; the latter are sometimes referred to as their parental group, but the Kunbi Leva Patil of Maharashtra have roots which are long established in the Kunbi community of Maharashtra. The community perceives their distribution to be in 72 villages in the Jalgaon and Buldhana districts. The Lewa Patil are numerically, economically and educationally superior in some of the multi-ethnic villages of the Buldhana and Jalgaon district. Nuclear families are replacing the traditional extended <b>family</b> <b>system</b> due to a changing economy and an increasing number of conflicts over property inheritance. Cremation of the dead is the norm, burial the exception for the very young (up to three to four months old). There is no distinctive attire of the Leva community—they follow local fashion trends. On very rare occasions, older Leva men wear a Gujarati style, boat shaped topi or hat made from black or brown silk. Some of the common Leva surnames are Warade (Deshmukh), Narkhede, Kharche, Supe, Borle, Panchpande and Kolte. Dowry is practiced in the Leva community. The amount is negotiable. The attitude towards formal education is positive though Leva girls drop out of school earlier due to social conditions.|$|E
25|$|The Lonari Kunbis are {{regarded}} as one of the established cultivating communities in Maharashtra. The Lonari are presently located in the eastern part of the Vidharbha region and in the adjoining districts of Madhya Pradesh. The name of the community comes from Lonar lake in the Mehkar-Chikhli taluka of the Buldhana district, where their original occupation was salt-making. They migrated from the Lonar lake region and eventually arrived in present-day Maharashtra. The oral history of the community contains an elaborate story of their migration. According to tradition, the community migrated to Aurgangabad from their original place of origin in the Lucknow district of Uttar Pradesh, then to Buldana and finally to their current locations in the Amravati and Betul districts of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, respectively. In the two tehsils of Multai and Warud in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashra, respectively, the Lonari Kunbi are also known as Deshmukhs and Kumbhares. The Lonari now rely on the gram panchayats under the state government as changes in the sociopolitical landscape have diminished the influence of the traditional caste council. Monogamy and adult marriages are the norm, but marriages among identical surnames (referred to as hargote) is not allowed. According to the Lonari Kunbi community, they do not engage in the practice of dowry The Lonari Kunbis follow the joint <b>family</b> <b>system,</b> but restrictions on land-owning for agriculture under the Land Revenue Act and the improved educational status of newer generations has caused nuclear families to form. A large number of community members depend on revenue from agriculture, either by cultivating their own lands or working as agricultural labour. The Lonari Kunbi community has made much progress since the 1950s, but problem of poverty is still prevalent and economic instability is still a concern to community members.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{aimed to}} explore the phenomenon of serial murder from a systems theory perspective. The {{purpose of the study}} was to develop an understanding of serial murder in a South African context from a <b>family</b> <b>systems</b> approach. Utilizing a <b>family</b> <b>systems</b> theoretical framework and the genogram method, the study, which was qualitative in nature, explored information about the <b>family</b> <b>systems</b> of individuals who committed serial murder via content analysis. The investigation focused mainly on emotional processes, multigenerational and relationship patterns in <b>family</b> <b>systems.</b> Information was gathered from numerous sources and included interviews conducted inter alia with individuals currently incarcerated for serial murder and their family members, and with professionals involved with such individuals; as well as information obtained from clinical observations and archival data. The results of the content analysis demonstrated considerable similarities but also differences in the organization and functioning of the <b>family</b> <b>systems</b> of individuals who committed serial murder. Importantly, the analysis shed novel theoretical light on the role of serial murder within <b>family</b> <b>systems</b> and challenged established dominant theoretical perspectives on serial murder that have emphasized linear, causal and/or individual-focused explanations. The study opened up considerable opportunities for further exploration of the phenomenon from a systemic perspective, specifically with the focus on the meaning of serial murder in relatively smaller (e. g., parent-child or peer relationships) or larger (e. g., political, cultural and societal) systems. It also provided opportunities for alternative vistas from which the phenomenon of serial murder can be viewed in terms of theoretical, definitional, typological, investigative and correctional approaches.

40|$|This study {{proposes that}} <b>family</b> <b>systems</b> therapy can prove useful in {{understanding}} Biblical families and thus {{add to our}} understanding of the Bible. Employing <b>family</b> <b>systems</b> therapy is appropriate because the Biblical narrative contains a comprehensive treatment of the human family. The Bible deals with family overall, many speciﬁc families as in the Jacob cycle, and ends with a vision of the family of God that exists already in the kingdom of heaven. <b>Family</b> <b>systems</b> theory is often useful to the pastor in understanding his/her own family, and the larger extended family of their church congregation. Thus, with new freshness <b>family</b> <b>systems</b> helps us grasp the truth that Biblical families are like the families we know, our own families. Such appreciation can provide useful material for preaching, teaching and pastoral counselling. This study will begin by outlining some basic concepts of <b>family</b> <b>systems</b> therapy in the ﬁrst chapter. It will follow by examining the Old Testament concept of family in Genesis I- 3 and analyse a number of representative families in the Old Testament such as Adam and Eve, Jacob, Moses, Ruth and Naomi, and David’s families. Proceeding to the New Testament there will be a focus especially on issues of fusion, differentiation, and triangulation applying these concepts to Jesus, Paul, Peter and the Prodigal Son. The chapter on the New Testament will close by offering a suggestion about what the eschatological end of the family might be. Finally, this study points out limitations in the use of <b>family</b> <b>systems</b> therapy for Biblical interpretation, outlines possible pastoral applications, and discusses how far we can use Biblical models of family in support of the concept “traditional family values. ...|$|R

His observations started with the local plants of Cambridge where he lived, with the [...] (1860) which later expanded to his , essentially the first British Flora. Although his [...] (1682, 1688, 1704) provided a step towards a world Flora as he included more and more plants from his travels, first on the continent and then beyond. He extended Caesalpino's natural system with a more precise definition of the higher classification levels, deriving many modern families in the process, and asserted that all parts of plants were important in classification. He recognised that variation arises from both internal (genotypic) and external environmental (phenotypic) causes and that only the former was of taxonomic significance. He was also among the first experimental physiologists. The [...] can be regarded as the first botanical synthesis and textbook for modern botany.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} an interrelated set of {{hypotheses about}} {{the links between}} gender relations, <b>family</b> <b>systems</b> and economic development in EurAsia. Firstly, we briefly discuss a number of ideas from the recent literature about the links between gender relations and economic development. Secondly, we suggest a measure of historic gender relations via the classification and measurement of historical <b>family</b> <b>systems,</b> and offer a set of maps of the institutions concerning marriage, inheritance and family formation that determine the degree of agency that women enjoyed at the micro level. Thirdly, we discuss the possible explanation of {{the genesis of the}} EurAsian pattern in <b>family</b> <b>systems</b> and gender relations as a by-product of the spread of agriculture and the process of ancient state formation that followed the Neolithic Revolution 10, 000 years ago. Finally, we link these patterns in <b>family</b> <b>systems</b> and female agency to economic growth after 1500. We empirically demonstrate that high female agency was related to per capita GDP between 1800 and 2000. The ‘reversal of fortune’ that happened within EurAsia between 1000 and 2000, whereby the ancient centers of state formation and urbanization in the Middle East, India and China were overtaken by regions at the margin of the continent (Western Europe, Japan, Korea), can in our view be linked to this spatial pattern in gender relations and <b>family</b> <b>systems</b> found there (and reconstructed here) ...|$|R
