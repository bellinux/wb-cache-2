40|$|BACKGROUND: Illicit {{cigarettes}} comprise {{more than}} 11 % of tobacco consumption and 17 % of consumption in low- and middle-income countries. Illicit cigarettes, {{defined as those}} that evade taxes, lower consumer prices, threaten national tobacco control efforts, and reduce excise tax collection. METHODS: This paper measures the magnitude of illicit cigarette consumption within Indonesia using two methods: the discrepancies between legal cigarette sales and domestic consumption estimated from surveys, and discrepancies between imports recorded by Indonesia and exports recorded by trade partners. Smuggling plays a minor role in the availability of illicit cigarettes because Indonesians predominantly consume kreteks, which are primarily manufactured in Indonesia. RESULTS: Looking at the period from 1995 to 2013, illicit cigarettes first emerged in 2004. When no respondent under-reporting is assumed, <b>illicit</b> <b>consumption</b> makes up 17 % of the domestic market in 2004, 9 % in 2007, 11 % in 2011, and 8 % in 2013. Discrepancies in the trade data indicate that Indonesia was a recipient of smuggled cigarettes for each year between 1995 and 2012. The value of this illicit trade ranges from less than $ 1 million to nearly $ 50 million annually. Singapore, China, and Vietnam together accounted for nearly two-thirds of trade discrepancies over the period. Tax losses due to <b>illicit</b> <b>consumption</b> amount to between Rp 4. 1 and 9. 3 trillion rupiah, 4 % to 13 % of tobacco excise revenue, in 2011 and 2013. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the predominance of kretek consumption in Indonesia and Indonesia's status as the predominant producer of kreteks, illicit domestic production is likely the most important source for illicit cigarettes, and initiatives targeted to combat this illicit production carry {{the promise of the}} greatest potential impact...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Estimates of <b>illicit</b> {{cigarette}} <b>consumption</b> {{are limited}} {{and the data}} obtained from studies funded by the tobacco industry {{have a tendency to}} inflate them. This study aimed to validate an industry-funded estimate of 35. 9 % for Hong Kong using a framework taken from an industry-funded report, but with more transparent data sources. METHODS: <b>Illicit</b> cigarette <b>consumption</b> was estimated as the difference between total cigarette consumption and the sum of legal domestic sales and legal personal imports (duty-free consumption). Reliable data from government reports and scientifically valid routine sources were used to estimate the total cigarette consumption by Hong Kong smokers and legal domestic sales in Hong Kong. Consumption by visitors and legal duty-free consumption by Hong Kong passengers were estimated under three scenarios for the assumptions to examine the uncertainty around the estimate. A two-way sensitivity analysis was conducted using different levels of possible undeclared smoking and under-reporting of self-reported daily <b>consumption.</b> RESULTS: <b>Illicit</b> cigarette <b>consumption</b> was estimated to be about 8. 2 - 15. 4 % of the total cigarette consumption in Hong Kong in 2012 with a midpoint estimate of 11. 9 %, as compared with the industry-funded estimate of 35. 9 % of cigarette consumption. The industry-funded estimate was inflated by 133 - 337 % of the probable true value. Only with significant levels of under-reporting of daily cigarette consumption and undeclared smoking could we approximate the value reported in the industry-funded study. CONCLUSIONS: The industry-funded estimate inflates the likely levels of <b>illicit</b> cigarette <b>consumption.</b> Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an analytical discussion of several interconnected resource allocation problems from under-pricing of electricity used by farmers for groundwater extraction. In these situations, groundwater extraction is inefficiently high even without electricity under-pricing. Moreover, {{part of the}} electric power supply intended for farmers is often diverted to other unauthorized uses (notably <b>illicit</b> <b>consumption).</b> The paper demonstrates that unless non-price electricity rationing imposes severe constraints on demand, the range of resource allocation problems includes insufficient incentives to provide high-level service by the power utility, insufficient incentives for farmers to install and operate efficient equipment, and losses due to political"rent seeking"activities to influence water allocations. It also shows that diversion of electricity to illicit uses can increase overall economic efficiency when this leads to less electricity use by farmers, thus somewhat ameliorating the problem of excessive groundwater extraction {{as well as the}} inefficiencies related to under-pricing of electricity. Systemic reforms for overcoming these problems may face severe political obstacles.

40|$|This study {{develops}} {{a model of}} consumer complicity with counterfeit and pirated movies to better understand what motivates this type of illicit consumer behavior; specifically whether personal values (idealism, relativism), ethical concern, collectivism, hedonic shopping experience, and perceived quality are plausible predictors of this <b>illicit</b> <b>consumption</b> behavior. We selected movies as the product to examine since the industry has {{a high incidence of}} lost sales due to counterfeits in physical markets (e. g., DVDs) and piracy by way of digital formats (e. g., illegal downloading and/or video streaming). Using a web-based survey, over 1, 500 consumers from Brazil, China, India, Russia, and the U. S. support the model and provide a means to identify a complicit consumer across country markets. The consumers’ lack of ethical concern and the favorable hedonic shopping experience in both physical and virtual markets are the strongest predictors of consumer complicity to obtain illicit movies. Implications for managers are to discourage complicity through demarketing campaigns that defray the hedonic shopping stimulus, foster a credible ethical concern, and create a negative association of inferior quality towards the fake movies...|$|E

40|$|Background: Peer {{methodology}} (PM) is {{an adaptation}} of the privileged access interviewer methodology and is used for prevalence studies. PM estimates higher drug consumption frequencies among school and college students than self reports, since it minimizes underreporting. Aim: To assess drug abuse among students using PM. Material and methods: A random sample of 234 school students of middle and low-middle socioeconomic status, aged 9 to 14 years (53 % women) were interviewed using PM about drug consumption. Results: The frequency of licit drug consumption {{during the last year}} was 29 % and 15 % during the last month (current consumption). The consumption of tobacco and alcohol was 20 % and 18 % respectively during the last year. The figures for the last month were 11 % and 8 % respectively. The beginning age for smoking and alcohol consumption were 11. 1 ± 1. 5 and 11. 3 ± 1. 8 years respectively. The frequency of <b>illicit</b> drug <b>consumption</b> was 3. 5 %.

40|$|This study {{explored}} the motivations behind illicit tobacco use in Australia. A key focus {{was to investigate}} the hypothesis that the primary motivation for illicit tobacco use is its low cost in comparison to the price of legal tobacco. Methods: An Australian tobacco usage telephone survey was conducted in 2007. Illicit tobacco smokers completed a longer version of the questionnaire, with questions relating to illicit tobacco usage and perceptions. Findings: Of the current smokers of illicit tobacco surveyed, almost half would consider increasing <b>illicit</b> tobacco <b>consumption</b> if the cost of legal tobacco were to increase to four times the price of illicit tobacco, although others stated consumption would remain the same regardless of such a price change. Almost all former smokers of illicit tobacco claimed that price did not influence the decision to stop smoking illicit tobacco. Conclusions: Some illicit tobacco smokers appear {{to be sensitive to the}} price of tobacco products, but price is not always an underlying motivator. Personal preference and supply also influence <b>illicit</b> tobacco <b>consumption.</b> The findings suggest that reducing the availability of illicit tobacco would be a useful strategy for combating the growing illicit tobacco problem...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The <b>illicit</b> <b>consumption</b> of psychoactive {{compounds}} {{may cause}} {{short and long-term}} health problems and addiction. This is also true for amphetamines and cocaine, which target monoamine transporters. In the recent past, {{an increasing number of}} new compounds with amphetamine-like structure such as mephedrone or 3, 4 -methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) entered the market of illicit drugs. Subtle structural changes circumvent legal restrictions placed on the parent compound. These novel drugs are effectively marketed “designer drugs ” (also called “research chemicals”) without any knowledge of the underlying pharmacology, the potential harm or a registration of the manufacturing process. Accordingly new entrants and their byproducts are identified postmarketing by chemical analysis and their pharmacological properties inferred by comparison to compounds of known structure. However, such a heuristic approach fails, if the structures diverge substantially from a known derivative. In addition, the understanding of structure−activity relations is too rudimentary to predict detailed pharmacological activity. Here, we tested a combined approach by examining the composition of street drugs using mass spectrometry and by assessing the functional activity of their constituents at the neuronal transporters for dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. We show that this approach is superior to mere chemical analysis in recognizing novel and potentially harmful street drugs...|$|E

40|$|Mitragyna speciosa Korth (Kratom), a herb of the Rubiaceae {{family is}} {{indigenous}} to southeast Asia. The plant and its dominant alkaloid mitragynine (MIT) are narcotic/analgesic and <b>illicit</b> <b>consumption</b> is widespread in Asia; the toxicological consequences of consumption are poorly documented. We determined cytotoxicity of MIT on human cell lines and report dose and time-dependent stimulation and inhibition of proliferation. Since MIT has powerful opiate-like activity, we focussed on human neuronal SH-SY 5 Y cell line {{and found the}} colony forming ability of cells treated with MIT showed a dose-dependent trend for reduced survival. Studies using metabolically competent MCL- 5 cells and chemical inhibitors indicated that CYP 2 E 1 and 2 A 6 {{were involved in the}} cytotoxicity. Cytotoxicity was preceded by cell cycle arrest mainly at G 1 and S phase. To assess whether arrest was due to DNA damage or mutation, we examined genotoxic potential using the L 5178 TK +/− mouse lymphoma assay and found that MIT was not genotoxic at the TK locus, even at doses that were highly cytotoxic. To investigate mechanisms of MIT cytotoxicity, we used flow cytometry and annexin V with 7 -amino-actinomycin D staining and show apoptosis and necrotic activity. Apoptosis was further supported as MIT rapidly induced the activity of executioner caspases 3 / 7. However, cytotoxicity of MIT was partially reduced by inclusion of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone, a μ and δ opioid receptor antagonist, suggesting that cytotoxicity depends in part on opioid signalling, consistent with the known toxicity of other opiates. Based on consumption of 20 leaves per day of Mitragyna speciosa, we estimated daily human exposure to MIT to be about 17 mg MIT for regular consumers, potentially giving plasma concentrations in of 10 − 9 to 10 − 7 M. Importantly, fatalities after kratom consumption have been reported to occur in individuals with blood mitragynine concentrations of between 0. 45 – 1. 0 μM, substantially lower than the threshold of toxicity predicted from this in vitro report. Clearly the implications of these findings to humans consuming Mitragyna speciosa leaves will require further study, but individuals taking large quantities of these opiate-like materials may be at risk, especially those who have a high CYP 2 E 1 activity, such as heavy alcohol users...|$|E

40|$|Metadata only entryConsumer {{research}} {{has sought to}} challenge and move away from classical models of behaviour by drawing on alternative traditions from across the social sciences which emphasize the cultural, sociological, anthropological, ideological and historical systems of consumer society and {{the place of the}} individual within them (Arnould and Thompson 2005). Within this broader sociocultural paradigm of the consumer there is a growing space for discussion of issues related to the influence of reference groups, competitive consumption, conformity and upward social mobility via status-seeking consumption phenomena. While attention has given to academics and theorists who have examined the processes of class consumption and social differentiation, such as Pierre Bourdieu (Holt 1998) and Jean Baudrillard, relatively limited detailed attention has been given to Thorstein Veblen’s (1899) The Theory of the Leisure Class, (Hereafter TLC) a foundational and seminal text for these concerns and issues. The TLC is one of the earliest and most complete accounts of the dynamics and structures of early American consumer culture. Although many consumer researchers will be aware of some of the terminology popularised from the book-especially the term “conspicuous consumption”- surprisingly little research by marketing theorists and consumer researchers engages with the substance of Veblen’s arguments and observations (Mason 1998). Our paper invites readers to re-examine and re-imagine Veblen in more complete terms, and will show how a Veblenian inspired analysis can be useful and relevant not only in historical and theoretical terms but as a framework for understanding contemporary consumer culture. To achieve this we provide a Veblenian take on the autobiographical and confessional book, The Wolf of Wall Street (2008). In TLC Veblen explicated how the use of possessions as means of indicating one’s success and prosperity has occurred for centuries and drawing insights from the barbaric stage of human development he described the use and exhibition of trophies, together with women and slaves, as means of fulfilling men’s craving for status. Focusing his analysis on modern industrial and developed societies, Veblen suggested that social status was signified through the possession, accumulation and exhibition of luxurious goods and status symbols which indicated one’s membership in an upper social class. Veblen emphasized that individuals’ motivation to emulate the consumption preferences and cultural practices of the class above played a fundamental role in the formation of social networks, class distinctions and social mobility via wasteful consumption. The primary association of Veblen’s name with the term conspicuous consumption, as a construct referring to the ostentatious economic display of the late 19 th century, offers a simplistic and cursory representation of Veblen’s theory by treating his work as an historical account with limited relevance to consumer research of the 21 st century. Veblen’s book includes some diachronic insights on consumer culture and relevant ideas to contemporary studies in consumption. We conclude that consumer research can benefit from a more thorough understanding of The Theory of the Leisure Class, based on a closer and more in-depth examination of Veblen’s arguments related to excess, generation of irrational desires, status competition, <b>illicit</b> <b>consumption</b> and abstention from productive forces as means of signifying higher social standing...|$|E
40|$|There {{is nothing}} trivial about <b>illicit</b> <b>consumption</b> in {{contemporary}} societies. While cultural capital {{can play a}} significant role in structuring social mobility, the desire to acquire goods, whether legitimately or illegitimately, has a direct and obvious link to a widespread business crime of Theft from Stores (TFS). Thus far, over time, and throughout society, TFS has flourished in our consumer-focused society, and while it has been on the increase in recent years, it has received relatively limited attention in the research literature. Evidence mainly showed that TFS is extremely widespread, and is not just restricted to the store from which "goods" are stolen or where criminal loss is caused， and it often affects society as a whole. This commonly committed crime has seldom been researched from the viewpoint of victims, and the means of considering the publics reactions and attitudes towards such phenomenon was of importance in this study. Previous research has argued that causal societal response might pinpoint an alternative way of tackling criminality and thus develop better effective strategies to confront and reduce TFS. Using attributions to understand the effects of causal explanations on respondent’s reactions was this study's methodological standpoint. This study ground its discussion on the structural reaction of the causal explanatory nature through the eyes of the victimized "key stakeholders" perceptions, by linking attitude research and TFS research. Thus, the purpose of this study was to develop more insights into how lay attitude toward the potential causes of TFS in general concur with, or differ from research accounts. Another important aspect of this study was to simplify the data and construct those reactions into specific domains that influence the formation of their attitudes toward the causes. Attitudes were measured by an attributional style design. The results of the study indicate the following: (1) lay attitudes varied between different backgrounds, and (2) a structural pattern underlying the formation of those attitudes towards the causes of TFS. Overall, the results captured belief values of seven specific goal-directed strategic domains that had found support on evolutionary reasoning and understanding. The identification of those seven factors formed the structural framework of the lay attributes that reflect to domain-specific social psychological mechanisms, which have evolved to deal with the unique complexities of contemporary demands, and thus are selected for very specific goals and their attendant strategies. This study argues that the origins why some people might want to commit an offence of so-called "shoplifting" or "consumer theft", and serves an evolutionary psychology (EP) purpose, since results suggest that there are very clear ancient behaviours still at work here in our current consumer-obsessed environment. Overall, it makes sense in our consumer-obsessed cultures that so many people steal, since results reveal that such reasoning can take information a step further. More than just a means of acquisition, TFS allows people to immediately experience of other symbolic values through strategic solutions likely to be successful for human survival. Where resources are scarce, accruing "goods" illicitly form stores can help both males and females ensure they have the means they need to successfully pass on their genes to the next generation. This study followed the beliefs and desires created in "us" by"our" psychological mechanisms to explain those numerous conditional and circumstantial sought causes that compel people to accumulate resources by stealing. This study provides theoretical and practical contributions, given that TFS has not been surveyed before in such an exploratory research style. The discovery of the underlying goal-directed strategic effort that arouse from this study's factorial structure, will constitute central implications for further TFS research, and may also facilitate methodological advances.

40|$|Background While {{a number}} of {{pharmacological}} interventions exist {{for the treatment of}} opioid use disorder, evidence evaluating the effect of pain on substance use behavior, attrition rate, and physical or mental health among these therapies has not been well established. We aim to evaluate these effects using evidence gathered from a systematic review of studies evaluating chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) in patients with opioid use disorder. Methods We searched the Medline, EMBASE, PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, ProQuest Dissertations and theses Database, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal, and National Institutes for Health Clinical Trials Registry databases to identify articles evaluating the impact of pain on addiction treatment outcomes for patients maintained on opioid agonist therapy. Results Upon screening 3, 540 articles, 14 studies with a combined sample of 3, 128 patients fulfilled the review inclusion criteria. Results from the meta-analysis suggest that pain has no effect on <b>illicit</b> opioid <b>consumption</b> [pooled odds ratio (pOR) : 0. 70, 95 %CI 0. 41 – 1. 17; I 2 = 0. 0] but a protective effect for reducing illicit non-opioid substance use (pOR: 0. 57, 95 %CI 0. 41 – 0. 79; I 2 = 0. 0). Studies evaluating <b>illicit</b> opioid <b>consumption</b> using other measures demonstrate pain to increase the risk for opioid abuse. Pain is significantly associated with the presence of psychiatric disorders (pOR: 2. 18; 95 %CI 1. 6, 2. 9; I 2 = 0. 0 %).

40|$|To {{estimate}} {{the prevalence of}} alcohol, tobacco and <b>illicit</b> drug <b>consumption</b> (through the self-report) in adult Latin-American immigrants of Seville, a cross-sectional descriptive study {{was carried out in}} a representative sample of 190 immigrants. The results showed that 61. 4 % of the participants had consumed alcohol in previous month before data collection, although 13. 2 % of them were at risk of alcoholism. Moreover, 30. 0 % were smokers. In addition, 5. 3 % of the interviewed people had consumed illicit psychoactive substances in the previous six months (Marihuana: 3. 7 %, hashish: 1. 1 % and cocaine: 0. 5 %). For all substances under analysis, the consumption prevalence was much higher in men from 25 to 39 years of age. In conclusion, prevalence levels of this consumption were high among the studied immigrants. Nurses could train the population in the prevention of these risk behaviors through preventive practices...|$|R
40|$|WORKING PAPER No. 10 / 2009 In March 2009, Business and Economic Research Limited ("BERL") {{published}} “Costs of Harmful Alcohol and Other Drug Use,” {{a report}} jointly {{commissioned by the}} Ministry of Health and ACC. BERL was asked to measure the costs of {{drug and alcohol abuse}} to New Zealand society, but not to evaluate specific interventions. BERL calculated annual social costs of alcohol and <b>illicit</b> drug <b>consumption</b> of $ 6. 8 billion, including $ 4. 8 billion in social costs from alcohol alone. The report was cited by Law Commission President Sir Geoffrey Palmer as evidence in support of greater regulation, gaining considerable media coverage. We find substantial flaws in BERL’s method that together account for well over 90 % of BERL’s calculated costs of alcohol use. Corrected external costs of alcohol use amount to $ 662 million and are roughly matched by the $ 516 million collected in alcohol excise taxes. The BERL report is wholly inadequate for use in assisting policy development...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} current state of {{knowledge}} on illicit drugs as emerging environmental contaminants. Several studies have recently reported that illicit drugs are detectable in wastewater from municipal sewage treatment plants (STPs) and surface waters. These substances are excreted in urine and faeces unchanged or as active metabolites in high percentages after consumption and continuously discharged into domestic wastewaters. Residues of illicit drugs can therefore reach STPs in substantial amounts, escaping degradation, and are then released into surface waters. Environmental concentrations are low, but risks for {{human health and the environment}} cannot be excluded. Morphine, cocaine, methamphetamine and ecstasy all have potent pharmacological activities, and their presence as complex mixtures in surface waters may be toxic to aquatic organisms. Levels of residues in untreated wastewater have been used to estimate <b>illicit</b> drug <b>consumption</b> in the population. Given that current epidemiological methods are indirect and possibly biased, this evidence-based approach offers a new tool for estimating drug abuse in real time...|$|R
5000|$|No U.S. {{state has}} enacted a law which criminalizes {{specific}} behavior during pregnancy, but, nonetheless, {{it has been}} estimated that at least 200 American women have been criminally prosecuted or arrested under existing child abuse statutes for allegedly bringing about harm in-utero through their conduct during pregnancy. Reasons for pressing charges included use of <b>illicit</b> drugs, <b>consumption</b> of alcohol, and failure to comply with a doctor's order of bedrest or caesarean section. Drug addicts have been accused of [...] "supplying drugs to a minor" [...] through unintentional chemical subjection via the umbilical cord. Others have been charged with assault with a deadly weapon with the [...] "deadly weapon" [...] in question being an illegal drug. Minnesota, Wisconsin and South Dakota allow women who continue to use substances while pregnant to be civilly committed. Some states require that medical providers report any infant who is born with a physical dependency, or who tests positive for residual traces of alcohol or drugs, to child welfare authorities.|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the adverse personal, family, peer and school situations encountered by adolescent students who had returned to school after being suspended. This was a large-scale study involving a representative population of Taiwanese adolescents. A total of 8, 494 adolescent students in Southern Taiwan were recruited {{in the study and}} completed the questionnaires. The relationships between their experiences of suspension from school and adverse personal, family, peer, and school situations were examined. The results indicated that 178 (2. 1 %) participants had been suspended from school at some time. Compared with students who had never been suspended, those who had experienced suspension {{were more likely to report}} depression, low self-esteem, insomnia, alcohol <b>consumption,</b> <b>illicit</b> drug use, low family support, low family monitoring, high family conflict, habitual alcohol <b>consumption,</b> <b>illicit</b> drug use by family members, low rank and decreased satisfaction in their peer group, having peers with substance use and deviant behaviors, low connectedness to school, and poor academic achievement. These results indicate that adolescent students who have returned to school after suspension encounter numerous adverse situations. The psychological conditions and social contexts of these individuals need to be understood in depth, and intervention programs should be developed to help them to adjust when they return to school and to prevent school dropouts in the future...|$|R
40|$|Background: The use of {{tattoos and}} piercings has increased, {{especially}} among {{adolescents in the}} last decades. Aim: To evaluate the prevalence of these behaviors in adolescents and their association with risk behaviors such as alcohol, tobacco and illicit drug use and sexual promiscuity. Material and Methods: An anonymous and confidential survey about tattooing and piercings was applied to randomly selected high school teenagers, attending municipal, private-subsidized and private schools, in four sectors of Santiago (north-east, south-east, north-west, south-west). Results: The surveys were answered by 1329 participants {{with a mean age}} of 15 years (62 % women) from 9 schools in Santiago. The prevalence of tattoos was 1. 7 % (confidence intervals (CI) 1. 1 % to 2. 5 %). The figure for piercings was 30. 6 % (CI 28. 2 to 33. 1 %). A higher prevalence of tattooing and piercings was observed in groups with a history of psychiatric disorders, criminal records, alcohol, tobacco and <b>illicit</b> drug <b>consumption</b> and initiation of sexual activity (p < 0, 001). Conclusions: This study confirms that tattoos and piercings are indicators of adolescent risk behaviors...|$|R
