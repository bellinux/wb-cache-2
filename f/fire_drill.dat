5|$|The {{first trial}} show {{took place in}} November 2010 in Studio HQ2. The half-hour test show {{featured}} a power failure and a <b>fire</b> <b>drill,</b> which involved a full evacuation of the audience and crew. The first programme filmed at MediaCityUK was Don't Scare the Hare in February 2011, {{and the first to}} transfer was A Question of Sport, the same month. BBC employees started transferring to the development in May 2011, a process that took 36 weeks. BBC Director General Mark Thompson confirmed that up to a further 1,000 jobs could be created or transferred to the site. In January 2012 the BBC was accused of not supporting the community by MP, Hazel Blears, after it was reported that only 26 of 680 jobs created at the development had gone to residents of Salford.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{were unable}} to enter the silos as OSHA ruled them to be too {{hazardous}} after the explosion. They were only able to access the area after the silos were demolished. By the time this took place, {{four months after the}} disaster, investigators believed that the explosion started in a basement area beneath the silos, from which sugar was fed up to the packaging building on conveyor belts. The factory's outdated construction materials and methods are believed to have contributed to the severity of the blaze. The ceiling was of wooden tongue and groove design. The creosote used throughout was known as “fat lighter,” because of the fire risk it posed. Interviews of Imperial Sugar employees conducted by OSHA uncovered a lack of training, as 40 of the workers reported never receiving training on how to exit the building in an emergency. Only five employees recalled having a <b>fire</b> <b>drill.</b>|$|E

25|$|After {{a lengthy}} {{interview}} with the facility's security officer, he was accepted for training. He signed a contract forbidding disclosure of sensitive security materials, and had to promise not to visit any Arab or Communist countries for five years after his employment at the facility ended. He passed health checks, after which his training began. He was put through an intensive training course in physics, chemistry, mathematics, first aid, <b>fire</b> <b>drill,</b> and English. He did sufficiently well to be accepted, and was employed as a nuclear plant technician and shift manager in February 1977. Vanunu earned a high salary by Israeli standards, and lived well. His work record was so good he qualified for a car and telephone allowance, though he {{had no interest in}} either and simply had his brother Meir's car registered in his name and had the telephone installed at his parent's house.|$|E

Veronica and Wallace talk to each other while Keith and Alicia watch a movie. Alicia tries to convince Wallace to accept their relationship to no avail. After talking to Mac (Tina Majorino), another student, Pete (Michael McMillian) approaches Veronica to say that he saw two students, Ben (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) and Norris (Theo Rossi) with exploding tennis balls. Wallace places the two students under more suspicion when he tells Veronica about them, and Veronica sees a mysterious timer.|$|E

30|$|In the experiments, a 10 -story {{building}} was used and 6 people {{were placed on}} each floor. The scheduled fire was set on the 10 th floor. The same number of stairs, elevators, and exits with the same locations were used for each experiment. Two different age groups were tested: young adults vs. older adults. Older adults had more physical limitations than young adults in terms of walking speed and sight distance. For each age group, two experiments were conducted: one with the agents who had <b>fire</b> <b>drills</b> {{and the other with}} the agents who had no <b>fire</b> <b>drills.</b> Those who had <b>fire</b> <b>drills</b> could find stairs and exits more quickly than those who had not.|$|R

500|$|The crew {{realised}} {{that the}} aircraft would {{not last long}} enough to enable a landing back on 28L, and declared a Mayday. Davis cleared the aircraft to land on runway 05R, which was [...] long. He also instructed two other aircraft to perform a go-around, as runway 05R crossed runway 28R, which they were due to land on and Davis {{did not know whether}} Flight 712 would be able to stop before reaching that runway. The crew accepted Davis's offer of runway 05R, even though it was much shorter and not equipped with ILS. Taylor was able to safely land the aircraft on 05R, using wheel brakes and reversing the outboard engines' thrust to halt the aircraft. [...] The aircraft touched down about [...] beyond the threshold and stopped in [...] [...] Taylor asked Davis for permission to evacuate, but the cabin crew were already opening the emergency doors. The flight crew started the <b>fire</b> <b>drill,</b> but the port wing exploded before this could be completed. As a result, the fire shut off handles were not pulled, and the booster pumps and electrical supply were left switched on. Due to the short period of time between the Mayday being declared at 15:29 and the aircraft landing at 15:31, {{there was no time for}} the emergency services to lay a carpet of foam, which was standard practice at the time.|$|E

2500|$|Fire was {{a serious}} danger to wooden ships like Liberty, {{particularly}} steamers due to their use of fireboxes and boilers.

[...] The schooner Oregon, tied at the dock and loading cargo, was damaged by the fire. [...] Oregon would have been completely destroyed, but Liberty came along and towed the schooner away from the fire.

2500|$|Although {{the captain}} was {{ultimately}} responsible {{for the safety of}} passengers, the owners had made no effort to maintain or replace the ship's safety equipment. The fire hoses had been allowed to rot, and fell apart when the crew tried to put out the fire. The crew had never practiced a <b>fire</b> <b>drill,</b> and the lifeboats were tied up and inaccessible. (Some claim they were wired and painted in place.) Survivors reported that the life preservers were useless and fell apart in their hands. Desperate mothers placed life jackets on their children and tossed them into the water, only to watch in horror as their children sank instead of floating. [...] Most of those on board were women and children who, like most Americans of the time, could not swim; victims found that their heavy wool clothing absorbed water and weighed them down in the river.|$|E
