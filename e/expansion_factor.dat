40|$|Reliable {{estimates}} of heavy-truck volumes {{are important in}} a number of transportation applications. Estimates of truck volumes are necessary for pavement design and pavement management. Truck volumes are important in traffic safety. The number of trucks on the road also influences roadway capacity and traffic operations. Additionally, heavy vehicles pollute at higher rates than passenger vehicles. Consequently, reliable {{estimates of}} heavy-truck vehicle miles traveled (VMT) are important in creating accurate inventories of on-road emissions. This research evaluated three different methods to calculate heavy-truck annual average daily traffic (AADT) which can subsequently be used to estimate vehicle miles traveled (VMT). Traffic data from continuous count stations provided by the Iowa DOT were used to estimate AADT for two different truck groups (single-unit and multi-unit) using the three methods. The first method developed monthly and daily <b>expansion</b> <b>factors</b> for each truck group. The second and third methods created general <b>expansion</b> <b>factors</b> for all vehicles. Accuracy of the three methods was compared using n-fold cross-validation. In n-fold cross-validation, data are split into n partitions, and data from the nth partition are used to validate the remaining data. A comparison of the accuracy of the three methods was made using the estimates of prediction error obtained from cross-validation. The prediction error was determined by averaging the squared error between the estimated AADT and the actual AADT. Overall, the prediction error was the lowest for the method that developed <b>expansion</b> <b>factors</b> separately for the different truck groups for both single- and multi-unit trucks. This indicates that use of <b>expansion</b> <b>factors</b> specific to heavy trucks results in better estimates of AADT, and, subsequently, VMT, than using aggregate <b>expansion</b> <b>factors</b> and applying a percentage of trucks. Monthly, daily, and weekly traffic patterns were also evaluated. Significant variation exists in the temporal and seasonal patterns of heavy trucks as compared to passenger vehicles. This suggests that the use of aggregate <b>expansion</b> <b>factors</b> fails to adequately describe truck travel patterns...|$|R

Biomass in each tree component, i. e. foliage, branch, and stem, was quantified by destructive tree harvesting. Allometric regression equations of each tree component were significant (P< 0. 05) with diameter at breast height (DBH) accounting for 80 - 96 % of the variation except for branch biomass in high density or foliage and cone biomass in low density. Generalized allometric equations can be used to estimate the biomass of C. japonica plantations because the slopes of allometric equations were not significantly different by the stand density.

40|$|Belgian forests covered 693 181 ha in 2000, {{representing}} 22. 7 % of {{the total}} land area. As no biomass or carbon stock data {{are included in the}} Flemish and Walloon regional forest inventories, species-specific wood densities, biomass <b>expansion</b> <b>factors</b> s. s. and carbon content values were critically selected from the literature. Based on these conversion and <b>expansion</b> <b>factors,</b> and on data from the forest inventories, the total C-stock in the living biomass of productive Belgian forests was assessed at 60. 9 Mt C in the year 2000. The overall mean C-stock amounted to 101. 0 t C ha(- 1). This value was in the higher range of values reported for the neighbouring countries, mainly due to a high mean growing stock in the Belgian forests (261. 9 m(3) ha(- 1)). The conversion from wood volume to wood biomass based on wood density values reported in the literature appeared to introduce the largest variability in the assessment of the carbon stocks. Additional measurements of wood densities in Belgian forests could help to reduce the uncertainty related to this factor. Because of the time-consuming and destructive character of the determination of biomass <b>expansion</b> <b>factors</b> s. s.
