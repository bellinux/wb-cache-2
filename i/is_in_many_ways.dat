5|$|Though the {{structure}} of the Earthsea novels <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> typical of fantasy, it has been described as subverting the tropes of this genre. The protagonists of her stories, with the exception of Tenar, were all dark-skinned, in comparison to the white-skinned heroes more traditionally used. The Tombs of Atuan examines the development of a young girl in great detail, a choice unusual for a fantasy writer of the period in which the book was written.|$|E
5|$|In {{the modern}} era, {{population}} peaked {{in the mid}} 19th century at just over 32,000 and declined for a century thereafter {{to a low of}} fewer than 18,000 in the 1970s. Declines were particularly significant in the outlying islands, some of which remain vulnerable to ongoing losses. Although Orkney <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> very distinct from the other islands and archipelagos of Scotland these trends are very similar to those experienced elsewhere. The archipelago's population grew by 11% in the decade to 2011 as recorded by the census. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.|$|E
5|$|Schlosberg's contribution, <b>is,</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways,</b> a {{response}} to challenges made to his Defining Environmental Justice (2007). Schlosberg aims to step beyond previous accounts of animal rights or environmentalism as requirements of justice by deploying a mixed capabilities/deliberation approach applicable to both ecosystems and nonhuman animals. Schlosberg challenges criticisms of his capabilities approach (specifically, a capabilities approach which moves beyond humans) grounded {{in the existence of}} conflicts of capabilities, claiming that a form of deliberative democracy can overcome the problem posed by these conflicts. His mixed account, he claims, provides a form of justice appropriate for thinking about human and nonhuman individuals and collectives in the Anthropocene.|$|E

5|$|The poem <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> deeply Christian, with {{frequent}} {{references to the}} fall of Adam and Eve and to Jesus Christ. Scholars have debated {{the depth of the}} Christian elements within the poem by looking at {{it in the context of}} the age in which it was written, coming up with varying views as to what represents a Christian element of the poem and what does not. For example, some critics compare Sir Gawain to the other three poems of the Gawain manuscript. Each has a heavily Christian theme, causing scholars to interpret Gawain similarly. Comparing it to the poem Cleanness (also known as Purity), for example, they see it as a story of the apocalyptic fall of a civilisation, in Gawain's case, Camelot. In this interpretation, Sir Gawain is like Noah, separated from his society and warned by the Green Knight (who is seen as God's representative) of the coming doom of Camelot. Gawain, judged worthy through his test, is spared the doom of the rest of Camelot. King Arthur and his knights, however, misunderstand Gawain's experience and wear garters themselves. In Cleanness the men who are saved are similarly helpless in warning their society of impending destruction.|$|E
25|$|Although LSE is a {{constituent}} {{college of the}} federal University of London, it <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> comparable with free-standing, self-governing and independently funded universities, and it awards its own degrees.|$|E
25|$|The Community of Christ {{is rooted}} in Restorationist traditions. Although in some respects it is {{congruent}} with mainline Protestant Christian attitudes, it <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> theologically distinct, continuing such features as prophetic revelation. It is the second-largest denomination within the Latter Day Saint movement.|$|E

25|$|The Need for Achievement <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> {{similar to}} the need for mastery and {{self-actualization}} in Maslow's hierarchy of needs and growth in the ERG theory.

25|$|The {{science of}} {{producing}} good stockfish <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> {{comparable to that}} of making a good cognac, Parma ham, or a well-matured cheese. The Slow Food movement insists that all these artisanal products must be made on a small scale and given time to mature.|$|E
25|$|Renoir's last film is Le Petit théâtre de Jean Renoir (The Little Theatre of Jean Renoir, 1969). The film is {{a series}} of four short films made in a variety of styles. It <b>is,</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways,</b> one of his most challenging, avant-garde and {{unconventional}} works.|$|E

25|$|Tuten's {{most recent}} novel, The Green Hour (2002), <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> a {{departure}} from the others. The setting is the present day, and the characters are not borrowed from history. Further, it lacks much of the impertinent humor and ethereal feel of his previous works. The story recounts the 30-year love affair between an academic and a spiritual vagabond.|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of recombinant DNA <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> the simplest {{step of the}} molecular cloning process. DNA prepared from the vector and foreign source are simply mixed together at appropriate concentrations and exposed to an enzyme (DNA ligase) that covalently links the ends together. This joining reaction is often termed ligation. The resulting DNA mixture containing randomly joined ends is then ready for introduction into the host organism.|$|E
25|$|Exploring Music is {{an internationally}} {{syndicated}} radio program featuring classical music, with commentary and analysis by host Bill McGlaughlin. It is a daily, one-hour {{show with a}} single in-depth theme each week. The show, which debuted in 2003, is produced by WFMT Radio Network. Exploring Music <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> {{the heir to the}} late Karl Haas' popular long-running show, Adventures in Good Music, expanded and updated for a 21st-century audience.|$|E

25|$|On leaving Portugal, he {{abandoned}} {{the use of}} rhyme as cramping freedom of thought and expression; nevertheless his highly polished verses are generally robust to hardness and overdone with archaisms. His translations from Latin, French and Italian, are accurate though harsh, and his renderings of Racine and the Fables of Lafontaine entirely lack the simplicity and grace of the originals. But Nascimento's blank verse translation of the Martyrs <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> superior to Chateaubriand's prose.|$|E
25|$|In Italy, Petrarch {{developed}} the sonnet form pioneered by Giacomo da Lentini and Dante's Vita Nuova. In 1327, {{according to the}} poet, {{the sight of a}} woman called Laura in the church of Sainte-Claire d'Avignon awoke in him a lasting passion, celebrated in the Rime sparse ("Scattered rhymes"). Later, Renaissance poets who copied Petrarch's style named this collection of 366 poems Il Canzoniere ("The Song Book"). Laura <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> both the culmination of medieval courtly love poetry and the beginning of Renaissance love lyric.|$|E
25|$|These {{were the}} great years for Andrews. He played 142 matches for Somerset in these 5 seasons {{out of the}} 144 that Somerset played. He missed just 2 matches through injury in July 1939. This ended a run of 127 {{consecutive}} games for the county, a Somerset record at the time. This <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> impressive but from a negative point of view it does also indicate that he was never selected to play for England nor was he ever chosen for other important matches like Gentlemen v Players.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} of the group algebra for a given group <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> analogous to constructing the universal enveloping algebra for a given Lie algebra. Both constructions are universal and translate representation theory into module theory. Furthermore, both group algebras and universal enveloping algebras carry natural comultiplications which turn them into Hopf algebras. This is made precise in the article on the tensor algebra: the tensor algebra has a Hopf algebra structure on it, and because the Lie bracket is consistent with (obeys the consistency conditions for) that Hopf structure, it is inherited by the universal enveloping algebra.|$|E
25|$|And {{by adding}} the {{population}} of western Scania to the same of Metropolitan area of Copenhagen, then close to 3 million people live around the Øresund sea, within a maximum distance from Øresund of 25 to 30 kilometres. At a land surface of approx. 6100km2 (approx 460 inhabitants/km2). This <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> a better measurement of describing the area around Øresund than what the far wider Øresund Region constitutes, as the latter includes also eastern Scania (whose beaches are Baltic Sea ones and is far less populated) as well as entire Denmark east of Great Belt.|$|E
25|$|Philip Sidney {{was central}} to Scott's {{conception}} of what poetry was and what it could achieve, and in the Model he cites Astrophel and Stella, the Arcadia and, of course, An Apology for Poetry. Gavin Alexander writes that The model of poesy <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> a commentary on The defence of poesy, adopting its basic theory, filling in its gaps, interrogating and weighing its sources, glossing and elaborating its difficulties. But {{it is also a}} very different sort of work, a much more ambitious and comprehensive exercise inspired by the Defence but not bounded or constrained by it' (p. liii).|$|E
