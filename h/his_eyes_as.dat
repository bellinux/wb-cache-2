5|$|Alan begins {{driving the}} car down the road, and sees Frank Jr. and Betty in front of him. They look behind to wave to Alan, and he waves back. However, the pair keep driving while looking backwards. Observing that a {{railroad}} with an oncoming train is near, Alan desperately tries to signal to them to stop waving and look ahead. When they do not pay attention to him and continue waving, Alan shields <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> the two drive right {{into the path of}} the train and are killed. Back in the present, at the funeral, Hal enters his police car, and decides to go back on the road in order to prevent more traffic accidents from occurring.|$|E
5|$|Alexander swore {{the oath}} of loyalty to the Greek {{constitution}} {{on the afternoon of}} 11 June 1917 in the ballroom of the Royal Palace. Apart from the Archbishop of Athens, Theocletus I, who administered the oath, only King Constantine I, Crown Prince George and the king's prime minister, Alexandros Zaimis, attended. There were no festivities. The 23-year-old Alexander had a broken voice and tears in <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> he made the solemn declaration. He knew that the Entente and the Venizelists would hold real power and that neither his father nor his brother had renounced their claims to the throne. Constantine had informed his son that he should consider himself a regent, rather than a true monarch.|$|E

Cotto's performance was described as a result of hand speed and accuracy. During the fight Bailey received punches in his face that opened cuts over and under both of <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>As</b> a result of the cuts Bailey was examined by the ringside physician. Following this Bailey expressed that he didn't want to continue and the referee stopped the fight at 1:39 of the sixth round. Eleven days later, on December 22, 2004 the Puerto Rican boxing commission named Cotto as Puerto Rico's fighter of the year for 2004.|$|E

25|$|Watching Shastri bat is like {{admiring the}} Qutub Minar; tall, timeless, solid. You admire {{it for the}} virtues, not for its style. For nine hours and 21 minutes, he chiselled away the England attack and the {{sculpture}} that he left behind represented perseverance and craft. There was the usual stoic, expressionless face under the helmet, but {{you could see the}} determination in <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> he planted himself at the wicket, struck root and bore fruit.|$|E
60|$|Lord Ormersfield {{had heard}} these few last words, {{and there was}} deep thought in <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> he bade <b>his</b> cousins {{farewell}} at the hall door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, child, what is it?" [...] she asked, {{catching}} <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> {{he stole}} a shy glance at her, {{one of many}} which she had not seen.|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{of which}} you know to be a lie," [...] the Jerseyman said, still {{speaking}} quietly but fixing the fellow with <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> if to hold closely his attention.|$|R
25|$|When Chris dies, he {{experiences}} {{symptoms of}} a near death experience. As pain gradually leaves his body, he observes a tunnel of light and views his dead body from above, connected to himself by a silver cord. He then experiences his life flashing before <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>as</b> the events in his life unfold in reverse. This last experience occurs again later, much more slowly, while he's a ghost. Albert later compares it to purgatory, {{a time when people}} are forced to re-examine their lives without rationalization.|$|E
25|$|Loeb is {{best remembered}} nationally for his alleged role in attacking Edmund Muskie through The Union Leader {{in what is}} known locally as the Canuck letter, derailing the Maine senator's 1972 presidential bid. Loeb {{is said to have}} helped in the forgery and {{publication}} of the letter in the paper's op-ed section. The letter slandered French-Canadians, and implied Muskie was prejudiced against them. Muskie's emotional defense of himself in front of the Union Leader offices in Manchester was seen as a sign of weakness and instability. Muskie later claimed that there were not tears in <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>as</b> many papers reported, but rather snowflakes (as it had been snowing that evening).|$|E
25|$|According to Khurram Mahmood If {{we observe}} only Punjab {{as being a}} Muslim {{majority}} province, there was no support for Muslim League, of any type from rural areas except some limited urban circles. Therefore, to secure the support of Muslim masses, Jinnah comprehended that it was essential to reorganise PPML. Jinnah was much concerned {{about the future of}} League in Punjab, because being a Muslim majority province it held a significant position in <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>As</b> far as the re-organization of League was concerned, it was a long-term plan and could take several years, but election was due shortly. Therefore, Jinnah decided to co-opt with Unionist Party. For him it was the best solution as a short cut to the successful rebirth of Punjab Muslim League.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, sir. He {{would keep}} it under <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>as</b> it were. Why not? It is natural. A fellow doesn't put his swag underground, unless there's {{a very good}} reason for it." ...|$|R
25|$|Nicholas's life passes before <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> he falls. He smashes {{through a}} glass roof and lands on a giant air bag. Emergency medical {{technicians}} carefully remove him, and he finds himself in a ballroom full of his friends, family, and every figure involved in his Game; it had been just a game all along. Conrad is alive and well, and explains that he initiated the game to get his brother to embrace life and not to end up like their father. Nicholas bursts into tears, relaxes, and begins to enjoy the party once his shock has dissipated. When he sees that Christine has left the party, he follows her outside to her cab. He asks her to dinner, and she offers to share a coffee with him before her flight takes her to her next game assignment in Australia.|$|E
25|$|Kate and Sawyer {{travel to}} Hydra Island via Desmond's boat Elizabeth, {{to the site}} of the Ajira Airlines plane where Lapidus, Richard and Miles have been quickly trying to make it air-worthy. Kate convinces Claire she can help her raise Aaron and they head for the plane. After Kate, Sawyer and Claire board the plane, Lapidus {{successfully}} gets it off the island. Jack leads Hurley and Ben back to the heart of the Island, where Jack convinces an emotional Hurley to take over as the protector of the island, stating Hurley was always meant to be the leader. Hurley and Ben lower Jack to the dry pool where he rescues a barely conscious Desmond. Jack manages to restore the light by replacing the stone plug, and is enveloped in the light that surrounds him. Hurley, in his role as the new protector of the island, does not know what to do. Ben tells him he should help Desmond get home and suggests there may be a better way of protecting the island than how Jacob did. Hurley asks him for help, and Ben is honored. Jack reawakens outside by a river and walks toward the bamboo forest. After Jack collapses to the ground, Vincent approaches him and lies next to him. Jack gazes happily at the sky while watching the Ajira plane fly overhead away from the island. Jack slowly closes <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> he dies.|$|E
500|$|His father coached {{him until}} high school, and was {{especially}} tough. When Kinsler was 13 years old, {{and the best}} player on a PONY league team coached by his father that was playing for a championship, his dad caught Kinsler rolling <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> he gave the team orders. [...] "I benched him, without hesitation", said his father. With Kinsler on the bench, the team lost the game.|$|E
60|$|To-night Mr. Ketchmaid, meeting <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> {{he entered}} the bar, nodded curtly. The {{shoemaker}} had stayed away three days as a protest, and the landlord was naturally indignant at such contumacy.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] said old Mr. Salton, [...] "it {{is quite}} time you young people {{departed}} for that honeymoon of yours!" [...] There was {{a twinkle in}} <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> he spoke.|$|R
6000|$|... "There are one or {{two things}} that I am not up to yet," [...] he answered, with a laugh {{in the corner of}} <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>as</b> he waxed <b>his</b> thread with a flourish.|$|R
500|$|.....here is none {{today who}} can replace the noble personality, that keen {{energetic}} brain ever {{ready to give}} of its wonderful store of knowledge, and that happy spirit ever bright, ever optimistic, even though crushed beneath the cruel and unjust blow of the non-acceptance of his prize design for the North Shore bridge. [...] "It will crown my life" [...] he said. We will always remember the bright gleam in <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> they peered beyond the anxiety of today, looked afar to the future glory of his beloved Sydney where in his dreams he saw his mighty bridge spanning what he called [...] "God's noblest waterway".|$|E
500|$|At {{approximately}} 12 {{midnight on}} 21 September 1986, Wood {{went to the}} playroom in the mansion and killed his mistress Danielle Ledez by shooting her once in the head. [...] Ledez was 10 weeks pregnant by Wood. [...] Wood then proceeded to play hide-and-seek with Ledez's daughter Stephanie (aged 3), after which he led her into Christopher's bedroom and shot her twice in the head, killing her instantly. He then took Ledez's son Christopher (aged 5) {{into the bathroom and}} told him to close <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> he had a surprise for him, then shot him twice in the head. Wood then bludgeoned the boy with a large ruler four or five times {{in the back of the}} head.|$|E
500|$|Some reports {{indicate}} that during Queen Mary I's reign bystanders were vocal in their support: while in transit convicts sometimes suffered directly {{at the hands of}} the crowd. [...] William Wallace was whipped, attacked and had rotten food and waste thrown at him, and the priest Thomas Pilchard was reportedly barely alive by the time he reached the gallows in 1587. [...] Others found themselves admonished by [...] "zealous and godly men"; it became customary for a preacher to follow the condemned, asking them to repent. [...] According to Samuel Clarke, the Puritan clergyman William Perkins (1558–1602) once managed to convince a young man at the gallows that he had been forgiven, enabling the youth to go to his death [...] "with tears of joy in <b>his</b> <b>eyes...</b> <b>as</b> if he actually saw himself delivered from the hell which he feared before, and heaven opened for receiving his soul".|$|E
60|$|Apparently Cuffy was of {{the same}} opinion, for he did not wag even the point of his tail, and there was {{something}} dubious in the glance of <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> he waited for more.|$|R
6000|$|... "One of Sankey's hymns," [...] {{said the}} sergeant, with the remotest {{semblance of a}} twinkle in <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>as</b> he took a small hymn-book from under his pillow {{and gave it to}} his friend.|$|R

500|$|Everyone who was {{fortunate}} enough to be in the audience agreed that it was the musical event of their lives, and after the performance of the last number there was an ovation to the composer which I have never seen equalled anywhere, the entire audience rose to their feet and shouted with enthusiasm, and probably the calmest man in the whole hall was the composer himself; he bowed repeatedly with that distinction of manner which was so typical of him... As calm as Sibelius had appeared on the stage, after his part was over he came up stairs and sank into a chair in one of the dressing rooms and was very much overcome. Some people declared that he wept. Personally I do not think that he did, but there were tears in <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> he shook our hands and thanked us for what he was pleased to call the [...] "honor we had done him".|$|E
2500|$|While {{teaching}} Torah, Judah {{would often}} interrupt the lesson {{to recite the}} Shema Yisrael. He passed his hand over <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> he said it. (Berachot 13b) ...|$|E
2500|$|...

6000|$|... "Good-by." [...] He {{still held}} her hand. Presently he drew {{her back into}} the room, closing the door carefully, and glancing around. There was a look of {{profound}} cunning in <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> he said slowly,-- ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{no mistaking}} the sly leer which {{appeared}} in <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> he spoke. Lydie felt her cheeks flaming up with sudden wrath; wrath, which as quickly gave way to an awful, an unconquerable horror.|$|R
6000|$|I. Ber. [...] At least, [...] It lulled suspicion, showing confidence. [...] Had I been silent, not a Sbirro[410] but [...] Had kept me in <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>as</b> meditating [...] A silent, solitary, deep revenge. [...] 30 ...|$|R
