To achieve seamless localization from outdoors to indoors, a handover technique that accurately provides a starting position to the indoor localization system is needed.

A number of possible alternatives have been analysed to adopt the European Rail Traffic Management System/European Train Control System (ERTMS/ETCS) control system on local/regional lines to improve transport capacity. Among them, a communication system based on public networks (cellular&satellite) provides an interesting, effective and alternative solution to proprietary and expensive radio networks. To analyse performance of this solution, {{it is necessary to}} model the end-to-end delay and message loss to fully characterize the message transfer process from train to ground and vice versa. Starting from the results of a railway test campaign over a 300 km railway line for a cumulative 12, 000 traveled km in 21 days, in this paper, we derive a statistical model for the end-to-end delay required for delivering messages. In particular, we propose a two states model allowing for reproducing the main behavioral characteristics of the end-to-end delay as observed experimentally. Model formulation has been derived after deep analysis of the recorded experimental data. When it is applied to model a realistic scenario, it allows for explicitly accounting for radio coverage characteristics, the received power level, the <b>handover</b> <b>points</b> along the line and for the serving radio technology. As an example, the proposed model is used to generate the end-to-end delay profile in a realistic scenario...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of {{this paper}} Wireless Sensor Network {{technologies}} are now available to implement real time temperature monitoring systems in food supply chains. The aim {{of this paper}} is to examine different types of methods and criteria to establish alerts in decision support systems in perishable food supply chains. Design/methodology/approach Logistic and temperature mapping was performed in cod supply chains to obtain data to establish criteria for temperature alerts. Data was collected for both ambient temperature and temperature of products packed in Expanded Polystyrene boxes. Findings Alerts based on single criterion for ambient temperature resulted in false alerts when compared to criteria for product temperature. More complex methods that took into account both temperature abuse and the severity of the abuse resulted in more relevant alerts for the chilled cod supply chain. Research limitations/implications The research is based on mapping of cod supply chains with a limited number of iterations. Practical implications The scope of the research is the application of WSN in an actual supply chain of chilled cod transported from Iceland to Europe, which has relevance in assisting management decision making in the supply chain to prevent losses of quality and minimize waste.

40|$|A full {{engagement}} of a missile against an attacking missile {{consists of three}} phases: launch, mid-course and terminal homing phase. For long or medium range engagement the missile generally cannot lock on to the target so that the mid-course guidance law will {{be applied to the}} missile. Mid-course guidance phase refers to the procedure that guides the missile to a terminal <b>handover</b> <b>point</b> in order to acquire the target motion through its on-board sensor. The mid-course guidance law differs significantly from the guidance logic for the terminal homing phase due to the inherited characteristic of the mid-course guidance: it must not only find the best condition for the terminal homing phase, but also deliver the missile to that condition using only the target motion data updated by the external source such as a plane, ship, or ground base. Although {{there are a number of}} objectives for the mid-course guidance, it is possible to classify them into two main categories. Firstly, the onus is on the mid-course guidance to achieve the best terminal handover condition, i. e. to provide certainty that the missile can reach the target. For a target at a great distance, the mid-course guidance opts to maximize the terminal velocity and/or minimize the energy loss in order to gain high velocity and manoeuvrability advantages for the terminal homing guidance. Minimizing the flight time is commonly relevant to a close in target problem, since the missile should intercept the target before attacking its objective (Song and Tahk, 1998). The necessary conditions for an optimal mid-course guidance problem form a two-point boundary-value problem (Kirk, 1970). However, it is unfeasible not only to derive the analytical solution but also to find a numerical solution in real time by any present-day on-board computer. Several approaches have been proposed to solve the optimal mid-course guidance problem. Song and Tah...|$|E
40|$|Wi-Fi and {{smartphone}} based positioning {{technologies are}} playing a more and more important role for tracking and positioning due to the rapid development of the smartphone market. However, the low positioning accuracy of these technologies is still an issue for indoor positioning. This {{research is part of}} an Australian Research Council (ARC) project required by a large global shopping mall company located in Australia. It aims to develop an effective customer tracking approach for acquiring shopping behavior of customers and providing better services. Currently, the log data provided by the company only records one Wi-Fi connection at a time for each smartphone user, which makes most of the conventional tracking and positioning methods inapplicable. Only the cell of origin (CoO) method can be selected for the customer tracking and positioning. The designated shopping mall floor was initially partitioned using Voronoi diagram based on the distribution of the access point (AP) and received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values. However, the cells created by the Voronoi diagram did not reflect the real indoor complexity of the surrounding environment. In order to solve this problem, a new algorithm called the common hand over point determination (CHOPD) algorithm was developed, in which the statistical RSSI values from the real Wi-Fi network log data are used for the spatial and temporal position calculation of the <b>handover</b> <b>point</b> (HOP). The boundary of the cell can be determined once the HOP position is calculated. The RSSI values are detected by the Wi-Fi network from the smartphone carried by each customer walking on the shopping mall floor as they passed through two adjacent APs. The new algorithm was tested in a large shopping-mall-like space and 100 test sampling records were used for the HOP calculation. The results from the new algorithm were assessed and were found to be within 9 cm difference from the true HOP location...|$|E

40|$|The {{bus driver}} {{scheduling}} problem involves assigning {{a set of}} drivers to cover all available bus work such that every bus is assigned a driver, the number of duties is minimised and each duty conforms to the rules governing them regarding maximum driving time and so on. Generally this problem is solved using mathematical programming methods. The University of Leeds has developed a driver scheduling system, TRACS-I I, that solves the bus driver scheduling problem by first generating a large set of potential duties and selecting a subset of these via the associated set covering ILP to form the schedule. The size of the set of potential duties used by TRACS-I I {{is directly related to}} the number of relief opportunities present in the original bus schedule. Each relief opportunity potentially serves as a <b>handover</b> <b>point</b> between two bus shifts. A bus schedule containing many relief opportunities can have a very large set of potential shifts generated to cover the buswork. The complexity of the ILP is related to the number of relief opportunities present in the bus schedule. This thesis describes a pre-processing stage for the TRACS-I I scheduling system. The pre-processor selects potentially useful relief opportunities from the bus schedule. The shifts generated by TRACS-I I are restricted to the subset of relief opportunities made available to it by the pre-processor. The reduction of the number of relief opportunities serves to reduce the complexity of the resulting set covering problem by reducing the number of variables and constraints in the ILP. The pre-processor itself uses constraint programming to find several possible ways of selecting relief opportunities from the morning and evening portions of the bus schedule. This is done by exploiting useful properties found in good driver schedules, specifically the chaining together of driver duties such that when one driver takes a break another driver finishing a break continues on the same bus. The pre-processor described has been shown to be effective on a wide variety of schedules in that the minimum number of drivers is almost always used and, in some cases, cheaper schedules can be produced...|$|E
40|$|Ubiquitous {{positioning}} {{and people}} mobility tracking {{has become one}} of the critical parts of our daily life. As a core element of the Location Based Services (LBS), the ubiquitous positioning capability necessitates seamless positioning across both indoor and outdoor environments. Nowadays, tracking outdoor with a relatively high accuracy and reliability can be achieved using matured technologies such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). However, it is still challenging for tracking in indoor environments such as airports, shopping malls and museums. The demand for indoor tracking has driven the fast development of indoor positioning and tracking technologies, especially Wi-Fi, RFID and smartphone etc. All these technologies have significantly enhanced the convenience of people&rsquo;s daily life and the competitiveness of business firms. With the rapidly increased ubiquity of Wi-Fi enabled mobile phones and tablets, developing a robust location and mobility tracking system utilising such technologies will have a great potential for industry innovation and applications. This research is part of an Australian Research Council (ARC) project that involves two universities and one industry partner who is a large global shopping mall management company located in Australia. The project aims to develop a smart system for robust modelling and analysing the shopping behaviours of customers so that value-added services can be effectively provided. A number of field tests have been conducted and a large amount of data has been acquired both in the shopping mall of interest and the RMIT Indoor Positioning Laboratory. A large cohort of real users in the shopping mall were recorded where only one Wi-Fi access point (AP) connection at a time for each mobile device user was provided for our research. This makes most of the conventional tracking and positioning methods inapplicable. To overcome this constraint, a new hybrid system for positioning and mobility tracking &mdash; called single AP-connection location tracking system (SCLTS) was developed, which utilised Wi-Fi, RFID and mobile device technologies and took advantage of both the cell of origin (CoO) and fingerprinting positioning methods. Three new algorithms for Wi-Fi based indoor positioning were developed during this research. They are the common <b>handover</b> <b>point</b> determination (CHOPD) algorithm for determining the boundary of the cell; the algorithm for positioning with the case of same-line-dual-connection (SLDC) in a long narrow space (e. g., a long corridor) and the algorithm for positioning with the case of perpendicular-dual-connection of APs in a T-shape corridor for improving the positioning accuracy. The architecture of the SCLTS system was also developed as part of the implementation of the SCLTS system. Various experiments were conducted in a simulated large shopping-mall-like environment (i. e., the RMIT Indoor Positioning Lab) and the results showed that the performance of the SCLTS developed was very promising and the original goal of the project has been achieved. In addition, the two most popular indoor positioning methods &mdash; trilateration and fingerprinting were also optimised and implemented in a real industrial product and promising results have been achieved...|$|E

40|$|In this work, {{we present}} {{a study of the}} {{existing}} Layer 3 mobility approaches towards suitability for low blackout times during <b>handovers.</b> Our starting <b>point</b> is the well-known Mobile IP protocol specified by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Although the protocol supports mobility of mobile computers and hand-held devices in the Internet, it performs poorly when handovers happen while a communication session is active. Enhancements, such as Fast Mobile IP (FMIP) and Hierarchical Mobile IP (HMIP) have been proposed to handle the drawbacks of Mobile IP. We describe these protocols and discuss other extensions to Mobile IP devised by IETF, as well as non-standardized schemes proposed by other research groups. The selection of extensions is focussed on approaches aiming small Layer 3 blackout times applicable for inter-domain and vertical handovers during ongoing communication sessions. The discussed Layer 3 approaches have been considered in previous work extensively before by means of simulations, analysis, and measurements. Since the scenarios of previous work vary greatly, a comparison of the Layer 3 protocols is hardly possible. Therefore, we compare the blackout times of different schemes analytically for one definition of the blackout time and by four specific scenarios...|$|R
30|$|Early {{telecommunication}} networks were engineered {{in such a}} way that enables offering a steady perceived quality of delivered services during a media session. This goal is achieved through the reservation of resources needed before launching services' delivery processes. Telecoms operators are impelled to select and install suitable transmission mediums and equipment that guarantee a standardized perceived quality for their customers independently of their geographical location and service delivery context. In such a situation, a client request is solely admitted if there are sufficient resources to accommodate it in the transport network. However, the introduction of 2 G cellular telecom systems that deliver services to moving customers induces difficulties to conquer the challenge of keeping a time-constant perceived quality. The principal factors entailing perceived quality fluctuation are <b>handovers</b> among access <b>points</b> and vulnerability of wireless channels to unpredictable interferences and obstacles. It is worth to note here that keeping a steady perceived quality over a mobile telecom system is achievable, but the remedies are unreasonably expensive and impracticable for telecom operators. In reality, mobile customers are more tolerant and tend to accept fluctuations in the perceived quality during a media session given their awareness regarding mobile network features. The integration of delay sensitive telecom services over the best effort IP networks obviously emphasizes the fluctuation of perceived quality of delivered services.|$|R
