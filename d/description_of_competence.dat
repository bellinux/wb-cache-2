40|$|Part 16 : VO FormationInternational audienceBased {{on recent}} {{research}} in business process modeling and management enhanced integration of resource management can be beneficial. In this context appropriate resources {{can be identified}} by matching their profiles with business process requirements. Requirements may be generated from business process models as competence profiles, if advanced modeling techniques that enable detailed modeling are being used. Matching generated profiles to profiles of internal resources (typically maintained by human resource departments) or external business partners (organizations as well as individuals) requires profile descriptions at a similar level of detail. In order to enable sound matching of resource profiles between supplicants and suppliers in collaborative networks, we suggest modeling and system architecture that can handle these challenges. As one main pillar we will present a framework that allows formal <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> profiles {{as well as their}} aggregation to common job profiles; we will outline this approach for the sector of information and communication technology (ICT). Formal description is accomplished by building profiles with the Resource Modeling Language (RML). Regarding architecture we focus on exchange and processing of profile description models. The practical application of our approach is demonstrated by formalization of competence descriptions given by the European e-Competence Framework (eCF) ...|$|E
40|$|While medical {{informed}} consent documents have received much attention {{in literature and}} throughout varying North American legal jurisdictions, the competence needed {{to be able to}} provide {{informed consent}} is often overlooked. This is especially apparent in the medical research field where clinical trials are done with terminally ill human subjects. However, analyzing competence is crucial for the protection of subjects’ autonomy. If informed consent is to be truly considered an expression of autonomous action, then it is necessary that the decision-maker be sufficiently competent to provide that informed consent. Given the vital role that competence plays in proper autonomous decision-making, the following will first engage in an examination of the concept of competence and second the requisite competence needed for terminally ill subjects to be able to provide informed consent to research participation. Since there is still some disagreement regarding the components of competence, first a proper <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> will be provided. This will involve depicting competence as being comprised of four sub-abilities, specifically understanding, appreciation, reasoning, and voluntariness. With the proper depiction of competence, the remainder of this work will contend that current approaches to determine competency requirements are flawed, that the medical research context ought to require more stringent competency requirements than the medical practice context for the terminally ill, and that a Subject Rights Advocate (SRA), unaffiliated with the research study, should be employed to bolster/enhance and evaluate the competence of terminally ill potential subjects, as well as solicit the final informed consent. It will additionally be argued that the method the SRA ought to use in achieving such aims should be based on a conversational approach...|$|E

Proc. of the 7 th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT 2007), ISBN: 9780769529165, pp. 765 - 769, Niigata, Japan, IEEE Computer Society, July 2007 Over {{the years}} competence-based {{approaches}} {{in the field}} of formal and non-formal education are becoming more common and appear to offer the opportunity to develop flexible e-training programs that bare the potential to meet lifelong learning needs. For corporate training a competence-based approach may help in identifying competence gaps towards designing competence development programmes for improving employees’ performance. In order to provide competence based training, a clear <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>competences</b> is needed. However, different organizations may define the same competences in different ways due to different organizational processes. Thus, enabling technologies and infrastructures for facilitating the synchronization for the creation <b>of</b> commonly identifiable <b>competence</b> <b>descriptions</b> are required. In this paper, we argue that the use of web-based observatories as enabling technology for common <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>competences</b> can serve this purpose, and we present the TenC Competence Observatory demonstrating the potential of this approach.

40|$|Awareness of the {{companies}} {{of the importance of}} human resources has been increasing. It is difficult to find a company that does not put effort and financial resources in the process of human resources development in order to improve and optimize their business activity. In doing so, it is necessary to recognize the specific social group of the employed adults. Only in such a way the responsible persons can develop a quality process for the development of their own employees. In this context the term “specific social groups” refers to the age range of employees and to the associated differences prior to knowledge, perception, motivation, internalized patterns gained with education and ability to adapt to changes. With this objective, {{the first part of the}} diploma describes and defines the theoretical aspects of adult education and the importance and development <b>of</b> <b>competences.</b> Since the topic is quite broad, the content is limited to the non-formal education by using modern information technology, the so called “e-learning”. In the second part of the diploma the development process of e-learning in the company X, representing one of the key directions of the company, has been introduced. I outlined the business need for e-learning development which gives us an insight in the developing process, such as reasons, goals and benefits of the implementation plan. The preparation of the “e-learning” materials and documents is also described. In my opinion, human resources development should be viewed as a whole, therefore the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>competences</b> development in the company is also included in this part.

50|$|By the 1980s, the {{theories}} of Stephen Krashen had become the prominent paradigm in SLA. In his theories, often collectively known as the Input Hypothesis, Krashen suggested that language acquisition is driven solely by comprehensible input, language input that learners can understand. Krashen's model was influential {{in the field of}} SLA and also had a large influence on language teaching, but it left some important processes in SLA unexplained. Research in the 1980s was characterized by the attempt to fill in these gaps. Some approaches included Lydia White's <b>descriptions</b> <b>of</b> learner <b>competence,</b> and Manfred Pienemann's use of speech processing models and lexical functional grammar to explain learner output. This period also saw the beginning of approaches based in other disciplines, such as the psychological approach of connectionism.|$|R

50|$|Robert Sternberg {{proposed}} the triarchic theory of intelligence {{to provide a}} more comprehensive <b>description</b> <b>of</b> intellectual <b>competence</b> than traditional differential or cognitive theories of human ability. The triarchic theory describes three fundamental aspects of intelligence. Analytic intelligence comprises the mental processes through which intelligence is expressed. Creative intelligence is necessary when an individual is confronted with a challenge that is nearly, but not entirely, novel or when an individual is engaged in automatizing the performance of a task. Practical intelligence is bound in a sociocultural milieu and involves adaptation to, selection of, and shaping of the environment to maximize fit in the context. The triarchic theory does not argue against the validity of a general intelligence factor; instead, the theory posits that general intelligence is part of analytic intelligence, and only by considering all three aspects of intelligence can the full range of intellectual functioning be fully understood.|$|R

40|$|The {{functional}} and communicative perspective on language advocated in the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), hides the fact that, while the CEFR programmatically emphasises the role <b>of</b> pragmatic <b>competence</b> in language learning, it provides little guidance {{in how to}} transform the domain of language learning, teaching and testing, accordingly. In the present paper, we argue for an extended and more detailed treatment <b>of</b> pragmatic <b>competence</b> {{in the context of}} the CEFR, that we think is necessary to enable practitioners to implement this conception <b>of</b> communicative <b>competence</b> in their everyday work. Whereas a gap between the CEFR’s programmatic vision and practical requirements has been noted and addressed, e. g. by the creation <b>of</b> reference level <b>descriptions</b> (RLDs) for individual languages, the pragmatic component has thus far not been thoroughly covered by the respective initiatives, such as the English Profile. Based on a review of definitions <b>of</b> pragmatic <b>competence</b> in the linguistic literature, we claim that a customised methodology will be necessary to fully integrate pragmatic <b>competence</b> into CEFR-based <b>descriptions</b> <b>of</b> language <b>competence,</b> especially if these descriptions are to be operationalised in language testing and certification. We then present our own approach to the issue <b>of</b> assessing pragmatic <b>competence,</b> which is part of an ongoing research project called Pragmatic Profiling (PRA. PRO). One of the main goals of this project is to establish pragmatic profiles of different varieties of English based on native speaker communicative behaviour, elicited via a variety of tasks in a standardized questionnaire format (the Questionnaire on English Usage), and other methods. The pragmatic norms derived from this empirical data can be directly compared with learner performance, which will ultimately allow us to assess divergence from native speaker norms and, thereby, evaluate levels <b>of</b> developing pragmatic <b>competence</b> in learners. Our primary concern is to point out that more empirical research is needed to link the levels <b>of</b> theoretical <b>description</b> and concrete communicative performance, and that the methodology employed in PRA.

Using a learner corpus of C 1 exam performance (26, 620 words), examinations of vocabulary profiles, word frequencies, keywords, lexical chunks and can-do occurrence were conducted to identify the lexico-grammar required for C 1 students to obtain solid pass scores. It was found that vocabulary belonged largely to the first two thousand most frequent words in English, lexis and chunks displayed some parallels with native-speakers, and language relating to can-do occurrence performed a more productive than interactive or strategic purpose...|$|R
