5|$|In {{the seventh}} inning, Langston allowed a single to Mike Blowers, then allowed Tino Martinez on base via fielder's choice, then hit Joey Cora {{to load the}} bases with two outs. Luis Sojo {{followed}} with a double to right field that glanced off of first baseman J. T. Snow's <b>glove</b> <b>and</b> rolled under the Angels' bullpen bench, scoring Blowers, Martinez, and Cora. Sojo himself scored on the play {{as a result of}} Langston's throwing error, and Langston was replaced by relief pitcher Bob Patterson.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{became a}} Christian {{at the age}} of 23. He has adopted a gesture of {{crossing}} his arms, with his left hand in his <b>glove</b> <b>and</b> his right hand underneath pointing with the index finger while looking at the sky, which both honors The Holy Trinity as well as his late father who died of cancer when Wilson was 17. He performs it when he records a save or closes out a game.|$|E

5|$|Sounds {{right fielder}} Caleb Gindl became the third player in team history to hit for the cycle when he {{accomplished}} the feat on July 10, 2011. Center fielder Logan Schafer garnered national media attention when he initiated a triple play on August 20, 2011, against the Omaha Storm Chasers. What made the rare occurrence even more unusual {{is that the}} ball first bounced off Schafer's <b>glove</b> <b>and</b> head before landing in his glove for the first out. He then returned {{the ball to the}} infield where second baseman Eric Farris and first baseman Mat Gamel completed the triple play by stepping on their respective bases. With Money at the helm, Nashville ended the year with a 71–73 record, placing third in their division.|$|E
5|$|At the Acme factory, Doom {{reveals his}} plot to destroy Toontown {{with a giant}} machine loaded with dip to build a freeway, the only way past Toontown since Cloverleaf has bought out Los Angeles' tram system. Roger unsuccessfully {{attempts}} to save Jessica, and the couple is tied onto a hook {{in front of the}} machine's hose. Valiant then performs a comedic vaudeville act, causing the weasels to die of laughter; Valiant kicks their leader, Smart Ass, into the machine's Dip vat, killing him instantly. Valiant then fights Doom, who is eventually flattened by a steamroller, but survives. Eddie is shocked when Doom reveals that he is the toon who killed Teddy. Valiant uses a toon mallet with a spring-loaded boxing <b>glove</b> <b>and</b> fires it at a switch that causes the machine to empty its dip onto Doom, dissolving him.|$|E
5|$|Many {{players with}} both teams won awards for their {{performances}} during the 2009 season. Teixeira and Jeter each won a Gold <b>Glove</b> <b>and</b> Silver Slugger Award; Jimmy Rollins and Shane Victorino won Gold Gloves, as well; and Chase Utley won a Silver Slugger Award. Rivera {{was named the}} 2009 DHL Delivery Man of the Year, as well as Sporting News Pro Athlete of the Year.

5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) is {{depressed}} {{because it}} is the first Valentine's Day since he and Holly broke up. Michael donates blood at a mobile blood drive being held in the business park's parking lot and has a nice conversation with a female donor (Kathryn Aselton) sitting next to him. When they both finish at the same time, Michael passes out because he did not eat much before giving blood, and when he wakes up she is gone. A disappointed Michael finds a glove he assumes she left behind and takes it, hoping she will come back for it. When Michael goes back into the office, he decides to gather all the single employees into the conference room to discuss their own personal romantic dilemmas. After becoming further depressed by their sad dating stories, Michael decides to try lifting their spirits by holding a singles mixer. He puts up flyers which also advertise the finding of a missing <b>glove,</b> <b>and</b> Michael hopes his mystery woman will come to the party as a result.|$|E
5|$|The {{action is}} {{compressed}} and truncated, beginning in medias res with Pandarus already working for Troilus and praising his virtues to Cressida over {{those of the}} other knights they see returning from battle, but comically mistaking him for Deiphobus. The Trojan lovers are together only one night before the hostage exchange takes place. They exchange a <b>glove</b> <b>and</b> a sleeve as love tokens, but the next night Ulysses takes Troilus to Calchas' tent, significantly near Menelaus' tent. There they witness Diomedes successfully seducing Cressida after taking Troilus' sleeve from her. The young Trojan struggles with what his eyes and ears tell him, wishing not to believe it. Having previously considered abandoning the senselessness of war in favour of his role of lover and having then sought to reconcile love and knightly conduct, he is now left with war as his only role.|$|E

25|$|Screenwriters and {{directors}} use {{the image of}} a man or woman slipping on a pair of leather gloves to indicate knowledge that a crime is happening.

25|$|Until 2003, {{reserves}} and pitchers were {{chosen by the}} manager. Player voting was re-introduced in 2003 after the managers were criticized for picking players from their own team over more deserving players from other teams. This was particularly evident in 2002, when National League manager Bob Brenly selected his own catcher, Damian Miller, over the more deserving Paul Lo Duca; while American League manager Joe Torre selected his own third baseman, Robin Ventura, over the Oakland Athletics' Gold <b>Glove</b> <b>and</b> Silver Slugger-winning third baseman Eric Chavez.|$|E
