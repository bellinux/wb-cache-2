2500|$|Ionization smoke {{detectors}} were first {{sold in the}} United States in 1951; they were used only in major commercial and industrial facilities {{in the next several}} years due to their large size and cost. In 1955 simple home [...] "fire detectors" [...] for homes were developed, detecting high temperatures. The United States Atomic Energy Commission (USAEC) granted the first license to distribute {{smoke detectors}} using radioactive material in 1963. The first low-cost smoke detector for domestic use was developed by Duane D. Pearsall in 1965, an individual replaceable battery-powered unit that could be easily installed. The [...] "SmokeGard 700" [...] was a beehive-shaped, strong fire-resistant steel unit. The company began mass-producing these units in 1975. Studies in the 1960s determined that smoke detectors respond to fires much faster than <b>heat</b> <b>detectors.</b>|$|E

50|$|Each type of <b>heat</b> <b>detector</b> has its advantages, and it {{cannot be}} said that one type of <b>heat</b> <b>detector</b> should always be used instead of another. If one were to place a {{rate-of-rise}} <b>heat</b> <b>detector</b> above a large, closed oven, then every time the door is opened a nuisance alarm could be generated due to the sudden heat transient. In this circumstance the fixed threshold detector would probably be best. If a room filled with highly combustible materials is protected with a fixed <b>heat</b> <b>detector,</b> then a fast-flaming fire could exceed the alarm threshold due to thermal lag. In that case the rate-of-rise <b>heat</b> <b>detector</b> may be preferred.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the smoke {{transport}} lag time at the early stage of fires in long-narrow spaces, which {{is defined as the}} time from fire onset to the time when smoke reaches a given position on the ceiling. For a <b>heat</b> <b>detector</b> at a specific location on the ceiling, the smoke transport lag time {{is a part of the}} response time of the <b>heat</b> <b>detector.</b> Especially when the heat release rate is relatively small at the early stage of fires, the smoke transport lag time will be very long, which will hence lead to the increase of <b>heat</b> <b>detector</b> response time. It is clear that the prediction of smoke transport lag time is critical to the activation time of the <b>heat</b> <b>detector.</b> However, previous studies have much focused on fire characteristics in long-narrow spaces, leaving very few on the transport time lag. Therefore, in this study, a theoretical model regarding smoke transport time lag was developed for both steady and time-dependent fires based on the weak-plume theory. This model was validated by a series of reduced-scale experiments. It can be concluded from comparison that the predictions of this model agree reasonably well with the corresponding experimental results. Using the proposed method, the dimensionless equations of smoke transport time lag, velocity and temperature considering the smoke lag effect in a long-narrow space for time-squared fires were also theoretically deduced. Additionally, to further determine the applicability of &# 039;Quasi-steady&# 039; state assumption for time-squared fires, a calculation method regarding the critical time was also developed. The outcomes from this study will be beneficial to the development of fire detection model in long-narrow spaces...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFire {{detector}} {{plays an}} important role in ship fire safety system. Usually, there are two types of fire detectors including fire smoke <b>detector</b> and <b>heat</b> <b>detector,</b> which are widely used in exit passageway, corridor, ladderway, and other long and narrow spaces in ship. Due to the smoke plume characteristics in these limited spaces are different to that of free plume in open place, the detection time calculating model of <b>heat</b> <b>detector</b> for these two different conditions are consequently different. This work is to develop a new detection time calculating model based on the fire plume rules including characteristics of temperature and velocity of fire smoke distributing in long and narrow spaces. Numeric method for calculating detection time is also presented. Finally, some calculations and analysis for a given fire scenario are performed. The numeric results are compared with that of the existing detection time calculating model based on free plume theory, which demonstrate the applicability of the model proposed in this article...|$|R

The temperature threshold for Painless activation is consistent with the temperatures that cause avoidance behaviors in vivo, indicating that Painless acts as a primary noxious <b>heat</b> <b>detector</b> in Drosophila.

50|$|A flame {{detector}} is a sensor designed {{to detect and}} respond to the presence of a flame or fire, allowing flame detection. Responses to a detected flame depend on the installation, but can include sounding an alarm, deactivating a fuel line (such as a propane or a natural gas line), and activating a fire suppression system. When used in applications such as industrial furnaces, their role is to provide confirmation that the furnace is properly lit; in these cases they take no direct action beyond notifying the operator or control system. A {{flame detector}} can often respond faster and more accurately than a smoke or <b>heat</b> <b>detector</b> due to the mechanisms it uses to detect the flame.|$|R

THz pulses can also be detected by bolometers, <b>heat</b> <b>detectors</b> cooled to liquid-helium temperatures.

Although an intruder alarm panel may also have these detectors connected, it may not meet all the local fire code requirements of a fire alarm system.|$|E
