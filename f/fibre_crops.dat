40|$|Abstract: Lignin and {{cellulose}} {{represent the}} two main components of plant secondary walls and the most abundant polymers on Earth. Quantitatively {{one of the principal}} products of the phenylpropanoid pathway, lignin confers high mechanical strength and hydrophobicity to plant walls, thus enabling erect growth and high-pressure water transport in the vessels. Lignin is characterized by a high natural heterogeneity in its composition and abundance in plant secondary cell walls, even in the different tissues of the same plant. A typical example is the stem of <b>fibre</b> <b>crops,</b> which shows a lignified core enveloped by a cellulosic, lignin-poor cortex. Despite the great value of <b>fibre</b> <b>crops</b> for humanity, however, still little is known on the mechanisms controlling their cell wall biogenesis, and particularly, what regulates their spatially-defined lignification pattern. Given the chemical complexity and the heterogeneous composition of <b>fibre</b> <b>crops</b> ’ secondary walls, only the use of multidisciplinary approaches can convey an integrated picture and provide exhaustive information covering different levels of biological complexity. The present review highlights the importance of combining high throughput-omics approaches to get a complete understanding of the factors regulating the lignification heterogeneity typical of <b>fibre</b> <b>crops...</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Fibre</b> <b>crops</b> are {{important}} natural resources, as they sustainably provide bast fibres, an economically-valuable raw material {{used in the}} textile and biocomposite sectors. Among <b>fibre</b> <b>crops,</b> textile hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is appreciated for its long and strong gelatinous bast fibres. The stem of <b>fibre</b> <b>crops</b> is a useful system for cell wall-oriented studies, because it shows a strong tissue polarity with a lignified inner core and a cellulosic hypolignified cortex, {{as well as a}} basipetal lignification gradient. Along the stem axis of <b>fibre</b> <b>crops,</b> a specific region, denoted snap point, marks the transition from elongation (above it) to fibre thickening (below it). After empirically determining the snap point by tilting the plant, we divided the stem segment containing it into three non-overlapping consecutive regions measuring 1 cm each, and carried out targeted RT-qPCR on cell wall-related genes separately, in outer and inner tissues. Different gene clusters can be observed, two of which are the major gene groups, i. e., one group with members expressed at higher levels in the inner tissues, and one group whose genes are more expressed in the cortex. The present results provide a molecular validation that the snap point is characterised by a gradient of events associated with the shift from fibre elongation to thickening...|$|E

40|$|Background: The fasciclin-like {{arabinogalactan}} proteins (FLAs) {{belong to}} the arabinogalactan protein (AGP) superfamily and are known to play different physiological roles in plants. This class of proteins was shown to participate in plant growth, development, defense against abiotic stresses and, notably, cell wall biosynthesis. Although some studies {{are available on the}} characterization of FLA genes from different species, both woody and herbaceous, no detailed information is available on the FLA family of textile hemp (Cannabis sativa L.), an economically important <b>fibre</b> <b>crop.</b> [br/] Results: By searching the Cannabis genome and EST databases, 23 CsaFLAs have been here identified which are divided into four phylogenetic groups. A real-time qPCR analysis performed on stem tissues (isolated bast fibres and shivs sampled at three heights), hypocotyls (6 - 9 - 12 - 15 - 17 - 20  days-old), whole seedlings, roots, leaves and female/male flowers of the monoecious fibre variety Santhica 27, indicates that the identified FLA genes are differentially expressed. Interestingly, some hemp FLAs are expressed during early phases of fibre growth (elongation), while others are more expressed in the middle and base of the stem and thus potentially involved in secondary cell wall formation (fibre thickening). The bioinformatic analysis of the promoter regions shows that the FLAs upregulated in the younger regions of the stem share a conserved motif related to flowering control and regulation of photoperiod perception. The promoters of the FLA genes expressed at higher levels in the older stem regions, instead, share a motif putatively recognized by MYB 3, a transcriptional repressor belonging to the MYB family subgroup S 4. [br/] Conclusions: These results point to the existence of a transcriptional network fine-tuning the expression of FLA genes in the older and younger regions of the stem, {{as well as in the}} bast fibres/shivs of textile hemp. In summary, our study paves the way for future analyses on the biological functions of FLAs in an industrially relevant <b>fibre</b> <b>crop...</b>|$|R

The use of kenaf core as animal bedding material is considered here as potential market outlet. An important aspect for this application is the moisture absorption capacity of the material. This paper describes evaluation of the water absorption capacity of different kenaf core fractions in comparison with other commercial animal bedding materials like straw and wood shavings.
