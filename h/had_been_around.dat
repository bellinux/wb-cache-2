5|$|The {{battle between}} Sydney and Kormoran {{is seen as}} controversial: the disbelief that a {{modified}} merchant ship could so successfully defeat a cruiser combined {{with the lack of}} Australian survivors led some to believe that the German account was false. Rumours that the battle was not what it seemed <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>around</b> since Sydney failed to reach Fremantle on schedule in 1941, but several historians (including Tom Frame and Wesley Olson) credit Michael Montgomery and his 1980 book Who Sank The Sydney? with igniting the controversy.|$|E
5|$|After {{an attack}} across the Ilebbe Creek by the 2/13th Infantry Battalion, which cost the Australians 80casualties on 1 October, the Japanese naval troops which were holding Finschhafen began to withdraw. On 2 October, the town {{fell to the}} Australians and the Japanese {{abandoned}} the Kakakog Ridge amidst heavy Australian air and artillery attacks. Once the 20th Brigade was established in Finschhafen, it linked up with the 22nd Infantry Battalion, a Militia infantry battalion. This unit had cleared the coastal area {{in the south of}} the peninsula, advancing from Lae over the mountains. Meanwhile, the Japanese that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>around</b> Finschhafen withdrew back into the mountains around Sattelberg. Allied air operations from the airfield at Finschhafen commenced on 4 October. The following day, the 2/17th Infantry Battalion was sent to Kumawa to follow up the retreating Japanese forces, and {{for the next couple of}} days minor clashes resulted before it established itself at Jivevaneng again on 7 October.|$|E

5|$|Harding {{retired in}} 1859 and was succeeded {{by his son}} William White Harding, who had become a partner three years earlier. William Harding changed {{the name of the}} {{newspaper}} to its current name, The Philadelphia Inquirer. Harding, in an attempt to increase circulation, cut the price of the paper, began delivery routes and had newsboys sell papers on the street. In 1859, circulation <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>around</b> 7,000; by 1863 it had increased to 70,000. Part of the increase was due to the interest in news during the American Civil War. Twenty-five to thirty thousand copies of The Inquirer were often distributed to Union soldiers during the war and several times the U.S. government asked The Philadelphia Inquirer to issue a special edition specifically for soldiers. The Philadelphia Inquirer supported the Union, but Harding wanted their coverage to remain neutral. Confederate generals often sought copies of the paper, believing that the newspaper's war coverage was accurate.|$|E
5|$|Harry K. Danziger succeeded Wax as rabbi in 1978. The {{son of a}} rabbi, Danziger was a {{graduate}} of the University of Cincinnati, and ordained by the HUC. He joined Temple Israel as assistant rabbi in 1964, but in 1969 moved to Monroe, Louisiana, to lead Congregation B'nai Israel. He was replaced first by Howard Schwartz, then by Richard Birnholz. Birnholz tendered his resignation in 1973, and Wax began to think of retirement. Danziger, then at Baltimore's Temple Oheb Shalom, was approached as Wax's successor, and returned to Temple Israel that year as associate rabbi. Synagogue membership <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>around</b> 1,350 families from the mid-1960s, but increased after the move to East Massey Road. By Wax's retirement it had reached around 1,500, and over half Memphis's 10,000 Jews were members of Temple Israel.|$|E
5|$|Released by Apogee on December 14, 1990, {{the trilogy}} of episodes was an {{immediate}} success; Apogee, whose monthly sales <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>around</b> US$7,000, made US$30,000 on Commander Keen alone {{in the first two}} weeks and US$60,000 per month by June, while the first royalty check convinced the development team, then known as Ideas from the Deep, to quit their jobs at Softdisk. The team founded id Software shortly thereafter and went on to produce another four episodes of the Commander Keen series over the next year. The trilogy was lauded by reviewers due to the graphical achievement and humorous style, and id Software went on to develop other successful games, including Wolfenstein 3D (1992) and Doom (1993). The Vorticons trilogy has been released as part of several collections by id and Apogee since its first release, and has been sold for modern computers through Steam since 2007.|$|E

5|$|The best-selling offshoots of {{industrial}} music have been industrial rock and metal; Ministry and Nine Inch Nails both recorded platinum-selling albums. Their success {{led to an}} increase in commercial success for some other industrial musicians; for example, the Nine Inch Nails remix album Further Down the Spiral, which included contributions from Foetus and Coil, was certified gold in 1996. The mid-1990s was a high point for industrial rock, when, in addition to bands that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>around</b> since the 1980s, newer bands such as Gravity Kills, whose self-titled debut sold almost half a million records, had some chart and radio success, and especially for industrial metal, with Marilyn Manson releasing multiple platinum selling albums.|$|E
5|$|The mid-1980s {{also saw}} Gospel music see its {{popularity}} peak. A {{new form of}} gospel had evolved, called Contemporary Christian music (CCM). CCM <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>around</b> since the late 1960s, and consisted of a pop/rock sound with slight religious lyrics. CCM had become the most popular form of gospel by the mid-1980s, especially with artists like Amy Grant, Michael W. Smith, and Kathy Troccoli. Amy Grant {{was the most popular}} CCM, and gospel, singer of the 1980s, and after experiencing unprecedented success in CCM, crossed over into mainstream pop in the 1980s and 1990s. Michael W. Smith also had considerable success in CCM before crossing over to a successful career in pop music as well. Grant would later produce CCM's first #1 pop hit ("Baby Baby"), and CCM's best-selling album (Heart In Motion).|$|E
5|$|The Abir Company entered {{liquidation}} in 1898 as a {{means of}} tax avoidance and to escape Belgian business regulations. It was immediately refounded in the Congo Free State as the Abir Congo Company. The name was no longer an acronym of Anglo-Belgian India Rubber and was instead a name in its own right. This change was because the company was no longer supported by British investment, partly because Colonel North had died and his heirs had sold their shares. The new company had a simpler shares system with just 2,000 shares (of 14,300 fr value each) divided between investors. The Free State held 1,000 of these shares. As Abir was now tax resident in the Congo the Free State received 2% of their profits through corporation tax, in addition to the 0.5 fr per kilogram export tax. All initial capital investments had been amortised by 1899 along with material expenses in Africa and property and equipment expenses in Antwerp. In 1900 Abir reached the boundaries of its concession which covered eight million hectares. The next three years were spent filling gaps between existing posts and by 1903 Abir controlled 49 posts, managed by 58 agents. 1900 was Abir's most profitable year and the Congo Free State's shares and taxes provided 2,567,880.50 fr of revenue for the state, 10% of that year's total. The share dividend in 1900 was 2,100 fr, in the early 1890s it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>around</b> 2 fr per share.|$|E

5|$|There was {{a gradual}} {{reduction}} in the number of locations allowed to mint coins in England; under HenryII, only 30 boroughs were still able to use their own moneyers, and the tightening of controls continued throughout the 13th century. By the reign of EdwardI there were only nine mints outside London and the king created a new official called the Master of the Mint to oversee these and the thirty furnaces operating in London to meet the demand for new coins. The amount of money in circulation hugely increased in this period; before the Norman invasion there <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>around</b> £50,000 in circulation as coin, but by 1311 this had risen to more than £1million. At any particular point in time, though, much of this currency might be being stored prior to being used to support military campaigns or to be sent overseas to meet payments, resulting in bursts of temporary deflation as coins ceased to circulate within the English economy. One physical consequence of the growth in the coinage was that coins had to be manufactured in large numbers, being moved in barrels and sacks to be stored in local treasuries for royal use as the king travelled.|$|E
5|$|Concepts {{for a third}} {{installment}} in the Parasite Eve {{video game}} series <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>around</b> for some time. As work was being finished on , Nomura voiced his wish {{to create a new}} game for the character Aya Brea, and this time it was taken up. Despite the story of Parasite Eve II not leaving many avenues for a sequel, the development team wanted to take advantage of advancing gaming technology and popularity by creating a mature gaming experience that would re-introduce Aya to players around the world. The main staff consisted of director Hajime Tabata, producer Yoshinori Kitase, creative producer and character designer Tetsuya Nomura, art director Isamu Kamikokuryo, scenario director Motomu Toriyama, and main writer Toshimitsu Takeuchi. Nomura requested Tabata as the two had worked well together on previous projects, and Nomura was busy with other projects despite his strong interest. The 3rd Birthday was originally announced in May 2007 as an episodic mobile game developed by Square Enix for Japan's FOMA mobile service. In 2008, during a special Square Enix event, the game was announced to have changed to a game for the PlayStation Portable. Part of the reason, as stated by Nomura, was that the desired level of realism was not possible on mobile phones. The game became exclusive to PSP as Tabata wanted to make full usage of the platform's hardware capabilities, along with it being a gaming platform available worldwide. Tabata and his team worked on The 3rd Birthday {{at the same time as}} fellow mobile-turned-PSP title Final Fantasy Type-0. Square Enix requested Tabata to concentrate on finishing The 3rd Birthday, leading to Type-0 almost being cancelled.|$|E
