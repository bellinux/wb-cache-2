40|$|Summary: A {{significant}} proportion of fathers living with their natural, adopted, step or foster children experience mental illness. Psychiatric illness among fathers can have a devastating impact on children’s wellbeing, and even milder forms of paternal mental illness can have serious developmental effects on children. While several pathways linking paternal mental illness with poor child outcomes have been identified, fathers’ <b>impaired</b> <b>parenting</b> is an important, potentially malleable factor. Clinicians can assist fathers with mental illness and their families by proactively inquiring about children and by exploring fathering-focused psychological support...|$|E

There were no direct risk effects for parental absence, although interactive effects between parental absence and parental age, child 2 ̆ 7 s age and income were found for the dimension of parental support. A small, but significant main effect of social support on parental support was noted. There was no evidence of a modifying, or buffering effect of social support on parenting practice or outcomes. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{multidisciplinary}} approach {{for the treatment}} of hearing impaired children presented the work group with several tasks: the group had to integrate different competences and techniques, to share common treatment goals, to manage relational dynamics with the children and their parents, and to explore the families' expectancies. These efforts may create stressful conditions for the work group and, consequently, might negatively affect the quality of the intervention to be carried out. Our aim was to illustrate a psychosocial analysis performed in a religious Institute for hearing impaired children, intended to break the pattern of the Institute's stalled productivity, to avoid inefficient and fragmented treatments, to prevent unelaborated relational dynamics among the staff members and between the staff and the children's families. By means of the Content Analysis of semi-structured interviews administered to staff-members and families we have analyzed the quality of the teamwork, the relational arrangements towards the families and local services (25 interviews with 5 staff members); the family-Institute relationship and the family's representation and satisfaction of the Institute (7 interviews with 13 hearing <b>impaired</b> <b>parents</b> and non-hearing <b>impaired</b> <b>parents).</b> The institute activity seemed to be more characterized by the maintenance of the relationship with the families per se, rather than oriented to productive goals. The non hearing <b>impaired</b> <b>parents</b> seemed to be more satisfied than the hearing-impaired parents, possibly because the former are more prepared to receive the Institute's help. The stalled productivity can only be overcome by the elaboration of those relational/emotional dynamics which prevent staff members and children's parents from focusing on productive goals. The staffmembers' training should be improved in order to develop specific competences, to perform an integrated, {{multidisciplinary approach}} in treatments, to negotiate with the families, and share the work program and treatment objectives with them...|$|R

Its aim is to describe the experiences of visually <b>impaired</b> <b>parents</b> with preparing {{for the arrival of}} a child, with parental role and with childcare during a preschool age. At the same time it aims to chart the social services available to this group and {{to determine the extent to}} which they actually use these services, or whether they are missing some services. Due to differences in the availability of services in Prague and in smaller towns, the whole diploma thesis is focused on the territory of Prague. The theoretical part describes a person with severe visual impairment, including its specifics in different areas of life. It also deals with possible different aspects of parenting for people with visual disabilities. It provides a description of compensatory aids and explains their important role in the lives of visually impaired people. Next it acquaints readers with the possibilities of financial support for visually <b>impaired</b> <b>parents</b> primarily by the state.

40|$|In my work, I {{deal with}} {{motherhood}} {{from the perspective}} of mothers with severe visual impairment. I focused especially on parenthood planning, on the period of pregnancy, childbirth and stay in the maternity ward and on the care for the child from birth to the age of three. I was interested to find out, whether visually impaired mothers encounter prejudices on part of the well-sighted people, whether they were worried that they could give birth to a handicapped child, what are the difficulties that severely visually impaired mothers come across most often in the individual period of development of the child, if and how education of children is different {{from the perspective of}} visually <b>impaired</b> <b>parents</b> from the perspective of well-sighted parents and also whether the child growing up in a family with at least one visually <b>impaired</b> <b>parent</b> is deprived of something or whether, on the contrary, this family situation has any advantages for such child. The objective of my diploma thesis is to map out various aspects of life of visually impaired mothers with small children in the greatest detail, directly {{from the point of view}} of those women. I attempted to achieve this objective by means of a qualitative method research, in particular in the form of a structured interview with six visually impaired mothers...|$|R
40|$|Maternal {{depression}} {{is associated with}} reduced academic attainment in children, however, {{it is not clear}} how this association comes about. Depressive symptoms are associated with impairment in social roles including parenting. Children’s self-control is an important contributor to academic attainment and is influenced by parenting. We therefore hypothesised that <b>impaired</b> <b>parenting</b> and children’s self-control may mediate links between maternal depression and children’s academic attainment. Data were from a brief longitudinal study (3 waves) of UK children aged 11 - 12 years and their mothers. Higher maternal depressive symptoms at baseline were associated with lower academic attainment in children assessed one year later. There was evidence to support an indirect effect of maternal depressive symptoms on children’s academic attainment through the mother-child and the father-child relationship which, in turn, reduced children’s self-control. These influences were independent of socio-economic deprivation. A direct effect of maternal depression on children’s academic attainment was also observed...|$|E
30|$|The aim {{of these}} {{intervention}} programs {{is to improve}} the parent–child relationship, increase parental responsiveness and reflectivity and parent–child emotional regulation and establish a secure attachment between the child and his or her parent/s. The intervention has a combination of interaction treatment were the parents are encouraged to become attentive to the child’s emotions and initiatives of contact and psychotherapy for the parent (Neander and Engstrom 2009). The parents who participate in such programs have all exhibited <b>impaired</b> <b>parenting</b> behavior, but as a group, they are heterogeneous. An earlier report from an infant and toddler program in Sweden has found that approximately half of the mothers who joined the program with their infants had been raised with substance-abusing parents. Furthermore, these women, compared with other parents reported more symptoms in their children, more severe problems between them and their children and greater difficulty including the father in the treatment (Tedgård 2008). It is important to identify parents with pronounced needs to provide targeted treatment.|$|E
30|$|In {{this study}} of mothers {{receiving}} treatment because of <b>impaired</b> <b>parenting</b> behavior, as indicated by their referral to a psychiatry clinic because of these difficulties, a substantial subgroup came from families with substance abuse. The findings suggest that even within a sample treated because of parenting malfunctions, women with substance abuse in their family of origin are a particularly vulnerable group of patients. The findings of a high reported prevalence of traumatic experiences {{and high levels of}} ADHD symptoms necessitate special treatment considerations. This knowledge should be important to health professionals, with the implication of screening for anxiety, depression and ADHD before the start of therapy. To prevent the intergenerational transmission of alcohol and drug abuse, it is important to identify parents with pronounced needs and to administer targeted treatment and support at primary health care centers and infant psychiatric clinics. Furthermore, this work suggests that it may be useful for prevention programs to identify at-risk women during pregnancy {{on the basis of a}} family history of substance abuse.|$|E
40|$|Research {{suggests}} that adult children {{are less likely}} to provide care to community-dwelling parents when beds in residential care settings are more widely available.

Drawing on data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) on 1, 214 impaired parent–child dyads from 12 countries, we find that adult children {{are less likely to}} provide care in countries where beds in residential care settings are more widely available because (a) parents’ care needs are less severe in such countries (out-selection hypothesis) and (b) adult children and <b>impaired</b> <b>parents</b> are less likely to share a household in such countries (in-selection hypothesis). Finally (c), after taking these two factors into account, adult children remain less likely to provide care in countries where beds in residential care settings are more widely available (diffusion of responsibility hypothesis).

40|$|Recent {{long-term}} care (LTC) {{reforms in the}} Netherlands are illustrative of those taking place in countries with a universalistic LTC model based on extensive provision of state-supported services. They entail a shift from de-familialisation, in which widely available state-supported LTC services relieve family members from the obligations to care for relatives in need, to supported familialism, in which family involvement in care-giving is fostered through support and recognition for families in keeping up their caring responsibilities. Using data from four waves of the Netherlands Kinship Panel Study (N = 2, 197), we show that between 2002 and 2014 the predicted probability that adult children provide occasional household support to <b>impaired</b> <b>parents</b> rose substantially. Daughters more often provided household support to parents than did sons, but no increase in the gender gap over time was found.

40|$|AIM: To {{identify}} nursing diagnoses {{and theoretical}} frameworks used in neonatal units through a literature review. METHOD: Cinahl, Medline and Lilacs, database {{were used to}} perform this study. The descriptors used were: "Nursing Diagnosis" AND "Models, Nursing" OR "Nursing Theory" AND "Infant" OR "Newborn". The search was limited to articles published from 2000 to November 2013. Studies were selected only if they were written in English, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian. RESULTS: In the literature review two taxonomies and six major theoretical frameworks were identified. The most frequently detected nursing diagnoses were: activity intolerance, impaired spontaneous ventilation, ineffective breathing pattern, risk for aspiration, delayed growth and development, Ineffective breastfeeding, Ineffective infant feeding pattern, hyperthermia / hypothermia, risk for infection, impaired tissue integrity, Interrupted family processes, risk for <b>impaired</b> <b>parenting,</b> risk for impaired attachment, interrupted family processes. Diagnoses applying to parents' psychosocial sphere were identified, enabling the newborn's integral evaluation, including the family.

40|$|Aim: The {{objective}} of the review was the analysis of Czech and foreign literature sources and professional periodicals to obtain a relevant comprehensive overview of validation studies of nursing diagnoses in neonatology. Design: Review. Methods: The selection criterion was studies concerning the validation of nursing diagnoses in neonatology. To obtain data from relevant sources, the licensed professional databases EBSCO, Web of Science and Scopus were utilized. The search criteria were: date of publication - unlimited; academic periodicals - full text; peer-reviewed periodicals; search language - English, Czech and Slovak. Results: A total of 788 studies were found. Only 5 studies were eligible for content analysis, dealing specifically with validation of nursing diagnoses in neonatology. The analysis of the retrieved studies suggests that authors are most often concerned with identifying the defining characteristics of nursing diagnoses applicable to both the mother (parents) and the newborn. The diagnoses were validated in the domains Role Relationship; Coping/Stress tolerance; Activity/Rest, and Elimination and Exchange. Diagnoses represented were {{from the field of}} dysfunctional physical needs as well as the field of psychosocial and spiritual needs. The diagnoses were as follows: Parental role conflict (00064); <b>Impaired</b> <b>parenting</b> (00056); Grieving (00136); Ineffective breathing pattern (00032); Impaired gas exchange (00030); and Impaired spontaneous ventilation (00033).

40|$|This study applied theory {{from the}} general work and family {{literature}} to the dual roles of work and caregiving, {{in order to examine}} whether level of satisfaction and time involvement in each of these roles moderate the effects of stress in the other role on well-being. Respondents were 118 employed women who were providing care to an <b>impaired</b> <b>parent</b> or parent-in-law. As predicted, greater time involvement in work was found to buffer women from the negative effects of caregiving stress. Satisfaction with caregiving and satisfaction with work were directly associ-ated with better well-being, beyond the effects of stress in both roles. However, women who experienced high levels of caregiving stress and who were highly satisfied with work were especially vulnerable to depression. These find-ings illustrate the importance of examining the effects of caregiving stress on well-being in the context of work-related experiences. DATA from a national survey of informal caregiversindicate that adult daughters and daughters-in-law constitute an important group of family members to pro-vide care to impaired older adults (Stone, Cafferata, and Sangl, 1987). Many of these women have additional family responsibilities, and almost half (44 %) are also employed (Stone, Cafferata, and Sangl, 1987). The continuing growt...|$|R

40|$|Objectives This study aims at {{examining}} {{policy and}} practice within the Swedish school setting pertaining to children of substance abusing parents/caregivers. Methods A cross-sectional survey, involving {{a representative sample of}} randomized schools (nÂ =Â  443) throughout Sweden was conducted using a self-completed questionnaire. Descriptive analysis was performed including bivariate analysis combined with logistic regression modeling to examine possible correlates between variables. Results The response rate was 66 %, and participants reported that 37 % had been trained in issues related to children of substance abusing parents, 33 % of the schools had a policy document, and 73 % of the schools had identified students with this complex of problems. Whether or not schools identify these students depends upon the occurrence of schools being "compulsory" or "upper secondary", "public" or "independent", the "school size", and respondents' participation in further training, which in turn is associated with the presence of a policy document. Conclusions It appears as if a policy document does not directly predict whether schools identify students having substance abusing parents. However, it does influence whether respondents have participated in further training, which subsequently predicts the identification of students having substance abusing parents.

Child- and parent-rated QOL was evaluated with the Child Quality of life Questionnaire of The Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research Academical Medical Centre (TNO-AZL). PA was assessed by the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) providing parental reports of a child's behaviour. In patients' self-ratings, the QOL dimension physical complaints (P < 0. 0005) scored significantly better than that of healthy controls, whereas the dimension positive emotional functioning was impaired (P = 0. 02).

40|$|Children {{growing up}} in low-income {{families}} face many challenges that children from more advantaged families do not. These {{children are more likely}} to experience multiple family transitions, move frequently, and change schools. The schools they attend are less well funded, and the neighborhoods they live in are more disadvantaged. The parents of these children have fewer resources to invest in them and, as a consequence, their homes have fewer cognitively-stimulating materials, and their parents invest less in their education. The stress of living in poverty and struggling to meet daily needs can also <b>impair</b> <b>parenting.</b> Social and economic deprivation during childhood and adolescence can have a lasting effect on individuals, making it difficult for children who grow up in low-income families to escape poverty when they become adults. Because the negative effects of deprivation on human development tend to cumulate, individuals with greater exposure to poverty during childhood are likely to have more difficulty escaping poverty as adults. In this research brief, we examine patterns of exposure to poverty during childhood and the association between these patterns and poverty in early and middle adulthood. Data for this study come from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), which collects information on the social and economic status of PSID families and their offspring every year. We find that individuals who grow up in poor families {{are much more likely to}} be poor in early adulthood. Moreover, the chances of being poor in early adulthood increase sharply as the time spent living in poverty during childhood increases. At all levels of poverty during childhood, African-Americans are more likely than whites to be poor in early and middle adulthood...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{multidisciplinary}} approach {{for the treatment}} of hearing impaired children exposes the work group to several tasks: the group needs to integrate different competencies and techniques, to share common treatment goals, to manage the relational dynamics with the children and with their parents, to explore the families’ expectancies. These efforts can put the work group in stressful conditions and, consequently, can negatively affect the quality of the intervention to be carried out. Aim Our aim was to illustrate a psychosocial analysis performed in a religious Institute for hearing impaired children, aimed at breaking the stalled productivity of the Institute, at avoiding inefficient and fragmented treatments, at preventing unelaborated relational dynamics within the staff and between the staff and the children’s families. Methodology Through the Content Analysis of semi-structured interviews administered to staff-members and families we analyzed the quality of the teamwork, the relational arrangements towards the families and local services (25 interview with 5 staff members); the family-Institute relationship and the family’s representation and satisfaction of the Institute (7 interview with 13 hearing and hearing <b>impaired</b> <b>parents).</b> Results The institute action seems to be more characterized by the maintenance of the relationship with the families per se, than oriented to productive goals. The hearing parents seem to be more satisfied than the hearing-impaired parents, possibly because the first are more prepared to receive the Institute's help. Conclusions The stalled productivity can be overcome only with the elaboration of those relational/emotional dynamics which prevent staff members and children’s parents from focusing on productive goals. The staff-members’ training should be improved in order to develop specific competencies to perform an integrated, {{multidisciplinary approach}} in treatments, to negotiate with the families, and share with them, work program and objectives of the treatment...|$|R
40|$|Families {{remain the}} most common source of {{assistance}} for older adults with physical and/or cognitive limitations (National Alliance for Caregiving and the American Association of Retired Persons, 1997; Schulz & Martire, 2004). A recent national phone survey found that nearly one in four US households included at least one self-identified caregiver who gave unpaid assistance to an impaired or physically frail relative {{over the age of}} 50 (NAC/AARP, 1997). The term “caregiving ” encompasses a wide range of activities, from management of medications and appointments to bathing, dressing, and toileting the individual. Typically, tasks change over time as the conditions in question either become more stable, deteriorate, or in some instances, improve. Family and friends often experience considerable stress when trying to provide extensive caregiving in addition to the other demands of their everyday lives – they are {{often referred to as the}} “sandwich generation ” since many are caught in the middle between employment and the responsibilities of caring for their husbands and children (and perhaps grand-children), as well as the responsibilities of caring for an <b>impaired</b> <b>parent</b> or parent-in-law. Spouses also experience considerable distress, typically focusing on their sense of loss as changes occur in the marital relationship (Davidson, 2006). Although it is true that caregiving can occur in the context of any significant physical and/or emotional disorder, most of the intervention research has been conducted with relatives of older adults with Alzheimer’s disease or another form of dementia. In addition, studies have found that these dementia family caregivers are generally more distressed than caregivers of physically impaired elders (Ory, Yee, Tennstedt, & Schulz, 2000).

However, these changes also put females {{at risk for}} postpartum depression and psychosis, which <b>impairs</b> <b>parenting</b> abilities and adversely affects children. Thus, changes in expression and interactions in a core subset of genes may be critical for emergence of a healthy maternal phenotype, but inappropriate changes of the same genes could put women at risk for postpartum disorders. This study evaluated microarray gene expression changes in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a region implicated in both maternal behavior and psychiatric disorders. Postpartum mice were compared to virgin controls housed with females and isolated for identical durations. Using the Modular Single-set Enrichment Test (MSET), {{we found that the}} genetic landscape of maternal mPFC bears statistical similarity to gene databases associated with schizophrenia (5 of 5 sets) and bipolar disorder (BPD, 3 of 3 sets). In contrast to previous studies of maternal lateral septum and medial preoptic area, enrichment of autism and depression-linked genes was not significant (2 of 9 sets, 0 of 4 sets). Among genes linked to multiple disorders were fatty acid binding protein 7 (Fabp 7), glutamate metabotropic receptor 3 (Grm 3), platelet derived growth factor, beta polypeptide (Pdgfrb), and nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 (Nr 1 d 1). RT-qPCR confirmed these gene changes as well as FMS-like tyrosine kinase 1 (Flt 1) and proenkephalin (Penk). Systems-level methods revealed involvement of developmental gene networks in establishing the maternal phenotype and indirectly suggested a role for numerous microRNAs and transcription factors in mediating expression changes. Together, this study suggests that a subset of genes involved in shaping the healthy maternal brain may also be dysregulated in mental health disorders and put females at risk for postpartum psychosis with aspects of schizophrenia and BPD...|$|R

However, with respect to the German health care environment, the study Crime and violence in older people's lives has been able to show that such events are not confined to isolated incidents. This thesis examines crucial aspects of this critical point in question which have so far remained unpublished. At the core of the analysis are adult children who take care of their physically <b>impaired</b> elderly <b>parents.</b> Regarding the empirical methods utilized in the analysis, both a quantitative questionnaire study and a qualitative interview study are implemented.

40|$|Youth {{anxiety is}} highly prevalent, distressing, and <b>impairing.</b> <b>Parenting</b> behaviors, {{including}} high control (psychological and behavioral) and low acceptance, have been implicated as {{risk factors for}} the development and maintenance of youth anxiety. Little is known about parenting and anxiety in Latino families. Given cultural differences in family orientation, it is plausible that the influence of parenting behaviors on youth mental health functioning may be culture-specific. The goal of this dissertation was to illuminate psychosocial processes that may serve to transmit anxiety from mother to child and to assess the potential of nonequivalent pathways in non-Hispanic White (NHW) and Latino (LA) youths. Three broad questions were probed : (1) Do parenting behaviors differ between anxious NHW and LA mothers? (2) Are parenting behaviors of anxious mothers associated with youth anxiety, depression, or somatic symptoms? (3) Does the influence of maternal behaviors on youth internalizing symptoms vary by ethnicity? To evaluate these questions, this dissertation examined youth report on three dimensions of maternal parenting behaviors (psychological control [PC], firm control [FC], and acceptance [AC]) and their association to youth internalizing symptoms in the children (ages 7 to 15) of clinically anxious NHW and LA mothers (N = 28 dyads; 17 NHW and 11 LA). In this sample, LA mothers were rated by their children as higher in PC. Significant group differences in maternal FC and AC did not emerge. Across groups, increased PC was associated with decreased anxiety per parent and youth reports, and decreased AC was associated with increased somatic and depressive symptoms by some reports. The associations between PC and AC and youth internalizing symptoms were moderated by ethnicity. Specifically, a) maternal PC was positively associated with youth-reported somatic symptoms for LA, but not NHW youths, b) AC was negatively associated with parent-reported youth anxiety symptoms in NHW, but not LA, youths, and (c) AC was negatively associated with youth-reported depressive symptoms for NHW, but not LA, youths. Broadly, results suggests that, as predicted, ethnic groups differ in parenting strategies {{and the influence of}} parenting behaviors on youth emotional functioning may vary by cultural context.

40|$|It is well {{documented}} that parent psychopathology {{is one of the}} strongest predictors of poor parenting. Theory and recent research suggests that the mechanism through which psychopathology <b>impairs</b> <b>parenting</b> may involve parental coping style acting as a mediator. The present study examined the relation between parent psychopathology, coping styles, and parents 2 ̆ 7 reports and observations of their discipline in 46 mothers and 27 fathers who participated in a parent training program for parents of children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Psychopathology included measures of depression, alcohol use, and adult ADHD symptomatology. For mothers, greater report of psychopathology was related to greater use of lax discipline, more observed consequences and praising/positive behavior, and to some degree more maladaptive coping. Higher levels of psychopathology were related to less use of adaptive coping styles for mothers. For fathers, greater report of psychopathology was related to greater use of lax and overreactive discipline, more observed arguing, and more avoidant-focused coping. Higher levels of psychopathology were related to less use of problem and emotion-focused coping for fathers. Furthermore, several non-linear relations emerged such that mothers who reported moderate levels of inattention and impulsivity engaged in more coercive parenting (e. g., arguing, repetition) and reported more problem-focused coping than mothers with either high or low levels of ADHD symptomatology. For fathers, moderate levels of depression were associated with the least amount of lax parenting and arguing. In addition, avoidant-focused coping was found to partially mediate the relation between mothers 2 ̆ 7 reports of depression and lax discipline and problem-focused coping was found to partially mediate the relation between fathers 2 ̆ 7 reports of impulsivity and lax discipline. However, further examination indicated that neither mediator created a difference that was significantly different from zero. It appears that screening for psychopathology and coping style prior to parents 2 ̆ 7 participation in training programs may help identify those parents who are at risk for engaging in more coercive parenting behavior and who may need more specialized, individualized treatment. Future studies employing larger samples, diagnostic interviews combined with self-report measures, and more structured observational data collection may provide better results, especially for mediational analyses. ...|$|R

40|$|Syfte: Syftet med denna studie var att beskriva hur mammor med synnedsättning och barn i åldern 0 - 16 år upplever sin psykosociala hälsa samt hur de hanterar sin situation. Metod: En deskriptiv studie med en kvalitativ ansats. Data analyserades med kvalitativ innehållsanalys enligt Graneheim och Lundman. Totalt analyserades intervjuer med åtta informanter. Resultat: Analysen resulterade i fem kategorier och 20 subkategorier: Att vara förälder med synnedsättning, att som synskadad möta sin omgivning, att få stöd, att hantera vardagen, att fysiskt och psykiskt påverkas av sin situation.   Resultaten visade att mammor med synnedsättning med barn i åldern 0 - 16 år utsattes för ökad psykosocialt stress. De höga krav de själva ställde på sig, den tid och energi som synnedsättningen tog i anspråk samt genom att de valde att inte berätta för sin omgivning att de hade en synnedsättning ansågs vara en del av förklaringen. Resultaten visade även att mammor med synnedsättning upplevde att de för det mesta blev bra bemötta samt att det sociala nätverket var viktigt för att få vardagen att gå ihop. Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} how visually impaired mothers with children aged 0 - 16 years experienced their psychosocial health and how they handle their situation. Method: A descriptive qualitative interview study.   Data analysis was performed by qualitative content analysis according to Graneheim och Lundman. A total of eight interviews were analysed. Results: The analysis yielded five categories containing a total of 20 sub-categories: to be a visually <b>impaired</b> <b>parent,</b> to encounter your environment, to get support, to handle everyday life, to be psychologically and physically affected by the situation. The study concludes that visually impaired mothers with children aged 0 - 16 years were more prone to psychosocial stress. This, according to the results, is due to the high demands they have on themselves, the time and energy everything takes when you are visually impaired and by choosing to not tell people around you about your visual impairment. The results also show that visually impaired mothers mostly experience positive attitudes and that the individual social network is important in order to make ends meet in everyday life. ...|$|R

Hearing <b>parents</b> often have major difficulties in communicating with their child when it is deaf or hearing impaired. These difficulties often lead to issues in the language development of the child. In this research we investigate the feasibility of a serious game for involving parents in the language development of their deaf or hearing impaired child by using sign language together in a fun and engaging way. From the feasibility analysis we find that such a serious game is feasible and could help deaf and hearing impaired children to improve their language development...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationships between life stressors (acute stress, chronic stress, and parental stress) and maternal depression {{as they relate to}} parenting self-efficacy among economically disadvantaged Korean women. The present investigation was {{based on the premise that}} parenting behavior develops as the result of multiple factors, including stressors, which combine to produce a final effect. The family stress model was expanded to include an examination of socio-environmental stresses as factors that might <b>impair</b> <b>parenting</b> through negative effects on maternal psychological functioning. In addition, parental stress was added as a stressor contributing to parenting quality. The study also investigated the effects of maternal depression on parenting efficacy as a predictor and mediator. The study aimed to assess: (a) the relationship between mothers' stressors (acute, chronic, and parental stress) and parenting self-efficacy while controlling for income, mother's education, mother's job status and total support; (b) the relationships between mothers' stressors and maternal depression; (c) the relationship between maternal depression and parenting self-efficacy; and (d) a mediating effect of maternal depression on the relationship between mothers' stressors and parenting self-efficacy. The study design was cross-sectional, and employed a convenience sampling method. The study participants were Korean mothers of children ages 3 - 5 in 12 daycare centers in Seoul, Korea. A total of 429 individuals participated in this study and data on 408 cases were analyzed. The results showed that socio-environmental stress and parental stress could result in depression and a low level of parenting self-efficacy among Korean mothers. Although income was an important variable, chronic stress and parental stress were found to be even more influential variables on maternal depression and parenting self-efficacy. This study found that the lower the income, the more vulnerable the mother was to stress, and it also showed that chronic stressors had more influence on maternal depression for low-income mothers than for middle-class mothers. This study showed that the mental health of low-income mothers mediated the relationship between chronic stress and parenting. To maximize effective parenting under high-stress conditions, mothers need to first protect their own psychological well-being against environmental contexts. For the welfare of the children, attention must be shown to the mental health of mothers and their welfare. Policy development and management for these issues are desperately needed in Korea...|$|R
