25|$|The only {{practical}} way to capture most of the fusion energy is to trap the neutrons inside a massive bottle of heavy material such as lead, uranium, or plutonium. If the 14 MeV neutron is captured by uranium (of either isotope; 14 MeV is high enough to fission both 235U and 238U) or plutonium, the result is fission {{and the release of}} 180 MeV of <b>fission</b> <b>energy,</b> multiplying the energy output tenfold.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} is focused on {{evaluating}} higher actinides beyond uranium {{that are capable of}} supporting power and propulsion requirements in robotic deep space and interstellar exploration. The central technology in this thesis is based on utilizing advanced actinides for direct <b>fission</b> fragment <b>energy</b> conversion coupled with magnetic collimation. Critical fission configurations are explored which are based on <b>fission</b> fragment <b>energy</b> conversion utilizing a nano-scale layer of the metastable isotope 242 mAm coated on carbon fibers. A 3 -D computational model of the reactor core is developed and neutron properties are presented. Fission neutron yield, exceptionally high thermal fission cross sections, high <b>fission</b> fragment kinetic <b>energy</b> and relatively low radiological emission properties are identified as promising features of 242 mAm as a fission fragment source.

25|$|When a uranium nucleus fissions {{into two}} {{daughter}} nuclei fragments, about 0.1 {{percent of the}} mass of the uranium nucleus appears as the <b>fission</b> <b>energy</b> of ~200MeV. For uranium-235 (total mean <b>fission</b> <b>energy</b> 202.5MeV), typically ~169MeV appears as the kinetic energy of the daughter nuclei, which fly apart at about 3% of the speed of light, due to Coulomb repulsion. Also, an average of 2.5neutrons are emitted, with a mean kinetic energy per neutron of ~2MeV (total of 4.8MeV). The fission reaction also releases ~7MeV in prompt gamma ray photons. The latter figure means that a nuclear fission explosion or criticality accident emits about 3.5% of its energy as gamma rays, less than 2.5% of its energy as fast neutrons (total of both types of radiation ~ 6%), and the rest as kinetic energy of fission fragments (this appears almost immediately when the fragments impact surrounding matter, as simple heat). In an atomic bomb, this heat may serve to raise the temperature of the bomb core to 100million kelvin and cause secondary emission of soft X-rays, which convert some of this energy to ionizing radiation. However, in nuclear reactors, the fission fragment kinetic energy remains as low-temperature heat, which itself causes little or no ionization.|$|E
25|$|Boosted fission weapons {{improve on}} the {{implosion}} design. The {{high pressure and temperature}} environment {{at the center}} of an exploding fission weapon compresses and heats a mixture of tritium and deuterium gas (heavy isotopes of hydrogen). The hydrogen fuses to form helium and free neutrons. The energy release from this fusion reaction is relatively negligible, but each neutron starts a new fission chain reaction, speeding up the fission and greatly reducing the amount of fissile material that would otherwise be wasted when expansion of the fissile material stops the chain reaction. Boosting can more than double the weapon's <b>fission</b> <b>energy</b> release.|$|E
25|$|Hybrid {{nuclear power}} is a {{proposed}} means of generating power by use {{of a combination of}} nuclear fusion and fission processes. The concept dates to the 1950s, and was briefly advocated by Hans Bethe during the 1970s, but largely remained unexplored until a revival of interest in 2009, due to delays in the realization of pure fusion. When a sustained nuclear fusion power plant is built, {{it has the potential to}} be capable of extracting all the <b>fission</b> <b>energy</b> that remains in spent fission fuel, reducing the volume of nuclear waste by orders of magnitude, and more importantly, eliminating all actinides present in the spent fuel, substances which cause security concerns.|$|E
50|$|The reactor, a BWR-6 type, uses {{slightly}} {{enriched uranium}} which <b>fissions</b> generate <b>energy</b> as heat. This heat raises {{the temperature of}} water used for cooling the core within the primary circuit, while it is transformed into steam which is used directly in the primary circuit to move the turbine coupled to the alternator.|$|R
50|$|Nuclear fusion {{produces}} {{energy by}} combining the very lightest elements into more tightly bound elements (such as hydrogen into helium), and nuclear <b>fission</b> produces <b>energy</b> by splitting the heaviest elements (such as uranium and plutonium) into more tightly bound elements (such as barium and krypton). Both processes produce energy, because middle-sized nuclei are the most tightly bound of all.|$|R
50|$|In 1979 Jane {{transferred}} to General Atomics {{with the title}} Senior Scientist. She {{spent the rest of}} her career at GA working on various <b>energy,</b> <b>fission</b> and fusion research contracts.|$|R
25|$|The total prompt <b>fission</b> <b>energy</b> {{amounts to}} about 181 MeV, or ~ 89% {{of the total}} energy which is {{eventually}} released by fission over time. The remaining ~ 11% is released in beta decays which have various half-lives, but begin as a process in the fission products immediately; and in delayed gamma emissions associated with these beta decays. For example, in uranium-235 this delayed energy is divided into about 6.5MeV in betas, 8.8MeV in antineutrinos (released {{at the same time}} as the betas), and finally, an additional 6.3MeV in delayed gamma emission from the excited beta-decay products (for a mean total of ~10 gamma ray emissions per fission, in all). Thus, about 6.5% of the total energy of fission is released some time after the event, as non-prompt or delayed ionizing radiation, and the delayed ionizing energy is about evenly divided between gamma and beta ray energy.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{inside the}} {{exploding}} bomb, the free neutrons released by fission carry away about 3% {{of the initial}} <b>fission</b> <b>energy.</b> Neutron kinetic energy adds to the blast energy of a bomb, but not as effectively as the energy from charged fragments, since neutrons are not slowed as quickly. The main contribution of fission neutrons to the bomb's power is the initiation of other fissions. Over half of the neutrons escape the bomb core, but the rest strike U-235 nuclei causing them to fission in an exponentially growing chain reaction (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.). Starting from one atom, the number of fissions can theoretically double a hundred times in a microsecond, which could consume all uranium or plutonium up to hundreds of tons by the hundredth link in the chain. In practice, bombs do not contain hundreds of tons of uranium or plutonium. Instead, typically (in a modern weapon) {{the core of a}} weapon contains only about 5 kilograms of plutonium, of which only 2 to 2.5 kilograms, representing 40 to 50 kilotons of energy, undergoes fission before the core blows itself apart.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} he moved his {{operation}} to the new secret town of Los Alamos, New Mexico, {{in the spring of}} 1943, the accumulated wisdom on nuclear weapon design consisted of five lectures by Berkeley professor Robert Serber, transcribed and distributed as the Los Alamos Primer. The Primer addressed <b>fission</b> <b>energy,</b> neutron production and capture, nuclear chain reactions, critical mass, tampers, predetonation, and three methods of assembling a bomb: gun assembly, implosion, and [...] "autocatalytic methods," [...] the one approach {{that turned out to be}} a dead end.|$|E
5000|$|About 81% of the U-236* nuclei are so {{energized}} {{that they}} undergo <b>fission,</b> releasing the <b>energy</b> as kinetic {{motion of the}} fission fragments, also emitting between one and five free neutrons.|$|R
50|$|Acenes, Pentacene and Tetracene in particular, are a {{prominent}} candidates for singlet <b>fission.</b> The <b>energy</b> of the triplet states {{are smaller than}} or equal to half of the singlet (S1) state energy, thus satisfying the requirement of S1 â‰¥ 2T1. Singlet fission in functionalized pentacene compounds has been observed experimentally. Intramolecular singlet fission in covalently linked pentacene and tetracene dimers has also been reported.|$|R
40|$|The {{experimentally}} determined exponential {{dependence of}} spontaneous fission rate on Z{sup 2 }/A {{has been used}} to derive an expression for the dependence of the <b>fission</b> activation <b>energy</b> on Z{sup 2 }/A. This expression {{has been used to}} calculate the activation energy for slow neutron induced fission and photofission. The correlation with the experimental data on these types of fission seems to be quite good...|$|R
2500|$|The {{remainder}} of the delayed energy (8.8 MeV/202.5 MeV= 4.3% of total <b>fission</b> <b>energy)</b> is emitted as antineutrinos, which as a practical matter, are not considered [...] "ionizing radiation." [...] The reason is that energy released as antineutrinos is not captured by the reactor material as heat, and escapes directly through all materials (including the Earth) at nearly the speed of light, and into interplanetary space (the amount absorbed is minuscule). Neutrino radiation is ordinarily not classed as ionizing radiation, because it is almost entirely not absorbed and therefore does not produce effects (although the very rare neutrino event is ionizing). Almost all {{of the rest of}} the radiation (6.5% delayed beta and gamma radiation) is eventually converted to heat in a reactor core or its shielding.|$|E
2500|$|Fissionable, non-fissile {{isotopes}} {{can be used}} as <b>fission</b> <b>energy</b> source {{even without}} a chain reaction. Bombarding 238U with fast neutrons induces fissions, releasing energy as long as the external neutron source is present. This is an important effect in all reactors where fast neutrons from the fissile isotope can cause the fission of nearby 238U nuclei, which means that some small part of the 238U is [...] "burned-up" [...] in all nuclear fuels, especially in fast breeder reactors that operate with higher-energy neutrons. That same fast-fission effect is used to augment the energy released by modern thermonuclear weapons, by jacketing the weapon with 238U to react with neutrons released by nuclear fusion {{at the center of the}} device. But the explosive effects of nuclear fission chain reactions can be reduced by using substances like moderators which slow down the speed of secondary neutrons.|$|E
2500|$|Nuclear {{reactors}} are {{the major}} source of human-generated neutrinos. The majority of energy in a nuclear reactor is generated by fission (the four main fissile isotopes in nuclear reactors are , , [...] and [...] ), but the resultant neutron-rich daughter nuclides are below the neutron drip line, and therefore rapidly undergo additional beta decays, each converting one neutron to a proton and releasing an electron antineutrino (...) [...] [...] Including these subsequent decays, the average nuclear fission releases about [...] of energy, of which roughly 95.5% is retained in the core as heat, and roughly 4.5% (or about [...] ) is radiated away as antineutrinos.

This is to say, [...] of <b>fission</b> <b>energy</b> is lost from this reactor and does not appear as heat available to run turbines, since antineutrinos penetrate all building materials practically without interaction.|$|E
50|$|The {{natural or}} primary energy sources are not {{included}} in the calculation of energy invested, only the human-applied sources.For example, in the case of biofuels the solar insolation driving photosynthesis is not included, and the energy used in the stellar synthesis of fissile elements is not included for nuclear <b>fission.</b> The <b>energy</b> returned includes only human usable energy and not wastes such as waste heat.|$|R
25|$|Uranium {{appears in}} nature {{primarily}} in two isotopes: uranium-238 and uranium-235. When {{the nucleus of}} uranium-235 absorbs a neutron, it undergoes nuclear <b>fission,</b> releasing <b>energy</b> and, on average, 2.5 neutrons. Because uranium-235 releases more neutrons than it absorbs, it can support a chain reaction and so is described as fissile. Uranium-238, on the other hand, is not fissile as it does not normally undergo fission when it absorbs a neutron.|$|R
25|$|Just as {{conventional}} power-stations generate electricity by harnessing the thermal energy released from burning fossil fuels, nuclear reactors convert the energy released by controlled nuclear <b>fission</b> into thermal <b>energy</b> for further conversion to mechanical or electrical forms.|$|R

The purchase, which included Fission's uranium deposit at Waterbury Lake Canada's Athabasca Basin, means Denison is quite possibly the leading uranium exploration company in the Basin.

40|$|International audienceFission yields are {{essential}} for nuclear reactor studies (decay heat, fuel inventoryâ€¦) and constitute {{also one of the}} main observables needed to improve our understanding of the fission process. The symmetric mass region is of particular interest due to various intriguing properties of the fission fragments already reported in the literature : inversion of the nuclear charge polarization, large width of the <b>fission</b> fragment kinetic <b>energy</b> distribution, strong change of the prompt neutron multiplicity, etc. Recently, measurements of fission yields and kinetic energy distributions in the symmetric mass region were achieved at the LOHENGRIN mass spectrometer of the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL). This experimental work is challenging due to the low counting rate and the appearance of contaminant masses, leading to pronounced components in the <b>fission</b> fragment kinetic <b>energy</b> distribution. Despite removing the undesirable contributions, the <b>fission</b> fragment kinetic <b>energy</b> distributions still show two components, indicating that the fission process could be modal.

40|$|Shell effects play a {{major role}} in fission. Mass-asymmetric fission {{observed}} in the spontaneous and low <b>energy</b> <b>fission</b> of actinide nuclei was explained by incorporating the fragment shell properties in liquid drop model. Asymmetric fission has also been observed in the low <b>energy</b> <b>fission</b> of neutron-deficient 180 Hg nuclei in recent Î²-delayed fission experiments. This low-energy Î²-delayed fission has been explained in terms of strong shell effects in pre-scission configurations associated with the system after capture. Calculations predicted asymmetric fission for heavier Hg isotopes as well, at compound nuclear excitation energy as high as 40 MeV.
