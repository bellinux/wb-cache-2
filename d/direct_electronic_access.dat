40|$|Medical {{documents}} {{provided to}} {{patients at the}} end of an epi-sode of care, such as discharge summaries and referral let-ters, serve as an important vehicle to convey critical infor-mation to patients and families. Increasingly, healthcare insti-tutions are also experimenting with granting patients <b>direct</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>access</b> to other types of clinical narratives that are not typically shared unless explicitly requested, such as pro-gress notes. While these efforts have great potential to im-prove information transparency, their value can be severely diminished if patients are unable to read and thus unable to properly interpret the medical documents shared to them. In this study, we approached the problem by contrasting the ‘readability ’ of two types of medical documents: referral let-ters vs. other genres of narrative clinician notes not explicitly intended for direct viewing by patients. To establish a baseline for comparison, we also computed readability scores of Med-linePlus articles—exemplars of fine patient education materi-als carefully crafted for lay audiences. We quantified docu-ment readability using four different measures. Differences in the results obtained through these measures are also dis-cussed...|$|E
40|$|Background: In Australia, {{rural and}} remote {{communities}} have {{high rates of}} diabetes-related death and hospitalisation. General practitioners (GPs) {{play a major role}} in diabetes detection and management. Education of GPs could optimise diabetes management and improve patient outcomes at a population level. The study aimed to describe the uptake of a continuing medical education intervention for rural GPs and its impact on the viability of a cluster randomised controlled trial of the effects of continuing medical education on whole-town diabetes monitoring and control. Method: Trial design: the cluster randomised controlled trial involved towns as the unit of allocation and analysis with outcomes assessed by de-identified pathology data (not reported here). The intervention programme consisted of an online active learning module, <b>direct</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>access</b> to specialist advice and performance feedback. Multiple rounds of invitation were used to engage GPs with the online intervention content. Evidence-based strategies (e. g. pre-notification, rewards, incentives) were incorporated into the invitations to enrol in the programme. Recruitment to the programme was electronically monitored through the hosting software package during the study intervention period. Results: Eleven matched pairs of towns were included in the study. There were 146 GPs in the 11 intervention towns, of whom 34 (23. 3 %) enrolled in the programme, and 8 (5. 5 %) completed the online learning module. No town had more than 10 % of the resident GPs complete the learning module. There were no contacts made by GPs regarding requests for specialist advice. Consequently, the trial was discontinued. Conclusion: There is an ongoing need to engage primary care physicians in improving diabetes monitoring and management in rural areas. Online training options, while notionally attractive and accessible, are not likely to have high levels of uptake, even when evidence-based recruitment strategies are implemented...|$|E
40|$|This is a pre-print of {{an article}} whose final and {{definitive}} form has been published in Acta Neurochirurgica © 2009 Springer; the original publication is available at: [URL] The BrainIT group works collaboratively on developing standards for collection and analyses of data from brain injured patients towards providing a more efficient infrastructure for assessing new health care technology. EC funding supported meetings over a year to discuss and define a core dataset to be collected with IT based methods from patients with traumatic brain injury. We now report {{on the results of}} a follow-up period of funding to test the feasibility for collection of the core dataset with IT based methods. METHODS: Over a three year period, data collection client and web-server based tools were developed and core data (grouped into 9 categories) were collected from 200 head-injured patients by local nursing staff. Data were uploaded by the BrainIT web and random samples of received data were selected automatically by computer for validation by data validation (DV) research nurse staff against gold standard sources held in the local centre. Validated data were compared with original data sent and percentage error rates calculated by data category. Feasibility was assessed in terms of the amount of missing data, accuracy of data collected and limitations reported by users of the IT methods. FINDINGS: Thirteen percent of data files required cleaning. Thirty “one-off” demographic and clinical data elements had significant amounts of missing data (> 15 %). Validation nurses conducted 19, 461 comparisons between uploaded database data with local data sources and error rates were generally {{less than or equal to}} 6 %, the exception being the surgery data class where an unacceptably high error rate was found. Nearly 10, 000 therapies were successfully recorded with start-times but approximately a third had inaccurate or missing end times which limits analyses assessing duration of therapy. Over 40, 000 events and procedures were recorded but events with long durations (such as transfers) were more likely to have “end-times” missed. CONCLUSIONS: The BrainIT core dataset is a rich dataset for hypothesis generation and post-hoc analyses provided studies avoid known limitations in the dataset. Limitations in the current IT based data collection tools have been identified and have been addressed. Future academic led multi-centre data collection projects must decrease validation costs and likely will require more <b>direct</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>access</b> to hospital based clinical data sources for both validation purposes and for reducing the research nurse time needed for double data entry. This type of infrastructure will foster remote monitoring of patient management and protocol adherence in future trials of patient management and monitoring. Open Acces...|$|E
