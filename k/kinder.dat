40|$|Natural <b>kinds</b> {{are often}} contrasted with other <b>kinds</b> of {{scientific}} <b>kinds,</b> especially functional <b>kinds,</b> {{because of a}} presumed categorical difference in explanatory value: natural <b>kinds</b> can ground explanations, while other <b>kinds</b> of <b>kinds</b> cannot. I argue against this view of natural <b>kinds</b> by examining {{a particular type of}} explanation – mechanistic explanations – and showing that functional <b>kinds</b> do the same work there as natural <b>kinds</b> are supposed to do in more standard scientific explanations. Breaking down the categorical distinction between natural <b>kinds</b> and other <b>kinds</b> of <b>kinds,</b> I argue, delivers two goods: It provides us with a view of natural kindhood that does justice to the epistemic roles of <b>kinds</b> in scientific explanations.

Lead mining began to decline from the mid-19th century, with the last major mine closing in 1939, though lead remains a by-product of fluorite, baryte and calcite mining. Not all mines were deep underground; Bell pits were a cheap and easy way at getting at an ore that lay close to the surface of flat land. A shaft was sunk into the ore and enlarged at the bottom for extraction. The pit was then enlarged further until it became unsafe or worked out, then another pit would be sunk adjacent to the existing one.|$|E
