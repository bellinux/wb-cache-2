Subsequently the discipline Public Administration emerged as a unique study drawing from many other existing social sciences, predominantly Political Science. Public administration developed and its dual meaning, that is, Public Administration and public administration, which referred to the discipline and activity respectively, were accepted. Terms that were to be associated with both the discipline and activity were administer, administration, administrator, bureaucracy, bureaucrats, efficiency, effectiveness, public interest, public welfare, to name but a few predominant ones. However, over time, these terms have become anathema to both the discipline and activity with the replacement of the concep...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: It is {{expected}} {{that over the next}} few years type approval legislation and public awareness will force vehicle manufacturers to identify recovery methods during the design process in order to achieve reuse and recycling targets. Current vehicle design in Malaysia does not sufficiently aid the economic recovery of parts and materials to reach these targets. Approach: This study aimed to provide a framework for automotive components to be designed for ease of recovery. Disassemblability concept evolved from the life cycle engineering concept in which design for disassembly is one of the strategies in reducing the impact of the product to the environment. Results: The proposed methodology that consisted of three distinct elements namely <b>implementing</b> <b>principles</b> and guidelines of design for disassembly into the design, generating optimum disassembly using genetic algorithm approach and evaluating disassemblability of end-of-life products will be discussed.

IT security and data privacy training are critical controls for safeguarding company information. Employees often dislike the training, however, which can cause a lack of attention to, and poor understanding of, training concepts leading to less effective internal control. To improve the training experience, companies are <b>implementing</b> <b>principles</b> of games in employee training modules, a practice known as gamification. Utilizing a laboratory experiment on data privacy training and a field study involving IT security training for employees of a bank, we test whether a training environment with basic gamification elements results in greater trainee satisfaction and knowledge acquisition than traditional, non-gamified training. We find basic gamification results in higher satisfaction levels in the lab and field, but only marginally significant improvements in learning. Furthermore, these learning improvements are quite small (e. g., 1 to 3 percent). Finally, we find that “gamers” (i. e., those who participate in gaming on their own time) gain more knowledge from gamified training than “non-gamers,” although gamers are less satisfied with gamified training...|$|E
