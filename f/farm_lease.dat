[...] Nationalists and Land Leaguers argued that packed pro-government juries had convicted and executed the wrong men, while their opponents argued that the victims' families had to have redress.

Curtin was a Catholic tenant farmer; after his burial his family were boycotted locally for naming his murderers to the police, and were therefore obliged to sell their <b>farm</b> <b>lease</b> and leave their home in April 1888. The bitterness and distrust engendered in the Land War, and the suffering on both sides, were emotive elements in the movement for Irish Home Rule and the eventual partition of Ireland.|$|E

An analysis of the <b>farm</b> <b>lease</b> legal regulations, of the policy with regard to farm structure and farm entry, and of the operating principles of the CAP, reveals the emergence of a capital rationality in contrast to the pre-existing patrimonial logic, accompanied by the submission of the firm to a patrimonial finality.

40|$|LINCOLN, Neb. 2 ̆ 6 Landowners and tenants face {{difficult}} leasing {{decisions for}} the year ahead, a University of Nebraska-Lincoln agricultural economist says. It will be especially challenging to determine a fair and reasonable leasing agreement for both parties, said Bruce Johnson, UNL agricultural economist. 2 ̆ 2 Production agriculture is already risky, but faced with the current financial crisis {{there seems to be}} little disagreement that we are, in the very least, staring into the face of a potentially long and deep global recession, 2 ̆ 2 Johnson said. In recent years, Nebraskans and others in the Midwest have enjoyed profitable times. In addition, thanks to the more conservative decisions of both lenders and borrowers, farmers are not experiencing the degree of economic hardship facing many other regions of the country, the Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources specialist said. 2 ̆ 2 Nevertheless, serious impacts on the U. S. agricultural sector are still being felt, 2 ̆ 2 he said. 2 ̆ 2 As seen by the recent down-turns in agricultural commodity prices, we in the nation 2 ̆ 7 s heartland are closely tied to the emerging realities of a global recession that could significantly curtail demand for both food and fuel. 2 ̆ 2 When it comes to farm leases, Johnson said both the tenant and landowner need to realize that risk exposure going into 2009 is greater than ever before. With a cash lease, the tenant carries the bulk of the risk, and the landowner must realize this risk is growing. 2 ̆ 2 Tenants can 2 ̆ 7 t simply continue to bid up cash rents {{in light of the fact}} that there is serious risk exposure on both the purchased-input side and the commodity price side, 2 ̆ 2 he said. The best advice, Johnson said, may be to leave 2009 cash rent rates at 2008 rates assuming those 2008 rates were set at reasonable and competitive levels for the local area. When one loads current conditions into the UNL <b>Farm</b> <b>Lease</b> Calculator, the results would suggest little economic justification for raising 2009 lease rates much above the 2008 levels.

40|$|The present Iowa {{farm price}} index {{has been in}} use since 1926. It is widely {{employed}} {{as a measure of}} the general level of Iowa farm prices and appears each month in the price barometer published in Agricultural Economic Facts 2. A few years ago Peck 3 developed a <b>farm</b> <b>lease,</b> known as the sliding scale lease, in which the rental payments are based on and vary with the changes in the index number. More recently, contracts covering land sales have been devised in which the interest payments and in some cases also the principal payments are based on this farm price index 4. The enactment of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, May, 1933, has occasioned much current interest in parity price which is now computed each month for Iowa and also appears in Agricultural Economic Facts. In the computation of a parity price for the state, it is necessary to have an index of Iowa farm prices.

40|$|The present Iowa laws {{pertaining}} to landlord-tenant relationships do {{not distinguish between}} urban and agricultural conditions, with only two exceptions: The agricultural landlord’s lien and the termination of indefinite agricultural leases. This lien applies to the total crop and to all personal property of the tenant, except to the property exempted from execution. In addition, leases usually contain a provision in which the tenant waives his exemption rights. In periods of excessive price decline or crop failure, and if production credit is sought by the tenant, the landlord’s lien may work serious hardship. As a possible corrective, placing of certain limitations on the landlord’s lien, and declaring invalid any waivers of exemption rights might be considered. An Iowa statute provides that any lease with a fixed date of termination shall expire without notice and that only 1 month’s notice is necessary to terminate an indefinite tenancy. The old common law rule provided for a 6 months’ period of notice for termination of leases without a definite expiration date. It was changed by legislation {{in order to accommodate}} urban tenants and landlords.

40|$|Farm tenancy in Iowa is a live {{question}} because already, {{a large percentage}} of the farms of the state are operated by tenants and because there has been a rapid increase in the number of farms rented from year to year. The opinion is quite generally held that one can tell a rented farm by its dilapidated buildings, poor crops and worn out land. It is also quite generally believed that there is something wrong with the existing system of. farm leases as a whole. The fact is that many of the best managed and most successful farms are operated by tenants and in general it may be stated that out of experience have come several methods of leasing which seem to provide for good farming and a fair division of returns between the land owner and tenant. These general facts were brought out in an investigation prompted by the general interest in farm tenancy and the rapid increase of rented farms operated by year to year tenants. Director C. F. Curtiss of the Iowa Agricultural Experiment station planned to undertake this investigation and secured the cooperation of the United States Department of Agriculture in an effort to get at the truth about farm tenancy and to determine what constitutes a satisfactory <b>farm</b> <b>lease.</b> In other words, the purpose of the investigation was to learn what the landlord and tenant each should furnish and what each should receive in a lease which calls for profitable farming and a fair division of the farm returns...|$|E
40|$|Tasmanian blue mussels (Mytilus planulatus) were cultured at four {{sites in}} the {{vicinity}} of an Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) farm in North West Bay, Tasmania. The main objective {{of the study was to}} evaluate the potential of integrating mussel and salmon culture within a common multi-species marine farm. Filter-feeding bivalves cultured near open fish cages might obtain additional food supplies directly from particulate wastes (excess fish feed and faeces) and indirectly from enhanced phytoplankton production stimulated by dissolved nutrient wastes. Potential benefits of such integration include enhanced bivalve growth, increased productivity of a coastal marine fish farm, and reduced fish farm waste loadings and their associated environmental impacts. Mussels were cultured for fourteen months, suspended from four longlines positioned at increasing distances (70, 100, 500 and 1200 meters) from the Aquatas Pty. Ltd. salmon farm in North West Bay. Mussels were monitored monthly for various growth and biochemical parameters including shell length, whole live weight, meat weights, total biomass, condition index, glycogen content, stable isotope ratios (δ 13 C and δ 15 N), reproductive development and survival. Water quality and environmental parameters at each longline site were monitored weekly over the same period. The performance of mussels grown within the fish <b>farm</b> <b>lease</b> (70 m and 100 m from the fish cages) was not appreciably different from that of mussels grown distant to the farm. Mussels spawned twice with no differences in biomass production among sites (P > 0. 05).
