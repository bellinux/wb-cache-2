5|$|British {{nationality}} law as it {{pertains to}} Hong Kong has been unusual ever since Hong Kong became a British colony in 1842. From <b>its</b> <b>beginning</b> as a sparsely populated trading port to its modern role as a cosmopolitan international financial centre of over seven million people, the territory has attracted refugees, immigrants and expatriates alike searching for a new life.|$|E
5|$|In 1753 the French began {{expanding}} their military control into the Ohio Country, a territory already {{claimed by the}} British colonies of Virginia and Pennsylvania. These competing claims led to {{a war in the}} colonies called the French and Indian War (1754–62) and contributed {{to the start of the}} global Seven Years' War (1756–63).

5|$|As Grameen {{bank has}} {{developed}} and expanded {{in the years}} since <b>its</b> <b>beginning,</b> it continues to operate on those same two principles. Today, Grameen bank still assumes that when individuals are provided credit, {{they will be able to}} initiate upward social mobility for themselves through entrepreneurial endeavours. As a result, Grameen differs from many other social justice efforts in that it does not include intensive rehabilitation training programs for the disadvantaged persons it serves. Instead, Grameen gives its borrowers freedom to pursue a better future using the skills they already possess in the best way they can with membership in a five-person support group being the only requirement.|$|E

5|$|As regards proportionality, the law {{states that}} a self-defense {{may not be}} manifestly disproportionate. It is evident, that for a self-defense to be successful, {{it has to be}} {{performed}} on a level exceeding the attack. Unlike in case of necessity, the consequence of necessary self-defense may be more serious than consequence of the attack. The defense may not be restricted to a passive one, it can also be active. It is not the outcome of the incident but the sequence of actions at <b>its</b> <b>beginning</b> which determines who is to be deemed the attacker, and who is the party attacked.|$|E
5|$|Beyoncé Knowles is {{not worried}} chasing fads, {{though she is}} well aware of them. Over the years, she has learned how to harness them so {{effortlessly}} that they seem like her ideas. Take the standout track on her new album, 4, 'I Miss You', a slow-burn jam of desire co-written by Odd Future-affiliated crooner Frank Ocean. In <b>its</b> <b>beginning</b> moments, the song draws on the sparse wave of recent music by British band The xx by using silence as a weapon, a notion that extends across the 12-song album.|$|E

Although the system was first developed for commercial use, the development of coherent units of measure made it particularly suitable for science and engineering.|$|E

The Petty Officers of this time did not have uniforms or a rank insignia. In 1841 a rate badge was assigned, consisting of a sleeve device displaying an eagle perched on an anchor. Rating marks did not appear until 1866.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{founding}} of Albany in 1624 as a trading post, shipping has been important to its growth and prosperity. Furs (especially beaver), timber, and farm produce were important exports while European people and goods were shipped in. The Dongan Charter, which established Albany as a city, made Albany the exclusive market town in the upper Hudson River Valley. From <b>its</b> <b>beginning,</b> the port consisted of hastily built docks built every spring and destroyed every winter by erosion, flooding, ice, and tidal action. Three city-owned docks were established in 1766, {{the northern and southern}} ones later being expanded into wharves.|$|E
5|$|The Don River valley, formed {{during the}} last ice age, has played an {{important}} role in the development of Toronto from <b>its</b> <b>beginning</b> as the Town of York. Using the power of the river, the first sawmill was erected at today's Todmorden Mills by 1795 and other industry was founded soon after, including a grist mill, paper mill and brewery by 1828. Railways were introduced into the valley after 1850 with the building of tracks into Toronto. By 1900, the Don River south of today's Bloor Street was straightened into a channel for boating purposes, with roadways and industry built on both banks.|$|E

The first women in the team participated at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montréal, and the delegation has included women ever since, peaking at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. The size of its summer Olympic team was largest between 1972 (16 athletes) and 1992 (25 athletes), and was at its all-time largest in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles when 29 athletes competed for the country.

5|$|On 15 June 1824 Heber {{set out on}} a tour of {{northern}} India, accompanied by his personal chaplain, Martin Stowe, and Daniel Corrie, the Archdeacon of Calcutta. Amelia remained in Calcutta; earlier in the year she had given birth to her third daughter, Harriet. The general plan was to travel by boat to the upper waters of the River Ganges, then overland into the foothills of the Himalayas before turning south and west, crossing Rajputana to reach Bombay. The journey was almost aborted near to <b>its</b> <b>beginning</b> when Stowe fell ill in Dacca and died there; after some hesitation, Heber decided that the tour should continue. Early in August the party reached Benares (now Varanasi), the largest of the cities in the Ganges plain, where Heber spent several weeks. It was a wholly Indian city without a European population, sacred to Hindus, Sikhs and Buddhists but with a well-established CMS school and a substantial Christian minority. Heber consecrated a new church, and when he conducted a Holy Communion service in both English and Hindustani, a large congregation of Christians and Hindus thronged the church.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{ran into}} unexpected difficulties, {{and did not}} achieve its objectives. The Soviet Union did not give explicit support to the operation, and the United States provided air and sea cover to Kuomintang supply ships up to within three miles of the Chinese coast. Kuomintang fighter jets shot down thirty-seven PRC fighters (while only losing three themselves), and Nationalist artillery and naval bombardments destroyed fourteen PRC ships. Peng had quietly opposed the operation since <b>its</b> <b>beginning,</b> and began to gradually end hostilities after the PLA encountered serious difficulties, announcing a series of intermittent ceasefires before eventually halting the campaign in late October. Su Yu was blamed for the disaster and replaced with another ally of Peng's, General Huang Kecheng. Peng's position was not directly affected, but his personal prestige suffered, and the practical effects of his efforts to modernize China's armed forces were called into question within the PLA. Su was accused of directing the aborted attack on Matzu and withdrawing troops from North Korea without authorization, and of secretly taking orders from the USSR. The conflict between Su and Peng lingered throughout Peng's life, and Su was not rehabilitated until after his death.|$|E
5|$|The {{documentary}} {{was inspired}} by Madonna's need to show her artistic side on the tour and her devotion towards the Jewish mysticism Kabbalah. Unlike her 1991 documentary , which portrayed Hollywood glamour, I'm Going to Tell You a Secret clarified from <b>its</b> <b>beginning</b> that {{it was about the}} singer's personal views on life and spirituality. Like Truth or Dare, the performance scenes were shot in color, {{while the rest of the}} film was in black-and-white. Besides Madonna, her dancers and her tour entourage, Åkerlund also shot her family, her working process and her day-to-day life. Madonna and her then-husband Guy Ritchie's local pub in Mayfair, London was used for some sequences. The film features appearances from Madonna's father, stepmother and filmmaker Michael Moore.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} definite {{reference to}} cricket is dated Monday, 17 January 1597 (i.e., a Julian date which is 1598 by modern reckoning under the Gregorian calendar). It is a deposition in {{the records of}} a legal case at Guildford, Surrey, re {{the use of a}} parcel of land c.1550 and John Derrick, a coroner, testified that he had at that time played cricket on the land when he was a boy. Derrick's testimony makes clear that the sport was being played c.1550, but its true origin is a mystery. All that can be said with a fair degree of certainty is that <b>its</b> <b>beginning</b> was earlier than 1550, somewhere in south-east England within the counties of Kent, Sussex and Surrey. Unlike other games with batsmen, bowlers and fielders, such as stoolball and rounders, cricket can only be played on relatively short grass, especially as the ball was delivered along the ground until the 1760s. Therefore, forest clearings and land where sheep had grazed would have been suitable places to play.|$|E
5|$|The gold {{surfaces}} {{are decorated with}} scenes in basse-taille enamel with translucent colours that reflect light from the gold beneath; many areas of gold both underneath the enamel and in the background have engraved and pointillé decoration worked in the gold. In particular the decoration features large areas of translucent red, which have survived in excellent condition. This colour, known as rouge clair, {{was the most difficult}} to achieve technically, and highly prized for this and the brilliance of the colour when it was done successfully. Scenes from the life of Saint Agnes run round the top of the cover and the sloping underside of the main body. The symbols of the Four Evangelists run round the foot of the cup, and there are enamel medallions at the centre of the inside of both the cup and the cover. The lower of the two added bands contains enamel Tudor roses on a diapered pointillé background; this was apparently added under HenryVIII. The upper band has an engraved inscription filled in with black enamel, with a barrier of laurel branches in green to mark off the end of the inscription from <b>its</b> <b>beginning.</b>|$|E

Kourtney's boyfriend Scott Disick has also been appearing frequently on the show since the first season, {{as well as on}} the show's spin-offs. Cast members also include numerous friends and other acquaintances of the family members, most notably Malika Haqq and Jonathan Cheban who joined Keeping Up with the Kardashians in the second and third seasons, respectively.|$|E
