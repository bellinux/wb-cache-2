5000|$|Although 25 {{isotopes}} {{are known}} for sulfur, only four are stable and of geochemical importance. Of those four, two (32S, light and 34S, heavy) comprise (99.22%) of S on Earth. The vast majority (95.02%) of S occurs as 32S with only 4.21% in 34S. The ratio of these two isotopes is fixed {{in our solar system}} and has been since its formation. The bulk Earth sulfur isotopic ratio is thought to be the same as the ratio of 22.22 measured from the Canyon Diablo troilite (CDT), a meteorite. [...] That ratio is accepted as the international standard and is therefore set at δ0.00. Deviation from 0.00 is expressed as the δ34S which is a ratio in per mill (‰). Positive values correlate to increased levels of 34S, whereas negative values correlate with greater 32S in a sample. [...] Formation of sulfur minerals through non-biogenic processes does not substantially differentiate between the light and heavy isotopes, therefore sulfur values in gypsum or baryte should be the same as the overall ratio in the water column at [...] their time of precipitation. Sulfate reduction through biologic activity strongly differentiates between the two isotopes because of the more rapid <b>enzymic</b> <b>reaction</b> with 32S. [...] Sulfate metabolism results in an isotopic depletion of -18‰, and repeated cycles of oxidation and reduction can result in values up to -50 ‰. Average present day seawater values of δ34S are on the order of +21‰. [...] Throughout geologic history the sulfur cycle and the isotopic ratios have coevolved with the biosphere becoming overall more negative with the increases in biologically driven sulfate reduction, but also show substantial positive excursion. In general positive excursions in the sulfur isotopes mean that there is an excess of pyrite deposition rather than oxidation of sulfide minerals exposed on land.|$|E

Two {{possibilities that}} can explain this phenomenon are (1) that AC- 3579 inactivates the phospholipases, and (2) that an AC- 3579 -lipid interaction hinders the enzymic activity. To demonstrate these hypotheses, a physicochemical model of biological membrane, the lipid-water interface, has been used.

40|$|The isotope {{effect at}} C- 1 on the H 2 O 2 -catalysed {{decarboxylation}} of pyruvate (used {{as a model}} reaction for the <b>enzymic</b> <b>reaction)</b> increases between pH 3 and 10 from 1. 0007 +/- 0. 0004 to 1. 0283 +/- 0. 0014 (25 degrees C).

Practically no isotope fractionation at C- 1 (1. 0011 +/- 0. 0002, pH 6. 0, 25 degrees C) is found in the lactate oxidase-catalysed decarboxylation of lactate, which is indicative for the existence of an irreversible O 2 -dependent step prior to the enzyme-catalysed decarboxylation.

40|$|ABSTRACT The kinetic effects {{resulting}} from {{changes in the}} medium ionic strength on reactions involving trypsin or a-chymotrypsin are different. The reaction rate increases continuously as the ionic strength increases with ot-chymotrypsin. With trypsin, the rate increases at low ionic strengths but as the ionic strength further increases a gradual inhibitory effect is observed. The effects produced by different salts of various valence types (from uni-univalent to unitrivalent or tri-univalent) are essentially the same, {{and they are a}} function of the square root of the ionic strength. The quantitative differences among the various salts may be accounted for on the basis of individual properties of the ions, such as the size of the hydrated ion, "association, " etc. The effects of salts on the <b>enzymic</b> <b>reactions</b> described herein are amenable to the same electrostatic treatment applicable to non-enzymatic reactions. By applying Br 6 nstecl's basic kinetic concepts and the Debye-Hfickel law of electrolyte activity, it appears that the salt effects are mainly due to changes in the dissociation of ionizable groups. This appears to be a general method for analyzing the effect of inorganic ions on <b>enzymic</b> <b>reactions...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{intracellular}} {{distribution and}} level of acid hydrolases in Ochromonas malhamensis were studied in cells grown osmotrophically in a defined medium, in a carbon-free starvation medium, and during phagotrophy {{in each of these}} media. By cytochemical techniques, little <b>enzymic</b> <b>reaction</b> product was observed in the vacuoles of osmotrophic cells grown in the defined medium. Starved cells, however, contained autophagic vacuoles and cannibalized other Ochromonas cells. Dense <b>enzymic</b> <b>reaction</b> product was observed in the digestive vacuoles and in the Golgi cisternae of these starved cells. Moreover, starved cells and cells grown in a nutritionally complete medium ingested Escherichia coli which appeared in digestive vacuoles containing <b>enzymic</b> <b>reaction</b> product. Biochemical assays for lysosomal acid phosphatase (E. C. 3. 1. 3. 2 orthophosphoric monoester phosphohydrolase) and acid ribonuclease (E. C. 2. 7. 7. 16 ribonucleate nucleotido- 2 '-transferase) were done on Ochromonas cultures in the same experimental treatments and under identical assay conditions as the cytochemical study. During starvation, the acid hydrolase specific activities were consistently twice those found in cells grown in an osmotrophic complete medium. Ochromonas fed E. coli showed no increase in acid hydrolase specific activity as compared to controls not fed E. coli. The latency of lysosomal acid hydrolases in cells fixed with glutaraldehyde was reduced, suggesting that this fixative increases lysosomal membrane permeability and may release enzymes or their reaction products into the cytoplasmic matrix during cytochemical analysis. This could explain the cytoplasmic staining artifact sometimes observed with glutaraldehyde-fixed cells when studied by the Gomori technique. This study confirms that Ochromonas malhamensis, a phytoflagellate, does produce digestive vacuoles and can ingest bacteria, thereby fulfilling its role as a heterotroph in an aquatic food chain. When Ochromonas is grown in a nutritionally complete osmotrophic medium, phagocytosis causes appearance of acid hydrolases in the digestive vacuoles, whereas the total activity of the enzymes remains unchanged. An organic carbon-free medium strongly stimulates acid hydrolaes activity and causes these enzymes to appear in the digestive vacuoles whether phagocytosis occurs or not...|$|E
