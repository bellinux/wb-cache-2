5|$|Agaricus bernardii is a {{saprobic}} species. Its mushrooms fruit singly, scattered, or {{in groups}} on the ground. They grow in sandy soils, lawns, and in habitats with a high salt concentration, like along ocean coasts and salt marshes. Once primarily a maritime species, the fungus has spread inland to roadside verges where salt {{has been applied to}} <b>de-ice</b> the roads. Fruit bodies sometimes form underground. Mushrooms can also grow in fairy rings, especially when in grasslands or pastures. A Czech study determined that the mushrooms will strongly bioaccumulate silver from contaminated soil. Although the average concentration of silver in the soil is typically less than 1 milligram per kilogram of soil, it can be significantly elevated near industrial sites such as mines and smelters. The concentration of silver in the caps—which reached levels of up to 544mg per kg of mushroom tissue (dry weight)—was about twice that of the stems.|$|E

2500|$|The {{required}} power line is configured in <b>de-icing</b> mode {{after being separated}} from their AC circuit. Then, a line <b>de-icing</b> circuit is created {{by a set of}} [...] disconnect switches controlled by the DCU which [...] sends all of the commands to the <b>de-icing</b> converter. The DC current is slowly raised to reach the desired level of current. The <b>de-icing</b> disconnect switches are opened, and the DCU then releases the power line back to the AC network. The lines to be <b>de-iced</b> must stay in normal operation during the entire period of DCU development and start-up. The final installation of the SVC/ <b>de-icer</b> requires a <b>de-icing</b> line equipment pre-operational testing before being installed.The lines being <b>de-iced</b> must stay in normal operation during the start-up as well as throughout the whole period of DCU development. This system is rarely used, only for critical conditions as the operators would be under heavy stress and the man-machine interface (MMI) must be on guided mode. For the five lines being <b>de-iced,</b> there are 13 line topologies that have between 40 and 90 actions per line to be performed during the <b>de-icing</b> process. Out of the five lines, four have three <b>de-icing</b> circuit topologies and the other one only has one. The DCU must offer the possibility to manually confirm the equipment’s state to the operator in order to continue the process as there is always a chance of communication failure. Flexible stimulation sequences used for control logic and MMI validation, pre-operational testing and operator training are required for line equipment and SVC. For 735 kV lines, <b>de-icing</b> takes place in three steps while 315 kV double circuit lines only need one. A DCU supervises and coordinates all the actions required for <b>de-icing</b> each line in order to provide network security and ensure the <b>de-icing</b> sequences are reliable.|$|R

25|$|Built between 1929 and 1951, {{the highway}} had narrow confines—which could not {{accommodate}} trucks—and sharp S exit ramps {{that made it}} obsolete almost immediately.

When chunks of its facade began to fall off due to lack of maintenance, and a truck and car fell through it at 14th Street in 1973, the highway was shut down, and a debate began whether to renovate it or dismantle it. Attitudes to urban planning had changed in the intervening decades, and the decision was made not to repair the decaying structure.|$|E
25|$|Some of the PCC cars {{once owned}} by Twin City Rapid Transit are just {{beginning}} their lives as museum pieces. The Newark City Subway finished operation of their 24 remaining cars on August 24, 2001, replacing the cars with new light-rail trainsets.

In addition, 12 PCCs that ran on the Shaker Heights line are now owned by the Brooklyn Historic Railway Association.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is Aircraft Icing and Aircraft Icing and Thermo-Mechanical Expulsion <b>De-icing</b> Technology. The main {{objectives}} are to investigate aircraft icing meteorology and effects on aircraft, ice protection systems and thermo-mechanical expulsion <b>de-icing</b> technology. Initially, the research project focuses on aircraft icing meteorology, ice accumulation and icing effects on flight safety. A {{basic understanding of}} aircraft icing is explained, including icing conditions and parameters, ice detection, ice accretion shapes, and icing effects in terms of different airframe surfaces. Ice protection systems are employed to prevent the icing hazards and ensure flight safety. The conventional and novel ice protection technologies are investigated and their characteristics are explained. Thermo-mechanical expulsion <b>de-icing</b> technology is selected as the research topic because of its typical characteristics of lower power required and high <b>de-icing</b> efficiency. Methods are explored to assess power consumption of thermo-mechanical expulsion <b>de-icing</b> system. In addition, a thermo-mechanical expulsion <b>de-icing</b> system architecture is explored for a civil aircraft and system power consumption is calculated. In order to explain the system design characteristics, conventional electro-thermal <b>de-icing</b> system architecture is designed to show the contrasts in terms of power consumption, <b>de-icing</b> efficiency, cost and mass. This novel ice protection system has better results in power consumption and <b>de-icing</b> performance, allowing long time flight in icing conditions. It can compensate the disadvantages of heavier mass and higher cost {{because there is no}} need to escape from icing encounters immediately and fuel penalties are reduced sequentially...|$|R
25|$|The cockpit {{design of}} the TBM strives to be {{user-friendly}} and as uncomplicated to operate as possible. For pilot convenience, an automatic fuel selector automatically switches between fuel tanks periodically to effortlessly maintain fuel balance throughout flight; manual selection of fuel tanks is also possible, which remains overseen by a low fuel warning system. The ice protection system is as automated as possible, the windshield being electrically heated, the air inlet being kept warm by engine exhaust and the <b>de-ice</b> boots automatically cycling once activated. The electrically actuated flaps are monitored by a sophisticated split-flap protection system to prevent asymmetric deployment. An onboard air data computer calculates various values to support the pilot, such as the aircraft's true air speed, wind, and power advisory notices based upon current external temperature and altitude.|$|E

The oval section fuselage accommodated seats for ten passengers in two rows of five, with the two pilots sitting in an enclosed flight deck forward of the passenger cabin, while a cloakroom and baggage compartment aft of the cabin.

40|$|Abstract Two {{electro-mechanical}} <b>de-icing</b> {{systems are}} presented, which {{are applied to}} a test specimen consisting of a wing section with an NACA 0012 profile. The test specimen is of a modular design {{to be able to}} substitute the leading edge section for investigating the different <b>de-icing</b> systems. The <b>de-icing</b> tests are performed in the icing wind tunnel of the Institute of Fluid Mechanics of the TU Braunschweig. The first <b>de-icing</b> concept is an electromechanical system based on structural vibrations of the unstiffened sections. Due to piezoceramic actuators and their positions, the skin is excited at its natural frequency. The actuators are placed at the inner side of the leading edge. The second system under investigation is the Electro- Impulse <b>De-Icing</b> concept. Coils placed underneath the upper and lower aluminum skin are supplied with short, high-current impulses which produce opposing time-dependent magnetic fields around coil and skin. The resulting magnetic forces repel the structure which leads to a damped oscillation of the skin. The first aim of this work is to investigate the performance of the two electromechanical <b>de-icing</b> systems under various icing conditions. Operational parameters like temperature and liquid water content are varied. The test results show that the deicing performance of both systems mainly depends on the ice layer thickness and the environmental temperature. The second aim of this work is to investigate the <b>de-icing</b> mechanism of the accumulated ice. Therefore, the <b>de-icing</b> procedure is recorded with a high-speed camera...|$|R
