500|$|Soaps In Depth {{reported}} that Engen quickly gained viewer support after joining the cast as Adam, {{as did the}} character's romance with Heather. The support continued when the character took a dark turn. Engen said, [...] "To {{think there was any}} likability left in the character baffles me! I'm very grateful to the fans...they've been so supportive." [...] The actor said fans wanted Adam either redeemed or turned into a gray character. Davidson credited the character's likability to Engen's looks, saying, [...] "...he really nailed this character. Chris' all-American looks add another layer to this story: <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> regrets being so evil, but he can't help himself. When Chris informed me he was leaving, I told him he really accomplished something by being so likable playing this villain." [...] Nelson Branco repeatedly praised Engen's acting and Adam's storyline with Ashley and Victor, saying, [...] "he Haunting of Ashley is fast becoming one of my favorite all-time soap storylines ever. It's so 1970s. I have no doubt former Another World master scribe and Paul Rauch BFF/frenemy, Harding Lemay, is freaking if he's watching this gothic, macabre and super-creepy mystery. Moreover, camp-ilicious Chris Engen (Adam) is stealing the story with his very bitchy, and sexy performance of a deranged son scorned." [...] Soaps In Depth also commended Adam's storyline. The magazine awarded Engen a gold star for portraying Adam as a gray character with [...] "sardonic humor". Soap Opera Digest named Engen [...] "performer of the week" [...] for his final scenes as Adam, saying the actor [...] "gave a performance that elevated Adam from an average villain to a complex mastermind".|$|E
500|$|Burton's {{portrayal}} of Dylan has been generally well received. The character's romance with Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan), however, garnered a negative response from viewers and critics alike. Luke Kerr of Zap2it wrote that their storyline was [...] "everyone’s favorite storyline for curing insomnia". Despite negative reviews, Burton's portrayal during the storyline was praised, specifically by journalist Connie Passalacqua Hayman, who wrote: [...] "But it was Steve Burton as Dylan who {{stole the show}} with Dylan’s tearful and very sensitive reaction to the news, as his character loves what he believed to be his baby very much." [...] When {{the truth about the}} paternity of Chelsea's child was revealed, Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps remarked (in reference to Burton), [...] "When the truth came out it provided some meaty material for this fan favorite." [...] Sara Bibel of Xfinity gave a mixed review when Dylan was revealed as Nikki's son, writing: [...] "However, the foreshadowing that Dylan (Steve Burton) is going to turn out to be Nikki’s long-lost son is so heavy-handed that it seems hard to believe that the show is going in any other direction. Dylan is the right age. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> could be related to Nikki. The character is in desperate need of a more ties to the canvas; being Avery’s ex is not enough to keep him in town, much less front-and-center. My big objection to this twist is, what’s the actual story? We have spent months learning every single thing about this character who probably would not exist if Y hadn’t {{jumped at the chance to}} poach Burton from GH." [...] She added: [...] "Dylan would get a mother to replace his father that passed away. Nikki would get a child who can use his carpentry skills to build her a nice bookcase. That’s sweet, but it’s a situation, not a plot. There really aren’t any consequences. Nick would be angry that the guy he’s convinced Avery still loves is his half-brother, but he already has one half-brother he despises. Another one really isn’t a big deal." [...] Burton's portrayal earned him a nomination for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2014 and 2016.|$|E

Also mentioned {{is a story about}} a woman's body that was found in the local river and a hammer murderer that was on the loose.

5000|$|Newsweek {{magazine}}'s David Ansen wrote, [...] "For the film's mesmerizing first 50 minutes I thought De Niro might {{pull off}} the Godfather of spy movies ... Still, even if the movie's vast reach exceeds its grasp, it's a spellbinding history lesson". However, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine opined, [...] "It's tough to slog through a movie that has no pulse". In his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Jim Emerson wrote, [...] "If you think George Tenet's Central Intelligence Agency was a disaster, {{wait until you see}} Robert De Niro's torpid, ineffectual movie {{about the history of the}} agency". Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian gave the film two out of five stars and criticized Damon's performance: [...] "And why is Damon allowed to act in such a callow, boring way? As ever, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> is playing Robin to some imaginary Batman at his side, like Jimmy Stewart and his invisible rabbit. His nasal, unobtrusive voice makes every line sound the same".|$|E

Why, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> just stepped off a college campus. He's extremely handsome, {{but this is}} not what impresses me. He has sort of a—well. an all-encompassing type of magnetism. And he's a walking advertisement for marriage. Youcan't be with Jeff more than two minutes without realizing that he takes his marriage seriously, and adores his wife and child. He talks about them constantly, and with extreme pride... You would be certain to guess, even without knowing, that Jeff is the real athletic type. He likes to ski especially, and can you think of anyone who would look better soaring down a mountain? Fox gave Hunter his first starring role in Lure of the Wilderness (1952), a remake of Swamp Water, directed by Negulesco and opposite Jean Peters. After Dreamboat (1952), where Hunter supported Clifton Webb and Ginger Rogers, Hunter was given his best role yet: the starring part in a war film, Sailor of the King (1953), based on C.S. Forester's book, Brown on Resolution. Although financed by Fox it was essentially a British film, with British talent - Hunter was cast as a Canadian to explain his accent (his casting led to some difficulties with British film unions).|$|E

5000|$|Tony [...] "Duke" [...] Evers {{was first}} {{introduced}} in the 1976 Oscar-winning film Rocky as the trainer to the charismatic World Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed. A planned Bicentennial fight against number one contender Mac Lee Green was scheduled for January 1, 1976, which Apollo gladly hypes whenever someone places a microphone in front of him. However, Green hurts his left hand in training, and when {{none of the other}} top ranked contenders, such as Ernie Roman and Buddy Shaw, step up to face the champion, Creed responds with a novelty promotion that will generate huge publicity. He will offer an anonymous local fighter an opportunity to battle Creed for the title, in a match on New Year's Day in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Creed eventually selects Rocky Balboa, then an unknown club fighter, a shot at the championship. While Creed dismissed Rocky as a serious threat, Tony appeared to be the only member of Creed's staff who considered Balboa to be a legitimate threat, as he cautioned Creed of his vulnerability against southpaw opponents. Tony also expressed concern while closely observing Rocky's meat freezer sparring session at his friend Paulie's meat factory, which was broadcast on an edition of the evening news, saying to Creed, [...] "Hey champ, you ought to come here {{and take a look at}} this kid you're gonna' fight, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> means business". [...] "Yeah, Yeah, I mean business, too. Shirley, go get me some more coffee." [...] Creed replied in a casual and nonchalant tone as he and his entourage focused on business matters from another room. It is during this film where it is learned that Tony is more than just Apollo's trainer, but that they also have a long history and friendship dating back years. Prior to the final round of Creed's title defense against Balboa, Tony unsuccessfully urges Creed to let him stop the fight, and thus forfeit the championship, because he is worried for Apollo's health after it is revealed that he is bleeding internally as a result of Balboa's heavy body shots.|$|E
