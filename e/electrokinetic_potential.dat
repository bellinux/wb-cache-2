5000|$|Zeta {{potential}} is a scientific term for <b>electrokinetic</b> <b>potential</b> [...] in colloidal dispersions. In the colloidal chemistry literature, {{it is usually}} denoted using the Greek letter zeta (ζ), hence ζ-potential. From a theoretical viewpoint, the zeta {{potential is}} the electric potential in the interfacial double layer (DL) {{at the location of}} the slipping plane relative to a point in the bulk fluid away from the interface.

5000|$|The {{contact angle}} is {{determined}} by solving the Young’s equation for the interfacial force balance. At equilibrium three interfacial tensions corresponding to solid/gas (γSG), solid/liquid (γSL), and liquid/gas (γLG) interfaces are counterbalanced. The consequence of the contact angle's magnitudes is known as wetting phenomena, which is important to characterize the capillary (pore) intrusion behavior. Degree of membrane surface wetting {{is determined by}} the contact angle. The surface with smaller contact angle has better wetting properties (θ=0°-perfect wetting). In some cases low surface tension liquids such as alcohols or surfactant solutions are used to enhance wetting of non-wetting membrane surfaces. [...] The membrane surface free energy (and related hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity) influences membrane particle adsorption or fouling phenomena. In most membrane separation processes (especially bioseparations), higher surface hydrophilicity corresponds to the lower fouling. Synthetic membrane fouling impairs membrane performance. As a consequence, a wide variety of membrane cleaning techniques have been developed. Sometimes fouling is irreversible, and the membrane needs to be replaced. Another feature of membrane surface chemistry is surface charge. The presence of the charge changes the properties of the membrane-liquid interface. The membrane surface may develop an <b>electrokinetic</b> <b>potential</b> and induce the formation of layers of solution particles which tend to neutralize the charge.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the cream}} is inoculated with starter {{bacteria}} and the bacteria begins converting lactose to lactic acid, the pH begins a slow decrease. When this decrease begins, dissolution of calcium phosphate occurs, and causes a rapid {{drop in the}} pH. During the processing step fermentation the pH was dropped from 6.5 to 4.6, this drop in pH brings on a physicochemical change to the casein micelles. Recall the casein proteins are heat stable, {{but they are not}} stable in certain acidic conditions. The colloidal particles are stable at the normal pH of milk which is 6.5-6.7, the micelles will precipitate at the isoelectric point of milk which is a pH of 4.6. At a pH of 6.5 the casein micelles repulse each other due to the electronegativity of the outer layer of the micelle. During this drop in pH there is a reduction in zeta potential, from the highly net negative charges in cream to no net charge when approaching the PI. [...] The formula shown is the Henry's equation, where z: zeta potential, Ue: electrophoretic mobility, ε: dielectric constant, η: viscosity, and f(Ka): Henry's function. This equation is used to find the zeta potential, which is calculated to find the <b>Electrokinetic</b> <b>potential</b> in colloidal dispersion's. Through electrostatic interactions the casein molecules begin approaching and aggregating together. The casein proteins enter a more ordered system, attributing to a strong gel structure formation.

40|$|<b>Electrokinetic</b> <b>potentials,</b> {{sometimes}} {{known as}} streaming potentials, are generated by fluid-flow, heat fluxes, pressure sources and diffusion potentials across boundaries between a fluid electrolyte and mineral grains or rock particles in fractured rocks and porous media. In the electrical double layer model (Stern model, Figure 1), {{there is an}} immobile layer that {{is divided into two}} by the Stern plane. The layer nearest the mineral grain is immobile, and the surface of the mineral grain has a net charge so that it adsorbs cations from the fluid in an electrical double layer. Away from the grain boundaries, the mobile part of the fluid may have a surplus of positive or negative ions, depending on the electrostatic charge distribution at the electrical double layer. The excess density of ionic species can be transported with fluid flow producing an advective electric current. The advective flow of charge is balanced by a return electric current; this process is known as coupled flow. The electric potential in the Stern layer varies as a function of distance.

The surface structure of the treated PET is determined by laser Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). The results show that a thin amorphous polymer-like carbon (PLC) layer is formed on the PET surface. Atomic force micrographs (AFM) show that C 2 H 2 PIII-D significantly changes the surface morphology of PET. The capacities of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE) to adhere onto PET are quantitatively determined by plate counting and Gamma-ray counting of 125 I radio labeled bacteria in vitro. The results indicate that the adhesion of the two kinds of bacteria to PET is suppressed by PLC. The adhesion efficiency of SE on the coated surface is only about 14 % of that of the untreated PET surface, and that of SA is about 35 % of that of the virgin surface. The <b>electrokinetic</b> <b>potentials</b> of the bacterial cells and substrates are determined by zeta potential measurement. All the substrates as well as the bacterial strain have negative zeta potentials, and it means that bacterial adhesion is not mediated by electrostatic interactions. The surface energy components of the various substrates and bacteria are calculated based on measurements in water, formamide and diiodomethane. The surface free energies obtained are used to calculate the interfacial free energies of adhesion (ΔFAdh) of SA and SE onto various substrates, and it is found that bacterial adhesion is energetically unfavorable on the PLC deposited on PET by C 2 H 2 PIII-D. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

For many purposes, particularly tribological, the most satisfactory solution is frequently {{the application of a}} resistant coating to the surface of a common metal. Electrodeposited cermet coatings have proved very satisfactory: some of the factors underlying the cernet electrodeposition process have been investigated. A ceramic particle in contact with an electrolyte solution will carry a charge which may affect the kinetics of the suspended particle under electroplating conditions. Measurerment has been made of this charge on particles of silicon carbide, chrornium diboride and quartz, in contiact with solutions of copper sulphate/ sulphuric acid in terms of the <b>electrokinetic</b> (zeta) <b>potential</b> and also as surface charge density. The methocl used was that of streaming potential and streaming current measuremen...|$|R
