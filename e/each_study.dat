5|$|It is {{possible}} to combine the results of several small studies to produce evidence that is stronger than that available from <b>each</b> <b>study</b> alone—a statistical method known as meta-analysis. One of four such analyses, conducted in 2006, looked at 19 studies on a total of 1,084 patients. It concluded that half the patients achieved a 50% reduction in seizures and a third achieved a 90% reduction.|$|E
25|$|As {{the above}} {{discussion}} makes clear, any ABC analysis requires choices and trade-offs {{that can have}} a considerable impact on its outcomes. Specifically, the choice of competing models/hypotheses, the number of simulations, the choice of summary statistics, or the acceptance threshold cannot currently be based on general rules, but {{the effect of these}} choices should be evaluated and tested in <b>each</b> <b>study.</b>|$|E

25|$|Physiological, {{behavioral}} and anatomical evidence show that some species {{may have a}} functioning olfactory system in utero. Newborn infants respond positively to the smell of their own amniotic fluid, which may serve as evidence for intrauterine olfactory learning. Mammals’ sense of smell becomes mature {{at an early stage}} of development. Fetal olfactory memory has been demonstrated in rats, for example. This is shown by rat pups, who avoid odors that they experienced in association with a noxious stimulus prior to birth. While animal studies {{play an important role in}} helping discover and learn olfaction memory of humans, it is important to pay attention to the specifics of <b>each</b> <b>study,</b> as they cannot always be generalized across all species.|$|E
25|$|The {{yellowstripe scad}} has been {{included}} in several phylogenetic analyses of the Carangidae, with <b>each</b> <b>study</b> suggesting slightly different relationships. All studies confirmed its placement in the subfamily Caranginae, a monophyletic grouping including the trevallies, jacks, scads and horse mackerels. The first of these studies by Soko Gushiken was based on morphological characteristics and found the species {{was part of a}} monophyletic clade of the scads and horse mackerels with Atule, Selar, Trachurus and Decapterus, being most closely related to Atule. A 1987 analysis of genetic divergence amongst the scads and horse mackerels using isozyme electrophoresis indicated the species was most closely related to Selar, forming a monophyletic clade with Trachurus, but being more distant from Decapterus. Two studies in 2002 and 2007 of mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences generally agreed that Selaroides was most closely related to Selar (depending on analysis type), however both indicated a closer relationship to the deeper bodied genera such as Caranx and Hemicaranx than to the scads of Trachurus and Decapterus.|$|E
25|$|Several {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} regarding the potential of applying virtual reality to different therapies. A systematic literature review published in 2012 analyzed 963 publications regarding virtual reality and rehabilitation from 1996 and 2010. Investigators found an increasing number of research done in the field yearly, from less than 10 articles per year in 1997 to more than 40 in 2010. More than the number of articles analyzed, this literature review found important issues to be addressed in future studies: i) the need to consider a greater number of participants in <b>each</b> <b>study</b> to best represent the target populations; ii) to improve the use of control groups; iii) to enhance the uniformity of the tests applied and iv) to execute more follow up studies in the field. These aspects would allow the comparison among different studies and the conceptualization of the results from different studies. Lastly, this investigation cites the importance of research in the field of virtual reality and rehabilitation, once the potential of this technology is recognized to support the neural and cognitive rehabilitation of different patients.|$|E

2500|$|This {{technique}} {{is used by}} research scientists {{around the world to}} produce [...] "in-house" [...] printed microarrays from their own labs.

They can then generate their own labeled samples for hybridization, hybridize the samples to the array, and finally scan the arrays with their own equipment. This provides a relatively low-cost microarray that may be customized for <b>each</b> <b>study,</b> and avoids the costs of purchasing often more expensive commercial arrays that may represent vast numbers of genes that are not of interest to the investigator.|$|E
