However, if a horse is never allowed to lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and in rare cases may {{suddenly}} collapse as it involuntarily slips into REM sleep while still standing. This condition differs from narcolepsy, although horses may also suffer from that disorder.|$|E
5|$|By 1969, Clarence13X {{became very}} tired and slept little. He feared {{that he would}} be killed and {{instructed}} his followers to remain strong if he died. On June12, he spent time with several of his disciples at their school. He left the school between 2:00 and 3:00 am on June 13 and then gambled <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> As was his occasional practice, he traveled to Dora Smith's house to rest. He was ambushed by three assailants who fatally shot him {{while he was in the}} lobby of her apartment building. That morning, several people from the mayor's office met with his family, and the mayor later visited the Five Percenters' school to express condolences.|$|E
500|$|The {{shipyard}} generated high {{employment to}} Jarrow, but the industrial works created a harsh environment. Ellen Wilkinson, the town's historian {{and member of}} parliament from 1935 to 1947, quotes a newspaper source from 1858: [...] "There is a prevailing blackness about the neighbourhood. The houses are black, the ships are black, the sky is black, {{and if you go}} there <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> reader, you will be black". According to Wilkinson, the yard's founder, Sir Charles Palmer, [...] "regarded it as no part of his duty to see that the conditions under which his workers had to live were either sanitary or tolerable".|$|E

500|$|King George was {{extremely}} devoted to Octavius, who {{was too young}} to cause the kinds of trouble that his elder brothers were by the year of his birth. The king was affectionate and indulgent with his young children, and strove to attend their birthday parties and other events organized for their merriment; on one occasion a friend witnessed a happy domestic scene that involved George [...] "carrying about in his arms by turns Sophia and the last prince, Octavius." [...] Another witness wrote George and Charlotte [...] "have their Children always playing about them the whole time"; during most evenings the children were brought to their parents between 6 and 7 O'clock to play <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> The king also was kept informed of his children's educational progress.|$|E
500|$|A lack of [...] "eye-popping unpredictability [...] its predecessors" [...] and {{difficult}} controller positions disappointed 1UP.com, but the website still called WarioWare: Smooth Moves a [...] "welcome addition to any Wii library". Described as a [...] "certifiably insane party game {{that is a}} must buy for any Wii owner", GamePro felt that the game further proves that the Wii is the [...] "must-have" [...] console when playing with friends. GamesRadar shared this sentiment, noting that although the game's single-player mode is only several hours long, its multiplayer mode is the [...] "definite Wii party experience" [...] for up to 12 people. Game Informer felt excited, surprised, and a [...] "little stupid" [...] when waving the Wii remote with the game, concluding that the game will make [...] "friends laugh pretty much non-stop <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> and that {{may very well be}} worth the price of admission". Despite writing positively about how the game utilizes the Wii remote, Eurogamer was disappointed with its weak long-term appeal because [...] "it never really dares to test players".|$|E
500|$|However, Mercury and {{his inner}} circle of colleagues and friends, whom he felt he could trust, {{continually}} denied the stories, even after one front-page article published on 29 April 1991, showed Mercury appearing very haggard in what was by then a rare public appearance. It {{has been suggested that}} he could have made a contribution to AIDS awareness by speaking earlier about his situation and his fight against the disease. Mercury kept his condition private to protect those closest to him, with Brian May confirming in a 1993 interview he had informed the band of his illness much earlier. Filmed in May 1991, the music video for [...] "These Are the Days of Our Lives" [...] features a very thin Mercury, in what are his final scenes in front of the camera. The rest of the band were ready to record when Mercury felt able to come into the studio, <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> at a time. May says of Mercury: [...] "He just kept saying. 'Write me more. Write me stuff. I want to just sing this and do it and when I am gone you can finish it off.' He had no fear, really." [...] Justin Shirley-Smith, the assistant engineer for those last sessions, states: [...] "This is hard to explain to people, but it wasn't sad, it was very happy. He [...] was one of the funniest people I ever encountered. I was laughing most of the time, with him. Freddie was saying [...] 'I'm not going to think about it, I'm going to do this.' ...|$|E

500|$|Desperate for a break, the overworked band {{began to}} argue and {{tensions}} formed. Raynor, {{who was at}} the center of this drama, had been commenting of his desire to attend college for years, and had been taking homework out with him on tour to try and complete his high school diploma. The tension came to a head in February 1998 as the band embarked on SnoCore, described as [...] "a winter version of the Warped Tour." [...] Sharing the stage with Primus, the band was enjoying more success than ever before, but the drama between the musicians had grown substantially. The band reached a low point when the band engaged in a fight on a Nebraska date after SnoCore's conclusion. Raynor would depart following SnoCore, and the ensemble recruited Travis Barker, drummer for the opening ska punk group The Aquabats, to fill in for Raynor. Barker, who had not had time to prepare or practice with the duo, learned the drum tracks for the 20-song setlist in only 45 minutes before the first show and performed them flawlessly thereafter. [...] "I remember Travis rehearsing backstage <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> then playing with them during sound-check," [...] said Adam Deibert of the Aquabats. [...] "A few of us were standing behind the stage and vividly remember the feeling of this is the new Blink. We should have looked for a new drummer right then because it was obvious what band he belonged in." [...] Shortly thereafter, the band embarked on a short minitour along the western coast, most notably Southern California, the band's favorite place to play. The tour ended with the band headlining a sold-out show at the Palladium in Hollywood, California, where the band had dreamed of performing at for years. [...] Raynor returned for the band's Palladium performance, but the band became increasingly uneasy and arguments grew worse. To offset personal issues and a [...] "tragic loss," [...] Raynor began to drink heavily and it began to affect the band's performances.|$|E
2500|$|Days, weeks, months, {{and even}} years might have passed on {{much in the}} same manner....

2500|$|Innuendo was {{released}} in early 1991 with an eponymous number 1 UK hit and other charting singles released later in the year, which included [...] "The Show Must Go On". This song, released as a forerunner to Greatest Hits II in October 1991, featured archive footage of Queen's performances between 1981 and 1989, and along with the manner of its lyrics, this continued to fuel the media reports that Mercury was dying, although this was still officially denied. Mercury was increasingly ill and could barely walk when the band recorded [...] "The Show Must Go On" [...] in 1990. Because of this, May had concerns about whether he was physically capable of singing it. Recalling Mercury's successful performance May states; [...] "he went in and killed it, completely lacerated that vocal". The rest of the band were ready to record when Mercury felt able {{to come into the}} studio, <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> at a time. May says of Mercury: [...] "He just kept saying. 'Write me more. Write me stuff. I want to just sing this and do it and when I am gone you can finish it off.’ He had no fear, really." [...] The band's second greatest hits compilation, Greatest Hits II, followed in October 1991, which is the eighth best-selling album of all time in the UK and has sold 16 million copies worldwide.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the first}} hour after a nuclear explosion, {{radioactivity}} levels drop precipitously. Radioactivity levels are further reduced by about 90% after another 7 hours and by about 99% after 2 days. An accurate rule of thumb for approximating the radioactive dose rate produced by the decay of the myriad of isotopes present in nuclear fallout is the [...] "7/10 rule". The rule states that for each 7 fold increase in time the dose rate drops {{by a factor of}} 10. For example, assuming the fallout process has ended and the dose rate is a lethal in one hour exposure, 500 roentgens per hour, at one hour after detonation, then 7 hours after detonation the rate will be 50 R/hr, 49 hours after detonation (7×7 hours) the dose rate will be 5 R/hr, 343 hours after detonation (49×7—or about 2 weeks) the dose rate will be about 0.5 R/hr, at which point no special precautions would need to be taken and venturing outside into that dose rate <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> would pose a close to negligible health hazard, thus permitting an evacuation to be done with acceptable safety to a known contamination free zone. Following a surface-burst nuclear detonation, approximately 80 percent of the fallout would be deposited on the ground during the first 24 hours.|$|E
