5000|$|When an {{operator}} keying {{data to be}} verified encountered an error, the operator was given a second and third try to re-enter the data {{that was supposed to}} be in the field. If the third try was incorrect an error notch was put on the top of the card over the column with the error and the [...] "OK" [...] punch at the end of the card was not enabled. The data on the card could actually be correct, since the verifier operator was just as likely to make an error as the <b>keypunch</b> <b>operator.</b> However, with three tries, the operator was less likely to repeatedly make the same error. Some verifier operators were able to guess the error on the card created by the previous <b>keypunch</b> <b>operator,</b> defeating the purpose of the verify procedure, and thus some machines were altered to allow only one entry and error notched on the second try.|$|E
5000|$|Original {{data was}} usually punched into cards by workers, often women, known as <b>keypunch</b> <b>{{operator}}s.</b> Their work was often checked {{by a second}} operator using a verifier machine.|$|R

5000|$|Another such symbol was [...] This {{was used}} {{in the early years of}} {{computer}} programming when writing on coding forms. <b>Keypunch</b> <b>operators</b> immediately recognized the symbol as an [...] "explicit space". It {{was used in}} BCDIC, EBCDIC, and ASCII-1963.|$|R
50|$|Keypunches {{and punched}} cards were still {{commonly}} used for both data and program entry through the 1970s but were rapidly made obsolete {{by changes in}} the entry paradigm and by the availability of inexpensive CRT computer terminals. Eliminating the step of transferring punched cards to tape or disk (with {{the added benefit of}} saving the cost of the cards themselves) allowed for improved checking and correction during the entry process. The development of video display terminals, interactive timeshared systems and, later, personal computers allowed those who originated the data or program to enter it directly instead of writing it on forms to be entered by <b>keypunch</b> <b>operators.</b>|$|R
50|$|In many data {{processing}} applications, the punched cards were verified by keying {{exactly the same}} data a second time, {{checking to see if}} the second keying and the punched data were the same (known as two pass verification). There was a great demand for <b>keypunch</b> <b>operators,</b> usually women, who worked full-time on keypunch and verifier machines, often in large keypunch departments with dozens or hundreds of other operators, all performing data input. In the 1950s, Remington Rand introduced the UNITYPER, which enabled data entry directly to magnetic tape for UNIVAC systems. Mohawk Data Sciences subsequently produced an improved magnetic tape encoder in 1965, which was somewhat successfully marketed as a keypunch replacement. The rise of microprocessors and inexpensive computer terminals {{led to the development of}} additional key-to-tape and key-to-disk systems from smaller companies such as Inforex and Pertec.|$|R
5000|$|In this example, if the <b>keypunch</b> <b>operator</b> typed a few {{characters}} at {{the beginning}} of the card and then pressed the skip key, the keypunch would tab to column 10.Note: [...] "Field Definition" [...] (12) and [...] "Alphabetic Shift" [...] (1) prints as an A. If program 2 codes were punched, invalid characters could be generated that the printer did not know how to print, some of which could even damage the printer.|$|E
50|$|The IBM 056 was the {{verifier}} {{companion to}} the 024 Card Punch and 026 Printing Card Punch. The verifier {{was similar to}} the 026 keypunch except for a red error lens in the machine cover lower center. The verifier operator entered exactly the same data as the <b>keypunch</b> <b>operator</b> and the verifier machine then checked to see if the punched data matched. Successfully verified cards had a small notch punched on the right hand edge.|$|E
50|$|Following her {{baseball}} career Mainsfield {{returned to}} her homeland of Jamaica Plains {{and worked as a}} <b>keypunch</b> <b>operator</b> at a number of firms. After retiring, she became an active collaborator of the AAGPBL Players Association. With former AAGPBL pitcher June Peppas at the helm, the association was largely responsible for the opening of a permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled in 1988 to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.|$|E
5000|$|A {{punched card}} is a {{flexible}} write-once medium that encodes data, most commonly 80 characters. Groups or [...] "decks" [...] of cards form programs and collections of data. Users could create cards using a desk-sized keypunch with a typewriter-like keyboard. A typing error generally necessitated repunching an entire card. In some companies, programmers wrote information on special forms called coding sheets, {{taking care to}} distinguish the digit zero from the letter O, the digit one from the letter I, eight from B, two from Z, and so on. These forms were then converted to cards by <b>keypunch</b> <b>operators,</b> and in some cases, checked by verifiers. The editing of programs was facilitated by reorganizing the cards, and removing or replacing the lines that had changed; programs were backed up by duplicating the deck, or writing it to magnetic tape.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION All {{aspects of}} human-computer interaction, from the {{high-level}} concerns of organizational context and system requirements to the conceptual, semantic, and syntactic levels of user interface design, are ultimately funneled through physical {{input and output}} actions and devices. This chapter considers the input half of this physical level of human-computer interaction, the final {{means by which the}} user communicates information to the computer. It is also called the Lexical level of the design of an interactive system, in contrast to the successively higher Syntactic, Semantic, and Conceptual levels [Foley, 1990 a]. Computer input once consisted of such actions as setting switches and knobs and plugging and unplugging jumper wires in patch boards. For many years after that, the primary form of computer input was the punched card. Users or, more often, specialist <b>keypunch</b> <b>operators</b> punched the input information as holes in paper cards, which could then be read by comput...|$|R
40|$|Information on {{geologic}} formations {{has always}} been needed by government agencies, industries, and individuals interested in mineral and water resources. Increasing interest in these resources and in the growing environmental problems caused by underground storage of materials and waste disposal has created a need for ready access to geologic data. Several government agencies in Minnesota collect {{a large amount of}} geologic data. Until the present time each agency maintained its own file, although exchange of data has occurred often and freely. However, to avoid duplication of effort and to establish the most efficient data storage and retrieval system it was decided that the Minnesota Geological Survey would maintain the central file of geologic data for the State and that the data should be stored in a digital computer system. A printout would then be provided of whatever geologic data was requested by other agencies and individuals. The first need in establishing a system for computer processing of geologic data is to store geologic logs on machine-readable punched cards. The purpose of this report is to provide instructions for recording and coding geologic log data in such a manner that it can be punched by <b>keypunch</b> <b>operators...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Sanford {{was born}} Eloise Gwendolyn Sanford in Harlem, New York, to James Edward and Josephine Sanford (née Perry). She was the {{youngest}} of seven children and was the only child to survive beyond infancy. Sanford's mother Josephine was devoutly religious and insisted that her daughter attend church every Sunday and occasionally made her attend on weeknights. As a teenager, Sanford aspired to be an actress but her mother discouraged her dream as she felt that show business was [...] "the road to degradation". Sanford disobeyed her mother and began performing at local clubs. She also performed at amateur night at the Apollo Theater. After graduating from high school, Sanford joined Harlem's American Negro Theater and the Star Players. She made her professional stage debut in 1946 in On Strivers Row and appeared in several off-Broadway productions while also working as a <b>keypunch</b> <b>operator</b> at IBM. Sanford married house painter William Edward [...] "Sonny" [...] Richmond with whom she had three children. Their marriage was tumultuous and they later separated.|$|E

40|$|The {{proximity}} {{among people}} in an organization is known to exert considerable influence {{on a variety of}} organizational outcomes such as performance, stress, and job satisfaction. Early research on proximity in organizations studied pairs of people in job locations that were at fixed distances (e. g., <b>keypunch</b> <b>operators</b> at their work stations). This research procedure ignores three critical features of organizational life. First, people are simultaneously proximate to everyone else in their organization. Second, this proximity changes throughout the day as people move about the organization. Finally, the opportunity and obligation for communication that people perceive by being physically close to others is often more important than the actual physical distance. The present paper develops a definition of organizational proximity that accounts for these previous limitations. Specifically, organizational proximity is defined as two or more people being in the same location where there is both the opportunity and psychological obligation for face-to-face communication. This measure, when aggregated across all {{people in an}} organization, provides a single value of how concentrated people are in the various locations of the firm. Further, given the proper data collection techniques, it reveals the degree to which organizational proximity changes throughout the workday and workweek. On the basis of this definition, research was conducted which examined the organizational proximity among employees in a research and development firm for each 15 -minute interval of a typical workweek. Two major findings were obtained. First, the level of organizational proximity changed considerably {{during the course of a}} typical day, with peaks during the late morning and early afternoon and valleys during the early morning, lunch, and late afternoon hours. Second, the pattern was highly consistent from day-to-day. This consistency permitted the development of a model which enables accurate prediction of the level of organizational density for any time period during any day of the workweek. There are several rather interesting managerial implications in these results. First, they support Peters and Waterman's (Peters, T. J., R. H. Waterman. 1982. Search of Excellence: Lessons from America's Best-Run Companies. Harper & Row, New York, 3 [...] 26, 119 [...] 155, 200 [...] 234.) recent recommendation of "management by wandering around," since that technique maximizes a manager's proximity to employees. Second, the results suggest managerial and electronic alternatives to traditional forms of communication such as face-to-face meetings and phonecalls. Third, they imply alternative strategies for managing the daily fluctuations in availability of people and communication that result from differences and changes in organizational proximity. organizational proximity...|$|R
40|$|Transcript, 100 pp. In this {{interview}} computer security pioneer William Murray begins by discussing early work experiences and influences (his {{father was an}} IBM CE and manager, {{and his mother was}} a <b>keypunch</b> <b>operator).</b> The bulk of the interview focuses on his work at IBM in computer security and his reflections on developments in this field. This includes efforts with computer security at IBM SHARE, Bob Courtney as an early leader at IBM in this field, Horst Feistel and the cryptographic research group at IBM, MVS TSO, IBM’s MVS Integrity Commitment, TCSEC, and RACF. He also provides context to a number of his publications including his influential Access Control Facility for AAS and Data Security and Controls. Murray was an influential figure with ISC-squared and the CISSP security credential and the auditing and forensics sides to security (working as a consultant for Deloitte & Touche and Ernst & Young after leaving IBM).
