40|$|A {{key feature}} {{of the immune system}} is its ability to {{discriminate}} self from nonself. Breakdown in any of the mechanisms that maintain unresponsiveness to self (a state known as self-tolerance) contributes to the development of autoimmune conditions. Recent studies in mice show that CD 8 + T cells specific for the unconventional MHC class I molecule Qa- 1 bound to peptides derived from the signal sequence of Hsp 60 (Hsp 60 sp) contribute to self/nonself discrimination. However, it is unclear whether they exist in humans and play a role in human autoimmune diseases. Here we have shown that CD 8 + T cells specific for Hsp 60 sp bound to HLA-E (the human homolog of Qa- 1) exist and {{play an important role in}} maintaining peripheral self-tolerance by discriminating self from nonself in humans. Furthermore, in the majority of type 1 diabetes (T 1 D) patients tested, there was a specific defect in CD 8 + T cell recognition of HLA-E/Hsp 60 sp, which was associated with failure of self/nonself discrimination. However, the defect in the CD 8 + T cells from most of the T 1 D patients tested could be corrected in vitro by exposure to autologous immature DCs loaded with the Hsp 60 sp peptide. These data suggest that HLA-E–restricted CD 8 + T cells may play an important role in <b>keeping</b> self-reactive <b>T</b> cells in check. Thus, correction of this defect could be a potentially effective and safe approach in the therapy of T 1 D...|$|R
40|$|Since pope John XXIII {{has used}} the word "aggiornamento", it has entered into the {{vocabulary}} of the universal Church, of most theologians, and of many among the faithful. Referring to the relationship to our time the author finds three implicit pre-suppositions included in the term "aggiornamento", the first two being assertions, the third one a demand: 1. We, who are using this expression, are lagging behind our time, we aren 2 ̆ 7 <b>t</b> <b>keeping</b> abreast. 2. Some other people are in front of us, they are modern and progressive. Their progress is our ideal. 3. Our falling behind and their progress urges us to approach them, to reach them and become equal to them. No matter how much the term "aggiornamento" is a modern one, the author is {{of the opinion that}} the task of theology is to consider everything "sub specie aeternitatis", through the prism of eternity. This distinguishes it from all other sciences. Therefore, within the Church, the only adequate term for true updating, modernising or making current can only be eternalizing/perpetuating...|$|R
