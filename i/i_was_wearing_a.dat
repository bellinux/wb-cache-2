Raekwon later explained [...] "The Wu-Gambinos aliases come from how I used to like that movie Once Upon a Time in America, with Robert De Niro and James Woods. I liked how these young little niggas grew up, from the ground up, not having nothing to start. And the names came. You know, [...] "Tony Starks" [...] came from Iron Man. [...] "Lou Diamond" [...] came from Louis Roederer who made Cristal, and from me being infatuated with the diamond world. Back then <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> lot of ice, was calling shit ice. But then I started giving some of my niggas in the crew names. Being that it's my album, I wanted niggas to know, you gotta have a certain a.k.a. when you're on this track. This is a Gambino track. Wu-Gambinos. I would call Masta Killa [...] "Noodles," [...] call GZA [...] "Maximillian." [...] Inside the movie (Once Upon a Time in America), Noodles and Max was partners. I felt like GZA was like Maximillian because he was like the brains of the crew. He would say something real intellectual and smart. I called Deck [...] "Rollie Fingers" [...] cause of the way he roll blunts. So names just started fitting niggas." ...|$|E

Once when I was a little girl, {{eight or nine years}} of age--it was just before that kind of {{awakening}} of which I have spoken to you--I was playing in Kensington Gardens, for we lived in London at the time, in the charge of my nurse-governess. She was talking to some young man who she said was her cousin, and told me to run about with my hoop and not to bother. I drove the hoop across the grass to some elm trees. From behind one of the trees came out two tall men dressed in white robes and turbans, who looked to me like scriptural characters in a picture-book. One was an elderly man with flashing, black eyes, hooked nose, and a long grey beard. The other was much younger, but I do not remember him so well. They were both brown in colour, but otherwise almost like white men; not Negroes by any means. My hoop hit the elder man, and I stood still, not knowing what to say. He bowed politely and picked it up, but did not offer to return it to me. They talked together rapidly, and one of them pointed to the moon-shaped birthmark which you see I have upon my neck, for it was hot weather, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> low-cut frock. It was because of this mark that my father named me Luna. The elder of the two said in broken English: ...|$|E

However, it was all past, long ago, when I recognized Melford in the smoking-room that night: {{it must have been}} ten or a dozen years. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> full beard then, and so was he; we wore as much beard as we could in those days. I had been through the war since college, and he had been in California, most of the time, and, as he told me, he had been up north, in Alaska, just after we bought it, and hurt his eyes--had snow-blindness--and he wore spectacles. In fact, I had to do most of the recognizing, but after we found out who we were we were rather comfortable; and I liked him better than I remembered to have liked him in our college days. I don't suppose there was ever much harm in him; it was only my grudge about his nightmare. We talked along and smoked along for about an hour, and I could hear the porter outside, making up the berths, and the train rumbled away towards Framingham, and then towards Worcester, and I began to be sleepy, and to think I would go to bed myself; and just then the door of the smoking-room opened, and a young girl put in her face a moment, and said: 'Oh, I beg your pardon. I thought it was the stateroom,' and then she shut the door, and I realized that she looked like a girl I used to know." ...|$|E
