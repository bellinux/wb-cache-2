500|$|After the Restoration and King Charles II's {{return to}} London on 29 May 1660, a pall-mall court was {{constructed}} in St James's Park {{just south of the}} wall, on the site of The Mall. Samuel Pepys's diary entry for 2 April 1661 records that he [...] "...went into St. James's Park, where I saw the Duke of York playing at Pelemele, the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> ever saw the sport." [...] This new court suffered from dust blown over the wall from coaches travelling along the highway. In July 1661 posts and rails were erected, stopping up the old road. The court for pall-mall was very long and narrow, and often known as an alley, so the old court provided a suitable route for relocating the eastern approach to St James's Palace. A grant was made to Dan O'Neale, Groom of the Bedchamber, and John Denham, Surveyor of the King's Works allocating a [...] area of land for this purpose. The grant was endorsed [...] "Our warrant for the building of the new street to St James's." ...|$|E
500|$|Cross was {{promoted}} to brigadier on 30 June 1996. He was appointed Director, Materiel Supply and Distribution (Army), a post which became Director, Materiel Support (Army) in 1997 {{as a result of}} re-organisation, based in Andover, Hampshire. At the end of 1997, he took command of the British National Support Element in the Balkans, responsible for supplying the British contingent of the NATO-led Stabilisation Force (SFOR). At the same time, he commanded the Combat Service Support Group, later renamed 101 Logistic Brigade. He returned to the UK in April 1998, only to be told that he would be returning to the Balkans in January 1999 as part of the Kosovo Force (KFOR). In this role, he was responsible for the humanitarian effort {{in the aftermath of the}} Kosovo War, establishing and maintaining refugee camps in Macedonia and Albania. He was tasked with commanding multinational troops, as well as coordinating the humanitarian efforts of personnel from the British Department for International Development, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and multiple non-governmental organisations. Speaking about his service with KFOR, he later called it a [...] "challenging and demanding deployment" [...] and [...] "the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have come face to face with a large-scale humanitarian crisis." [...] He went on to say that the most challenging part was the military working alongside large numbers of civilian agencies and that the Army needed to learn how to better work with such organisations—a need he said was [...] "widely recognised" [...] outside the military. In recognition of his service in the Balkans, Cross was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2000 New Year Honours List.|$|E

2500|$|Robert Peel, {{often called}} the [...] "model Prime Minister", {{was the first to}} {{recognise}} this new role. After the successful Conservative campaign of 1841, J. W. Croker said in a letter to Peel, [...] "The elections are wonderful, and the curiosity is that all turns on the name of Sir Robert Peel. It's the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> remember in our history that the people have chosen the first Minister for the Sovereign. Mr. Pitt's case in '84 is the nearest analogy; but then the people only confirmed the Sovereign's choice; here every Conservative candidate professed himself in plain words to be Sir Robert Peel's man, and on that ground was elected." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Taguba was {{assigned}} to report on abuse of prisoners in Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. In May of that year, he published an extremely critical report that was leaked to the public.

[...] "The Anarchists" [...] (referring to the Spanish CNT and FAI) were [...] "in control", tipping was prohibited by workers themselves, and servile forms of speech, such as [...] "Señor" [...] or [...] "Don", were abandoned.

That's awesome, she's freaking Janet Jackson." [...] Jackson contacted Kahn directly to direct the video, saying [...] "I was star struck on Janet for sure, {{because that was the}} <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> really dealt with someone that was in my youth. I studied Janet Jackson videos growing up. So to finally see myself face to face with her and working with her and her calling me on a first name basis and calling my home and tracking me down on my cell phone… like her leaving messages, it was the weirdest thing." [...] Kahn continued [...] "And Janet, she really is elegant, she’s like royalty. Even though she’s talking to you and trying to be normal, she’s not – she’s Janet Jackson – and you can never get that out of your head. You realize that she’s a real person and she’s got just the same emotions as everyone else, but you can never get around the fact that she’s special." ...|$|E

5000|$|Before then, though, Killigrew would {{generate}} some more excitement of his own, {{by being the}} first to stage plays with actresses, instead of actors, playing female roles.

40|$|Elevated {{expression}} of the helix-loop-helix protein, Inhibitor of Differentiation (Id 1), is common in human cancer and is associated with tumour progression. Id 1 has a well-defined role to dimerize with differentiation-specific basic HLH factors to regulate their transcriptional activities. Recently, {{it has been shown}} to co-localize and interact with centrosomes at interphase and mitosis suggesting a role in tumour progression through interfering with centrosome homeostasis. We report here <b>that</b> over{{expression of}} <b>Id</b> 1 induces multiple mitotic defects in cells characterized by increases in centrosome numbers, multipolar spindles, mono-astral spindles, distorted microtubules. Long term expression of Id 1 induced aneuploidy and polyploidy in a telomerase immortalized nasopharyangeal epithelial cell line. These abnormal phenotypes overlaps with the mitotic defects induced by overexpression of Aurora kinase A, a crucial regulator of mitosis. We reported for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>Id</b> 1 could induces Aurora A expression. NF-κB activation is involved in Id 1 induced Aurora A expression. Suppression of expression of Id 1 or overexpression of Aurora A could rescue centrosome homeostasis and restore microtubule integrity. These observations support a role of Id 1 in centrosome homeostasis and microtubule integrity; and contribute to chromosome instability in premalignant cells where Id 1 is often overexpressed and facilitate their transformation into malignant cells...|$|R
