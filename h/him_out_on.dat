5|$|After {{his release}} from the Jaguars, the Chicago Bears worked out Kafka on October 25, 2013, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers worked <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> November 5, the Atlanta Falcons worked <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> November 19, and the Dallas Cowboys worked <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> February 6, 2014. He signed with the Buccaneers on February 10. During {{training}} camp, Kafka competed against Alex Tanney for the third-string quarterback spot behind Josh McCown and Mike Glennon. Kafka went 2-of-7 for 14yards in the first preseason game, 4-of-11 for 55yards and a touchdown in the second preseason game, and 7-of-14 for 86yards and a touchdown in the fourth preseason game. He was released during final roster cuts with Tanney on August 30, 2014, but was subsequently re-signed to the team's practice squad on August 31. After spending {{the first three weeks}} of the season on the practice squad, Kafka was promoted to the active roster on September 25 due to an injury suffered by starter McCown. He was active but did not play in the first three weeks he was on the active roster. He was declared inactive in week 8 with McCown healthy again, and he was waived on October 28. He was re-signed to the practice squad on October 30. At the conclusion of the 2014 NFL season, Kafka's practice squad contract expired and he was not re-signed by the team.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the threat}} of imprisonment, Mysterion unmasks himself, showing the {{television}} viewers only the portion of his face that looks similar to almost all of Mr. Garrison's 4th grade class. The crowd, however, is shocked to learn Mysterion's identity and, much to the regret of all except Coon, who says that he knew who Mysterion was, even calling <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> it at one point (though this helps the audience little as Cartman claimed that practically everyone in his class was Mysterion at times), Mysterion is hauled to prison. With Professor Chaos, General Disarray and Mysterion defeated, Cartman now perceives {{that he is the}} superhero in South Park and that every town should have a Coon like him.|$|E

5|$|The Kansas City Chiefs and Green Bay Packers {{reportedly}} had {{interest in}} signing Kafka immediately {{after his release}} from the Eagles. The New England Patriots worked Kafka out on September 4, and the Pittsburgh Steelers worked <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> November 20. The Patriots signed him to a reserve/future contract on January 4, 2013, after he sat out the entire 2012 regular season. Kafka was expected to compete with Ryan Mallett for the backup job behind Tom Brady, but he was released on June 10 in favor of newly signed Tim Tebow.|$|E
5|$|Natasha {{spends more}} time with Ed and attends a comic swap with him. Shortly before a press conference for the app, Ed finds an error and he and Natasha work {{together}} to fix it. While they are celebrating, Natasha and Ed almost kiss. Andrew asks Natasha {{to talk to a}} blogger about the app without Ed, which she thinks is wrong. When Ed learns what has happened, he accuses Natasha and Andrew of using him. Natasha tries to apologise, but Ed insists that she and Andrew pay him for his help and then they can go their separate ways. Ed and Natasha eventually make up and she asks <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a date. Andrew reveals that an offer as been made for the app, but Natasha refuses to sell it. During a car journey to the city with her friends, Natasha learns that Andrew faked her signature to sell the app behind her back and an argument breaks out. Andrew tries to stop Natasha from calling the police and he bumps Chris' arm, causing him to lose control of the car and crash. Natasha frees herself from the car, before pulling Ed from the wreckage.|$|E

5|$|While {{this style}} {{facilitated}} his solid defensive play, it inhibited {{him as a}} stroke player and made him susceptible to hand and arm injuries. Such injuries would be common throughout his career. One such injury almost required {{the tip of a}} broken finger to be amputated. He was occasionally vulnerable to left-arm bowlers, either due to his inability to adjust his line of stroke or because during his career there were few fast left-hand bowlers for him to practise against in the nets. Boycott himself disputes this. In spite of that, he was never vulnerable to any one particular bowler. Pace bowler Dennis Lillee was the most successful against him in Test matches, with seven dismissals. Gary Sobers also dismissed him seven times, but Lillee did so in fewer matches. Peter Lever, a Test colleague, discussed with Boycott his vulnerability when playing the hook stroke, which was to get <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> more than one occasion. Overall in Test cricket, 54% of Boycott's dismissals were by being caught, with lbw and bowled taking 14% and 16% respectively. Boycott was an occasional medium-pace inswing bowler. He was never a genuine all-rounder, but took seven wickets at Test level at an average of 54.57, often bowling wearing his cap turned back-to-front to assist his vision.|$|E

25|$|During the stops, Hill got by Alesi with Häkkinen {{getting ahead}} of Coulthard. Häkkinen closed up on Berger {{but was unable to}} pass. Although it began to rain on lap 40, still there were no major changes at the top, with the top 6 {{remaining}} unaltered. On lap 62, Häkkinen's engine blew up, putting <b>him</b> <b>out.</b> <b>On</b> the last lap, Barrichello and Blundell were fighting for sixth when they collided, with Blundell beached in the gravel trap and Barrichello dropping behind Fittipaldi and Lehto. Fittipaldi was, however, disqualified for an underweight car, giving sixth to Lehto. Schumacher won ahead of Hill, Alesi, Berger, Coulthard and Lehto.|$|E
25|$|On lap 323, Edwards, who was 150 laps {{down at the}} time, was angered {{enough with}} the {{previous}} contact with Keselowski to desire revenge. Edwards got retaliation for his incident with Keselowski a lap later by spinning <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the front stretch. Keselowski turned airborne, barrel-rolled once (despite both roof flaps on his car deploying), and crashed on the driver's side door on the catch-fence. The crash was instantly described by NASCAR on Fox commentators Mike Joy and Darrell Waltrip as being eerily similar to the finish of the 2009 Aaron's 499 at Talladega the year before, when Keselowski turned Edwards into the catch fencing in the tri-oval on the last lap to win the race, causing Edwards to get airborne.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{started the}} day slowly as the Indian pace pair of R. P. Singh and Sharma bowled accurately. After a short rain delay, the Australians began {{to seize the}} {{initiative}} and soon wiped out their first innings deficit. Approaching lunch, Jaques was out to Kumble after a lofted sweep went to the fielder on the fence. Ponting came to the crease but was caught at silly point off the first ball he faced from Harbhajan, sparking major celebrations among the Indians, including two half-commando rolls from Harbhajan. After lunch, Hayden and Hussey rebuilt Australia's innings with the former scoring another hundred. Ponting acted as his runner due to an injury he collected while batting. Hayden was eventually dismissed by Kumble for 123 while attempting a reverse sweep. The very next ball Kumble claimed Clarke for a golden duck. Clarke stood his ground as he was caught at slip off the glove, and only walked after the umpire had given <b>him</b> <b>out.</b> <b>On</b> a hat trick, Kumble hit Symonds on the pads sparking a loud appeal which was turned down. Symonds and Hussey saw Australia to stumps with a healthy lead.|$|E

25|$|Lugard {{returned}} to Karonga in October where, on 28 November, he met an envoy of Sultan of Zanzibar, Khalifa bin Said, who claimed suzerainty over Swahili communities in East and Central Africa. The envoy failed to convince Mlozi {{and his associates}} {{to reach a settlement}} and, in December, hostilities resumed with a Swahili attack on the Chilumba stockade, which Lugard had repaired and garrisoned the previous month. This attack failed and Lugard decided to ensure that Mlozi evacuated his strongholds or to force <b>him</b> <b>out.</b> <b>On</b> 16 January 1889, he took delivery of a 7-pounder gun and gave Mlozi an ultimatum to depart by 31 January. After the ultimatum expired, Lugard, with a force of nine Europeans armed with rifles, around 250 Africans, most armed with antiquated muskets, and the gun, attacked one Swahili stockade on 14 February and another on 13 March. Although the field gun caused casualties, its shells did not destroy either stockade. Shortly after the second failure, Lugard left Karonga, leaving Blantyre on 9 April and arriving at Zanzibar on 3 May 1889 on route to Britain. Six European African Lakes Company employees and an unknown number of armed Africans remained in Karonga, and there was stalemate as neither the company nor the Swahili traders could expel the other. The company’s failure to expel Mlozi and the other hostile traders put an end to its political claims to become a chartered company with a protectorate over this area.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, CSKA {{earned a}} place in the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League's group stage after {{defeating}} Dynamo Moscow in the qualifying round and drew Roma, Basel and Fulham in the group stage. The first match was against Fulham in Sofia, where CSKA took the lead thanks to a beautiful goal by newly signed from Chernomoretz Burgas Brazilian Michel Platini. However, a simple goalkeeper mistake {{at the end of the}} match allowed Fulham to score, ending the game in a 1–1 draw. Despite the strong start, CSKA did not manage to earn any more points in the group stage and exited the competition after finishing fourth in its group. In November 2009, coach Luboslav Penev threatened to resign following a squabble with the club's management after they had reversed his decision to reprimand several players for disciplinary reasons, but decided to carry on with the job. Their disagreements eventually boiled over in January 2010 and the board relieved Penev of the position. Reports in the press pointed to former CSKA coach Miodrag Ješić as a possible replacement, but even though Ješić expressed a desire to come back to CSKA, his current contract with Libyan club Alittihad Tripoli ruled <b>him</b> <b>out.</b> <b>On</b> 17 January, the club retained Romanian specialist Ioan Andone as coach. Andone brought two Romanian players with him and set out to overhaul the team. However, over the next six matches, CSKA won only two matches, drew arch-rivals Levski 0–0 and lost second place to Lokomotiv Sofia. On 30 March, after two months on the job, Andone resigned, citing family reasons. Former CSKA defender Adalbert Zafirov was put in his place. At the same time, the club turned to Dimitar Penev again, naming him supervisor of the coaching staff. Despite the tumultuous second half of the season, CSKA managed to finish at second place in the table, behind champions Litex, and prepared to enter the third qualifying round of the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League.|$|E
