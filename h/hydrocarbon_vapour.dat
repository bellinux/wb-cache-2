5000|$|Inert gas is {{produced}} on board crude oil carriers (above 8,000 tonnes)(from Jan 1, 2016) by using either a flue gas system or by burning kerosene in a dedicated inert gas generator.

IG keeps the oxygen content of the tank atmosphere below 5% (on crude carriers, less for product carriers and gas tankers), thus making any air/hydrocarbon gas mixture in the tank too rich (too high a fuel to oxygen ratio) to ignite. IG is most important during discharging and during the ballast voyage when more <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>vapour</b> {{is likely to be}} present in the tank atmosphere.

A focus here is whether existing groundwater monitoring wells screened across the water table can be sampled to yield representative indicators of soil gas composition. For the first time, we provide multi-phase, multi-component computational simulations to address this. We simulated high and low gas extractions rate strategies to sample the gas phase over short and extended screening intervals across the water table. We investigated the options against a field data set representative of typical <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>vapour</b> profiles, inclusive of major gases, oxygen and carbon dioxide. We also evaluated the sampling options for uniform and non-uniform multi-component gasoline LNAPL distributions, including hazardous chemicals. Less sensitivity to the sampling option was observed for depth-wise increasing concentration profiles with a near-constant concentration across the screen. Significant discrepancy between the ratio of different compounds in the sample and in-situ (real) values was observed for high-rate gas extraction (particularly for an extended-screen). Low-rate gas extraction provided satisfactory results for all the scenarios. Shorter screening slightly improved the accuracy of this option.

40|$|Two fuels {{were burned}} in {{electrically}} heated beds of alumina sand, fluidised by air. The fuels were: (i) paraffin wax, {{which is a}} solid containing 100 % volatile matter and (ii) glycerol, a liquid, whose potential as a fuel needs assessing. The bubbling fluidised beds were held in the range 400 – 900 °C. Pieces of paraffin wax burned like a plastic, so when fed {{on top of a}} bed, the wax floated and generated clouds of soot. Soon, it then sank into the bed. When the sand was below ~ 800 °C, combustion occurred noisily in exploding bubbles leaving the bed. In beds hotter than ~ 800 °C, combustion proceeded in bubbles fairly low in the bed and was controlled by the mixing of <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>vapours</b> (from the wax) with the fluidising air. If wax were fed half way up a bed, bubbles of <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>vapours</b> were quickly produced; they ascended and mixed with the fluidising air. In a bed below 800 °C, combustion mainly occurred noisily in bubbles just after leaving the bed, but in a hotter bed, there was quieter burning in smaller bubbles, before they {{reached the top of the}} bed. Glycerol behaved similarly, when fed into the middle of a bed. Thus bubbles of glycerol vapour were formed; they mixed with air ascending the bed as either bubbles or percolating between particles. Again bubbles exploded noisily at the top of a bed below 800 °C. With the bed above 800 °C, glycerol burned inside smaller bubbles below the bed’s upper surface. No soot was observed when burning glycerol in such a hot bed, yielding CO and CO$_ 2 $ as the only products of combustion. It appears that burning glycerol cleanly in a hot fluidised bed is a feasible proposition...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of long-duration blast loads on the structural response of aluminium cylindrical shell structures. Full scale coupled non-linear dynamics are examined experimentally {{at one of the}} worlds’ most powerful air blast testing facilities. Evaluating structural response to blast loads of this magnitude is exceptionally difficult using only computational fluid dynamics; typically not achievable without incurring unmanageable solution domains. Clearing, diffraction and exhaust of a long-duration blast wave across any comparatively small structure imposes constraints leading to the use of approximated drag coefficients, designed primarily to expedite the calculation of net translational forces. In this research, detailed pressure histories measured experimentally {{on the surface of the}} cylindrical shell are used to accurately configure a computational analysis dispensing with the requirement to utilise approximated drag forces. When further combined with accurate material test data, fibre optic controlled strain gauge instrumentation and high-speed video photography, a full comparative model was possible. This paper shows that without exact knowledge of long-duration flow-field effects a priori, it is very difficult to reliably determine the mode of structural response and degree of blast resistance. Preliminary modelling predicted a global sway and localised plate buckling; however, subsequent experimental testing showed a crushing failure of the shell before any translational movement occurred.

A detailed non-linear numerical model comprising remapped Lagrangian analysis examines localised plate buckling and deformation. The relative computational accuracy of an uncoupled numerical model developed in this paper is compared with experimental results obtained {{at one of the}} worlds’ most powerful air blast testing facilities. Evaluating structural response for blast loads with an extended dynamic pressure phase is exceptionally difficult using only Eulerian controlled CFD methods; due to domain constraints incorporating restrictive cell sizes engulfing the target structure before remapping. The further complexity of shock transmission through a structure damped by an internal fluid is examined experimentally. Fibre optic controlled instrumentation and high speed photography provide a vital insight towards coupled flow-field behaviour of the shell structure. Surface mounted pressure gauges on the cylindrical wall accurately record the pressure time history throughout the passage of the shock wave. This paper highlights the key influence on blast response due to varying internal fluid levels and the relative importance pertaining to a conservative design solution for varying operational states. Numerical modelling in this paper demonstrates the robust accuracy achievable for a remapped Lagrangian solution. The routine analytical assumption of uniform drag forces acting on the structural body was shown to be both misleading and inaccurate by comparison.

The {{physical and chemical properties}} of the co-ordination polymer, 5, 5 '-methylenebis (N- hexadecylsalicylidenamine), at the air water interface were investigated using Brewster angle microscopy and surface pressure versus area measurements. Langmuir-Blodgett films were built-up on a variety of substrates. The addition of copper acetate to the subphase caused a change in both the physical and optical properties of the Langmuir- Blodgett layers. Film thickness data suggest that a true monolayer (thickness ca 2 nm) is only formed under these conditions. The multilayer films were studied using X-ray diffraction, UV/Visible spectroscopy, ellipsometry, surface plasmon resonance, surface profiling and electron spin resonance. The response of each film when exposed to, benzene, toluene, ethanol and water vapours were recorded. Two optical systems were used, both based on surface plasmon resonance. The first incorporated a silicon photodiode to record the intensity of the reflected light. The second was similar to that of surface plasmon microscopy, using a charge coupled device camera to monitor the reflected light intensity from the Langmuir-Blodgett film/metal interface.

40|$|When a gas {{undergoes}} an {{exothermic reaction}} {{in a closed}} vessel, spatial temperature gradients can develop. If these gradients become sufficiently large, the resulting buoyancy forces will move the gas, i. e. {{there is a natural}} convection. The nature of the resulting flow is determined by the Rayleigh number, Ra = (βg ΔT L 3) / (κ v). The evolution of such a system will depend on the interactions of natural convection, diffusion of both heat and chemical species, and chemical reaction. This study is concerned with a gas-phase system undergoing Sal’nikov’s reaction: P → A → B, in the presence of natural convection. This kinetic scheme is used as a simplified representation of a cool flame, which is a feature of the low temperature combustion of a <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>vapour.</b> Sal’nikov’s reaction is one of the simplest to display thermokinetic oscillations, such as those seen in cool flames. The behaviour of Sal’nikov’s reaction in the presence of natural convection was investigated using a combination of analytical and numerical techniques.

Subsequently, a scaling analysis of Sal’nikov’s reaction proceeding in a spherical reactor was performed. This yielded significant insight into the general behaviour of this and similar systems.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Condensers are {{important}} class of equipment in process industry. Condensation {{is the process}} of changing vapour into liquid. Design of heat exchanger to partially or totally condense a vapour mixture is frequently necessary in the process industry. The term vapour mixture actually comprehends an entire spectrum of situation. The limit of the spectrum is a mixture in which all the component present have boiling point above the maximum coolant temperature; in this case the mixture is totally condensed. (Bell & Ghaly et al). In the present work, vertical shell and tube condenser has been designed for the condensation of <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>vapour</b> mixture containing Propane, Butane, Hexane,Heptanes and Octane in the mole composition of 0. 15, 0. 25, 0. 05, 0. 30 & 0. 25 with the help of MATLAB using Bell & Ghaly. Heat transfer area has been calculated for the different heat load by Bell and Ghaly and Kern’s design method. It is found that heat transfer surface area obtained by Kern’s method is always lesser than that obtained by Bell & Ghaly’s method. The {{reason for this is that}} Kern’s method omits the mass transfer resistance in the vapour phase. Further, the developed code has been used to study the effect of operating variable on heat transfer area, overall heat transfer co-efficient, tube side and shell side pressure drops. The overall heat transfer coefficient was found to increase with coolant flow rate and decrease with an increase in coolant inlet temperature, vapour inlet temperature and vapour flow rate. The shell-side pressure drop was found to increase with vapour flow rate where as other variables have nominal effects. Validation of the developed code has been done using the work of S. Bandyopadhyay et al. and is be to be found in good agreement. Therefore, it may be concluded that the developed code may be used for the design of a multi-component condenser where all the components can be totally condensed.

40|$|The ceramic glazing {{techniques}} of vapour glazing, reduction lustre, Raku and fuming all require specialised firing conditions {{with the use}} of potentially hazardous kiln atmospheres and specialist kiln designs for their successful execution. The technique of reduction lustre is an ancient, highly decorative technique in which pigments or glazes containing reducible metal oxides such as copper, silver and bismuth are subjected to a reducing atmosphere which results in the formation of stable iridescent lustrous colour effects. Conventionally hydrocarbons are used to produce a reducing atmosphere, the combustion of which can lead to potentially high levels of CO. This research has concentrated on the technique of reduction lustre with the aim of producing a safe, environmentally friendly firing system. Reduction lustre effects were reproduced using a 100 litre down draft gas kiln designed and constructed for the purpose. A 40 litre electric kiln was modified for use with reducing atmospheres and a laboratory muffle kiln was also adapted to provide closely controlled firing conditions. Alternative reducing atmospheres were assessed, consisting of either 5 % H 2 in N 2 or <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>vapour</b> in N 2 The former is reliable, safe, environmentally friendly and is recommended for studio pottery use. A theoretical design for a reduction lustre kiln incorporating a gas control system based on the use of a 5 % H 2 in N 2 gas mixture and a gas tight outer casing was developed. Thermoanalytical methods were used to investigate the reduction behaviour of raw materials, glazes and frits under different atmospheric conditions. Diffusional and topochemical models of reduction reactions occurring in a typical lustre glaze have been evaluated. In-glaze lustres reduce with thecharacteristics of diffusion processes. Water diffusion out of the glaze may be rate determining. Studies carried out using energy dispersive x-ray analysis andphoto electron spectroscopy show that lustres are associated with the presence of metallic copper, the actual colour being dependent on the surface concentration of the metal. The aesthetic results of the various firing methods developed were assessed using a perceptual study based on the use of a semantic differential test developed from a multiple sorting survey carried out using lustred tiles. The survey used both lustred tiles to represent a 2 -dimensional surface and lustred vases which represented a 3 -dimensional lustre glazed surface. The survey showed that statistically significant differences were observed between lustred ceramics fired in different systems, allowing comparisons to be made in an objective manner.

40|$|Surface {{diffusion}} of strongly adsorbing <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>vapours</b> on activated carbon {{was measured by}} using a constant molar flow method (D. D. Do, Dynamics of a semi-batch adsorber with constant molar supply rate: a method for studying adsorption rate of pure gas, Chem. Eng. Sci. 50 (1995) 549), where pure adsorbate is introduced into a semi-batch adsorber at a constant molar flow rate. The surface diffusivity was determined from the analysis of pressure response versus time, using a linear mathematical model developed earlier. To apply the linear theory over the non-linear range of the adsorption isotherm, we implement a differential increment method on the system which is initially equilibrated with some pre-determined loading. By conducting the experiments at different initial loadings, the surface diffusivity can be extracted {{as a function of}} loading. Propane, n-butane, n-hexane, benzene, and ethanol were used as diffusing adsorbate on a commercial activated carbon. It is found that the surface diffusivity of these strongly adsorbing vapours increases rapidly with loading, and the surface diffusion flux contributes significantly to the total flux and cannot be ignored. The surface diffusivity increases with temperature according to the Arrhenius law, and for the paraffins tested it decreases with the molecular weight of the adsorbate. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Abstract. A new curing method, {{chemical}} vapour curing (CVC) for polycarbosilane (PCS) fibers using unsaturated <b>hydrocarbon</b> (cyclohexene) <b>vapour</b> was studied. The low {{oxygen content}} SiC fibers were prepared {{and when the}} oxygen content in fibers was lower than 4. 0 %, the maximum tensile strength reached to 3. 8 GPa. The relationship between the tensile strength and the oxygen content of the fibers was investigated. The structure and composition of SiC fibers were also characterized by element analysis, FT-IR, XRD and XPS. Compared with that by air curing method, SiC fibers with less oxygen and better mechanical properties were prepared by CVC method...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a combined ultrasonic instrument for gas flow metering and continuous real-time binary gas composition measurements. The combined flow measurement and mixture analysis algorithm employs sound velocity measurements {{in two directions}} in combination with measurements of the pressure and temperature of the process gas mixture. The instrument has been developed in two geometries following extensive computational fluid dynamics studies of various mechanical layouts. A version with an axial sound path has been used with binary gas flows up to 230 l. min− 1, while a version with a sound path angled at 45 ° to the gas flow direction has been developed for use in gas flows up to 20000 l. min− 1. The instrument with the axial geometry has demonstrated a flow resolution of ≤ 1 % of full scale for flows up to 230 l. min− 1 and a mixture resolution of 3. 10 − 3 for C 3 F 8 /C 2 F 6 molar mixtures with ~ 20 %C 2 F 6. Higher mixture precision is possible in mixtures of gases with widely-differing molecular weight (mw) : a sensitivity of 1 yr) continuous study. A prototype instrument with 45 ° crossing angle has demonstrated a flow resolution of 1. 9 % of full scale for linear flow velocities up to 15 ms− 1. Although this development was motivated by a requirement of the ATLAS silicon tracker evaporative fluorocarbon cooling system, the developed instrument {{can be used in}} many applications where continuous knowledge of binary gas composition is required. Applications include the analysis of <b>hydrocarbons,</b> <b>vapour</b> mixtures for semi-conductor manufacture and anaesthetic gas mixtures...|$|R
