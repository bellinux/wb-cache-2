40|$|Abstract. A new dry {{cleaning}} methodology named laser shock cleaning and optical inspection technique {{has been applied}} not only to remove <b>the</b> particles <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> of image sensors but also to inspect <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> automatically {{before or after the}} cleaning. In the packaging of CMOS and CCD image sensing modules, the particles generated during the assembly process should be removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> of image sensors in order to ensure clear image as well as to enhance the yield. The different kinds of particles were removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> by <b>the</b> laser shock cleaning technique which utilizes the airborne shock wave induced by intense laser pulse. For the quantitative evaluation of cleaning performance, number, shape and size of the particles on <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> of image sensors were measured by vision inspection technique before and after cleaning. It was found that most particles on <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> were successfully removed after the treatment of laser-induced shock waves. The average removal efficiency of the particles was over 95 %. It is interestingly found that the remaining particles after the cleaning are based on organics, which are probably attached during the bonding process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Based on the FEM {{analysis}} of the distributions and varieties of the stresses and the strains of the large-size dissimilar steel welded tube-plate structure under cyclic loading, the fatigue crack initiation sites of this structure were predicted. The low-cycle fatigue test was performed to verify the prediction and to study the cracks propagating paths as well. The {{results indicated that the}} weld toes linked to <b>the</b> two <b>surfaces</b> of <b>the</b> plate were the positions with the peak values of the maximum stress and the stress amplitude. The plastic deformations in the first loading cycle introduced the tensile-compressive repeated stress cycle at the weld toes during the subsequent loading cycles. It induced the fatigue cracks initiating at the weld toes linked to <b>the</b> two <b>surfaces</b> of <b>the</b> plate respectively. After initiating <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>the</b> cracks propagated along the fusion lines with a short distance then turn into the base metal in the sections vertical to <b>the</b> <b>surfaces.</b> <b>The</b> depth of <b>the</b> crack initiating <b>from</b> <b>the</b> compressed <b>surface</b> was shorter than <b>the</b> one <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tensioned <b>surface.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|Because it is {{difficult}} to achieve local drug activity following administration by the conventional intravenous and oral routes, I sought to develop a new route of administration utilizing drug absorption <b>from</b> <b>the</b> liver <b>surface</b> in order to target that organ. Although direct application to <b>the</b> liver <b>surface</b> should yield local drug distribution, drug absorption <b>from</b> <b>the</b> liver <b>surface</b> has not been reported in the literature. Therefore, we analyzed, as a model, the efficiency of absorption of several organic anions and dextrans of various molecular weights following application to <b>the</b> rat liver <b>surface</b> in vivo using a cylindrical diffusion cell. Each compound appeared gradually in the plasma, followed by excretion into the bile and/or urine, indicating the possibility of drug absorption <b>from</b> <b>the</b> liver <b>surface.</b> <b>The</b> absorption process <b>from</b> <b>the</b> liver <b>surface</b> may not involve a specific transport system because dose and transport inhibitors had no detectable effect. In addition, molecular weight was found to be a determinant of absorption through <b>the</b> liver <b>surface.</b> <b>The</b> efficiency of targeting desired region in the liver was enhanced considerably by application to <b>the</b> liver <b>surface,</b> compared to intravenous administration. Moreover, I have obtained several promising results <b>from</b> <b>the</b> application of this new drug delivery system to anticancer drugs and gene therapy.
