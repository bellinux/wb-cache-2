5000|$|On July 29, 2014, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia {{ruled on}} Sisel vs. HHS.

Scott Garrett (R-NJ) issued a {{statement}} {{on behalf of the}} Caucus regarding the ruling. The statement was: The judges got it wrong. According to the Supreme Court, ObamaCare is constitutional because it’s a tax, and there’s <b>just</b> <b>no</b> other <b>way</b> to put it. Consequently, per the Constitution, the Origination Clause must be followed. The Origination Clause states that revenue raising bills must start in the House of Representatives. It is a plain and simple fact that ObamaCare originated in the Senate. Therefore, if the court wished to follow precedent, it should have thrown the law out. What we have now, instead, is a convoluted attempt—by a packed court—to justify the complete obfuscation of a very simple Constitutional clause. I look forward to the Supreme Court promptly reviewing this ruling. If allowed to stand, this precedent would create a whole new exception to the Origination Clause that would eviscerate the requirements that all measures which tax the people must come from the people’s house.|$|R

40|$|The term “connectome” is {{commonly}} taken {{to describe a}} complete map of neural connections in a nervous system of a given species. This chapter provides a critical perspective {{on the role of}} connectomes in neuroscientific practice and asks how the connectomic approach fits into a larger context in which network thinking permeates technology, infrastructure, social life, and the economy. In {{the first part of this}} chapter, we argue that, seen from the perspective of ongoing research, the notion of connectomes as “complete descriptions” is misguided. Our argument combines Rachel Ankeny's analysis of neuroanatomical wiring diagrams as “descriptive models” with Hans-Jörg Rheinberger's notion of “epistemic objects,” i. e., targets of research that are still partially unknown. Combining these aspects we conclude that connectomes are constitutively epistemic objects: there <b>just</b> is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to turn them into permanent and complete technical standards because the possibilities to map connection properties under different modeling assumptions are potentially inexhaustible. In the second part of the chapter, we use this understanding of connectomes as constitutively epistemic objects in order to critically assess the historical and political dimensions of current neuroscientific research. We argue that connectomics shows how the notion of the “brain as a network” has become the dominant metaphor of contemporary brain research. We further point out that this metaphor shares (potentially problematic) affinities to the form of contemporary “network societies. ” We close by pointing out how the relation between connectomes and networks in society could be used in a more fruitful manner...|$|R
