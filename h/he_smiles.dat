Simón tells Laura that his wish was for her to stay {{and take care of}} the orphans, she then happily tells them a story. Sometime later, Carlos visits a memorial to Laura, Simón and the orphans. Carlos returns to the orphans' old bedroom and finds a medallion that he had given to Laura. He turns to look as the door opens, and <b>he</b> <b>smiles.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some months later, {{the town}} has {{constructed}} a statue of the Giant in its memory, friendship, and heroism, and Dean and Annie are starting a relationship. Hogarth receives a package from Rogard, a bolt from the Giant being the only remnant they could find. That night, Hogarth sees the bolt trying to move on its own, and he opens the window, letting the bolt roll free. The bolt joins many other parts as they converge on the Giant's head on the Langjökull glacier in Iceland. The Giant's head activates, and <b>he</b> <b>smiles</b> as he puts itself back together.|$|E
5|$|Kelly {{admits to}} some problems, while making excuses for her boyfriend, {{such as his}} busy {{schedule}} and her own moodiness. Beyoncé, however, rolls her eyes at the thin excuses, and assures Kelly that she and Michelle love her and she does not need not to suffer alone. At this, Kelly begins to cry and laugh at the same time. Michelle goes on to tell her of the day she confronted her boyfriend {{when she saw him}} browsing through jewelry with another woman. During the last minute of the video, Kelly can seen be seen looking cold and angry as her boyfriend comes home. He arrives apologetic, but she perks up, dangling a pair of fuzzy handcuffs. <b>He</b> <b>smiles</b> and begins to follow her upstairs. In the following scene, he is naked except for a pair of boxers (in some versions, his rear-end is blurred out) and handcuffed to the balcony. With her bags packed and the handcuff key in hand, she leaves—laughing happily leaving her partner shocked and angry. The girls are finally seen walking down the city street, holding hands, as an image of the album cover of Destiny Fulfilled passes by on a city bus.|$|E

25|$|In a {{surprise}} reveal at the ending, a bearded, much older looking Eddie is shown alive, watching the ending credits of Foley's documentary tribute {{to him and}} the band roll {{through the window of}} an appliance store. <b>He</b> <b>smiles</b> serenely, proud to know that his work is finally being heard, and then disappears into the night.|$|E
25|$|On Sunday morning, California police, {{who have}} been {{tracking}} Kowalski's movements on an electronic wall-map, set up a roadblock with two bulldozers {{in the small town}} of Cisco, where Kowalski will be passing. A small crowd gathers at the roadblock. As Kowalski approaches at high speed, <b>he</b> <b>smiles</b> as he crashes into the bulldozers in a fiery explosion.

500|$|After his death, 9413's spirit {{leaves his}} body and is pulled by a {{platform}} into the sky.

60|$|It must be {{admitted}} that Jack was rather anxious, {{although he did}} his best to conceal it. <b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> at Captain Glasby, who <b>smiled</b> back. Then <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> at Lieutenant Harkness, but that under-officer only favored him with a scowl.|$|R
60|$|He {{had spoken}} his last words. <b>He</b> <b>smiled,</b> and I {{understood}} his touch {{to mean that}} he wished to lift my hand, and lay it on his breast. I laid it there, and <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> again, and put both his hands upon it.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> darkly {{upon her}} from his great height. She was so frail a body and so old that surely {{it was not}} worth a man's while to {{sacrifice}} her {{on the altar of}} revenge. But not so thought Colonel Penruddock. Therefore <b>he</b> <b>smiled.</b>|$|R
500|$|Grant's {{appeal was}} unusually broad, among {{both men and}} women; Kael remarked that men wanted to be him and women dreamed of dating him. She noticed that Grant treated his female co-stars {{differently}} {{to most of the}} leading players at the time, regarding them as subjects with multiple qualities rather than [...] "treating them as sex objects". For writer David Shipman, he seemed to meet the requirement for every figure to aspire to be, whether it was an uncle, best friend or lover, and [...] "more than most stars he belonged to the public". A number of critics have argued that Grant had the rare star ability to turn a mediocre picture into a good one. Philip T. Hartung of The Commonweal in his review for Mr. Lucky (1943) stated that if it [...] "weren't for Cary Grant's persuasive personality the whole thing would melt away to nothing at all". For McCann Hollywood had [...] "found its ideal gentleman, a gentleman for a democratic culture. He was an amalgam of tradition and modernity, wealth and virtue, elite and mass, high and low, great and good". He states that Grant's delivery should [...] "not have worked, but somehow it did", commenting: [...] "As he sits and faces the camera during that early scene in The Awful Truth, he looks at us with an expression that suggests he knows as well as we do that the audacious trick has, against all the odds, actually come off. <b>He</b> <b>smiles</b> at us, sharing with us his extraordinary good fortune. <b>He</b> <b>smiles</b> a smile like Gatsby's smile." [...] Political theorist C. L. R. James saw Grant as a [...] "new and very important symbol", a new type of Englishman who differed from the Leslie Howard and Ronald Coleman gentleman types, who represented the [...] "freedom, natural grace, simplicity and directness which characterise such different American types as Jimmy Stewart and Ronald Reagan", which ultimately symbolized the growing relationship between Britain and America.|$|E
500|$|References to Shaun of the Dead {{are also}} present in the film. In one scene, Nicholas wants to chase a {{shoplifter}} by jumping over garden fences; however, Danny is reluctant. Nicholas says, [...] "What's the matter, Danny? You never taken a shortcut before?" [...] <b>He</b> <b>smiles</b> assuredly before jumping over {{three in a row}} (according to the DVD commentary, Pegg vaulted over three fences, and a stunt man did a back flip over the fourth). When Danny attempts it, he trips and falls through the fence. This is almost identical to a scene in Shaun of the Dead, including the fall-through-fence gag, albeit with the pratfalling role reverse: in Shaun of the Dead it happens to Pegg's character rather than Frost's, and he falls over the fence rather than through it. The DVD commentary says that Frost purposely looked back at the camera after crashing through the fence, to show that he had done the stunt rather than someone else.|$|E
500|$|When Lester {{is caught}} masturbating by Carolyn, his angry retort about {{their lack of}} {{intimacy}} {{is the first time}} he says aloud what he thinks about her. By confronting the issue and Carolyn's [...] "superficial investments in others", Lester is trying to [...] "regain a voice in a home that [...] the voices of mother and daughter". His final turning point comes when [...] Angela and he almost have sex; after she confesses her virginity, he no longer thinks of her as a sex object, but as a daughter. He holds her close and [...] "wraps her up". Mendes called it [...] "the most satisfying end to [...] journey there could possibly have been". With these final scenes, Mendes intended to show Lester at the conclusion of a [...] "mythical quest". After Lester gets a beer from the refrigerator, the camera pushes toward him, then stops facing a hallway down which he walks [...] "to meet his fate". Having begun to act his age again, Lester achieves closure. As <b>he</b> <b>smiles</b> at a family photo, the camera pans slowly from Lester to the kitchen wall, onto which blood spatters as a gunshot rings out; the slow pan reflects the peace of Lester's death. His body is discovered by Jane and Ricky. Mendes said that Ricky's staring into Lester's dead eyes is [...] "the culmination of the theme" [...] of the film: that beauty is found where it is least expected.|$|E
60|$|<b>He,</b> too, <b>smiled.</b> <b>He</b> was a small, stout, red-faced little man, and <b>he</b> {{possessed a}} <b>smile</b> that rarely failed to set strangers at their ease. Many strenuous {{years on the}} New York Stock Exchange had not {{destroyed}} a certain childlike amiability in Mr Birdsey, and it shone out when <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> at you.|$|R
60|$|He {{stared at}} her, {{and to her}} amazement <b>he</b> <b>smiled.</b> <b>He</b> spoke as one who remarks upon a quite {{unexpected}} fact....|$|R

500|$|Vikram {{signed on}} to {{collaborate}} again with Shankar for I, a romantic thriller opposite Amy Jackson, in early 2012. Following hushed production developments, {{it was revealed that}} the actor would sport four significantly different looks in the film: a body builder, a beast, a model and a hunchback. He put on weight to portray the bodybuilder, sticking to a diet of protein and coffee, to ensure his muscles are defined on screen. Vikram subsequently lost weight to portray a model, before shaving his head and reducing his weight to 56 kilograms to portray the crippled hunchback. He changed his physique by eating small meals of egg whites and apples instead of regular food intakes, while engaging in an intensive weight loss regime to become thin. The cast and crew of the film reportedly struggled to recognise the actor at times, while he also stayed away from the media for close to a year when sporting the look. Taking almost three years for production, Vikram described the film [...] "as the toughest he has ever done" [...] and regularly suffered folliculitis {{as a result of the}} prosthetic make-up he had to wear. The film opened amidst much expectation in January 2015 to mixed reviews, though critics gave Vikram's portrayal of Lingesan, unanimously positive reviews. A critic from Times of India noted [...] "Vikram bowls you over with a heart-wrenching performance whether he is handsome or disfigured", while The Hindu added his transformation was [...] "laudable", and that [...] "Vikram wins hearts as the earnest-to-boot gym rat and as the strapping new model on the block, he floors the audience with his performance as Koonan, the deformed hunchback". Similarly Rediff.com noted the actor [...] "is truly impressive and deserves much applause", while Sify.com added he [...] "lived the role". Despite mixed reviews, I performed well at the box office, as well as becoming the most successful Tamil film of all time in Kerala. He then worked on Vijay Milton's road-thriller, 10 Enradhukulla (2015), which featured him as an unnamed race driver who goes on a road trip through India. Paired opposite Samantha, the film opened to mixed reviews and did not perform well at the box office. A critic from Sify.com however noted Vikram [...] "breathes life to his role and his energy level is highly infectious", adding that [...] "the way <b>he</b> <b>smiles,</b> dances and fight is a treat for his fans". Likewise a critic from The Hindu criticised the film's script adding [...] "it's hard to see Vikram in this fluff". Vikram later appeared in Iru Mugan, a science fiction action film directed by Anand Shankar, featuring him alongside Nayantara and Nithya Menen.|$|E
2500|$|Henry Winkler said [...] "You've got {{incredible}} judges, Simon {{speaks the}} truth, I always agree with him.

2500|$|The stark lyrics by Vedder for [...] "Even Flow" [...] {{describe}} {{the experience of}} being a homeless man. The subject sleeps [...] "on a pillow made of concrete" [...] and panhandles passersby for spare change. In addition to being illiterate, he may also be mentally ill, as he [...] "looks insane" [...] when <b>he</b> <b>smiles</b> and struggles to keep coherent thoughts ("Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies/Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away").|$|E

As if desirous of the cross <b>he</b> <b>smiles</b> and holds it firm, and is unwilling to yield it to his Mother who seems to want to takeit away from him." ...|$|E
2500|$|James [...] "Jamie", Jr. – 33 years old, {{the older}} son. He has {{thinning}} hair, an aquiline nose and {{shows signs of}} premature disintegration. He has a habitual expression of cynicism. He resembles his father. [...] "On the rare occasions when <b>he</b> <b>smiles</b> without sneering, his personality possesses the remnant of a humorous, romantic, irresponsible Irish charm – the beguiling ne'er-do-well, with a strain of the sentimentally poetic". He is attractive to women and popular with men. He is an actor like his father but has difficulty finding work due to {{a reputation for being}} an irresponsible, womanizing alcoholic. He and his father argue a great deal about this. Jamie often refers to his father as [...] "Old Gaspard", a character from the opera Les cloches de Corneville, who is also a miser.|$|E
2500|$|In that context, {{the protests}} against the Long Island {{hospital}} built with migrant labor can be seen for what they were: resistance outside of the Jim Crow South to black workers. During this time, complaints about black workers taking federal construction jobs appear sporadically through the legislation history of both prior bills that anticipated Davis-Bacon, and Davis-Bacon itself. On {{the floor of the}} House of Representatives, Congressman Upshaw said: [...] "You will not think that a southern man is more than human if <b>he</b> <b>smiles</b> over the fact of your reaction to that real problem you are confronted with in any community with a superabundance or large aggregation of negro labor." [...] U.S. Congressman John J. Cochran (D-Missouri) reported that he had [...] "received numerous complaints in recent months about southern contractors employing low-paid colored mechanics getting work and bringing the employees from the South". U.S. Congressman Clayton Allgood (D-Alabama) reported on [...] "cheap colored labor" [...] that [...] "is in competition with white labor throughout the country".|$|E

2500|$|Huey Freeman (voiced by Regina King) – [...] 10-year-old Huey Freeman is the family's {{moral compass}} and voice of reason. He is an intelligent, wise-beyond-his-years avid reader who is {{knowledgeable}} about {{a variety of}} subjects. He is heavily influenced by the theories of various left-wing social movements and social justice leaders. His brother and grandfather constantly ridicule and underestimate him, thinking he is a fool to have goals and values that aim higher than the expectations of mainstream American culture. It's mentioned {{that he has been}} declared a [...] "domestic terrorist". While he promotes various social causes, he is openly contemptuous of Urban Gangster Rap/Hip Hop as portrayed in mainstream media for glamorizing wasteful extravagance, self-defeating lifestyles, and ignorance. Huey, unlike the other characters, rarely smiles; in the episode [...] "Let's Nab Oprah" [...] <b>he</b> <b>smiles</b> after his duel with Riley; he also smiles when Riley begins to win basketball games in [...] "Ballin'". He is a highly skilled kung-fu fighter, and beats Riley with ease in all of their fights. He has only lost to a few opponents.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1783, young Napoleon Buonaparte (Vladimir Roudenko) is {{enrolled}} at Brienne College, a military school for sons of nobility, run by the religious Minim Fathers in Brienne-le-Château, France. The boys at the school are holding a snowball fight organized as a battlefield. Two bullies—Philippeaux (Petit Vidal) and Peccaduc (Roblin)—schoolyard antagonists of Napoleon, are leading the larger side, outnumbering the side that Napoleon fights for. These two sneak up on Napoleon with snowballs enclosing stones. A hardened snowball draws blood on Napoleon's face. Napoleon is warned of another rock-snowball by a shout from Tristan Fleuri (Nicolas Koline), the school's [...] and a friend to Napoleon. Napoleon recovers himself and dashes alone to the enemy snowbank to engage the two bullies in close combat. The Minim Fathers, watching the snowball fight from windows and doorways, applaud the action. Napoleon returns to his troops and encourages them to attack ferociously. He watches keenly and calmly as this attack progresses, assessing {{the balance of the}} struggle and giving appropriate orders. <b>He</b> <b>smiles</b> as his troops turn the tide of battle. Carrying his side's flag, he leads his forces in a final charge and raises the flag at the enemy stronghold.|$|E
2500|$|The next day, Lisa {{is invited}} by Juliet {{to run away}} to a {{run-down}} restaurant where they intend to live while they complete their writing. Lisa misses her Model UN meeting, {{where she was going}} to represent Azerbaijan. Martin contacts Marge and tells her about Lisa's disappearance. Marge immediately goes looking for Lisa, but cannot find her. Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney, who use the restaurant as their hideout, find and trap Lisa and Juliet. They tie them up, then (apparently having untied them off-screen) lock them in cages. Dolph and Jimbo leave, and the girls escape by distracting Kearney with stories about Equalia. Dolph and Jimbo try to destroy the girls' manuscripts, but Kearney now believes in the idea of Equalia and attacks them -- in his mind he becomes a dragon and overcomes them, but in reality Dolph and Jimbo are beating him up while <b>he</b> <b>smiles</b> dreamily and obliviously. Lisa and Juliet escape. Later, Lisa tells Juliet that she wants to continue living in the real world and forget about Equalia. Juliet feels disappointed that Lisa feels this way and decides to abandon the friendship, claiming that [...] "the real world is for people who can't imagine anything better" [...] (causing Lisa to conclude that Juliet is crazy).|$|E
