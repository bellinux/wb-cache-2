5|$|Skin & Bone is a 1996 American drama film. It is {{the story}} of three Los Angeles-area hustlers, or male prostitutes, and their female pimp.

Ghislane, the pimp, sends each of the three young men into increasingly dangerous scenarios with clients, until both Billy and Harry are killed. The film stars B. Wyatt as Harry, Alan Boyce as Dean, Garret Scullin as Billy and Nicole Dillenberg as Ghislaine.|$|E
5|$|The {{fire spread}} {{quickly in the}} high wind and, by mid-morning on Sunday, people {{abandoned}} attempts at extinguishing it and fled. The moving human mass and their bundles and carts made the lanes impassable for firemen and carriages. Pepys took a coach back into the city from Whitehall, but only reached St Paul's Cathedral before he had to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> walk. Pedestrians with handcarts and goods {{were still on the}} move away from the fire, heavily weighed down. The parish churches not directly threatened were filling up with furniture and valuables, which soon had to be moved further afield.|$|E

As Burns {{goes off to}} get some {{champagne}} to celebrate, Snake comes to rob the bowling alley, and is surprised to see Gloria, who {{turns out to be}} his ex-girlfriend. Despite Gloria's protests, Snake kidnaps her and Homer. When Burns finds Gloria's ring, dropped in the commotion, he assumes she ran off with Homer. Snake takes Gloria and Homer to his hideout. Though Gloria says she loves Burns, Snake vows he can change. The police arrive and confront Snake. Homer tries to escape but instead sets Snake's house on fire. Snake and Homer <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> Burns runs in to save Gloria, however he is soon overcome by the smoke and Gloria is then seen carrying him to safety. Although initially grateful, Gloria begins to reminisce about Snake, causing her to break up with Burns and become Snake's girl again.|$|E

5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. Before qualifying began on Saturday afternoon, Mercedes was forced to change the power unit in Nico Rosberg's car back to the one used in Belgium, which had already run for six full races, after finding an issue with the new specification unit. Meanwhile, Lotus was forced to borrow tyre blankets from other teams, as their own had been rendered unusable by rain during the night. When the session began, Nico Hülkenberg {{was one of the first}} out on track, but his fast lap was disrupted by Marcus Ericsson, who was later penalised for the incident. Both Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen spent most of the session in the pit lane. While Ricciardo was able to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> set a lap sufficient to see him proceed to the second part of qualifying (Q2), Verstappen went out only to see his engine cover blown off at Curva Grande, scattering the track with debris, though at the very end of the session, so no other cars were affected. Next to Verstappen, both Manor Marussia and McLaren drivers were eliminated.|$|E

25|$|The England cricket team {{arrived in}} Australia in late-October {{looking to get}} the tour {{off to a good}} start but, the Chairman's XI were more than a match for them. Chris Lynn was loaned to WA by Queensland, {{overlooked}} for their Sheffield Shield clash being played at the same time. This move paid off as Lynn made a blistering 104, only his third first-class century as each of WA's top four batsmen made half centuries. England's fast-bowling trio of Chris Tremlett, Boyd Rankin and Steven Finn struggled for line and length on the WACA wicket and Chairman's XI declared at 5-451. England began to fight back however as Michael Carberry made 78 and both Jonathan Trott and Ian Bell made centuries, the former didn't <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> made 113 and the latter retired on 115. England were eventually bowled out for 391 and half-centuries to Mitchell Marsh and Lynn meant that the game ended in a draw.|$|E
25|$|If {{a player}} is in jail, {{they do not}} take a normal turn and must either pay a fine of $50 to be released, use a Chance or Community Chest Get Out of Jail Free card, or attempt to roll doubles on the dice. If a player fails to roll doubles, they lose their turn. Failing to roll doubles in three {{consecutive}} turns requires the player to either pay the $50 fine or use a Get Out of Jail Free card, after which they move ahead according to the total rolled. Players in jail may not buy properties directly from the bank, due to being unable to move, but can engage all other transactions, such as mortgaging properties, selling/trading properties to other players, buying/selling houses and hotels, collecting rent, and bidding on property auctions. A player who rolls doubles to leave jail does not roll again; however, if the player pays the fine or uses a card to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> then rolls doubles, they do take another turn.|$|E

500|$|During Adams' tenure, {{the college}} {{acquired}} a new mascot, {{the first since}} the original Reveille died in 1944. Reveille II, like the original Reveille, was cared for and attended to by band members. During halftime performances, the young dog was allowed {{to be on the}} field with the band without her leash. During these breaks where she could <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> run, she had a tendency to [...] "do her business" [...] on Kyle Field's playing surface. This didn't bother the band members much, as Reveille stayed away from the band, but Adams discovered a gambling scheme whereby cadets were taking bets on what yardline the dog would defecate. He quickly ended the practice and turned the responsibility of caring for Reveille over to Company E-2, which has since been called the Mascot Company.|$|E
500|$|In fall 1941 the Nazis began {{transporting}} Jews {{out of the}} ghetto. Most {{of these}} were sent to Belzec extermination camp and killed. On 13 March 1943 the ghetto was liquidated and those still fit for work {{were sent to the}} new concentration camp at Płaszów. Several thousand not deemed fit for work were sent to extermination camps and killed. Hundreds more were killed on the streets by the Nazis as they cleared out the ghetto. Schindler, aware of the planned action because of his Wehrmacht contacts, had his workers stay at the factory overnight to prevent them coming to any harm. Schindler witnessed the liquidation of the ghetto and was appalled. From that point forward, says Schindlerjude Sol Urbach, Schindler [...] "changed his mind about the Nazis. He decided to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> to save as many Jews as he could." ...|$|E

[...] The band's manager, Kelly Curtis, stated, [...] "Once people came and saw them live, this lightbulb would go on. Doing their first tour, you kind of knew it was happening and there was no stopping it." [...] Early on in Pearl Jam's career, the band became known for its intense live performances. Looking back at this time, Vedder said that [...] "playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force...But it didn't come from jock mentality. It came from just being let out of the gates." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Dry", or [...] "Closed" [...] diving bells are {{pressure}} vessels for human occupation {{which can be}} deployed from the surface to transport divers to the underwater workplace at pressures greater than ambient. They are equalized to ambient pressure at the depth where the divers will <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> back in after the dive, and are then re-sealed for transport back to the surface, which also generally takes place with controlled internal pressure greater than ambient. During and/or after the recovery from depth, the divers may be decompressed {{in the same way}} as if they were in a decompression chamber, so in effect, the dry bell is a mobile decompression chamber. Another option, used in saturation diving, is to decompress to storage pressure (pressure in the habitat part of the saturation spread) and then transfer the divers to the saturation habitat under pressure (transfer under pressure – TUP), where they will stay until the next shift, or until decompressed at the end of the saturation period.|$|E

Audisio used the nom de guerre of [...] "Colonel Valerio" [...] during his mission. In the afternoon, he, with other partisans, including Aldo Lampredi and Michele Moretti, drove to the De Maria family's farmhouse to collect Mussolini and Petacci. After they were picked up, they drove a short distance to the village of Giulino de Mezzegra. The vehicle pulled up at the entrance of the Villa Belmonte on a narrow road known as via XXIV maggio (approximate coordinates: [...] ) and Mussolini and Petacci were told to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> stand by the villa's wall.
