At that point, conscious of time passing, she determined to <b>give</b> <b>priority</b> <b>to</b> the final securing of her father's musical legacy, and to re-establish her credentials as a composer. She relinquished her post as Britten's assistant to Rosamund Strode, although she did not leave Aldeburgh or break with Britten, continuing her work with the Aldeburgh Festival for a further 13 years.|$|E

The bomb, except for the uranium payload, was ready {{at the beginning of}} May 1945. The uranium-235 projectile was completed on 15 June, and the target on 24 July. The target and bomb pre-assemblies (partly assembled bombs without the fissile components) left Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, California, on 16 July aboard the cruiser , arriving 26 July. The target inserts followed by air on 30 July.|$|E
5|$|On 3November, the {{division}} was renamed the 6th Infantry Division. The division initially commanded rear area personnel and the 22nd Infantry Brigade. Over the coming months, the 14th and 16th Infantry Brigades {{were assigned to}} {{the division}} as they arrived in Egypt from Palestine. On 10June 1940, Italy declared war upon Britain and her allies. Seven days later, the 6th Infantry Division was dissolved and its headquarters transformed into the command staff of a corps known as the Western Desert Force (WDF). In early September 1940, Italian forces based in Libya invaded Egypt. Three months later, the WDF began a limited raid, Operation Compass. The raid succeeded and was expanded; in two months the WDF advanced , occupied the Italian province of Cyrenaica and destroyed the Italian 10th Army. The operation was halted in February 1941 to <b>give</b> <b>priority</b> <b>to</b> the Battle of Greece.|$|E

In two months, the British advanced , occupying the Italian province of Cyrenaica and destroying the 10th Army. The advance was halted in February 1941 because of supply shortages and to <b>give</b> <b>priority</b> <b>to</b> the Battle of Greece. Renamed XIII Corps and reorganised under HQ Cyrenaica Command (CYRCOM), the troops of the former Western Desert Force adopted a defensive posture. Over the next few months, HQ Cyrenaica lost its commander, Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson, followed by the 2nd New Zealand Division and the 6th Australian Division when they were sent to Greece in Operation Lustre. The 7th Armoured Division, with virtually no serviceable tanks left, was also withdrawn {{and sent to the}} Nile Delta for rest and refitting. Wilson was replaced by Lieutenant-General Philip Neame; parts of the 2nd Armoured Division and 9th Australian Division were deployed to Cyrenaica but both formations were inexperienced, ill-equipped {{and in the case of}} the 2nd Armoured Division, well under strength, after detachments to Greece.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} case {{study was to examine}} the nature of a first-year elementary teacher's specialized practices and knowledge for <b>giving</b> <b>priority</b> <b>to</b> evidence in science teaching and to explore the possible sources from which this knowledge was generated. Data included three audiotaped interviews, six videotaped classroom observations, lesson plans, and samples of students' work. The findings of this study reveal that the teacher <b>gave</b> <b>priority</b> <b>to</b> evidence by frequently engaging students in collecting evidence through observations and investigations, recording and representing evidence, and using that evidence to construct explanations. The findings of this study also illustrate that critical experiences during preparation to teach and specific university coursework acted as sources through which the teacher's specialized knowledge for <b>giving</b> <b>priority</b> <b>to</b> evidence was generated...|$|R

This represents a shift from poll results from 2001 through 2008, when clear pluralities of Americans wanted environmental concerns to take priority over developing fossil fuel resources. However, public opinion still heavily favors an emphasis on wind and solar energy (59 percent) over fossil fuels (31 percent).|$|E
25|$|Manitoba Hydro {{is unusual}} in North America {{because it is the}} sole {{commercial}} provider of electrical power in the province of Manitoba. It is a Crown corporation closely regulated by the Provincial government. This status arose because of the history of electrification in the Province, where early private commercial developers required a large initial return on investment owing to the high risks of the projects. This limited the economic benefits that electrification would bring. Manitoba Hydro is required by its regulating legislation to <b>give</b> <b>priority</b> <b>to</b> public benefit over profit.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{educational}} reform tenets, polytechnic colleges were to <b>give</b> <b>priority</b> <b>to</b> admitting secondary vocational and technical school graduates and providing on-the-job training for qualified workers.

Regular senior middle schools were to be converted into vocational middle schools, and vocational training classes were to be established in some senior middle schools. Diversion of students from academic to technical education was intended to alleviate skill shortages and to reduce the competition for university enrollment.|$|E

Bus lanes are {{a key component of}} the Select Bus Service (SBS) bus rapid transit network, improving bus travel speeds and reliability by reducing delay caused by other traffic.|$|E
