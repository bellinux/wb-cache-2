5|$|From its {{headwaters}} downstream to the downstream-most {{crossing of}} the Scranton/Moosic line, the drainage basin of Stafford Meadow Brook is designated as a High-Quality Coldwater <b>Fishery</b> and a Migratory <b>Fishery.</b> From that point downstream to its mouth, the stream is classified as a Warmwater <b>Fishery</b> and a Migratory <b>Fishery.</b> A large section of the stream from its headwaters to the lower Pennsylvania Route 307 bridge meets the criteria for an Exceptional Value designation. Wild trout naturally reproduce in the stream {{at least as far}} upstream as river mile 6.82 and as far downstream as its mouth. The stream was stocked with 500 adult and fingerling rainbow trout in 1894–1895. In 1984, the Pennsylvania Fish Commission speculated that there were native brook trout in part of the stream.|$|E
5|$|In some localities {{significant}} bait fisheries {{exist to}} supply sport fishermen. One {{study of a}} bait <b>fishery</b> in Florida that targets Hemiramphus brasiliensis and Hemiramphus balao suggests that despite increases {{in the size of}} the <b>fishery</b> the population is stable and the annual catch is valued at around $500,000.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{watershed}} of Roaring Creek is in Columbia County, but small areas are in Montour County, Northumberland County, and Schuylkill County. More than 40 percent of {{the watershed}} is forested and nearly 40 percent is agricultural land. State game lands and state forests {{are also in the}} watershed. A total of approximately 3,500 people inhabit the watershed, as of 2000. The creek's drainage basin is a High-Quality Coldwater <b>Fishery</b> and a Migratory <b>Fishery</b> upstream of Lick Run. Downstream of Lick Run, the main stem is a Trout Stocked <b>Fishery</b> and Migratory <b>Fishery.</b> A reach of the creek above Lick Run is designated as Class A Wild Trout Waters. 31 species of fish were observed at 20 sites in the watershed in 2003 and 2004.|$|E

[...] The department works toward conservation and protection of inland freshwater <b>fisheries,</b> such as on the Great Lakes and Lake Winnipeg through cooperative agreements with various provinces. Provincial governments have enacted provincial <b>fisheries</b> legislation, for the licensing of their <b>fisheries.</b> With the exception of Saskatchewan, conservation rules for freshwater <b>fisheries</b> are enacted under the <b>Fisheries</b> Act; six provinces administer these regulations in their own <b>fisheries.</b>|$|R
5|$|Pilot whales {{have also}} {{fallen victim to}} bycatches. In one year, around 30 short-finned pilot whales were caught by the squid round-haul <b>fishery</b> in {{southern}} California. Likewise, California's drift gill net <b>fishery</b> took around 20 whales {{a year in the}} mid-1990s. In 1988, 141 whales caught on the east coast of the U.S. were taken by the foreign Atlantic mackerel <b>fishery,</b> which forced it to be shut down.|$|E
5|$|Roaring Brook is {{designated}} as a High-Quality Coldwater <b>Fishery</b> and a Migratory <b>Fishery</b> for part of its length and a Coldwater <b>Fishery</b> and a Migratory <b>Fishery</b> for {{the other part of}} its length.

Numerous macroinvertebrate taxa have been observed in the stream and boreal forest trees inhabit wetlands in the watershed. A 12-mile (19-kilometer) rail trail connecting the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail to the Poconos via the Roaring Brook Corridor has been proposed.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the night shark globally as Vulnerable, citing its slow reproductive rate and historical declines under fishing pressure. It {{has also been}} listed as Vulnerable by the American Fisheries Society (AFS). This species was once {{a significant part of}} the Cuban artisanal shark <b>fishery,</b> comprising 6075% of the catch from 1937 to 1941, before its numbers dropped substantially in the 1970s. Similarly, the proportion of night sharks in the shark catch of the southeastern U.S. pelagic longline <b>fishery</b> fell from 26.1% from 1981 to 1983 to 0.33.3% in 1993 and 1994; a comparable decline was observed in catches by south Florida marlin tournaments since the 1970s. Currently, the intense Brazilian targeted <b>fishery</b> is of particular concern, although fishing pressure on the night shark may be relaxing as the <b>fishery</b> is beginning to shift towards swordfish and bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus). No <b>fishery</b> information on the night shark is available for the eastern Atlantic, leading to an IUCN assessment of Data Deficient for that region.|$|E

This paper reviews and analyzes changes in policy towards small-scale <b>fisheries</b> in Vietnam over the last two decades. The primary issues facing the small-scale <b>fisheries</b> in Vietnam are to restructure the near-shore <b>fisheries</b> and to address over-capacity.

40|$|Although <b>fisheries</b> {{management}} {{is a complex}} task, many {{countries in the world}} have managed to develop <b>fisheries</b> management regimes that can improve the economic efficiency of the <b>fisheries.</b> Property rights-based <b>fisheries</b> management regimes have shown promising results in the management of <b>fisheries</b> resources since they reduce or eliminate the incentives for over-capitalisation in harvesting of the <b>fisheries</b> resources and thus contribute to economic efficiency.
