Particle diameter was 2. 7 times smaller than the size of the emulsion droplet template indicating that the particle porosity was very low. SEM images revealed that the majority of particle pores are in the sub-micron region but in some instances these pores can reach 3 9 m in diameter. Droplet diameter was influenced by the flow rates of the two phases and the entry diameter of the collection capillary tube; droplet diameters decreased with increasing values of the flow rate ratio of the dispersed to continuous phase to reach constant minimum values at 40 - 60 % orifice diameter. At flow rate ratios less than 5, jetting can occur, giving rise to large droplets formed by detachment from relatively long jets (~ 10 times longer than droplet diameter) ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Monodisperse poly(dl-lactic acid) (PLA) {{particles}} of diameters between 11 and 121 µm were fabricated in flow <b>focusing</b> <b>glass</b> microcapillary devices by evaporation of dichloromethane (DCM) from emulsion droplets at room temperature. The dispersed phase was 5 % (w/w) PLA in DCM containing 0. 12 mM Nile red and the continuous phase was 5 % (w/w) poly(vinyl alcohol) in reverse osmosis water. Particle diameter was 2. 7 times {{smaller than the}} diameter of the emulsion droplet template indicating very low particle porosity. Monodisperse droplets have only been produced under dripping regime using a wide range of dispersed phase flow rates (0. 002 − 7. 2 cm 3 h- 1), continuous phase flow rates (0. 3 − 30 cm 3 h- 1) and orifice diameters 2 (50 − 237 µm). In the dripping regime, the ratio of droplet diameter to orifice diameter was inversely proportional to the 0. 39 power of the ratio of the continuous phase flow rate to dispersed phase flow rate. Highly uniform droplets with a coefficient of variation (CV) below 2 % and a ratio of the droplet diameter to orifice diameter of 0. 5 − 1 were obtained at flow rate ratios of 4 − 25. Under jetting regime, polydisperse droplets (CV> 6 %) were formed by detachment from relatively long jets (between 4 and 10 times longer than droplet diameter) and a ratio of the droplet size to orifice size was 2 − 5...|$|E

The disperse phase was 5 % (w/w) PLA in dichloromethane (DCM) containing small amount of nile red and the continuous phase was 5 % (w/w) poly(vinyl alcohol) in milli-Q water. The two immiscible liquids were introduced from the two ends of the same square capillary in opposite directions and both liquids were collected and exit through the inner circular capillary. The disperse phase was hydrodynamically flow focused by the continuous phase in the tapered section of the circular capillary, which caused the disperse phase to break into drops inside the collection tube. PLA particles were formed by DCM evaporation at room temperature. In order to prevent wetting of the collection tube with the disperse phase, the hydrophilicity of the glass surface was enhanced by 2 -[methoxy(polyethyleneoxy) propyl]trimethoxysilane. Experimentally, we show that the droplet size is influenced by the operating conditions and orifice size, as shown in Fig. 1. The drop formation occurs near the orifice in the dripping regime (Fig. 1 a-b) and farther downstream in the jetting regime (Fig. 1 c). The drops formed in the jetting regime are significantly bigger than those formed in the dripping regime and have a broader size distribution. postprintUK Colloids 2011 : An International Colloid and Surface Science Symposium, London, U.

40|$|A {{microfluidic}} free-flow isoelectric <b>focusing</b> <b>glass</b> chip {{for separation}} of proteins is described. Free-flow isoelectric focusing is demonstrated {{with a set of}} fluorescent standards covering a wide range of isoelectric points from pH 3 to 10 as well as the protein HSA. With respect to an earlier developed device, an improved microfluidic FFE chip was developed. The improvements included the usage of multiple sheath flows and the introduction of preseparated ampholytes. Preseparated ampholytes are commonly used in large-scale conventional free-flow isoelectric focusing instruments but have not been used in micromachined devices yet. Furthermore, the channel depth was further decreased. These adaptations led to a higher separation resolution and peak capacity, which were not achieved with previously published free-flow isoelectric focusing chips. An almost linear pH gradient ranging from pH 2. 5 to 11. 5 between 1. 2 and 2 mm wide was generated. Seven isoelectric focusing markers were successfully and clearly separated within a residence time of 2. 5 s and an electrical field of 20 V mm- 1. Experiments with pI markers proved that the device is fully capable of separating analytes with a minimum difference in isoelectric point of ∆(pI) = 0. 4. Furthermore, the results indicate that even a better resolution can be achieved. The theoretical minimum difference in isoelectric point is ∆(pI) = 0. 23 resulting in a peak capacity of 29 peaks within 1. 8 mm. This is an 8 -fold increase in peak capacity to previously published results. The focusing of pI markers led to an increase in concentration by factor 20 and higher. Further improvement in terms of resolution seems possible, for which we envisage that the influence of electroosmotic flow has to be further reduced. The performance of the microfluidic free-flow isoelectric focusing device will enable new applications, as this device might be used in clinical analysis where often low sample volumes are available and fast separation times are essential. ...|$|E
