50|$|There is {{an example}} of a safe harbor {{decision}} in reference to the EU Data Protection Directive. The Directive sets comparatively strict privacy protections for EU citizens. It prohibits European firms from transferring personal data to overseas jurisdictions with weaker privacy laws. Five years later, a <b>decision</b> <b>created</b> <b>exceptions</b> where foreign recipients of the data voluntarily agreed to meet EU standards under the International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles. In October 2015, following a court decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union, the safe harbor agreement between the EU and US was declared invalid on the grounds that the US was not supplying an equally adequate level of protection against surveillance for data being transferred there.|$|R

50|$|The Act {{was aimed}} at {{regulating}} businesses. However, its application {{was not limited to}} the commercial side of business. Its prohibition of the cartel was also interpreted to make illegal many labor union activities. This is because unions were characterized as cartels as well (cartels of laborers). This persisted until 1914, when the Clayton Act <b>created</b> <b>exceptions</b> for certain union activities.|$|R

40|$|Last Term the Supreme Court {{rendered}} {{its decision}} in Atlantic Coast Line Railroad v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers. This case involved the present anti-injunction statute, section 2283 of Title 28, which forbids federal court injunction of state court proceedings.

Mr. Justice Black went on to announce that the anti-injunction statute is absolute; no judicially <b>created</b> <b>exceptions</b> are to be allowed. This Commentary will argue that the 1793 legislation in which the anti-injunction provision first appeared does not indicate that the provision enjoyed a fundamental constitutional base. Further, it will be argued that the Court 2 ̆ 7 s view that section 2283 is not subject to judicially <b>created</b> <b>exceptions</b> is itself subject to limits...|$|R
