40|$|Derivatives {{products}} provide certain {{important economic}} {{benefits such as}} risk management or redistribution of risk away from risk-averse investors towards those more {{willing and able to}} bear risk. Derivatives also help price discovery, i. e. the process of determining the price level for any asset based on supply and demand. These functions of derivatives help in efficient capital allocation in the economy; at the same time their misuse also poses a threat to the stability of the financial sector and the overall economy. In the mid- 1990 s India started reviving the <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> <b>commodity</b> derivatives market and introduced a variety of instruments in the foreign exchange derivatives market, while exchange traded financial derivatives were intro-duced in 2001.

50|$|The bid-offer spread is an {{accepted}} measure of liquidity costs in <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> securities and <b>commodities.</b> On any standardized exchange, two elements comprise {{almost all of}} the transaction cost—brokerage fees and bid-offer spreads. Under competitive conditions, the bid-offer spread measures the cost of making transactions without delay. The difference in price paid by an urgent buyer and received by an urgent seller is the liquidity cost. Since brokerage commissions do not vary with the time taken to complete a transaction, differences in bid-offer spread indicate differences in the liquidity cost.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTABSTRACT Commodity {{transactions}} and commodity exchanges in the Czech Republic The object of this thesis is <b>trading</b> <b>commodities</b> on the organised {{markets in the}} Czech republic. The diploma thesis {{is divided into three}} chapters. The first concentrates on the characteristics of basic terms such as exchange with its historic development and functions, commodity as the subject of <b>exchange</b> <b>trades</b> and organised <b>commodity</b> market. The second chapter describes briefly main types of <b>exchange</b> <b>trades</b> and principles of trading with the futures and options contracts on the future exchange. The third chapter is divided into three parts. The first deals with the legal aspects of commodity exchanges in the Czech republic including the outline of legislation existing in different periods of the czech history. Second concentrates on current commodity exchanges, its basic characteristics and trading mechanisms. The last represents the complex evaluation of {{the current state of the}} commodity exchange from the legal and economic point of view and the outline of its perspectives in following years.

40|$|In 2003, <b>trading</b> of <b>commodity</b> futures {{shifted from}} single commodity, {{regional}} exchanges to national <b>exchanges</b> that <b>trade</b> multiple <b>commodities.</b> This paper examines price discovery and hedging effectiveness of commodity futures after this change and concludes that,on average, futures prices do discover information relatively efficiently,but helps to manage risk less efficiently. The paper uses {{the viewpoint of}} the hedger to conjecture what factors may improve hedging effectiveness. These include high settlement costs caused by few and widely dispersed delivery centers and an unreliability of warehouse receipts,a mismatch between the grade specified in the futures contract and what is available for delivery in the market, and disruptions caused by various policy interventions in both commodities spot and futures markets...|$|R

50|$|OTC trading, {{as well as}} <b>exchange</b> <b>trading,</b> {{occurs with}} <b>commodities,</b> {{financial}} instruments (including stocks), and derivatives of such products. Products <b>traded</b> on the <b>exchange</b> must be well standardized. This means that exchanged deliverables match a narrow range of quantity, quality, and identity which {{is defined by the}} exchange and identical to all transactions of that product. This is necessary for there to be transparency in trading. The OTC market does not have this limitation. They may agree on an unusual quantity, for example. In OTC market contracts are bilateral (i.e. contract between only two parties), each party could have credit risk concerns with respect to the other party. OTC derivative market is significant in some asset classes: interest rate, foreign exchange, stocks, and commodities.|$|R

40|$|Commodity {{options are}} {{the right to buy}} or sell a {{specified}} quantity of a commodity, or commodity futures contract, at a specified price. The publicity surrounding several "boiler room" scams involving unwary buyers has given commodity options a bad name. Currently, only a handful of firms sell legitimate commodity options. Commodity options can, however, offer social benefits not provided by other investment vehicles. For example, they have several advantages over futures contracts. Their prices reflect information more quickly and fully than the prices of futures contracts. They allow investors to eliminate the risk of margin calls by paying an option "premium" up front. They allow producers and investors to hedge quantity, as well as price, risk for seasonal crops; using futures contracts, a farmer can form a perfect riskless hedge only if he knows exactly how much of a commodity he will have after a future harvest. Furthermore, the distribution of returns on options, which ensures that only the premium is lost regardless of how much futures prices fall, may attract to commodity option markets investors who need to hedge their assets against volatile fluctuations in price. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the <b>Commodity</b> Futures <b>Trading</b> Commission have recently moved to allow <b>exchange</b> <b>trading</b> of <b>commodity</b> options. Organized <b>exchange</b> <b>trading</b> may be expected to increase trading in, hence expand the social benefits of, <b>commodity</b> options. <b>Exchange</b> <b>trading</b> might also improve price "efficiency" in option markets. Tests using a variant of the Black-Scholes formula for option pricing indicate that, under the current system of private firm market-making, commodity option prices do not always accurately reflect all available information...|$|R

5|$|To sustain this {{military}} machine and meet other state expenses, {{large amounts of}} revenue were necessary. Greater Poland had some natural resources used for trade, such as fur, hide, honey and wax, but those surely did not provide enough income. According to Ibrahim ibn Yaqub, Prague in Bohemia, a city built of stone, was the main center for the <b>exchange</b> of <b>trading</b> <b>commodities</b> {{in this part of}} Europe. From Kraków, the Slavic traders brought tin, salt, amber and whatever other products they had, most importantly slaves; Muslim, Jewish, Hungarian and other traders were the buyers. The Life of St. Adalbert, written {{at the end of the}} 10th century by John Canaparius, records the fate of many Christian slaves sold in Prague as the main curse of the time. Dragging of shackled slaves is shown as a scene in the bronze 12th-century Gniezno Doors. It may well be that the territorial expansion financed itself by being the source of loot, of which the captured local people were the most valuable part. The scale of the human trade practice is arguable, however, because much of the population from the defeated tribes was resettled for agricultural work or in the near-gord settlements, where they could serve the victors in various capacities and thus contribute to the economic and demographic potential of the state. Considerable increase of population density was characteristic of the newly established states in eastern and central Europe. The slave trade not insufficient to meet all revenue needs, the Piast state had to look for other options.|$|R
40|$|The Canadian {{experience}} with a floating exchange rate regime can {{shed some light on}} the question of whether A question of current interest in many parts of the world is whether with growing economic integration among groups of countries makes a fixed exchange rate, or even a common currency, becomes more desirable. This paper looks at the lessons that one may draw from tThe Canadian experience, with a floating exchange rate regime, especially since the inception of the 1989 U. S. -Canada Free Trade Agreement, suggests. We find that exchange rate flexibility has not prevented economic integration between Canada and the United States from increasing substantially, during the 1990 s, and has played a useful role in buffering the Canadian economy against asymmetric external shocks. A fixed exchange rate thus does not seem to be a prerequisite for economic integration. It may, however, yield substantial have benefits for some countries that lack monetary credibility or that may be tempted by self-destructive beggar-thy-neighbor policies.

Forecasting {{the number of students}} expected to enroll in a college is therefore of prime importance to the management for both tactical and strategic management. This can be based on the available historical data and use of time series prediction. Students' enrolment time series can be predicted with a certain degree of confidence. This is from analyzed data. Future activities can be determined from the past performances. In this project, a short forecast will be used. This is because a shorter forecast gives a more accurate result with a higher degree of confidence. So far, the primary means of detecting trends and patterns has involved statistical methods such as statistical clustering and regression analysis. The mathematical models associated with these methods for economical forecasting, however, are linear and may fail to forecast the turning points in economic cycles because in many cases the data they model maybe highly nonlinear. In the contemporary generation in computing, new methodologies, including neural networks, knowledge-based systems and genetic algorithms, has attracted attention for analysis of trends and patterns.
