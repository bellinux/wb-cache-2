As Skinner and Scully monitor the operation from a van, Mulder and the other agents slowly close in on Haley. Haley hands an envelope to another man (Armin Moattar) before escaping. The agents discover that the man's flesh has been eaten away by an unknown toxin.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Cooper was re-elected, {{securing}} {{his first}} full, six-year {{term in the}} Senate. Newly elected President John F. Kennedy– Cooper's former Senate colleague– chose Cooper to conduct a secret fact-finding mission to Moscow and New Delhi. Following Kennedy's assassination in November 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Cooper to the Warren Commission to investigate the assassination. Cooper soon became an outspoken opponent of Johnson's decision to escalate U.S. military involvement in the Vietnam War, consistently advocating negotiation with the North Vietnamese instead. After Cooper's re-election in 1966, he worked with Idaho Democrat Frank Church {{on a series of}} amendments designed to de-fund further U.S. military operations in the region. These amendments were hailed as the first serious attempt by Congress to curb presidential authority over military operations during an ongoing war. Aging and increasingly deaf, Cooper did not seek re-election in 1972. His last acts of public service were as Ambassador to East Germany from 1974 to 1976 and as an alternate delegate to the United Nations in 1981. He died <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C., retirement home on February 21, 1991, and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, Kaine ran for {{governor}} of Virginia against Republican candidate Jerry W. Kilgore, a former state attorney general.

Two polls released in September 2005 showed Kaine trailing Kilgore—by four percentage points <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Washington</b> Post poll and by one percentage point in a Mason-Dixon/Roanoke Times poll.

Among the plaintiffs named in the lawsuit are Saadallah Ali Belhas and his son Ali Saadallah Belhas who lost 31 family members in the shelling including their respective wives and 12 children. The United States District Court dismissed the complaint in 2006 on the basis that Yaalon was entitled to immunity under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. The United States Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia affirmed the dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Dana {{made the}} Sun a Democratic newspaper, {{independent}} and outspoken in {{the expression of}} its opinions respecting the affairs of either party. His criticisms of civil maladministration during General Grant's terms as president led to a notable attempt {{on the part of}} that administration, in July 1873, to take him from New York on a charge of libel, to be tried without a jury <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Washington</b> police court. Application was made to the United States District Court in New York for a warrant of removal, but in a memorable decision Judge Blatchford, later a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, refused the warrant, holding the proposed form of trial to be unconstitutional. Perhaps {{to a greater extent than}} in the case of any other conspicuous journalist, Dana's personality was identified in the public mind with the newspaper that he edited.|$|E

500|$|In 1986, Signithia Fordham co-authored with Nigerian {{sociologist}} John Ogbu a {{study that}} concluded that high-performing African-American students <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C., high school borrowed from hegemonic white culture {{as part of a}} strategy for achievement, while struggling to maintain a black identity. Ogbu made a related claim in his 2003 book, Black American Students in an Affluent Suburb: A Study of Academic Disengagement, concluding that black students' own cultural attitudes sometimes hindered academic achievement and that these attitudes are too often neglected. Ogbu had earlier written in his seminal work Minority Education and Caste (1978), that school disengagement among caste-like minorities occurs because white society limits the job-success of their parents and others in their communities by a glass ceiling. In his new book, he said that non-whites [...] "failed to observe the link between educational achievement and access to jobs." ...|$|E
500|$|Thomas Wenzlau's {{presidency}} (1968–1984) {{began with}} the challenge of campus unrest: Ohio Wesleyan students took over the ROTC building, demanded its shut-down, and eventually eliminated ROTC in 1970. Students also demanded participation in departmental meetings and faculty committees, and the democratic process in the governance of Ohio Wesleyan grew in this period. Wenzlau's presidency witnessed decline in students' test scores, an unusually high attrition rate, lack of adequate research to identify potential major donors and a growing [...] "party school" [...] image, leading to a rocky relationship between him and the student body. Between 1979 and 1982, the campus newspaper The Transcript frequently criticized Wenzlau's presidency, blaming it for [...] "severely affecting the reputation of the college".

[...] The film was exhibited across the United States, and over 300 prints were produced. In the weeks preceding the screening, local presenters sought {{to attract the attention}} of the town's inhabitants by distributing letters to local newspapers and church leaflets protesting against the film's moral basis.
