5|$|The {{field in}} which the hoard was {{discovered}} was shown by the 1994 excavation to probably have been cleared by the early Bronze Age, when it began {{to be used for}} agriculture and settlement. Some settlement activity occurred near the hoard findspot by {{the first half of the}} first millennium BC, but there is no evidence of Roman buildings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>vicinity.</b> The field where the hoard was deposited may have been in cultivation during the early phase of the Roman period but the apparent absence of fourth-century coins suggests that it may have been converted to pasture or else had reverted to woodland by that time.|$|E
5|$|The {{second line}} ran a mile closer to Warsaw, {{along the lines}} of {{partially}} preserved First World War-era trenches built by German and Russian armies in 1915, separated by a no man's land.

The two most prominent pivots of this line were the towns of Radzymin and Wołomin.

5|$|Within 90 {{years of}} Osman I's {{establishment}} of the Ottoman beylik, Byzantine Asia Minor had ceased to exist and by ca. 1380, Byzantine Thrace was lost to the Ottomans. By ca. 1400, the once mighty Byzantine Empire {{was nothing more than}} a collection of the Despotate of the Morea, a few Aegean islands and a strip of land in Thrace <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>vicinity</b> of the Capital. The Crusade of Nicopolis in 1396, Timur's invasion in 1402 and the final Crusade of Varna in 1444 allowed a ruined Constantinople to stave off defeat until 1453.

5|$|After {{a pair of}} Tiger {{possessions}} {{that ended}} with punts and an Alabama possession that ended with a lost fumble by McCarron, the Crimson Tide started their fourth scoring drive of the afternoon. The drive began with a 22-yard McCarron pass to Christion Jones and finished with a 15-yard Yeldon touchdown run. Immediately after Yeldon scored, the referees stopped the game temporarily and cleared the field due to lightning strikes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>vicinity</b> of the stadium. After a 40-minute stoppage, the game resumed with a Jeremy Shelley extra point and a Crimson Tide lead of 28–0. Missouri responded on the kickoff that ensued with their only touchdown of the afternoon on a 98-yard Marcus Murphy return that made the halftime score 28–7.|$|E
5|$|Luminosity {{has been}} {{reported}} in the past and is probably due to misidentification of external light sources such as lightning, city lights, and power flashes from broken lines, as internal sources are now uncommonly reported and are not known to ever have been recorded. In addition to winds, tornadoes also exhibit changes in atmospheric variables such as temperature, moisture, and pressure. For example, on June 24, 2003 near Manchester, South Dakota, a probe measured a 100 mbar (hPa) (2.95 inHg) pressure decrease. The pressure dropped gradually as the vortex approached then dropped extremely rapidly to 850 mbar (hPa) (25.10 inHg) in the core of the violent tornado before rising rapidly as the vortex moved away, resulting in a V-shape pressure trace. Temperature tends to decrease and moisture content to increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>vicinity</b> of a tornado.|$|E
30|$|Small-scale hydromodification {{temporarily}} {{increased the}} turbidity {{as a result}} of increased sediment input, approaching the maximum level for clean water (5  NTU). Benthic macroinvertebrate communities declined <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> downstream <b>vicinity</b> of construction but are expected to recover soon given that turbidity recovered to pre-construction levels, and DO increased. These outcomes emphasize that environmental assessment is important not only for large-scale hydromodification but also for smaller scale stream modifications.|$|R
