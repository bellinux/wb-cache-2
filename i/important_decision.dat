5|$|A second <b>important</b> <b>decision</b> {{in which}} Owsley was a {{participant}} {{was the case}} of Blair, etc. v. Williams, which invalidated the Kentucky Replevin Act of 1820. This law granted debtors a two-year grace period in repaying their debts unless their creditors would accept notes from the Bank of Kentucky. Owsley and his colleagues opined that this law was in violation of the Contract Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The decision was extremely unpopular with the Commonwealth's citizens, but it was re-affirmed by the court's opinion in the related case of Lapsley v. Brashcars and Barr.|$|E
5|$|Once a field {{had been}} selected, an observing {{strategy}} {{had to be}} developed. An <b>important</b> <b>decision</b> was to determine which filters the observations would use; WFPC2 is equipped with forty-eight filters, including narrowband filters isolating particular emission lines of astrophysical interest, and broadband filters useful {{for the study of}} the colours of stars and galaxies. The choice of filters to be used for the HDF depended on the 'throughput' of each filter—the total proportion of light that it allows through—and the spectral coverage available. Filters with bandpasses overlapping as little as possible were desirable.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{faced the}} most <b>important</b> <b>decision</b> of his career: to prevent {{reinforcement}} at Fort Sumter or {{to let it}} take place. He and his cabinet decided to demand that the Federal garrison surrender and, if this was refused, {{to use military force}} to prevent reinforcement before the fleet arrived. Major Anderson did not surrender. With Jefferson Davis's endorsement, Beauregard began the bombarding of the fort in the early dawn of April 12. The Confederates continued their artillery attack on Fort Sumter until it surrendered on April 14. No one was killed in the artillery duel, but the attack on the U.S. fortress meant the fighting had started. President Lincoln called up state militia to march south to recapture Federal property. In the North and South, massive rallies were held to demand immediate war. The Civil War had begun.|$|E

5|$|In view {{of growing}} labor shortages, on July 1, 1944 the War Manpower Commission made an <b>important</b> <b>decision,</b> ruling that {{from then on}} all hiring of male {{employees}} in the country was to be done through the United States Employment Service (USES). By that time the USES followed strict anti-discrimination employment practices. The PTC management finally gave in and within a week posted notices about available skilled positions that {{would be open to}} all applicants, regardless of race. The company accepted eight black applicants (three from the USES and five from its own ranks) to train as streetcar coachmen. Their training was to take place in late July, and they were to start taking an empty streetcar on the lines from August 1. It was that impending trial run of the streetcars by the eight black trainees that finally triggered the strike.|$|E
5|$|After Darlington {{bought the}} {{railroad}} bridge from the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, {{he made his}} intentions with the five decade-old bridge clear. He took out the tracks, replacing them with a paved roadway. Darlington knew the automobile was becoming a big entity in the 1910s and 1920s, turning the bridge into a vehicular bridge was an <b>important</b> <b>decision</b> {{to make the most}} out of the crossing. He also figured that the bridge would make a good approach for drivers coming to visit the local natural attractions, such as the Delaware Water Gap and the Pocono Mountains. Darlington created new roadway approaches (Lackawanna Road and Ferry Lane) to the bridge and even two buildings on the New Jersey side of the span. One building was for toll collecting while the other was for living quarters. These quarters were soon occupied by Edward McCracken and his wife. McCracken and his wife had come from the Meyer's Ferry, a local ferry service running at that point on the Delaware since the early 18th century. McCracken had been the local ferry operator, but when a large accident occurred during a dinner break killed four passengers, the owner put the ferry under his control and later fired McCracken. Klein later sold the ferry, which Darlington bought and shut down. He immediately hired the McCrackens to work as the toll collectors.|$|E

25|$|Summers' {{brother had}} {{enlisted in the}} United States Army at the {{beginning}} of World War II. But Summers, opposed to the use of force, declared himself a conscientious objector. The Illinois State Bar Association admitted he was of high moral character and exhibited excellent knowledge of the law, but denied him admission in 1942 due to his conscientious objector status. In a highly controversial but <b>important</b> <b>decision,</b> the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the denial of admission to the bar in In re Summers, 325 U.S. 561 (1945). Summers later was admitted to the New York State Bar Association.|$|E

25|$|The Romanian royal court, army, and {{administration}} were subsequently forced to retreat into Moldavia, the last portion of territory still under Romanian control. Henceforth, Antonescu {{took part in}} an <b>important</b> <b>decision</b> involving defensive efforts, an unusual promotion which probably stoked his ambitions. In December, as Prezan became the Chief of the General Staff, Antonescu, who was by now a major, was named the head of operations, {{being involved in the}} defense of Moldavia. He contributed to the tactics used during the Battle of Mărășești (July–August 1917), when Romanians under General Alexandru Averescu managed to stop the advance of German forces under the command of Field Marshal August von Mackensen. Antonescu lived in Prezan's proximity {{for the remainder of the}} war and influenced his decisions.|$|E
25|$|A-Eon Technology is {{a privately}} funded company co-founded by Trevor Dickinson. The focus of A-Eon {{was on the}} {{high-end}} and a partnership with Hyperion Entertainment was formed to allow discussion with key AmigaOS 4 developers about what such a next generation AmigaOS 4 computer would need. With {{the end of the}} AmigaONE line from Eyetech and lack of success porting the OS to third party machines, A-Eon decided to continue the AmigaONE line themselves with more up to date technology. One <b>important</b> <b>decision</b> made during this early phase was that the AmigaOne X1000 should be a complete system built around a bespoke motherboard with a customised case and peripherals. This contrasts with the adapted reference design strategy used by Eyetech for the original AmigaOne series.|$|E

25|$|The {{selection}} of the scaffold material {{is perhaps the most}} <b>important</b> <b>decision</b> to be made. It must be biocompatible and biodegradable; in addition, it must be able to incorporate any physical, chemical, or biological cues desired, which in the case of some chemical cues means that it must have a site available for chemically linking peptides and other molecules. The scaffold materials chosen for nerve guidance conduits are almost always hydrogels. The hydrogel may be composed of either biological or synthetic polymers. Both biological and synthetic polymers have their strengths and weaknesses. It {{is important to note that}} the conduit material can cause inadequate recovery when (1) degradation and resorption rates do not match the tissue formation rate, (2) the stress-strain properties do not compare well to those of neural tissue, (3) when degrading swelling occurs, causing significant deformation, (4) a large inflammatory response is elicited, or (5) the material has low permeability.|$|E
25|$|Lý Nhân Tông's reign {{is highly}} applauded, above all in {{national}} education. Following the emperor's order, the first imperial examination of a Vietnamese monarch based on Confucian learning was {{organized in the}} second month in 1072 with Lê Văn Thịnh becoming the first first-rank laureate {{in the history of}} imperial examinations in Vietnam. Afterwards Lê Văn Thịnh was promoted to the position of chancellor in 1086. However the new Chancellor soon lost his position in 1096 after a controversial case of treason, was stripped of all titles, and banished. ref name=Tran42/> Besides Lê Văn Thịnh, Mạc Hiển Tích was also a capable official who found his way to the royal court from the Confucian learning that was continuously being developed by the emperor, especially after his decree establishing the first school for Confucian students in Đại Việt, Quốc tử giám (國子監, National Academy), in 1076. In 1089 Lý Nhân Tông made another <b>important</b> <b>decision</b> when he reformed the ranking of officials in the royal court and in the country. To protect the capital Thăng Long against floods, Lý Nhân Tông initiated the construction of the Cổ Xá Dike, one of the first dike systems in Đại Việt.|$|E
25|$|The Lý Dynasty issued several edicts {{during the}} early years of Lý Anh Tông's reign {{designed}} to lessen the more severe laws at that time. In 1142, in order to memorialize the rebellion of the Trưng sisters against the Chinese domination, Lý Anh Tông ordered the still existing Temple of Trưng sisters be built in the southern suburbs of Thăng Long. Lý Anh Tông was also considered the first emperor of Đại Việt to promote Buddhism as the state religion. Another <b>important</b> <b>decision</b> of the royal court was the military campaign against the King Jaya Harivarman I of Champa with the purpose of replacing Harivarman I with Vangsaraja, who was supported by the Lý Dynasty. In 1152, the general Lý Mông was appointed by Lý Anh Tông to command over 5,000 soldiers. Thanh Hóa and Nghệ An began the campaign which ultimately ended in defeat for the Lý Dynasty and the deaths of both Lý Mông and Vangsaraja. In 1154, to heal the broken relation with the Lý Dynasty, Jaya Harivarman I sent his daughter to Đại Việt, where Lý Anh Tông accepted her as his concubine. The decision of Lý Anh Tông was criticized by the historians Ngô Sĩ Liên and Lê Văn Hưu, who argued that instead of accepting the offer, the Emperor should have opened another campaign to punish the kingdom of Champa.|$|E

500|$|Another <b>important</b> <b>decision</b> is the {{temperature}} of fermentation. French winemakers prefer warmer fermentations (around 16-18°C) that bring out the mineral flavors in the wine while New World winemakers prefer slightly colder temperatures to bring out more fruit and tropical flavors. A small minority of Loire winemakers will put the wine through malolactic fermentation, a practice more often associated with New Zealand wines. Oak aging can have a pronounced effect on the wine, with the oak rounding out the flavors and softening the naturally high acidity of the grape.
