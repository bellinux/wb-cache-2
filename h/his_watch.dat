5|$|The {{separate}} {{paths of}} fool and strongman cross {{for the last}} time on an empty stretch of road, when Zampanò comes upon Il Matto fixing a flat tire. As Gelsomina watches in horror, the strongman strikes the clown on the head several times. Il Matto complains that <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> is broken, then collapses and dies. Zampanò hides the body and pushes the car off the road where it bursts into flames.|$|E
5|$|A second joint {{appearance}} {{took place}} in Beverly Hills. According to Nixon campaign adviser Bill Arnold, Douglas arrived late, while Nixon was already speaking. Nixon ostentatiously looked at <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> provoking laughter from the audience. The laughter recurred as Nixon, sitting behind Douglas as she spoke, fidgeted to indicate his disapproval {{of what she was}} saying; she appeared bewildered at the laughter. Douglas concluded her remarks and Nixon rose to speak again, but she did not stay to listen.|$|E
5|$|After retiring, Crozier {{served in}} the Capitals' front office. He {{eventually}} became interim general manager during the 1981–82 season after Max McNab was relieved of his duties. Crozier was also the {{head coach of the}} Capitals for one game during the season. Under <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> the Capitals picked future hall-of-famer defenceman Scott Stevens during the 1982 NHL Entry Draft. Crozier left the Capitals organization in 1983, and moved to Wilmington, Delaware, to work at MBNA Bank. Working through the ranks, he rose to the level of executive vice president and facilities manager of Worldwide Facilities and Construction.|$|E
5000|$|Perrelet sold some of <b>his</b> <b>watches</b> to a {{contemporary}} watch making luminary, Abraham-Louis Breguet around 1780 who improved upon the mechanism {{in his own}} version of the design, calling <b>his</b> <b>watches</b> [...] "perpetuelles", the French word for perpetual. They did not work reliably and Breguet stopped producing them around 1810.|$|R

5000|$|In 1908, {{he created}} the Rolex brand under which to sell <b>his</b> <b>watches,</b> and during World War I, he left England for Switzerland due to wartime tax {{increases}} levied on luxury imports. In 1920, he established Montres Rolex S.A. in Bienne. The name [...] "Rolex" [...] was given because it is easily pronounceable in many languages. It was also short enough to fit {{on the face of}} <b>his</b> <b>watches.</b> Wilsdorf ultimately moved his company to Geneva in 1919.|$|R
5|$|Brown's form {{started to}} {{deteriorate}} in 1937–38; he scored only 400 runs at 36.36 for the season. Queensland played five matches under <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> losing three, and went without victory. Of the two draws, one was washed out {{and in the}} other, Queensland hung on with two wickets in hand when time ran out. Although Brown compiled two centuries, he was only twelfth in the aggregates during an Australian season with no international tours. As a result, his selection for the 1938 tour to England was criticised in some quarters.|$|E
5|$|During <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> {{one night}} while the crew were camped on the ice, {{a small part}} of the ice floe broke away and he was only rescued due to the quick {{intervention}} of the men of the next watch who threw him a line allowing him to jump back to safety. Shackleton reported that McNish calmly mentioned his narrow escape the next day after further cracks appeared in the ice. Mrs. Chippy, the cat McNish had brought on board, had to be shot after the loss of the Endurance, as it was obvious he would not survive the harsh conditions. McNish apparently never forgave Shackleton for giving the order.|$|E
5|$|In 1952–53, South Africa's cricket {{authorities}} were hesitant {{to send their}} inexperienced team to Australia, fearing that the Test series would be uncompetitive. The Australian Board of Control's concern that—after losing money on the previous season's tour by the West Indies—the series would be another financial disaster resulted in South Africa offering an indemnity of ₤10,000 against any losses. Hassett began the season with two consecutive Sheffield Shield losses before the Tests, although he did manage 91 against South Australia before facing South Africa. He scored 123 in the return match {{later in the season}} and Victoria recorded two wins under <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> against Queensland.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to his work, Johnston himself {{has become part of}} the history of volcanic eruptions. With Harry Glicken, he is one of two volcanologists from the United States to die in a volcanic eruption. Glicken was being mentored by Johnston, who relieved Glicken of <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> at the ColdwaterII observation post 13 hours before Mount St. Helens erupted. Glicken died in 1991, eleven years later, when a pyroclastic flow overran him and several others at Mount Unzen in Japan. Despite the deaths of other volcanologists in later eruptions at Mount Unzen and Galeras, prediction methods similar to Johnston's allowed scientists to convince residents of settlements near the Mount Pinatubo volcano to evacuate, preventing thousands of deaths.|$|E
5|$|Lois has booked Cheesie Charlie's for Stewie's {{upcoming}} {{first birthday}} party and sends Peter, along with Chris, {{to drop off}} the deposit check at the restaurant. However, once they arrive, they seek {{the opportunity to play}} with all the machines, causing Peter to lose <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> in a claw machine. A little boy wins <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> which causes Peter to become angry and tries to force the watch off the child. The Manager sees this and asks Peter to leave. But once Peter shows the deposit check, he immediately apologizes and exclaims how they are very excited to host Stewie's birthday party. Peter, angered by how he was treated, states that they won't be celebrating Stewie's party there, which causes a crowd of people to circle around Manager shouting for the reservation. Peter, realizing what he has just done, immediately returns home with a poorly crafted lie in an attempt to evade Lois' aggravation which involves him saying that they are Nazis who torture, kill and kidnap people. He pretends that he's already planned an extravagant party at home so that Lois doesn't have do any work.|$|E
5|$|On {{arrival in}} England, Baker {{declined}} re-enlistment into the British Marines {{and returned to}} civilian life. Within six months he received an appointment from the Navy Board to act as civilian superintendent of convicts aboard the transport vessel Surprize, which departed for New South Wales in early 1794. A British loyalist, Baker took an immediate dislike to four of the convicts under <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> sentenced for political offences and collectively known as Scottish Martyrs. Late in the voyage he advised Surprizes captain Patrick Campbell that the Martyrs planned to mutiny and seize the vessel. Acting on Baker's word, Campbell had {{three of the four}} confined until Surprize reached Sydney Cove.|$|E

5|$|One {{plot device}} {{used in the}} pilot, Henry's pocket watch, proved to be {{difficult}} to use in subsequent episodes. In the beginning, the writers would have Henry's pocket watch fall out of his pocket so that it would not disappear {{with the rest of his}} body. It became more difficult for writers to develop believable scenarios in which Henry would lose <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> so they did not write it into the plot as frequently in later episodes.|$|E
5|$|The song debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at {{position}} 22 and thereafter declined. The track was promoted by a music video, which {{was directed by}} Marco Brambilla. The video features a long take of the camera pulling away from West. The video received positive reviews from critics and received two nominations for MTV Video Music Awards. West performed the song on Saturday Night Live, at the 2010 BET Awards, at the 2011 Coachella Music Festival, and <b>his</b> <b>Watch</b> the Throne Tour. When performing the song, West often wore clothes made from red leather. A remix of the track featuring rapper Jay-Z was released on August 20, 2010, {{as a part of}} West's weekly GOOD Fridays series.|$|E

50|$|He was a nonconformist who {{was married}} to Mary Bryers and who worked in Liverpool from 1795 to about 1827. He {{is known to have}} worked from a factory at 25 Church Street. Initially, his {{business}} traded from 26/27 Church Street and, later on, from 48/49 Church Street.

Joseph Johnson had a preference for using fully jewelled watch movements. He is credited with inventing several design improvements to the pocket watch and <b>watch</b> movement. <b>His</b> <b>watches</b> were commonly used on U.S. railroads, before the establishment of the U.S. watch industry.|$|R

5|$|When Mauser enters, Chuck flashes on <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> {{identifying}} {{him as a}} Fulcrum agent. Mauser tells Chuck that {{he knows}} that Casey and Sarah are CIA {{and that they are}} protecting an unknown asset.

At this point, it is revealed that Ned is far more competent than the hostages were led to believe, having intentionally shot Casey in the foot and separated Chuck from his handlers. Mauser threatens to shoot the hostages if Chuck does not reveal where Bryce Larkin and the government database the Intersect are. Chuck reveals to Mauser that the Intersect has been uploaded to his brain.|$|E
5|$|Although other British {{forces were}} {{deployed}} during the year, most were engaged on other operations incidental {{to the main}} Atlantic campaign, such as the expeditionary force to the Cape of Good Hope under Commodore Home Riggs Popham. In addition, a number of blockade squadrons were deployed to the major ports of the French Atlantic coast. These forces contained the French warships still at anchor in the ports and restricted the return of French warships from service at sea during the campaign. These forces included a Channel squadron under Rear-Admiral Thomas Louis, whose ships intercepted and captured a frigate of Commodore Jean-Marthe-Adrien L'Hermite's squadron on 27 September, and blockade forces off Cadiz under the distant command of Vice-Admiral Lord Collingwood and Brest under Admiral William Cornwallis. Cornwallis in particular was particularly effective: under <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> only one French ship of the line successfully entered or departed Brest harbour during the year.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, Detectives Toschi, Armstrong, and Mulanax {{question}} Arthur Leigh Allen, {{a suspect}} in the Vallejo case. Allen behaves suspiciously during the interview.

However, a handwriting expert insists that Allen did not write the Zodiac letters, even though Allen is said to be ambidextrous. Avery receives a letter threatening his life; becoming increasingly paranoid, he turns to drugs and alcohol. At one point, he shares information with the Riverside Police Department, angering both Toschi and Armstrong.

5|$|Tony wanders in {{delirium}} {{until he}} is rescued by Mr. Todd, who rules over a small native tribe in a remote clearing in the jungle. Todd nurses Tony back to health. Although illiterate, Todd owns copies of the complete works of Charles Dickens, and asks Tony to read to him.
