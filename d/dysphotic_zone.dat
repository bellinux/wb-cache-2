5|$|The {{euphotic}} zone is somewhat arbitrarily defined as {{extending from the}} surface to the depth where the light intensity is approximately 0.1–1% of surface sunlight irradiance, depending on season, latitude and degree of water turbidity. In the clearest ocean water, the {{euphotic zone}} may extend {{to a depth of}} about 150metres, or rarely, up to 200metres. Dissolved substances and solid particles absorb and scatter light, and in coastal regions the high concentration of these substances causes light to be attenuated rapidly with depth. In such areas the euphotic zone may be only a few tens of metres deep or less. The <b>dysphotic</b> <b>zone,</b> where light intensity is considerably less than 1% of surface irradiance, extends {{from the base of the}} euphotic zone to about 1000metres.

500|$|The stratum of {{the water}} column nearest {{the surface of the}} ocean (sea level) is {{referred}} to as the photic zone. The photic zone can be subdivided into two different vertical regions. The uppermost portion of the photic zone, where there is adequate light to support photosynthesis by phytoplankton and plants, {{is referred to as the}} euphotic zone (also referred to as the epipelagic zone, or surface zone). The lower portion of the photic zone, where the light intensity is insufficient for photosynthesis, is called the <b>dysphotic</b> <b>zone</b> (dysphotic means [...] "poorly lit" [...] in Greek). The <b>dysphotic</b> <b>zone</b> is also referred to as the mesopelagic zone, or the twilight zone. Its lowermost boundary is at a thermocline of , which, in the tropics generally lies between 200 and 1000metres.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} water depth, {{seasonal}} exposure, and substrate orientation on microbioero-sion were studied {{by means of}} a settlement experiment deployed in 15, 50, 100, and 250 m water depth south-west of the Peloponnese Peninsula (Greece). At each depth, an experi-mental platform was exposed for a summer period, a winter period, and about an entire year. On the up- and down-facing side of each platform, substrates were fixed to document the succession of bioerosion traces, and to measure variations in bioerosion and accretion rates. In total, 29 different bioerosion traces were recorded revealing a dominance of micro-borings produced by phototrophic and organotrophic microendoliths, complemented by few macroborings, attachment scars, and grazing traces. The highest bioerosion activity was re-corded in 15 m up-facing substrates in the shallow euphotic zone, largely driven by photo-trophic cyanobacteria. Towards the chlorophyte-dominated deep euphotic to <b>dysphotic</b> <b>zones</b> and the organotroph-dominated aphotic zone the intensity of bioerosion and the di-versity of bioerosion traces strongly decreased. During summer the activity of phototrophs was higher than during winter, which was likely stimulated by enhanced light availability du...|$|R
40|$|Four {{submersible}} dives off {{the coast}} of Bonaire (Caribbean Netherlands) and Klein Curaçao (Curaçao) to depths of 99. 5 – 242 m, covering lower mesophotic and upper <b>dysphotic</b> <b>zones,</b> yielded 52 sponge specimens belonging to 31 species. Among these we identified 13 species as new to science. These are Plakinastrella stinapa n. sp., Pachastrella pacoi n. sp., Characella pachastrelloides n. sp., Geodia curacaoensis n. sp., Caminus carmabi n. sp., Discodermia adhaerens n. sp., Clathria (Microciona) acarnoides n. sp., Antho (Acarnia) pellita n. sp., Parahigginsia strongylifera n. sp., Calyx magnoculata n. sp., Neopetrosia dutchi n. sp., Neopetrosia ovata n. sp. and Neopetrosia eurystomata n. sp. We also report an euretid hexactinellid, which belongs to the rare genus Verrucocoeloidea, recently described (2014) as V. liberatorii Reiswig & Dohrmann. The remaining 18 already known species are all illustrated by photos of the habit, either in situ or ‘on deck’, but only briefly characterized in an annotated table to confirm their occurrence in the Southern Caribbean. The habitat investigated—steep limestone rocks, likely representing Pleistocene fossil reefs—is similar to deep-water fossil reefs at Barbados of which the sponges were sampled and studied by Van Soest and Stentoft (1988). A comparison is made between the two localities, showing a high degree of similarity in sponge composition: 53 % of the present Bonaire-Klein Curaçao species were also retrieved at Barbados. At the level of higher taxa (genera, families) Bonaire-Klein Curaçao shared approximately 80 % of its lower mesophotic and upper dysphotic sponge fauna with Barbados, despite a distance between them of 1000 km, indicating high faunal homogeneity. We also preliminarily compared the shallow-water (euphotic) sponge fauna of Curaçao with the combined data available for the Barbados, Bonaire and Klein Curaçao mesophotic and upper dysphotic sponges, which resulted in the conclusion that the two faunas show only little overlap...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Remains of silicified {{microbial}} mats {{composed of}} benthic colonial coccoid cyanobacteria similar to modern entophysalidaceans and/or pleurocapsaleans {{have been identified}} in Lower Silurian black radiolarian cherts from central and southwestern Poland. Contrary to widespread views ascribing the genesis of such deposits to permanently anoxic deep-water marine environments, the abundance of benthic mats of phototrophic cyanobacteria suggests that the water–mat interface must have been located at moderate depth, most probably close to the limit of light penetration (<b>dysphotic</b> <b>zone).</b> Depending on ambient sulfide levels, the mats could intermittently perform anoxygenic (PSI) or oxygenic (PSII) photosynthesis, thriving under anoxic, oxic, or dysoxic (microaerophilic) conditions. The open marine (offshore) character of these cherts is consistent with their paleooceanographic location and with the presence of remains of such planktonic organisms as acritarchs, radiolarians, chitinozoans, and graptolites, entrapped by the cyanobacterial mats...|$|E
40|$|The main {{motivation}} for Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 310 to the Tahitian Archipelago was {{the assumption that}} the last deglacial sea-level rise is precisely recorded in the coral reefs of this far-field site. The Tahitian deglacial succession typically consists of coral framework subsequently encrusted by coralline algae and microbialites. The high abundance of microbialites is uncommon for shallow-water coral reefs, and the environmental conditions favouring their development are still poorly understood. Microbioerosion patterns in the three principal framework components (corals, coralline algae, microbialites) are studied with respect to relative light availability during coral growth and subsequent encrustation, in order to constrain the palaeobathymetry and the relative timing of the encrustation. Unexpectedly for a tropical, light-flooded setting, ichnotaxa typical for the deep-euphotic to <b>dysphotic</b> <b>zone</b> dominate. The key ichnotaxa for the shallow euphotic zone are scarce in the analysed sample set, and are restricted tothe baseof thedeglacial succession, thus reflecting thedeglacial sea-level rise. At the base of the deglacial reef succession, the ichnocoenoses present in the corals indicate shallower bathymetries than those in the encrusting microbialites. This is in agreement with radiocarbon data that indicate a time gap of more than 600 years between coral death and microbialite formation. At the top of the deglacial reef succession, in contrast, the microbioerosion patterns in the three framework components indicate a uniform palaeobathymetry, and radiocarbon ages imply that encrustation took place shortly after coral demise. An enigma arises {{from the fact that the}} ichnocoenoses imply photic conditions that appear very deep for zooxanthellate coral growth. During the deglacial sea-level rise increased nutrients and fluvial influx may have led to (seasonal?) eutrophication, condensing the photic zonation. This would have exerted stress on the coral ecosystem and played a significant role in initiating microbialite development...|$|E
40|$|Phytoplankton {{studies using}} samples {{concentrated}} by settling revealed population dcnsitics several timcs {{higher than those}} rcportcd previously, based on centrifuge and bolting cloth concentrates. Clear and dark bottle experiments employing natural population densities rcvcaled photosynthetic yields averaging 1. 6 ~molcs of CO 2 absorbed per microlitcr of plant volume per hour. This yield is three times higher than previously reported yields based on artificially conccntratcd populations. Colnparison of daily photosynthetic yields per square meter of water as computed from bottle data with yields measured under completely natural conditions indicated an additional twofold discrepancy, with the natural condition yielding the highcr value. The reduction of turhulcncc in bottles may be operating to reduce the photosynthetic yield. Ecldy diffusivity in western I,akc Eric, computed from pFI change in the <b>dysphotic</b> <b>zone,</b> and vertical pH gradients, is about 25 cnP/sec. Simultaneous detcr-minations of CO 2 and 02 changes showed that 0 ~ changes usually were lower than CO 2 changes, suggesting that proccsscs other than photosynthesis arc influencing the CO 2 and O 2 budgets. During the past 30 years the aquatic com-munities of western Lake Erie have received rather intensive study. Until 1956, however, the phytoplankton studies utilized centri-fuge and bolting cloth to concentrate the organisms before counting, and average standing crops observed were less than one microliter of plant matter per liter (Verduin 1951, 1954). In the summer of 1956 Davis (1958) used a direct count method which avoided the losses inherent in centrifuge and bolting cloth methods. His average standing crop for the summer amounted to 6 PI/L {{which is similar to}} the maxima 1 crops reported during the previous 30 years, and is 10 times the previous averages. Much of the previous research in photosynthesis was also based on concentrated samples (Verduin 1956 a). The present paper presents the results of a research program using natural population densities. During the period June, 1957, to Septem-ber, 1958, the National Science Foundation subsidized a study of phytoplankton a...|$|E
40|$|Biological {{rates of}} oxygen {{production}} and consumption were computed by adding the rates of turbulent transport of oxygen to the obscwcd rates of change in concentration at successive depths. This involved using coefficients of vertical eddy diffusivity which were assumed to bc equivalent to coefficients of vertical eddy conductivity, computed {{on the basis of}} a heat transport equation utilizing Birgcan heat budgets. An attempt was made to assess the validity of the coefficients as follows. In the clinolimnion, the average values of the coefficients were similar when computed either on the basis of temperature change with depth and time or on the basis of the heat transport equation. A satisfactory correlation was obtained bctwccn the coefficients and a function of shearing stress (velocity gradient) and resistance to mixing (stability). The cocfficicnts decreased with increasing depth in the epilimnion, became minimal and constant in the metalimnion and increased in the hypolim-nion. Oxygen consmnption exceeded oxygen production below 5. 5 m and was maximal just below the cuphotic zone (9 - 12 m). Oxygen consumption was minimal in the metalimnion and incrcascd in the hypolimnion. An oxygen concentration maximum was correlated with the mctalimnetic oxygen consumption minimum. Euphotic zone oxygen production equiva-lent to <b>dysphotic</b> <b>zone</b> oxygen consumption amounted to 1. 01 g Oz/m 2 /day. Euphotic zone respiration would have been 1. 21 g Oz/m 2 /day if it proceeded at the same rate as in the 9 - to 12 -m stratum. On the basis of the ratios, oxygen consumption/chlorophyll and oxygen consumption/seston cuphotic zone respiration amounted to 1. 44 g Oz/m 2 /day and 2. 01 g Oa/m 2 /day respectively. Gross production values then would range between 2. 22 g Oz/m 2 / day and 3. 02 g 0,/m 2 /day. The latter value was extremely close to black and clear bottle estimates of 3. 00 g 02 /m 2 /day...|$|E
