40|$|A highly {{experienced}} versatile female professional singer displaying {{no apparent}} vocal complaint, developed <b>inhaling</b> singing, an innovative approach to reverse phonation. Although {{there are some}} reports in literature that describe the characteristics of ingressive phonation and sounds, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, no reports on actual <b>inhaling</b> singing are available in literature. This paper reports a case study on the acoustical analysis of <b>inhaling</b> singing, comparing this innovative technique with traditional exhaling singing. As this is rather undiscovered territory, we have decided to address several questions: is it possible to match the same pitches using <b>inhaling</b> singing compared to exhaling singing? Is the harmonic structure and energy distribution similar? Is it possible to maintain the same phonation duration in both techniques? Are there differences in volume and tessitura (vocal range) ? This paper, reporting on the experience of one individual, demonstrates that a tessitura can be mastered in <b>inhaling</b> singing. Spectral analysis reveals a similar frequency distribution in both conditions. However, in <b>inhaling</b> singing the energy of the harmonics is significantly lower for the first 3 overtones, while the maximum phonation time is larger, than in exhaling singing. The singer reports that less effort is required for <b>inhaling</b> singing in the high register. As such, <b>inhaling</b> singing offers new possibilities for vocal performance...|$|R

5|$|Boron nitride (along with Si3N4, NbN, and BNC) is {{reported}} to show weak fibrogenic activity, and to cause pneumoconiosis when <b>inhaled</b> in particulate form. The maximum concentration recommended for nitrides of nonmetals is 10mg/m3 for BN and 4 for AlN or ZrN.|$|E

5000|$|Kumbhaka is {{the pause}} between an <b>inhale</b> and exhale. According to B.K. S. Iyengar in Light on Yoga, the [...] "retention or holding the breath, {{a state where}} there is no {{inhalation}} or exalation". Mr. Iyengar also notes that in some yoga texts the term is used generically to indicate all three parts of the breath: <b>inhale,</b> exhale, and pauses. Along with the <b>inhale</b> and exhale, the kumbhaka is essential to any practice of pranayama. To further clarify the teachings of pranayama the khumbhaka which follows the exhale is called the bahya kumbhaka and that which follows the <b>inhale</b> is called the antara kumbhaka. (Bahya means outer/exterior. Antara means inner/interior.) ...|$|R
5|$|Even though alpha {{radiation}} cannot penetrate the skin, ingested or <b>inhaled</b> plutonium does irradiate internal organs. Alpha particles generated by <b>inhaled</b> plutonium {{have been found}} to cause lung cancer in a cohort of European nuclear workers. The skeleton, where plutonium accumulates, and the liver, where it collects and becomes concentrated, are at risk. Plutonium is not absorbed into the body efficiently when ingested; only 0.04% of plutonium oxide is absorbed after ingestion. Plutonium absorbed by the body is excreted very slowly, with a biological half-life of 200 years. Plutonium passes only slowly through cell membranes and intestinal boundaries, so absorption by ingestion and incorporation into bone structure proceeds very slowly.|$|E
5|$|Many {{cases of}} croup are {{preventable}} by immunization for influenza and diphtheria. Croup is usually {{treated with a}} single dose of steroids by mouth. In more severe cases <b>inhaled</b> epinephrine may also be used. Hospitalization is required in one to five percent of cases.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium is more {{dangerous}} when <b>inhaled</b> than when ingested. The risk {{of lung cancer}} increases once the total radiation dose equivalent of <b>inhaled</b> plutonium exceeds 400 mSv. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that the lifetime cancer risk from inhaling 5,000 plutonium particles, each about 3µm wide, to be 1% over the background U.S. average. Ingestion or inhalation of large amounts may cause acute radiation poisoning and possibly death. However no human being {{is known to have}} died because of inhaling or ingesting plutonium, and many people have measurable amounts of plutonium in their bodies.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{summarise}} and review all studies that have examined potential adverse health effects of passive exposure from <b>inhaling</b> e-cigarette vapour. Research objectives were to describe 1) the absolute impact of passive exposure from <b>inhaling</b> vapour when compared with background, and 2) the relative impact of passive exposure from <b>inhaling</b> vapour when compared with passive exposure from <b>inhaling</b> conventional cigarette smoke. The systematic review, which included  16 studies, found that those passively exposed to the vapours of e-cigarette users are exposed to numerous pollutants at levels above background and at concentrations that are associated with potential adverse health effects. The risk from being passively exposed to e-cigarette vapour is likely to be less than the risk from passive exposure to conventional cigarette smoke.  ...|$|R

Sonnabend served as Medical Director of CRI/CRIA until 1996.|$|E
5|$|A protein called DMT1 is {{the major}} {{transporter}} in manganese absorption from the intestine, and may be the major transporter of manganese across the blood–brain barrier. DMT1 also transports <b>inhaled</b> manganese across the nasal epithelium. The proposed mechanism for manganese toxicity is that dysregulation leads to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate-mediated excitoxicity, and aggregation of proteins.|$|E

40|$|In breath analysis, {{ambient air}} {{contaminations}} are ubiquitous {{and difficult to}} eliminate. This {{study was designed to}} investigate the reduction of ambient air background by a lung wash-out with synthetic air. The reduction of the initial ambient air volatile organic compound (VOC) intensity was investigated in the breath of 20 volunteers <b>inhaling</b> synthetic air via a sealed full face mask in comparison to <b>inhaling</b> ambient air. Over a period of 30 minutes, breath analysis was conducted using ion mobility spectrometry coupled to a multi-capillary column. A total of 68 VOCs were identified for <b>inhaling</b> ambient air or <b>inhaling</b> synthetic air. By treatment with synthetic air, 39 VOCs decreased in intensity, whereas 29 increased in comparison to <b>inhaling</b> ambient air. In total, seven VOCs were significantly reduced (P-value < 0. 05). A complete wash-out of VOCs in this setting was not observed, whereby a statistically significant reduction up to 65 % as for terpinolene was achieved. Our setting successfully demonstrated a reduction of ambient air contaminations from the airways by a lung wash-out with synthetic air...|$|R
