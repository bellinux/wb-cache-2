40|$|We analyze in {{this study}} cause of herding in a stock market. Information cascades have often been {{considered}} as a primary choice. However, we present evidences inconsistent {{in this study}}. Employing intraday order book data, our analysis supports the inclusion of of an alternative theory based on search cost of investors, {{in addition to the}} information cascade argument. Specifically, previous works studied daily data or those with lower frequency based on a herding measure of Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny (1992). We adopt instead the measure of Patterson and Sharma (2006) and argue that the search model of Vayanos and Wang (2007) characterizes herding phenomenon better at market open. Our analysis is also consistent with the information competition equilibrium of Back, Cao and Willard (2000) and dynamic friction model of Hu (2006). We find that stronger order flow herding is driven by lower transactions cost and shorter time <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>an</b> <b>order.</b> Herding tends <b>to</b> occur in trading of high-cap, high turnover stocks, which contradicts prediction of the information cascade hypothesis. Search cost effect is stronger at market open, while information cascade effect is stronger at market close. Therefore our study suggests that herding should be related both to intrinsic search cost structure of investors as well as information related factors. ...|$|R
40|$|Aims: As {{part of the}} EAPCI Young Initiative, the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI) {{conducted}} a survey to address {{the educational needs of}} young interventional cardiologists. Methods and results: A questionnaire was distributed to all individuals registered in the ESC database aged < 36 years with an interest in interventional cardiology. Nearly two-thirds of participants (60 %) indicated that they had difficulty in finding a fellowship training position. The desire for a fellow's course at European level was expressed by 95 %, while 94 % were in favour of developing a network of young interventional cardiologists in Europe. More than three-quarters of respondents (79 %) said they had had difficulty in obtaining funding to attend EuroPCR. Multiple difficulties were identified in setting up a research programme, two of the more frequent being problematic access to research networks and the difficulties of finding a mentor. Career orientation was identified as another issue, with more than half of respondents (59 %) declaring they followed career options by chance. Conclusions: The survey underlines the need <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>a</b> gap in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> address the needs of young interventional cardiologists. It may serve {{as a starting point for}} developing educational initiatives targeted at young interventional cardiologists...|$|R

The impact of market liquidity in times of stress on the corporate bond market: pricing, trading, and the availability of funds during heightened illiquidity. This paper investigates the impact of liquidity shocks on the composition of firms that enter the corporate bond market. When liquidity is at a premium, larger bonds by better known firms are much more prominent which squeezes smaller issuers and the high-yield market, in particular. This paper takes a novel approach to establishing that bond size is a liquidity factor, at least for some corporate debt, because the identification does not rest solely on a regression of spreads on bond size but rather on the interaction of that effect with observed illiquidity events. This leads to an important empirical dichotomy since issue size only commands a liquidity premium when illiquidity in the market is high. At other times, issue size appears, sometimes significantly and sometimes insignificantly, to be positively correlated with spreads, perhaps due to the need to find enough buyers <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>a</b> large <b>order</b> or <b>to</b> <b>a</b> liquidity penalty that the underwriter faces in taking a large issue into its inventory. Moreover, the estimated effect likely understates the true effect as the sample of bonds issued tends significantly towards bigger bonds in times of illiquidity. I also show that trading activity in corporate bonds appears related to bond size...|$|R

The goal is to minimize time at dock for trucks and railcars while also minimizing inventory. The techniques include a genetic algorithm, local search operators, heuristic rules, systematic search and hybrid approaches. Initial results show a hybrid genetic algorithm to be superior to the other methods. The evaluation function is a fast approximate form of a warehouse simulation.

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Because {{of their}} high cost, {{reducing}} the number of boards used <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>an</b> <b>order</b> of dimension parts is an important goal in a lumber rough mill. FLCO (Fuzzy Logic Cutting <b>Order)</b> is <b>a</b> computer program that achieves this goal. Using the concepts of fuzzy logic control, FLCO provides a heuristic approach to this problem. FLCO incorporates a version of the CORY lumber cut-up software, and provides a model of a rough-mill system that is able {{to reduce the number of}} boards needed <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>a</b> cutting <b>order.</b> FLCO allows different control methods to be used, including fuzzy logic control, dropping sizes from the cutting order as their demands are met, and no control. Because of the modularity of its design the FLCO code can easily incorporate other control methods. CORY lumber cut-up software provides sawing solutions for boards based on the values assigned to the sizes in <b>a</b> cutting <b>order.</b> After each board is sawn, the fuzzy logic controller adjusts the value of each size to achieve the objective of filling the demand for each size in <b>a</b> cutting <b>order</b> at about the same time. These new values are subsequently used by CORY when finding a sawing solution for the next board to be processed. Upon completion, FLCO reports the number of boards required to fill the cutting order, the average percent area yield, and the number of each piece recovered. Three cutting orders, three lumber grades and two types of control provide a means of determining the effects of fuzzy logic control on {{reducing the number of}} boards used <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>a</b> cutting <b>order.</b> Across all lumber grades and cutting orders, fuzzy logic control greatly reduces the number of boards as compared with dropping sizes. Fuzzy logic control slightly reduces the number of boards as compared with a more complicated method of control across all lumber grades and most cutting orders, but the difference is not statistically significant. In addition, the effect of fuzzy logic control on individual sizes is also examined...|$|R
