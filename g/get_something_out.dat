So even though the relationship {{was a bit of a}} disaster, I feel that in some way I did <b>get</b> <b>something</b> <b>out</b> of it, which was about half the songs on this record,” Kiedis said.|$|E

At 22 years old, her vocal range is astounding." [...] She went on to further {{describe}} her vocals as [...] "spectacular." ...|$|E

500|$|Depression Quest {{was first}} {{released}} online as {{a web browser}} game on February 14, 2013. Quinn also submitted the game through Steam's Greenlight program and consequently received disparaging comments and hate mail, causing her to withdraw the game from the service. After receiving positive feedback from players who had played the game and receiving an invitation to Indiecade, she tried Greenlight again. She received further harassment, but felt that she could deal with the stress. [...] "I thought, honestly, I could take the hate if it meant the game could reach somebody who would <b>get</b> <b>something</b> <b>out</b> of it, feel less alone," [...] Quinn stated.|$|E
500|$|During a November 2009 panel at the Paley Center for Media in New York City, Plaza said, [...] "You're {{going to}} see more scenes with Andy and April. There could be a love {{connection}} for them." [...] Daniels said some of his favorite moments from the series were in [...] "Hunting Trip" [...] and he particularly loved the [...] "interpersonal stuff" [...] between Andy and April, who he described as [...] "two characters that you didn't know had any interest in one another". Pratt specifically sought to make Plaza laugh during their scene together and was ultimately successful. He told Daniels before filming, [...] "I'm gonna <b>get</b> <b>something</b> <b>out</b> of her." [...] "Hunting Trip" [...] included a scene in which Leslie tells the state trooper multiple reasons or excuses for why she apparently shot Ron, all of which were edited together in a series of jump cuts. The technique has been commonly used throughout the Parks and Recreation series to condense multiple takes of improvisation from Poehler.|$|E
500|$|... "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] {{features}} {{the deaths of}} Patricia and Jimmy, who were both consumed by walkers. Alongside {{the deaths of the}} aforementioned characters, the episode's script initially called for the deaths of Hershel, as well as Shane Walsh and Randall, both of whom had died in the previous installment. Since Kirkman felt {{that there was a lot}} of potential development in Hershel, his death was scrapped from the script. Although plans to write off the character commenced earlier in the season, Mazzara opined that his hypothetical death would have carried no emotional resonance. [...] "The plan was always to whack Hershel, and I actually told Scott Wilson, 'Thanks for everything you've done, but in the next script we're going to kill off your character.' We started writing that and it felt like Hershel's death was playing as a plot device and we were getting no emotional resonance. It was just playing as a gratuitous death. This was one of those examples where we won't play a shocking death for the sense of death; we have to <b>get</b> <b>something</b> <b>out</b> of it. We got nothing out of it. If you look at the shot of Hershel looking back and seeing that barn burning and his farm completely lost to the zombies, that shot was well worth it because we see the farm was really a character and you can only see that through Hershel's eyes. So it was the right call to keep him alive." ...|$|E

Our fans have waited long enough, I think, so we wanna get something in their hands that they can listen to and hold, and put in their ears." [...] Holland added that the album will [...] "for sure" [...] be released in 2018. In an October 2017 interview, however, Holland said, [...] "I think I want to do like an EP. It's kind of what people are doing these days and it makes for less time in between stuff. It has been five years for us {{so we have a}} few songs together and I'm hoping to <b>get</b> <b>something</b> <b>out</b> by early next year." [...] In the same month, bassist Greg K. mentioned a possible 2018 release date for the new Offspring album, and revealed {{that one of the reasons}} for the album's slow progress is because they have been working on songs here and there. He also stated that the band is no hurry to finish the album.|$|E

2500|$|Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell {{scored the}} Xbox version 5 out of 10, calling the game [...] "one {{of the most}} painfully average platform/slasher games in recent history." [...] He criticized the game for [...] "some hideously ropey graphics, {{repetitive}} level design, dodgy pacing and far too many find-the-key routines." [...] He concluded [...] "The Hobbit is a common-or-garden 3D platform/slasher in the same form as , {{wrapped up in a}} five year-old's bedtime story version {{of one of the most}} popular fantasy books ever written. It's ten hours of a fairly easy going platform slashing with well-spaced save points, and young gamers might <b>get</b> <b>something</b> <b>out</b> of it, but for the majority it just is not good enough." ...|$|E

[...] He opines that increasing the degree of game mechanics through funware in work production {{will become even more}} effective on the millennial generation raised with video games and seek to stay in a game environment at the workplace. He has criticized current location-based applications like Foursquare as lacking enough social element as well as being too complicated for users to remain engaged.|$|E
2500|$|There {{should be}} no excuse given for the {{establishment}} of a belief that a functional nervous disability constitutes a right to compensation. [...] This is hard saying. [...] It may seem cruel that those whose sufferings are real, whose illness has been brought on by enemy action and very likely in the course of patriotic service, should be treated with such apparent callousness. [...] But there can be no doubt that in an overwhelming proportion of cases, these patients succumb to 'shock' because they <b>get</b> <b>something</b> <b>out</b> of it. [...] To give them this reward is not ultimately a benefit to them because it encourages the weaker tendencies in their character.

2500|$|In the Preliminary Final against Sydney FC, the Phoenix lost 4–2 in {{controversial}} circumstances. After {{being locked}} at 1–1 through goals from Chris Payne for Sydney and Andrew Durante for Wellington, Payne apparently missed a header and deflected {{the ball into}} the goal off his hand. Andrew Durante, who was marking Payne went straight over to the linesman, but the goal stood. [...] "I went straight to the linesman. I knew 100 per cent it was handball. I spoke to the ref at halftime about it and he said it wasn't deliberate. It's pretty funny that one. Such a big game and such a big occasion, for something like that to change the game is very disappointing." [...] Sydney FC strikers Alex Brosque and Mark Bridge both scored break-away goals as Phoenix pushed forward. Eugene Dadi then added a late consolation goal. Phoenix striker Chris Greenacre said that it changed the dynamics of the game. [...] "It just rips the heart out of you. We got back in the game with a good goal and that takes it away from you. It wasn't to be. I think we were right back in it. They played some good football but I thought we had withstood it OK. If we went into halftime [...] we were really confident we could <b>get</b> <b>something</b> <b>out</b> of it." [...] Coach Ricki Herbert echoed those statements. The loss brought the end to the Phoenix's season, meaning that Melbourne Victory and Sydney FC would compete in the Grand Final.|$|E
