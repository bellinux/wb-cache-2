30|$|Contemporary {{co-ordinate}} numbering of the HBV genome assigns {{a position}} of 1 to the first “T” nucleotide after the EcoR 1 restriction site (G|AA T TC) when sequenced in the forward direction. Prior to this convention, {{the start of the}} Core region (position 1901 in the contemporary system) was considered to be the first position of the HBV genome. The HBV genome is circular and position 1 happens to occur within the <b>full</b> <b>S</b> (surface) ORF. Therefore, the full nucleotide sequence of the S gene straddles position 1, and the <b>full</b> <b>S</b> ORF does not run contiguously within a linear sequence in the standard orientation. Thus, the start of the S ORF varies depending on the genotype, being 2854 for genotype A, 2848 for genotypes B to F and H, and 2884 for genotype G. In all genotypes, the S ORF ends at position 835. Extracting the <b>full</b> <b>S</b> gene sequence from linear sequence data therefore requires additional sequence processing.|$|R

40|$|Herbert Hovenkamp has indisputably {{earned the}} deanship of {{contemporary}} antitrust scholarship. One {{could point to}} many different attributes by which he has earned his laurels: fantastic scholarly productivity; clarity and precision in the craft of writing; analytical depth in both law and economics; moderation in a field apt to polarization; and custodianship of the influential Areeda treatise. In this Essay, I hope to honor another quality that has contributed significantly to Herb’s tremendous success as an antitrust scholar—his engagement with history. Much contemporary antitrust scholarship bursts with excitement at the discovery of new phenomena or theories that in all actuality have long shelf lives in earlier epochs in the antitrust cycle. Though antitrust scholars often speak as though economic analysis began with the structuralist school of the 1950 <b>s,</b> <b>Herb</b> has frequently reminded everyone that antitrust proponents and opponents have never faced a shortage of economic theories. Through his insights as a legal historian, Herb has helped make the antitrust community aware of the resonances of current debates with the debates and resolutions of earlier generations...|$|R

50|$|When {{the family}} of noble gases was first {{identified}} {{at the end of}} the nineteenth century, none of them was observed to form any compounds and it was initially believed that they were all inert gases (as they were then known) which could not form compounds. With the development of atomic theory in the early twentieth century, their inertness was ascribed to a full valence shell of electrons which render them very chemically stable and nonreactive. All noble gases have <b>full</b> <b>s</b> and p outer electron shells (except helium, which has no p sublevel), and so do not form chemical compounds easily. Their high ionization energy and almost zero electron affinity explain their non-reactivity.|$|R
