5|$|Birds {{have been}} domesticated and bred as poultry {{for use as}} food <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>four</b> {{thousand}} years. The most important species is the chicken. It {{appears to have been}} domesticated by 5000 BC in northeastern China, likely for cockfighting, and only later used for food. In ancient Egypt, poultry including ducks, geese, and pigeons were captured in nets and then bred in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Coenwulf {{came into}} {{conflict}} with Archbishop Wulfred of Canterbury {{over the issue of}} whether laypeople could control religious houses such as monasteries. The breakdown in {{the relationship between the two}} eventually reached the point where the archbishop was unable to exercise his duties <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>four</b> years. A partial resolution was reached in 822 with Coenwulf's successor, King Ceolwulf, but it was not until about 826 that a final settlement was reached between Wulfred and Coenwulf's daughter, Cwoenthryth, who had been the main beneficiary of Coenwulf's grants of religious property.|$|E
5|$|Conservation {{efforts for}} Hydnellum are {{hindered}} {{by the fact}} that some species are difficult to discriminate in the field, making it hard to determine an appropriate conservation status. Techniques based on species-specific PCR primers and DNA extraction from soil have been developed to detect the mycelia of various Hydnellum species without having to rely on the presence of fruitbodies, which may help conservation efforts as well as improve understanding of below-ground ecology. Similar techniques have been used to show that, in the case of H.aurantiacum and H.caeruleum, the fungus can persist below the ground <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>four</b> years without producing fruitbodies.|$|E

5|$|Intermittent torrents {{battered}} Saint Kitts and Nevis <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>four</b> days; a {{total of}} up to 10.99inches (279mm) of precipitation was recorded during that time. Several homeowners reported significant flooding, {{and a number of}} persons had to be rescued from their homes. Gusty winds generated rough sea conditions along coastal regions, resulting in some beach erosion and the collapse of a sidewalk section. Rains and associated floods topped a number of culverts and bridges, washed out the sides of some roadways, and damage to some utility lines, followed by significant disruptions to electricity services. The exact amount of damage to the territory remains unknown, however.|$|E

Some four hundred prints were sold at a price of £8 each, and they circulated <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>four</b> or five years. The character of Rover the dog, played by Hepworth's family dog Blair, became a household name and is considered the world's first canine film star. This first appearance of a dog in a narrative based film caused the uncommon name of Rover to become popular for dogs.|$|E

5|$|The New England Patriots feature 22 {{former players}} and two {{contributors}} in their team hall of fame, established in 1991. A committee {{of media and}} staff selected 11 players for enshrinement between 1991 and 2001, before a six-year span of no selections. In 2007, {{in advance of the}} 2008 opening of The Hall at Patriot Place, the Patriots introduced a new nomination committee to select three candidates, with the winner of an Internet fan vote being enshrined in the hall of fame. In order to be eligible, players and coaches must be retired <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>four</b> years.

5|$|The Western Pacific Railroad {{completed}} its main line into California in 1909. This followed the old Beckwourth Trail east of Quincy, {{but to the}} west it reached Oroville and Marysville via the Feather River Canyon. While building the railroad, the Utah Construction Company had created a dirt road through the canyon to assist with construction; citizens created the Plumas County Road Association in 1911 to push for improvements to this roadway and creation of a year-round route between Oroville and Quincy (the existing route over the ridges was closed <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>four</b> months each winter). The first state highway bond issue, passed by the state's voters in 1910, included a Route 30 connecting Oroville with Quincy. Plumas County surveyor Arthur W. Keddie surveyed the Feather River Canyon route for the California Highway Commission in 1913, but the state announced in 1916 that the existing ridge route would be improved. After much debate, the state legislative road committee included the statement that this route would follow the Feather River in the 1919 amendment authorizing a third bond issue; instead of keeping it as Route 30, the Highway Commission changed the designation to {{an extension of the}} short Richvale-Oroville (now SR 162) Route 21, which was also part of the first bond issue.|$|E
