5|$|The {{match was}} characterised {{by a large}} number of fouls – 13 by United, 18 by Arsenal – and referee Steve Bennett showed four yellow cards to each team, {{although}} most of those came {{as a result of the}} fracas at the end of the game. Vieira was booked in the 77th minute for a foul on Quinton Fortune, and was shown a second yellow card not long after, in the 80th minute. In challenging for a high ball outside the Arsenal penalty area, Van Nistelrooy jumped up onto Vieira's back. Vieira fell to the ground and kicked out at Van Nistelrooy in retaliation, causing the Manchester United striker to jump backwards. Van Nistelrooy was booked for the original foul, and although Vieira's <b>kick</b> <b>failed</b> to connect with the Dutchman, the referee believed that the intent was there and booked Vieira for the second time, resulting in his dismissal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Maryland {{advanced}} to the Oklahoma 20-yard line, and Tatum elected for a field goal attempt. Now against the wind, the <b>kick</b> <b>failed,</b> with the ball going wide right. The Sooners took over on downs and halfback Jack Ging completed a pass to end Max Boydston for a five-yard gain. Ging then rushed for threeyards. On the next play, Calame pitched to Grigg who ran {{to the left and}} picked up 12yards for a first down. Calame then completed a pass to back Bob Burris for sixyards. Grigg faked a pass and ran to the right for a gain of 12yards and a first down on the Maryland 39-yard line. The Terrapins stopped two Sooner rushing attempts before Calame connected with Burris again for an 11-yard gain. Burris then rushed for threemore yards to advance to the Maryland 25. Tatum called a time-out. On third down with oneyard to go, Calame faked a handoff to Ging and executed an option run to the left. He pitched to Grigg and threw a block. Grigg was tackled at the goal-line but managed to extend his body into the endzone. Buddy Leake made the extra point. Shortly before halftime, Calame suffered a separated collarbone. With back-up Pat O'Neal also injured, only third-string quarterback Jack Van Pool remained, and he had little game experience.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fourth}} quarter the Eagles took {{advantage}} of a blocked Giants punt with McNabb's 10-yard touchdown pass to Small, making the score 20–10, but their subsequent onside <b>kick</b> <b>failed</b> and the Giants held the ball {{for the rest of}} the game.|$|E

[...] With the Redskins driving for the possible tying field goal, defensive tackle Merlin Olsen pressured Jurgensen into throwing the game clinching interception to Robertson, who weaved his way {{back and forth across the}} field as he ran to the end zone. The extra point <b>kick</b> <b>failed,</b> but Olsen then recorded two more sacks, preventing any hopes of a Redskins comeback. Joe Theismann was returning punts for the Redskins at this time. This was the last game in Hall of Famer Sonny Jurgensen's career.|$|E
2500|$|The {{game was}} played in a cold rain and stiff wind, {{resulting}} in numerous fumbles and an inaccurate kicking game.

[...] Jack Loell scored the first touchdown on a short run, and [...] "Octy" [...] Graham kicked the extra point. In the second half, Magoffin caught a forward pass from Wasmund and eluded Ohio State's tacklers on a 40-yard touchdown play. [...] Michigan missed the extra point and led, 11–0.

2500|$|In 1892, Jewett {{played a}} central role in a memorable game against an Oberlin College team coached by John Heisman. Michigan met Oberlin at Ann Arbor in November 1892. Jewett scored four touchdowns in the game, {{including}} an unopposed 45-yard touchdown run after Oberlin thought time had been called. After Oberlin went ahead, 12-6, Jewett scored his second touchdown on a run from 25 yards out, but his <b>kick</b> <b>failed,</b> so the Wolverines trailed 12-10. Oberlin scored again to make it 18-10. A few minutes later, Jewett ran to [...] "within a foot of the goal line," [...] and the umpire (a former Michigan player) ruled that Jewett had scored a touchdown. [...] Jewett completed the kick after touchdown and the score was 18-16. Jewett also made a touchdown-saving tackle in the Oberlin game, catching up with Charles Savage from behind at the five yard line after a 90-yard run. After Oberlin scored to go ahead 24-22, the referee (an Oberlin player acting as referee in the second half) announced that time had run out and called the game. [...] The umpire (a Michigan man) ruled that four minutes remained on the game clock owing to timeouts that Oberlin's timekeeper had not recorded. As the Oberlin team left the field claiming victory, Michigan lined up, snapped the ball, and Jewett walked the ball across the goal line for Michigan's fifth touchdown. The next day, the Michigan Daily reported: [...] "Oberlin compromised herself by leaving the field before time was up.... Referee Ensworth, an Oberlin substitute, lost all tab of time, and called the game at 14 minutes to 5, while the captain of each team had agreed to play until 10 minutes of that hour." [...] Both schools still record the game as a victory.|$|E
60|$|He did. At the {{beginning}} of the game the ropes were lined by some thirty spectators, who had come to derive a languid enjoyment from seeing the First pile up a record score. By half-time their numbers had risen to an excited mob of something over three hundred, and {{the second half of the}} game was fought out to the accompaniment of a storm of yells and counter yells such as usually only belonged to school-matches. The Second Fifteen, after a poor start, suddenly awoke to the fact that this was not going to be the conventional massacre by any means. The First had scored an unconverted try five minutes after the kick-off, and it was after this that the Second began to get together. The school back bungled the drop out badly, and had to find touch in his own twenty-five, and after that it was anyone's game. The scrums were a treat to behold. Payne was a monument of strength. Time after time the Second had the ball out to their three-quarters, and just after half-time Bowden slipped through in the corner. The <b>kick</b> <b>failed,</b> and the two teams, with their scores equal now, settled down grimly to fight the thing out to a finish. But though they remained on their opponents' line for most of the rest of the game, the Second did not add to their score, and the match ended in a draw of three points all.|$|E

50|$|In Canadian {{football}} any kick {{that goes}} into the end zone is a live ball, except for a successful field goal or if the goalposts are hit while the ball is in flight. If the player receiving the <b>kick</b> <b>fails</b> to return it out of the end zone, or (except on a kickoff) if the ball was kicked through the end zone, then the kicking team scores a single point (rouge), and the returning team scrimmages from its 35-yard line or, if the rouge is scored {{as a result of a}} missed field goal attempt, the receiving team may choose the last point of scrimmage. If a kickoff goes through the end zone without a player touching it or a kicked ball in flight hits a post without scoring a field goal, there is no score, and the receiving team scrimmages from its 25-yard line. If the kick is returned out of the end zone, the receiving team next scrimmages from the place that was reached (or if they reach the opponents' goal line, they score a touchdown); in the amateur levels of the game, they are given the ball at their 20-yard line if the kick was not returned that far.|$|R

Brad Nortman's punt was partially blocked and downed at the Minnesota 5-yard line, giving the Gophers one final chance at snapping Wisconsin's win streak.|$|R
