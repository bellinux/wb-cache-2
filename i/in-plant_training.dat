40|$|The Problem. The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{ascertain}} the opinions of industrial-type employers concerning the characteristics, traits, and standards desired of entry-level employees in industrial-type occupations. The second major purpose of this investigation was to determine the educational implications of the needs and expectations expressed by selected industrial employers in the Omaha Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA). ^ Procedures. A comprehensive review of the literature and related research was undertaken. Interviews with selected vocational educators and representatives of manufacturing firms were conducted. From a total population of 673 manufacturers in the Omaha SMSA, a random sample of 209 firms was selected. A questionnaire was developed, validated, and administered to the sample population. The data obtained from the questionnaire were tabulated, verified for accuracy, analyzed, and reported as raw scores, mean scores, and percentages. ^ Summary of Major Findings. (1) Eighty-two percent of the respondents indicated that preferred high school graduates as entry-level employees. (2) Ninety-seven percent of the employers indicated that neatness and accuracy were important in completing the job application form. (3) Ninety-seven percent of the employers agreed that the personal interview was considered critical in deciding whether or not to hire. (4) Seventy-five percent of the respondents indicated that applicants who possess broad trade and industrial preparation, rather than single skill preparation, were considered better candidates for entry-level jobs. (5) Eighty percent of the employers agreed that high school on-the-job training was desirable for those applying for an entry-level job. (6) Ninety-seven percent of the employers agreed that <b>in-plant,</b> on-the-job <b>training</b> was the most common method used to train entry-level, industrial-type employees. (7) Ninety-three percent of the respondents indicated that a positive work ethic was more important than a previously acquired skill. (8) Eighty-two percent of the employers reported that reference information from the prospective employee 2 ̆ 7 s previous employer was more desirable than personal recommendations from school personnel. (9) Ninety-two percent of the respondents indicated they desired reference information from the prospective employee 2 ̆ 7 s previous employer. (10) Over ninety percent of the respondents reported that a positive work ethic, regular job attendance, being on time, ability to get along with fellow workers, dependability, and honesty, were highly desirable traits. ^ Conclusions and Recommendatons. (1) Youth who plan to work in industrial-type jobs can increase their chances of becoming employed by remaining in school and completing their high school education. (2) The prospective entry-level employees can increase their chances for employment if they would become proficient in completing job application forms and learn how to interview effectively. (3) High school industrial education experiences would be beneficial in developing the skills needed to operate industrial machines and to use basic hand tools. (4) High school students would benefit from expanding their instructional program to include several skill areas instead of concentrating on one specific skill. (5) Prospective entry-level employees would increase their chances for securing a job if they had experience in a high school cooperative on-the-job training program. (6) Students who plan to work in industrial-type jobs could increase their chances of becoming successful employees if they recognized the importance of the personal traits identified in number ten of the findings, and conscientiously worked to improve themselves in these matters. (7) The schools should examine the findings of this study to determine the adequacy of their current vocational offerings and counseling services. ...|$|R

40|$|Vocational {{training}} system for skilled workforce has been highlighted as one ofthe key driving forces of South Korea's economic development. South Korea {{is well known}} for adopting a government-led vocational training strategy to make sure the supply of a skilled workforce according to the 1 st [...] 7 th five-year economic developmentplans. This paper examines the main features and developmental changes of this strategy from the 1960 s to the 1990 s and suggests a set of important lessons for the design and implementation of vocational training policies. Vocational training policy also was led by the government and complemented by private sector. By providing training program through the establishment of public training institutes, the government managed the supply of skills. While the government has consistently expanded and controlled the vocational {{training system}} for meeting the needs of industry, the principle system was the compulsory <b>in-plant</b> <b>training</b> system, in which itwas obligatory for large companies to provide training program for their workforce or alternatively contribute the training promotion fund. The initial stages of this system in the 1970 s were considered as successful in terms of raising numbers of trainees withinindustry. However the numbers later fell dramatically in the 1980 s after the government reformed its policy. Many employers resisted against the burden of training obligation and levy.

40|$|This {{study is}} about {{understanding}} {{how the government}} policy actually works at firm level {{in the context of}} developing countries' industrialization. In the literature, the discussions on impact of government policy on corporate performance primarily stress on macroeconomic aspects of industrial behavior and broad measures of industrial performance. They offer inadequate understanding of the mechanisms through which firms' performance is affected. This study attempts to fill in this void. It specifically endeavours to answer the research question: how Industrial policy affects performance of the firms? For empirical evidence, we considered the case of CNC Machine Tool industry in India. The study is primarily exploratory and qualitative based on case studies. The study endeavors to explain the policy-performance causation placing resources of the firms at the center of analysis. The three elements of the causality chain: policy, resource and performance are the building blocks of our analysis. The policy is seen in terms of technology, investment, education and training, market development and industrial governance. The resource is segmented as research, development and engineering; manufacturing; human; marketing and linkage. All these are further elaborated in terms of three more constructs: capability, mechanism and indicator. We analysed how the firms adopted various mechanisms to leverage the policies in force to build different capabilities that finally culminate in firms' performance. In certain cases the mechanisms were adopted to compensate the absence of policy or lessen its adverse impact. The promotional nature of Technology- and Investment policy as well as increased transparency in industrial governance since 1991, led the firms to emphasize more on mechanisms of assimilation of technology, new product development and subcontracting to build product development- and manufacturing capability that culminated in increased sales and exports. In the absence of suitable Education and Training policy the firms recruited educated persons, imparted <b>in-plant</b> <b>training</b> and periodic training to build human resource capability that increased firms' labour productivity. The observed divergence in firms' performance is attributed to variations in scope and implementation of mechanisms by the firms. A few pro-active firms identified what policy provides and how best that could be used or what policy does not provide and acted accordingly. The small firms appear to give less emphasis on adoption of mechanisms primarily due to resource constraints. The analyses further led to the identification of certain activities or `processes` that are found to be crucial for building various capabilities in the firms. A process encompasses one or more mechanisms either in its essence or in totality. It may also be an underlying factor that triggers mechanisms to work individually or together. The processes are visualised as acquisition, integration, development and generation. Their identification has added another bead in the strand of policy-performance causation. Like the mechanisms, the adoption of processes by the firms is also influenced by various policies in vogue that finally culminates in firms' performance. Thus the government needs to give proper emphasis on strengthening of these processes for sustained development of an industry. From the policy perspective, this research is an attempt to provide a systematic analysis that improves policy-making...|$|E

This research report {{on the one hand}} investigates the basic structure of retail trade {{and on the other hand}} studies the in-plant characteristics of establishments in the retail trade compared with establishments in the service sector and the private sector. The analysis will focus on the distribution of the atypical employment, the bargaining coverage, the in-plant education and training, expected problems with human resource management, the need for skilled workers and the employment of older workers. Based on the analysis of the IAB Establishment Panel 2010 and 2011, there is a strong distribution and intensity in the use of part-time work and marginal employment in the retail sector. 82 percent of the establishments in the retail sector use part-time work and 64 percent employ at least one mini-jobber. 44 percent of the employees in the retail trade work part-time and 23 percent are marginally employed. Despite of the annulment of the collective agreement in 2000, retail trade establishments have a higher degree of collective bargaining coverage compared to establishments of the service sector. 27 percent of the establishments in the retail trade are subject to an industry-wide wage agreement, 2 percent to a company agreement concluded by the establishment and the trade union and 71 percent of all establishments in the retail sector are not bound by collective bargaining. In-plant education plays an important role in the retail sector. Compared to the service and the private sectors, more establishments in retail trade are legally authorised to educate apprentices and actively train apprentices at a higher rate. Otherwise there aren't differences concerning the participation in <b>in-plant</b> <b>training.</b> The most frequently used types of qualification are external and internal seminars and on-the-job training (instruction, initial skill adaption training). The analysis show that there aren't major differences concerning the expected problems with human resource management between the three sectors. Nearly 60 percent of all establishments in retail, the service and the private sectors predict no problems with human resource management. The problems mentioned most frequently are high financial burden on wage cost, difficulties in finding the required specialized personnel on the labor market, followed by lack of motivation in the workplace. In the first half of 2011 the need for skilled workers in the retail trade in Germany was about 106. 000 persons. This is an increase of 4. 000 employees compared to the previous year. Furthermore, 19 percent of the establishments in retail trade expect having to fill new vacancies or reoccupy old vacancies with qualified employees until 2013.

40|$|The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA) is federal {{legislation}} that significantly changed the federal government's approach to funding, overseeing, and providing workforce development services. The Act replaced its predecessor, the Job Training Partnership Act(JTPA), and brought together once separate laws governing services (Wagner-Peyser). Five goals emphasized: streamlining services through a One-Stop service delivery systemproviding universal {{access to all}} job seekers, workers and employerspromoting customer choices through use of vouchersstrengthening accountability by implementing strict performance measurespromoting leadership by the business sector on state and local Workforce Investment Board. This study is designed to review the WIA implementation {{in terms of the}} relationship of WIA programs and the federally funded employment and training program, WIA governance and funding, delivery system through One Stop centerproviding training services by vouchers, state-funded training program for incumbent workers and WIA reauthorization issues. This study presents the findings from reviewing WIA implementation and learns the lesson and develops its implications to Korea training policies. 1. Findings This study identifies 44 programs administrated by 9 federal agencies through providing a range of employment and training services. These programs service a total more than 30 million individuals and represent a combined $ 30 billion in fiscal year 2002. By WIA, the mandated 17 partner programs are provided together at One-Stop center in every area over the country. Although WIA brought together several federal programs, there is no single administrative agency in charge ofit. Instead it promotes linkage among them by reinforcing a governance structure of state and local boards. Because there are no incentives for partner organizations to contribute financially to the One-Stop center, WIA suffer a few fund with continued divestment of federal government. Local boards are required to establish at least one One-Stop center, a local point for the provision of all training and employment services and a new role under WIA. Also local boards are required to implement an Individual Training Account(ITA) system to allow customer to choose from Eligible Training Provider List(ETPL). Therefore local boards are prohibited from providing direct services, including the newly defined employment supports of core and intensive services, direct training, and one-stop operation. The Use of One Stop Center {{is at the heart of}} WIA. Most states gives local boards flexibility on selecting the One Stop operators, and local areas usually use two different types of organizations and arrangement in the same area. Core Services are the first one of services available at One Stop Center. Intensive services focuses on dislocated worker customer in particular and are the intermediate step between core services and training services. In an effort to provide more customer choice, WIA mandates that decisions on which training program and provider be left up to the customers for adults and dislocated worker programs. When customers are deemed appropriate for training in WIA, they are issued individual training accounts(ITAs). A customer driven system has the potential to substantially increase training choices for WIA customers. However the system had detrimental effects on the number of providers and adult receiving training. In this study the case of California State Workforce Investment Board, City of Los Angeles Local Workforce Investment Board, Sunvelley Work Source Center, Pierce Community College, Los Angeles Job Corps Center were reviewed. Almost half of states fund employment placement and training through employer taxes. After WIA allowed state and local governments to use federal funds for training employed workers, state and local workforce boards focuses their training initiatives for employed workers on training that addressed specific business needs and emphasized workplace skills. In this study the case of California Employment Training Panel(ETP) was reviewed. Initially passed in August 1998, the current law authorizes programs through September 30, 2003. Congress must decide whether to maintain or change funding requirement. Now it is likely to pass a new federal law.
