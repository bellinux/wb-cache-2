The characteristics of the development of anaerobic power and capacity in soccer players have not been elucidated. Objective: Evaluate and compare the power and anaerobic capacity in soccer players of the basic categories, sub 15, sub 17, sub 20 and adult athletes that play in professional football club. Methodology: The sample consisted of 197 male soccer players, <b>divided</b> <b>by</b> <b>category</b> vying for championships: Group Sub 15 (n = 42), Group Sub 17 (n = 41), Group Sub 20 (n = 86); Group Adult (n = 28).

Results: the results allowed for the conclusion that in soccer players the maximum anaerobic power is dependent on the chronological age until the adult category, since the anaerobic capacity was dependent until the age of 20 sub category.

40|$|In the {{earliest}} stages, sensitive special educators interpret a child’s activities {{as he or}} she expresses his or her will, purpose, emotions, and desires. The child is participating in a dialogue with the special educator, based on the educator’s interpretative reactions. In this way, the child gradually enters the world of common human values, intentions, wishes, and emotions. The basic aim of the master thesis, presented in 227 pages, is to realize the necessity of implementing more sensitive communication techniques and interaction skills with pupils in special schools and institutions, according to the principles of ICDP program. This was accomplished through self-evaluation questionnaires given to special educators, asking them to make an evaluation of their own communication skills with pupils in special schools and institutions. Consideration was also made toward the need for establishing sensitive communication skills between the special education teacher and the child, as collected from the responses given by pupils and their parents. The thesis contains the following parts: introduction, theoretical approach to the research problem, research methodology, research results, discussion, conclusion, proposal recommendations, and bibliography, along with the data from questionnaires and surveys used for the research. The introduction highlights the need for research in assessing the importance of implementing sensitive communication techniques and interaction skills for special educators who work with children who have intellectual disabilities in special institutions. The theoretical approach to the research problem describes the intellectual disability by defining the concept, etiology of intellectual disability, classification, prevalence and characteristics of children with mild, medium, severe and profound intellectual disabilities. Furthermore, this section makes {{a detailed description of the}} ICDP program’s aims, tasks, and theoretical grounding, emphasizing the importance of early interaction throughout all stages of early interaction. The contents of the ICDP program describes the concept that the caregiver has for the child, the eight principles for good interaction and empathetic identification, the seven principles of sensitivity, and all areas and ways of implementing this program. Finally, in this section the current ICDP experiences in the Republic of Macedonia are described. The methodology section defines the subject, aim and character of the research, tasks, hypothesis, variables, methods, techniques and instruments, population sample, organization and development of research and statistical techniques required for data processing. The population sample was composed of 140 respondents divided into seven groups, each with twenty respondents. The first three groups were comprised of special education instructors and rehabilitation therapists who work with children with mild, medium and severe intellectual disability, fourth and fifth group consisted of two groups of children with mild and medium intellectual disability, while sixth and seventh group were comprised of their parents. In the analysis and interpretation of results, the answers of each group of respondents are analyzed separately, then the groups of special education teachers and rehabilitation therapists, parent and pupils with intellectual disabilities are compared. Processing of data research was conducted using statistical techniques and stages: grouping and making tables from data and R X C Exact Contingency Table. No significant statistical difference between groups divided in this way was noted. In the next part a comparison of respondents <b>divided</b> <b>by</b> <b>category</b> of disability they work with, or to which they belong. In this part we had two groups: mild and medium intellectual disability. A statistically strong significance was found in the differences between the answers of respondents to each question from the questionnaire sheet. While the special education teachers and rehabilitation therapists were satisfied with their work and approach to pupils with intellectual disabilities, their parents showed an average satisfaction, while the pupils themselves were consistently dissatisfied with the work of their “teachers. ” In conclusion, it is emphasized that the necessity of implementing a program that enables more sensitive communication and interaction with pupils with intellectual disabilities...|$|E

Following Autor et al.

40|$|AbstractDespite {{the general}} price {{decrease}} of construction projects {{the price of}} highway projects has tended to rise. Research has shown that building highways in the Czech Republic costs about 30 % more than comparable projects abroad, for example in Germany and Austria. This paper will identify possible causes within the process of construction of highways. The paper will also identify the possibilities of cost optimization for the construction process. The total cost of highways consist of the construction cost (hard cost), the development cost (e. g. design fees, management fees), and the site cost (e. g. purchase of the land). This paper will present {{an analysis of the}} total costs of selected sections of the highways recently built in the Czech Republic. The elements that influence the total costs are design parameters of the road (category) and the topography. The output of this analysis is the average cost per one kilometer of a highway <b>divided</b> <b>by</b> the <b>category</b> of the road and the topography characteristics (urban/rural area, flat, hilly or mountainous area). The paper also analyses the additional costs associated with the overall project, especially the cost of the development of the project documents and the purchase of the land.
