40|$|A common task of Web users is {{querying}} structured {{information from}} Web pages. In this {{paper we propose}} a novel query processor for systematically discovering any-k relations from Web search results with conjunctive queries. The ‘any-k ’ phrase denotes that retrieved tuples are not ranked by the system. For realizing this interesting scenario the query processor transfers a structured query into keyword queries that are submitted to a search engine, <b>forwards</b> <b>search</b> results to relation extractors, and then combines relations into result tuples. Unfortunately, relation extractors may fail to return a relation for a result tuple. We propose a solid information theory-based approach for retrieving missing attribute values of partially retrieved relations. Moreover, user-defined data sources may not return at least k complete result tuples. To solve this problem, we extend the Eddy query processing mechanism [14] for our ‘querying the Web ’ scenario with a continuous, adaptive routing model. The model determines the most promising next incomplete row for returning any-k complete result tuples at any point during the query execution process. We report a thorough experimental evaluation over multiple relation extractors. Our experiments demonstrate that our query processor returns complete result tuples while processing only very few Web pages...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the classical stepwise <b>forward</b> and backward <b>search</b> methods for selecting sparse {{models in the}} context of linear regression with the number of candidate variables p greater than the number of observations n. In the noiseless case, we give definite upper bounds for the number of <b>forward</b> <b>search</b> steps to recover all relevant variables, if each step of the <b>forward</b> <b>search</b> is approximately optimal in reduction of residual sum of squares, up to a fraction. These upper bounds for the number of steps are of the same order as the size of a true sparse model under mild conditions. In the presence of noise, traditional information criteria such as BIC and AIC are designed for p < n and may fail spectacularly when p is greater than n. To overcome this difficulty, two information criteria BICP and BICC are proposed to serve as the stopping rules in the stepwise <b>searches.</b> The <b>forward</b> <b>search</b> with noise is proved to be approximately optimal with high probability, compared with the optimal <b>forward</b> <b>search</b> without noise, so that the upper bounds for the number of steps still apply. The proposed BICP is proved to stop the <b>forward</b> <b>search</b> as soon as it recovers all relevant variables and remove all extra variables in the backward deletion. This leads to the selection consistency of the estimated models. The proposed methods are illustrated in a simulation study which indicates that the new methods outperform a counterpart LASSO selector with a penalty parameter set at a fixed value. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we suggest an {{extension}} of the <b>forward</b> <b>search</b> methodology to GARCH models which are often used for forecasting stock market volatility. It is frequently found that estimated residuals from GARCH models have excess kurtosis, even when one allows for conditional t-distributed errors. Some papers have appeared on outlier detection in GARCH models but the proposed methods are iterative and may suffer from masking effects. The <b>forward</b> <b>search</b> is a method for determining the effect of outliers on fitted parameters and for detecting also masked outliers. In the case of GARCH models outliers are strictly related to extreme observations which are responsible for the well-known volatility clustering of financial returns.

40|$|Summary. We {{suggest a}} simple robust method for the {{detection}} of atypical and influential observations in binomial data.

The effectiveness of the <b>forward</b> <b>search</b> estimator in detecting masked multiple outliers, and more generally in ordering binomial data, is shown by means of three data sets.

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} of the statisticians {{is to be able to}} effectively present and communicate statistical results (Tufte 1983, Spence 2001). This happens in particular when working on applied problems with non-statisticians.

40|$|Abstract—Endmember {{extraction}} is {{an important}} step in spec-tral mixture analysis when endmembers are unknown. Endmem-bers are usually assumed to be pure pixels present in an image scene. Under this circumstance, endmember extraction is to find the most distinctive pixels. To make the searching process more efficient, the sequential <b>forward</b> <b>search</b> (SFS) method is generally used, where the next endmember is determined with a certain criterion based on the currently extracted endmember set. This letter proposes a new criterion which is related to the estimated endmember abundances. Compared to other sequential endmem-ber extraction algorithms, the proposed method can find all the different endmembers faster. This letter also proposes to use the sequential <b>forward</b> floating <b>search</b> method as the substitute of SFS, which can improve the performance of all the sequential endmember extraction algorithms.

40|$|Abstract: One of {{the most}} {{successful}} methods for planning in large partially observable stochastic domains is depth-limited <b>forward</b> <b>search</b> from the current belief state together with a utility estimation. However, when the environment is continuous and the number of possible actions is practically infinite, then abstractions have to be made before any <b>forward</b> <b>search</b> planning can be performed. The paper presents a method to dynamically generate such planning problem abstractions for a domain that is inspired by our research with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The planning problems are created by first stating the selection of points to fly to as an optimization problem. When the points have been selected, a set of possible paths between them are then created with a pathplanner and then <b>forward</b> <b>search</b> in the belief state space is applied. The method has been implemented and tested in simulation and the experiments show the importance of modelling both the dynamics of the environment and the limited computational resources of the architecture when searching for suitable parameters in the planning problem formulation procedure...|$|R
40|$|The <b>forward</b> <b>search</b> is {{a method}} of robust data {{analysis}} in which outlier free subsets of the data of increasing size are used in model fitting; the data are then ordered by closeness to the model.

Application of the <b>forward</b> <b>search</b> to the proposed individual clusters leads {{to the establishment of}} cluster membership through the identification of non-cluster members as outlying.

We also provide an automatic method for determining cluster centres and compare the behaviour of our method with model-based clustering.
