50|$|The {{star was}} first {{discovered}} in a 1993 survey that searched for bright near-infrared sources within 0.55°2 of the Galactic Centre. The survey used 1-20 micron photometry and used a two channel InSb detector on the 1 meter ANU telescope in Australia. 50 objects were targeted {{and most of them}} had bolometric magnitudes below -5. The star itself was observed in May 1987. Its Position, JHKLNMQ Magnitudes, Right ascension, Declination, and Silicate absorption were noted. The survey was conducted by Tetsuya Nagata, A. R. <b>Hyland,</b> <b>S.</b> M. Straw, Shuji Sato, and Kimiaki Kawara. The survey named the star NHS93 22, NHS standing for the three leading scientists in the survey (Nagata, Hyland, and Straw); 93 signifying the date of discovery; and 22 indicating that it was the 22nd star observed.|$|E

40|$|LpxC [UDP- 3 -O-(R- 3 -hydroxymyristoyl) -GlcNAc deacetylase] is a metalloamidase that catalyzes {{the first}} {{committed}} {{step in the}} biosynthesis of the lipid A component of lipopolysaccharide. A previous study (H. R. Onishi, B. A. Pelak, L. S. Gerckens, L. L. Silver, F. M. Kahan, M. H. Chen, A. A. Patchett, S. M. Galloway, <b>S.</b> A. <b>Hyland,</b> M. <b>S.</b> Anderson, and C. R. H. Raetz, Science 274 : 980 - 982, 1996) identified a series of synthetic LpxC-inhibitory molecules that were bactericidal for Escherichia coli. These molecules did not inhibit the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and were therefore not developed further as antibacterial drugs. The inactivity of the LpxC inhibitors for P. aeruginosa raised the possibility that LpxC activity might not be essential for all gram-negative bacteria. By placing the lpxC gene of P. aeruginosa under tight control of an arabinose-inducible promoter, we demonstrated the essentiality of LpxC activity for P. aeruginosa. It was found that compound L- 161, 240, the most potent inhibitor from the previous study, was active against a P. aeruginosa construct in which the endogenous lpxC gene was inactivated and in which LpxC activity was supplied by the lpxC gene from E. coli. Conversely, an E. coli construct in which growth was dependent on the P. aeruginosa lpxC gene was resistant to the compound. The differential activities of L- 161, 240 against the two bacterial species are thus the result primarily of greater potency toward the E. coli enzyme rather than of differences in the intrinsic resistance of the bacteria toward antibacterial compounds due to permeability or efflux. These data validate P. aeruginosa LpxC as a target for novel antibiotic drugs and should help direct the design of inhibitors against clinically important gram-negative bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Local fibrinolytic {{activity}} is studied {{to explain the}} physiopathogenesis of chronic subdural hematoma. 1. Using FDP-kit (Wellcome, England), FDP levels in hematoma fluid and serum are determined in 15 cases with unilateral hematoma and a case with bilateral hematoma. The FDP values in all hematomas are higher than 20 μg/ml. Two cases show the FDP values over than 320 μg/ml. The FDP values in hematoma fluid is always higher than that in serum of the same patient. The FDP values in hematoma fluid correlate to the volume of hematoma in fluid type subdural hematomas. 2. The levels of fibrinolytic activity in hematoma fluid and plasma are determined in 12 cases with subdural hematoma by Enzo-diffusion fibrin plate (<b>Hyland,</b> U. <b>S.</b> A.). Active plasmin, available plasmin and total plasminogen in hematoma fluid are not found in all cases with subdural hematoma. The fibrinolytic activity in hematoma fluid is remarkably lower than that in plasma in all cases. Absence of plasminogen might be for consumption. 3. The amounts of tissue active plasmin in 7 cases and tissue plasminogen activator in 8 cases are measured by modified Astrup's method. Tissue active plasmin levels in dura maters, outer membranes and inner membranes are 3. 7 - 7. 2 mm (average 6. 1 mm), 4. 3 - 6. 5 mm (5. 5 mm) and 0 - 4. 8 mm (1. 7 mm), respectively. Tissue plasminogen activator levels in dura maters, outer membranes and inner membranes are 0 - 5. 5 mm (average 2. 7 mm), 3. 3 - 8. 1 mm (6. 1 mm) and 0 mm, respectively. The tissue activator level is highest in the outer membrane. 4. Fibrinolysis autography by Todd's method demonstrates the remarkable fibrinolysis around the vessels of outer membrane. The fibrinolysis in tissue increases with time. 5. After clotting of subdural hemorrhage, capsule (grows out) from the dura mater. Then tissue plasminogen activator in outer membrane would activate fibrinolytic system in order to absorb subdural clot. If the fibrinolytic {{activity is}} adequate, the clot could be absorbed. If the fibrinolytic activity is excess, it would inhibit the coagulating system in vessels of outer membrane and so that the continual or intermittent bleeding from outer membrane would occur into subdural cavity. As the result, the FDP levels in hematoma fluid increase and the amounts of plasminogen decrease for consumption. Such fibrinolytic bleeding from outer membrane of hematoma induces gradually the enlargement of hematoma and clinical symptoms appear after a latent interval...|$|R
40|$|Peer {{feedback}} {{has been}} widely accepted as in English as second language classroom, although it was originally used in the first language classroom in North America during the 1970 <b>s</b> (<b>Hyland</b> and Hyland, 2006). Researchers have revealed that peer feedback has influential impact on the students’ learning achievement and development of their language skills. In English as Second Language writing classroom, peer feedback is strongly advocated based on the research result. However, peer feedback effectiveness until this day is still hotly debated. Peer feedback {{is said to have}} advantages in one hand and drawbacks in the other hand (Williams, 2005; Spear, 1988; Lim, 2007; Lee, 2009). Various issues regarding peer feedback in ESL writing are reviewed. It must be acknowledged that the available empirical evidence is limited. That is why this research is then conducted. This research investigated the impact of peer feedback in the students’ narrative writing and the students’ responses toward peer feedback activity in the ESL writing classroom. 15 undergraduate students were purposively selected to participate in this research. Students’ texts were collected through two cycles of peer feedback, {{and at the end of}} the research process, students were interviewed to gather their responses toward peer feedback in which they were engaged. By using content analysis on students’ narrative texts, it was indicated that the students’ narrative writing developed organizationally and grammatically; whereas data from the interview suggested that the students positively welcome peer feedback in the ESL writing classroom. However, it was also found that there are difficulties in doing peer feedback. Mostly, difficulties the students encountered are caused by the limitation of students’ language competence. This causes some unobserved mistakes in their drafts left uncorrected through peer feedback. This recommends that in implementing peer feedback, especially in ESL classroom, students’ background knowledge should be taken into consideration...|$|R
