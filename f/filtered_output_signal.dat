40|$|Abstract. Speech-based command {{interfaces}} {{are becoming}} more and more common in cars. Applications include automatic dialog systems for hands-free phone calls as well as more advanced features such as navigation systems. However, interferences, such as speech from the codriver, can greatly hamper the performance of the speech recognition component, which is crucial for those applications. This issue can be addressed with adaptive interference cancellation techniques such as the Generalized Sidelobe Canceller (GSC). In order to cancel the interference (codriver) while not cancelling the target (driver), adaptation must happen only when the interference is active and dominant. To that purpose, this paper proposes two efficient adaptation control methods called “implicit ” and “explicit”. The “implicit ” method adapts the filter coefficients continuously, the speed of adaptation being determined by the energy of the <b>filtered</b> <b>output</b> <b>signal.</b> The “explicit” method decides whether to adapt or not in a binary fashion, depending on prior estimation of target and interference energies. A major contribution of this paper is a direct, robust method for such estimation, directly derived from sector-based detection and localization techniques. Experiments on real in-car data validate both adaptation methods, including a case with 100 km/h background road noise. 2 IDIAP–RR 04 - 6...|$|E

To investigate the impact of new driver assistance systems on driver behavior different research facilities from simulations to real car environments are used. One research facility at TS is the dy-namic driving simulator with a hexapod structure. Using dynamic driving simulators to reproduce real car motion is a major challenge as the workspace is limited.

Recently many computational approaches of auditory scene analysis (ASA) address the speech separation problem using the property of auditory masking, and they estimate a time-frequency mask based on monaural and binaural cues such as localization, pitch, and precedence effect. Roman and Wang [1] trained a filter which cancels a target signal in the absence of interference and measured output-to-input energy ratio to estimate the ideal binary mask. Shamsoddini and Denbigh [2] tried an interesting approach that combines the methods of directional masking and the pitch enhancement. They observed that the direction cue can be distorted by multipath echoes from room surfaces and the pitch determination can be very difficult with multiple voiced sounds. Their hybrid system utilize the directional masking to estimate target and interfering speeches. Subsequent processing of pitch enhancement provides further reductions in the interference during voiced sounds. Palomaki et al. [3] used a simple precedence model to consider the reverberation effect in a small room and they improved speech recognition accuracy with missing data speech recognizer.
