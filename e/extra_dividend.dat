In Automatic Self-Cleansing Filter Syndicate Co Ltd v Cuninghame, a shareholder sued the board for not following a resolution, carried with an ordinary majority of votes, to sell off the company's assets.

Shareholders always have the option of gaining the votes to change the constitution or threaten directors with removal, but they may not sidestep the separation of powers found in the company constitution. Though older cases raise an element of uncertainty, the majority opinion is that other provisions of a company's constitution generate personal rights that may be enforced by company members individually. Of the most important is a member's right to vote at meetings. Votes need not necessarily attach to shares, as preferential shares [...] (e.g., [...] those with <b>extra</b> <b>dividend</b> rights) are frequently non-voting.

40|$|Private equity {{firms are}} blamed for quickly extracting {{all of a}} target company’s cash, and {{sometimes}} for going even further by requesting a target company to incur additional debts – {{in order to be}} able to pay investors an additional dividend – and thus driving it into bankruptcy. Consequently, there is always a trade-off between the benefit of high <b>extra</b> <b>dividends</b> and the associated risk, due to higher debt obligations, which may cause bankruptcy. In this paper, we apply real-options theory and capital-budgeting techniques to the problem of assessing a private investor’s risk. We propose a new continuous time DCF model, which incorporates the four fundamental value drivers, among others a high debt to equity ratio, and typical characteristics for private investments like a high probability to default. We also introduce different risk measures by proposing a new measurement model that is based on the cash flow process, the associated multiple process as well as on the implied IRR of the transaction. Finally, we give some details of how such a model is implemented to provide investors as well as debt lenders with a decision support regarding different investments or investments strategies...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates macro-level {{explanations}} for why firms pay special dividends. The {{evidence shows that}} both market conditions and stages of the business cycle affect the propensity and abnormal returns of special dividend announcements. However, business cycle variations have economically larger impact on these events. Firms {{are more likely to}} announce special dividends in market or economic downturns rather than upturns. They tend to use additional cash for business growth in expansions and distribute it to reduce agency costs in contractions. The signalling effect of special dividend distributions is stronger and the companies with these announcements are better performers in recessions. This research sheds light on the reasons why we observe corporate events happening in waves and enhances the understanding of why firms disburse <b>extra</b> cash <b>dividends</b> at the aggregate level...|$|R

Elliott, which has a 3.25% stake in the company, claimed it was {{one of a group of}} investors that met the Dutch legal threshold of 10% voting-share support, which is needed to call an extraordinary meeting to vote on a proposal to remove Burgmans. On April 13, Templeton Global Equity said it was among another group of investors calling for an extraordinary meeting of AkzoNobel shareholders to discuss Burgmans continued tenure as Chairman. Later, in the same month Akzo outlined its plan to separate its chemicals division and pay shareholders €1.6 billion in <b>extra</b> <b>dividends,</b> in order to attempt to hold-off PPG. The new Akzo strategy was dismissed by PPG, which claimed that their offer represented better value for shareholders, supported by activist Akzo shareholder, Elliot Advisors. On April 24, a day before Akzo's annual meeting of shareholders, PPG increased its final offer by approximately 8% to $28.8 billion (€26.9 billion, €96.75 per share) - with Akzo's share pricing rising 6% to a record price of €82.95 per share. Akzo shareholder, Columbia Threadneedle Investments, urged the company to open dialogue with PPG, whilst PPG claimed that the deal would add to earning within its first year. Days later one of Great Britain's largest pension scheme investors, Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), urged Akzo to engage with PPG. On 2 May, Reuters revealed that the supervisory board of Azko was meeting to discuss how to deal with PPGs third offer, still maintaining it did not value the company highly enough.|$|R
25|$|Companies {{limited by}} shares also acquire finance through ‘equity’ (a synonym for the share capital). Shares differ from debt in that {{shareholders}} rank last in insolvency. The main justification for shareholders’ residual claim is that, unlike many creditors (though not large banks) {{they are capable}} of diversifying their portfolio. Taxation of profits on shares can also be treated differently with a different tax rate (under the Income Tax Act 2007) to capital gains tax on debt (which falls under the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992). This makes the distinction between shares and debt important. In principle, all forms of debt and equity arise from contractual arrangements with a company, and the rights which attach are a question of construction. For instance, in Scottish Insurance Corp Ltd v Wilsons & Clyde Coal Co Ltd the House of Lords held that when the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946 was passed, preferential shareholders were entitled to no extra, special share of assets upon winding up: construction of the terms of the shares entitled them to <b>extra</b> <b>dividends,</b> but without special words to the contrary, shareholders were presumed equal otherwise. For anyone to become a member of a company under the Companies Act 2006 section 33, the contract for shares must simply manifest the intention to do so. However, beyond this, the dividing line between shares and debt is more a matter of standard practice than law. It is legally possible to {{become a member of the}} company without being a shareholder, simply by being accepted and registered on the members’ register. It is also possible to be a shareholder without being a member immediately. It is standard practice that shareholders have one vote per share, but occasionally shareholders (particularly those with preferential dividend rights) do not have votes, and debt holders and others may have votes without having shares. It is even possible for creditors to contract to be subordinated behind shareholders in insolvency – it is just unlikely, and strongly discouraged by the regulatory framework. Shares are also presumed to be transferable to other people, although like other rights, the right to trade is subject to the company’s constitution.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} {{explanations for the}} aggregate corporate activities of stock split and special dividend announcements in the United States (US) listed firms between 1926 and 2008. The study is motivated by the limitation of understanding of {{these two types of}} events, which have previously only been focused at the firm-specific level. Further, by studying stock splits and special dividends, this research seeks to find an answer to the debate regarding explanations of corporate event waves between neoclassical efficiency reasons and modern market-timing hypothesis. The study is also motivated by the lack of a link between the extensively documented January Effect and Halloween Effect in stock markets and corporate practice. In addition to the contribution of the extended dataset provided in this research, the study has examined corporate decisions to announce stock splits and special dividends from a macro-perspective, especially in relation to market-timing opportunities, economic efficiency reasons, and calendar monthly effects. Chapter 1 is the introduction of this dissertation. Chapter 2 provides a comprehensive critical literature review on this topic. Chapter 3 is the research framework, hypothesis development, data and methodology used in this research. Chapter 4 is the initial results of the patterns and frequencies for stock split and special dividend announcements. Chapter 5 first investigates whether market conditions and investor sentiment affect the aggregate activities of stock splits and special dividends. These findings indicate that firms time the market to split shares during bull markets with positive and increasing sentiment to achieve higher abnormal returns. On the other hand, special dividend distributions are more likely to happen in bear markets when sentiment decreases. Firms paying special dividends in bear markets are better performers than their counterparts in bull markets. Chapter 6 then examines whether stock split and special dividend activities are driven by the business cycle. Stock splits are more likely to happen in the economic growth stage rather than in the mature stage. On the contrary, firms tend to distribute <b>extra</b> cash <b>dividends</b> to alleviate agency problems in economic declines when profitable investment opportunities are low. Chapter 7 explores the relationship between the patterns of stock splits and special dividend announcements and the calendar anomalies of the January Effect and the Halloween Effect. Firms are more likely to split shares in January and Halloween period than in other months of a year. However, firms have a commonality to pay special dividends to their shareholders in November and December. Lastly, Chapter 8 assesses which macro-determinant has the strongest explanatorypower on stock splits and special dividend activities, and the results show that the businesscycle effect is the quantitatively strongest along with all the additional and robustness checks. Chapter 9 is the conclusion and remarks of this dissertation, including future research ideas in the related areas...|$|R
