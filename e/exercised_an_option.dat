5|$|Edmonton’s native Magic Lantern Theatres {{unexpectedly}} {{tried to}} buy the Princess for $500,000 on Christmas Eve 1996. A condition in the Brar's contract stated that the sale could be voided if another party bid at least ten percent more for the building. However, the Brars <b>exercised</b> <b>an</b> <b>option</b> to match any higher bids, and the sale went through in early January 1997.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 Sheffield City Council {{negotiated}} with Yorkshire Water and leased an unused {{part of the}} former sewage works for 99 years, at an annual rent of one peppercorn, to enable it to be reclaimed {{and turned into a}} nature reserve. In order to manage the project, a consortium was formed, with representation from Sheffield City Council, Sheffield Wildlife Trust, South Yorkshire Forest and Yorkshire Water. It now provides habitat for migrating birds, for which it is an area of European significance. The Wildlife Trust run an active programme of school education visits. In 2005 the City Council <b>exercised</b> <b>an</b> <b>option</b> to increase the size of the reserve by taking over additional land from Yorkshire Water.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Ernest Thompson <b>exercised</b> <b>an</b> <b>option</b> of his lease {{allowing}} him to buy Craigiehall from Lord Rosebery. However, the army had still not moved out, and in 1948 offered to purchase the property from Thompson, finally completing the sale in 1951. Through the early 1950s the Army made alterations to Craigiehall. The original roof was replaced in 1953 due to woodworm, and extra rooms added in the attic. This resulted {{in the loss of}} Bruce's chimneys, and Burn's dining room pediment. Internally the house was redecorated, it being considered that there was too little of the original scheme remaining to allow restoration. Another extension was added, this time to the north-west, to house the staff of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC) in Scotland.|$|E

25|$|While UPN {{was still}} airing new episodes of Girlfriends, the network also began airing reruns five days per week. When the show moved to The CW network after UPN merged with The WB network, MyNetwork TV (which {{was created to}} take over UPN's former {{affiliate}} stations) picked up the rights to air reruns of Girlfriends, although they eventually discontinued this. WE tv, a network with primarily women's programming, later acquired exclusive rights to air the limited-release episodes on Sundays and <b>exercised</b> <b>an</b> <b>option</b> to not allow broadcast television networks re-broadcast rights to these reruns.|$|E
25|$|On April 22, 2014, the NFL {{announced}} that it had <b>exercised</b> <b>an</b> <b>option</b> in ESPN's recent contract extension for Monday Night Football rights to air a first-round Wild Card playoff game on the channel after {{the conclusion of the}} 2014 season. This {{was the first time that}} an NFL playoff game was ever broadcast exclusively on cable television in the United States, in lieu of any of the league's broadcast network partners. The MNF broadcast team of Mike Tirico, Jon Gruden and sideline reporter Lisa Salters called the game, the first of the 2014–15 NFL playoffs. The Carolina Panthers defeated the Arizona Cardinals 27–16. As with all MNF games, the matchup was simulcast on WJZY in Charlotte and KASW in the Phoenix market to allow local viewers over-the-air access to the game.|$|E
25|$|On August 10, 1985, after Time Inc. {{and cable}} {{provider}} Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI) jointly submitted {{a bid to}} buy the company for $900 million and the assumption of $500 million in debt {{as well as an}} earlier offer by American Express the previous month to buy out Warner's share of the company (under a clause in the agreement that allowed either company the option of buying out their partner's stake in Warner-Amex), Warner Communications <b>exercised</b> <b>an</b> <b>option</b> to acquire American Express' 50% share of Warner-Amex Cable Communications for $450 million. Among the options, barring that it chose to sell Viacom a 50% interest in the company for $450 million, the deal originally excluded Warner-Amex's 19% interest in Showtime-The Movie Channel, Inc.; that interest would have reverted to Warner, which intended to operate Warner-Amex as a wholly owned subsidiary.|$|E

500|$|The Roughriders offered Speedie double his Browns salary as the Canadian leagues {{tried to}} make names for {{themselves}} by signing top-level NFL players. Paul Brown refused to match the offer, and Speedie, who was making $11,000 per year with the Browns, joined the Canadian team for the 1953 season. Brown then threatened to sue Speedie for violating his existing contract with the team, saying the Browns had <b>exercised</b> <b>an</b> <b>option</b> to extend the deal after it expired {{in the summer of}} 1953. [...] "This was a case of jumping a contract, pure and simple, as this young man morally and ethically had a contract with us", Brown said at the time. Speedie later said that Brown [...] "told me when I jumped leagues {{that he was going to}} get even with me".|$|E

5000|$|<b>A</b> put <b>option</b> {{is said to}} have {{intrinsic}} value when the underlying instrument has a spot price (S) below the option's strike price (K). Upon <b>exercise,</b> <b>a</b> put <b>option</b> is valued at K-S if it is [...] "in-the-money", otherwise its value is zero. Prior to <b>exercise,</b> <b>an</b> <b>option</b> has time value apart from its {{intrinsic value}}. The following factors reduce the time value of a put option: shortening of the time to expire, decrease in the volatility of the underlying, and increase of interest rates. <b>Option</b> pricing is <b>a</b> central problem of financial mathematics.|$|R
2500|$|Also in 1936, Crosby <b>exercised</b> <b>an</b> <b>option</b> from Paramount {{to make a}} film out-of-house. Quickly {{signed to}} a one-picture {{agreement}} with Columbia, Crosby dreamt of having his icon and friend Louis Armstrong, an African-American, who largely influenced his singing style, in a screen adaptation of The Peacock Feather called Pennies from Heaven. Crosby talked to Harry Cohn about the matter, but he disagreed saying: [...] "...no reason to entail the expense of flying him in and having no desire to negotiate with Armstrong's crude, mob-linked but devoted manager, Joe Glaser." [...] Bing threatened to walk out on the film and refused to discuss it with Cohn. Armstrong's musical scenes, along with some comical dialogue as well, heightened his career. Bing also had it that Armstrong made high billing alongside his white co-stars, one of the first times ever for a black performer in a wide-audience film. He starred as himself in many more films to come and had a large appreciation for Bing's unracist views, often thanking him in his later years.|$|E
2500|$|The year 2000 brought {{heightened}} {{interest in}} the AFL. Then-St. Louis Rams quarterback Kurt Warner, who was MVP of Super Bowl XXXIV, was first noticed because he played quarterback for the AFL's Iowa Barnstormers. While many sports commentators and fans continued to ridicule the league, Warner's story gave the league positive exposure, and it brought the league a new television deal with TNN, which, unlike ESPN, televised regular season games live. While it was not financially lucrative, it helped {{set the stage for}} what the league would become in the new millennium. Also, the year also brought a spin-off league, the af2, intended to be a developmental league, comparable to the National Football League's NFL Europe. There was a lot of expansion in the 2000s. Expansion teams included the Austin Wranglers, Carolina Cobras, Los Angeles Avengers, Chicago Rush, Detroit Fury, Dallas Desperados, Colorado Crush, New Orleans VooDoo, Philadelphia Soul, Nashville Kats, Kansas City Brigade, New York Dragons and Utah Blaze. [...] Some of these teams, including the Crush, Desperados, Kats, and VooDoo, were owned for at least part of their existence by the same group which owned the NFL teams in their host cities. [...] The NFL purchased, but never <b>exercised,</b> <b>an</b> <b>option</b> to buy a major interest the AFL. Of all of these teams, only the Philadelphia Soul survives.|$|E
