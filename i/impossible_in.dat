5|$|As {{the closest}} planet to Earth, Venus {{has been a}} prime target for early interplanetary exploration. It was the first planet beyond Earth visited by a {{spacecraft}} (Mariner 2 in 1962), {{and the first to}} be successfully landed on (by Venera 7 in 1970). Venus's thick clouds render observation of its surface <b>impossible</b> <b>in</b> visible light, and the first detailed maps did not emerge until the arrival of the Magellan orbiter in 1991. Plans have been proposed for rovers or more complex missions, but they are hindered by Venus's hostile surface conditions.|$|E

5|$|About 17.8 percent——of {{the total}} forested area of Vietnam was sprayed during the war, which {{disrupted}} the ecological equilibrium. The persistent nature of dioxins, erosion caused by loss of tree cover, {{and loss of}} seedling forest stock meant that reforestation was difficult (or <b>impossible)</b> <b>in</b> many areas. Many defoliated forest areas were quickly invaded by aggressive pioneer species (such as bamboo and cogon grass), making forest regeneration difficult and unlikely. Animal-species diversity was also impacted; in one study a Harvard biologist found 24 species of birds and five species of mammals in a sprayed forest, while in two adjacent sections of unsprayed forest there were 145 and 170 species of birds and 30 and 55 species of mammals.|$|E
5|$|After Byzantium, the Spartans were {{allegedly}} {{eager to}} end their involvement in the war. The Spartans were supposedly of the view that, with the liberation of mainland Greece and the Greek cities of Asia Minor, the war's purpose had already been reached. There was also perhaps a feeling that securing long-term security for the Asian Greeks would prove <b>impossible.</b> <b>In</b> the aftermath of Mycale, the Spartan king Leotychides had proposed transplanting all the Greeks from Asia Minor to Europe as the only method of permanently freeing them from Persian dominion. Xanthippus, the Athenian commander at Mycale, had furiously rejected this; the Ionian cities were originally Athenian colonies, and the Athenians, if no-one else, would protect the Ionians. This marks {{the point at which}} the leadership of the Greek Alliance effectively passed to the Athenians. With the Spartan withdrawal after Byzantium, the leadership of the Athenians became explicit.|$|E
5|$|By 1918, {{civilian}} morale in occupied Belgium {{reached an}} all-time low. The early {{successes of the}} Ludendorff Offensive {{in the spring of}} 1918 were believed to have made liberation virtually <b>impossible</b> <b>in</b> the foreseeable future. However, during the Hundred Days Offensive, the Allied and Belgian armies launched a series of successful offensives on the Western Front. The Belgian army, restricted to the Yser salient since 1914, advanced as far as Bruges. German forces on the front in Belgium launched a wide retreat. On 11 November 1918, the German army signed an armistice. The ceasefire did not, however, lead to the immediate liberation of Belgium and sporadic fighting continued. The Belgian army gradually advanced into the country, behind the evacuating German occupying force.|$|E

5|$|Grammars and {{dictionaries}} {{of indigenous}} languages were composed throughout the colonial period, but their quality was {{highest in the}} initial period. The friars found that learning all the indigenous languages was <b>impossible</b> <b>in</b> practice, so they concentrated on Nahuatl. For a time, the linguistic situation in Mesoamerica remained relatively stable, but in 1696, Charles II of Spain issued a decree banning {{the use of any}} language other than Spanish throughout the Spanish Empire. In 1770 another decree, calling for the elimination of the indigenous languages, did away with Classical Nahuatl as a literary language. Until Mexican Independence in 1821, the Spanish courts admitted Nahuatl testimony and documentation as evidence in lawsuits, with court translators rendering it in Spanish.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} preseason poll, however, {{speculation}} began {{as to whether}} regular-season parity would render the prediction irrelevant. Before the 2010 season, the poll had predicted the ACC winner correctly only once {{in the championship game}} era. In the Coastal Division, this speculation was groundless, as Virginia Tech's undefeated season rendered any other winner <b>impossible.</b> <b>In</b> the Atlantic Division, the situation was much different. As late as the second week of November, four of the six division teams were in contention for the division title. These candidates were whittled to three with two weeks remaining in the regular season, then to two in the final week. During that week, NC State traveled to Maryland. If NC State had won, {{it would have been the}} Atlantic Division winner by virtue of a tie-breaking win against Florida State. Instead, NC State lost 38–31, and Florida State earned a bid to the championship game.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the New Zealand attack progressed well, but the German {{defenders}} regained their composure and {{the attack}} lost momentum against heavily fortified defensive positions. By 21:00, the NZ 24th Infantry Battalion had fought {{its way in}} slow house to house fighting to {{the centre of the}} town, but were pinned down with no prospect of further progress without significant armoured support. However, a combination of concealed minefields and well dug in German armour made the task of the Allied tanks <b>impossible.</b> <b>In</b> the early hours of 8 December, the New Zealand commander—Bernard Freyberg—ordered a withdrawal from the town with a view to renewing the attack after further softening up from artillery and bombers.|$|E

5|$|Miller {{came in at}} {{the start}} of the second day's play and scored 34 of the next 48 runs added, before falling at 7/86, part of a {{collapse}} of 5/27. He hit two sixes in his innings, including one from the first ball that he faced, feeling that a defensive strategy would be almost <b>impossible</b> <b>in</b> the difficult conditions. Australia ended at 101, and Loxton was unable to bat due to injury. Frank Smailes had the best bowling figures for Yorkshire, 6/51. Yorkshire scored 89 in their second innings, which followed a similar pattern to their first effort. Wickets fell steadily as Johnston (6/18) and Miller (3/49) bowled 31.2 of the 36.2 overs.|$|E
5|$|Northcott {{spent much}} of his time from 1943 on in a long battle with the {{government}} over the number of men and women allocated to the Army. He attempted to do so without Blamey being dragged into a political fight but this proved to be <b>impossible.</b> <b>In</b> September 1944, the government reduced the Army's monthly intake of women from 925 to 500, while it only received 420 out of 4,020 men allocated to the three services. Such a meagre allocation was below what the Army needed to maintain its strength, and formations had to be disbanded. Blamey took up the matter with Prime Minister John Curtin, and managed to get a more satisfactory monthly allocation of 1,500 men per month out of 3,000 allocated to the three services.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} {{outbreak}} of the Warsaw Uprising in 1944, Mazurkiewicz was made commander of the Radosław Group. This force was one of the largest, best trained and equipped Polish units in the uprising. After the initiation of the uprising, the unit seized major portions of the Wola suburbs, and subsequently defended it against German attacks carried out by troops under the command of SS Gruppenführer Heinz Reinefarth and Standartenführer Oskar Dirlewanger. One of the battalions of the group, Battalion Zośka, liberated the Gęsiówka concentration camp located within Warsaw, and freed 384 prisoners (mainly Jews), most of whom then joined the unit. The Radosław Group fought its way to Stare Miasto (Warsaw Old Town) borough, when further defense in Wola became <b>impossible.</b> <b>In</b> the areas of Wola that Reinefarth's and Dirlewanger's troops recaptured from the insurgents, at least 40,000 civilians and prisoners of war (POWs) were murdered in the Wola massacre.|$|E

5|$|The court {{decided that}} it would be {{reasonably}} possible for a jury to convict Thomas based on the available evidence, so it then considered whether there were factors which would make a retrial unjust. Thomas' lawyer Lex Lasry argued that the delay in Thomas' prosecution (he was not arrested until seventeen months after he returned to Australia) and the extensive media coverage of the case meant it was unlikely Thomas would get a fair trial, and that a retrial would be an undue hardship on Thomas given that he has spent long periods in custody, mostly in solitary confinement, without conviction, which has led to him being diagnosed with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. The court was of the opinion that a fair trial was not <b>impossible</b> <b>in</b> these circumstances, and although the other factors were considered, the court ultimately decided that the circumstances did not preclude a retrial.|$|E

It would be <b>impossible,</b> <b>in</b> any event, to attempt the rescue before mid-July; ice conditions in the Arctic that year were reported as severe. After receiving permission, Bear, with Bartlett aboard, left St Michael on 13 July; the ship had many calls to make along the Alaskan coast before she could proceed with the rescue. On 5 August, at Port Hope, Bartlett met with Kataktovik and gave him his expedition wages and a new suit of clothing. At Point Barrow on 21 August Bartlett encountered Burt McConnell, Stefansson's erstwhile secretary, who gave details of Stefansson's movements after leaving Karluk the previous September. In April 1914, McConnell reported, Stefansson had headed north with two companions, searching for new lands.|$|E
