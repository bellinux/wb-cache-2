40|$|It {{would be}} {{safe to say that}} one of the next big animal welfare issues for swine will be <b>dry</b> <b>sow</b> housing. Many {{countries}} have already started to change the way sows are housed. Most noticeable is the ban on <b>dry</b> <b>sow</b> stalls in the UK. Canadian swine producers can not get caught dismissing this trend. There are organizations already at work to try and change the use of <b>dry</b> <b>sow</b> stalls. Although legislation is unlikely in Canada, pressure on large food suppliers by consumer groups or special interest groups is already happening. Group housing systems have taken hold in Canada and there are many systems that have shown success. This is no longer new technology, and Canadian producers should be looking at implementing some of the loose housing practices before it is imposed on them. By no means is a dry stall ban the answer. In fact, <b>dry</b> <b>sow</b> stalls help in the welfare of the animal being raised. A proactive approach, by producers, in finding an alternative is the best solution. If Canadian producers were to research, design and implement a new sow housing protocol that is good for the sow and the producer, which incorporates both stalls and loose housing, then consumer groups and special interest groups will have a more difficult task implementing their agenda...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results {{from a series of}} studies related to factors influencing fertility of sows in New Zealand. The conclusion from an analysis of longitudinal pig reproductive performance data is that summer-autumn infertility was not a significant problem on the farms included in this study during the time period investigated. In New Zealand there are probably certain specific conditions when seasonal infertility does become a problem for a particular pig herd, and this may be more evident on farms in the South Island which are using a group housing husbandry system for their sows. The intervention trials into increased <b>dry</b> <b>sow</b> ration in newly mated sows and of the management technique of split weaning both failed to demonstrate these techniques improved reproductive performance. Economic simulation modelling suggests that while there {{does not seem to be}} an overall benefit from the increased <b>dry</b> <b>sow</b> feed intake, it would yield an economic benefit on some farms. Possible explanations for this are discussed in this thesis. The investigation into the usefulness of ultrasound scanning for determining early pregnancy status in sows demonstrated the effectiveness of this diagnostic technique in detecting pregnancy, but did not show a level of loss of early pregnancies sufficient to justify more intensive investigation of embryonic mortality. Cull sows sent to slaughter were examined for their pregnancy status and any pathological changes. A large proportion of these animals showed endometritis and urinary tract pathology, indicating that both of these conditions were more common in the cooperating herds than had been suggested by earlier clinical evidence...|$|E
40|$|Concentrations and {{emissions}} of airborne endotoxins and microorganisms within and from 160 piggery buildings were surveyed in four states of Australia. Respirable dust samples collected on filter {{papers in the}} buildings {{were used to determine}} endotoxin concentrations. The total airborne microorganisms were measured using six-stage Andersen sampler. A refereed methodology was used to predict the emission rates from all buildings studied. An overall mean microorganism emission rate of 1. 6 × 107 cfu/h/pig and a mean internal building concentration of 1. 17 × 105 cfu/m 3 were measured in the piggery buildings. An overall mean emission rate of 3. 31 × 103 EU/h/pig and a mean internal concentration of 33. 1 Endotoxin Units (EU) Zm 3 were measured for respirable endotoxins. The lowest endotoxin concentrations were measured in <b>dry</b> <b>sow</b> buildings (23. 3 EU/m 3), while measurements taken in straw based shelters had the highest concentrations (84. 98 EU/m 3).

40|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>sowing</b> is a {{practice}} {{used in many}} semiarid agricultural systems where crops are planted early into dry soil to hasten crop emergence following the first rains of the season. This practice increases water use effi ciency by promoting rapid canopy development early in the growing season when soils are warm. The question that arises from this practice is whether the effi cacy of fertilizers, which are usually simultaneously placed below the seed at planting, is infl uenced by being {{in contact with the}} dry soil {{for a period of time}} before seed germination and crop emergence.

This paper evaluates two parameters, degradability (BO) and apparent first order hydrolysis rate coefficient (khyd) from 5 different sites (one sampled twice), and six different pig growth stages. Hydrolysis rate was not significantly influenced by the production stage and was statistically similar at 0. 1 d- 1 and ranged from 0. 06 d- 1 to 0. 3 d- 1. However, degradability, as defined by estimated ultimate methane yield (referenced to standard temperature and pressure) per kg organics loaded varied substantially. Specifically, we found that the methane yields (per unit organic substrate (volatile solids) added) from finisher (470 ± 170 L kg- 1), weaner (450 ± 150 L kg- 1) and grower (460 ± 160 L kg- 1) effluent streams were more compared to yields from <b>dry</b> <b>sow</b> (260 ± 120 L kg- 1) and farrowing streams (380 ± 160 L kg- 1).

At the first visit 4 different plasmid profile types of DT 104 and DT 104 B were found in breeding stock and in weaner and finishing pigs. Most isolates were resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulphonamide, neomycin and trimethroprim. Some isolates were also resistant to ampramycin. S. Livingstone, S. Derby and S.

40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} take a holistic approach to assessing <b>dry</b> <b>sow</b> welfare in relation to gestation accommodation. Multiple factors that affect the welfare of a sow were considered. In addition, the multitude of systems in New Zealand {{that are used to}} accommodate dry sows in groups were captured. Commercial pig farms (n= 20 farms, 7, 912 sows total) were chosen to represent the spectrum of different layouts and management practices in order to obtain data {{from a wide range of}} different systems. During each on-farm visit, data concerning housing, management, sow behaviour, welfare and productivity were collected. A number of criteria were used to describe the farms (group size, stall duration, presence of bedding, feeding method, feeding frequency). Sows kept in stalls for more than 5 weeks (n = 3 farms) had significantly higher injury scores than sows that were in stalls for a shorter length of time or sows that were not kept in stalls for any period during mating or pregnancy. Sows fed twice daily had significantly higher stereotypies (P< 0. 05) than those fed at a different frequency. A welfare index (WI) was calculated for each farm. This index incorporated each farm‟s total scores for injuries, stereotypies, coat condition, soiling and lameness. A low WI represented a lower presence of indicators that were associated with compromises to welfare. Hence, a low WI represented good welfare. For each farm, the minimum possible WI was 0. 33, whilst the maximum possible WI was 5. 0. The mean WI was 0. 65 (± 0. 14 SD). Overall, there was not a high prevalence of indicators of compromised welfare. Out of the 20 farms, with an average herd size of 395. 60 sows per farm; only 10 sows in total were lame. Only three farms had sows with a coat condition score above 0 (normal). There was no difference between mean piglets born alive per litter (BA) for stalls (12. 65 ± 0. 36) vs. group housed sows for the entire gestation (12. 27 ± 0. 43), or for the number of piglets weaned per sow per year (stalls: 23. 70 ± 0. 59 W/S/Y, groups: 24. 92 ± 1. 23 W/S/Y). As a result of this study, it is clear that there is no perfect or ideal system for keeping dry sows, because a sow‟s needs change throughout different stages of the production cycle. Therefore the implication is that in any housing system, both the advantages and disadvantages relating to a sow‟s welfare will also change over time. In light of this, operators need to understand the variation both between and within systems and how best to manage them...|$|E

The lowest germination percentage (27. 9 %) and tuber number/m 2 (222. 3) were obtained in the 15 th September sown crop where as the lowest yield of seedling tubers/m 2 was produced by the Ist. November sown plots (1822. 2 g). Maximum germination percentage (79. 8 %), seedling tubers/m 2 (326. 1) and yield of seedling tubers/m 2 (1835 g) was obtained in plot where soil and leaf manure was mixed in 1 : 1 ratio, where as minimum germination percentage (41. 6 %), seedling tubers/m 2 (254. 3) and yield of seedling tubers/m 2 (684 g) was recorded where TPS was sown in simple soil.

40|$|Measures of production, physiology, {{behaviour}} and pathology {{were used}} to assess the effects of confined and loose <b>dry</b> <b>sow</b> and farrowing housing systems on the welfare of the sow and her litter. Litter size decreased and piglet mortality increased greatly after the sixth parity, regardless of housing system, resulting in a sharp {{decline in the number of}} piglets weaned per litter. Stall-housed sows gave birth to the most piglets per sow per year, but also had the highest piglet mortality. Overall, piglet mortality was higher in farrowing pens than in crates. Sows from the large group had a significantly larger number of returns to service after farrowing in crates. Behaviourally, all sows adapted well to the farrowing house. All sows showed an increase in the number of posture changes, reaching a maximum during the 24 hours immediately prior to parturition. However, this increase was greatest in those sows in farrowing crates, which had previously been housed in an open environment. Heart rate was influenced by stage of gestation, posture and behaviour. Stall-housed sows had a higher basal heart rate and heart rate response to feeding than group-housed sows, perhaps indicating decreased cardiovascular fitness and an increased sympathetic nervous response to stimuli such as food. When farrowing in crates, group-housed sows had a higher heart rate response to the suckling event than stall-housed sows. This may be due to general unresponsiveness in stalled sows or to high reactivity to the suckling event in group sows caused by frustration of mother-infant interaction. When involved in agonistic interactions, the change in heart rate was greatest for sows which lost a physical interaction. Stall-housed sows had weaker bones than group-housed sows, and different muscular conformation, probably due to lack of exercise. Bone and muscle weakness may increase the susceptibility of stall-housed sows to lameness. When lying down, stall-housed sows had greater difficulty and took longer than group-housed sows. The times taken for stall sows to lie down and to stand up quickly were positively correlated with body length. For group-housed sows lying down in the open, the time taken was positively correlated with proportional locomotory muscle weight. Spatial restriction when lying resulted in the loss of muscular control. There was a positive correlation between body length and the number of piglets crushed for stallhoused sows and group-housed sows farrowing in crates. There was also a positive correlation between body length and crushing mortality for group-housed sows farrowing in pens. This indicates that sows can have problems controlling movements, even in the presence of piglets. The results presented reveal several welfare problems resulting from stall housing during pregnancy. It would appear unreasonable to confine sows during farrowing, if they have previously been housed in an open environment. However, not enough is known about the causes of piglet mortality and any decision concerning the continued use of farrowing crates must take account of the trade-off between sow welfare and piglet welfare.

40|$|In general, {{problems}} such as lameness, claw injuries and claw infections very commonly occur in sow housing, and are a primary cause of culling, especially among young animals. The culling of young animals is a large economic burden in pig production, and therefore it is of great importance to try to reduce problems related to claw health. In addition, claw injuries also lead to {{a significant amount of}} suffering for the animals, which is not in accordance with good animal welfare. Previous studies have shown an increased prevalence of claw health problems in housing systems where limited amounts of straw are given, and where there are slatted floors in the dung area of the pens. These conditions must be taken into consideration, since these pen types will soon be the most prevalent in modern Swedish pig production. In this study, the importance of straw for the occurrence of claw injuries, sow activity, pen hygiene, and animal well-being was studied in the pen system described above. All studies were carried out on gestating sows housed in <b>dry</b> <b>sow</b> pens of the type ” 2 rooms” (Figure 1), with liquid feed, trough feeding with trough dividers, and without being locked in during feeding times. A total of 24 pens were studied in three trials. In half of the studied <b>dry</b> <b>sow</b> pens (12 control pens, or 4 pens per trial), a small amount of straw was given (approx 200 g per sow per day), whereas {{the other half of the}} pens (12 study pens, or 4 pens per trial) received a larger amount of straw (approx 1000 g per sow per day). The straw was given after the morning feeding. The claw health of the animals was documented using claw studies carried out when they first entered the pen, and when they left the gestation unit. A total of 99 sows were examined in this study. For these studies, the sow was placed in a sow cradle (Figure 2) where the legs could be lifted individually, cleaned with a brush, water, and claw knife, and the claws examined. The observations were carried out using the same method and according to the same protocol as previously described. At the same time as the claw studies, observations were made of scratches/injuries and bites on the examined sows. In addition, the eating order of the sows was noted at three different times during their stay in the gestation unit. The sow that first left the trough at feeding times was given an eating order point of 1 (short time at the trough), while the sow that stayed the longest at the trough was given an eating order point of 3 (long time at the trough). The sows were also videotaped for 24 h to determine their activity and location in the pen. In addition, 2 h manual behaviour studies were carried out at times during their stay in these pens. In these studies, the presence of stereotypies in the group was especially noted (“chewing/biting the bars”, “chewing saliva”, “rolling the tongue”, and “licking the floor”). Hygiene level and cleanliness of the pens were evaluated using hygiene studies. Each pen was divided into 8 areas (Figure 3), and an evaluation of the amount of moisture and dirtiness were carried out using two parallel 3 -point scales. The results of the claw studies (combining all the claw injuries), bites and scratches, and the 24 -h studies of animal activity, were analysed statistically using the GLM procedure in SAS. The occurrence of claw injuries was analysed using a statistical model containing the following factors: amount of straw bedding, litter number, trial number, injuries, and eating order points at feeding. In the statistical model for the analysis of the sow activity/location during the entire day, the factors amount of straw and litter number were used. The amount of straw was the factor in the model for bites and scratches. For the other observations (occurrence of stereotypies, and the pen cleanliness studies, only the frequency and the mean were calculated. The claw studies showed the occurrence of 6 types of injuries: cracks in the claw wall, overgrown heel, white line injuries, injury to the border of the heel/toe, or toe injuries. Certain injury types occurred more often together with other types of injuries than others did. In Table 1, the significant correlations between the different injuries at entering the gestation unit are shown, and in Table 2 the significant correlations when leaving the unit. Cracks in the claw wall and white line injuries, and heel injuries and overgrown heels, respectively, appeared to occur at the same time. The statistical analyses were carried out on both the total material (that is, all sows) and on a portion of the material, consisting of those sows missing or which had minor wounds upon entering the gestation unit. The analyses of the total material (Table 3, Figure 5) showed that the older sows (litter number > 4) incurred significantly fewer claw injuries during gestation than the young animals did) In general, no other factor in the model was significant. However, it was noted that the sows having serious claw injuries already upon entering the unit did not tend to show an increase in these injuries as much as sows having no or light injuries upon entering did (Table 3, Figure 6). In pens with the larger straw ration, a nominally lower increase in the number of injuries on the sows was found in comparison to those occurring on sows housed in pens with the lower straw ration. This was true for all types of injuries (Figure 4). The results of the statistical analyses for sows with no or light injuries are presented in Table 4. When the animals with the more serious injuries were not included in the analyses, the effect of the amount of straw present was greatly increased, although not enough to reach significance, whereas the p-value for litter number increased somewhat. The incidence of bites and scratches generally decreased to some extent during the stay in the gestation unit (Table 5). This decrease was greatest on animals in the pens with the larger straw ration, but the difference in comparison with animals in the lower straw ration was not significant. The presence of a larger straw ration also appeared to have reduced the occurrence of stereotypies (Table 8) among the sows. The sows given the larger straw ration were observed to be lying down somewhat more in the dung area (Table 6), especially the older animals (Table 7). An interpretation of this result could be that the floor heated lying area with the larger amounts of straw at times was “too warm” for the sows. Generally, no differences in activity between the two groups of animals could be detected (Tables 6, 7). The effect of the amount of straw on pen moisture and cleanliness is given in Figures 7 and 8. The lying area was observed to be somewhat less damp and cleaner in pens given the larger straw ration. On the other hand, the larger amounts of straw were more difficult to press down through the slatted flooring, and as a result the pens were wetter and less clean in the dung area. In summary, the studies showed that the size of the straw bedding ration clearly had a positive effect on the prevalence of claw injuries, and that the use of plenty of straw bedding was also of importance for the welfare of the sows. The results of the studies are interpreted so that it should be possible to reduce the problem with claw injuries, which is often seen in pens with slatted floors and relatively small areas for the animal, by increasing the amount of the straw bedding. This method is also considered to be a better way of preventing problems with claw injuries than by replacing the slatted flooring in those types of pens (that is, in gestation pens for well-established sow groups) with solid flooring. In previous studies, changing the slatted floors to solid floors in gestation pens for dry sows did not show any large effect on claw health. The comparison and evaluation of housing systems is often difficult to carry out, because various factors must be considered at the same time to obtain an evaluation of the entire system. In this type of evaluation, it is common that the different parameters considered have different “weights” or importance. For example, often building costs are more important for the producer’s choice of housing system than what the system can mean for animal health and welfare, for animal handling, the working environment, the effect on the environment, etc. Different producers also have different considerations depending upon economics, their interests, and their viewpoints with respect to production and the future. Irrespective of what weight is put on the parameter animal health and welfare, it can, however, be proven that in the long-term viewpoint these factors are of great importance for production economy. A low incidence of disease and durable animals are important ingredients for a strongly competitive and enduring production. This study has shown that an abundant straw ration, as a specific factor, appears to be of great importance in ameliorating some of the animal health and welfare problems which can occur in some types of intensive housing systems. In general, the study also showed that perhaps it is not sufficient to indicate that the animal should have access to straw as a bedding material. The amount of straw available is also important and must therefore be more precisely defined...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} feeding {{schedule}} on ammonia emission from housing,systems for sows was studied. The hypothesis was that changing the feeding schedule {{would change the}} diurnal pattern of the ammonia emission and that daytime feeding would cause more ammonia to be emitted from the manure compared to evening feeding. The experimental units were an individual housing system with 64 <b>dry</b> <b>sows</b> in stalls (system A) and two group-housing systems: system B with 62 <b>dry</b> <b>sows</b> and feeding stalls and system C with 65 <b>dry</b> <b>sows</b> and electronic sow feeders (ESFs). In systems A and 13, the sows were fed simultaneously twice daily. In system C, the sows were fed sequentially once a day. During feeding schedule 1, feeding times in systems A and B were 7 : 30 and 15 : 30 h, in system C feed was available from 15 : 30 h on. During schedule 2, feeding times in systems A and B were 7 : 30 and 21 : 30 h, in system C food was available from 7 : 30 h on. Ammonia emission, indoor temperature and animal activity were measured and the data were analysed considering autocorrelations with a time-series model. The values for the coefficients of determinations R- 2 of the models explaining ammonia emission by indoor temperature and animal activity were 48 % for system A, 66 % for system B and 64 % for system C. In all three systems, the diurnal patterns of the indoor temperature, animal activity and ammonia emission changed considerably with the feeding schedule. Average ammonia emissions per sow for feeding schedules 1 and 2 were, respectively, 0. 71 and 0. 68 g h(- 1) (probability P = 0. 23) from system A, 0. 60 and 0. 61 g h(- 1) (P = 0. 75) from system B and 0. 69 and 0. 76 g h(- 1) (P < 0. 01) from system C. It can be concluded that changing the feeding schedule alters the diurnal pattern of the ammonia emission, but if the animals are fed simultaneously, changing the feeding time {{does not affect the}} total amount of ammonia emitted. However, with the animals fed sequentially, the ammonia emission falls by 10 % if the feeding starts in the afternoon instead of in the morning. (C) 2003 Silsoe Research Institute.

40|$|This paper reviews donkey use in {{the farming}} systems of {{northern}} Namibia and discusses {{the experiences of the}} Northern Namibian Rural Development Project. Donkeys are increasingly popular in northern Namibia due to the harsh conditions and the decrease in available pasture. They are particularly used by women who usually do not work with oxen. However, they remain under-utilised due to economic, social and technical constraints. Unlike in other regions of Namibia where donkeys are only used for transport, in the north central regions it is common to find donkeys plowing. Realising the potential for further use of donkeys, the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Rural Development initiated an animal draft power development programme. Animal-drawn cultivators for weeding were tested including the BS 41 from Zimbabwe and the lighter Western Hoe (Houe occidentale) from Senegal and the Ebra cultivator from France. The Western Hoe proved the most suitable for use with donkeys and women found it convenient. Other trials have focused on the use of animal power for <b>dry</b> <b>sowing,</b> animal training methods and better ways of feeding draft animals...|$|R

Salmonellae were isolated from pens in 30 of 59 farrow-to-finish farms sampled. Herds classified as low risk were as likely to be positive as high-risk herds. The prevalence of infection was 2. 3 % in lactating sows, 5. 1 % in <b>dry</b> <b>sows,</b> 4. 6 % in gilts, 5. 9 % in fatteners, 4. 8 % in second stage weaners and 8. 0 % in first stage weaners. Prevalence of infection in lactating sows was lower than in other groups sampled (P≥ 0. 005 and was less in second stage than in first stage weaners (P≥ 0. 005). The predominant serotypes isolated were Typhimurium and Derby. Results show that infection was revalent in all production stages. Classification of herds based on serological results of fatteners may not reflect the prevalence of infection in other production stages...|$|R

40|$|Strigolactones, plant-secreted {{underground}} signalling molecules, play {{an important}} role in agricultural ecosystems, because they mediate the interaction of crops with symbiotic AM fungi and parasitic weeds like Striga hermonthica. Cereal host plants secret these signalling molecules particularly under nutrient-deficient conditions and especially when phosphate (P) is limiting. The objective of the present study was to see the potential of P seed priming for S. hermonthica management in cereals in relation to strigolactone production. It has been demonstrated that P fertiliser application down-regulates the production of these signalling molecules in the rhizosphere, which results in lower S. hermonthica infection of cereals. The laboratory study showed maximum production of strigolactones from dry and water-soaked seeds, while seed soaking in P solution reduced their production. Similarly, maximum S. hermonthica infection was observed under control treatments with <b>dry</b> <b>sowing</b> or water soaking, while P seed soaking decreased S. hermonthica germination, emergence and dry biomass in all cereal crops. Our study shows that P seed priming resulted in lower exudation of strigolactones, which induced less S. hermonthica seeds germination and hence may lead to lower S. hermonthica infection. P-based seed priming could prove to be an effective and affordable strategy to reduce S. hermonthica infection in cereals. Further research for practical field application is neede...|$|R

Aerobic rice could be successfully raised with half the water required as against puddled-transplanted rice in summer and entirely on rainfall in wet season with good rainfall distribution. Water saving is to the tune of 45 to 55 per cent in summer season and even higher in kharif season as compared to continuous submerged crop. Aerobic cultivation also reduces cost of cultivation to a considerable amount. The results revealed that high percentage of the farmers adopted the recommended package of practices; meanwhile they expressed aerobic rice cultivation reduces cost of cultivation to a considerable amount and it is a water saving technology with high production and productivity. While farmers accepted aerobic rice cultivation with new variety MAS 946 - 1, their main concern was the weed control. Some of the important suggestions offered by the farmers to over come the constraints in direct seeded aerobic method of cultivation are also discussed. The results reveal that the farmers were convinced about aerobic rice cultivation and accepted the new rice variety developed...|$|R
40|$|Animal {{welfare is}} {{impaired}} if the diet {{does not provide}} sufficient feeling of satiety {{or the ability to}} perform natural feeding behavior. Pigs are omnivores and spend most of the day searching for food by rooting, grazing and chewing. Both inability to perform foraging behavior and insufficient feeling of satiety often leads to direction of foraging behavior towards stereotyped and abnormal oral behavior. <b>Dry</b> <b>sows</b> are often fed restrictively which leads to unsatisfied feeling of hunger. Dietary fiber has been found to reduce stereotypic and abnormal behavior as well as aggression, which could indicate that pigs need to forage has been met giving a feeling of satiety. The long term effect is mainly found in viscous, soluble dietary fibers while bulky dietary fibers mainly provide only a short term feeling of satiety. For slaughter pigs the argument to use dietary fiber is mainly to provide foraging substrate rather than to nourish, even though roughages in the ration {{have been shown to be}} beneficial for the welfare of slaughter pigs. More studies are needed about the relationship between behavior, satiety and the use of different dietary fibers and appropriate admix. The aim of this review was to examine the relationship between dietary fiber and welfare in terms of feelings of satiety and the ability to perform natural feeding behaviors...|$|R
40|$|Controlling {{potentially}} harmful and polluting emissions from farms {{is important in}} the developed world, where legislation exists in many countries limiting emissions such as ammonia and controlling how manure is disposed of from intensive farming operations. In Switzerland, there are legal agreements concerning controls of ammonia emissions, most especially from farms. Ammonia production from pig farms can be controlled by dietary intervention, such as reducing protein levels, which in turn reduces excretion, mainly via urine. The following paper surveys current practices for nitrogen use on Swiss pig farms, and how feeding strategies may assist in controlling ammonia production from pig production systems. The survey found that 70 - 75 % of all feeds used for pigs of all categories were reduced in protein and nitrogen, with 90 % being reduced in protein in high animal density areas. Regression analysis showed that CP levels explained up to 49 % of the nitrogen efficiency, suggesting that other factors are important in pollution control. Although piglet diets are more tightly regulated in terms of controlling N input, excessive protein levels in so-called reduced protein diets for finisher pigs and <b>dry</b> <b>sows</b> are common in the market. Hence, there is considerable potential to reduce N-input and ammonia emissions from Swiss pig production, which could be implemented at no or minimal extra cos...|$|R
40|$|Effect of 10 {{pre-soaking}} seed treatments on cotton germination, seedling {{length and}} weight at salinity levels of 1. 5, 5, 10, 15, 22 and 30 dS m 1 was studied under laboratory conditions. Significantly higher germination, seedling length and seedling weight of cotton {{was found at}} S 1. 5 and S 5 salinity levels. Significant reduction in seed germination, seedling length and seedling weight of cotton was observed with linear increase in salinity. Minimum seedling length and weight was found at 30 ds m 1. The decrease in germination and seedling weight at 10, 15, 22 and 30 ds m 1 was 11, 22, 44 and 84 and was 6, 19, 34 and 44 % respectively. Like salinity, pre-soaking had a significant positive effect on germination, seedling length and weight. Soaking of seeds in 15 ml concentrated sulphuric acid for 10 minutes and then dipped in 15 meq/L calcium sulphate for 2 hours (T 9) was best of all treatments followed by T 4 (seed soaked in 20 ml concentrated sulphuric acid for 10 minutes) and T 8 (seeds soaked in 15 meq/L calcium sulphate for 2 hours) indicating that various soaking treatments helped in mitigating the hazardous effects of salinity.

40|$|AquaCrop, the FAO water {{productivity}} model, {{is used as}} a tool to predict crop production under water limiting conditions. In the first step AquaCrop was calibrated and validated for barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Data sets of field experiments at seven different locations in four countries (Ethiopia, Italy, Syria and Montana, USA) with different climates in different years and with five different cultivars were used for model calibration and validation. The goodness-of-fit between observed and simulated soil water content, green canopy cover, biomass and grain yield was assessed by means of the coefficient of determination (R 2), the Nasha-Sutcliff efficiency (E), the index of agreement (d) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The statistical parameters indicated an adequate accuracy of simulations (validation regression of yield: R 2 = 0. 95, E = 0. 94, d = 0. 99, RMSE = 0. 34). Subsequently, sowing strategies in the semi-arid environment of northern Ethiopia were evaluated with the validated model. <b>Dry</b> <b>sowing</b> had a probability of 47 % germination failure attributable to false start of the rainy season. On the other hand, delay sowing {{at the start of the}} rainy season to eliminate germinating weeds should be kept as short as possible because grain yields strongly reduce in the season due to water stress when sowing is delayed on shallow soils. This research demonstrates the ability of AquaCrop to predict accurately crop performance with only a limited set of input variables, and the robustness of the model under various environmental and climatic conditions. © 2012 Cambridge University Press.

40|$|Group housing of <b>dry</b> <b>sows</b> is {{compulsory}} in Europe from 2013 onwards. Many pig {{farmers who}} {{still have to}} convert to group housing fear the resulting demand {{on their ability to}} interact with individual animals. An example of such interaction is the training of gilts to use economically attractive but complicated feeding systems such as electronic sow feeding stations (ESF). Electronic Sow Feeding is a more complex husbandry system, which requires training from both animal and human. Pig farmers use a wide variety of training methods, ranging from a total free situation where the animals have the possibility to learn the feeding station without human interaction to systems in which the animal is confronted with thorough human interventions. The first method incorporates the risk that some animals do not consume any feed in several days. The second method is more time consuming and sometimes stressful for the animals. If a calm and relaxed training method proves to be an efficient way to train animals, this could also be used in other on farm situations. Wechsler and Lea (2007) concluded that {{there is a lack of}} studies focusing on the initial phase after the introduction of farm animals into a new housing system and a lack of studies on the way they learn to use new housing equipment. An assessment of training systems on Danish pig farms (Hansen and Vinther, 2004) has resulted in the advice not to interact too soon and let the animals discover the skills themselves. The way the animals experience the human intervention can be assessed by measuring heart rate variability (HRV) (Von Borell et al., 2007). They state that “HRV is a promising approach for evaluating stress and emotional states in animals”. The results of this project can be used in the knowledge transfer about human animal relationships within the Welfare Quality programme...|$|R
