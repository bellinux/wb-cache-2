25|$|Pitfall traps {{are derived}} from rolled leaves, which evolved several {{independent}} times through convergent evolution. The vascular tissues of Sarracenia <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point.</b> The keel along {{the front of the}} trap contains a mixture of leftward- and rightward-facing vascular bundles, as would be predicted from the fusion of the edges of an adaxial (stem-facing) leaf surface. Flypapers also show a simple evolutionary gradient from sticky, non-carnivorous leaves, through passive flypapers to active forms. Molecular data show the Dionaea–Aldrovanda clade is closely related to Drosera, and evolved from active flypaper traps into snap traps.|$|E
500|$|There {{has also}} been {{the fact that the}} {{composer}} did not follow sonata form strictly, relying instead on juxtaposing blocks of tonalities and thematic groups. Maes states this point has been seen at times as a weakness rather than a sign of originality. Even with what Schonberg termed [...] "a professional reevaluaton" [...] of Tchaikovsky's work, the practice of faulting Tchaikovsky for not following in the steps of the Viennese masters has not gone away entirely, while his intent of writing music that would please his audiences is also sometimes taken to task. In a 1992 article, New York Times critic Allan Kozinn writes, [...] "It is Tchaikovsky's flexibility, after all, that has given us a sense of his variability.... Tchaikovsky was capable of turning out music—entertaining and widely beloved though it is—that seems superficial, manipulative and trivial when regarded {{in the context of the}} whole literature. The First Piano Concerto <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point.</b> It makes a joyful noise, it swims in pretty tunes and its dramatic rhetoric allows (or even requires) a soloist to make a grand, swashbuckling impression. But it is entirely hollow." ...|$|E
500|$|The various {{alternatives}} to Darwinian evolution {{by natural selection}} were not necessarily mutually exclusive. The evolutionary philosophy of the American palaeontologist Edward Drinker Cope <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point.</b> Cope, a religious man, began his career denying the possibility of evolution. In the 1860s, he accepted that evolution could occur, but, influenced by Agassiz, rejected natural selection. Cope accepted instead the theory of recapitulation of evolutionary history during {{the growth of the}} embryo - that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, which Agassiz believed showed a divine plan leading straight up to man, in a pattern revealed both in embryology and palaeontology. Cope did not go so far, seeing that evolution created a branching tree of forms, as Darwin had suggested. Each evolutionary step was however non-random: the direction was determined in advance and had a regular pattern (orthogenesis), and steps were not adaptive but part of a divine plan (theistic evolution). This left unanswered the question of why each step should occur, and Cope switched his theory to accommodate functional adaptation for each change. Still rejecting natural selection as the cause of adaptation, Cope turned to Lamarckism to provide the force guiding evolution. Finally, Cope supposed that Lamarckian use and disuse operated by causing a vitalist growth-force substance, [...] "bathmism", to be concentrated in the areas of the body being most intensively used; in turn, it made these areas develop {{at the expense of the}} rest. Cope's complex set of beliefs thus assembled five evolutionary philosophies: recapitulationism, orthogenesis, theistic evolution, Lamarckism, and vitalism. Other palaeontologists and field naturalists continued to hold beliefs combining orthogenesis and Lamarckism until the modern synthesis in the 1930s.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{technologies}} and materials {{associated with the}} creation of a nuclear power program have a dual-use capability, in that they {{can be used to make}} nuclear weapons if a country chooses to do so.

2500|$|However, the phonetic {{component}} {{is not always}} as meaningless as this example would suggest. Rebuses were sometimes chosen that were compatible semantically as well as phonetically. It was also often {{the case that the}} determinative merely constrained the meaning of a word which already had several. 菜 cài [...] "vegetable" [...] <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point.</b> The determinative 艹 for plants was combined with 采 cǎi [...] "harvest". However, 采 cǎi does not merely provide the pronunciation. In classical texts it was also used to mean [...] "vegetable". That is, 采 underwent semantic extension from [...] "harvest" [...] to [...] "vegetable", and the addition of 艹 merely specified that the latter meaning was to be understood.|$|E
2500|$|Iranian {{historians have}} sought to defend their forebears by using Arab sources to {{illustrate}} that [...] "contrary to the claims of some historians, Iranians, in fact, fought long and hard against the invading Arabs." [...] By 651, most of the urban centers in Iranian lands, with the notable exception of the Caspian provinces and Transoxiana, had come under the domination of the Arab armies. Many localities in Iran staged a defense against the invaders, {{but in the end}} none was able to repulse the invasion. Even after the Arabs had subdued the country, many cities rose in rebellion, killing the Arab governor or attacking their garrisons, but reinforcements from the caliphs succeeded in putting down all these rebellions and imposing the rule of Islam. The violent subjugation of Bukhara after many uprisings <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point.</b> Conversion to Islam was, however, only gradual. In the process, many acts of violence took place, Zoroastrian scriptures were burnt and many mobads executed. Once conquered politically, the Persians began to reassert themselves by maintaining Persian language and culture. Regardless, Islam was adopted by many, for political, socio-cultural or spiritual reasons, or simply by persuasion, and became the dominant religion.|$|E

60|$|I have ventured by {{this time}} to speak of Ruim as Thanet; and indeed that was already one of the names by which the island was known to its own inhabitants.

The name is every day {{as old as the}} Roman occupation. Solinus, writing in the third century, calls it Thanaton, and in the torn British fragment of the Peutinger Tables--that curious old map of the later empire--it is marked as Tenet. Indeed, {{it is a matter of}} demonstration that every spot which had a known name in Roman Britain retained that name after the English conquest. Kent itself <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point,</b> and every one of its towns bears out the law, from Dover and Lymne to Reculver and Richborough, which last is spelt 'Ratesburg' by Leland, Henry the Eighth's commissioner.|$|E
60|$|I {{say this}} not in {{depreciation}} of Mr. Mill's book. I mean {{it for the}} very highest praise. M. Agassiz says somewhere that every great scientific truth must go through three stages of public opinion. Men will say of it, first, {{that it is not}} true; next, that it is contrary to religion; and lastly, that every one knew it already. The last assertion of the three is often more than half true. In many cases every one ought to have known the truth already, if they had but used their common sense. The great antiquity of the earth <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point.</b> Forty years ago it was still untrue; five-and-twenty years ago it was still contrary to religion. Now every child who uses his common sense can see, from looking at the rocks and stones about him, that the earth is many thousand, it may be many hundreds of thousands of years old; and there is no difficulty now in making him convince himself, by his own eyes and his own reason, of the most prodigious facts of the glacial epoch.|$|E
