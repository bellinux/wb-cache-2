5|$|After the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup, John Herdman {{was hired}} as {{head coach of the}} Canadian {{national}} team. He rebuilt the team and used inclusive language to help create an environment that allowed players to be honest with each other and grow. McLeod was able to address issues that she had with herself and others, which she attributed to helping re-build <b>her</b> <b>confidence.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gopalam and {{his wife}} Ammi, jovial by nature, treat the couple like their own children. Although Mary finds the Hindu customs strange, she says nothing to Gopalam and Ammi because she needs her job to repay David. She vents her {{frustration}} to Rao and Devaiah, who bear it patiently. Although Sita wanted Mary to teach her music, Mary's short temper diminishes <b>her</b> <b>confidence</b> and Rao takes over her music lessons.|$|E
5|$|McLeod fully transitioned to the Canadian senior {{national}} team following her {{performance at the}} U-19 World Championship. She has stated that the transition was difficult for her due to the great depth of goalkeepers already with the {{national team}}, noting she often took the back seat to more experienced players, which affected <b>her</b> <b>confidence.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{poured out}} <b>her</b> <b>confidences</b> in swift, almost furious protest. She had never confided {{to him so}} much before.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{never mind}} me," [...] said Constance, {{freezing}} {{up into her}} reserve again as if she regretted <b>her</b> <b>confidences.</b> [...] "I'll get along all right. This {{is one of my}} off days, when everything looks black." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing--except that I {{find it very}} amusing {{with its}} reminiscences of the company she used to entertain, and <b>her</b> <b>confidences</b> generally. Good-by--take care of the lion in the hall. He always couches on the left for a spring. Ta-ta!" ...|$|R
5|$|On {{the day of}} the show, Rachel (Lea Michele) is accosted by Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff), {{her former}} boyfriend and current {{director}} of rival show choir Vocal Adrenaline. Jesse tries to hurt <b>her</b> <b>confidence</b> by bringing up her failed NYADA audition before Carmen Tibideaux (Whoopi Goldberg), but she realizes his intent and that his own uncertainty is showing.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Chastain {{made her}} {{professional}} stage debut as Juliet in {{a production of}} Romeo and Juliet staged by TheatreWorks, a company in the San Francisco Bay Area. The production led her to audition for the Juilliard School in New York City, where she was soon accepted and granted a scholarship funded by the actor Robin Williams. In her first year at the school, Chastain suffered from anxiety and was worried about being dropped from the program, spending {{most of her time}} reading and watching movies. She later remarked that her participation in a successful production of The Seagull during her second year helped build <b>her</b> <b>confidence.</b> She graduated from the school with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 2003.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, casting began for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (released as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in the United States), {{the film}} {{adaptation}} of British author J. K. Rowling's best-selling novel. Casting agents found Watson through her Oxford theatre teacher, and producers {{were impressed by}} <b>her</b> <b>confidence.</b> After eight auditions, producer David Heyman told Watson and fellow applicants Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint {{that they had been}} cast for the roles of the school friends Hermione Granger, Harry Potter and Ron Weasley, respectively. Rowling supported Watson from her first screen test.|$|E
60|$|Somehow, I was {{not quite}} as elated as I might have been. I remembered that Cynthia had begun <b>her</b> <b>confidences</b> {{in much the same}} way. Besides, a father confessor should be elderly, {{it is not at all}} the role for a young man.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{brought my}} old doll, but I keep her hidden because I am {{too big to}} play with her, and yet I can't bear to throw her away, I'm so fond of her," [...] said Rose, {{continuing}} <b>her</b> <b>confidences</b> in a whisper.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd {{rather be}} an old man's {{housekeeper}} than his wife; but people won't believe it, and laugh at me for being what they call so foolish," [...] said the girl, petulantly; for she {{did not seem to}} be getting on well with <b>her</b> <b>confidences.</b>|$|R
5|$|It {{has been}} said of Hannah de Rothschild that she {{grew up with a}} good sense and {{presence}} of mind, enabling her to deputise for her mother on grand social occasions at Mentmore and in London. This gave <b>her</b> <b>confidence</b> and the experience to be the perfect political wife. Marriage to her altered Rosebery's status, too: while his wife acquired Christian respectability and a title, Rosebery moved from being one of many wealthy and capable young noblemen to being one with unfathomable riches. This, coupled with his good looks, appealed to the public's imagination and gave him glamour.|$|E
5|$|Stefani portrays several {{characters}} from the books, including Alice, the White Queen, and the Red Queen, in dresses by British-Gibraltarian fashion designer John Galliano. The video frequently cuts to Stefani {{back in the}} studio to show her singing and performing in semi-synchronization with her actions within her fantasy world. As this transpires the song is recording itself. Stefani ultimately rediscovers <b>her</b> <b>confidence,</b> and her full awareness is transported back to the ordinary reality of the studio just as she dances {{in front of her}} four giggling Harajuku Girls. She then is presented with her bill by the consultant as a wooden chair topples to the floor.|$|E
5|$|The Frank sisters each {{hoped to}} return to school {{as soon as they were}} able, and {{continued}} with their studies while in hiding. Margot took a shorthand course by correspondence in Bep Voskuijl's name and received high marks. Most of Anne's time was spent reading and studying, and she regularly wrote and edited her diary entries. In addition to providing a narrative of events as they occurred, she wrote about her feelings, beliefs, and ambitions, subjects she felt she could not discuss with anyone. As <b>her</b> <b>confidence</b> in her writing grew, and as she began to mature, she wrote of more abstract subjects such as her belief in God, and how she defined human nature.|$|E
6000|$|I had seldom seen Marlow so vehement, so pessimistic, so earnestly cynical before. I cut his declamation {{short by}} asking what answer Flora de Barral {{had given to}} his question. [...] "Did the poor girl admit firing off <b>her</b> <b>confidences</b> at Mrs Fyne--eight pages of close writing--that sort of thing?" ...|$|R
60|$|As the seaman {{looked down}} at the pitiful old soul that had thus broken the {{floodgates}} of a long silence, and was pouring out <b>her</b> <b>confidences</b> to him, he felt an unusual lump in his throat. Under a sudden impulse, he stooped and kissed the wrinkled brow, and then, turning abruptly, left the hut.|$|R
60|$|The old lady, {{in great}} delight at meeting a compatriot, poured out <b>her</b> <b>confidences</b> to Dame Lilias of Glenuskie. Infinitely grieved and annoyed was she when, early {{as were the}} {{ordinary}} hours of the Court of Nanci, it proved that the Dauphiness had called up her sisters an hour before, and taken them across the chace which surrounded the castle to hear mass at a convent of Benedictine nuns.|$|R
5|$|Zoe Tapper as Dr. Anya Raczynski. Anya was {{a doctor}} in a busy city {{hospital}} when the virus struck and watched hundreds of patients die of the virus, including her friend and lover Patricia Kelly, and Patricia's flatmate Jenny Walsh. After treating a badly wounded Tom on the road, she joins the group. She privately discloses that, {{in the face of}} the pandemic, her faith in practicing medicine was deeply shaken, and she had initially sought to kill herself. Only later does she regain <b>her</b> <b>confidence</b> to successfully deliver a breech birth infant.|$|E
5|$|David's {{private life}} was less felicitous. In April 1963 her affair with Higgins {{came to an}} end when he remarried. For a period she drank too much brandy and resorted too often to {{sleeping}} pills. Probably {{as a result of these}} factors and overwork, in 1963, when she was 49, David suffered a cerebral haemorrhage. She kept the news of the event within her close circle of friends—none of the editors of the publications she worked for were aware of the collapse—as she did not want her reputation as a hard worker to be damaged. She recovered, but <b>her</b> <b>confidence</b> was badly shaken and her sense of taste was temporarily affected; for a period she could not taste salt, or the effect salt had on what she was cooking, but her sense of smell of frying onions was so enhanced as to be unpleasant for her.|$|E
5|$|Flood was They Might Be Giants' first {{release on}} any major label. Elektra Records {{approached}} the band following the unexpected {{success of their}} second album, Lincoln, which was released on the independent Bar/None label. The record deal that Elektra presented was {{largely due to the}} work of Susan Drew, an A worker who had been following the band since 1986. Because of <b>her</b> <b>confidence,</b> the band was given an extensive level of creative control over their projects, in addition to the ability {{to take advantage of the}} label's strategies and resources. Although They Might Be Giants recorded the album as a duo, they were joined by many guest musicians on brass and string instruments. The band also enlisted Alan Bezozi to help program some of the drums for the album.|$|E
6000|$|... 'In her {{intellectual}} character it is {{pleasing to}} observe an insatiable thirst for knowledge, {{and a quick}} perception of the relations of things. In her moral character, it is beautiful to behold her continual gladness, her keen enjoyment of existence, her expansive love, <b>her</b> unhesitating <b>confidence,</b> <b>her</b> sympathy with suffering, her conscientiousness, truthfulness, and hopefulness.' ...|$|R
60|$|Helen {{looked over}} her {{shoulder}} to catch a view of Chitterlow's retreating aspect. It did not compel <b>her</b> complete <b>confidence.</b>|$|R
50|$|Raymond {{spent the}} next six years advising her and hearing <b>her</b> <b>confidences.</b> While there, Raymond {{gradually}} learned to trust her holiness and her judgment. This was sealed when he became involved in nursing victims of a plague in 1374. When he contracted the disease himself and lay near death, Catherine came and sat at his bedside until he recovered. Knowing how close he was to death, Raymond credited his recovery to her prayers.|$|R
5|$|Ravana fights {{the final}} duel with Rama. Rama fails to kill Ravana with his {{ordinary}} arrows, but finally kills with a magical arrow. While Valmiki's Ramayana narrates that the magical arrow {{was given to}} Rama by Indra, in other versions the magical arrow is hidden in Mandodari's bed chambers or under her bed. While Mandodari is engrossed in worshipping the goddess Parvati for Ravana's wellbeing, Hanuman comes to her disguised as a Brahmin. After winning <b>her</b> <b>confidence,</b> he tricks her into revealing the secret location of the arrow. Hanuman seizes the arrow and gives it to Rama, leading to Ravana's end. Mandodari appears at the death scene of Ravana in a disarrayed state and laments his death. In this battle, Mandodari loses her husband, her sons, and her kinsmen.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months later}} in Tokyo, Saya saves {{a girl named}} Mana Hiiragi from a berserk {{humanoid}} Elder Bairn. Mana and Saya are rescued by Mana's comrades in SIRRUT, a covert group resisting Fumito's group who heard about Saya's past through Itsuki Tomofusa, a spy who died following the experiment. The group is led by Fumito's relative Kuroto Mogari, whose family was killed so Fumito could have control over the Shrovetide. Kuroto offers Saya SIRRUT's aid finding Fumito in exchange for her help. Hunted by Tower, and after saving Mana from Youth Ordinance Bill enforcers, Saya agrees to help. Saya and Mana infiltrate a private academy funded by Fumito when {{he is scheduled to}} give a lecture. When Saya attacks, it is revealed to be a trap baited with a false version of Fumito, and she must fight off an Elder Bairn before they can escape. In the aftermath, Mana reveals that her father disappeared after she helped him with his research into Tower. Regaining <b>her</b> <b>confidence</b> as a hacker, Mana locates Tower's main base, allowing Saya to infiltrate the base.|$|E
5|$|Suzy gets {{a job at}} {{a burger}} joint, and moves into an {{abandoned}} boiler, with entry through the attached pipe. Doc is unhappy, and Hazel decides {{something has to be done}} ("Thinkin' "). He is unable to come up with an answer, and eventually forgets the question. Some weeks pass, and Joe the Mexican woos Suzy. He has no success, and his attempts irritate Doc. The next day, Doc himself approaches the pipe with flowers in hand ("How Long?"), still uncertain as to why he is seeking a girl like Suzy. Suzy lets him in the boiler, which she has fitted up in a homelike manner. She is doing well at the burger joint, but is grateful to Fauna for giving <b>her</b> <b>confidence.</b> She is confident enough, indeed, to reject Doc, who is unhappy, but philosophical ("The Next Time It Happens").|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, of course," [...] {{said the}} poor girl, {{blushing}} crimson {{at the thought}} of having been led almost to betray <b>her</b> friend's <b>confidences.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{moved away}} and Leonard watched her with {{thoughtful}} eyes. He believed he enjoyed <b>her</b> sisters' <b>confidence,</b> {{but he was}} doubtful of Hilda.|$|R
60|$|It was {{incredible}} {{to her that}} any sane girl would reject such an alliance, but I was very far from <b>her</b> proud <b>confidence.</b>|$|R
5|$|Neuner's {{shooting}} performances {{have been}} a regular topic in the German media. At times she {{has been reluctant to}} discuss her shooting in interviews and has said the public's fixation on it contributes to the problem. She has insisted her difficulties in the standing position are not due to technical weaknesses but psychological, and her training results are just as good as the results of her team mates. She explained in interviews that she had developed a fear of the standing shooting over time, knowing she had to justify herself after the race if she missed. In 2008, Neuner trained with Bundeswehr shooting coach and former large calibre world champion, Rudi Krenn, and subsequently changed her stance slightly. Since 2009, she has worked with a psychologist, primarily focusing on mental techniques to build <b>her</b> <b>confidence</b> on the shooting range. Her standing position average has improved from 60% to 75% from 2008 to 2011. Neuner has been wearing ear plugs during some of the races in order to better concentrate while shooting. The individual race, which places a high emphasis on shooting, has traditionally been her worst discipline (each shooting error results in a one-minute time penalty, instead of a penalty loop).|$|E
25|$|Coldly, dispassionately she viewed him, {{the chill}} steel {{of the gun}} giving <b>her</b> <b>confidence.</b> She must not miss now—she would not miss—and she did not.|$|E
25|$|The Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) have {{expressed}} skepticism over Luistro's stand on sex education citing his religious background. Meanwhile, Luistro's predecessor, Mona Valisno expressed <b>her</b> <b>confidence</b> with Luistro.|$|E
5000|$|Aria was valedictorian in high school, and she credits this {{as one of}} {{the things}} that gave <b>her</b> the <b>confidence</b> to [...] "change the world a little bit".|$|R
60|$|Stella divined {{something}} {{of what was}} passing in his mind; not all, indeed, for to her the full measure of his folly would have been incomprehensible. For a moment she contemplated an explanation, then abandoned the idea because she could find no words; because, also, this was another person's secret, {{and she had no}} right to involve an honest man, who had paid her a great compliment, in <b>her</b> <b>confidences.</b> So she said nothing. To Morris, for the moment at any rate, a conclusive proof of his worst suspicions.|$|R
50|$|After her live {{performance}} of the song with Simon in July 2013, Taylor Swift stated that Simon had revealed {{the identity of the}} song's subject to <b>her</b> in <b>confidence.</b>|$|R
