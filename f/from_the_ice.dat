5|$|Common storylines revolve around: Finn and Jake {{discovering}} strange creatures, rescuing princesses <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ice</b> King, and battling monsters {{in order}} to help others. Various other episodes deal with Finn attempting to understand his attraction towards Bubblegum.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, a well-preserved carcass {{was found}} on Maly Lyakhovsky Island, one of the islands in the New Siberian Islands archipelago, a female between 50 and 60 {{years old at the}} time of death. The carcass {{contained}} well-preserved muscular tissue. When it was extracted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> liquid blood spilled from the abdominal cavity. The finders interpreted this as indicating woolly mammoth blood possessed anti-freezing properties.|$|E

5|$|Experiments and ice {{modeling}} {{published in}} 2016, indicate that tidal flexing dissipation can generate one {{order of magnitude}} more heat in Europa's ice than scientists had previously assumed. Their results indicates {{that most of the}} heat generated by <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> actually comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice's</b> crystalline structure (lattice) as a result of deformation, and not friction between <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> grains. <b>The</b> greater the deformation of <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> sheet, <b>the</b> more heat is generated.|$|R
5|$|The {{pressure}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> caused Endurance {{to start}} to take on water. To prevent the ship from flooding McNish built a cofferdam, caulking it with strips of blankets and nailing strips over the seams, standing for hours up to his waist in freezing water as he worked. He could not prevent the pressure <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> crushing the ship though and was experienced enough {{to know when to}} stop trying. Once the ship had been destroyed he was put in charge of rescuing the stores from what had been The Ritz. With McNish in charge it took only a couple of hours to open the deck far enough to retrieve a good quantity of provisions.|$|E
5|$|During the {{southern}} party's absence the relief ship Morning arrived, bringing fresh supplies. The expedition's organisers {{had assumed that}} the Discovery would be free <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> in early 1903, enabling Scott to carry out further seaborne exploration and survey work before winter set in. It was intended that Discovery would return to New Zealand in March or April, then home to England via the Pacific, continuing its magnetic survey en route. Morning would provide any assistance that Scott might require during this period.|$|E
5|$|One tourism {{activity}} {{unique to the}} Arctic North is iceberg watching. During the summer season of April to July, {{it is possible to}} watch icebergs moving down rivers while the ice around them melts. In addition, watching the floe edge is also a popular activity due to wildlife movement during this time. Whales can often be seen swimming metres <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> polar bears can be observed swimming briefly in the icy water and amphibious animals often bring themselves up onto dry land or onto the ice to sunbathe.|$|E

5|$|The babies {{discover}} a tiny lizard in Tommy Pickles' backyard {{that they are}} convinced is the offspring of Reptar, a fictitious green dinosaur and main character of many action movies of which the Rugrats are fond. After learning about the extinction of the dinosaurs, Tommy decides to return the lizard to Reptar just as his family has purchased tickets for a musical ice show based on the character. After Tommy's parents and grandfather have fallen asleep, the babies sneak into the ice rink and present the lizard to Leo, the actor portraying Reptar, who coincidentally happens to possess a phobia of lizards. Stu Pickles, Tommy's father, sees the rugrats and must retrieve them <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> rink.|$|E
5|$|The {{brown bear}} and both species of black bears {{sometimes}} take large ungulates, such as deer and bovids, mostly {{the young and}} weak. These animals may be taken by a short rush and ambush, though hiding young may be stiffed out and pounced on. The polar bear mainly preys on seals, stalking them <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> or breaking into their dens. They primarily eat the highly digestible blubber. Large mammalian prey is typically killed by a bite to the head or neck, or (in the case of young) simply pinned down and mauled. Predatory behaviour in bears is typically taught to the young by the mother.|$|E
5|$|When the {{two sides}} met in late-February, {{a week before the}} brawl game, during the third period, Flyers winger Mark Recchi was {{following}} Martin Havlat of the Senators when he crossed into the Philadelphia defensive zone. As this happened, Recchi hooked Havlat, causing both of the players to collide and fall into the boards. When Havlat got up <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> angered by Recchi's hook, he took his stick above him and slashed Recchi, hitting him in the face.|$|E

5|$|Also in 1928, she {{assisted}} in the search effort for the wrecked airship Italia, which had crashed on the polar ice northeast of Svalbard. In addition, Roald Amundsen, who had also joined the search effort, went missing himself. Strassbourg arrived in Tromsø, Norway, on 19 June, to search for both Italia and Amundsen's aircraft. The ship's bow was not designed to operate in an Arctic environment, and so the crew had to continually fix wood planks to the hull to protect it <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice.</b> While refueling from the tanker Durance, Strassbourg took on two FBA 17 seaplanes {{to assist in the}} search effort. On 30 August, Strassbourg located one of the floats from Amundsen's aircraft, confirming the loss of the plane. The search effort was called off on 17 September, and Strassbourg returned to Brest by way of Reykjavík, arriving back in France by mid October.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{expedition}} it took the combined efforts of two relief ships and the use of explosives to free Discovery <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice.</b> His insistence during {{the expedition}} on Royal Navy formalities had made for uneasy relations with the merchant navy contingent, many of whom departed for home with the first relief ship in March 1903. Second-in-command Albert Armitage, a merchant officer, was offered the chance to go home on compassionate grounds, but chose to interpret the offer as a personal slight, and refused. Armitage also promoted the idea that the decision to send Shackleton home on the relief ship arose from Scott's animosity rather than Shackleton's physical breakdown. Although there were later tensions between Scott and Shackleton, when their polar ambitions directly clashed, in public mutual civilities were preserved; Scott joined in the official receptions that greeted Shackleton on his return in 1909 after the Nimrod Expedition, and the two were exchanging polite letters about their respective ambitions in 1909–10.|$|E
5|$|Aurora's passage <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> towards safety proved {{slow and}} perilous. Coal {{supplies}} {{had to be}} conserved, allowing only limited use of the engines, and the improvised emergency rudder made steering difficult; the ship wallowed helplessly at times, in danger of foundering. Even after making {{contact with the outside}} world, Stenhouse was initially reluctant to seek direct assistance, fearful that a salvage claim might create further embarrassment for the expedition. However, he was obliged to request help when, as Aurora neared New Zealand in stormy weather on 31 March, it was in danger of being driven on the rocks. Two days later the tug Dunedin reached the ship and a towline was secured. On the following morning, 3 April 1916, Aurora was brought into the harbour at Port Chalmers.|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} of samples from a translucent green iceberg with a core <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Ronne <b>Ice</b> Shelf revealed an excellent agreement in isotopic composition, crystal structure, and incorporated sediment particles. Marine shelf <b>ice</b> which constitutes <b>the</b> basal portion of some ice shelves {{is considered to}} be the source of green icebergs. It most likely results from "ice pump" processes which produce large amounts of <b>ice</b> platelets in <b>the</b> water column beneath ice shelves. These subsequently accumulate and become compacted into bubble-free, desalinated ice. Iceberg and drift-buoy trajectories indicate that green icebergs observed in the Weddell Sea originate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Amery <b>Ice</b> Shelf rather than <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Ronne <b>Ice</b> Shelf, although <b>the</b> latter <b>ice</b> shelf is also a potential source...|$|R

5|$|Ballard {{went on to}} tally 34 {{points during}} his first {{campaign}} with Florida in 2008–09. The following season, on November 30, 2009, Ballard was involved in an on-ice incident that injured his own teammate, goaltender Tomáš Vokoun. After being on the ice for a goal during {{a game against the}} Atlanta Thrashers, Ballard aimed to smash his stick in frustration against the post and mistakenly hit Vokoun in the mask. Vokoun was taken <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> on a stretcher and suffered a cut on his ear that required stitches; he missed two games before returning to the lineup. Ballard, who apologized to Vokoun following the game, was not disciplined by the Panthers or NHL. He went on to match his career-high eight goals and added 20 assists for 28 points in his second season with the Panthers. He also ranked third in the league in blocked shots with 201. Ballard had played parts of the season with a hip injury. After completing the campaign, he underwent the second hip surgery of his career in May 2010 to repair a stress fracture and remove a cyst.|$|E
5|$|On 7 August Nansen and Johansen boarded Jackson's {{supply ship}} Windward, and sailed for Vardø where they {{arrived on the}} 13th. They were greeted by Hans Mohn, the {{originator}} of the polar drift theory, {{who was in the}} town by chance. The world was quickly informed by telegram of Nansen's safe return, but as yet there was no news of Fram. Taking the weekly mail steamer south, Nansen and Johansen reached Hammerfest on 18 August, where they learned that Fram had been sighted. She had emerged <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> north and west of Spitsbergen, as Nansen had predicted, and was now on her way to Tromsø. She had not passed over the pole, nor exceeded Nansen's northern mark. Without delay Nansen and Johansen sailed for Tromsø, where they were reunited with their comrades.|$|E
5|$|Sheldon then tells Rico {{to hurry}} to his hideout, where Rico learns that {{intelligence}} asset Jade Tan has been captured in Panay's military base {{and will be}} tortured and—possibly-summarily executed. Although Rico rescues her and destroys the base, Jade is bundled into a truck and a fleet of gunmen try to escape along a frozen lake. A nuclear submarine emerges <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> but Rico hijacks the truck and they are airlifted to safety by Kane (Sheldon and Rico's mission handler). Jade later explains that the Roaches, Reapers, and Ular Boys are secretly backed by Russia, China, and Japan, respectively, to bring down Baby Panay, but Rico and Sheldon wonder what the small island has which is so attractive to superpowers. They track down and assassinate the foreign intelligence officers liaising with the factions.|$|E

5|$|The Empire Arts Center, in {{downtown}} Grand Forks, {{is home to}} several cultural events throughout the year. The Empire, a 1919 movie theater, was restored after the Flood of 1997 and now includes performance space, a large movie screen, a gallery, and space for artists. The Fire Hall Theatre, also downtown, is used by community members to put on several theater productions each year. The Summer Performing Arts Company (SPA) is a popular summer arts program for area K-12 students. SPA stages three major musicals mid-July. The Myra Museum, on Belmont Road near the Greater Grand Forks Greenway, is a small history museum with exhibits that trace local history <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ice</b> Age, through settlement, and into the modern age. Other buildings on the Myra Museum grounds include the original 1868 Grand Forks Post Office, a 1917 one room school, and the historic Campbell House.|$|E
5|$|The {{large scale}} {{production}} {{of ice cream}} also resulted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> trade. Ice cream had been produced in small quantities {{since at least the}} 17th century, but this depended both on having large quantities of ice available, and substantial amounts of labour to manufacture it. This was because using ice to freeze ice cream relies both on the application of salt to an ice mixture to produce a cooling effect, and also on constantly agitating the mixture to produce the light texture associated with ice cream. By the 1820s and 1830s, the availability of ice in the cities of the U.S. east coast meant that ice cream was becoming increasingly popular, but still an essentially luxury product. In 1843, however, a new ice cream maker was patented by Nancy Johnson which required far less physical effort and time; similar designs were also produced in England and France. Combined with the growing ice trade, ice cream became much more widely available and consumed in greater quantities. In Britain, Norwegian ice was used by the growing Italian community in London from the 1850s onwards to popularise ice cream with the general public.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} unleashing of the king's power, Veigue's Force of Ice {{goes out of}} control, causing his friend Claire to become imprisoned in an ice pillar. One year after this, Veigue is {{contacted}} by Eugene and Mao, who help free Claire <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> pillar. Shortly after this, Claire is taken away by agents of Agarte, who is searching for the most beautiful Huma woman in the land. Veigue heads out with Eugene and Mao to rescue Claire, eventually joining forces with Annie, Tytree and Hilda. Upon reaching the royal capital of Balka, the group find Agarte using her Force of the Moon to resurrect Geyorkias {{in the belief that}} the spirit will save her kingdom from the chaos consuming it, having been prompted by Zilva. When summoned, Geyorkias declares his intent to destroy the Huma population, forcing the group to attack and destroy his physical form. With Geyorkias gone and Claire rescued, the group part ways, but are brought back together as outbreaks of racial violence from both Huma and Gajuma begin destabilizing Karegia, caused by the hatred the summoned Geyorkias released after his defeat. To quell the violence, the group decide to summon the other Sacred Beasts in the hope of purging Geyorkias' hatred from the land. After rescuing Agarte from a Huma mob, it is revealed that Agarte switched bodies with Claire. In the aftermath, Agarte reveals that she originally captured Claire so she could switch bodies and realize her love for her bodyguard Milhaust, as relations between Huma and Gajama are taboo. Unfortunately, the trauma of events has caused Agarte to lose her Force abilities, leaving Claire and Agarte trapped in each other's bodies.|$|E
