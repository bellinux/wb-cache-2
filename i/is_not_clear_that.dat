5|$|Alexander {{had planned}} to settle Greek colonists on Bahrain, and {{although}} it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> this happened on the scale he envisaged, Bahrain became very much part of the Hellenised world: {{the language of the}} upper classes was Greek (although Aramaic was in everyday use), while Zeus was worshipped {{in the form of the}} Arabian sun-god Shams. Bahrain even became the site of Greek athletic contests.|$|E
5|$|In Pakistan, the {{breeding}} {{range of the}} dusky crag martin overlaps that of the subspecies P. f. peloplasta of pale crag martin, but that species breeds much higher in the mountains. This altitudinal separation means {{that it is not}} known whether the two closely related martins could hybridise, which would cast doubts as to whether they were distinct species. Dusky crag martins from Burma and Thailand have been described as a separate darker subspecies, P. c. sintaungensis (originally Krimnochelidon concolor sintaungensis, Baker, 1832), but it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the difference is greater than that between individual martins of the nominate subspecies.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} what portion of the statute the Court upholds since it {{expressly}} refuses to decide whether the dues prohibition and fund administration provisions are valid. Section 93(b) does nothing more than impose those two restrictions on unions whose officials are disqualified under the criteria set forth in § 86. It does not, by its terms, provide a mechanism for disqualifying any union officer. Therefore, while it appears that the Court holds that a State is free to disqualify certain individuals from acting as union officials {{as long as it does}} not impose sanctions on the union itself, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> anything in § 93(b) enables the State to do that.|$|E

5|$|Harold's defeat was {{probably}} due to several circumstances. One was the need to defend against two almost simultaneous invasions. The fact that Harold had dismissed his forces in southern England on 8 September {{also contributed to the}} defeat. Many historians fault Harold for hurrying south and not gathering more forces before confronting William at Hastings, although it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the English forces were insufficient to deal with William's forces. Against these arguments for an exhausted English army, the length of the battle, which lasted an entire day, shows that the English forces were not tired by their long march. Tied in with the speed of Harold's advance to Hastings is the possibility Harold may not have trusted Earls Edwin of Mercia and Morcar of Northumbria once their enemy Tostig had been defeated, and declined to bring them and their forces south. Modern historians have pointed out that one reason for Harold's rush to battle was to contain William's depredations and keep him from breaking free of his beachhead.|$|E
5|$|Olfactory {{navigation}} {{has been}} suggested as a possible mechanism in pigeons. Papi's 'mosaic' model argues that pigeons build and remember a mental map of the odours in their area, recognizing where they are by the local odour. Wallraff's 'gradient' model argues {{that there is a}} steady, large-scale gradient of odour which remains stable for long periods. If there were two or more such gradients in different directions, pigeons could locate themselves in two dimensions by the intensities of the odours. However it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> such stable gradients exist. Papi did find evidence that anosmic pigeons (unable to detect odours) were much less able to orient and navigate than normal pigeons, so olfaction does seem to be important in pigeon navigation. However, {{it is not clear how}} olfactory cues are used.|$|E
5|$|The Sauvignon blanc grape traces {{its origins}} to western France in the Loire Valley and Bordeaux Regions. As noted above, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the vine {{originated}} in western France. Ongoing research suggests {{it may have}} descended from Savagnin. It has also {{been associated with the}} Carmenere family. At some point in the 18th century, the vine paired with Cabernet Franc to parent the Cabernet Sauvignon vine in Bordeaux. In the 19th century, plantings in Bordeaux were often interspersed with Sauvignon vert (In Chile, known as Sauvignonasse) as well as the Sauvignon blanc pink mutation Sauvignon gris. Prior to the phylloxera epidemic, the insect plague which devastated French vineyards in the 19th century, these interspersed cuttings were transported to Chile where the field blends are still common today. Despite the similarity in names, Sauvignon blanc has no known relation to the Sauvignon rosé mutation found in the Loire Valley of France.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} great {{interest}} in human evolution.

5|$|The {{period between}} the {{accession}} of Máel Coluim I and Máel Coluim mac Cináeda was marked by {{good relations with the}} Wessex rulers of England, intense internal dynastic disunity and, despite this, relatively successful expansionary policies. In 945, king Máel Coluim I received Strathclyde as part of a deal with King Edmund of England, an event offset somewhat by Máel Coluim's loss of control in Moray. Sometime in the reign of king Idulb (954–962), the Scots captured the fortress called oppidum Eden, i.e. Edinburgh. Scottish control of Lothian was strengthened with Máel Coluim II's victory over the Northumbrians at the Battle of Carham (1018). The Scots had probably some authority in Strathclyde since the later part of the ninth century, but the kingdom kept its own rulers, and it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the Scots were always strong enough to enforce their authority.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Knoetschesuchus is {{relatively}} short, with the snout taking up 47% of skull length in K. langenbergensis and 42% in K. guimarotae, which {{allows them to}} be classified as brevirostrine crocodilians. Along {{the side of the}} snout are two undulations, a smaller one on the premaxilla and a larger and broader one on the maxilla. The jagged suture between the premaxilla and maxilla is angled towards the front of the skull in K. langenbergensis and towards the back in K. guimarotae. Along the midline of the snout are the thin and wedge-like nasals; the nostrils, which face upwards, are clearly separated by the nasals in K. guimarotae, but it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> this is the case in K. langenbergensis.|$|E
5|$|Thucydides {{says that}} 200 Phoenician ships were {{captured}} and destroyed. It {{is highly unlikely}} that this occurred during the apparently brief naval battle, so these were probably grounded ships captured after the battle and destroyed with fire, as has been the case at Mycale. Plutarch says that 200 ships were captured, in addition to those that were destroyed or fled. It is possible that 'destroyed' in this context means sunk during the battle, since the Greeks would almost certainly have destroyed the ships that they captured as well (as Thucydides indeed implies). Since Thucydides only explicitly gives the number of ships destroyed, it is possible to reconcile Plutarch's and Thucydides's numbers, but it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> this is the best approach. There are no estimates in the ancient sources for casualties amongst the troops of either side.|$|E

5|$|While Mackay's account {{held that}} {{a wide array of}} society was {{involved}} in the tulip trade, Goldgar's study of archived contracts found that even at its peak the trade in tulips was conducted almost exclusively by merchants and skilled craftsmen who were wealthy, but not members of the nobility. Any economic fallout from the bubble was very limited. Goldgar, who identified many prominent buyers and sellers in the market, found fewer than half a dozen who experienced financial troubles in the time period, and even of these cases it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> tulips were to blame. This is not altogether surprising. Although prices had risen, money had not changed hands between buyers and sellers. Thus profits were never realized for sellers; unless sellers had made other purchases on credit in expectation of the profits, the collapse in prices did not cause anyone to lose money.|$|E
5|$|Ælfgar's Irish confederate of 1055 is not {{identified}} in any source, and it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Diarmait had a part {{to play in}} the aforesaid events of that year. In fact, it is possible that Ælfgar received aid not from Diarmait, but from DonnchadDiarmait's enemy and Echmarcach's associatea man who then controlled the Norse-Gaelic enclaves of Limerick and possibly Waterford. Furthermore, although Diarmait appears to have gained overlordship of Mann by 1061, Echmarcach presumably enjoyed overlordship of {{at least part of the}} Hebrides in 1058. Since Magnús utilised Islesmen during his English campaign of that year, it is conceivable that Echmarcach may have played a prominent part in these operations. If Echmarcach was indeed involved in the campaign, the enmity between him and Diarmait could indicate that these two were unlikely to have cooperated as allies.|$|E
5|$|The second {{considered}} {{application is}} animal agriculture. Cochrane argues that animals possess concrete rights {{not to be}} made to suffer or be killed while being raised for food. The book argues that factory farming inflicts suffering upon the animals used, and this suffering outweighs the cost to humans of not using the method. Killing animals for their flesh is also challenged, and objections that this infringes on human liberty, that many humans would lose their jobs and that flesh-consumption is necessary for human health are all considered and rejected. Milk and egg production may be permissible under certain circumstances, provided animals are not killed or made to suffer, and, equally, animal corpses could be used provided that the animals have died naturally. Three counter arguments are considered. First, Cochrane contends that the fact farmed animals would not exist {{were it not for the}} human desire for their flesh is irrelevant: it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> creating animals is good for them, and, even if it is, doing a good thing for an animal will not justify subsequently harming them, just as it would not in a human case. Second, Cochrane considers the fact that some animals are killed by nonhuman predators. He rejects Regan's claim that intervention is not required when killers are not moral agents and the consequentialist claim that interference will do more harm than good, instead suggesting that nonhuman predators need to kill to survive, but humans do not. Third, he considers the fact that animals are killed in the harvesting process. These animals, he suggests, are killed for human survival, but as fewer are killed than would be killed were humans eating meat, they do not possess a concrete right to life. Despite this, political communities must take steps to ensure that fewer animals are killed in harvest.|$|E
