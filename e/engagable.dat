25|$|The unified multi-functional 9M317 (export {{designation}} 9M317E) {{can be used}} {{to engage}} aerodynamic, ballistic, above-water and radio contrast targets from both land and sea. Examples of targets include tactical ballistic missiles, strategic cruise missiles, anti-ship missiles, tactical, strategic and army aircraft and helicopters. It was designed by OJSC Dolgoprudny Scientific Production Plant (DNPP). The maximum <b>engagable</b> target speed was 1200m/s and it can tolerate an acceleration overload of 24G. It was first used with Buk-M1-2 system of the land forces and the Shtil-1 system of the naval forces.|$|E

5000|$|Traditional {{solutions}} to the first mile problem in public transit have included the use of feeder buses, bicycling infrastructure, and urban planning reform. Other methods of alleviating {{the last mile problem}} such as bicycle sharing systems, car sharing programs, pod cars (personal rapid transit), and motorized shoes have been proposed with varying degrees of adoption. Late in 2015, the Ford Motor Company received a patent for a [...] "self-propelled unicycle <b>engagable</b> with vehicle", which is intended as a last mile commuter solution. Bicycle sharing programmes, however, have been widely successful in Europe and Asia, and are beginning to be implemented on a large scale in North America.|$|E
40|$|A {{mechanical}} connection system comprises a first body {{defining a}} receptable {{and a second}} body defining a pin matingly receivable in the receptacle by relative movement in a first directional mode. A primary latch is <b>engagable</b> between the two bodies to retain the pin in the receptacle. The primary latch is reciprocable in a second directional mode transverse to the first directional mode. A lock member carried {{by one of the}} bodies is operatively associated with the primary latch and movable, transverse to the second directional mode, between a locking position maintaining engagement of the primary latch and a releasing position permitting release of the primary latch. The lock includes an operator portion <b>engagable</b> to move the lock member from its locking position to its releasing position. The operator is located internally of the first body. An actuator is selectivity insertable into and disengagable from the first body. The actuator is movable relative to the first body when it is inserted for engagement with and operation of the operator...|$|E
40|$|A pile {{splice section}} for a spliced {{prestressed}} concrete pile includes a prestressed concrete element including a first end {{and a second}} end and a plurality of tendons that extend from the first end to the second end. A first end assembly at the first end of the prestressed concrete element includes a first plate coupled to the plurality of tendons. The first end assembly further includes a plurality of internally threaded fasteners embedded in the first end of the prestressed concrete element that are <b>engagable</b> via apertures extending through the first plate. A second end assembly at the second end of the prestressed concrete element includes a second metal plate coupled to the plurality of tendons. The second end assembly further includes a plurality of apertures extending through the second plate and accessible via pockets proximate the second end of the prestressed concrete element...|$|E
40|$|The sealing {{assembly}} for a port of a valve or {{the like}} is disclosed. In detail, the sealing assembly includes the port having a circular shaped end with a circular shaped knife-edge thereon. The sealing assembly further includes a hollow cap having a closed first end with an aperture therethrough and an open second end. The cap further includes internal threads adapted to mate with the external threads of the port. A gasket is mounted within the cap having flat first and second principle sides and made of a deformable metal, the first principle side of the gasket for mounting against the circular shaped knife edge of the port. A plunger having a circular shaped disc portion is adapted to fit within the hollow cap and is <b>engagable</b> with the first principle surface of the gasket and includes a shaft portion extending out of the aperture. The cap and shaft of the plunger include external wrenching flats. Thus when the cap is screwed onto the port and the plunger is prevented from rotating by a wrench mounted on the wrenching flats of the shaft portion of the plunger, the gasket is forced into engagement with the knife edge in pure compression and no rotation of the gasket occurs causing the knife edge to locally deform the gasket sealing of the port...|$|E
