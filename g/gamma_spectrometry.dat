50|$|Hot particles, {{radioactive}} {{particles of}} nuclear fallout and radioactive waste, also exhibit distinct isotopic signatures. Their radionuclide composition (and thus their age and origin) {{can be determined}} by mass spectrometry or by <b>gamma</b> <b>spectrometry.</b> For example, particles generated by a nuclear blast contain detectable amounts of 60Co and 152Eu. The Chernobyl accident did not release these particles but did release 125Sb and 144Ce. Particles from underwater bursts will consist mostly of irradiated sea salts. Ratios of 152Eu/155Eu, 154Eu/155Eu, and 238Pu/239Pu are also different for fusion and fission nuclear weapons, which allows identification of hot particles of unknown origin.|$|E

40|$|As {{a result}} of the UK’s {{industrial}} past, spoil heaps are widespread through our environment and encompass the waste products from a variety of different industrial processes. Two high-resolution airborne geophysical surveys, conducted over parts of the UK in 1998 and 1999, identified four radiometric anomalies in the East Shirebrook region corresponding to four areas of colliery spoil. These areas which are composed of shales, siltstones and sandstones extracted during mining mixed with left over coal displayed elevated potassium, uranium and thorium, relative to their surroundings. Ground follow-up work was undertaken at Shirebrook and Warsop Vale, the two disused collieries from the four radiometric anomalies identified by the airborne surveys in the East Shirebrook area. Active extraction ceased at these mines in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s and both have been undergoing reclamation and re-landscaping. The ground survey entailed ground-based continuous <b>gamma</b> <b>spectrometry</b> traverses over accessible parts of each site, ground-based static <b>gamma</b> <b>spectrometry</b> measurements over transects of the sites, surface soil sampling at these transect points for laboratory XRF analysis and short core sampling at Warsop Vale for <b>gamma</b> <b>spectrometry</b> analysis on a core logger. The ground survey confirmed, and more accurately delineated the anomalies observed by the airborne surveys. The ground-based continuous <b>gamma</b> <b>spectrometry</b> highlighted the marked difference between the radiometric signature of the spoil heaps and neighbouring agricultural land. A high degree of spatial variation was apparent in the ground-based <b>gamma</b> <b>spectrometry</b> data and highlighted that the spoil itself is not a uniform mass. Ground survey static <b>gamma</b> <b>spectrometry</b> results and XRF analysis of surface soil samples correlate significantly. Comparison of these surface soil samples (0 - 15 cm) obtained at both Shirebrook and Warsop Vale to regional Geochemical Baseline Survey of the Environment (G-BASE) surface soil samples obtained up to 1 km from the spoil tips showed that thorium was the element most elevated above background.

40|$|A {{combined}} Nuclear Materials Identification System (NMIS) -gamma ray spectrometry {{system can}} be used passively to obtain the following attributes of Pu: presence, fissile mass, 240 / 239 ratio, and metal vs. oxide. This system {{can also be used}} with a small, portable, DT neutron generator to measure the attributes of highly enriched uranium (HEU) : presence, fissile mass, enrichment, metal vs. oxide; and detect the presence of high explosives (HE). For the passive system, time-dependent coincidence distributions can be used for the presence, fissile mass, metal vs. oxide for Pu, and gamma-ray spectrometry can be used for 239 / 240 ratio and presence. So presence can be confirmed by two methods. For the active system with a DT neutron generator, all four attributes for both Pu and HEU can be determined from various features of the time-dependent coincidence distribution measurements for both Pu and HEU.

40|$|Disseminated {{deposits}} are low-grade, large tonnage deposits {{which are}} mainly mined for gold, copper, molybdenum and tin. These deposits are normally associated with intermediate to acid plutonic intrusive rocks {{and all are}} characterized by intense, extensive hydrothermal alteration of host rocks. Disseminated deposit exploration in the tropics suffers from difficult geological mapping due to dense vegetation, lack of rock outcrops and extensive but variable saprolytic weathering. Geophysical exploration of these deposits normally includes magnetic, induced polarization and <b>gamma</b> ray <b>spectrometry</b> surveys. The largest RTP total magnetic field anomaly highs are usually associated with diorite porphyry intrusive bodies. Diorites are usually less magnetic than basaltic rocks; thus when magnetic anomaly highs are related to intrusions they {{can be explained by}} basic metals’ intensive mineralization (including magnetite) associated with porphyry intrusions. Magnetic anomaly gradients regularly help delineate local discontinuities which can be interpreted as local faults and joints that can be mineralized. <b>Gamma</b> ray <b>spectrometry</b> is useful for determining anomalous potassium, uranium and thorium concentration as it can map alteration halos and linear discontinuities. Statistical analysis of the data also can determine the intermediate intrusive / extrusive nature of porphyry intrusions. <b>Gamma</b> ray <b>spectrometry</b> can help to determine elemental potassium concentration, regardless of the associated potassium mineral species, thereby enabling alteration mapping in a geological setting related to volcanic-associated massive sulphide base metal and gold deposits.

IGS and AGS systems were originally fundamental geophysical tools used in geological mapping of large areas, primarily in the search for enriched uranium deposits and often in combination with other geophysical instrumentation. IGS was often used as a tool for overcoming issues of sampling error when undertaking mapping or prospecting survey work. Influences of the vertical activity distribution generally have a greater impact on IGS measurements than AGS measurements because of the larger solid angle between the IGS detector and source, unless the detector is collimated. Nevertheless, solutions to providing independent means of measuring changes in the vertical activity distribution through IGS are becoming more commonly used...|$|E
