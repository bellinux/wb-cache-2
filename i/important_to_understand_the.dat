5|$|Due to its {{location}} at the South Pole, Antarctica receives relatively little solar radiation. This {{means that it}} is a very cold continent where water is mostly in the form of ice. Precipitation is low (most of Antarctica is a desert) and almost always in the form of snow, which accumulates and forms a giant ice sheet which covers the land. Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known as ice streams, which flow towards the edges of the continent. Next to the continental shore are many ice shelves. These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass. Offshore, temperatures are also low enough that ice is formed from seawater through most of the year. It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> various types of Antarctic ice to understand possible effects on sea levels and the implications of global cooling.|$|E

25|$|Algebraic {{geometry}} {{occupies a}} central place in modern mathematics and has multiple conceptual connections with such diverse fields as complex analysis, topology and number theory. Initially {{a study of}} systems of polynomial equations in several variables, the subject of algebraic geometry starts where equation solving leaves off, and it becomes even more <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> intrinsic properties of the totality of solutions {{of a system of}} equations, than to find a specific solution; this leads into some of the deepest areas in all of mathematics, both conceptually and in terms of technique.|$|E

25|$|Difficulties with standing, walking, turning corners, {{climbing}} stairs, and a slowing of gait {{are experienced}} as astronauts re-adapt to Earth's gravity, until terrestrial motor strategies are fully re-acquired. Adaptation to spaceflight also induces {{a significant increase}} in the time required to traverse an obstacle course on landing day, and recovery of functional mobility takes an average of two weeks. These difficulties can have adverse consequences for an astronauts’ ability to stand up or escape from the vehicle during emergencies and to function effectively immediately after leaving the spacecraft after flight. Thus it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> cause of these profound impairments of posture and locomotion stability, and develop countermeasures.|$|E
25|$|Firearm {{owners are}} subject to the firearm laws of the state they are in, and not {{exclusively}} their state of residence. Reciprocity between states exists in certain situations, such as with regard to concealed carry permits. These are recognized on a state-by-state basis. For example, Idaho recognizes an Oregon permit, but Oregon does not recognize an Idaho permit. Florida issues a license to carry both concealed weapons and firearms, but others license only the concealed carry of firearms. Some states do not recognize out-of-state permits to carry a firearm at all, so it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> laws of each state when traveling with a handgun.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} {{exposure}} to HZE nuclei on spatial learning, memory behavior, and neuronal signaling have been tested, and threshold doses have also been considered for such effects. It will be <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> mechanisms {{that are involved in}} these deficits to extrapolate the results to other dose regimes, particle types, and, eventually, astronauts. Studies on rats were performed using the Morris water maze test 1 month after whole-body irradiation with 1.5 Gy of 1 GeV/u 56Fe-ions. Irradiated rats demonstrated cognitive impairment that was similar to that seen in aged rats. This leads to the possibility that an increase in the amount of ROS may be responsible for the induction of both radiation- and age-related cognitive deficits.|$|E

25|$|When {{protecting}} the coastline it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> how the sedimentary budget {{can be affected}} when implementing appropriate coastal protecting techniques. Often management plans for coastal erosion have seen the use of ‘hard’ engineering structures {{as a means of}} {{protecting the}} coastline from recession. In particular groynes which are used to trap the longshore drift of sediment that often deprives a beach. Groynes have the ability to change the coast's sediment budget, accreting up drift beaches {{but at the same time}} starving down drift beaches. This management approach is not used so much these days, with modern knowledge of coastal dynamics promoting the use of ‘soft’, natural approaches such as nourishment and preservation of natural systems such as dunes.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the triumphal arch {{is often associated with}} ancient Roman architecture. To fully understand this development however it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> importance of basic arches in Roman civilization. The Romans had learned how to construct effective arches from the Etruscans, who lived in central Italy. This knowledge had a major impact on the architecture of Roman civilization. As a result, the Romans used arches for things such as aqueducts, amphitheaters, bridges, and domed temples. They had effectively used the arch in various aspects of their civilization and city structure. Since the Romans had effectively perfected this architectural structure, one could conclude that the arch symbolized perfection and triumph in Roman society. Monumental gateways had already been in use for hundreds of years by civilizations such as the Hittites, Assyrians, Babylonians and Myceneans.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{maps are}} very <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> {{structure}} {{and organization of}} genomes from which evolution patterns and syntenic relationships between species can be deduced. Genetic maps also {{provide a framework for}} the mapping of genes of interest and estimating the magnitude of their effects and aid our understanding of genotype/phenotype associations. DH populations have become standard resources in genetic mapping for species in which DHs are readily available. Doubled haploid populations are ideal for genetic mapping. It is possible to produce a genetic map within two years of the initial cross regardless of the species. Map construction is relatively easy using a DH population derived from a hybrid of two homozygous parents as the expected segregation ratio is simple, i.e. 1:1. DH populations have now been used to produce genetic maps of barley, rapeseed, rice, wheat, and pepper. DH populations {{played a major role in}} facilitating the generation of the molecular marker maps in eight crop species.|$|E

25|$|Soil carbon {{storage is}} an {{important}} function of terrestrial ecosystems. Soil contains more carbon than plants and the atmosphere combined. Understanding what maintains the soil carbon pool is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> current distribution of carbon on Earth, {{and how it will}} respond to environmental change. While much research has been done on how plants, free-living microbial decomposers, and soil minerals affect this pool of carbon, it is recently coming to light that mycorrhizal fungi—symbiotic fungi that associate with roots of almost all living plants—may {{play an important role in}} maintaining this pool as well. Measurements of plant carbon allocation to mycorrhizal fungi have been estimated to be 5-20% of total plant carbon uptake, and in some ecosystems the biomass of mycorrhizal fungi can be comparable to the biomass of fine roots. Recent research has shown that mycorrhizal fungi hold 50 to 70 percent of the total carbon stored in leaf litter and soil on forested islands in Sweden. Turnover of mycorrhizal biomass into the soil carbon pool is thought to be rapid and has been shown in some ecosystems to be the dominant pathway by which living carbon enters the soil carbon pool.|$|E

500|$|... "Al Aaraaf" [...] {{is thick}} with allusions and, because of this, is often avoided by {{scholars}} because, as writer Arthur Hobson Quinn notes, {{it can be}} [...] "unintelligible". Nevertheless, Quinn says it possesses qualities which are <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> development of Poe's skills as a poet. [...] "Al Aaraaf" [...] mixes historical facts, religious mythology and elements of Poe's imagination. The poem primarily focuses on the afterlife, ideal love, and ideal beauty in relation to passion. The majority of the poem focuses on this reaching for ideal beauty and aesthetics. Characters in the poem serve as representative symbols of personified emotions. The goddess Nesace is beauty, Ligeia represents the music in nature, Ianthe and Angelo are creatures of passion.|$|E
