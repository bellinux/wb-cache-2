5|$|The Opel Monza Concept is a four-seat coupe plug-in hybrid {{concept car}} with <b>gullwing</b> door {{unveiled}} at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show. The concept shares {{the same basic}} plug-in hybrid setup as the Chevrolet Volt and Opel Ampera, but using a turbocharged 1 L 3-cylinder natural gas-powered engine as its range extender instead of General Motors’ current 1.4 L gasoline engine. According to Opel, this concept is the role-model {{for the next generation}} of Opel cars, and because of its modular chassis design, future cars based on it would be able to accommodate gasoline, diesel or electric power.|$|E
25|$|Opening upwards, {{the doors}} evoke {{the image of}} a seagull's wings. In French they are portes {{papillon}} (butterfly doors). The papillon door, slightly different in its architecture from a <b>gullwing</b> door – designed by Jean Bugatti in 1939 Type 64, 14 years before Mercedes-Benz produced its similar, famous 300SL <b>gullwing</b> door – is a precursor, but is often overlooked when discussing gull-wing design. Conventional car doors are typically hinged at the front-facing edge of the door and the door swings outward in a horizontal plane.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gullwing</b> {{doors are}} common in kit cars and many were made that are not {{included}} on this list. They were almost always {{one of the most}} mechanically problematic parts of these vehicles.|$|E
50|$|The Eyre Creek is a {{river in}} the Southland Region of New Zealand’s South Island. It is a {{tributary}} of the Mataura River with a braided channel and with its confluence near the small town of Athol. It rises on the eastern side of Jane Peak in the Eyre Mountains south-west of Lake Wakatipu. It has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it supports breeding colonies of the endangered black-billed <b>gull.West</b> of Athol it is crossed by State Highway 6 and the Around the Mountains Cycle Trail.|$|R
25|$|In 2009, AC has {{licensed}} <b>Gullwing</b> GmbH in Germany, dba AC-Automotive, {{to produce}} the AC MK VI, with an aluminium coated composite body and powered by a 6.2 litre 440hp LS3 Chevrolet engine, or a 550hp supercharged version.|$|E
25|$|Other {{disadvantages}} {{of the system}} were {{not so easy to}} address. For example, the gull-wing design makes creating a convertible version of the car harder, as the hinges would be removed with the roof, and standard doors would be needed for the convertible. Mercedes did so when replacing the <b>gullwing</b> coupe altogether with the 300SL roadster in 1958. It was never a concern for DeLorean since no convertible version was ever planned.|$|E
25|$|The {{time machine}} went through several {{variations}} during {{production of the}} first film, Back to the Future. In {{the first draft of}} the screenplay, the time machine was a laser device that was housed in a room. At {{the end of the first}} draft the device was attached to a refrigerator and taken to an atomic bomb test site. Director Robert Zemeckis said in an interview that the idea was scrapped because he did not want children to start climbing into refrigerators and getting trapped inside. In the third draft of the film the time machine was a car, as Zemeckis reasoned that if you were going to make a time machine, you would want it to be mobile. The specific choice of vehicle was a DeLorean DMC-12 for the purposes of it looking like an alien spaceship due to its characteristic <b>gullwing</b> doors (which were inspired by the Mercedes-Benz 300 SL). However, in order to send Marty back to the future, the vehicle had to drive into a nuclear test site. Ultimately this concept was considered too expensive to film, so the power source was changed to lightning.|$|E
500|$|The Mk.9 was {{designed}} around the FIA's Group 6 regulations for sports prototypes, {{allowing for a}} completely custom mid-engine layout that was only limited in terms of engine sizes available to competitors. [...] Closed cockpit bodywork with <b>gullwing</b> doors {{was designed}} by Bob McKee to shroud the mid-engine layout. [...] Standard double wishbone suspension with coil springs were used with disc brakes on each wheel. [...] A [...] fuel tank was placed between the cockpit and turbine, housing Jet A fuel.|$|E
500|$|The {{vehicle is}} calmly lowered {{back down to}} the ground while mist, fire, {{electricity}} and smoke effects spray, and Homer yells that he wants to ride again. Krusty then appears on the TV screen in the loading room and remarks [...] "Well, that's our ride. Hey! What does THIS do?!". For the Orlando attraction, Krusty is sitting in a control room and pushes an emergency button on a control panel, causing the vehicle to vibrate, ending the ride. In the Hollywood version, Krusty is sitting in a control room and takes a picture of the guests (The on-ride photo is taken here for the Hollywood attraction). After the <b>gullwing</b> doors on the car lift up, guests exit the ride.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2010 German {{manufacturer}} <b>Gullwing,</b> {{a specialist}} German firm which held a minority share in TVR, {{said they would}} start producing a new car from September 2010. Boss Juergen Mohr said [...] "Having been a TVR owner, I {{think this will be}} the best TVR ever." [...] He also confirmed the company was planning new models, possibly with alternative drivetrains. [...] "I can imagine everything, even electric-powered cars," [...] Mohr said.|$|E
50|$|When the car {{went into}} {{production}} as the Luton <b>Gullwing</b> many examples were bought for racing. In 1962 Stephen Minoprio was the Autosport 1000cc GT Champion in his <b>Gullwing</b> - setting 7 lap {{records in the}} process.|$|E

5000|$|The first car, the Xylon, {{which had}} <b>gullwing</b> doors and a {{windscreen}} in four panels, was nicknamed the [...] "Ugly Duckling". A total of nine, aimed at 750 Motor Club events, {{were built in}} 1959 and 1960. For production the body was made less radical but initially retained the <b>gullwing</b> doors. It was powered by a choice of Ford engines varying from 997 cc to 1498 cc and had Standard 10 and Triumph Herald steering and suspension components. 39 were made up to 1963.|$|E

50|$|In 1981, it was {{reported}} there were plans to make a 4-door version of the car (perhaps on a longer wheelbase) for 1983. It {{was to have been}} of stainless steel, and with <b>gullwing</b> doors.|$|E
5000|$|The C112, {{which also}} {{featured}} <b>gullwing</b> doors, {{was equipped with}} the new 6.0-litre V12 engine, with the standard 300 kW (408 hp) and peak torque of 580 Nm. The major systems tested on this vehicle were: ...|$|E
5000|$|Because {{the doors}} {{stay within the}} car's track {{throughout}} their range of movement, they are useful when parking in tight spaces. A <b>gullwing</b> door style offers similar visibility, but the doors swing out from the car's area slightly.|$|E
