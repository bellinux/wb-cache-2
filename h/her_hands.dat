5|$|Daenerys Targaryen {{takes one}} of the dragon eggs and places it on a glowing-hot brazier. She reaches in {{and picks up the}} blisteringly hot egg. Her handmaiden rushes in to take the hot egg from <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> burning herself in the process, but Daenerys's hands are {{completely}} unscathed.|$|E
5|$|The green {{complexion}} {{is associated}} with deep knowledge and is also the colour of Budha, the presiding deity of the planet Mercury who governs intelligence. Matangi is often depicted with a parrot in <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> representing speech. The veena symbolizes her association with music.|$|E
5|$|There was {{no blood}} on her feet or other debris, such as the sugar {{that was on the}} downstairs floor. Low traces of lead were found on <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> and {{forehead}} at postmortem, but the levels were consistent with the everyday handling of things around the house. A scientist, Mr Elliott, testified that if she had loaded 18 cartridges into a magazine he would expect to see more lead on <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> The {{blood on her}} nightdress was consistent with her own, and no trace of firearm-discharge residue was on it. Given that she was wearing just a nightdress, {{it was hard to see}} how she could have carried the cartridges.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Her</b> <b>hand</b> was cut off, “and {{she left}} with <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> {{dripping}} with blood.” ...|$|R
60|$|With an {{impatient}} gesture she threw down {{the book and}} passed <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> across <b>her</b> eyes, then seemed astonished to find that <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> was wet.|$|R
6000|$|... (She is {{bending over}} Chalmers, <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> on his wrist, when suddenly, {{as a sign}} he is recovering, he violently flings <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> off and {{straightens}} up.) ...|$|R
5|$|After {{moving to}} Amsterdam, Anne and Margot Frank were {{enrolled}} in school—Margot in public school and Anne in a Montessori school. Margot demonstrated ability in arithmetic, and Anne showed aptitude for reading and writing. Anne's friend, Hanneli Goslar, later recalled that from early childhood, Frank frequently wrote, although she shielded her work with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> and refused to discuss the content of her writing.|$|E
5|$|Alisia {{attacks by}} {{shooting}} streaks of lightning from <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> The attack automatically targets enemies in range but gets weaker with each volley as Alisia's power is depleted. Her power recharges when she stops attacking; when fully charged, it {{allows her to}} unleash a multi-target attack, hitting every enemy on the screen. The energy system introduces an element of strategy, encouraging the player to manage Alisia's power to have her able to defend herself at critical moments.|$|E
5|$|James Bond is {{assigned}} to aid the defection of a KGB officer, General Georgi Koskov, covering his escape from a concert hall in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia during intermission. During the mission, Bond notices that the KGB sniper assigned to prevent Koskov's escape is a female cellist from the orchestra. Disobeying his orders to kill the sniper, he instead shoots the rifle from <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> then uses the Trans-Siberian Pipeline to smuggle Koskov {{across the border into}} Austria and then on to Britain.|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{last she}} {{extended}} <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> For {{the first time}} I wished to take {{her in my arms}} and kiss her. I did kiss <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> many times.|$|R
60|$|She {{suddenly}} struck <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> on <b>her</b> {{skirt with}} a wild motion, and bent down, doubled with laughter. Then {{she rose and}} covered her face with <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|R
6000|$|FITZSIMMONS. Glad to see you, Harry. [He wrings <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> {{so that it}} hurts.] Glad to see you again, Harry. [He {{continues}} wringing <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and pumping <b>her</b> arm.] ...|$|R
5|$|Pearl {{receives}} an emergency call when another super villain attacks. During the fight, Pearl sees Olivia {{caught in an}} explosion. Believing her friend dead, Pearl attacks the villain directly and suffers serious burns to <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> and face. She faints after she subdues him. She awakens in a hospital and finds herself healed except for her hair.|$|E
5|$|Saxobeats was commercialized {{with three}} {{different}} covers shot by Andrei Nemirschi. For European standard releases, it featured Stan wearing a bob {{in front of a}} black-white backdrop, with one of <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> being attached to her head. In Japan, the release was accompanied by a photograph of the singer standing with headphones on her shoulders against a black background. All deluxe editions featured Stan leaning on a plastic mannequin, sporting a blue blouse along with various accessories on her hand.|$|E
5|$|The scene changes again, now to bright {{daylight}} and blue sky. Two men are driving an old Alfa Romeo Giulietta Spider passo corto down an empty road. As {{one of the}} men helps the girl up, she spreads her wings and he holds <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> while she gains confidence. With a nudge she is airborne, but she seems hesitant and afraid as he lets go.|$|E
6000|$|She {{gave him}} <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and said, [...] "Good-bye, Clive," [...] but <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> {{did not return}} his pressure, and dropped to her side, when he let it go.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks. You're very amiable." [...] He {{still held}} <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> He pressed it. The {{pressure}} was not returned, but <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> seemed to quiver and throb in his {{like a bird}} held there. For the time neither of them spoke, and it seemed a long time. Staniford found himself carrying <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> towards his lips; and she was helplessly, trustingly, letting him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who says so?" [...] and she {{struggled}} {{as though to}} pull <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> away, but he held her as though in truth <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> had gone from her for ever.|$|R
5|$|Years earlier, Angier and Borden work as shills for Milton the Magician, {{alongside}} Cutter {{and assistant}} Julia, Angier's wife. Milton's famous trick is the water tank trick, where Julia is bound in ropes and dropped {{in a water}} tank from which she frees herself and escapes. Borden, with Julia's consent, ties <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> with a riskier slip knot. Julia fails to slip the knot and drowns, devastating Angier and fueling his deep-seated grudge against Borden.|$|E
5|$|Zero Mission is {{the first}} game in the Metroid series to include a {{sequence}} in which the player controls Samus without her Power Suit. In {{this portion of the}} game, Samus is more vulnerable to damage, must crawl through ducts on <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> and knees without the help of her Morph Ball mode, and has a weak pistol that briefly stuns enemies as her only weapon. However, Samus retains all energy tanks she acquired previously.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of her {{grandson}} in August 1963, Calment lived on her own from age 88 until shortly before her 110th birthday, when she decided to move to a nursing home. Her move was precipitated by the winter of 1985 which froze the water pipes in her house (she never used heating in the winter) and caused frostbite in <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> According to one of her doctors, she had hitherto been healthy but began showing signs of senescence (or aging) at this point.|$|E
60|$|Mary put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> {{over his}} mouth and began to chide him for his awfulness, whereupon he kissed the palm of <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and put his head closer to hers.|$|R
60|$|She put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> {{out through}} the door. He took it with some little surprise; it was not often in his {{experience}} that she gave him <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> of <b>her</b> own accord.|$|R
60|$|The doctor, without answering, {{looked at}} her gravely. Knowing {{she would not be}} allowed to keep the child much longer, the woman kissed him again; and she passed <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> down his body till she came to his feet; she held the right foot in <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and felt the five small toes; and then slowly passed <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> over the left one. She gave a sob.|$|R
5|$|Artwork by Gee Vaucher and Penny Rimbaud, {{including}} {{a recording of}} the original 'Thatchergate Tape', featured {{as part of the}} 'Peculiar People' show at the Focal Point Gallery in Southend on Sea during the Spring of 2016, part of a series of events celebrating the history of 'Radical Essex'. Vaucher's painting 'Oh America', featuring an image of the Statue of Liberty hiding her face with <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> was used as {{the front page of the}} UK Daily Mirror newspaper to mark the election of Donald Trump as US President on November 9, 2016. From November 2016 to February 2017 the Firstsite art gallery in Colchester, hosted a retrospective of Gee Vaucher's artwork.|$|E
5|$|Blood {{and urine}} samples {{indicated}} {{that she had}} taken the anti-psychotic drug haloperidol, and several days earlier had used cannabis. There were no marks on her body suggestive of a struggle. The firearms officer who first saw her said her feet and hands were clean, her fingernails manicured and not broken, and her fingertips free of blood, dirt or powder. There was no trace of lead dust. The rifle magazine would have been loaded at least twice during the killings; this would usually leave lubricant and material from the bullets on the hands. A scenes-of-crimes officer, DC Hammersley, said there were bloodstains {{on the back of}} her right hand, but that otherwise <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> were clean.|$|E
5|$|During the present, the man apologizes to {{his lover}} {{and they are}} reconciled. In another flashback, he attacks someone who plays pool with his lover. Eminem joins Rihanna {{in front of the}} burning house for the final verse. Meanwhile, after the flashback, the woman comes home and locks herself in the {{bathroom}} to stop her abusive lover from entering. In another scene, the fire on her palms vanishes as she clasps <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> Flames later engulf Eminem and the couple, who are then shown fighting in front of the burning house. In the end, the couple stays together and the video returns to their first scene, in which they sleep.|$|E
60|$|He {{would begin}} by {{touching}} <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> She feels the intention, and draws <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> back. His eyes are then fixed upon her, she knows, though her own {{see nothing but}} the grass.|$|R
60|$|Again {{she touched}} the chieftain's hair and earrings, and let <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> drop down along his sleeve to his hard, brown <b>hand.</b> Then <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> fell to <b>her</b> side with a {{resigned}} action.|$|R
50|$|Several days later, Mr. Bennet asks {{if he can}} see <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> {{with the}} stitches. When they unravel the cloth around <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> they are both {{surprised}} to see not even a small scratch.|$|R
5|$|Eva also visited Switzerland {{during her}} European tour, a visit {{that has been}} viewed as {{the worst part of}} the trip. According to the book Evita: A Biography by John Barnes, while she {{traveled}} down a street with many people crowding her car, someone threw two stones and smashed the windshield. She threw <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> up in shock, but was not injured. Later, while sitting with the Foreign Minister, protesters threw tomatoes at her. The tomatoes hit the Foreign Minister and splattered on Eva's dress. After these two events, Eva had had enough, and after two months returned to Argentina.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, editor Hugh Hefner began {{publishing}} Playboy and {{the magazine}} became popular {{because of its}} early Playmates, such as Mansfield, Marilyn Monroe, Bettie Page, and Anita Ekberg. Mansfield posed nude for the February 1955 issue of Playboy, modeling in pajamas raised so that the bottoms of her breasts showed. This increased the magazine's circulation and helped launch Mansfield's career. Beginning in February 1955, she formed a long-standing relationship with Playboy. Shortly afterward, she posed for the Playboy calendar, covering her breasts with <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> Playboy featured Mansfield every February from 1955 to 1958, and again in 1960.|$|E
5|$|In the four-armed form, one of {{the left}} arms rests on Nandi's head, while the other is bent in kataka pose and holds a nilotpala (blue lotus) or hangs loosely at her side. In the three-armed representation, the left hand holds a flower, a mirror or a parrot. In the case of {{two-armed}} icons, the left hand rests on Nandi's head, hangs loose or holds either a flower, a mirror or a parrot. The parrot may be also perched on Parvati's wrist. <b>Her</b> <b>hand(s)</b> is/are adorned with ornaments like a keyura (anklet) or kankana (bangles).|$|E
6000|$|She puts <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> behind <b>her,</b> {{opens the}} door, and slips through, [...] leaving BILL to turn, {{following}} {{the direction of}} her eyes, and [...] see FREDA with the cloak still in <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|R
60|$|He sat holding <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> He {{could not}} talk nor think. It was a comfort, however, to sit holding <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> She was {{dissatisfied}} and miserable. He {{was not with}} her; she was nothing.|$|R
60|$|Holding the cup in <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> Gudruda bent forward, {{staring down}} the skali. Then she cried aloud, {{pointing}} to the door, and the cup fell clattering from <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and rolled along the ground.|$|R
