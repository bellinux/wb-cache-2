40|$|We study <b>intertwining</b> {{operator}} algebras {{introduced and}} constructed by Huang. In {{the case that}} the <b>intertwining</b> operator algebras involve <b>intertwining</b> operators among irreducible modules for their vertex operator subalgebras, a number of results on <b>intertwining</b> operator algebras were given in [H 9] but some of the proofs were postponed to an unpublished monograph. In this paper, we give the proofs of these results in [H 9] and we formulate and prove results for general <b>intertwining</b> operator algebras without assuming that the modules involved are irreducible. In particular, we construct fusing and braiding isomorphisms for general <b>intertwining</b> operator algebras and prove that they satisfy the genus-zero Moore-Seiberg equations. We show that the Jacobi identity for <b>intertwining</b> operator algebras is equivalent to generalized rationality, commutativity and associativity properties of <b>intertwining</b> operator algebras. We introduce the locality for <b>intertwining</b> operator algebras and show that the Jacobi identity is equivalent to the locality, assuming that other axioms hold. Moreover, we establish that any two of the three properties, associativity, commutativity and skew-symmetry, imply the other (except that when deriving skew-symmetry from associativity and commutativity, more conditions are needed). Finally, we show that three definitions of <b>intertwining</b> operator algebras are equivalent. Comment: 59 pages, 2 figures. Several typos corrected. Some references cited in the text. Everything else is the same. The definition of <b>intertwining</b> operator algebras and some related technical definitions in this paper are from arXiv:q-alg/ 9704008 by different author.

40|$|The <b>intertwining</b> {{relations}} between cosubnormal and closed hyponormal (resp. cohyponormal and closed subnormal) operators are studied. In particular, an asymmetric Putnam [...] Fuglede theorem for unbounded operators is proved. Introduction The Putnam [...] Fuglede theorem [12] {{says that if}} a bounded linear mapping <b>intertwines</b> two normal operators, then it <b>intertwines</b> their adjoints. Unfortunately, the Putnam [...] Fuglede theorem is no longer true for subnormal operators. However, as noticed by Furuta (cf. [2, 3]), an asymmetric version of it remains true for bounded subnormals; furthermore, subnormals can be replaced by more general bounded operators (cf. [17, 18, 14, 15, 8, 21]). In particular, the following holds true: if a bounded linear mapping <b>intertwines</b> a cohyponormal operator with a hyponormal one (both are bounded), then it <b>intertwines</b> their adjoints.

The related polynomial algebra of supersymmetry is constructed. The problems of minimization and of reducibility of a matrix <b>intertwining</b> operator are considered and the criteria of minimizability and of reducibility are presented.

40|$|We reexamine the proofs of isospectrality of the {{counterexample}} domains to Kac' question `Can one {{hear the}} shape of a drum?' from an analytical viewpoint.

On a representative pair of counterexample domains, we use these criteria to show that the similarity transform <b>intertwines</b> not only the Laplacians with Neumann (or Dirichlet) boundary conditions but also any two appropriately defined elliptic operators on these domains, even if they are not self-adjoint.
