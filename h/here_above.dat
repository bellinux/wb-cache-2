2500|$|Market Square is the {{historic}} trading {{centre of the}} town, and indeed markets are still held here weekly today. [...] The site at {{the centre of the}} square was formerly occupied by the market house [...] which served on the ground level as an open covered market. [...] Stall holders would pay extra to have their market stall <b>here,</b> <b>above</b> {{it would have been a}} town meeting room, where the stallholders' fees were collected and kept. Often these upper chambers also served as a form of town hall, a similar market house is at the nearby town of Amersham. [...] The Market House was demolished in 1866: by this time markets while still a popular occurrence had been replaced in importance by regular and permanent shops. Ten years later on the site was built the clocktower, constructed of local stone, in the Gothic revival style, designed by the local architect D Brandon, also responsible for the Corn Exchange and many other public buildings in the town. [...] The clocktower complete with spire sits on a slightly raised dais from the rest of the square and has been used as a platform from which important speeches have been made in the past. [...] The horse troughs that had been placed adjacent to the clocktower when it was constructed have since been removed.|$|E
2500|$|From {{west to east}} across North Africa, {{eight of}} these new Berbers states have been identified, being the kingdoms of: Altava (near present-day Tlemcen); the Ouarsenis (by Tiaret); Hodna; the Aures (southern Numidia); the Nemencha; the Dorsale (at Thala, south of El Kef); Capsus (at Capsa); and, Cabaon (in Tripolitania, at Oea). The eastern-most five of these Berber kingdoms were located within the old Africa Proconsularis, and all eight were within the now defunct Diocese of Africa (314–432), Carthage its capital. Alike in {{situation}} to the newly formed Germanic kingdoms within the fallen Empire in Europe to the north, these Berber kingdoms served two disparate populations: the Romani who were [...] "the settled communities of provincial citizens" [...] and the [...] "barbarians", here the Mauri, [...] "Berber tribes along and beyond the frontier". The Romani contributed the urban resources and fiscal structure for which a civil administration was required, while the Mauri provided fruits of the countryside and satisfied essential military and security requirements. This functional and ethnic duality {{at the core of}} the Berber successor states is reflected in the title of the political leader at Altava (see <b>here</b> <b>above),</b> one Masuna, found on an inscription: rex gent(ium) Maur(orum) et Romanor(um). King Masuna of the Mauri and of the Romans must have been, in some perhaps transformed way, similar to Firmus or Gildo (see above).|$|E
2500|$|Dunbar et al. also {{obtained}} X-ray crystallographic {{data for}} the TBP crystals at different temperatures. With respect to Figure 11, the equatorial Fe(1) atom is on the left, Fe(2) {{is in the middle}} and Fe(3) is on the right. Crystallographic data showed that the average M-L bond lengths for Fe(2) and Fe(3) ions to their respective cyanide ligands at 30 K were 1.94 Å and 1.95 Å and 1.96 Å and 1.96 Å at 110 K, respectively,. This is typical and representative of a LS FeII bond distance. The Fe(1) was significantly higher at 2.11 Å suggesting significant HS FeII character even though typical values reported for HS FeII sites are slightly higher. Typically, bond lengths determined by X-ray crystallography show a small decrease at increasing temperatures due to an increase in the amplitude of atom vibrations, which is the case seen <b>here</b> <b>above</b> 110 K for the average Co-N bond lengths (1.90 Å at 200 K and 1.89 Å at 298 K for the top axial CoIII ion and 1.88 Å at 200 K and 1.84 Å at 298 K for the bottom axial CoIII ion, Figure 11). This however, is not the case for the Fe-N bonds which show a systematic increase. At room temperature, 298 K, the average bond lengths for Fe(1) at 2.17 Å [...] and Fe(3) at 2.15 Å, are typical for HS FeII. The temperature induced change in the cluster geometry indicates a spin transition at these FeII sites. The Fe(2) site does not show a complete spin transition at room temperature however, with an average bond length of only 1.97 Å. Close examination of the crystal structure reveals that Fe(2) is slightly different from the other FeII equatorial sites, in that the 3, 4, 7, 8-tetramethyl-1,10-phenanthroline, (tmphen), ligands on the Fe(1) and Fe(3) centers are engaged in intramolecular p-p interactions with both of the tmphen ligands on the Fe(2) center. With the information provided by these three techniques, it can be concluded that the FeII centers in this pentanuclear complex undergo SCO and that the phenomenon is affected by its coordination and solvent environment.|$|E
