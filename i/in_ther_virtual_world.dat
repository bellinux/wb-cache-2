40|$|In this paper, I {{consider}} whether <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> are history {{in two senses}} of the word. The first explores {{the implications of the}} life-cycle of <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds,</b> especially of their extinction, for thinking about the history of computerbased technologies, as well as their use. The moment when a <b>virtual</b> <b>world</b> “is history” – when it shuts down – reminds us that every <b>virtual</b> <b>world</b> has a history. Histories of individual <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> are inextricably bound up with the intellectual and cultural history of <b>virtual</b> <b>world</b> technologies and communities. The second sense of the <b>virtual</b> <b>world</b> as history brings us directly to issues of historical documentation, digital preservation and curation of <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds.</b> I consider what will remain of <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> after they close down, either individually or perhaps even collectively...|$|R

40|$|About the book] <b>Virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> are computer-generated {{three-dimensional}} {{worlds in}} which participants adopt digital personae, called avatars, to interact with others.

This volume focuses on this use of <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> for providing experiential learning in particular. Some of the questions the volume aims to answer are: To what extent can the experiences of <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> be considered "real"?

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this article is to analyze the {{educational}} and more specifically, the library and information opportunities afforded through <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> such as Second Life. Design/methodology/approach: The article provides an analysis of <b>virtual</b> <b>world</b> opportunities through a review of relevant literature as well as actual applications of <b>virtual</b> <b>world</b> platforms. Findings: <b>Virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> have the potential to provide a rich learning and information environment.

40|$|More than {{a decade}} ago John Perry Barlow envisioned a {{cyberspace}} free from real-world regulation. His vision was flawed. But <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds,</b> in which millions of users around the world spend significant amounts of their time (and money) interacting and transacting with each other, may prove Barlow right after all. In this paper, we look at the universe of these <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> and how <b>virtual</b> <b>world</b> providers compete with each other, trace the likely development of regulatory interdependence and suggest how real-world lawmakers may want to facilitate <b>virtual</b> <b>world</b> self-governance. As <b>virtual</b> <b>world</b> providers transform themselves from offering content to offering a virtual space in which users can settle with their intellectual property, they begin to compete over the regulatory frameworks they offer their users. Users free to take their property and move to a different <b>virtual</b> <b>world</b> at relatively low cost, unleash intriguing regulatory dynamics between the <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds.</b> Will they engage in touch regulatory competition? Will pockets of cooperation develop and if so why and where? Or will <b>virtual</b> <b>world</b> providers much like Tiebout suggested differentiate based on user preferences, and will the <b>virtual</b> <b>world</b> universe hence reach a stable equilibrium? A similar dynamic may ensue among real-world lawmakers attempting to regulate <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds.</b> <b>Virtual</b> <b>world</b> providers may relocate to more welcoming jurisdictions, taking revenue streams with them. Coordination among real-world regulators may offer reprieve from a potential regulatory race to the bottom, but only temporarily. The more real-world lawmakers are tempted to reign in <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds,</b> the likelier that <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> will become decentralized like peer-to-peer networks, leaving real-world jurisdictions without an easily identifiable entity to regulate. To avoid the birth of such a Barlowian virtual space, we suggest real-world lawmakers are better off facilitating the inculcation of real-world governance values into the nascent <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> of self-governance. ...|$|R

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This {{research}} aims at {{developing a}} different kind of <b>virtual</b> <b>world</b> that is dynamically designed and implemented as needed. Currently, most <b>virtual</b> <b>world</b> designs are considered static. Similar to the physical world, these worlds are pre-defined prior to their use. The resultant environments serve certain purposes but do not take into consideration possible changes to the purposes during their use, changes which often occur when the occupants interact with the environments and with each other. <b>Virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> as networked environments can be flexibly configured and programmed. This flexibility makes it possible to consider <b>virtual</b> <b>world</b> designs in terms of dynamics and autonomy, reflecting the changing needs of different moments. To achieve dynamic designs of <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds,</b> this study applies a computational approach using rational design agents. A Generative Design Agent (GDA) model is developed that specifies computational processes for reasoning and designing in <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds.</b> The GDAs serve as personal design agents to the <b>virtual</b> <b>world</b> occupants. Design formalisms for <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> are also addressed. The design component of a GDA is supported by the application of a generative design grammar. On one hand, generative design grammars serve as the generative force to be applied by the GDAs for <b>virtual</b> <b>world</b> design automation. On the other hand, each grammar defines coherent stylistic characterisations shared by the <b>virtual</b> <b>world</b> designs it generates. The technical outcomes of the research consist of the GDA model and a generative design grammar framework. The framework provides guidelines and strategies to designers for developing generative design grammars that produce different design languages for <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds,</b> rather than predefine every detail of all possible <b>virtual</b> <b>world</b> designs. GDAs monitor the <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> and the various activities that occur in the worlds, interpret the occupants’ needs in the <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> and the state of the worlds based on these observations, hypothesise design goals in order to satisfy these needs, and finally apply generative design grammars to provide <b>virtual</b> <b>world</b> designs for the moment, or initiate other actions in the worlds, according to the current design goals, on behalf of the occupants. The development of the GDA model and the generative design grammar framework provides new perspectives for understanding and developing <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds.</b> The GDA model challenges the conventional way that <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> are designed and implemented, and this leads to dynamic designs of <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds.</b> The generative design grammar framework provides a computational approach to formally defining design languages for <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds...</b>|$|R
