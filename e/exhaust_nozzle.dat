5|$|CFMI {{tested both}} a mixed and unmixed exhaust design at the {{beginning}} of development; most variants of the engine have an unmixed <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle.</b> Only the high-power CFM56-5C, designed for the Airbus A340, has a mixed-flow <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle.</b>|$|E
5|$|GE and SNECMA {{also tested}} the {{effectiveness}} of chevrons on reducing jet noise. After examining configurations in the wind tunnel, CFMI chose to flight-test chevrons built into the core <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The chevrons reduced jet noise by 1.3 perceived loudness decibels during takeoff conditions, and are now offered as an option with the CFM56 for the Airbus A321.|$|E
5|$|The intake {{design for}} Concorde's engines was {{especially}} critical. The intakes had to provide low distortion levels (to prevent engine surge) and high efficiency for all likely ambient temperatures {{to be met}} in cruise. They had to provide adequate subsonic performance for diversion cruise and low engine-face distortion at take-off. They also had to provide an alternate path for excess intake air during engine throttling or shutdowns. The variable intake features required to meet all these requirements consisted of front and rear ramps, a dump door, an auxiliary inlet and a ramp bleed to the <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle.</b>|$|E
40|$|Adjustable-stator {{turbines}} {{are applied}} to turbojet engines and probable performance is compared with conventional engines with and without variable-area <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzles.</b> Variation in stator-exit angle and exhaust area was not excessive for wide ranges of engine output. Variation in turbine efficiency for contemporary turbines equipped with adjustable stators was small. Improvements from 4. 5 to 17 percent in over-all engine specific fuel consumption over conventional engines and from 2 to 8. 5 percent over engines equipped with only adjustable-area <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzles</b> were obtained at 60 -percent rated power with adjustable-stator turbines and variable-area <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzles.</b> The improvements depend on design parameters...|$|R

25|$|In this {{configuration}} most of {{the bypass}} flow is ducted to the wing nozzles, known as roll posts. Some is used for cooling the rear <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle,</b> known as the 3-bearing swivel duct nozzle (3BSD). At the same time an auxiliary inlet is opened {{on top of the}} aircraft to provide additional air to the engine with low distortion during the hover.|$|E
2500|$|Engine: Chevy 350 ZZ3 (off-road racing motor). Instead of {{a single}} jet exhaust, this Batmobile had a [...] "boattail" [...] rear flanked by {{separate}} fenders, each with three smaller <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzles.</b>|$|R

25|$|The Eurofighter Typhoon is {{fitted with}} two Eurojet EJ200 engines, each capable of {{providing}} up to 60kN (13,500lbf) of dry thrust and >90kN (20,230lbf) with afterburners. The EJ200 engine combines the leading technologies {{from each of the}} four European companies, using advanced digital control and health monitoring; wide chord aerofoils and single crystal turbine blades; and a convergent / divergent <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle</b> to give excellent thrust-to-weight ratio, multimission capability, supercruise performance, low fuel consumption, low cost of ownership, modular construction and significant growth potential.|$|E
25|$|The J75 was {{somewhat}} {{larger than the}} J57 in the F-102A, and had greater mass flow. This demanded changes to the inlets to allow more airflow, and {{this led to the}} further refinement of using a variable-geometry inlet duct to allow the intakes to be tuned to best performance across a wide range of supersonic speeds. This change also led to the ducts being somewhat shorter. The fuselage grew slightly longer, and was cleaned up and simplified in many ways. The wing was slightly enlarged in area, and a redesigned vertical tail surface was used. The engine's 2-position afterburner <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle</b> was also used for idle thrust control. The nozzle was held open reducing idle thrust by 40% giving slower taxiing and less brake wear.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the limited}} {{success of the}} 150, drastic changes were {{introduced}} to improve performance and ease of maintenance. The RD-10 engine, rated at [...] of thrust, {{was moved to the}} front of the nose and its cowling formed the bottom of the forward fuselage. This position minimized thrust losses due to the length of the intake duct and allowed the engine to be changed much more easily than its predecessor. The cockpit was widened and moved to a position over the mid-set wings, even with the engine's <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The pilot's seat back was armored and he was protected by an armor plate to his front and a bulletproof windscreen. Three fuel tanks were positioned ahead of the cockpit and one behind it with a total capacity of [...] of fuel. The removable, mid-mounted wings used several different laminar flow airfoils over their span. Each wing had a single spar, slotted flaps and ailerons. The tricycle undercarriage retracted into the fuselage, which meant that the aircraft had a very narrow ground track. The aircraft was armed with three [...] Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon, two on the starboard side of the aircraft's nose and the other on the port side. Each gun had 50 rounds of ammunition.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} {{flyover noise}} and thrust and {{to investigate whether}} flight velocity significantly affects the noise of <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzles,</b> a series of flight tests was conducted on three different <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzles</b> of a type suitable for supersonic transport aircraft. The tests were conducted using an F- 106 B aircraft modified to carry two underwing nacelles, each containing a calibrated turbojet engine. A flyover altitude of 91 meters (300 ft) and a Mach number of 0. 4 provided acoustic data that were repeatable to within + or - 1. 5 PNdB. Flyover results showed that an auxiliary inlet ejector nozzle was the quietest of the nozzles tested; flight velocity appeared to reduce its noise...|$|R
50|$|The ecoDemonstrator Program {{followed}} Boeing's Quiet Technology Demonstrator program, which operated between 2001 and 2005 {{to develop}} a quieter engine using chevrons on {{the rear of the}} nacelle and <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzles.</b> These chevrons were later adopted on the 747-8 and 787 Dreamliner aircraft.|$|R

2500|$|The {{variable}} geometry <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle,</b> {{developed by}} SNECMA, {{consisted of two}} [...] "eyelids" [...] which varied {{their position in the}} exhaust flow dependent on the flight regime, for example when fully closed (into the exhaust flow) they acted as thrust reversers, aiding deceleration from landing to taxi speed.|$|E
2500|$|The lift for the STOVL {{version in}} the hover is {{obtained}} from a 2-stage lift fan (about 46%) {{in front of the}} engine, a vectoring <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle</b> (about 46%), and a nozzle in each wing using [...] fan air from the bypass duct(about 8%). These relative contributions to the total lift are based on thrust values of 18,680lb, 18,680lb and 3,290lb respectively. Another source gives thrust values of 20,000lb, 18,000lb and 3,900lb respectively.|$|E

40|$|Interest in low-observable {{aircraft}} and in lowering an aircraft's exhaust system weight sparked {{decades of research}} for fixed geometry <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzles.</b> The desire for such integrated <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzles</b> was the catalyst for new fluidic control techniques; including throat area control, expansion control, and thrust-vector angle control. This paper summarizes a variety of fluidic thrust vectoring concepts that have been tested both experimentally and computationally at NASA Langley Research Center. The nozzle concepts are divided into three categories according to the method used for fluidic thrust vectoring: the shock vector control method, the throat shifting method, and the counterflow method. This paper explains the thrust vectoring mechanism for each fluidic method, provides examples of configurations tested for each method, and discusses {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of each method...|$|R

2500|$|Boundaries are of four types: fixed, movable, real, and imaginary. For example, in an engine, a fixed {{boundary}} {{means the}} piston is locked at its position, within which a constant volume process might occur. If the piston {{is allowed to}} move that boundary is movable while the cylinder and cylinder head boundaries are fixed. [...] For closed systems, boundaries are real while for open systems boundaries are often imaginary. In {{the case of a}} jet engine, a fixed imaginary boundary might be assumed at the intake of the engine, fixed boundaries along the surface of the case and a second fixed imaginary boundary across the <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "lift" [...] mode for {{assisted}} vertical maneuvers, 29,000hp is diverted forward {{through a}} driveshaft from the engine's low-pressure (LP) turbine via a clutch and bevel-gearbox to a vertically mounted, contra-rotating lift fan located {{forward of the}} main engine. The fan efflux (low-velocity unheated air) discharges through a thrust vectoring nozzle {{on the underside of}} the aircraft, thus balancing the aft lift generated by the 3BSM. For lateral stability and roll control, bypass air from the engine goes out through a roll-post nozzle in each wing. For pitch control, the areas of <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle</b> and LiftFan inlet are varied conversely to change the balance between them while maintaining their sum, and with constant turbine speed. Yaw control is achieved by yawing the 3BSM. Forward, and even backward, motion is controlled by tilting the 3BSM and LiftFan outlet.|$|E
2500|$|However, in 1979 Pratt & Whitney {{launched}} its PW2000 engine, claiming 8% better fuel efficiency than the -535C for the PW2037 version. Boeing put Rolls-Royce {{under pressure to}} supply a more competitive engine for the 757, and using the more advanced -524 core as a basis, the company produced the [...] thrust RB211-535E4 which entered service in October 1984. While still not quite as efficient as the PW2037, it was more reliable and quieter. Visible differences include a mixed <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle</b> and a bigger fan cone. It {{was also the first}} to use the wide chord fan which increases efficiency, reduces noise and gives added protection against foreign object damage. As a result, {{a relatively small number of}} -535C's were installed on production aircraft, almost all -535Cs are still used with Boeing 757-200s owned by DHL and one aircraft is a charter jet. The majority uses the -535E.|$|E
50|$|Like its {{immediate}} predecessor, the Su-37, the Su-47 is of tandem-triple layout, with canards ahead of wings and tailplanes. Interestingly, the Su-47 has two tailbooms of unequal length outboard of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzles.</b> The shorter boom, on the left-hand side, houses rear-facing radar, while the longer boom houses a brake parachute.|$|R
40|$|PAN AIR is a {{computer}} program for predicting subsonic or supersonic linear potential flow about arbitrary configurations. The program was applied to a highly complex single-engine-cruise V/STOL fighter/attack aircraft. Complexities include a close-coupled canard/wing, large inlets, and four <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzles</b> mounted directly under the wing and against the fuselage. Modeling uncertainties involving canard wake location and flow-through approximation through the inlet and the <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzles</b> were investigated. The recently added streamline capability {{of the program was}} utilized to evaluate visually the predicted flow over the model. PAN AIR results for Mach numbers of 0. 6, 0. 9, and angles of attack of 0, 5, and 10 deg. were compared with data obtained in the Ames 11 - by 11 -Foot Transonic Wind tunnel, at a Reynolds number of 3. 69 x 10 to the 6 th power based on c bar...|$|R
40|$|Jet engine {{calibration}} {{tests were}} conducted in an altitude facility using a contoured bellmouth inlet duct, four fixed-area water-cooled <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzles,</b> and an accurately calibrated thrust measuring system. Accurate determination of the airflow measuring station flow coefficient, the flow and thrust coefficients of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzles,</b> and the experimental and theoretical terms in the nozzle gross thrust equation {{were some of the}} objectives of the tests. A primary objective was to develop a technique to determine gross thrust for the turbojet engine used in this test that could also be used for future engine and nozzle evaluation tests. The probable error in airflow measurement was found to be approximately 0. 6 percent at the bellmouth throat design Mach number of 0. 6. The probable error in nozzle gross thrust measurement was approximated 0. 6 percent at the load cell full-scale reading...|$|R
2500|$|The {{design of}} the Griffon {{featured}} a dual turbojet-ramjet powerplant, with the turbojet enabling unassisted takeoffs (ramjets cannot produce thrust at zero airspeed and thus cannot move an aircraft from a standstill) and the ramjet producing extra thrust at airspeeds above 1,000km/h (600mph). To reduce risks in using the relatively new turbo-ramjet powerplant, the first Griffon (Nord 1500-01 Griffon I) was completed with only the 3,800 kgf thrust ATAR 101F turbojet component. First flown by Andre Turcat on [...] 20 September 1955, the Griffon I proved to be underpowered but plans to install the planned ramjet component were never realised. Despite the lack of power the Griffon I still managed to reach M 1.17. Flying with the Griffon I ceased in April 1957 in favour of the ramjet-equipped Griffon II. Visible {{differences between the two}} aircraft were limited to the smaller intake and two-position <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle</b> of the Griffon I.|$|E
