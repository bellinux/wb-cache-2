Pulling the spring to a greater length causes it to exert a force that brings the spring back toward its <b>equilibrium</b> <b>length.</b> The amount of force can be determined by multiplying the spring constant of the spring by the amount of stretch.|$|E

The bonds relax towards <b>equilibrium</b> <b>lengths,</b> increasing the cohesive energy per bond between atoms, independent of the exact form of the specific interatomic potential. However, the integrated cohesive energy for surface atoms is much lower than bulk atoms due to the reduced coordination number and overall decrease in cohesive energy.|$|R

30|$|Several {{methods have}} been {{introduced}} in [13 – 15] {{to cope with the}} problem for range-based. These methods model nodes as masses connected using springs, referred to as mass spring method. The mass spring method is an optimization tool minimizing the difference between an interest and a desire. In distributed systems [14, 15, 19], this method is applied for location refinement. After each node recognizes its own location based on information from anchors, it obtains additional distance measurements from neighbors within one or two hops and periodically acquires the estimated information of the neighbors for location refinement. The underlying assumption here is that distance measurements to neighbors have negligible errors since neighbors are closely located. In other words, the distance measurements are considered as the actual distances to the neighbors and the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>lengths</b> (i.e., desires) of the springs. Each node updates its location by forces generated from the differences between the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>lengths</b> and the distance estimations (i.e., interests) with respect to location estimates. This process continues until a state of equilibrium is achieved. In cluster-based systems [13], the mass spring functions as a method to connect local cluster maps. Upon establishing cluster maps, some nodes which are members of more than two clusters become joints and combine them into a global coordinate system.|$|R

40|$|Radial {{equilibrium}} {{lengths of}} the weakly attached, force-generating, and rigor cross-bridges {{are determined by}} recording their resistance to osmotic compression. Radial <b>equilibrium</b> <b>length</b> is the surface-to-surface distance between myosin and actin filaments at which attached cross-bridges are, on average, radially undistorted. We previously proposed that differences in the radial <b>equilibrium</b> <b>length</b> represent differences {{in the structure of}} the actomyosin cross-bridge. Until now the radial <b>equilibrium</b> <b>length</b> had only been determined for various strongly attached cross-bridge states and was found to be distinct for each state examined. In the present work, we demonstrate that weakly attached cross-bridges, in spite of their low affinity for actin, also exert elastic forces opposing osmotic compression, and they are characterized by a distinct radial <b>equilibrium</b> <b>length</b> (12. 0 nm vs. 10. 5 nm for force-generating and 13. 0 nm for rigor cross-bridge). This suggests significant differences in the molecular structure of the attached cross-bridges under these conditions, e. g., differences in the shape of the myosin head or in the docking of the myosin to actin. Thus, the present finding supports our earlier conclusion that there is a structural change in the attached cross-bridge associated with the transition from a weakly bound configuration to the force-generating configuration. The implications for imposing spatial constraints on modeling actomyosin interaction in the filament lattice are discussed...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} the average size of self-avoiding polygons (SAP) with a fixed knot is much larger than that of no topological {{constraint}} if the excluded volume is small {{and the number of}} segments is large. We call it topological swelling. We argue an "enhancement" of the scaling exponent for random polygons with a fixed knot. We study them systematically through SAP consisting of hard cylindrical segments with various different values of the radius of segments. Here we mean by the average size the mean-square radius of gyration. Furthermore, we show numerically that the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>length</b> of a composite knot is given by the sum of those of all constituent prime knots. Here we define the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>length</b> of a knot by such a number of segments that topological entropic repulsions are balanced with the knot complexity in the average size.

30|$|We {{simulate}} the natural frequencies and the acoustic wave propagation characteristics of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) {{of the type}} (8, 0) and (0, 8) using an equivalent atomistic-continuum FE model previously developed {{by some of the}} authors, where the C-C bonds thickness and average equilibrium lengths during the dynamic loading are identified through the minimisation of the system Hamiltonian. A molecular mechanics model based on the UFF potential is used to benchmark the hybrid FE models developed. The acoustic wave dispersion characteristics of the GNRs are simulated using a Floquet-based wave technique used to predict the pass-stop bands of periodic mechanical structures. We show that the thickness and equilibrium lengths do depend on the specific vibration and dispersion mode considered, and that they are in general different from the classical constant values used in open literature (0.34 nm for thickness and 0.142 nm for <b>equilibrium</b> <b>length).</b> We also show the dependence of the wave dispersion characteristics versus the aspect ratio and edge configurations of the nanoribbons, with widening band-gaps that depend on the chirality of the configurations.

40|$|Background: Seasonal {{variations}} in the biological activities of animals are commonly reported in literature. However, these variations are not studied yet in correlation with the structure and function of skeletal muscles in general and their mechanics in particular. Methods: This study was conducted on skeletal muscles of a reptile, Uromastix, {{to determine the effect}} of season on the shape of length-tension curves, active tension, passive tension and tension <b>equilibrium</b> <b>length</b> (TEL). Results: Result demonstrates that active tension obtained from gastrocnemius muscle was found to increase significantly from the winter (December) to peak summer month (June), which showed a significant fall till the second winter (December). The passive tension was also found to increase significantly (P< 0. 0005) from winter (December) to peak summer (June) which also decreased significantly till the second winter (December). Change in both the active and passive tensions has resulted in a rise in the average values of tension <b>equilibrium</b> <b>length</b> from the winter (December) to peak summer (June) and fall till second winter (December). Conclusion: It is concluded that length-tension parameters exhibit variations between different seasons and reflects a dominancy of contractile elements towards summer and elastic elements towards winter in the gastrocnemius muscles of Uromastix...|$|E
40|$|The shear-driven {{drainage}} of capillary grooves {{filled with}} viscous liquid {{is a dynamic}} wetting phenomenon relevant to numerous industrial processes and novel lubricant-infused surfaces. Prior work has reported that a finite length L_∞ of the capillary groove can remain indefinitely filled with liquid even when large shear stresses are applied. The mechanism preventing full drainage is attributed to {{a balance between the}} shear-driven flow and a counterflow driven by capillary pressures caused by deformation of the free surface. The final <b>equilibrium</b> <b>length</b> L_∞ is uniquely determined by physical properties of the filling liquid as well as the geometry and wettability of the capillary. In this work, we examine closely the approach to the final <b>equilibrium</b> <b>length</b> L_∞ and report a crossover to a slow drainage regime that cannot be described by conventional dynamic models considering solely hydrodynamic and capillary forces. The slow drainage regime observed in experiments can be instead modeled by a kinetic equation describing a sequence of random thermally activated transitions between multiple metastable states caused by surface defects with nanoscale dimensions. Our findings provide new insights on the critical role that natural or engineered surface roughness with nanoscale dimensions can play in the imbibition and drainage of capillaries and other dynamic wetting processes in microscale systems...|$|E
