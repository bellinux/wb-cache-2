5000|$|As a 15 year old, wrote, art directed, and {{published}} first science fiction fan magazine in Philadelphia in October 1936 [...] "Fantasy Fiction Telegram", using {{a process called}} <b>hectography.</b>|$|E
50|$|The last {{edition of}} the DZN was just a <b>hectography</b> in A5-format, which {{contained}} the Wehrmachtbericht. The end of the DZN also meant {{the end of a}} German press in the Netherlands.|$|E
50|$|It {{was also}} used in {{professional}} situations; in Macy's advertising department during the 1950s and 1960s, full-page newspaper ad layouts were drawn with hectograph pencils and then duplicated on a hectograph to make file copies for future reference. Before the popularization of spirit duplicators and the mimeograph, there were mechanized <b>hectography</b> machines that used a drum, rather than a simple flat tray of gelatin.|$|E
50|$|The {{government}} of the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture contributed ¥150,000 in 2002 to upgrade the newspaper's printing facilities. A further contribution of ¥800,000 in 2007 enabled the newspaper to upgrade its aging equipment; new equipment they purchased included a <b>hectography</b> machine, a scanner, industrial staplers and paper cutting machines, a blade sharpener, three digital cameras, two digital video cameras, nine computers, two multifunction printers, a laser printer, and two fax machines.|$|E
5000|$|While good-quality, {{reasonably}} rapid copies from a hectograph require fairly specific materials (Aniline dye is {{the most}} effective), passable copies can be produced from a bewildering array of improvised materials on makeshift equipment. Practically speaking, any dye that soaks into the gelatin and can then be drawn out by the available paper will work. This meant that improvised <b>hectography</b> {{assumed the role of}} reproducing nearly every sort of censored material from subversive literature to pornography.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hectography,</b> {{requiring}} limited {{technology and}} leaving few traces behind, has been deemed useful both in low-technology environments and in clandestine circumstances where discretion was necessary. In the earlier 20th century, the process lent itself to small runs of school classroom test papers, church newsletters and science fiction fanzines. Prisoners-of-war at Stalag Luft III (the scene of The Great Escape) and at Colditz Castle during World War II used an improvised hectograph to reproduce documents for a planned escape attempt.|$|E
50|$|The {{hectograph}} {{introduced in}} 1876 or shortly before, was a technology {{in which a}} dye-impregnated master copy, not unlike a ditto master, was laid {{on top of a}} cake pan full of firm gelatin. After the dye soaked into the gelatin, sheets of paper could be laid on top of the gelatin to transfer the image. This was good for 50 copies at most. <b>Hectography</b> was slow and clunky, but it could inspire great intrepidity in its users.|$|E
5000|$|For several years, {{he worked}} to perfect {{a method to}} improve the {{reproduction}} of drawings by printing press. In 1872, he received a patent for his processes {{and set up a}} workshop for what he called the [...] "Heliotype" [...] (a process similar to <b>hectography).</b> Later, he also produced phototypes. In 1880, he joined with the photographer, Hilmar Crone, to create [...] "Pacht & Crones Illustrationsetablissement". Crone left the company in 1885 and was replaced by the drawing teacher, Giovannino von Huth. That same year, Pacht started the [...] "Skandinavisk Panoptikon", a combination wax museum and cabinet of curiosities.|$|E
50|$|Science fiction fanzines used {{a variety}} of {{printing}} methods. Typewriters, school dittos, church mimeos and (if they could afford it) multi-color letterpress or other mid-to-high level printing. Some fans wanted their news spread, others reveled in the artistry and beauty of fine printing. The hectograph, introduced around 1876, was so named because it could produce (in theory) up to a hundred copies. Hecto used an aniline dye, transferred to a tray of gelatin, and paper would be placed on the gel, one sheet at a time, for transfer. Messy and smelly, the process could create vibrant colors for the few copies produced, the easiest aniline dye to make being purple (technically indigo). The next small but significant technological step after hecto is the spirit duplicator, essentially the <b>hectography</b> process using a drum instead of the gelatin. Introduced by Ditto Corporation in 1923, these machines were known for the next six decades as Ditto Machines and used by fans because they were cheap to use and could (with a little effort) print in color.|$|E
40|$|Archives and {{cultural}} facilities consists of vast spectra of different document classes, {{many of which}} are not encountered today anymore. The digitization therefore calls for image enhancement and preprocessing solutions so far not required and hence unsolved. A prominent document class in this context is <b>hectography,</b> which was a inexpensive printing and duplication method, widely used throughout the 20 th century. The major challenge with <b>hectography</b> is poor contrast on the one side and multiple degradation effects on the other side. In this paper a novel preprocessing method for <b>hectography</b> duplicates is proposed which leads to better Optical Character Recognition (OCR) results compared to traditional methods that operate on grayscale images. The proposed method is based on the model confo rm with the independent component analysis. The problem of unwanted Gaussian noise components is considered as well...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} goals of the Contentus use case was to manage and improve the {{technical}} quality of large digital multimedia collections in cultural heritage organizations. Generally, there are two causes for quality impairment of digitized multimedia items: errors during the digitization process and a poor condition of the analog original. While digitization errors may be corrected by re-digitization, any deterioration of analog materials can only be counteracted by digital restoration in post-processing after digitization. This article showcases a unique technique developed in Contentus to restore digitized hectograph archive documents that typically display yellowed paper and faded printing ink. The documents used in this restoration showcase belong to the archive of the Music Information Center the Association of Composers and Musicologists (MIZ) of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR), and were produced between 1960 and 1989. The <b>hectography</b> method was widely adopted in the GDR to copy documents at a large scale. The showcased restoration method enhances the readability of on-screen texts and, as shown by evaluation, lowers the error rate of optical character recognition. In turn, the latter improvement is expected to improve the automated extraction of semantic information entities like persons, places and organizations. The technology {{presented in this article}} {{is an example of how}} corpora consisting of visually impaired analog media can be prepared for semantic search applications based on automatic content indexing - another major goal of the use case Contentus...|$|E
40|$|The author tells in his {{introductory}} {{article to}} the publication {{the history of}} the emergence of <b>hectography</b> in Russia and touches upon the related questions of describing hectograph texts from the collection of the Russian State Library devoted, among other things, to the «Encyclical» by I. G. Kabanov. At present such editions are bibliographic rarities. The publication of hectograph texts dating to the 19 th and 20 th centuries, that follows, is dedicated to the polemics between the supporters of the «Encyclical», the champions of the Old Believer I. G. Kabanov — the author of the «Encyclical Letter of 1862 » and an advocate of a rapprochement with the Russian Church, and the «non-Encyclicals», his adversaries. Kabanov’s letters reveal his views on the relations between the Russian Orthodox Church and the «Belokrinitsky Agreement» of the Old Believer Church. These texts, written after his death, present a picture of an appreciation of Kabanov’s activities on the part of various ecclesiastical, political and cultural circles of the then Russia. In them Kabanov singles out several key reasons for the ever-deepening schism between the two Churches: he notes an inﬂuence on the Old Believers exercised by a certain semi-legendary personality, Martin the Armenian, as well as previously unheard-of circulation among the Old Believers of apocryphal texts presenting a most hostile view on the Russian Church. The second of the published hectograph texts deals with a later stage of polemics between the «Encyclicals» and the leader of their adversaries, Bishop Iov (Borisov). The author of the text, priest V. Mekhannikov, conducted a most detailed analysis of Bishop John Kartushin’s literary work and singled out his principal mistakes which led to the separation of the «non-Encyclicals»...|$|E
