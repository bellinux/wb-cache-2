40|$|A {{quantitative}} analysis of retained austenite and nonmetallic inclusions in gas tungsten arc (GTA) –welded aluminum-containing transformation-induced-plasticity (TRIP) steels is presented. The amount of retained austenite in the heat-affected and fusion zones of welded aluminum-containing TRIP steel with different base metal austenite fractions has been measured by magnetic saturation measurements, {{to study the}} effect of weld thermal cycles on the stabilization of austenite.
