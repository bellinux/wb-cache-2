40|$|Vibration {{diagnosis}} {{is one of}} the most common techniques in condition evaluation of wind turbine equipped with gearbox. On the other side, gearbox {{is one of the}} key components of wind turbine drivetrain. Due to the stochastic operation of wind turbines, the gearbox shaft rotating speed changes with high percentage, which limits the application of traditional vibration signal processing techniques, such as fast Fourier transform. This paper investigates a new approach for wind turbine <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>shaft</b> gear fault diagnosis using discrete wavelet transform and time synchronous averaging. First, the vibration signals are decomposed into a series of subbands signals with the use of a multiresolution analytical property of the discrete wavelet transform. Then, 22 condition indicators are extracted from the TSA signal, residual signal, and difference signal. Through the case study analysis, a new approach reveals the most relevant condition indicators based on vibrations that can be used for <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>shaft</b> gear spalling fault diagnosis and their tracking abilities for fault degradation progression.

40|$|An {{investigation}} into the effects of transient events on the wind turbine drive train is presented. Two transient events, normal stop and emergency stop due to grid loss, are studied focusing on the effects that these individual events have on the drive train. The analysis was conducted using two commercial software packages; GH Bladed to simulate the loads on the turbine and RomaxWIND to find the resulting effects of these loads on key bearings within the drive train. Time series of the turbine and overall drive train loads during these transient events are simulated using Bladed and these are applied to a detailed drive train model to find the loads on key bearings. A comparison between the two transient events shows that emergency stops are roughly 3 times more damaging than a controlled normal stop. In addition a comparison between the results obtained from reliability analysis and results from the modeling show that the model does not predict the most damage {{to be on the}} <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>shaft</b> bearings as indicated by operational experience, rather, as might be expected from a simplified picture of the turbine, the bearings of the low speed stage are the most damaged. The results thus suggest that other effects such as misalignments are likely to be the cause of the frequent <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>shaft</b> bearing failures rather than the loads applied through the drive train...|$|E

40|$|For magnetic-bearing-supported {{high-speed}} rotating {{machines with}} significant gyroscopic effects, {{it is necessary}} to stabilize forward and backward tilt whirling modes. Instability or low damping of these modes can prevent the attainment of desired <b>shaft</b> <b>speed.</b> We show analytically that both modes can be stabilized by using cross-axis proportional gains and high- and low-pass filters in the magnetic bearing controller. Furthermore, at <b>high</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>speeds,</b> where system phase lags degrade the stability of the forward-whirl mode, a phasor advance of the control signal can partially counteract the phase lag.

40|$|To {{facilitate}} {{the design and}} production of highly efficient and reliable wind turbine drive trains, the project deals with the mathematical modelling and experimental study of drive train system dynamics. A typical drive train is considered as the subsystem of a wind turbine that transfers mechanical power from the rotor hub to the generator, and thereby {{plays an important role}} in the system dynamics and efficiency of wind turbine operation. The dynamics of wind turbines is complex and a critical area of study for the wind industry. The multidisciplinary nature of wind turbine design adds to the complexity of this task, as the subsystems of a wind turbine need to be tuned with respect to a common objective to achieve a cost effective and optimum structural performance. The current work contributes to enhanced knowledge in this field with focus on interaction between functional components and system dynamic response, faults modelling and detectability of defects in bearings in wind turbine drive trains. The overall performance of a drive train can be evaluated from different perspectives. In this thesis, the dynamics behaviour of the <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>shaft</b> drive train is evaluated by proposed objective functions referring to displacements, loads, and frequency responses. To have a better insight into wind turbine dynamics, the global sensitivity analysis (GSA) of <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>shaft</b> drive train dynamics with respect to input structural parameters is considered. The multiplicative dimension reduction method is employed to provide the mapping between the objective functions' sensitivity indices and design variables. The results of such analysis can narrow down the number of input variables for design problem and improve the computational efficiency. The proposed GSA methodology is applied for the system modelled analysis of <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>shaft</b> subsystem of a drive train. Moreover, by introducing defects in functional components and investigating sensitivity indices, detectability of faults by GSA is proved. The results show that the proposed methodology is capable of detecting damage in the functional components such as bearings in early stage before a complete failure. The application of this methodology within the detection, prediction, and prevention framework has a potential to reduce the maintenance cost for critical components. The results can also provide a better understanding and useful hints in wind turbine drive train system dynamics with respect to different structural parameters, ultimately designing more efficient drive trains...|$|E
