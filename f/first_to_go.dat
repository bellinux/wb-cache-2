5|$|As {{a result}} of their support of Truman, the Joint Chiefs became viewed as {{politically}} tainted. Senator Taft regarded Bradley in particular with suspicion, due to Bradley's focus on Europe at the expense of Asia. Taft urged Eisenhower to replace the chiefs as soon as possible. <b>First</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> was Vandenberg, who had terminal cancer and had already announced plans to retire. On 7 May 1953, Eisenhower announced that he would be replaced by General Nathan Twining. Soon after it was announced that Bradley would be replaced by Admiral Arthur W. Radford, the Commander-in-Chief of the United States Pacific Command, Collins would be succeeded by Ridgway, and Admiral William Fechteler, who had become CNO on the death of Sherman in July 1951, by Admiral Robert B. Carney.|$|E
5|$|Gorgon was the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{into action}} as she bombarded German {{artillery}} positions in Belgium {{at the end}} of July 1918. She bombarded the Snaeskerk bridge on 28 and 29 September, but produced a single near-miss. She fired at German artillery batteries again on 14 October, but had to retreat hurriedly when she was straddled by heavy German return fire and she was hit by splinters from near-misses. The next day she bombarded another bridge; the last rounds fired by a Royal Navy warship at targets in Occupied Belgium.|$|E

Before the Senators, Mardian was an effective witness in defense of his actions. The grand jury nonetheless indicted him on March 1, 1974.|$|E
25|$|In May 1965, Rascon and {{his unit}} were {{deployed}} to the Republic of Vietnam {{where he served}} as a medic for a platoon of paratroopers.

The Lions ended 2008 having lost 23 of their last 24 regular-season games, going back to the previous season, and a total of seventeen consecutive regular season losses (the NFL record is 26 by the Buccaneers, who lost the next twelve games after their winless season).|$|E
25|$|The {{biography}} of Anthony's life by Athanasius of Alexandria helped {{to spread the}} concept of Christian monasticism, particularly in Western Europe via its Latin translations. He is often erroneously considered the first Christian monk, but as his biography and other sources make clear, there were many ascetics before him. Anthony was, however, the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into the wilderness (about 270), a geographical move {{that seems to have}} contributed to his renown. Accounts of Anthony enduring supernatural temptation during his sojourn in the Eastern Desert of Egypt inspired the often-repeated subject of the temptation of St. Anthony in Western art and literature.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} minor {{modifications}} {{were carried out}} during the production life, {{but most of the}} design remained the same up until the factory closed in 1937. <b>First</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> was the four-speed gearbox, which proved unable to handle the engine's power. It was replaced by an unsynchronized three-speed gearbox, which was fitted to all subsequent Duesenbergs. Unlike almost all American manufacturers, Duesenberg did not switch to a fully synchronized gearbox in the mid-1930s, which made the Model J difficult to drive and outdated. By 1937 the chassis and gearbox were ancient compared to the competition.|$|E

The other {{connection}} to Seven Kings West Junction was goods only and survived until 19 March 1956. The whole triangular junction disappeared under expansion of Ilford carriage sheds in 1959. Goods trains operated by British Rail continued using the loop via Woodford {{as far as}} Newbury Park until 4 October 1965. A short turn-back siding was provided on the former track-bed south of Newbury Park: after goods trains were withdrawn it was used by engineers' trains until 1992.|$|E
25|$|Charlie {{intended}} all of {{his children}} to be educated in the United States. Ai-Ling, at the early age of thirteen, was the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> becoming a special student at Wesleyan College in Georgia. All three sisters attended Wesleyan, with Ching-Ling and May-Ling moving to Georgia in 1907. Ai-Ling graduated in 1909, and moved back to China. Charlie installed her as Sun Yat-Sen’s secretary, in charge of handling his correspondence and of decoding messages {{to him from the}} republicans. A few years later in 1911, Sun Yat-Sen was successful in bringing about the Xinhai Revolution, and the Qing Dynasty fell to be replaced by the short-lived presidency of Sun Yat-Sen.|$|E
25|$|Kodiak bears begin {{entering}} their dens in late October. Pregnant sows {{are usually}} the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to dens; males are the last. Males begin emerging from their dens in early April, while sows with new cubs may stay in dens until late June. Bears living on {{the north end of}} Kodiak Island tend to have longer denning periods than bears in the southern areas. Most Kodiak bears dig their dens in hill or mountain sides and they use a wide variety of denning habitats depending on which part of the archipelago they live. Almost a quarter of the adult bears forgo denning, staying somewhat active throughout the winter.|$|E
