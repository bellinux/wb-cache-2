50|$|<b>Indulines</b> are {{a series}} of dyestuffs of blue, bluish-red or black shades, formed by the {{interaction}} of para-amino azo compounds with primary monoamines {{in the presence of a}} small quantity of a mineral acid. They were first discovered in 1863 by J. Dale and Heinrich Caro, and since then have been examined by many chemists.|$|R
50|$|Aniline Yellow {{is used in}} {{microscopy}} for vital staining, in pyrotechnics for yellow colored smokes, {{in yellow}} pigments and inks including inks for inkjet printers. It is also used in insecticides, lacquers, varnishes, waxes, oil stains, and styrene resins. It is also an intermediate in synthesis of other dyes, e.g. chrysoidine, <b>indulines,</b> Solid Yellow, and Acid Yellow.|$|R
50|$|Phenazine (C12H8N2 or C6H4N2C6H4), {{also called}} azophenylene, dibenzo-p-diazine, dibenzo{{pyrazine}}, and acridizine, is a dibenzo annulated pyrazine and the parent substance of many dyestuffs, {{such as the}} toluylene red, <b>indulines</b> and safranines (and the closely related eurhodines). Phenazine crystallizes in yellow needles, which are only sparingly soluble in alcohol. Sulfuric acid dissolves it, forming a deep-red solution.|$|R
5000|$|Safranines are the azonium {{compounds}} of symmetrical 2,8-dimethyl-3,7-diamino-phenazine. They {{are obtained}} by the joint oxidation of one molecule of a para-diamine with two molecules of a primary amine; by the condensation of para-aminoazo compounds with primary amines, and {{by the action of}} para-nitrosodialkylanilines with secondary bases such as diphenylmetaphenylenediamine. They are crystalline solids showing a characteristic green metallic lustre; they are readily soluble in water and dye blue or violet. They are strong bases and form stable monacid salts. Their alcoholic solution shows a yellow-red fluorescence. Phenosafranine is not very stable in the free state; its chloride forms green plates. It can be readily diazotized, and the diazonium salt when boiled with alcohol yields aposafranine or benzene <b>induline,</b> C18H12N3. F. Kehrmann showed that aposafranine could be diazotized in the presence of cold concentrated sulfuric acid, and the diazonium salt on boiling with alcohol yielded phenylphenazonium salts. Aposafranone, C18H12N2O, is formed by heating aposafranine with concentrated hydrochloric acid. These three compounds are perhaps to be represented as ortho- or as para-quinones. The [...] "safranine" [...] of commerce is an ortho-tolusafranine. The first aniline dye-stuff to be prepared on a manufacturing scale was mauveine, which was obtained by Sir William Henry Perkin by heating crude aniline with potassium bichromate and sulfuric acid. Mauveine was converted to parasafranine (1,8-dimethyl Safranine) by Perkin in 1878 by oxidative/reductive loss of the 7-N-para-tolyl group.Another well known safranin is phenosafranine (C.I. 50200, 3,7-diamino-5-phenylphenazinium chloride)widely used as histological dye, photosensitizer and redox probe.|$|E
5000|$|They are {{derivatives}} of the eurhodines (aminophenazines, aminonaphthophenazines), and {{by means}} of their diazo derivatives can be de-amidated, yielding in this way azonium salts; consequently they may be considered as amidated azonium salts. The first reaction giving a clue to their constitution was {{the isolation of the}} intermediate azophenin by O. Witt, which was proved by Fischer and Hepp to be dianilidoquinone dianil, a similar intermediate compound being found shortly afterwards in the naphthalene series. Azophenin, C30H24N4, is prepared by warming quinone dianil with aniline; by melting together quinone, aniline and aniline hydrochloride; or by the action of aniline on para-nitrosophenol or para-nitrosodiphenylamine. The <b>indulines</b> are prepared as mentioned above from aminoazo compounds, or by condensing oxy- and amido-quinones with phenylated ortho-diamines. The <b>indulines</b> may be subdivided into the following groups: (1) benzindulines, derivatives of phenazine; (2) isorosindulines; and (3) rosindulines, both derived from naphthophenazine; and (4) naphthindulines, derived from naphthazine.|$|R
