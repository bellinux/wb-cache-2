50|$|The Ronderib Afrikaner {{is one of}} {{the larger}} breeds of South African {{indigenous}} sheep. There are two known sub varieties of this breed, one that has soft, <b>fine,</b> <b>shiny</b> <b>hair</b> being the Blinkhaar Ronderib Afrikaner, and the Steekhaar Ronderib Afrikaner having coarse hair, which was thought to be extinct. However, twenty animals were found in 1995 on a farm near Upington. The ribs of both are oval in cross section rather than flat. It is these two characteristics of coat and rib shape which distinguish this distinctive breed. Like the Namaqua Afrikaner (mentioned above) the breed is very adept to desert conditions and is remarkable for the long Seasons it can survive with little or no water. The Ronderib Afrikaners show further characteristics of desert animals in that, similar to the gemsbok, their heels are close together. The aim of the old Ronderib breeders was to develop sheep with shiny coats suitable for making of skin blankets.|$|E

The tubular flower corolla is roughly a centimeter long and white in color with purple markings in the throat. The five corolla lobes are pointed and the stamens protrude {{from within the}} throat. The bloom period is May to July.|$|R

In the UK, the campaign focused on <b>shiny</b> <b>hair.</b> During the 1960s, a television commercial of Sunsilk featured a tune composed by John Barry, “The Girl with the Sun in Her Hair”, which proved so popular that it was subsequently released as a pop single.|$|R
50|$|This {{perennial}} herb {{is just a}} few centimeters tall. It is stemless, with a caudex {{covered in}} the remains of previous seasons' leaves. The leaves are up to 8 centimeters long and are made up of several pairs of small leaflets. The flowers are yellowish or greenish white with purple tips. Blooming occurs in May and June. The fruit is an inflated legume pod covered in <b>shiny</b> <b>hairs.</b> It is up to 3 centimeters long.|$|R
5000|$|Black {{sugar is}} a form of {{crystalline}} precipitate or a particulate pollution by-product unique from creosote caused by the burning of low grade coal in the 1940-1960s. The outgas from burning coal would be a by-product (burning coal was used in residential forced hot air furnaces) for the heating of family housing. Black sugar was often found on porches and the cold ductwork and caused the high carbon, soot-loaded gas to precipitate on the floors and walls and crystallize. Outward appearance was that of very <b>fine,</b> <b>shiny</b> coal, but would not combust when exposed to flames. After a time, the crystalline material would become powdered, to the consistency of white cane sugar, but retain a <b>fine,</b> <b>shiny,</b> black texture, thus the name [...] "black sugar". The material would often be cleaned from duct work by chimney sweeps or cleaning staff on a regular basis in the Beaver-Ambridge-Monaca area of Pennsylvania along the Ohio River near Pittsburgh.|$|R

He saw her, wonderful, with the deep, shadowy eyes, and a silver sheen on her hair. And as he looked she released her hand and lifted it, with the other, to her hood. He saw the <b>shiny</b> <b>hair</b> darken and disappear--and then the lovely face with its sad eyes and tragic lips.|$|R
5000|$|The shrub {{produces}} tall inflorescences {{which are}} loose, glandular spikes of flowers. Each flower {{is one to}} two centimeters wide with five pale pink or pinkish-streaked white lobes whose external surfaces have long, <b>shiny</b> <b>hairs.</b> The three lower lobes curl outward from the mouth and under, and the two upper lobes are joined into a lip that curves forward over the mouth. Within the mouth are long stamen filaments bearing anthers, and a flat, hairless, sterile stamen called a staminode.|$|R
5000|$|Sassoon stated his {{intentions}} in designing new, more efficient, hair styles: [...] "If I {{was going to}} be in hairdressing, I wanted to change things. I wanted to eliminate the superfluous and get down to the basic angles of cut and shape." [...] Sassoon's works include the geometric perm and the [...] "Nancy Kwan" [...] hairstyles. They were all modern and low-maintenance. The hairstyles created by Sassoon relied on dark, straight, and <b>shiny</b> <b>hair</b> cut into geometric yet organic shapes.|$|R

The main symptom is pain in the affected areas, at rest and while walking (claudication). The impaired circulation increases sensitivity to cold. Peripheral pulses are diminished or absent. There are color changes in the extremities. The colour may range from cyanotic blue to reddish blue. Skin becomes thin and <b>shiny.</b> <b>Hair</b> growth is reduced. Ulcerations and gangrene in the extremities are common complications, often resulting in the need for amputation of the involved extremity.|$|R

Its unique cause of visual culture are widely used in advertising to convey messages in various products of goods and services, so ads become an alternative to transmit the new culture to the public. Similarly, the ad "Clear Soft and <b>Shiny</b> <b>Hair</b> Model" which uses images that have meanings connected with the cultural and social reality. Ad "Clear Soft and <b>Shiny</b> <b>Hair</b> Model" is interesting to study, because in addition to using different models in magazines and billboards Chic, it represents beauty and femininity in using Indonesian women or just use the local women. Advertising research is different from previous research that uses ads with female models indo. In addition, the layout and makeup strategies Chic magazine and billboard media are very different, {{including the use of}} models. This research focuses on analyzing the visual image itself with a knife of semiotic analysis of Roland Barthes. How to analyze the composition lies in the visual image, the aspect of culture that is closely related to people's lives. Semiotics is used to discover aspects of the model denotation and connotation of a description of the culture and local wisdom related to beauty, and femininity. Signal analysis is used to describe the beauty and femininity, as well as strategies used in Chic magazine and billboard media...|$|R
50|$|They {{dedicate}} {{themselves to}} livestock, fishing and hunting. They still use weapons like {{bows and arrows}} and spears or fish nets. Men wear shirts of manta-sucia, while women dress similar to the Ngobes. They wear necklaces, facial paint of black and red, and <b>shiny</b> <b>hair</b> combs. They make hats of vegetable fibers, backpacks, baskets, and daily dresses called cobo. They live in round houses on stilts. They are monogamous, and the Bokotas have often intermarried with the Ngöbe Buglés. There are still fullblood families of Bokota. Many traditional ceremonies are maintained, including the ceremony of lightning, that prevents lightning from striking their houses.|$|R

50|$|Research into {{evolution}} {{explains the}} use of sex in advertising and the differences between genders, due to different mating strategies. It is the biological prerogative of the male to reproduce with as many females as possible, as this increases his chances of producing offspring. Because of this need to reproduce as much as possible, males search for cues which signal females are available and accessible, such as seductive behaviour, as well as cues that indicate good health, including facial symmetry, <b>shiny</b> <b>hair</b> and firm breasts. Advertisers can use these findings to help create an association between their product and the males needs by pairing the two.|$|R
