40|$|Abstract. Experimental data {{reveal that}} dry filters {{utilizing}} filter papers tend {{to change their}} operational characteristics whilst in service. When the airflow stream in the filter is constant, the pressure losses, and hence energy losses, will increase. On the other hand, when a constant pressure head is maintained to induce the flow, the flow rate of the flowing medium will decrease. A possible solution is a filter made from several <b>filtering</b> <b>layers,</b> their density varying along the dusted air flow path. Basing on the theory of filtration, the density of <b>filter</b> <b>layers</b> shall be chosen such {{that the amount of}} particulate matter settling on individual <b>filter</b> <b>layers</b> should be identical. The paper summaries the results of experimental testing of five-layered filters. Of particular interest is the distribution of collected dust mass along the airflow path in the filter in relation to the layer density...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{filtration}} removal efficiency falls with an increase in flow rate; however, there is limited supporting experimental data on how removal efficiency changes for <b>filters</b> with multiple <b>layers</b> of media and for wastewater filtration, a practice that is becoming more common. Furthermore, information is not available on the characteristics of particles that are removed at different flow rates. Here, a quadruple media filter was operated at hydraulic loading rates (HLRs) between 5 and 60 mh− 1 with subsequent measurement of total suspended solids, turbidity and particle size distribution (PSD). Samples were collected from the filter influent, effluent and also from between media layers. Pressure changes across the <b>filter</b> <b>layers</b> were also measured. The solids removal efficiency of the filter varied inversely with the increase in filtration rate. However, the multiple media layers reduced the negative impact of increased HLR in comparison to a single media filter. High filtration rates were shown to transport solids, such that particle retention and headloss development was distributed across the entire depth of the multi-media filter. There was also a progressive decrease in the suspension particle size leaving each of the <b>filter</b> <b>layers.</b> The particle hydrodynamic force simulation was consistent with the changes in measured PSD through the <b>filter</b> <b>layers...</b>|$|R

50|$|C-41 film {{consists}} of an acetate or polyester film base, onto which multiple emulsions are coated. Each layer is only sensitive to a certain color of visible light. In the classic illustrative example, there are three emulsions: one is red sensitive, another is green sensitive, and the top is blue-sensitive. Beneath the blue layer is a yellow filter, composed of dyes or colloidal silver. All silver-based photographic emulsions have some sensitivity to blue light, regardless of what other colors they may be sensitized for.

40|$|Abstract. To {{replace the}} color filter in the {{conventional}} display, we describe a color-separation backlight consisting of three modules: the light collimation module, the light guide and the micro-lens array. With angularly positioned color LEDs, the displaying method requires only two two-color <b>filter</b> <b>layers</b> to display color images. In the light collimation module, the angular rays of two colors from each LED are collimated by a reflective cup and a collimation lens. After entering the light guide, which is composed of V-groove structures at the bottom above a reflective layer, the angular collimated color beams are redirected to the normal of the top surface of light guide. Finally, the output rays are converged by a micro-lens array and mapped into corresponding sub-pixel positions for efficiently displaying color image. The three main advantages of such technology are {{the reduction of the}} dye color <b>filter</b> <b>layers</b> from conventional 3 to 2, the gain factor of transmission efficiency two times more than that of conventional color filters, and the larger color gamut...|$|R

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 103 - 115. The {{absorption edge}} of AlGaN based alloys can be tuned from deep UV to near UV {{by changing the}} composition. This {{enables the use of}} the material in various technological applications such as military, environmental monitoring and biological imaging. In this thesis, we proposed and demonstrated various UV photodetectors for different purposes. The multi-band photodetectors have the unique ability to sense the UV spectrum in different portions at the same time. We demonstrated monolithically integrated dual and four-band photodetectors with multi layer structures grown on sapphire. This was achieved through epitaxial growth of multi AlGaN layers with decreasing Al content. We suggested two different device architectures. First one has separate <b>filter</b> and active <b>layers,</b> whereas the second one has all active layers which are used as <b>filter</b> <b>layers</b> as well. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) values for the dual band photodetector was 11 and 22 nm with more than three orders of magnitude inter-band rejection ratio. The self-filtering four band photodetector has FWHMs of 18, 17, 22 and 9 nm from longer to shorter bands. Whereas photodetector with separate <b>filter</b> <b>layers</b> has FWHMs of 8, 12, 11 and 8 nm, from longer to shorter bands.

5000|$|Louis Ducos du Hauron had {{suggested}} using a sandwich of three differently color-recording emulsions on transparent supports {{which could be}} exposed together in an ordinary camera, then taken apart and used like any other set of three-color separations. The problem was that although two of the emulsions could be in contact face-to-face, the third {{would have to be}} separated by the thickness of one transparent support layer. Because all silver halide emulsions are inherently sensitive to blue, the blue-recording layer ought to be on top and have a blue-blocking yellow <b>filter</b> <b>layer</b> behind it. This blue-recording layer, used to make the yellow print which could most afford to be [...] "soft," [...] would end up producing the sharpest image. The two layers behind it, one sensitized to red but not green and the other to green but not red, would suffer from scattering of the light as it passed through the topmost emulsion, and one or both would further suffer by being spaced away from it.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{ordinary}} black-and-white plates, the Autochrome {{was loaded}} into the camera with the bare glass side facing the lens, so that the light passed through the mosaic <b>filter</b> <b>layer</b> before reaching the emulsion. The use of an additional special orange-yellow filter in the camera was required to block ultraviolet light and restrain the effects of violet and blue light, parts of the spectrum to which the emulsion was overly sensitive. Because of the light loss due to all the filtering, Autochrome plates required much longer exposures than black-and-white plates and films, which meant that a tripod or other stand had to be used {{and that it was}} not practical to photograph moving subjects. The plate was reversal-processed into a positive transparency — that is, the plate was first developed into a negative image but not [...] "fixed", then the silver forming the negative image was chemically removed, then the remaining silver halide was exposed to light and developed, producing a positive image.|$|E

50|$|Color {{films have}} {{multiple}} layers of silver halide emulsion to separately record the red, green and blue thirds of the spectrum. For every silver halide grain there is a matching color coupler grain (except Kodachrome film, to which color couplers were added during processing).

Just as in black-and-white, {{the first step in}} color development converts exposed silver halide grains into metallic silver - except that an equal amount of color dye will be formed as well. The color couplers in the blue-sensitive layer will form yellow dye during processing, the green layer will form magenta dye and the red layer will form cyan dye. A bleach step will convert the metallic silver back into silver halide, which is then removed along with the unexposed silver halide in the fixer and wash steps, leaving only color dyes.|$|E

It is not advised to use the filters, as the case is made with a percentage of lead which slowly degrades into the filter, along with many other chemicals used in the manufacturing process. Furthermore, the GP-5 mask is known to tightly cling to the skin of the head, making it only wearable by having relatively short hair.|$|E
5000|$|The first Kodak {{product called}} Kodachrome {{was invented by}} John Capstaff in 1913. His Kodachrome was a {{subtractive}} process that used only two colors: blue-green and red-orange. It required two glass plate negatives, one made using a panchromatic emulsion and a red filter, the other made using an emulsion insensitive to red light. The two plates could be exposed as a [...] "bipack" [...] (sandwiched emulsion to emulsion, with a very thin red <b>filter</b> <b>layer</b> between), which eliminated the need for multiple exposures or a special color camera. After development, the silver images were bleached out with chemistry that hardened the bleached portions of the gelatin. Using dyes which were absorbed only by the unhardened gelatin, the negative that recorded the blue and green light was dyed red-orange and the red-exposed negative was dyed blue-green. The result {{was a pair of}} positive dye images. The plates were then assembled emulsion to emulsion, producing a transparency that was capable of surprisingly good (for a two-color process) color rendition of skin tones in portraits. Capstaff's Kodachrome was made commercially available in 1915. It was also adapted for use as a 35 mm motion picture film process.Today, this first version of Kodachrome is nearly forgotten, completely overshadowed by the next Kodak product bearing the name Kodachrome.|$|E
