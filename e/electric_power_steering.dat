25|$|Redesigned <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>steering.</b>|$|E
25|$|For 2004, Saturn also re-calibrated the <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>steering,</b> {{as well as}} {{upgraded}} interior materials, {{and offered}} new sound systems.|$|E
25|$|The second {{generation}} Punto has also adopted the Dualdrive <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> and came with two operation modes, using an electric motor, {{rather than a}} hydraulic pump driven by the engine.|$|E
50|$|Other {{features}} include <b>electric</b> motor-based <b>power</b> <b>steering,</b> revised aerodynamics, low-rolling resistance 225/45R17 tyres, and electric actuation {{of the rear}} brakes.|$|R
50|$|The Stilo was {{the second}} car {{worldwide}} to use the TRW Column-Drive <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Assisted <b>Steering</b> (EPS) technology after the Fiat Punto MK2, later introduced on the 2003 Nissan Micra and Renault MÃ©gane.|$|R
50|$|All models come {{standard}} with enhanced Vehicle Stability Control which immediately alters <b>electric</b> <b>powering</b> <b>steering</b> assist w/traction control (hybrids come standard with VDIM), anti-lock brakes, brake assist {{and electronic}} brakeforce distribution. Also standard is a tire pressure monitor, a driver's knee airbag, front seat-mounted side torso airbags, side curtain airbags {{for all three}} rows which includes a rollover sensor and active front headrests. Hill Start Assist Control (HAC) is also standard which prevents rolling backwards on slopes, and Downhill Assist Control (DAC) is standard on AWD trims.|$|R
25|$|The F30 is {{the first}} {{generation}} of 3 Series to be powered by a range of turbocharged engines exclusively and <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> (replacing the hydraulic power steering systems used previously). The F30 also marked the 3 Series' first use of a three-cylinder engine in its 2015 facelift. A new plug-in hybrid F30 model was also introduced in 2016.|$|E
25|$|Other, non-powertrain related {{upgrades}} {{made to the}} 2011 Mustang {{included a}} Nexteer Automotive <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Steering</b> (EPS) system with pull-drift compensation and active nibble control, general aerodynamic and NVH improvements over the 2010 Mustang, a digital message/information center, blind spot mirrors integrated into the car's side mirrors, a universal garage door opener, a 160mph speedometer, and Ford's MyKey programmable vehicle key technology.|$|E
25|$|New to the GS {{line was}} an <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> (EPS) system, {{and both the}} V8 and hybrid models {{featured}} a variable gear ratio steering (VGRS) system and Electronically Controlled Brake (ECB) a type of brake-by-wire system. V8 and hybrid models also featured an adaptive suspension system that individually altered suspension damper firmness. Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM) was standard on the GS 430, 460, and 450h models and coupled to VGRS, with which it could alter steering gear ratios.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{replacement}} of S 320 CDI with improved fuel efficiency. Changes include: on-demand <b>electric</b> hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> pump, standstill decoupling for the 7G-TRONIC automatic transmission, and 17-inch light-alloy wheels with reduced rolling resistance tyres.|$|R
5000|$|In February 1969, Opel three- and four-speed {{transmissions}} (three-speed standard, others optional); Powerglide {{were added}} (now four transmissions); mechanical fuel pump replaced by in-tank <b>electric</b> pump; <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> option; base [...] "11" [...] style notchback trim upgraded to match hatchback and wagon carpet and headliner.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} trim levels {{available}} Standard, Comfortable and Luxury. Both Comfortable and Luxury include air conditioning, alloy wheels, ABS, EBD, CD/MP3 player, <b>electric</b> windows, <b>power</b> <b>steering,</b> trip computer, rear reverse radar and central locking. The Luxury model includes front three-point seat belts with emergency locking retractor (ELR).|$|R
25|$|The third-generation RX's new {{transmission}} can lock-up its torque converter from 2nd through 6th gears to improve fuel economy. By dropping the center locking differential, a new Active Torque Control all-wheel drive system diverts anywhere from 50% {{or up to}} 100% power to the front wheels for reduced drivetrain associated efficiency losses which in turn increases fuel efficiency. An <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Steering</b> (EPS) system replaces the previous belt-driven hydraulic pump. A double wishbone rear suspension setup replaces the previous MacPherson strut design for improved handling and greater cargo space, while an optional Sports Package adds a performance-tuned suspension.|$|E
25|$|When the sonar park sensors {{feature is}} used, the processor(s) {{calculate}} steering angle data which are {{displayed on the}} navigation/camera touchscreen along with obstacle information. The Intelligent Parking Assist System expands on this capability and is accessible when the vehicle is shifted to reverse (which automatically activates the backup camera). When in reverse, the backup camera screen features parking buttons {{which can be used}} to activate automated parking procedures. When the Intelligent Parking Assist System is activated, the central processor calculates the optimum parallel or reverse park steering angles and then interfaces with the <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Steering</b> systems of the vehicle to guide the car into the parking spot.|$|E
25|$|Also {{new to the}} GS {{line was}} an <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Steering</b> (EPS) system {{replacing}} the previous model's hydraulic steering pump, while the V8 model featured a Variable Gear Ratio Steering (VGRS) system and Electronically Controlled Brake (ECB) a type of brake-by-wire system. In August 2005, the GS 430 was the first car by Toyota with Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS). AVS monitors and adjusts the shock-absorber settings at each wheel, depending on the conditions. On rough roads, for example, damping is reduced for a more comfortable ride. And, while cornering, the suspension is tightened to help reduce body lean and provide even greater responsiveness. Using the EPS system the GS can automatically compensate for crosswinds.|$|E
50|$|The Interceptor {{may have}} taken some styling cues from the Brasinca Uirapuru, with a {{distinctive}} large, curving wrap-around rear window that doubled as a tailgate. The original specification included electric windows, reclining front seats, a wood rimmed steering wheel, radio with twin speakers, reversing lights and an <b>electric</b> clock. <b>Power</b> <b>steering</b> was included as standard from September 1968.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Electric</b> {{hydraulic}} <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> system (EHPS) is an on-demand <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> {{system that}} uses a small displacement and high speed electric pump. By optimizing the assist characteristic curve, EHPS can save energy more significantly than traditional hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> system. After overview of the energy saving principle for EHPS system, the energy consumption of the EHPS system is elaborated, and the energy loss of the mechanical, electrical, hydraulic subsystems is analyzed. Finally, targeted measures are proposed for energy conservation...|$|R
50|$|Standard {{features}} included six airbags, isofix attachments, {{automatic door}} locks, fire prevention system (fuel cut off), ABS braking with brake force distribution, an anti-slip regulation system to limit wheel slip {{in cases of}} reduced grip, traction control, electronic stability control, hill-holder, <b>electric</b> speed-sensitive <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> system, 40-20-40 split rear seating, and a headlight delay system marketed as Follow Me Home.|$|R
25|$|The EV1 was {{not only}} used to {{showcase}} the electric powertrain, but also premiered a number of features and technologies that would later find their way onto more common GM models and other manufacturers' cars. The EV1 {{was among the first}} production vehicles to utilize aluminum {{in the construction of the}} frame. The car's body panels were made of plastic rather than metal, making the car lightweight and dent resistant. The vehicle was fitted with Anti-lock brakes and a traction control system. Comfort improvements included a keyless entry and ignition system, a special one-way thermal glass for better heat rejection on sunny days, an automated tire pressure loss warning system, <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>steering,</b> and a time-programmable HVAC system.|$|E
25|$|The third {{generation}} Lexus GS came standard with dual front airbags, front driver and passenger knee airbags, {{front and rear}} row side curtain airbags, and front row side torso airbags standard while rear row side torso airbags were optional. An Adaptive Front-lighting System (AFS) was standard on the V8 model while optional on the V6 model. The radar-based Pre-Collision System (PCS) with a Dynamic Radar Cruise Control system was optional. PCS can automatically apply up to 0.3g of deceleration if the driver does not react to imminent crash warnings. Anti-lock braking, electronic brakeforce distribution, brake assist and Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) are standard on all models. VSC with the <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> system can immediately alter steering torque assist during evasive maneuvers.|$|E
25|$|For the 2014 model year, {{changes to}} GS 350 {{includes}} eight-speed automatic transmission with steering for rear-wheel drive (RWD) model, introduction of F SPORT package (optional Lexus Dynamic Handling system with dynamic rear steering (DRS), <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>steering,</b> variable gear ratio steering (VGRS)), integrated Siri Eyes Free mode from Apple (compatible with iPhone 4S and newer), flush mounted sensors for available intuitive park assist, full color display {{added to the}} optional head-up display, available blind spot monitor adds rear cross traffic alert and power-folding mirrors, Luxury Package changes (LED foglamps, Superchrome finish for 18-inch wheels, and the rear armrest control panel display adds display option to view radio station and song title information), optional power trunk opener, Lexus Night View system discontinued.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{switched}} reluctance motors (SRM) {{are proposed}} {{as an alternative}} for <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> assisted <b>steering</b> (EPAS) applications. A prototype machine has been developed as very attractive design for a steering electric motor, both from a cost and size perspective. A fourphase 8 / 6 SRM drive is designed for a rack type EPAS which should provide a maximum force of 10 kN. Two-dimension finite element analysis is used to validate the design...|$|R
50|$|Ian Callum was the {{exterior}} designer for the F-Pace. The body structure comprises 80 per cent aluminium, and additional weight savings {{come from the}} composite tailgate and magnesium for parts such as the cross-car beam. The body's high torsional stiffness enables the F-TYPE-derived {{double wishbone front suspension}} and sophisticated Integral Link rear suspension to perform even better. Together with Torque Vectoring as standard and an <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Assisted <b>Steering</b> system tuned to give the best possible feel and response.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{switched}} reluctance motors (SRM) {{are proposed}} {{as an alternative}} for <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> assisted <b>steering</b> (EPAS) applications. The new 42 V power voltage system is a very attractive design for a steering electric motor, both from a cost and size perspective.

25|$|In March, {{three models}} with the world's first <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> (CGPF/CGPL/CGPJ) {{were added to}} the lineup, at a juicy Â¥150,000 surcharge. Actress and pop idol Yuka Ånishi (å¤§è¥¿çµè±) was the {{spokesperson}} for the ad campaign, while an all female motorcycle racing team (Team Angela) raced a Turbocharged Cervo in the Safari Rally. However, it was all to no avail: The rivals, Daihatsu's new Leeza and Mazda's Autozam Carol both sold much better. Combined with the removal of certain tax breaks for small cargo vehicles, this meant that the Cervo's already narrow slot in the market had essentially disappeared. When the new 660cc Kei regulations were introduced, Suzuki decided to call it quits rather than {{spend a lot of money}} to update such a slow-selling vehicle and Cervo production ended in May 1990.|$|E
2500|$|The Prius uses an all-electric A/C {{compressor}} for cooling, {{an industry}} first, and also adds an <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> system to further minimize engine belt-driven engine accessories. Combined {{with a smaller}} and lighter NiMH battery, the XW20 is more powerful and more efficient than the XW11. [...] In the U.S., the battery pack of the 2004 Prius is warranted for [...] or 8 years. The warranty for hybrid components in California and the seven Northeastern states that have adopted the stricter California emission control standards is [...] or 10 years.|$|E
2500|$|An <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> rack with a 14.3:1 {{gear ratio}} is used. The front {{suspension}} utilizes a double-wishbone arrangement {{and there is}} a multi-link arrangement at the rear with coil-over dampers at all wheels. The dampers are a monotube design, each with a remote fluid reservoir that includes an expanding and contracting bellows: a purely mechanical system. The LFA further features six-piston front and four-piston rear Brembo monobloc brake calipers with [...] front and [...] rear carbon ceramic discs controlled by Toyota's Electronically Controlled Brake brake-by-wire system. Forged 20-inch BBS wheels fitted with [...] front and [...] rear Bridgestone next-generation Potenza tires are standard. The LFA is equipped with a three-mode Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM) stability control system with Sport setting.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Electric</b> windows, <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> and {{power-assisted}} brakes were standard. Options included air conditioning, a luggage rack, uprated Koni shock absorbers, {{floor mats}} and Lucas Square Eight fog lamps, {{and a range}} of aftermarket products, most of which were dealer installed as optional accessories could also be fitted. Rather unusually for a 4-seat touring car, the accessory list included a sump protector plate that was never produced. This was probably included as a slightly [...] "gimmicky" [...] tribute to Triumph's rallying successes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: With the {{development}} of mechatronics technology in the transporter industry, the <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> assisted <b>steering</b> (EPAS) system has many advantages compared to the hydraulic system. Many manufacturers are developing and applying EPAS systems to improve {{the performance of the}} transporter. Using the HILS system developed in the paper, an adaptable EPAS system was developed for real transporter. It was installed in a real, KIA Rio, and tested. Results indicated outstanding performance. Therefore, the developed EPAS can be applied via HILS system...|$|R
25|$|Ford also {{improved}} {{upon the}} handling {{characteristics of the}} GT500. The overall stance of the car has been lowered by 11 millimeters in front and 8 millimeters at the rear. The car also features Ford's new <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Assist <b>Steering</b> (EPAS) that improves torque build-up and road feel which delivers quicker and more precise steering, increased effort on the racetrack or winding roads, and reduced effort in low-speed parking maneuvers. The car also has Ford's AdvanceTrac stability control system, which features a sport mode when pressed twice consecutively while stopped with the brakes applied.|$|R
2500|$|The NHW11 Prius {{became more}} {{powerful}} partly {{to satisfy the}} higher speeds and longer distances that Americans drive. Air conditioning and <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> were standard equipment. While the larger Prius could seat five, its battery pack restricted cargo space. The Prius was offered in US in three trim packages: Standard, Base and Touring. The US EPA (CARB) classified the car with an air pollution score of 3 out of 10 as an Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV). Prius owners were eligible {{for up to a}} [...] federal tax deduction from their gross income. Toyota executives stated that with the Prius NHW10 model, the company had been losing money on each Prius sold, and with the NHW11 it was now breaking even.|$|E
2500|$|In 1951, Ovshinsky {{accepted}} {{an offer to}} move to Detroit {{and work in the}} automotive industry as the {{director of research at the}} Hupp Motor Company. Continuing his work on intelligent machines, he invented <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>steering,</b> but Hupp's president was opposed to completing the arrangements with General Motors to utilize the product. Not long after that, Stan and his younger brother Herb Ovshinsky, a talented mechanical engineer, established a small company called General Automation in a Detroit storefront. [...] There, Stan continued his study of intelligent machines and embarked on early research and development of various energy and information technologies. At the same time, he began studying neurophysiology and neurological diseases. [...] On the basis of his early writings about nerve impulses and the nature of intelligence, he was invited by Wayne Medical School in June 1955 to participate in pioneering experimental research on the mammalian cerebellum.|$|E
2500|$|The SH-AWD model also {{includes}} some interior refinements over the base model and is tuned for slightly firmer suspension and steering feedback. It is visually distinguishable {{from the base}} model on the exterior by its SH-AWD badge on the trunk, quad exhaust pipes (as opposed to dual exhaust on the base model) and larger air ducts in the front bumper to cool the larger brakes (the base model's turn signal indicators in the bumper extend {{all the way to}} the center.) The TL rides on 245/50R17 tires, while the TL SH-AWD has 245/45R18 tires with optional 245/40ZR19 summer performance tires. Both models use <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> rather than hydraulic, and a revised five-speed automatic transmission featuring shift paddles on the steering wheel is standard equipment for both models. [...] Acura has announced that a manual transmission will be offered in the 2010 SH-AWD model.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>power</b> {{assisted}} <b>steering</b> (EPS/EPAS) or motor-driven <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> (MDPS) uses {{an electric}} motor to assist the driver of a vehicle. Sensors detect the position and torque of the steering column, and a computer module applies assistive torque via the motor, which connects to either the steering gear or steering column. This allows varying amounts of assistance to be applied depending on driving conditions. Engineers can therefore tailor steering-gear response to variable-rate and variable-damping suspension systems, optimizing ride, handling, and steering for each vehicle. On Fiat group cars the amount of assistance can be regulated using a button named [...] "CITY" [...] that switches between two different assist curves, while most other EPS systems have variable assist. These give more assistance as the vehicle slows down, and less at faster speeds.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{introduction}} of <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Assisted <b>Steering</b> (EPAS) system is gradually replacing the conventional steering system in modern cars. The main advantage of EPAS {{system is the}} ability to minimise energy consumption. This paper discusses the implementation of GA-PID algorithm to realise the potential of energy reduction as compared to conventional PID method. A brushes DC motor is mounted on the steering column to provide an assist torque to the driver. This configuration is known as C-type EPAS system. The results have shown GA-PID controller is bale to minimize energy consumption as compared to PID controller...|$|R
50|$|The {{reworked}} interior includes {{new materials}} for the door, console and dash panels, a new steering wheel and seats, and {{a wide range of}} trim packages with both leather and cloth seating. The refreshed interior also features a new instrument cluster featuring a 7-inch (180mm) TFT (Thin Film Transistor) display. The available 8.4 inch UConnect touchscreen radio with available navigation has been revised, now including UConnect Apps. Mechanically, the 3.6L Pentastar V6 and the 5.7L/6.4L HEMI engines remained the same. All engines are now backed by the ZF 8HP 8-Speed Automatic transmissions co-produced by ZF (previously only V6 models used the ZF 8-speed). There have been revisions to the chassis components, including <b>Electric</b> Assist <b>Power</b> <b>Steering,</b> which replaces the previous models Electro-Hydraulic Assist <b>Power</b> <b>Steering.</b> New aluminum rear differentials now use 4 mounting bolts for rigidity. AWD is no longer available on 5.7L R/T models.|$|R
