40|$|The {{representation}} and manipulation of <b>finite</b> <b>rotations</b> and the modelling of flexible bodies {{are at the}} heart of flexible multi-body systems dynamics simulations. When dealing with finite element formulations, the interpolation of finite-rotation fields becomes a critical issue. Objectivity, i. e. the invariance of interpolated strain fields to the addition of a rigid body motion, has been an important problem. Furthermore, the manipulation of <b>finite</b> <b>rotations</b> and the unavoidable associated singularities must be dealt in a rational manner. The various approaches to these two problems are reviewed in this article. Simple algorithms that achieve objectivity are proposed. Furthermore, these algorithms can deal with <b>finite</b> <b>rotations</b> of arbitrary large magnitude through a simple rescaling operation. The choice of unknowns, total versus incremental, is also discussed as it affects the performance of the computational process.

40|$|We {{confirm that}} a Malvinas Plate is {{required}} in the Agulhas Basin during the Late Cretaceous because: (1) oblique Mercator plots of marine gravity show that fracture zones generated on the Agulhas rift, {{as well as the}} Agulhas Fracture Zone, do not lie on small circles about the 33 o- 28 y South America-Africa stage pole and were therefore not formed by South America-Africa spreading, (2) the 33 o- 28 y South America-Africa stage rotation does not bring 33 o magnetic anomalies on the Malvinas Plate into alignment with their conjugates on the African Plate, and (3) errors in the 33 o- 28 y South America-Africa stage rotation cannot account for the misalignment. We present improved Malvinas-Africa <b>finite</b> <b>rotations</b> determined by interpreting magnetic anomaly data in light of fracture zones and extinct spreading rift segments (the Agulhas rift) that are clearly revealed in satellite-derived marine gravity fields covering the Agulhas Basin.

40|$|With {{the present}} work {{different}} finite element formulations for {{the calculation of}} shells with arbitrary intersections under consideration of <b>finite</b> <b>rotations</b> are presented and compared with each other. For the description of <b>finite</b> <b>rotations</b> the Rodrigues rotation vector is used, which allows a consistent coupling of the rotational degrees of freedom at a shell intersection of arbitrary shell geometries. The Rodrigues rotation vector was introduced by Simo and Vu-Quoc. The proposed formulation does not need any artifical stiffness parameter or penalty factor. But a distinction {{has to be made}} between element nodes which are lying in an intersection and nodes which are lying in a smooth shell area. Furthermore a mixed finite element formulation based on the principle of Hellinger-Reissner is introduced. In contrast to well known element formulations the presented finite element allows a consistent formulation of the bending, membran and shear part of the shell. (orig.)

40|$|Flexible beam {{structures}} are popular in civil and mechanical engineering. Many of these structures undergo large displacements and <b>finite</b> <b>rotations,</b> but with small deformations. Their dynamic behaviors are usually investigated using finite beam elements. A well known method to derive such beam elements is the corotational approach. This method {{has been extensively}} used in nonlinear static analysis. However, its application in nonlinear dynamics is rather limited. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the nonlinear dynamic behavior of flexible beam structures using the corotational method. For the 2 D case, a new dynamic corotational beam formulation is presented. The idea is to adopt the same corotational kinetic description in static and dynamic parts. The main novelty is to use cubic interpolations to derive both inertia terms and internal terms in order to capture correctly all inertia effects. This new formulation is compared with two classic formulations using constant Timoshenko and constant lumped mass matrices. This work {{is presented in the}} first appended journal paper. For the 3 D case, update procedures of <b>finite</b> <b>rotations,</b> which are central issues in development of nonlinear beam elements in dynamic analysis, are discussed. Three classic and one new formulations of beam elements based on the three different parameterizations of the <b>finite</b> <b>rotations</b> are presented. In these formulations, the corotational method is used to develop expressions of the internal forces and the tangent stiffness matrices, while the dynamic terms are formulated into a total Lagrangian context. Many aspects of the four formulations are investigated. First, theoretical derivations as well as practical implementations are given in details. The similarities and differences between the formulations are pointed out. Second, numerical accuracy and computational efficiency of these four formulations are compared. Regarding efficiency, the choice of the predictor at each time step and the possibility to simplify the tangent inertia matrix are carefully investigated. This work is presented in the second appended journal paper. To make this thesis self-contained, two chapters concerning the parametrization of the <b>finite</b> <b>rotations</b> and the derivation of the 3 D corotational beam element in statics are added.

40|$|An {{approach}} to a shape optimization of elastic dynamic multibody systems is presented. The proposed method combines an appropriate shape parameterization concept and recently introduced finite element type using absolute nodal coordinate formulation (ANCF).

The optimization problem is formulated as a nonlinear programming problem and a gradient-based optimization procedure is implemented. The introduced optimization design variables are related to the cross-sectional parameters of the element and to the shape of the whole structure. The shape parameterization is based on the design element techniqueand a rational B ezier body is used as a design element. A body-like design element makes possible to unify the shape optimization of both simple beams and beam-like (skeletal) structures...|$|R

Exact intrinsic virtual strain-displacement relations are derived; using a reduced 2 -D strain energy function from which the warping has been systematically eliminated, a set of intrinsic equilibrium equations follows. It is demonstrated that only five equilibrium equations can be derived in this way, because the component of virtual rotation about the normal is not independent.

40|$|AbstractImplicit Newmark {{schemes for}} {{integration}} of <b>finite</b> <b>rotations</b> in structural and continuum mechanics typically are {{more complicated than}} those used for translational motion. Using Euler’s representation of the rotation tensor Λ {{in terms of a}} rotation vector ϕ, numerical integration connecting the values {ϕn,Λn} and {ϕn+ 1,Λn+ 1 } {{at the beginning and end}} of the time step is expressed in terms of an incremental rotation vector θ and the associated incremental rotation tensor Λ(θ). Here, it is shown using backward differentiation that neglecting third order terms in θ, the approximation for the angular velocity ω in terms of θ and its time derivative has the same form as that between velocity and displacement. Consequently, the simplified Newmark scheme in terms of {θ,ω,ω̇} has the same form as that for updating translations. Details of the Newmark scheme and an analytical expression for the tangent stiffness tensor for the associated Newton–Raphson iteration procedure have been presented for rigid body dynamics. The resulting integration scheme has been tested on a nontrivial problem of three-dimensional motion of a rigid body using a constant time step. The results justify the use of the simplified Newmark scheme for <b>finite</b> <b>rotations...</b>|$|R
