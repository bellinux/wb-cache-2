50|$|Flannelgraph (also called <b>flannel</b> <b>board</b> or flannelgram) is a {{storytelling}} {{system that}} uses a board covered with flannel fabric, usually resting on an easel. It {{is very similar to}} Fuzzy Felt, although its primary use is as a storytelling medium, rather than as a toy.|$|E
50|$|The <b>flannel</b> <b>board</b> {{is usually}} painted to depict a {{background}} scene {{appropriate to the}} story being told. Paper cutouts of characters and objects in the story are then placed on the board, and moved around, as the story unfolds. These cutouts are backed, either with flannel, or with some other substance that adheres lightly to the flannel background, such as coarse sandpaper.|$|E
50|$|Plain, undecorated <b>flannel</b> <b>boards</b> {{can also}} be used as a visual aid during presentations, {{allowing}} the speaker to display and remove charts and graphs as needed.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1966 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{discover}} what the present trends, practices and beliefs of home economics educators were concerning the teaching of the undergraduate special home economics methods courses. In order to accomplish this purpose it was believed desirable to discover what was being done and what home economics educators believed should be done in these courses if there were no limiting factors. The following were the five areas of concern. 1. What facilities and equipment were available to teachers and students in the special methods courses. 2. What assignments were required in the special methods courses. 3. What content was included in the special methods courses. 4. What instructional materials were used and taught to students in the special methods courses. 5. What methods were used and taught to students in the special methods courses. To obtain the information that this study was based on, a survey questionnaire was constructed, validated and sent to the head of the home economics department in 210 colleges or universities in the United States. The 111 that were returned in usable form were divided into five groups on the basis of the division of the academic year and the number of special methods courses offered. The results obtained from the analysis of these data indicated, in most instances, what the present practices and beliefs of home economics educators were but the responses to the trends and beliefs of these educators regarding what they thought should be done if there were no limiting factors was poor, so any statements concerning trends had to be of a general nature. The facilities and equipment which were available a majority of the time to the home economics education teachers and students included projectors, resource materials and subject-matter files, and the seminar-library room. The respondents desired more access to the instructional materials center, multipurpose laboratory, seminar-library room and the opaque and overhead projectors. A similar group of assignments were believed desirable and were required by the 111 respondents. These included the development of plans, evaluative and illustrative materials and the study of guides, journals, resource materials, textbooks and topics of special interest to the students. Content believed desirable and included by the teacher educators were similar. This content included philosophy, trends, curriculum, evaluation, understanding and working with students, management of and interpreting the department, teaching of special areas and professional obligations. The instructional materials the respondents used and taught students to use included bulletin boards, charts, chalk boards, exhibits, films and filmstrips, <b>flannel</b> <b>boards</b> and posters. The home economics educators believed it was desirable to use the opaque and overhead projectors, photographs and tape recorders more than they were at the time of this study. The methods used by teacher educators which they also taught students to use included development of concepts and generalizations, cooperative planning, discussion methods, demonstrations, evaluation and grading, family centered teaching, field trips, laboratory, lecture, problem solving, reports and role playing. In addition to these, the students were taught to use case studies, home and extended experiences, home visits, sociograms and supervised study. Also included in the methods used by teachers and students were taught to use was learning experiences to develop an understanding of how to develop creativity. It appeared desirable to use some methods more than they were used at the time of this study. These methods included activities to develop creativity, case studies, home and extended experiences, home visits, interviews, problem solving, programmed learning, puppets, supervised study and team teaching...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{improving}} the third grade students’ speaking skills through <b>flannel</b> <b>board</b> based activities at SD Kanisius Bonoharjo, Sentolo, Kulon Progo. This study is action research. The researcher followed procedures of action research proposed by Kemmis and McTaggert 1988 in Burns (1999 : 32 - 33). This research consisted of four procedures, they were; reconnaissance, planning, implementing and observing the actions, and reflection. The action consisted of two cycles with three meetings in cycle 1 and two meetings in cycle 2. The subjects of the research were the third grade students of SD Kanisius Bonoharjo, the principal and a student of English Education Department Yogyakarta State University as the collaborators and the researcher. The data collection techniques were observations, interviews and tests, which were {{in the form of}} field notes, interview transcripts and students’ speaking scores. In analysing those data, two methods were used. The qualitative data were analysed in three steps; data reduction, data display, and conclusion drawing and verification. The quantitative data in the form of pre-test and post-test scores were analysed by comparing the mean scores. The research showed that the implementation of <b>flannel</b> <b>board</b> based activities, classroom English, and listening activities has improved students’ speaking skills.

40|$|This is a {{participatory}} project {{developed in}} a Portuguese kindergarten and organized into two phases. The first {{is the development of}} a multidisciplinary activity plan made for and with children. The goal is to work with children in a TALK area inside the classroom to improve language, and to initiate them into Information Communication Technologies (ICT) skills promoting Media Education (ME) as well. In Portugal, ICT integration is rarely implemented at kindergarten age, and frequently uses dependent technologies (requiring adult assistance). On the other hand, in literature tangible interfaces are considered a good approach to fulfill child abilities and start digital literacy. The second phase intends to update a low-cost manipulative to the same end: a digital <b>flannel</b> <b>board.</b> Nevertheless, children are its design builders, and as co-researchers they will plan, execute, explore, play and evaluate their own interface.

The {{research was conducted}} in the Logan and Providence areas of Cache County, Utah, with 24 non-preschool four-year-old children. Twelve {{of the children were}} given tutorial experience through the use of children 2 ̆ 7 s <b>flannel</b> <b>board</b> stories written by the author. The stories were developed to t each the number concepts of not first or last, second, third, pair, and Medium sized. It was found that the 12 children who received tutorial experiences significantly increased in score on the Boehm Test of Basic Concepts from the pre-test to the first post-test, and further, that there was a slight but insignificant loss of knowledge after a six-week waiting period on the number concepts taught. The control group, which received no tutorial experience, made no significant gain in score on any of the tests. The findings also indicated that {{there was no significant difference}} between boys and girls on their ability to learn and retain number concepts. The control group boys made a slight gain in score from the pre-test to the second post-test that was unrelated to any tutorial experience...|$|E
40|$|A {{practicum}} {{was executed}} {{with the primary}} purpose of enhancing prekindergarten students ' ability to address conflicts in a positive prosocial manner. The location of the practicum was an urban elementary school which houses prekindergarten through grade 6. A literacy program (consisting of storytelling activities using the various forms of children's literature, role playing, puppetry, <b>flannel</b> <b>board,</b> organized games, and physical movement) and a citizenship program providing opportunities for students to be distinguished for exhibiting appropriate social behavi 3 r were implemented during a 12 -week period. Students completed conflict inventories near {{the beginning and end of}} the practicum period. Students were also observed during "choice time " and recess. Results indicated that: (1) inappropriate acts of conflict before the practicum numbered over 30 per day and dropped considerably during the last 4 weeks of the practicum; (2) students ' ability to determine the appropriate course of action in the event of a conflict increased significantly; and (3) students received both programs with much enthusiasm.

40|$|Includes bibliographiesAuthorities {{agree that}} using {{multicultural}} folktales {{with young children}} can improve their self-concept, strengthen their cultural identity, and aid their moral development. Literature {{is one of the}} main ways culture is transmitted. Knowledge of his cultural heritage can improve a child's self-concept. Research shows that children who feel good about themselves are more successful in school. Secondly, use of literature can develop self-awareness, aid interpersonal relationships, clarify values and hence foster moral development. The universal feelings and experiences in folktales can help children learn about themselves and others and their values. Folktales are especially appropriate for young children. They are charmingly brief and to the point. Children are attracted by the picturesque language. The all good or all bad characters, the simple plot and the promise of a happy resolution are at the child's level of understanding. Folktales teach the values of the represented culture and encourage moral development. Folktales promise that all difficult obstacles will be overcome and that the virtuous will be rewarded. They satisfy the child's fantasy of security, achievement and love. Folktales are best told orally in the storyteller tradition. Included in this project are twenty folktales from different countries. These folktales are organized around themes. There are illustrations for teachers to reproduce and use on a <b>flannel</b> <b>board,</b> questions to ask, literary comparisons, art ideas and science ideas...|$|E
40|$|A {{research}} {{experiment was}} performed in the Utah State University Child Development Laboratory {{on a group of}} pre-school children consisting of ten boys and ten girls between the ages of three and four years in an attempt to discover that teaching method which will best sustain a child 2 ̆ 7 s interest while teaching a foreign language in an experimental situation. The procedure involved the evaluation of three different methods. 1) German conversation in a group utilizing audio-visual aids, 2) Group singing of a German song, and 3) Telling a story in German using a <b>flannel</b> <b>board</b> with illustrations. These three methods were performed three times each over a five-week period. The results showed that there was not statistically a significant difference. The findings did show, however, that the flannelboard story sustained the interest of the group best, next the singing of a German song and the least effective was conversation in German. The results did indicate that the interest of the children dropped considerably from the first to the third time that the conversation method was performed. The interest of the children increased considerably from the first to the third time that the singing of a German Bong was performed. The interest of the children appeared to stay about the same over the three times that the flannel-board story was performed. Femininity and masculinity appear to influence the responses of children to a language-learning situation. That method which will best sustain children 2 ̆ 7 s interest in a language-learning situation appears to be dependent on where the children are in their familiarity with the language...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to design English teaching learning kits which facilitate the teacher in teaching English to elementary school children. The kits are easy to reach, to use, and to understand because they are completed with teacher’s guide. The next objective was to find out the characteristics of the appropriate design of materials for the fifth grade pupils of SDN 14 Pelutan, Pemalang. This is Research and Development (R&D). The research steps of this research consisted of the needs survey, needs analysis, writing the course grid, developing the materials, evaluating the first draft of the materials, revising the first draft, implementing the second draft, and writing the final draft. The instruments of the data collection were questionnaires, an interview guide, and the observation guide. The types of the data were quantitative and qualitative. They were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. The materials were evaluated and revised based on the data obtained. The results of the study were the kits included the course grid, lesson plans, the materials, teacher’s guides, hands out, flashcards, a <b>flannel</b> <b>board,</b> and CDs of listening tasks and songs. The result of the study showed that the designed materials had the characteristics of appropriate design of English Teaching Learning Kits proposed by the experts. The result of the expert judgement questionnaires also showed that the mean score of material aspect was 133. 54 (Good), the kits aspect was 13. 62 (Very Good), and media aspect was 13. 77 (Very Good). Therefore, the characteristics of good materials were 1) matching with standard and basic competencies, 2) providing materials which are interesting, motivating, suitable, and organized from easy to difficult level, 3) making the students communicate, interact with friends in English and more active in English class, 4) consisting of individual, pair and group work, 5) including integrated skills, 6) providing songs and games which are appropriate with the topics, easily mastered by the teacher, various, interesting, motivating the students, and having clear games rules. Then, good kits should be easy to use, suitable with the teacher’s needs, and provide clear instructions, while good media should be interesting, motivating, and easy to use...|$|E
40|$|Reading is an {{important}} activity for any learner. Without reading skills, the journey of the learner {{is likely to be}} full of hurdles. This is especially true when it concerns learning English as a second language. In developing countries, there is a significant need to develop reading skills. Because of the rote-memory approach to learning in developing countries, learners lag behind in this area i. e. the traditional approach does not consider reading to be contributing to knowledge and understanding, and expects students to regurgitate the lessons to prove their knowledge acquisition. Researchers who were referred to in the literature review found that reading skills have a catalytic contribution to a person 2 ̆ 7 s learning rate, and they further say that it is best to focus on the Early Years learners to develop their reading skills, as young learners are quick and can learn double the rate of the adult learners. Recent research suggests that in order to develop reading skills, {{it is not necessary to}} spend a lot of money, but only to portray reading as an enjoyable activity and to develop students 2 ̆ 7 interest in the activity. The purpose of this research is to study the use of storybooks as a tool to develop reading skills through enjoyment. Thus, the researcher makes an effort to support the five year old young learners in their reading efforts by using the innovative tool of story-telling. To comprehend this, the researcher endeavored on the path of action research and worked with Early Years teachers in a private school in Karachi, Pakistan. A strategic action plan was prepared and implemented in order to facilitate the students in their reading development. Subsequent planning and action remain responsive to any need for change arising out of the experiences of implementing the previous one. The data for the action process was collected through semi-structured interviews, lesson observation notes, the researcher 2 ̆ 7 s reflective diary and tape-recording of the sessions. The gathered data was analyzed soon after each action step for reflection and further action. The research findings confirm that story books motivate the young learners to read books. On one hand, this lends support to the development of vocabulary, comprehension, and language as well. On the other hand, it was found that lack of resources like appropriate story books for the age level, as well as lack of resources for story-telling like puppets, <b>flannel</b> <b>board,</b> etc., hinder the useful facilitation of the process. Moreover, the most significant finding of the research was students 2 ̆ 7 attention span i. e. it was found that the duration of the students 2 ̆ 7 attention span was not more than ten to fifteen minutes, which made it difficult for the researcher to have them sit for the entire duration of a story-telling session, or to engage them in oral discussion for an adequate span of time. The dissertation concludes with the suggestion that training is required for Early Years teachers to participate in the activity of story-telling. In addition, a long-term plan designed by the teacher educators might resolve the crisis of preparing teaching aids for story-telling and story books...|$|E
