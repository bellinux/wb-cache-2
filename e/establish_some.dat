5|$|In 1928, Hastings became {{involved}} in the Savidge Inquiry. Sir Leo Chiozza Money was a noted journalist, economist and former Liberal MP. On 23 April 1928, he and Miss Irene Savidge were sitting in Hyde Park in London when they were arrested by two plain-clothes police officers and taken to the nearest police station, where they were charged under the Parks Regulation Act 1872 with committing an indecent offence. The next morning, they were remanded for a week at Great Marlborough Street Police Court. At the next hearing a week later, the case was dismissed by the magistrate, who criticised the police for failing to contact a man seen running through the park to <b>establish</b> <b>some</b> kind of corroborative evidence, and failing to report at once to Scotland Yard to avoid having to charge the defendants immediately.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} arrival in New York, where he knew nobody and spoke no English, Berkman became an anarchist through his {{involvement}} with groups that had formed to campaign to free the men convicted of the 1886 Haymarket bombing. He joined the Pioneers of Liberty, the first Jewish anarchist group in the U.S. The group was affiliated with the International Working People's Association, the organization to which the Haymarket defendants had belonged, and they regarded the Haymarket men as martyrs. Since most of its members worked in the garment industry, the Pioneers of Liberty took part in strikes against sweatshops and helped <b>establish</b> <b>some</b> of the first Jewish labor unions in the city. Before long, Berkman {{was one of the}} prominent members of the organization.|$|E
5|$|With {{expansion}} {{came the}} need for efficient governance and thus, beginning in 1841, Sarawak was separated into {{the first of its}} administrative divisions with currency, the Sarawak dollar, beginning circulation in 1858. By 1912, a total of five divisions had been established in Sarawak, each headed by a Resident. The Brooke family generally practised a paternalistic form of government with minimal bureaucracy, but were pressured to <b>establish</b> <b>some</b> form of legal framework. Since they were unfamiliar with local customs, the Brooke government created an advisory Supreme Council, mostly consisting of Malay chiefs, to provide guidance. This council is the oldest state legislative assembly in Malaysia, with the first General Council meeting taking place at Bintulu in 1867. In 1928, a Judicial Commissioner, Thomas Stirling Boyd, was appointed as the first legally trained judge. A similar system relating to matters concerning various Chinese communities was also formed. Members of the local community were encouraged by the Brooke regime to focus on particular functions within the territory: the Ibans and other Dayak people were hired as militia while Malays were primarily administrators. Chinese, both local and immigrant, were mostly employed in plantations, mines and as bureaucrats. Expanding trade {{led to the formation of}} the Borneo Company Limited in 1856. The company was, and still is, involved in a wide range of businesses in Sarawak including trade, banking, agriculture, mineral exploration, and development.|$|E

Throughout Europe, trees are known as sites of pilgrimages, ritual ambulation, and the recital of (Christian) prayers. Wreaths, ribbons or rags are suspended to win favor for sick humans or livestock, or merely for good luck. Popular belief associates the sites with healing, bewitching, or mere wishing.|$|E

25|$|The Mount Lowe Railway {{was born}} from a {{desire of the}} Pasadena Pioneers to have a scenic {{mountain}} railroad to {{the crest of the}} San Gabriel Mountains. There was already established a trail to the peak of Mount Wilson, but that trip was arduous and ofttimes required more than a day to travel up and down.

A number of historical non-Christian documents, such as Jewish and Greco-Roman sources, {{have been used in}} historical analyses of the chronology of Jesus.

25|$|Oldcastle now {{put himself}} {{at the head of}} a {{widespread}} Lollard conspiracy, which assumed a definite political character. The plan was to seize the King and his brothers during a Twelfth-night mumming at Eltham, and <b>establish</b> <b>some</b> sort of commonwealth. Oldcastle was to be Regent, the king, nobility and clergy placed under restraint, and the abbeys dissolved and their riches shared out. King Henry, forewarned of their intention by a spy, moved to London, and when the Lollards assembled in force in St Giles's Fields on 10 January they were easily dispersed by the king and his forces.|$|E
25|$|With {{the number}} of {{survivors}} declining, in 1996, the 75th anniversary of the riot, a bi-partisan group {{in the state legislature}} authorized formation of the Oklahoma Commission to Study the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921. Members were appointed to investigate events, interview survivors, hear testimony from the public, and prepare a report of events. There was an effort toward public education about these events through the process. The Commission's final report published in 2001 said that the city had conspired with the white mob against the Tulsa black community; it recommended a program of reparations to survivors and their descendants. The state passed legislation to <b>establish</b> <b>some</b> scholarships for descendants of survivors, encourage economic development of Greenwood, and develop a memorial park in Tulsa to the riot victims. The park was dedicated in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Hermeneutic {{therapists}} use {{memory and}} imagination to envision others’ experiences in their minds. As they do, possibilities {{come to the}} mind of the therapist that might not present themselves to the client: possibilities for potential re-interpretation, healing, meaning, relating, and discovery (knowledge). It is for these reasons that hermeneuts consider imagination is so vital to not only reflexive development but it is vital to therapists as an intersubjective tool to help promote growth in clients by bringing “to mind what is presently absent", which helps <b>establish</b> <b>some</b> stability to one's knowledge and, in turn, establish personal truth and meaning about a self and his or her experiences. Finally, the knowledge produced from imagination is only constitutive of a person's (client's) identity and experiences when that person marks that knowledge as meaningful to his- or herself, thus reinforcing the impact of co-created meaning in counseling.|$|E

25|$|During the High Middle Ages, {{which began}} after 1000, the {{population}} of Europe increased greatly as technological and agricultural innovations allowed trade to flourish and crop yields to increase. Manorialism—the organization of peasants into villages that owed rents and labour service to nobles—and feudalism—a political structure whereby knights and lower-status nobles owed military service to their overlords {{in return for the}} right to rents from lands and manors—were two of the ways of organizing medieval society that developed during the High Middle Ages. Kingdoms became more centralized after the decentralizing effects of the breakup of the Carolingian Empire. The Crusades, first preached in 1095, were an attempt by western Christians from countries such as the Kingdom of England, the Kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire to regain control of the Holy Land from the Muslims and succeeded long enough to <b>establish</b> <b>some</b> Christian states in the Near East. Also, merchants imported thousands of Armenians, Circassians, Georgians, Greeks and Slavs into Italy to work as household slaves and in processing sugar. Intellectual life was marked by scholasticism and the founding of universities, while the building of Gothic cathedrals was one of the outstanding artistic achievements of the age.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to Galligan, {{many of the}} supporting actors and actresses were better known. Veteran actor Glynn Turman portrayed the high school science teacher whose study of a newborn Mogwai leads to his death after it forms a cocoon and emerges as a vicious gremlin. Dick Miller, who was a regular in Dante's films, was another experienced actor on the set, playing a World War II veteran who first refers to the creatures as gremlins. Rand was played by Hoyt Axton, who was always the filmmakers' preferred choice for the role {{even though it was}} widely contested by other actors. Axton's experience included acting as the father in The Black Stallion (1979), and he was also a country music singer-songwriter. After an introductory scene to Gremlins was cut, Axton's voice earned him the added role of the narrator to <b>establish</b> <b>some</b> context. Mr. Wing was played by Keye Luke, a renowned film actor, whose film career spanned half a century. Although in reality he was around 80 at the time of filming, and his character was very elderly, Luke's youthful appearance had to be covered by make-up.|$|E

[...] At HitFix, Alan Sepinwall called it [...] "by far the busiest episode of the series to date," [...] remarking that it not only moved [...] "pieces around the chess board to set things up for the season's final two episodes," [...] but also included [...] "some crackling dialogue, a few good character moments and some of the best action the show has featured to date." [...] David Sims from the A.V. Club wrote that the episode [...] "masterfully kept us abreast of everything going on, while sticking to the point-of-view style the show has held from the start."
