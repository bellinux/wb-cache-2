5|$|On May 10, 1999, Debra won the Women's Championship from Sable in an Evening Gown match. Usually, in an Evening Gown match, {{the woman}} who {{forcibly}} removes her opponent's dress wins. Because Sable removed Debra's dress, she therefore {{should have been the}} winner. Commissioner Shawn Michaels, however, ruled that he considered {{the woman who}} <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>her</b> dress the winner, crowning Debra the new Women's Champion. Debra lost the Women's Title to Ivory on June 14, due to interference from Nicole Bass.|$|E
5|$|Betty {{was born}} at 6 Tile Street, Weatherfield on 4 February 1920 to Harold and Margaret Preston. During World War II, she {{had an affair with}} {{serviceman}} Ted Farrell (Gerald Sim), resulting in a son, Gordon (Bill Kenwright; Geoffrey Leesley). Ted left her to return to his family and Gordon was adopted by Betty's sister Maggie (Irene Sutcliffe) and her husband Les Clegg (John Sharp). Betty celebrated {{the end of the war}} with her sweetheart Billy Williams (Frank Mills), to whom she <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>her</b> virginity. The two lost touch, and in 1949, Betty married policeman Cyril Turpin (William Moore).|$|E
5|$|For a {{while it}} seemed that Franklin would also be burnt, but her crew were able {{to put out the}} fires. With Brueys killed aboard Orient, Du Chayla now became commander. Both he and Captain Gillet had been seriously wounded and taken below, but he {{continued}} to order the attack. The brief quiet that had resulted from the explosion of the Orient was broken by Franklins guns, and the battle resumed. She fought for another hour, but by then she <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>her</b> main and mizzenmasts, nearly all of her cannons had been knocked out, and over half her crew were dead or wounded. She finally struck her colours.|$|E

5|$|For example, {{near the}} mouth of the Yangtze, the baiji was a princess that <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>her</b> parents and had lived with her step-father, whom she had longed to get away from. The step-father wanted to trade her since she would have been sold for a great sum of money, but as they were {{crossing}} the river to get to the trader, a storm rolled in, and they were drenched. The step-father, enraged, tried to take her, but she plunged herself into the river. Before being drowned in the river, she was transformed into a dolphin, and swam away from her abusive step-father, who also fell in and was transformed into a porpoise.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the war {{he spent}} most of his time flying {{throughout}} Europe and meeting various commanding officers and units. He took advantage of his position to fly other types he had not had the chance to operate. He flew Supermarine Spitfires frequently on such trips. Soon after the Normandy Campaign he took leave to visit his mother in Ireland. She was staying with his sister Mary, (and his niece) who <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>her</b> husband killed in action at Anzio in Italy. He remained with 11 Group until the capitulation of Germany on 8 May 1945.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth {{was born}} at Greenwich Palace and was named after both her grandmothers, Elizabeth of York and Elizabeth Howard. She was the second child of Henry VIII of England born in wedlock to survive infancy. Her mother was Henry's second wife, Anne Boleyn. At birth, Elizabeth was the heir {{presumptive}} to the throne of England. Her older half-sister, Mary, <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>her</b> position as a legitimate heir when Henry annulled his marriage to Mary's mother, Catherine of Aragon, to marry Anne, {{with the intent to}} sire a male heir and ensure the Tudor succession. She was baptised on 10 September; Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, the Marquess of Exeter, the Duchess of Norfolk and the Dowager Marchioness of Dorset stood as her godparents.|$|E
5|$|For an {{hour the}} frigates {{exchanged}} broadsides, until 01:15 when Hamelin, who had realised {{that he was}} fighting a warship not a troopship or East Indiaman, dropped back to effect repairs after suffering damage to his rigging. Ceylon was more severely damaged than the French ship and when Hamelin returned at 02:15, her repairs were not complete, preventing her escape. The battle began again, both frigates suffering serious damage in the second encounter. By 03:00, Vénus <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>her</b> mizzenmast and two topmasts, while Ceylon had lost all of her topmasts, which had destroyed much of the ship's rigging as they fell. With both ships now unable to manoeuvre, the action continued at close range until 04:00, when Vénus was able to haul herself away to await the arrival of Victor.|$|E
5|$|Henry VII touched {{seven or}} eight {{infected}} people annually, and there were intervals lasting several years during {{which he did not}} perform the ritual at all. Henry VIII (r. 1509–1547) touched 59 people between early January 1530 and late December 1532. The Protestant Edward VI (r. 1547–1553) apparently did not perform the ritual, but the Catholic Mary I (r. 1553–1558) took it somewhat more seriously. Early in her reign, the Protestant Elizabeth I was reluctant to participate in a ritual whose efficacy she probably doubted. Although she resumed the practice in 1570, after the Roman Catholic Church excommunicated her and alleged that she <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>her</b> healing power, Elizabeth decisively downplayed her own role in the miraculous healing. The Elizabethan surgeon William Clowes, who asserted that the royal touch proved her legitimacy, claimed that Elizabeth could also heal foreigners, citing a Dutchman as an example.|$|E

5|$|In 1933, H.D. {{traveled}} to Vienna to undergo analysis with Sigmund Freud. She {{had an interest}} in Freud's theories as far back as 1909, when she read some of his works in the original German. H.D. was referred by Bryher's psychoanalyst due to her apparent paranoia about the rise of Adolf Hitler which indicated another world war, an idea that H.D. found intolerable. The Great War (World War I) had left her feeling shattered. She <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>her</b> brother in action, while her husband suffered effects of combat experiences, and she believed that the onslaught of the war indirectly caused the death of her child with Aldington: she believed it was her shock at hearing the news about the RMS Lusitania that directly caused her child to be stillborn. Writing on the Wall, her memoir about this psychoanalysis, was written concurrently with Trilogy and published in 1944; in 1956 it was republished with Advent, a journal of the analysis, under the title Tribute to Freud.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately for Captain Segond, when dawn broke on 18 October, HMS Anson was {{revealed}} {{only a short}} distance off, limping southwards after the damage its rigging and masts had suffered before the battle on 12 October. Although his ship was almost unmanageable, Captain Durham {{was not prepared to}} lose a second opportunity to engage, and slowly brought his vessel to bear on Loire, which was unable to escape. Accompanying Anson was Kangaroo, recovered from the damage of 16 October and ready for further action. At 10:30, Anson and Loire began firing on one another, neither able to effectively manoeuvre and both relying on firepower to overwhelm their opponent. Kangaroo closed on the unprotected stern of Loire, firing as she did so and repeatedly raking the immobile French ship. By 12:00 Loire <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>her</b> mainmast and was leaking badly, forcing Segond to surrender. His ship was towed to port as the sixth prize of the campaign.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} after {{assuming}} command, on 15 October 1917, Stuart was on hand to rescue the United States Navy destroyer USS Cassin after she was torpedoed by U-61 in heavy weather. Along with one crewmember killed and nine wounded, the Cassin <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>her</b> entire stern including the rudder and {{was in danger of}} sinking. The dead crew member was Osmond Ingram, who had died throwing burning munitions overboard and was later posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. Twenty miles from the Irish coast and in total darkness, the Tamarisk not only found the crippled ship but was able to come alongside in high seas and a strong gale and pass across a tow line. Twice during the night the tow broke and twice it was reconnected as the battle to save the ship continued. The next morning several trawlers came to the aid of the Q-ship and together they enabled the Cassin to make port, saving the ship and her crew. Ten years after the Cassin's rescue the US Navy awarded Stuart the Navy Cross in recognition of his part in the operation; it was a rare presentation to a sailor of a foreign navy and the only occasion in which the recipient also possessed the Victoria Cross.|$|E

5|$|Sarita began turning villainous on the June 25 {{episode of}} Xplosion, when she {{interfered}} and helped Wilde defeat Daffney {{to end the}} team's long losing streak. The following week, when Wilde confronted her tag team partner and explained {{that she did not}} want to win by cheating, Sarita claimed that she was a winner and, unlike Wilde, did not need her tag team partner's help in her match against Daffney. After Sarita was defeated by Daffney in a singles match, Wilde came to the ring and stopped her tag team partner from attacking her opponent. On the July 1 episode of Impact!, Sarita cemented her villainous turn by attacking Wilde after she <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>her</b> match against the Knockouts Champion Madison Rayne, proclaiming she was sick of losing matches. Sarita and Wilde faced each other on the following episode of Xplosion, with Sarita picking up the pinfall victory by putting her feet on the ropes for leverage. On the July 15 episode of Impact!, Sarita defeated Wilde again, this time in a Street Fight. At the July 26 tapings of Impact!, Stock tore her triceps and was expected to miss two months of in-ring action. She returned at the September 6 tapings of Xplosion, defeating Daffney.|$|E
