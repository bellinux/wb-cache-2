The Coach and Horses at No.1 and the Marlborough Head at Nos.37–38 were both {{established}} in the 1730s.

5|$|Anwar {{is thought}} to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the poet Chairil Anwar, an individualistic anarchist known for being abrasive, having kleptomania, and womanizing. The poet's friend Nasjah Djamin notes that the {{characterization}} captured the real-life Anwar's nonchalance, impoliteness, and arrogance.|$|E
5|$|Chaucer's Criseyde is {{swayed by}} Diomedes playing on her fear. Pandarus is now her uncle, more worldly-wise and {{more active in}} what happens and so Troilus is more passive. This {{passivity}} is given comic treatment when Troilus passes out in Criseyde's bedroom and is lifted into her bed by Pandarus. Troilus' repeated emotional paralysis is {{comparable to that of}} Hamlet who may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> him. It can be seen as driven by loyalty both to Criseyde and to his homeland, but has also been interpreted less kindly.|$|E

5|$|Copernicium {{was first}} created on February 9, 1996, at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany, by Sigurd Hofmann, Victor Ninov et al. This element {{was created by}} firing {{accelerated}} zinc-70 nuclei at a target made of lead-208 nuclei in a heavy ion accelerator. A single atom (a second was reported but was found to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> data fabricated by Ninov) of copernicium was produced with a mass number of 277.|$|E
5|$|Given that Gadge is {{revealed}} {{to actually be}} a witch, Howick asked Shearsmith whether the former's character, Thomas, truly had witnessed Gadge engaging {{in some kind of}} supernatural activity. Shearsmith suggested that Thomas was motivated by greed. However, he begins to regret his choice when he witnesses Gadge being tortured. Pemberton, though, noted that the real-life accusations of witchcraft must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> some level of belief.|$|E
5|$|She {{was also}} {{scheduled}} to play Fiona Carrick-Smith in the 2013 indie crime drama film Monster Butler.

Lynch also starred in indie teen comedy G.B.F., which screened at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York in April 2013 and at the Frameline Film Festival in San Francisco on 30 June 2013.|$|E

5|$|The Samba was not {{the only}} Talbot model to see {{customer}} interest waning; as the 1980s progressed, all Talbots began to sell rather poorly and the range was gradually phased out. Peugeot had been working on developing a replacement for the Samba as late as 1984, which would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the forthcoming Citroen AX, but this project was abandoned as Peugeot took the decision to phase out the Talbot brand, and the Peugeot 205 was proving so popular that Peugeot felt little need for a third car of this size within the group.|$|E
5|$|The main façade is {{topped by}} a simple wooden raking cornice that surmounts an {{ornamental}} corbel brick pendant. A semicircular fanlight, or lunette, {{is located in the}} center of the gable of the building's main façade, providing lighting to the building's attic. Chambers described this window as the most antiquated of the building's architectural elements and may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the fanlight of the county's earlier courthouse built in 1833, which was located to the building's east.|$|E

5|$|With {{the advent}} of phylogenetic {{taxonomy}} in vertebrate paleontology, Tyrannosauridae has been given several explicit definitions. The original was produced by Paul Sereno in 1998, and included all tyrannosauroids closer to Tyrannosaurus than to either Alectrosaurus, Aublysodon or Nanotyrannus. However, Nanotyrannus is often {{considered to be a}} juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex, while Aublysodon is usually regarded as a nomen dubium unsuitable for use in the definition of a clade. Definitions since then <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> more well-established genera.|$|E
5|$|Among {{his later}} works, {{following}} in his traditional sketches {{about his life}} and people he has met, were Hurry-Graphs (1851), Out-Doors at Idlewild (1854), and Ragbag (1855). Willis had complained that his magazine writing prevented him from writing a longer work. He finally had the time in 1856, and he wrote his only novel, Paul Fane, which was published a year later. The character Bosh Blivins, who served as comic relief in the novel, may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> painter Chester Harding. His final work was The Convalescent (1859), which included a chapter on his time spent with Washington Irving at Sunnyside.|$|E
5|$|At least 27 operas <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> Romeo and Juliet. The earliest, Romeo und Julie in 1776, a Singspiel by Georg Benda, omits much of {{the action}} of the play and most of its {{characters}} and has a happy ending. It is occasionally revived. The best-known is Gounod's 1867 Roméo et Juliette (libretto by Jules Barbier and Michel Carré), a critical triumph when first performed and frequently revived today. Bellini's I Capuleti e i Montecchi is also revived from time to time, but has sometimes been judged unfavourably because of its perceived liberties with Shakespeare; however, Bellini and his librettist, Felice Romani, worked from Italian sources—principally Romani's libretto for Giulietta e Romeo by Nicola Vaccai—rather than directly adapting Shakespeare's play. Among later operas, there is Heinrich Sutermeister's 1940 work Romeo und Julia.|$|E

5|$|Despite Mitică's {{association}} with Bucharest and his usual most common {{career as a}} state employee, several commentators have recounted that he may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> Gheorghe Matheescu, an entrepreneur {{from the town of}} Sinaia (located on the Prahova Valley, in northern Muntenia). Matheescu took pride in this supposed connection, and, around 1939, argued in its favor in front of literary historian Şerban Cioculescu. Cioculescu recorded the rumor, and indicated that it was backed by information received from Caragiale's daughter, Ecaterina Logadi. Her father reportedly enjoyed Matheescu's company, and, in 1901, even authored short advertisements for his store.|$|E
5|$|During the High Middle Ages tales {{originating}} from Brythonic traditions entered English folklore—the Arthurian myth. These {{were derived from}} Anglo-Norman, Welsh and French sources, featuring King Arthur, Camelot, Excalibur, Merlin and the Knights of the Round Table such as Lancelot. These stories are most centrally brought together within Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain). Another early figure from British tradition, King Cole, may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> a real figure from Sub-Roman Britain. Many of the tales and pseudo-histories make up part of the wider Matter of Britain, a collection of shared British folklore.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{claimed that the}} hostility of Bede has {{obscured}} Penda's importance as ruler who wielded an imperium {{similar to that of}} other prominent 7th century 'overkings'. Penda's hegemony included lesser rulers of both Anglo-Saxon and British origins, non-Christian and Christian alike. The relationships between Penda, as hegemon, and his subordinate rulers would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> personal as well as political ties, and they would often have been reinforced by dynastic marriages. It has been asserted that Penda's court would have been cosmopolitan, multi-ethnic, multi-lingual and tolerant. Though a pagan himself, there is evidence that the contemporary Mercian elite contained significant Christian and British elements. Penda must have been intimate with many Britons and may have been bilingual himself.|$|E

5|$|Many {{hypothetical}} extinct macaws {{were based}} only on contemporaneous accounts, but these species are considered dubious today. Several of them were named in the early 20th century by Rothschild, who {{had a tendency to}} name species based on little tangible evidence. Among others, the red-headed macaw (Ara erythrocephala) and the Jamaican red macaw (Ara gossei) were named for accounts of macaws on Jamaica, and the Dominican green-and-yellow macaw (Ara atwoodi) was supposedly from Dominica island. The violet macaw (Anodorhynchus purpurascens), which was named for accounts of blue parrots supposedly from Guadeloupe, is now thought to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> references to the Guadeloupe amazon (Amazona violacea).|$|E
5|$|Originally, the {{athletic}} teams had no official colors and often used gray or maroon and gray for their uniforms. Senior classes would sometimes select colors {{of their own}} choosing. In modern times, the uniforms <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> some combination of the four colors of the Maryland flag: red, white, black, and gold. The dominant colors have occasionally changed {{back and forth with}} changes of the head coach. In 1904, Maryland adopted a state flag based on the heraldry of Lord Calvert: the Calvert family arms (black and gold) quartered with his mother's Crossland family arms (red and white). From the early 1920s until 1942, the black and gold were adopted as the official school colors.|$|E
5|$|Speyer's two {{principal}} legacies {{are the three}} deep-level tube lines of the London Underground, and the Promenade Concerts. The former {{might not have been}} built without the finance he raised with Yerkes, and would have struggled without his chairmanship. The latter may have failed in the early 20th century without his financial support. The tube lines now form the central sections of the Underground's Northern, Piccadilly and Bakerloo lines. After Speyer's funding of the Promenade Concerts ended, they were taken over by music publishers Chappell & Co. and, in 1927, by the BBC. The characters of Sir Hermann and Lady Aline Gurtner in E. F. Benson's 1919 novel Robin Linnet were based on Sir Edgar and Lady Speyer. Leanne Langley suggests that the character of Appleton, a villainous stockbroker, in John Buchan's The Thirty-Nine Steps may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> Speyer.|$|E
