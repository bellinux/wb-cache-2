40|$|We have {{discovered}} that DNA supercoiling, {{in the absence of}} replication proteins, induces localized unwinding in the Escherichia coli replication origin (oriC) at the same sequence opened by the dnaA initiator protein. The DNA helix at the tandemly repeated, 13 mer sequence is thermodynamically unstable, as evidenced by hypersensitivity to single-strand-specific nuclease in a negatively supercoiled plasmid, and demonstrated by stable DNA unwinding seen after two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of topoisomers. A replication-defective oriC mutant lacking the leftmost 13 mer shows no nuclease hypersensitivity in two remaining 13 mers and no detectable DNA unwinding on two-dimensional gels. The replication defect in the oriC mutant can be corrected by inserting a dissimilar DNA sequence with reduced helical stability in place of the leftmost 13 mer. Thus, the <b>helical</b> <b>instability</b> of the leftmost 13 mer, not the specific 13 mer sequence, is essential for origin function. The rightmost 13 mer exhibits <b>helical</b> <b>instability</b> but differs from the leftmost 13 mer in its strict sequence conservation among related bacterial origins. The repeated 13 mer region appears to serve two overlapping functions: protein recognition and <b>helical</b> <b>instability.</b> We propose that the cis-acting sequence whose <b>helical</b> <b>instability</b> is required for origin function be called the DNA unwinding element (DUE) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{have defined}} a {{replication}} origin, ORI 305, within chromosome III of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{by means of}} mutational analysis. cis-acting elements required for origin activity in the chromosome, as assayed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of replication intermediates, {{are the same as}} those required for the function of an autonomously replicating sequence, ARS 305, in a plasmid. Essential elements include (i) an 11 bp sequence that is a near match to the ARS consensus and (ii) a broad sequence directly 3 ' to the consensus near match. Origin function is inactivated by point mutations in the essential near match sequence, suggesting that the sequence contributes to specifying the origin in the chromosome. Other consensus near matches with different sequences are present but are not required. The essential 3 '-flanking sequence exhibits DNA <b>helical</b> <b>instability</b> and is sensitive to deletion mutations that stabilize the DNA helix. The wild-type 3 '-flanking sequence can be functionally substituted by dissimilar sequences that also exhibit <b>helical</b> <b>instability.</b> The requirement for DNA <b>helical</b> <b>instability</b> indicates that the essential 3 '-flanking sequence serves as a DNA unwinding element in the chromosome...|$|E
40|$|Earlier {{studies on}} the H 4 {{autonomously}} replicating sequence (ARS) identified a DNA unwinding element (DUE), a required sequence that is hypersensitive to single-strand-specific nucleases and serves to facilitate origin unwinding. Here we demonstrate that a DUE can be identified in the C 2 G 1 ARS, a chromosomal replication origin, by using a computer program that calculates DNA helical stability from the base sequence. The helical stability minima correctly predict the location and hierarchy of the nuclease-hypersensitive sites in a C 2 G 1 ARS plasmid. Nucleotide-level mapping shows that the nuclease-hypersensitive site at the ARS spans a 100 -base-pair sequence in the required 3 '-flanking region. Mutations that stabilize the DNA helix in the broad 3 '-flanking region reduce or abolish ARS-mediated plasmid replication, indicating that <b>helical</b> <b>instability</b> is required for origin function. The level of <b>helical</b> <b>instability</b> is quantitatively related to the replication efficiency of the ARS mutants. Multiple copies of either a consensus-related sequence present in the C 2 G 1 ARS or the consensus sequence itself in synthetic ARS elements contribute to DNA <b>helical</b> <b>instability.</b> Our findings indicate that a DUE is a conserved component of the C 2 G 1 ARS and is {{a major determinant of}} replication origin activity...|$|E

The relevant parameter in these studies in the swirl S which measures the ratio of the azimuthal velocity with respect to the axial velocity. The present paper is dedicated to the influence of the spatio-temporal development of <b>helical</b> <b>instabilities</b> in the mode selection in swirling jets both in the pre- (S Sc) regime. An interpretation of the double-helix structure observed for swirl ratios less than critical by Billant, Chomaz and Huerre (1998) is proposed, based on the local absolutely unstable nature of the swirling jet with regard to the azimuthal wavenumber m = − 2 mode at nozzle exit. Secondly, the spiral form of vortex breakdown observed in the numerical simulations of Ruith, Chen, Meiburg and Maxworthy (2003) is interpreted as the consequence of the development of a so-called nonlinear global mode originating in the convective/absolute transition of the instability in the lee of the vortex breakdown bubble. 1 Helical structures at the pre-breakdown stage The goal of this first part is to identify the selection mechanism responsible for the appear...|$|R

40|$|Passive {{and active}} control of {{swirling}} turbulent jets is experimentally investigated. Initial swirl distribution {{is shown to}} dominate the free jet evolution in the passive mode. Vortex breakdown, a manifestation of high intensity swirl, was achieved at below critical swirl number (S = 0. 48) by reducing the vortex core diameter. The response of a swirling turbulent jet to single frequency, plane wave acoustic excitation was shown to depend strongly on the swirl number, excitation Strouhal number, amplitude of the excitation wave, and core turbulence in a low speed cold jet. A 10 percent reduction of the mean centerline velocity at x/D = 9. 0 (and a corresponding increase in the shear layer momentum thickness) was achieved by large amplitude internal plane wave acoustic excitation. <b>Helical</b> <b>instability</b> waves of negative azimuthal wave numbers exhibit larger amplification rates than the plane waves in swirling free jets, according to hydrodynamic stability theory.

The main implications of this effect are: hysteresis and strongly non-linear dynamical behavior leading to growth, proliferation and possibly exiting from a crystal of superclimbing dislocations. Three major channels for such dynamics are identified: i) injection and inflation of the prismatic loops from the boundary; ii) Bardeed-Herring generation of the loops in the bulk; iii) <b>helical</b> <b>instability</b> of the screw dislocations.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} multiwavelength {{observations}} of helical kink insta-bility as a trigger of a CME which occurred in AR NOAA 11163 on 24 February 2011. The CME {{was associated with}} a M 3. 5 limb flare. High resolution observa-tions from SDO/AIA suggest the development of <b>helical</b> kink <b>instability</b> in the erupting prominence, which implies a flux rope structure of the magnetic field. A brightening starts below the apex of the prominence with its slow rising mo-tion (∼ 100 km s− 1) during the activation phase. A bright structure, indicative of a helix with ∼ 3 - 4 turns, was transiently formed at this position. The corre-sponding twist of ∼ 6 pi- 8 pi is sufficient to generate the <b>helical</b> kink <b>instability</b> in a flux rope according to recently developed models. A slowly rising blob structure was subsequently formed at the apex of the prominence, and a flaring loop was observed near the footpoints. Within two minutes, a second blob was formed in the northern prominence leg. The second blob erupts (like a plasmoid ejection) with the detachment of the northern prominence leg, and flare intensity max-imizes. The first blob at the prominence apex shows rotational motion in the counterclockwise direction in the plane of sky, interpreted as unwinding motion of a helix, and it also erupts to give the coronal mass ejection (CME). RHESSI hard X-ray sources show the two footpoint sources and a loop-top source dur-ing the flare. We found RHESSI hard X-ray flux, soft X-ray flux derivative and CME acceleration in the low corona correlate well, which is in agreement with the standard flare model (CSHKP). We also discuss the possible role of ballooning as well as torus instabilities in driving the CME. We conclude that the CME and flare were triggered by the <b>helical</b> kink <b>instability</b> in a flux rope and accelerated mainly by the torus instability...|$|R

No argon ion spectrum was observed at any position in the tube. No changes in the spectrum from the positive column were observed with changing operating conditions.

Kinematic and stress variables are expanded as a function of this small parameter and introduced in the equations. It leads classically to a sequence of equations at successive orders. This strategy is used to obtain a time dependent membrane model. The stationary solution is equivalent to the one obtained using the classical approach. This model allows to develop a stability analysis, first in the axisymmetric case and then in the non axisymmetric one. Even a crude Newtonian temperature dependent rheology allows to capture qualitatively the observed instability phenomena...|$|R
40|$|The ideal <b>helical</b> kink <b>instability</b> of a force-free coronal {{magnetic}} flux rope, {{anchored in the}} photosphere, is studied {{as a model for}} solar eruptions. Using the flux rope model of Titov & Demoulin (1999 } as the initial condition in MHD simulations, both the development of helical shape and the rise profile of a confined (or failed) filament eruption (on 2002 May 27) are reproduced in very good agreement with the observations. By modifying the model such that the magnetic field decreases more rapidly with height above the flux rope, a full (or ejective) eruption of the rope is obtained in very good agreement with the developing helical shape and the exponential-to-linear rise profile of a fast coronal mass ejection (CME) (on 2001 May 15). This confirms that the <b>helical</b> kink <b>instability</b> of a twisted {{magnetic flux}} rope can be the mechanism of the initiation and the initial driver of solar eruptions. The agreement of the simulations with properties that are characteristic of many eruptions suggests that they are often triggered by the kink instability.

40|$|The {{temporal}} evolution of isolated turbulent Batchelor vortices is investigated using pseudo-spectral direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the vorticity transport equations. Analytic {{treatment of the}} velocity at the domain boundaries (Rennich et al. (1997)) effectively isolates the vortex. The flow dynamics is examined over a range of swirl numbers. (The swirl number q {{is a measure of}} the ratio of the azimuthal and axial velocities). For the cases in which the mean flow is unstable to normal mode perturbations (q < 1. 5), <b>helical</b> <b>instabilities</b> are seen to grow and advect radially. The local stretching and tilting of vortex lines by these instabilities is seen to generate mean counter-signed axial vorticity, and as a consequence, a circulation overshoot. The velocity field introduced by the distorted vortex tubes tries to concentrate the axial vorticity away from the centerline. For low swirl cases, the axial vorticity is briefly shifted almost entirely to helical lobes near the edge of the vortical core. Ultimately, the coherence of the helical structures is lost and the flow progresses toward equilibrium. Angular momentum transport to the exterior potential flow is seen to be enhanced by the radial advection of streamwise oriented vorticity. During the return to equilibrium, azimuthal vorticity is present in the exterior of the core in the form of highly stretched spirals. While there is very little turbulent mixing in the inner part of the core, the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation are seen to peak at the core centerline. 1...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{buoyancy}} has a major influence on the flow structure of turbulent nonpremixed jet flames. Buoyancy acts by inducing baroclinic torques, which generate large-scale vortical structures that can significantly modify the flow field. Furthermore, some suggest that buoyancy can substantially influence the large-scale structure of even nominally momentum-dominated flames, since the low velocity flow outside of the flame will be more susceptible to buoyancy effects. Even subtle buoyancy effects may be important because changes in the large-scale structure affects the local entrainment and fluctuating strain rate, and hence the structure of the flame. Previous studies that have compared the structure of normal- and micro-gravity nonpremixed jet flames note that flames in microgravity are longer and wider than in normal-gravity. This trend was observed for jet flames ranging from laminar to turbulent regimes. Furthermore, imaging of the flames has shown possible evidence of <b>helical</b> <b>instabilities</b> and disturbances starting {{from the base of the}} flame in microgravity.

40|$|The {{rotation}} of erupting filaments {{in the solar}} corona is addressed through a parametric simulation study of unstable, rotating flux ropes in bipolar force-free initial equilibrium. The Lorentz force due to the external shear field component and the relaxation of tension in the twisted field are the major contributors to the rotation in this model, while reconnection with the ambient field is of minor importance. Both major mechanisms writhe the flux rope axis, converting part of the initial twist helicity, and produce rotation profiles which, to a large part, are very similar {{in a range of}} shear-twist combinations. A difference lies in the tendency of twist-driven rotation to saturate at lower heights than shear-driven rotation. For parameters characteristic of the source regions of erupting filaments and coronal mass ejections, the shear field is found to be the dominant origin of rotations in the corona and to be required if the rotation reaches angles of order 90 degrees and higher; it dominates even if the twist exceeds the threshold of the <b>helical</b> kink <b>instability.</b> The contributions by shear and twist to the total rotation can be disentangled in the analysis of observations if the rotation and rise profiles are simultaneously compared with model calculations. The resulting twist estimate allows one to judge whether the <b>helical</b> kink <b>instability</b> occurred. This is demonstrated for the erupting prominence in the "Cartwheel CME" on 9 April 2008, which has shown a {{rotation of}} ≈ 115 degrees up to a height of 1. 5 R_sun above the photosphere.

It is well documented that various large-scale quasiperiodic flow structures, such as a precessing vortex core (PVC) and multiple vortex <b>helical</b> <b>instabilities,</b> are present in the swirling flows typical of air swirl fuel injectors. Prediction of these phenomena requires time-resolved computational methods. The focus of the present work was to compare the performance and cost implications of two computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodologies—unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes (URANS) using a k- model and large eddy simulation (LES) for such flows. The test case was a single stream radial swirler geometry, which {{has been the subject of}} extensive experimental investigation. Both approaches captured the gross (time-mean) features of strongly swirling confined flows in reasonable agreement with experiment. The temporal dynamics of the quadruple vortex pattern emanating from within the swirler and observed experimentally were successfully predicted by LES, but not by URANS. Spectral analysis of two flow configurations (with and without a central jet) revealed various coherent frequencies embedded within the broadband turbulent frequency range. LES reproduced these characteristics, in excellent agreement with experimental data, whereas URANS predicted the presence of coherent motions but at incorrect amplitudes and frequencies. For the no-jet case, LES-predicted spectral data indicated the occurrence of a PVC, which was also observed experimentally for this flow condition; the URANS solution failed to reproduce this measured trend. On the evidence of this study, although k- based URANS offers considerable computational savings, its inability to capture the temporal characteristics of the flows studied here sufficiently accurately suggests that only LES-based CFD, which captures the stochastic nature of the turbulence much more faithfully, is to be recommended for fuel injector flows...|$|R
