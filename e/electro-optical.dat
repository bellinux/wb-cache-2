5|$|Although blue phases are of {{interest}} for fast light modulators or tunable photonic crystals, they exist in a very narrow temperature range, usually less than a few kelvin. Recently the stabilization of blue phases over a temperature range of more than 60K including room temperature (260–326K) has been demonstrated. Blue phases stabilized at room temperature allow <b>electro-optical</b> switching with response times {{of the order of}} 10−4s.|$|E
5|$|To improve {{operations}} at low altitude, the AN/ASQ-151 <b>Electro-Optical</b> Viewing System (EVS), {{which consisted of}} a Low Light Level Television (LLLTV) and a Forward looking infrared (FLIR) system mounted in blisters under the noses of B-52Gs and Hs between 1972 and 1976. The navigational capabilities of the B-52 were later augmented {{with the addition of}} GPS in the 1980s. The IBM AP-101, also used on the Rockwell B-1 Lancer bomber and the Space Shuttle, was the B-52's main computer.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the Technicolor Corporation {{contracted}} with SRI {{to develop a}} near-instantaneous, <b>electro-optical</b> alternative to the manual process of timing during film copying. In 1959, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented the Scientific and Engineering Award jointly to SRI and Technicolor for their work on the design {{and development of the}} Technicolor electronic printing timer which greatly benefited the motion picture industry. In 1954, Southern Pacific asked SRI to investigate ways of reducing damage during rail freight shipments by mitigating shock to railroad box cars. This investigation led to William K. MacCurdy's development of the Hydra-Cushion technology, which remains standard today.|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, the Danish Ministry of Defence {{reportedly}} {{could not}} afford the retrofitting of the AW101 fleet for Afghanistan operations, against earlier reports of a deployment in 2012. In February 2013, Aviation Week reported that earlier reliability problems had been resolved and that a full upgrade package would be applied to Danish AW101s; these included the addition of electronic warfare pods and a new <b>electro-optical</b> system, in advance of a deployment in Afghanistan in 2014. In September 2013, Danish AW101s were to receive L-3 Wescam MX-15 electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensors; SAR aircraft already carry the FLIR Systems Star Safire II EO/IR sensor.|$|E
5|$|A {{helmet-mounted sight}} (HMS) {{developed}} by Luoyang Electro-Optics Technology Development Centre of AVIC {{was developed in}} parallel with the JF-17; it was first tested on Prototype 04 in 2006. It was dubbed as EO HMS, (<b>Electro-Optical</b> Helmet Mounted Sight) and was first revealed {{to the public in}} 2008 at the 7th Zhuhai Airshow, where a partial mock-up was on display. The HMS tracks the pilot's head and eye movements to guide missiles towards the pilot's visual target. An externally carried day/night laser designator targeting pod may be integrated with the avionics to guide laser-guided bombs (LGBs). An extra hardpoint may be added under the starboard air intake, opposite the cannon, for such pods. To reduce the numbers of targeting pods required, the aircraft's tactical data link can transmit target data to other aircraft not equipped with targeting pods. The communication systems comprise two VHF/UHF radios; the VHF radio has the capacity for data linking for communication with ground control centres, airborne early warning and control aircraft and combat aircraft with compatible data links for network-centric warfare, and improved situation awareness.|$|E
5|$|The postwar {{years were}} spent {{implementing}} {{the lessons of}} the Yom Kippur War. SEAD tactics were improved, training was stepped up and innovative technologies introduced. The Hammers cooperated with Rafael, Israel's weapon systems development authority, in the introduction of the Tadmit <b>electro-optical</b> fire-and-forget guided bomb, {{a modified version of the}} AGM-62 Walleye II. At the same time, the Phantom's air-to-air role was diminished with the introduction into service of the F-15 Eagle and the F-16 Fighting Falcon. The squadron was, nonetheless, the first IAF squadron to introduce Rafael's Python 3 into service in March 1977. Air-to-air training continued and on December 29, 1977, during combat against a pair of F-15s, two squadron aircraft collided. Squadron leader Avsha Friedman and navigator Avihu Ikar were killed. The remains of their aircraft, Kurnass 305, stand as a memorial to the two pilots on the Acre-Carmiel road. On January 20, 1981, the squadron lost another pilot in similar circumstances, when Kurnass 222 collided with F-16 222. Squadron leader Eliezer Adar ejected, but Dani Weiss was killed, as was the F-16 pilot, Uri Ben-Amitai.|$|E
25|$|Both <b>electro-optical</b> and radar sensors {{have been}} coupled with {{acoustic}} sensors in modern counter-artillery systems. <b>Electro-optical</b> sensors are directional and precise, so {{need to be}} cued by acoustic or other omnidirectional sensors. The original Canadian sensors, in the First World War, used <b>electro-optical</b> flash as well as geophysical sound sensors.|$|E
25|$|HH-60U: USAF UH-60M version {{modified}} with an <b>electro-optical</b> sensor {{and rescue}} hoist. Three in use by Air Force pilots and special mission aviators since 2011. Has 85% commonality with HH-60W.|$|E
25|$|Complementing counter-mortar radar is the Israeli Purple Hawk mast-mounted <b>electro-optical</b> sensor, which detects mortars and {{provides}} perimeter security. The device, remotely operated via fiber optics or microwave, {{is intended to}} have a laser designator.|$|E
25|$|The BMP-3 {{also has}} the ability to carry a Shtora <b>electro-optical</b> jammer that {{disrupts}} semiautomatic command to line of sight (SACLOS) antitank guided missiles, laser rangefinders and target designators. Shtora is a soft-kill, or passive-countermeasure system.|$|E
25|$|It is an {{excellent}} example of automatic cueing of one sensor by another. Depending on the application, the sensitive but less selective sensor is either acoustic or non-imaging <b>electro-optical.</b> The selective sensor is forward looking infrared (FLIR).|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} {{branches}} of MASINT, specific techniques may overlap with the six major conceptual disciplines of MASINT {{defined by the}} Center for MASINT Studies and Research, which divides MASINT into <b>Electro-optical,</b> Nuclear, Geophysical, Radar, Materials, and Radiofrequency disciplines.|$|E
25|$|<b>Electro-optical</b> MASINT is a subdiscipline of Measurement and Signature Intelligence, (MASINT) and {{refers to}} {{intelligence}} gathering activities which bring together disparate elements {{that do not}} fit within the definitions of Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), or Human Intelligence (HUMINT).|$|E
25|$|In February 2017, {{photos were}} {{released}} by the Turkish MoD, showing the Hürkuş-C prototype carrying Roketsan UMTAS anti-tank guided missiles, Roketsan Cirit laser-guided rockets, an <b>electro-optical</b> and infrared (EO/IR) pod (likely the Aselsan Common Aperture Targeting System or CATS), and external fuel tanks.|$|E
25|$|The K200 has six {{electrically}} operated smoke grenade launchers mounted {{across the front}} of the hull as countermeasures against <b>electro-optical</b> and infrared targeting. If the KIFV variant features a turret, the smoke grenade launchers mount on the turret (three on each side).|$|E
25|$|The {{basic system}} mode is for rocket detection, since a rocket launch gives a bright flare. In basic operation, RLS has <b>electro-optical</b> systems on three towers, {{separated}} by 2 to 3 kilometers, to give omnidirectional coverage. The tower equipment {{connects to the}} control stations using a wireless network.|$|E
25|$|According to Jane's Information Group, XV230 {{was one of}} six Nimrods {{equipped}} with an L-3 Wescam MX-15 <b>electro-optical</b> turret in 2003. In June/July 2006 XV230 was given the capability to transmit real-time video imagery from the MX-15 to ground stations and commanders. This was implemented under Project Broadsword.|$|E
25|$|Mortar {{launches}} do {{not produce}} as strong an <b>electro-optical</b> signature as does a rocket, so RLS relies on acoustic signature cueing from an Unattended Transient Acoustic Measurement and Signal Intelligence System (UTAMS). There is an UTAMS array {{at the top of}} each of the three RLS towers. The tower heads can be rotated remotely.|$|E
25|$|<b>Electro-optical</b> {{spectroscopy}} is {{one means}} of chemical detection, especially using non-dispersive infrared spectroscopy is one MASINT technology that {{lends itself to}} early warning of deliberate or actual releases. In general, however, chemical sensors tend to {{use a combination of}} gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, which are more associated with materials MASINT. See Chemical Warfare and Improvised Chemical Devices.|$|E
25|$|The patrol {{boats are}} {{fitted with a}} Bridgemaster E surface search and navigational radar, a Toplite <b>electro-optical</b> {{detection}} system, and a Warrlock direction finding system. A Prism III radar warning system was fitted to the last two boats during construction, and refitted to the rest. Tenders for an Naval Unmanned Aerial System (NUAS) capability for the Armidale class were requested in mid-2014.|$|E
25|$|In December 2013 Thales Group was {{selected}} as mission suite supplier for 100 million euro worth contract. A contract with Thales for delivery of the integrated combat system for the Ślązak was signed in March 2014. The deal include TACTICOS Combat Management System, SMART-S Mk2 surveillance radar, STING-EO Mk2 fire control radar, MIRADOR <b>electro-optical</b> observation and fire control system and LINK 11/16 tactical data link system.|$|E
25|$|Under Hyland's guidance, the Aerospace Group {{continued}} to diversify and become massively profitable, {{and became a}} primary focus of the company. The company developed radar systems, <b>electro-optical</b> systems, the first working laser, aircraft computer systems, missile systems, ion-propulsion engines (for space travel), and many other advanced technologies. The 'Electronic Properties Information Center' (EPIC) of the United States was hosted at the Hughes Culver City library in the 1970s. EPIC published the multi-volume Handbook of Electronic Materials as public documents.|$|E
25|$|The UOMZ 101KS Atoll <b>electro-optical</b> system {{includes}} the 101KS-V infra-red search and track turret {{mounted on the}} starboard side {{in front of the}} cockpit. This sensor can detect, identify, and track multiple airborne targets simultaneously. The 101KS-O infrared countermeasure system has sensors housed in turrets mounted on the dorsal spine and forward fuselage and uses laser-based countermeasures against heat-seeking missiles. The Atoll complex also {{includes the}} 101KS-U ultraviolet missile warning sensors and 101KS-N navigation and targeting pod.|$|E
25|$|After several {{supporting}} {{experiments were}} published, Jacques et al. claimed that an experiment of theirs follows fully the original scheme proposed by Wheeler. Their complicated experiment {{is based on}} the Mach-Zender interferometer, involving a triggered diamond N-V colour centre photon generator, polarization, and an <b>electro-optical</b> modulator acting as a switchable beam splitter. Measuring in a closed configuration showed interference, while measuring in an open configuration allowed the path of the particle to be determined, which made interference impossible.|$|E
25|$|The {{mission of}} the Sensors Directorate, located at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, {{is to provide a}} full range of air and space sensors, {{networked}} to the warfighter, providing a complete and timely picture of the battlespace enabling precision targeting of the enemy and protection friendly air and space assets and its core technology areas include: radar, active and passive <b>electro-optical</b> targeting systems, navigation aids, automatic target recognition, sensor fusion, threat warning and threat countermeasures. The current Director is Ruth Moser.|$|E
25|$|The Falco UAV's {{maiden flight}} {{took place in}} December 2003 and Galileo Avionica had {{completed}} platform qualification in late October 2004. Over 40 hours of flight-testing had been completed by then at the Salto di Quirra test range in Sardinia. Validation of flight controls had been completed in September 2004. Testing of the onboard systems was planned to be started in early 2005 and integration of the <b>electro-optical</b> sensor suite planned for July 2005. Radar installation was scheduled to begin in 2006.|$|E
25|$|Mission objective: To {{provide a}} satellite-based Resident Space Object (RSO) observing service {{that will provide}} {{accurate}} tracking data on deep space orbiting objects. Sapphire is the Canadian Department of National Defence's first dedicated operational military satellite. Its space-based <b>electro-optical</b> sensor will track man-made space objects in Earth orbits between 6000 and 40,000 km as part of Canada's continued support of Space Situational Awareness and the U.S. Space Surveillance Network by updating the U.S. Satellite Catalogue {{that is used by}} both NORAD and Canada.|$|E
25|$|Boeing {{publicly}} {{identified the}} Royal New Zealand Air Force {{as a potential}} customer in 2008. The P-8 would replace its fleet of P-3 Orions which are due for replacement in 2025. In April 2017, the U.S. State Department approved the possible foreign military sale of up to four P-8As with associated equipment and support, including engines, <b>electro-optical</b> and infrared sensors, radar, an acoustic system, electronic support measures, laser transmitters, missile warning sensors, embedded GPS systems, system processors and mission software, valued at US$1.46 billion.|$|E
25|$|Alenia Aermacchi will be {{the second}} source {{supplier}} of the wing box. Under the terms of agreement Alenia Aeronautica is slated to produce more than 1,200 wings for the F-35 for the nine partners, United States, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Turkey, Australia, Canada, Denmark and Norway. Other participation in the program includes work on the <b>electro-optical</b> targeting system, on the electronic-warfare suite, ejection seat, radio, 25mm gun and DAS systems, performed by Leonardo-Finmeccanica's companies. Avio participated in both the Pratt & Whitney F135 and General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 powerplant programs.|$|E
25|$|Israel also develops, manufactures, {{and exports}} {{a large number}} of related {{aerospace}} products, including rockets and satellites, display systems, aeronautical computers, instrumentation systems, drones and flight simulators. Israel's second largest defense company is Elbit Systems, which makes <b>electro-optical</b> systems for air, sea and ground forces; drones; control and monitoring systems; communications systems and more. The Technion - Israel Institute of Technology is home to the Asher Space Research Institute, which is unique in Israel as a university-based center of space research. At ASRI, Israeli students designed, built and launched their own satellite: Gurwin TechSat.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to radar-guided missiles, IR-guided missiles {{are very difficult}} to find as they approach aircraft. They do not emit detectable radar, and they are generally fired from a rear visual-aspect, directly toward the engines. In most cases, pilots have to rely on their wingmen to spot the missile's smoke trail and alert them. Since IR-guided missiles are inherently far shorter-legged in distance and altitude range than their radar-guided counterparts, good situational awareness of altitude and potential threats continues to be an effective defense. More advanced <b>electro-optical</b> systems can detect missile launches automatically from the distinct thermal emissions of a missile's rocket motor.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the main radar, the Hobarts will be fitted with a Northrop Grumman AN/SPQ-9B X-band pulse Doppler horizon search radar, a Raytheon Mark 99 fire-control system with two continuous wave illuminating radars for missile direction, and two L-3 Communications SAM Electronics X-band navigation radars. The ships are fitted with an Ultra Electronics Sonar Systems' Integrated Sonar System, which includes a hull-mounted sonar and a towed variable depth sonar built up from a quad directional active-passive receive array, a passive torpedo detection array and a high-powered towed sonar source. Other sensors include an Ultra Electronics Series 2500 <b>electro-optical</b> director, a Sagem VAMPIR IR search and track system, and Rafael Toplite stabilised target acquisition sights for each ship's Typhoons.|$|E
25|$|Hughes Aircraft Company, a {{division}} of Hughes Tool Company, was founded by Hughes in 1932, in a rented corner of a Lockheed Aircraft Corporation hangar in Burbank, California, to build the H-1 racer. During and after World War II, Hughes fashioned his company into a major defense contractor. The Hughes Helicopters division started in 1947 when helicopter manufacturer Kellett sold their latest design to Hughes for production. The company was a major American aerospace and defense contractor manufacturing numerous technology related products that include spacecraft vehicles, military aircraft, radar systems, <b>electro-optical</b> systems, the first working laser, aircraft computer systems, missile systems, ion-propulsion engines (for space travel), commercial satellites, and other electronics systems.|$|E
25|$|Each array {{consists}} of four microphones and processing equipment. Analyzing the time delays between an acoustic wavefront's interaction with each microphone in the array UTAMS provides an azimuth of origin. The azimuth from each tower is reported to the UTAMS processor at the control station, and a POO is triangulated and displayed. The UTAMS subsystem can also detect and locate the point of impact (POI), but, due {{to the difference between}} the speeds of sound and light, it may take UTAMS as long as 30 seconds to determine the POO for a rocket launch 13km away. This means UTAMS may detect a rocket POI prior to the POO, providing very little if any warning time. but the <b>electro-optical</b> component of RLS will detect the rocket POO earlier.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the Super Hornet's {{avionics}} {{and software}} had a 90% commonality {{with that of}} the F/A-18C/D fleet at the time. Differences include an up-front Touchscreen control display; a large multipurpose color liquid-crystal display; and a fuel display. The Super Hornet has a quadruplex digital fly-by-wire system, as well as a digital flight-control system that detects and corrects for battle damage. Initial production models used the APG-73 radar, later replaced by the AN/APG-79 active electronically scanned array (AESA). The AN/ASQ-228 ATFLIR (Advanced Targeting Forward Looking InfraRed), is the main <b>electro-optical</b> sensor and laser designator pod for the Super Hornet. The communications equipment consist of an AN/ARC-210 VHF/UHF radio and a MIDS-JTRS low volume terminal for HAVE QUICK, SINCGARS and Link 16 connectivity.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Westland {{incorporated}} {{some of the}} technology from the Naval Lynx-3 design into a less-radical Super Lynx. This featured BERP rotor blades, the Westland 30-derived tail rotor, Gem 42 engines, a new under-nose 360-degree radar installation and an optional nose-mounted <b>electro-optical</b> sensor turret. Royal Navy Lynx HAS.3s upgraded to Super Lynx standard were known in service as the Lynx HMA.8, and several export customers ordered new-build or upgraded Super Lynxes. From the 1990s onwards, Westland began offering the Super Lynx 200, which was equipped with LHTEC CTS800 engines, and the Super Lynx 300, which also had a new cockpit and avionics derived from the AgustaWestland EH101. Both of these models have achieved several export sales. In 2002, Flight International reported that more than 40 variants of the Lynx were in service, numbering almost 400 aircraft having been built for various customers.|$|E
