5|$|If {{you guys}} think I'm a diva and I have {{requirements}}, Snoop is the next level. He's the hip-hop king! So his requirements to get to Paris are, like, beyond platinum editions; they're, like, beyond ultra-platinum editions; they're like diamond editions. So we love Snoop and we wish he had been here, but I think shooting him in L.A. will be good because we'll have more time, more control. <b>He</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have gotten really mobbed in the streets here anyway.|$|E
5|$|In late March, polls {{suggested}} McCarthy {{would likely}} win the Wisconsin Primary. Around this time, Johnson decided {{to drop out}} of the race. When he informed Humphrey of his decision, the Vice President urged Johnson to remain as a candidate. Johnson replied that it was not in the best interest of the nation to mix the partisan politics of a presidential election with the ongoing Vietnam crisis, and that if elected, <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not be able to complete the term since the men in his family usually died in their early sixties. A week prior to the primary, on March 31, the President publicly announced that he would not seek nor accept the Democratic Party nomination, thus setting the stage for a Humphrey presidential run.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{began playing}} with the Melbourne Cricket Club in the 1890–91 season. He played two premiership matches early in the season, against Port Melbourne and Richmond, but scored only 13 runs in two innings and was not called upon to bowl. He did not play in another senior premiership game until the next season. In a match against Wesley College in March 1891, he played a high quality innings, scoring 121 runs. Several weeks later, while playing for MCC's seconds against South Melbourne's seconds, he took 13 wickets for 61 runs. The Tasmanian noted that it was pity he had not played that well earlier in the season, or <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have secured a {{permanent}} place in the first XI.|$|E

25|$|Although not {{released}} until 1992 due to legal complications, development of 386BSD, from which NetBSD, OpenBSD and FreeBSD descended, predated that of Linux. Torvalds has {{also stated that}} if 386BSD had been available at the time, <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not have created Linux.|$|E
25|$|Woolley {{proved to}} be a good wicket-keeper, and had his career not paralleled that of Rod Marsh <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have played more {{international}} cricket. In the 1982–83 season Woolley scored 551 runs at 42.38 and took 39 catches and two stumpings, and he got his chance for Australia when Marsh was unavailable for the brief tour of Sri Lanka in April 1983. He played in all four one-day matches and the single Test, becoming Tasmania's first Test player since its entry to the Sheffield Shield. Australia so dominated the Test match in Kandy that he was not needed to bat, but he took five catches in the innings victory.|$|E
25|$|Although Mani {{was blamed}} and {{ultimately}} fired for Velocity's advert having the wrong focus, {{it had in}} fact been Ansell that initially mentioned the concierge aspect to the team. However, Ruth decided to bring Mani back instead, as though Ansell had apologised off-camera and admitted his mistake during the initial boardroom, Mani also mentioned the service, and was extremely rude to Ruth throughout the task, with his refusal to accept any blame for the misleading briefing being a contributing factor to his firing. On his appearance on You're Fired! Mani later admitted that if Ansell hadn't mentioned the concierge service, then <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have.|$|E

25|$|The bad {{election}} result in 2001 was quickly {{followed by a}} leadership battle between Jagland and Stoltenberg. Both Jagland, as leader, and Stoltenberg, as deputy leader, said they were open to be challenged for their positions at the party's congress in November 2002. Stoltenberg refused to say whether he would challenge Jagland for the leadership position, which was seen by political commentators {{as a sign that}} <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> seek the leadership position. In the beginning of February 2002, Jagland, who had been briefly hospitalized in January, and had a subsequent sick leave, said that he would not seek reelection as leader. In November 2002, Stoltenberg was unanimously elected new leader at the party's congress.|$|E
25|$|Toshio Masuda {{was born}} in Kobe, Japan. His father was a seaman. He {{enrolled}} in a technical training school, however, his mindset did not mesh with the school's military indoctrination and he was expelled in July 1945. He next attended the Osaka University of Foreign Studies (now Osaka University) where he specialized in Russian literature. There he became enamoured with French cinema which led him away from Russian grammar and towards {{a career in the}} film industry. He thought he would have been bored as a salaryman and that filmmaking would better suit him but suggested <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not have followed through had his friends not sought similar careers. After graduating in 1949, he moved to Tokyo to study screenwriting at the Shintoho Studio's Scenario Academy.|$|E
25|$|After over a year, Kidd {{was sent}} to England for {{questioning}} by the Parliament of England. The new Tory ministry hoped to use Kidd {{as a tool to}} discredit the Whigs who had backed him, but Kidd refused to name names, naively confident his patrons would reward his loyalty by interceding on his behalf. There is speculation that <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have been spared had he talked. Finding Kidd politically useless, the Tory leaders sent him to stand trial before the High Court of Admiralty in London, for the charges of piracy on high seas and the murder of William Moore. Whilst awaiting trial, Kidd was confined in the infamous Newgate Prison, and wrote several letters to King William requesting clemency.|$|E

25|$|In 1982 the Grand Nationals {{at least}} as far as the {{professionals}} were concerned was a one-event championship. Instead of how much was won over the year, the Pros were required to attend at least eight nationals with the top 28 money-winning pros, A or AA, eligible to compete in a special pro Car main in which the winning pro would receive a 1983 General Motors Pontiac Trans Am automobile and the title no. 1 Pro for 1982, continuing the new tradition of giving the number one pro a Trans Am. Kevin McNeal, No. 1 Pro for 1981 also received one, so did Brian's brother Brent in 1980. Brian Patterson was the pro who had earned the most money prior to the Grand National with $3,694 in winnings, so if the previous system of winning the number one plate was still in force, depending on how he did <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have won under the old system. Indeed, the situation would have been similar to Kevin McNeal, Brian Patterson had maintained the money lead since May.|$|E
500|$|The 2008 presidential {{campaign}} of Tom Tancredo, a Congressman from Colorado began on April 2, 2007 with a formal announcement. The campaign garnered grassroots support and endorsements from conservative Republicans concerned about illegal immigration and border security. However, Tancredo remained {{low in the}} polls and was criticized for his nativist campaign, which had been described as [...] "single-issued." [...] Tancredo stated that <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not win the nomination but hoped his campaign would bring forth more debate on his issue of concern, immigration. On December 20, 2007 Tancredo withdrew from the presidential race, and endorsed Mitt Romney.|$|E
500|$|The Advisory Board was reconstituted {{in part as}} a {{permanent}} Natural Sciences Advisory Board to the NPS. In 1964, Wirth's successor, George B. Hartzog Jr., established the Division of Natural Science Studies, naming biologist George Sprugel Jr. the Service's chief scientist. The memorable idea of a [...] "vignette of primitive America" [...] drew popular attention from readers and the report received widespread publicity and praise amongst conservationists. It was reprinted in several national publications and was also noted in the Sierra Club Bulletin. Leopold often said that had he known the report would be widely read and dissected, <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have written it more carefully.|$|E

500|$|Wiescamp showed Skipper W as a halter horse {{three times}} when the {{stallion}} was four years old. Skipper W was named grand champion stallion at the three shows he attended, the 1948 National Western Stock Show in Denver, the 1948 Colorado State Fair, and the 1948 New Mexico State Fair. Wiescamp later remarked that [...] "I'm glad now that we didn't show him more, because {{he would have been}} before the public so much that <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have been sold." [...] However, Skipper W's American Quarter Horse Association, or AQHA, show record does not show any record of these wins, which is not unusual for horses shown in the 1940s, as the record keeping was not always the best {{during the early years of}} the AQHA.|$|E
500|$|Garcia was not {{selected}} {{a member of}} the National Baseball Hall of Fame. His normal window of eligibility has closed, and he would only be elected by decision of the Hall's Veterans Committee. Baseball historian Bill James dismissed Garcia's low ERA due to the [...] "cold, cavernous Cleveland Municipal Stadium, which at that time had a pitcher's mound higher than white cliffs of Dover". Referring to Garcia's great seasons of 1949 to 1954, baseball historian Wayne Corbett countered, [...] "Garcia's more famous teammates enjoyed the same home-field advantage, but it was Garcia who recorded the staff's lowest ERA in four of those six seasons." [...] Historian Stephen Lombardi wrote, [...] "It is a shame that Mike Garcia is sometimes disregarded. A career such as his does not deserve to fade away from the memory of the overall baseball public." [...] Cleveland sportswriter and Hall of Fame voter Hal Lebovitz wrote, [...] "If Garcia had pitched long enough, <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> be in the Hall of Fame." ...|$|E
500|$|Later that year, Memphis {{city councilman}} E. C. Jones awarded Edwards and Farley with a {{certificate}} [...] "in appreciation of outstanding {{contributions to the}} community". Edwards and Farley also received an honorary city council membership from Jones, who had previously appeared on The Political Cesspool. According to The Commercial Appeal, Jones had not listened to the show before the incident, and was unaware of its ideology. After a reporter informed him of the program's agenda, Jones initially refused to apologize. However, after another reporter confronted him with more details about the show's ideology, he changed his view, saying that <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not appear again. Carol Chumney, {{another member of the}} Memphis City Council, was also invited to appear on The Political Cesspool, but ultimately declined the invitation after listening to an episode of the show; Chumney said, [...] "what I heard was about advocating for prostitution... So I told them I had other commitments." ...|$|E

500|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{receives}} the mail {{of her new}} neighbor, Dr. Drew Baird (Jon Hamm). After going through it, she believes he is the perfect man for her. To try and woo him, she follows the actions of an evil Spanish soap character called [...] "The Generalissimo" [...] from Los Amantes Clandestinos, despite the warnings of Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Elisa (Salma Hayek). She invites Drew to a nonexistent party, and, when he arrives expecting a party, she informs him that the party is scheduled for the following evening, but nevertheless invites him in. While this plan initially appears to work, things go wrong when Liz accidentally gives Drew Rohypnol and he finds some of his opened mail in her handbag. The next day Drew receives some of Liz's mail and reads it. He says that based on her mail <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have wanted to meet Liz, {{in the same vein}} as she had wanted to meet him. They decide to start with a clean slate and go on a real date.|$|E
500|$|For {{his role}} as Charley [...] "the Gent", the brother of Marlon Brando's {{character}} in Elia Kazan's On the Waterfront (1954), Steiger was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Film writer Leo Braudy wrote that the [...] "incessantly repeated images of its taxicab confrontation between Brando and Rod Steiger have made the film iconic". The taxicab scene took eleven hours to shoot and was heavily scripted, despite Brando fuelling the popular myth in his autobiography that the scene was improvised. Brando stated that seven takes were needed because Steiger could not stop crying, which Steiger found to be unfair and inaccurate. Though Steiger retained great respect for Brando as an actor, he disliked {{him as a person}} and frequently complained during the production of Brando's [...] "predilection for leaving the set" [...] immediately after shooting his scenes. Steiger later remarked: [...] "We didn't {{get to know each other}} at all. He always flew solo and I haven't seen him since the film. I do resent him saying he's just a hooker, and that actors are whores". Steiger also responded unfavorably when he learned that Kazan had been awarded an honorary Oscar by the Academy in 1999. In a 1999 interview with BBC News, Steiger said <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not have done On the Waterfront if he had known at the time that Kazan provided the House Un-American Activities Committee with names of performers suspected of being Communists.|$|E
500|$|Sobers {{told the}} media that he had played in Rhodesia as he felt {{it would be good}} for cricket, {{particularly}} after the cancellation of the South African tour of England, and that politics had not entered his mind. He told interviewers that he had had no problems whatsoever in Rhodesia, that sport in Rhodesia appeared to him to be integrated and that he intended to accept Smith's invitation to return there in the future to play more cricket. Reporting Bacher's suggestion of playing in South Africa, Sobers said that <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not do so: [...] "I don't know if I would want to get involved in that," [...] he said, [...] "but it does show that South African cricketers are willing to play with and against players of any colour, race or creed." [...] Sobers said that the white South African members of the Rest of the World squad in England had functioned well as part of the multiracial team, and that he hoped for a similar Rest of the World series in the Caribbean as he believed West Indian cricket fans would enjoy seeing the South African players. He expressed confusion regarding the calls for him to be stripped of his captaincy. [...] "I am a professional cricketer and a sportsman, not a politician," [...] he said. [...] "I went to play cricket. I don't see why this should affect my position as captain of the West Indies team." ...|$|E
50|$|Fischer won the World Cup overall on two {{occasions}} (1996/97 and 1998/99), he's also come second twice (1993/94 and 2004/05), and third three times (1995/96, 1997/98, and 1999/2000). In the 2004/05 season Fischer lost the World Cup by only eleven points, which <b>he</b> most <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have earned had he competed in the final race of the year, but he missed it because of a cold.|$|R
