500|$|The least {{expensive}} route for Kanae to Japan was through Russia. [...] He set off from Paris on 30 June 1916 via England, Norway, and Sweden. [...] In Moscow {{he met the}} Japanese consul and the social critic Noburu Katagami; the latter introduced him to proletarian art and encouraged him to visit Yasnaya Polyana, Leo Tolstoy's home which he had made into a farmers' school. [...] The experienced moved Kanae, who later was to write, [...] "While <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>staying</b> in Moscow {{in the summer of}} 1916, I felt that I had two important missions. [...] One was promotion of children's free painting and the other was establishment of farmers' art." [...] Kanae visited the Moscow Kustar' Museum, which had exhibited peasant arts and crafts since 1885. [...] He praised its sturdy quality and ethnic design, and lamented that industrialization had brought about a degradation in its perceived value and was threatening its survival. [...] An exhibition of children's art impressed Kanae with its free expressiveness.|$|E
500|$|Lennon went to New York with McCartney shortly afterward, telling Cynthia {{she could}} not go with them, so she went {{on a trip to}} Italy with her mother. During Cynthia's holiday in Italy, an [...] "agitated" [...] Mardas {{unexpectedly}} arrived (pacing up and down outside her hotel until she returned) and gave the news that Lennon was planning to sue Cynthia for divorce on grounds of adultery, seek sole custody of Julian, and send Cynthia [...] "back to Hoylake". Mardas also said that he intended to testify in court that Cynthia had committed adultery with him. She said in 2005: [...] "The mere fact that Magic Alex [...] arrived in Italy {{in the middle of the}} night without any prior knowledge of where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>staying</b> made me extremely suspicious. I was being coerced into making it easy for John [...] and Yoko to accuse me of doing something that would make them not look so bad".|$|E
500|$|Kieswetter's {{confident}} and attacking batting style {{was compared to}} that of Kevin Pietersen, another England batsman of South African origin. Although Kieswetter favoured the off-side, he was also strong behind square on both sides, and stood with a typical South African stance, his bat held high. He played with what Wisden described as an [...] "attractive, uncomplicated front-foot technique". He began his career playing in front of his stumps, but once bowlers had worked out his technique, he moved his batting stance to outside the leg stump to give himself more space to drive the ball. This move had some success on flat subcontinental pitches, but was less effective in England, where the ball tended to change direction more. Kieswetter admitted that the change had not worked, saying that [...] "I wasn’t really moving my feet. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>staying</b> leg-side and playing with my hands. My technique just wasn’t strong enough to cope." [...] After being dropped by England, Kieswetter worked on his batting, which had been described by Steve James as a [...] "frenzy at the crease, as manic as a teenager on a night out". He moved back in front of his stumps, and maintained a calmer mentality, aiming to construct an innings.|$|E

500|$|The Shadow of the Glen, {{based on}} a story about an unfaithful wife, was {{attacked}} in print by the Irish nationalist leader Arthur Griffith as [...] "a slur on Irish womanhood". Years later Synge wrote: [...] "When I was writing The Shadow of the Glen some years ago I got more aid than any learning could have given me from a chink in {{the floor of the}} old Wicklow house where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>staying,</b> that let me hear what was being said by the servant girls in the kitchen." [...] This encouraged more critical attacks alleging that Synge described Irish women in an unfair manner. Riders to the Sea was also attacked by nationalists, this time including Patrick Pearse, who decried it because of the author's attitude to God and religion. Pearse, Arthur Griffith and other conservative-minded Catholics claimed Synge had done a disservice to Irish nationalism by not idealising his characters. However, later critics have attacked Synge for idealising the Irish peasantry too much. A third one-act play, The Tinker's Wedding, was drafted around this time, but Synge initially made no attempt to have it performed, largely because of a scene in which a priest is tied up in a sack, which, as he wrote to the publisher Elkin Mathews in 1905, would probably upset [...] "a good many of our Dublin friends".|$|E
500|$|Lennon seemed {{absolutely}} normal {{when she}} returned home the next day, and steadfastly maintained his love for her and their son, saying: [...] "It's you I love Cyn ... I love you {{now more than ever}} before". [...] Lennon went to New York with McCartney shortly after, but as Cynthia was specifically not invited, a trip to Pesaro, in Italy, was arranged with her mother. After an evening with Italian hotelier Roberto Bassanini, Mardas was waiting at the hotel to break the news that Lennon was planning to sue for divorce on grounds of adultery, seek sole custody of Julian, and [...] "send her back to Hoylake". She said in 2005: [...] "The mere fact that 'Magic Alex' [...] arrived in Italy {{in the middle of the}} night without any prior knowledge of where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>staying</b> made me extremely suspicious. I was being coerced into making it easy" ... "to accuse me of doing something that would make them not look so bad." [...] As Lennon had initiated divorce proceedings, it prompted her to exclaim: [...] "Suing me for divorce? On what grounds is he suing me?" [...] When the news of Ono's pregnancy broke, Cynthia started her own divorce proceedings against Lennon on 22 August 1968. The financial settlement was hampered by Lennon's refusing to offer any more than £75,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] )., telling her on the phone that the payment was akin to winning the football pools and that she was not worth any more. The settlement was then raised to £100,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] )., £2,400 annually (equivalent to £ in [...] )., and custody of Julian. Another £100,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] ). was put into a trust fund which Julian would inherit when he was 21. Until that time, his mother would receive the interest payments. Their decree nisi was granted on 8 November 1968. The trust fund had one codicil, which provided for any further children by Lennon, so when Sean Lennon was born in 1975, Julian's inheritance was cut to £50,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] )..|$|E

While he was burned out, {{one of the main}} reasons for leaving was his father's illness. During this sojourn, the always self-critical Evans {{suddenly}} felt his playing had improved. [...] "While <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>staying</b> with my brother in Baton Rouge, I remember finding that somehow I had reached a new level of expression in my playing.

He traveled to Kansas, where he married Hattie Buck (born October 5, 1863) in Oswego, Kansas, on March 15, 1887. Harriet Beatrice Buck was born in Coles County, Illinois on October 5, 1863. She was the fourth of eight children born between 1858 and 1878. Buck's family later moved to Emporia, Kansas, where her father died a few years prior to her marriage. Short and his wife went to Fort Worth, Texas shortly after their wedding but soon boarded a train [...] "for a brief stay in Hot Springs." [...] A.G.

2500|$|... “Although she {{was well}} over forty, she had lost none of her high spirits; she was kind and affectionate, but her {{eccentric}} and despotic nature made her rather formidable. When she heard that I {{was going to marry}} her niece, she took me in hand. From that day my life was no longer my own. She was an early riser and she used to telephone me at eight in the morning. Sometimes she came to the Hotel du Rhin, where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>staying,</b> and sat reading the papers in my room while I dressed. If I happened to be out, she sent her servants all over Paris to look for me and sometimes took part in the search herself. I never had a moment's peace. I had to lunch, dine, go to the theater and supper with her almost every day. She usually slept through the first act of a play, and then woke up with a start to declare that the performance was stupid and that she wished to go somewhere else. We often changed theaters two or three times in one evening. As she felt the cold, she made her footman sit on a chair at the door of her box, holding a small traveling bag filled with shawls, scarves and furs. All these objects were numbered. If by chance, she was awake and felt a draft, she would ask me to bring her such or such a number. I could have put up with all this but unfortunately she had a passion for dancing. At midnight, now wide awake, she would drag me to a night club where she danced till dawn.”The diplomat Maurice Paléologue wrote on 14 October 1913, [...] "Although she is fifty-three, she lives openly with an Argentinian blackguard, dances at Magic City with all comers till two in the morning and associates with the scum of the aerodromes." ...|$|E
