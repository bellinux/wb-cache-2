5|$|In 1893, Rush {{moved his}} family to Sydney. The Banks Crash reduced many Australian {{businessmen}} to ruin, Rush included. His business was built on credit alone: Rush did not even own the Grafton house {{where he and his}} family lived, having mortgaged it <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> who sold it to him. He borrowed from local banks, using his store-keeping business as security. In Sydney, Rush took a lease on the York Hotel, at the corner of King and York Streets, which quickly became known as 'Mick Rush's Hotel', a popular venue for meetings of sportsmen. During the next decade, Rush kept several hotels in the city of Sydney, and operated also as a hotel broker.|$|E
5|$|The sleeve {{front cover}} used a {{black-and-white}} still <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> Who Fell to Earth, in which Bowie, as the character Thomas Jerome Newton, {{steps into the}} space capsule that will return him to his home planet. Bowie had insisted on the cropped black-and-white image as he felt that in the original coloured full-size image the sky looked artificial; when Rykodisc reissued Bowie's catalogue in the early 1990s the colour version was used. The back cover showed Bowie sketching the Kabbalah Sephirot with chalk—something {{he had been doing}} on the set of the film.|$|E
5|$|Doggett and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) {{return to}} Squamash, {{and the two}} ask the sheriff about the murder of an {{unidentified}} transient. Doggett believes that the transient was murdered by Mulder. Doggett and Skinner travel to the cemetery and discover that the grave dug up by the backhoe earlier {{is that of the}} transient. The two find the casket empty, but Doggett notices that the transient tunneled out of his own coffin. The sheriff arrives with the creature—revealed to be a soul eater, a creature that subsists off human disease—at the Hangemuhl home, where the symbol in blood is on the door again. The hideous creature opens its jaws wide and bites Hangemuhl. Doggett suggests to Skinner that Mulder shot someone to protect Hangemuhl <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> {{who was supposed to be}} in that grave. Meanwhile, deep underground, the creature vomits what appears to be the visceral remains of Marie into a person-shaped mold in the soil.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Ryan Key {{lying on his}} bed in an apartment. Suddenly, he gets {{swallowed}} by the bedsheets (this is where the track starts to play). The scene then shifts to Key in another dimension, ending {{up next to the}} wife of another man. The man notices Key, and he runs away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>man.</b> Hiding in the bathroom, Key escapes through a window, where he ends up on a neighborhood street. Someone dressed in dark clothing gestures to offer him a drink, when Key notices he is in a bar filled with Asian people. During part of the video, it features the band performing in front of a crowd wearing suits. The chase continues through a hallway, underwater, to a hospital bed, and back. The video is based in a scene of the 1999 film Being John Malkovich, where Cameron Diaz chases Catherine Keener within the subconscious of Malkovich.|$|E

25|$|The {{organisation}} {{is often}} seen {{within the context of}} other international organisations which featured in science fiction of the post-war era. Among others, these included SMERSH and SPECTRE from the James Bond novels, S.H.I.E.L.D. from Marvel Comics, and U.N.C.L.E. <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> from U.N.C.L.E. – like UNIT, intended as a fictional United Nations intelligence agency.|$|E
25|$|Twentieth Century Fox {{changed the}} title <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> on the Ledge to Fourteen Hours {{at the request}} of Warde's mother, so the picture would not be as closely {{identified}} with her son. Studio chief Darryl F. Zanuck considered changing the setting of the movie to another city for the same reason. But it was ultimately filmed in New York.|$|E
25|$|Preimplantation genetic diagnosis: Genetic testing {{procedures}} that are performed on human embryos {{prior to the}} implantation {{as part of an}} in vitro fertilization procedure. Pre-implantation testing is used when individuals try to conceive a child through in vitro fertilization. Eggs from the woman and sperm <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> are removed and fertilized outside the body to create multiple embryos. The embryos are individually screened for abnormalities, and the ones without abnormalities are implanted in the uterus.|$|E

25|$|Cerinthus (c. 100 AD), {{the founder}} of a heretical school with gnostic elements. Like a Gnostic, Cerinthus {{depicted}} Christ as a heavenly spirit separate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> Jesus, and he cited the demiurge as creating the material world. Unlike the Gnostics, Cerinthus taught Christians to observe the Jewish law; his demiurge was holy, not lowly; and he taught the Second Coming. His gnosis was a secret teaching attributed to an apostle. Some scholars believe that the First Epistle of John was written {{as a response to}} Cerinthus.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, a man {{claimed to}} have frequented the Barrowland Ballroom with the suspect and {{confirmed}} that he knew the killer. The man said that {{he grew up with}} the killer in Cranhill in the east end of Glasgow. Apparently he had read an article in the Evening Times five years previously and suddenly realised that his friend was Bible John. The alleged suspect was traced living in the Netherlands, married to a Dutch woman. Nothing more was ever heard <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> or the reputed suspect.|$|E
25|$|Asia Agcaoili {{spearheaded the}} show for the viewers of Studio 23. Her show, called Pinoy Big Brother on Studio 23: Si Kuya, KaBarkada Mo (English: Filipino Big Brother on Studio 23: Your Brother, Your Buddy), not only {{featured}} snippets from the primetime telecast the night before, but also featured opinion polls both <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> {{on the street and}} those sending SMS, spoof segments, unaired videos, and feed from inside the house (either live feed or footage taped earlier). Studio 23 has stopped the practice since the second Celebrity Edition and instead resorted to airing the delayed late morning/early afternoon feeds.|$|E

25|$|To {{understand}} what happens, {{consider the following}} analogy. Someone throws one ball every second at a man. Assume that balls travel with constant velocity. If the thrower is stationary, the man will receive one ball every second. However, if the thrower is moving towards the man, he will receive balls more frequently because the balls will be less spaced out. The inverse is true if the thrower is moving away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>man.</b> So it is actually the wavelength which is affected; as a consequence, the received frequency is also affected. It may also {{be said that the}} velocity of the wave remains constant whereas wavelength changes; hence frequency also changes.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Christabel {{gives birth}} to a baby boy. Her father is so angry that he swears to have her killed, so he puts her into a small boat with her new-born baby and they are set adrift without food or water, {{at the mercy of}} the winds and the currents, to share a fate that is {{suffered}} also by Emaré and by Geoffrey Chaucer’s heroine Constance in his Canterbury tale <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> of Law. Soon they are driven onto a rock, and mother and baby go ashore to sit with the seagulls. A griffin appears from out of nowhere and carries the baby off.|$|E
25|$|Three {{days after}} both counsels had begun {{introducing}} witnesses, Joan Goshe {{was called to}} testify {{on behalf of the}} prosecution. In response to questioning from prosecution attorneys, Goshe described how, on the afternoon of her disappearance, Beineman had informed her she had accepted a lift home <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> waiting outside the wig shop. When asked to formally identify the individual upon whose motorcycle she had observed waiting outside her shop, Goshe pointed directly at John Norman Collins. The testimony of Joan Goshe was further supported by Patricia Spaulding, who testified as to having observed Collins for between three and four minutes as he had waited for Beineman to return to his motorcycle.|$|E

25|$|The {{father of}} a man arrested in a July 2006 sting by Perverted-Justice {{appeared}} before a Georgia Superior Court judge to seek an arrest warrant for Perverted-Justice Xavier Von Erck, stating that Von Erck solicited the commission of a felony <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>man.</b> The judge found that probable cause existed to believe Von Erck impersonated a girl and solicited {{the man with the}} intent for him to commit a felony, but declined to issue the warrant because when the act occurred, there was no actual girl and thus no crime occurred. The act of soliciting a felony is itself a felony. Attorney Gary Gerrard filed an appeal with the Georgia Court of Appeals, alleging that under Georgia law, solicitation is a felony whether or not a crime occurred. That appeal was ultimately rejected.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, while filming for the show, the CBSA {{conducted}} {{a raid on}} a construction site in Vancouver. They arrested a Mexican national, Oscar Mata Duran, and brought him to an immigration detention centre where he was presented with a filming consent form. Canada's Privacy Commissioner, following a complaint <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>man,</b> investigated. The Commissioner found that the CBSA breached Canada's Privacy Act by filming their interaction with Duran before he was advised {{of the purposes of}} filming and found that the coercive nature of being detained in a holding facility would have prevented Duran from providing informed consent for his appearance. The Commissioner lauded Duran as a real hero for lodging the privacy complaint even though he would not personally benefit from it. Duran was deported following the raid. In light of Duran's complaint the Privacy Commissioner recommended that the CBSA end its participation in the show, the CBSA announced that the show would not return for a fourth season.|$|E
25|$|In {{the winter}} of 1849, the French Ballet Master Jules Perrot arrived in St. Petersburg, having {{accepted}} the position of premier maître de ballet of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres. He was accompanied by his chief collaborator, the prolific Italian composer Cesare Pugni, who was appointed Ballet Composer of the Imperial Theatres, a position created especially for him. Aside from dancing the principal rôles in many of Perrot's productions, Petipa rehearsed older works with the company and assisted Perrot in staging revivals (such as Giselle in 1850, and Le Corsaire in 1858), all the while learning a great deal <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> who {{was at that time}} the most celebrated choreographer in Europe. Although Petipa did not create his own original works during this period, he nevertheless staged many dances for various operas, and on occasion revised dances for Perrot's many revivals of older works.|$|E
