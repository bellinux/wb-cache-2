Three separate hydrologists investigated and determined that {{the removal of the}} dikes on Leque Island would not be expected to impact the water quality of Camano Island’s groundwater aquifer; the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Association</b> then issued a Determination of Non-significance for the project. The concerned groups refused to accept the results, and called for a full Environmental Impact Statement including an extensive groundwater impact study. After extensive testing by an EPA hydrologist and a technical committee, the EPA ruled once again in 2013 that the removal of the dikes would not affect the any aspect of Camano’s water supply. [...] The study pushed the project past the permit dates and required petition of Snohomish County to extend the life of the permits and increasing the expenditures for the permitting process.|$|E

One provision of the European Directive sets that excavated soils that are not reused on site {{should be considered as}} waste and managed as such under national policies. In order to clarify these rules and provide stakeholders with a common operational framework, the French Ministry for Environment called upon BRGM and INERIS to draft a guidance for the reuse of excavated soils in off-site locations (i. e. within road construction, or development projects) and to develop the necessary tools for its implementation at local / regional scale. Following a review of European countries practice in this field, methodological tools have been developed with the support of working groups which included a wide range of stakeholders (professional unions, <b>environmental</b> <b>protection</b> <b>association,</b> planners, lawyers, etc.).

40|$|An air {{monitoring}} program was conducted during 2005 {{to measure the}} impact of wood smoke from solid fuel heaters in a Melbourne residential suburb where there is extensive use of solid fuel heaters. A number of air pollutants including fine and course particles, organic air toxics benzene, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, formaldehyde, carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen were monitored to determine the impact on air quality. Air quality was assessed by comparing the monitoring results to national and State air quality policy objectives and advisory reporting standards. Measured levels were also compared to other EPA air monitoring sites in Melbourne. The study found the main impact to air quality was caused by particles measured during April and May by coarse particles from surrounding soil and mainly by fine particles from wood smoke. Elevated fine particle levels were measured on nine days during June, highest concentration of 43 µg/m³ being measured. Multielemental analysis by Ion Beam Analysis was also undertaken to characterise the fine particles. Measured levels were also compared to other EPA air monitoring sites in Melbourne.
