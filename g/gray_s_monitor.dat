40|$|Network {{monitoring}} {{capabilities are}} critical for both network operators and networked applications. In {{the context of an}} experimental test facility, network measurement is important for researchers experimenting with new network architectures and applications, as well as operators of the test facility itself. The Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) is a sophisticated test facility comprised of multiple “control frameworks. ” In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of <b>S</b> 3 <b>Monitor,</b> a scalable and extensible monitoring service for GENI. A key feature of <b>S</b> 3 <b>Monitor</b> is a flexible design that allows easy “plug in” of new network measurement tools. We discuss our deployment experiences with <b>S</b> 3 <b>Monitor</b> on GENI, and give experimental results to quantify the performance and system footprint of <b>S</b> 3 <b>Monitor.</b> We find that the <b>S</b> 3 <b>Monitor</b> service is light-weight and scales well as the number of paths to be monitored increases...|$|R

The extract was orally administered at a dose of 2, 6. 6, or 20 mg/kg; a significant edema-inhibitory activity in the acute and chronic phases was observed with a dose of 2 and 20 mg/kg, respectively. The extract showed higher anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic effects than the reference drug phenylbutazone (80 mg/kg). Moreover, the extract prevented the occurrence of secondary lesions associated to this pharmacological model...|$|R

It has translucent,linked ameroconidia and very small conidiophores— its unusually small, few conidiophores are the reason why the colonies are white rather than <b>gray.</b> <b>S.</b> keratitidis species have spherical, phialidic conidia.

40|$|When {{tracking}} {{more than}} one object a key problem is that of associating measurements with particular tracks. Recently, powerful statistical approaches such as Probabilistic Multi-Hypothesis Tracking (PMHT) and Probabilistic Least Squares Tracking have been proposed {{to solve the problem}} of measurement to track association. However, in practice other information may often be available, typically classification measurements from automatic target recognition algorithms, which help associate certain measurements with particular tracks. An extension to the Bayesian PMHT approach which allows noisy classification measurements to be incorporated in the tracking and association process is presented. Example results are given to illustrate the performance improvement that can result from this approach. D A <b>Gray,</b> <b>S</b> J Davey, and R L Streit[URL]...|$|R
