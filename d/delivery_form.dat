40|$|Cocrystals and {{amorphous}} solid dispersions have generated {{interest in the}} pharmaceutical industry {{as an alternative to}} more established solid <b>delivery</b> <b>forms.</b> The identification of intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions in a nicotinamide palmitic acid cocrystal and a 50 % w/w acetaminophen–polyvinylpyrrolidone solid dispersion are reported using advanced solid-state magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR methods. The application of a novel 14 N– 1 H HMQC experiment, where coherence transfer is achieved via through-space couplings, is shown to identify specific hydrogen bonding motifs. Additionally, 1 H isotropic chemical shifts and 14 N electric field gradient (EFG) parameters, both accessible from 14 N– 1 H HMQC experiments, are shown to be sensitive to changes in hydrogen bonding geometry. Numerous indicators of molecular association are accessible from this experiment, including NH cross-peaks occurring from intermolecular hydrogen bonds and changes in proton chemical shifts or electric field gradient parameters. First-principles calculations using the GIPAW approach that yield accurate estimates of isotropic chemical shifts, and EFG parameters were used to assist in assignment. It is envisaged that 14 N– 1 H HMQC solid state NMR experiments could become a valuable screening technique of solid <b>delivery</b> <b>forms</b> in the pharmaceutical industr...|$|R

50|$|Lebanese zajal is a semi-improvised, semi-sung or declaimed form {{of poetry}} in the colloquial Lebanese Arabic dialect.

Zajal has close ties in prosody, <b>delivery,</b> <b>form</b> and spirit with various semi-sung colloquial poetry traditions, including such seemingly disparate traditions as those of Nabati Poetry of Arabia and the troubadours of Provence. Many Near-Eastern, Arabian and Mediterranean cultures (including Greece, Algeria, Morocco, Spain and southern France) had, or still have, rich semi-improvised, semi-sung colloquial poetry traditions, which share some traits with Lebanese zajal, such as the verbal duel (e.g. the jeu parti of the troubadours), the use of tambourines or other minimalist percussion instruments, and a chanting chorus of men (Reddadi, in Lebanese) who repeat key verses or refrains recited by the poets.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore and explain the {{circumstances}} in which a highly collaborative integrated project <b>delivery</b> <b>form</b> such an alliance is the most appropriate choice of delivering infrastructure projects. Design/methodology/approach – The paper draws upon two previously published studies on alliancing to enable gathering insights from a quantitative study with some qualitative data that indicates project alliance delivery performance is high and suggests why it may be adopted as a project <b>delivery</b> <b>form.</b> A second qualitative study recently completed and published on integrated collaborative forms of project delivery such as alliances is re-analysed to better understand how and why this form may be successful. Together these two studies allowed a focus on the motivation to form an alliance and specific conditions relating to the alliance party’s level of ability and willingness to deeply collaborate. Findings – The motivation to deeply collaborate may be triggered by specific internal and external trigger mechanisms. These are identified in the paper together with discussion about the requirement of parties to have sufficient knowledge, skills, attributes and experience to collaborate at a deeply engaged level. Research limitations/implications – The data used in the studies were from large scale infrastructure construction projects. The examples are mainly drawn from countries where collaboration is common and culturally acceptable; results may not apply to cultures, country or workplace, where high levels of competition are seen to be the optimal strategy for project delivery success. Also, the data were drawn from construction project management (PM). Other project-based areas such as professional services for example may present a different context and hence a different rationale. Practical implications – The study provides deep insights about the nature of collaboration. It may have wider applicability. Social implications – Project organising is a social activity with social implications for how they are delivered that affect internal as well as external stakeholders. Being mindful about the motivation to choose a particular <b>delivery</b> <b>form</b> is important. Originality/value – This is a new area of research in PM and the world faces a massive demand for large scale complex projects.

40|$|Intestinal {{in vitro}} {{digestion}} of phytosterols esterified with {{conjugated linoleic acid}} (PS-CLA) was performed to study (1) the potential bioaccessibility of the released bioactive-lipid products and (2) the interference with cholesterol bioaccessibility. Commercial food-grade PS ester (PS-C) was assayed as reference. Hydrolysis of PS-CLA by digestive enzymes {{was similar to that}} of PS-C (51 and 47 %, respectively), most lipids products being mainly included in the bioaccessible fraction, namely, the micellar phase (MP). Control assays in the absence of PS esters showed most cholesterol solubilized within the MP, whereas a displacement of total cholesterol was caused from MP after digestion of PS esters (14 and 36 % displacement for PS-CLA and PS-C, respectively), cholesterol being partially precipitated. Precipitated cholesterol was linearly related to a parallel precipitation of saturated-chain PS, mainly determined by sitosterol (R 2 = 0. 936). The higher composition in sitosteryl esters of PS-C with respect to PS-CLA might explain their different effects on cholesterol. Therefore, besides being a lipid <b>delivery</b> <b>form</b> of PS similar to other commercial esterified PS, the PS-CLA might have the additional advantage of being a lipid <b>delivery</b> <b>form</b> of CLA. Moreover, PS-CLA might hinder the bioaccessibility of cholesterol. Furthermore, the qualitative/quantitative profile in esterified PS forms might determine the magnitude of cholesterol interaction. © 2012 American Chemical Society.
