5|$|A {{disastrous}} {{fire started}} {{on the seventh floor}} on the night of 16 March 1954 and spread downwards. The keepers <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> raise the alarm and were driven out of the lighthouse onto the rocks but rescued the next day when the relief vessel arrived as part of its regular schedule. The heat of the fire caused damage to both the interior and the structure and a lightship and series of temporary lights were installed during reconstruction. Three new generators were placed in the lighthouse to provide an electric light source, the lantern being re-lit on 6 August 1959.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{designed}} to fire at trajectories with a steep angle of descent, howitzers can be fired directly, {{as was done}} by the 11th Marine Regiment at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, during the Korean War. Two field batteries fired directly upon a battalion of Chinese infantry; the Marines were forced to brace themselves against their howitzers, as they <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> dig them in. The Chinese infantry took heavy casualties, and were forced to retreat.|$|E
5|$|Kvale {{hoped that}} {{his friend and}} fellow Minnesotan, Senator Henrik Shipstead, could persuade {{sculptor}} Gutzon Borglum to design the medal for no fee or a nominal one. Borglum, who was busy with construction at Stone Mountain in Georgia (he would later sculpt Mount Rushmore), had designed the Stone Mountain Memorial half dollar; he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> accept the work. Buffalo nickel designer James Earle Fraser, {{a member of the}} Commission of Fine Arts, was engaged for a fee of $1,500, about the usual for a commemorative coin.|$|E

25|$|Macleod <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{take any}} {{interest}} in the Pacific, South Arabia, or the Mediterranean. He never met the Maltese leader Dom Mintoff. He described his {{lack of interest in}} the Caribbean Federation as “my main area of failure”. In his final party conference speech as Colonial Secretary, in October 1961, he declared that “I believe quite simply in the brotherhood of man – men of all races, of all colours, of all creeds”.|$|E
25|$|Both ships sank quickly, and Varangberg <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> launch her {{lifeboats}}. Avoceta sank by the stern, and her bows quickly rose to such {{an angle}} that her lifeboats could not be lowered. However, the liner had three liferafts mounted so as to float clear {{in the event of}} a shipwreck, and one of her radio officers survived by clinging to a large piece of her cork cargo that had floated free from one of her holds.|$|E
25|$|Bryant {{then turned}} towards Tony and Sarah Kistan and Andrew Mills. Both men stood {{up at the}} noise of the initial shots, but <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> move away. Andrew Mills was shot in the head. Tony Kistan was also shot from about two metres away, also in the head, but had managed to push his wife away prior to being shot. Sarah Kistan was {{apparently}} not seen by Bryant, as she was under the table by that time.|$|E

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the battle, the rebellion of Postumus had already started, so Gallienus <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> deal {{with the rest of the}} usurpers, namely Balista and Quietus. He came to an agreement with Odenathus, who had just returned from his victorious Persian expedition. Odenathus received the title of dux Romanorum and besieged the usurpers, who were based at Emesa. Eventually, the people of Emesa killed Quietus, and Odenathus arrested and executed Balista about November 261.|$|E
25|$|Emperor Claudius {{fell ill}} {{on the march}} to the battle and {{returned}} to his regional headquarters in Sirmium, leaving Aurelian in charge of operations against the Goths. Aurelian used his cavalry to great effect, breaking the Goths into smaller groups which were easier to deal with. By late summer the Goths were defeated: any survivors were stripped of their animals and booty and were levied into the army or settled as farmers in frontier regions. Aurelian <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> relish his victories; in late August news arrived from Sirmium that emperor Claudius was dead.|$|E
25|$|Soon, Han's {{greatest}} fear approached as the Jurchens treacheriously betrayed its alliance with Song and attacked the Song army by surprise. Han was enlisted {{with the many}} deputies under General Liang Fongping. He was given fifty cavalry {{to take back the}} fortress of Yishan from the Jurchens. Many regarded this as a suicidal assault since there were over 2000 experienced Jin troops guarding it. However, Liang enforced the idea, and Han didn't reject it. Miraculously, Han emerged victorious over the Jurchens. Yet, Han <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> celebrate as all the other armies under Liang had been routed by Jurchens.|$|E

25|$|German and Soviet armies {{relied heavily}} on work horses to pull {{artillery}} and supplies. Horses {{seemed to be a}} cheap and reliable transport especially in the spring and fall mud of the Eastern Front but the associated costs of daily feeding, grooming and handling horses were staggering. In theory horse units could feed off the country, but grazing on grass alone rendered horses unfit for work and the troops <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> spend searching the villages for fodder. Hard-working horses required up to twelve pounds of grain daily; fodder carried by the troops made up a major portion of their supply trains.|$|E
25|$|At Jamestown, {{a warning}} by an Indian boy named Chanco to his employer, Richard Pace, helped reduce total deaths. Pace secured his plantation, and rowed {{across the river}} during the night to alert Jamestown, which allowed colonists some {{defensive}} preparation. They <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> warn outposts, which suffered deaths and captives at almost every location. Several entire communities were essentially wiped out, including Henricus and Wolstenholme Towne at Martin's Hundred. At the Falling Creek Ironworks, which had been seen as promising for the Colony, two women and three children were among the 27 killed, leaving only two colonists alive. The facilities were destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Everyone {{ran from}} the studio but Llamas and Guerrero stayed, hiding under their anchor desks. After the shaking stopped, they both left the Televisa studios through a back door, and hours later they {{were back on the}} air in the studios of Canal de las Estrellas to {{broadcast}} live what was happening. Some members of the Hoy Mismo staff died, including producer Ernesto Villanueva and engineer David Mendoza Córcega, who had just parked at the Televisa building, but <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> escape from his car. The falling debris also killed street vendors who worked just outside the studio building. Reconstruction of the studio building began in 1995 and ended in 2000.|$|E

25|$|Toungoo {{was to get}} a {{much needed}} breather, however. For much of the rainy season of 1542, the Confederation chiefs were still {{coming to terms with}} their new leader Hkonmaing (son of Hkonmaing I of Onbaung), and <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> plan for an invasion. Initially, the {{leadership}} of Mohnyin was deeply unsatisfied with Hkonmaing, who was put on the throne by the Ava court, not only because the heirs of Sawlon felt the throne of Ava was theirs but also because Hkonmaing's father was someone they bitterly fought against in the 1520s. In the end, in August/September 1542, the chiefs reluctantly decided to back Hkonmaing, and form a united front against a rising Toungoo. They agreed to invade Lower Burma in the dry season of 1543–44.|$|E
25|$|These uniforms were officially {{decided by}} edict of the Dajō-kan on December 12, 1872. The Iwakura Mission, which had {{departed}} Japan earlier, also gathered information on uniform design via Hayashi Tadasu. However, the mission <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{wait for a}} final decision before an audience with Queen Victoria. They therefore ordered uniforms in England, based on the designs they had been discussing with the homeland. Unfortunately, the designs they reported back were determined to be impossible to create in Japan's still-immature Western clothing stores and were not adopted directly. The versions ultimately decreed by the Dajō-kan differed considerably from the Iwakura mission's prototypes. The Dajō-kan's edicts were still incomplete {{as a form of}} law, and the details of the original edict itself were in some areas insufficient, so variations were visible depending on the manufacturer.|$|E
25|$|Although it had {{equipment}} {{capable of}} doing serious damage, the Luftwaffe had unclear strategy and poor intelligence. OKL had not been informed that Britain was {{to be considered a}} potential opponent until early 1938. It <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> gather reliable intelligence on Britain's industries. Moreover, OKL could not settle on an appropriate strategy. German planners had to decide whether the Luftwaffe should deliver the weight of its attacks against a specific segment of British industry such as aircraft factories, or against a system of interrelated industries such as Britain's import and distribution network, or even in a blow aimed at breaking the morale of the British population. The Luftwaffes strategy became increasingly aimless over the winter of 1940–1941. Disputes among OKL staff revolved more around tactics than strategy. This method condemned the offensive over Britain to failure before it began.|$|E

25|$|In October 1938, Straffen was {{referred}} to a child guidance clinic for stealing and truancy. In June 1939, he first came before a juvenile court for stealing a purse from a girl and was given two years probation. His probation officer found that Straffen {{did not understand the}} difference between right and wrong, or the meaning of probation. The family was living in crowded lodgings at the time, and Straffen's mother <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> help, so the probation officer took the boy to a psychiatrist. As a result, Straffen was certified as a mental defective under the Mental Deficiency Act 1927. A report was compiled on him in 1940 which gave his Intelligence Quotient as 58 and placed his mental age at six. From June 1940, the local council sent him to a residential school for mentally defective children, St Joseph's School in Sambourne.|$|E
25|$|In 2001 X-rays and a CT scan {{revealed}} that Ötzi had an arrowhead lodged {{in his left}} shoulder when he died, and a matching small tear on his coat. The discovery of the arrowhead prompted researchers to theorize Ötzi died of blood loss from the wound, which {{would probably have been}} fatal even if modern medical techniques had been available. Further research found that the arrow's shaft had been removed before death, and close examination of the body found bruises and cuts to the hands, wrists and chest and cerebral trauma indicative of a blow to the head. One of the cuts was to the base of his thumb that reached down to the bone but <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> heal before his death. Currently, it is believed that Ötzi bled to death after the arrow shattered the scapula and damaged nerves and blood vessels before lodging near the lung.|$|E
25|$|On Sunday, January 25, 2015, three platoons of {{the elite}} SAF police squad entered the guerrilla enclave of Tukanalipao, Mindanao, Philippines, {{with the goal of}} detaining two {{high-ranking}} Jemaah Islamiyah-affiliated, improvised-explosive-device experts, Zulkifli Abdhir (also known as Marwan) and Abdul Basit Usman. The SAF troops raided the hut where they believed Marwan was located, and the man they believe to be Marwan engaged them in a firefight and was killed. The SAF initially planned to take his body for identification. However, the shooting alerted the BIFF and MILF 118th Command in the area. The SAF <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> retrieve the body so they just cut off a finger, took a photo, and left his body there. By 6:18 AM UTC+8 (PST), an SMS message was sent by the Commander of SAF 61D Battalion to SAF Director Getulio Napeñas that they were pinned down at coordinates 6.92489°N 124.52047°E. What followed was a bloody encounter that left 44 SAF, 18 MILF, and 5 BIFF dead.|$|E
