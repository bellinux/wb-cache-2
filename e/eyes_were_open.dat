500|$|On April 3, 1989, as the Gores {{and their}} six-year-old son Albert were leaving a {{baseball}} game, Albert {{ran across the}} street to see his friend and was hit by a car. He was thrown , and then traveled along the pavement for another [...] Gore later recalled: [...] "I ran to his side and held him and called his name, but he was motionless, limp and still, without breath or pulse. His <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>open</b> with the nothingness stare of death, and we prayed, the two of us, there in the gutter, with only my voice." [...] Albert was tended to by two nurses who happened to be present during the accident. The Gores spent the next month in the hospital with Albert. Gore also commented: [...] "Our lives were consumed with the struggle to restore his body and spirit." [...] This event was [...] "a trauma so shattering that [...] views it as a moment of personal rebirth", a [...] "key moment in his life" [...] which [...] "changed everything." ...|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of day three, the spacecraft was about [...] away from the Earth. The velocity of the craft steadily decreased, as it had not yet reached the lunar sphere of gravitational influence. The early part of day three was largely housekeeping, spacecraft maintenance and exchanging status reports with Mission Control in Houston. The crew performed the Apollo light flash experiment, or ALFMED, to investigate [...] "light flashes" [...] that were seen by the astronauts when the spacecraft was dark, {{regardless of whether or}} not their <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>open,</b> on Apollo lunar flights. This was thought to be caused by the penetration of the eye by cosmic ray particles. During the second half of the day, Young and Duke again entered the Lunar Module to power it up and check its systems, and perform housekeeping tasks in preparation for lunar landing. The systems were found to be functioning as expected. Following this, the crew donned their space suits and rehearsed procedures that would be used on landing day. Just before the end of flight day three at 59 hours, 19 minutes, 45 seconds after liftoff, while [...] from the Earth and [...] from the Moon, the spacecraft's velocity began increasing as it accelerated towards the Moon after entering the lunar sphere of influence.|$|E
500|$|On 30 April, the Soviets {{were less}} than [...] from the bunker. That afternoon, Hitler and Eva Braun {{committed}} suicide fewer than 40 hours after they were married. Misch witnessed {{the discovery of the}} bodies of Hitler and Braun. He followed Otto Günsche and Hitler's chief valet Heinz Linge to the door of Hitler's private room. After the door was opened, Misch only took a quick [...] "glance". He saw Eva, with her legs drawn up, to Hitler's left on the sofa. Her <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>open</b> and she was dead. Hitler was also dead. He was either sitting on the sofa or in the armchair by it; his head [...] "had fallen forward slightly". Misch started to leave to report the events to Schädle, but then stopped and returned to the door of Hitler's study. By then Misch observed that Hitler's corpse had been removed from inside the study and wrapped in a blanket. Several men then picked it up and carried it past him. Misch left and reported the events to Schädle, who instructed him to return to his duty station. After returning to the telephone exchange, Misch later recalled Unterscharführer Retzbach proclaiming [...] "So they're burning the boss now!" [...] Retzbach asked Misch if he was going upstairs to watch the events, but Misch declined to go. Thereafter, Günsche came down and told Misch that the corpses of Hitler and Braun had been burned in the garden of the Reich Chancellery.|$|E
