60|$|VIII. In Plate XII. fig. 1 I {{have given}} a most {{singular}} instance both of rude execution and defied symmetry, in the little pillar and spandril from a panel decoration under the pulpit of St. Mark's at Venice. The imperfection (not merely simplicity, but actual rudeness and ugliness) of the leaf ornament will strike the eye at once: this is general in works of the time, {{but it is not}} so common to find a capital which has been so carelessly cut; its imperfect volutes being pushed up one side far higher than on the other, and contracted on that side, an additional drill hole being put in to fill the space; besides this, the member a, of the mouldings, is a roll where it follows the arch, and a <b>flat</b> <b>fillet</b> at a; the one being slurred into the other at the angle b, and finally stopped short altogether at the other side by the most uncourteous and remorseless interference of the outer moulding: and in spite of all this, the grace, proportion, and feeling of the whole arrangement are so great, that, in its place, it leaves nothing to be desired; all the science and symmetry in the world could not beat it. In fig. 4 I have endeavored to give some idea of the execution of the subordinate portions of a much higher work, the pulpit of St. Andrea at Pistoja, by Nicolo Pisano. It is covered with figure sculptures, executed with great care and delicacy; but when the sculptor came to the simple arch mouldings, he did not choose to draw the eye to them by over precision of work or over sharpness of shadow. The section adopted, k, m, is peculiarly simple, and so slight and obtuse in its recessions as never to produce a sharp line; and it is worked with what at first appears slovenliness, but it is in fact sculptural sketching; exactly correspondent to a painter's light execution of a background: the lines appear and disappear again, are sometimes deep, sometimes shallow, sometimes quite broken off; and the recession of the cusp joins that of the external arch at n, in the most fearless defiance of all mathematical laws of curvilinear contact.|$|E
60|$|XXVIII. There was, however, in {{this kind}} of involution, much to be admired as well as reprehended, the {{proportions}} of quantities were always as beautiful as they were intricate; and, though the lines of intersection were harsh, they were exquisitely opposed to the flower-work of the interposing mouldings. But the fancy did not stop here; it rose from the bases into the arches; and there, not finding room enough for its exhibition, it withdrew the capitals from the heads even of cylindrical shafts, (we cannot but admire, while we regret, the boldness of the men who could defy the authority and custom of all the nations of the earth for a space of some three thousand years,) in order that the arch mouldings might appear to emerge from the pillar, as at its base they had been lost in it, and not to terminate on the abacus of the capital; then they ran the mouldings across and through each other, at the point of the arch; and finally, not finding their natural directions enough to furnish as many occasions of intersection as they wished, bent them hither and thither, and cut off their ends short, when they had passed the point of intersection. Fig. 2, Plate IV. is part of a flying buttress from the apse of St. Gervais at Falaise, in which the moulding whose section is rudely given above at [=f], (taken vertically through the point f,) is carried thrice through itself, in the cross-bar and two arches; and the <b>flat</b> <b>fillet</b> is cut off sharp {{at the end of the}} cross-bar, for the mere pleasure of the truncation. Fig. 3 is half of the head of a door in the Stadthaus of Sursee, in which the shaded part of the section of the joint g g, is that of the arch-moulding, which is three times reduplicated, and six times intersected by itself, the ends being cut off when they become unmanageable. This style is, indeed, earlier exaggerated in Switzerland and Germany, owing to the imitation in stone of the dovetailing of wood, particularly of the intersecting of beams at the angles of châlets; but it only furnishes the more plain instance of the danger of the fallacious system which, from the beginning, repressed the German, and, in the end, ruined the French Gothic. It would be too painful a task to follow further the caricatures of form, and eccentricities of treatment, which grow out of this singular abuse--the flattened arch, the shrunken pillar, the lifeless ornament, the liny moulding, the distorted and extravagant foliation, until the time came when, over these wrecks and remnants, deprived of all unity and principle, rose the foul torrent of the renaissance, and swept them all away. So fell the great dynasty of mediæval architecture. It was because it had lost its own strength, and disobeyed its own laws--because its order, and consistency, and organization, had been broken through--that it could oppose no resistance to the rush of overwhelming innovation. And this, observe, all because it had sacrificed a single truth. From that one surrender of its integrity, from that one endeavor to assume the semblance of what it was not, arose the multitudinous forms of disease and decrepitude, which rotted away the pillars of its supremacy. It was not because its time was come; it was not because it was scorned by the classical Romanist, or dreaded by the faithful Protestant. That scorn and that fear it might have survived, and lived; it would have stood forth in stern comparison with the enervated sensuality of the renaissance; it would have risen in renewed and purified honor, and with a new soul, from the ashes into which it sank, giving up its glory, as it had received it, for the honor of God--but its own truth was gone, and it sank forever. There was no wisdom nor strength left in it, to raise it from the dust; and the error of zeal, and the softness of luxury smote it down and dissolved it away. It is good for us to remember this, as we tread upon the bare ground of its foundations, and stumble over its scattered stones. Those rent skeletons of pierced wall, through which our sea-winds moan and murmur, strewing them joint by joint, and bone by bone, along the bleak promontories on which the Pharos lights came once from houses of prayer--those grey arches and quiet isles under which the sheep of our valleys feed and rest on the turf that has buried their altars--those shapeless heaps, that are not of the Earth, which lift our fields into strange and sudden banks of flowers, and stay our mountain streams with stones that are not their own, have other thoughts to ask from us than those of mourning for the rage that despoiled, or the fear that forsook them. It was not the robber, not the fanatic, not the blasphemer, who sealed the destruction that they had wrought; the war, the wrath, the terror, might have worked their worst, and the strong walls would have risen, and the slight pillars would have started again, from under the hand of the destroyer. But they could not rise out of the ruins of their own violated truth.|$|E

5000|$|While Thomas {{had been}} battling for the Mosquito's future Issigonis had been {{settling}} the car's styling. Although {{in his later}} career he would be known for very functional designs Issigonis was heavily influenced by the modern styling of American cars, especially the Packard Clipper and the Buick Super. A new feature was a low-set headlamps, integral with the grille panel (Issigonis had originally sketched hidden lamps concealed behind sections of the grille, but these were never implemented). The original Mosquito prototype, which drew Lord Nuffield's [...] "poached egg" [...] comment, was designed with similar proportions to pre-war cars, being relatively narrow for its length. In late 1947, with Cowley already tooling up for production, Issigonis was unhappy {{with the appearance of}} the car. He had the prototype cut lengthways and the two halves moved apart until it looked [...] "right". The production model was thus four inches (10 cm) wider than the prototype and, in keeping with Issigonis' design principles, this further improved interior space and roadholding. It also gave the car distinctive (and recognisably modern) proportions - contrast with the Austin A30, launched in 1952 but still recognisably pre-war in size and proportions). The last-minute change to the design required a number of workarounds - bumpers had already been produced, so early cars had ones cut in half with a four-inch plate bolted between the join. The bonnet had a <b>flat</b> <b>fillet</b> section added to its centreline and the floorpan had two two-inch sections added either side of the transmission tunnel.|$|E
50|$|The {{facade of}} the meeting house faces west and is seven bays wide. Window sashes are 16-over-12, with muntin {{profiles}} typical of the Federal period. Exterior window casings are elaborated with <b>flat</b> <b>fillets</b> in place of backhand moldings. The front doorway, {{in the center of}} the facade, is a simple Greek Revival design which undoubtedly dates from 1844, when the structure was altered from its original use as a meeting house to a dual use as a town hall on the first floor and a chapel on the second. This doorway encloses two doors, each having five flat panels surrounded by applied Grecian ogee moldings. Above the doors is a five-light transom sash with thin muntins characteristic of the Greek Revival period. The door casings are wide flat boards with flat strips applied to their inner and outer edges and with flat square corner blocks at the juncture of side and top casings. The water table and corner boards of the building are simple square-edged planks. The front cornice of the meeting house consists of an ovolo bed molding and an ogee crown molding.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a numerical}} algorithm and supporting formulation for evaluating ultrasonic pulse transmission through non-planar component geometries. The algorithm is engineered to model experimental configurations where irregularities in surface geometry preclude {{the use of}} less rigorous approaches, such as a field expansion about a single entry point. The algorithm formulation represents the transmitted pulse as a surface integral coinciding with a pulse origin aperture, employing the Green function for the water-component system. The model explicitly considers the component surface geometry over the footprint of the incident pulse, thus allowing consideration of smooth yet non-expandable (i. e. in power series about a single point) geometries, such as adjoining <b>flat</b> and <b>fillet</b> surfaces. A computationally efficient algorithm results from use of asymptotic Green function approximations. Approaches are also discussed under conditions where the asymptotic Green function expressions are singular or invalid, due to focusing by surface concavity or transmission near critical angles. Consideration of pulse time dependence represents an extension of previous work [1], as also does treatment of surface concavity and critical angle transmission. The following sections summarize theoretical formulation and algorithmic implementation, followed by the presentation of illustrative computations...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{mastering}} 1 F (flat position-fillet) welds on carbon steel using a sequenced pattern of welding was examined. Participants (N = 71) {{were randomly assigned}} a specific sequence of welding between Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) and Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW). The hypothesis of teaching beginning welders the GMAW process before the SMAW process to improve the ability to master American Welding Society (AWS) welds was tested. A welding pretest was administered to determine any prior welding knowledge. Sixty minutes of welding instruction taught proper welding safety, machine set-up, arc length, travel speed, work angle, and correct bead formation. Two practice sessions of 60 minutes were given for participants {{to become familiar with}} each welding process, followed by two testing sessions of ten minutes. During the testing period, individuals were assessed on their ability to produce an AWS 1 F (<b>flat</b> position- <b>fillet)</b> lap weld in a given sequence. Welds were graded according to the AWS rubric for fillets with a total of four criteria categories based on the following criteria: a) presence of cracks or porosity, b) complete fusion, c) fillet leg size is specified minimum, and d) undercut - not to exceed 1 / 32 inches. The study indicate that students perform welds that meet AWS quality standards when using the GMAW process, however, the results were not statistically significant...|$|R
25|$|Like the Doric Order, the Ionic Order retains {{signs of}} having {{its origins in}} wooden architecture. The {{horizontal}} spread of a flat timber plate {{across the top of}} a column is a common device in wooden construction, giving a thin upright a wider area on which to bear the lintel, {{while at the same time}} reinforcing the load-bearing strength of the lintel itself. Likewise, the columns always have bases, a necessity in wooden architecture to spread the load and protect the base of a comparatively thin upright. The columns are fluted with narrow, shallow flutes that do not meet at a sharp edge but have a <b>flat</b> band or <b>fillet</b> between them. The usual number of flutes is twenty-four but there may be as many as forty-four. The base has two convex mouldings called torus, and from the late Hellenic period stood on a square plinth similar to the abacus.|$|R

40|$|Parametic {{investigations}} are performed using several two dimensional finite element formulations {{to determine their}} suitability for use in predicting extremum stresses in marine propellers. Comparisons are made of two NASTRAN elements (CTRIM 6 and CTRAIA 2) wherein elasticity properties have been modified to yield plane strain results.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the performance of adhesive joints of carbon/epoxy wind turbine blade subjected to combined bending and tension loadings through finite element method. The influence of adhesive material properties and geometrical details including fillet and imperfections was examined in terms of interlaminar stresses in the adhesive layer. The variation of stress intensity with change in adhesive shear modulus has also been investigated, while contour integral method was used for evaluating the stress intensity factors (SIF) at the imperfection tip. Furthermore, the strength of the joint was assessed through the crack initiation and propagation analysis. Results suggested that either adding a fillet or considering the plasticity led to the reduced peak stresses at the edge of the adhesive layer and redistributed the load to low stress regions. Inclusion of imperfections has resulted in high stress concentrations in the adhesive layer and reduction in the strength of the joint. Compared to the filleted adhesive, the strength of the joint reduced 2. 4 % and 4. 8 % considering a <b>flat</b> adhesive and <b>filleted</b> adhesive with through-thickness imperfection, respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT Parametric Modeling Program of Fillet End Mill Jiapu Zhu End-mill cutter is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used cutting tool in metal machining industry, especially <b>flat</b> end-mill and <b>fillet</b> end-mill, which provide significant influence on machining efficiency and quality. Nickel-based high temperature alloy is widely used in aerospace industry due to its excellent performance of mechanical property under rigorous situation. However, it possesses poor machinability and rEqires very high cutting force during milling process. In addition, vibration is another factor which should be taken into consideration. Variable pitch end-mill is one kind of end-mill cutters that have different parameters in pitch and flute. In this category of design, each integrated cutting feature, namely, bottom, fillet, side, flute and gash are different. Meanwhile, it also can reduces the vibration effectively. FEA simulation is a time saving and cost saving way in the field of cutting tool design and optimization. An efficient and accurate modeling method is demanded due to the complexity geometry of end-mill cutter. A lot of research was conducted on end-mill modeling previously. However, most of them focused on symmetric geometry end-mill and there were no introduction about gash modeling. Based on the above reasons, a feature-based modeling method with parametric design is proposed. According to the characteristic of end-mill and based on the mathematic Equations, each feature is designed and modeled individually. Constraints of gash are analyzed and applied. In addition, a customized program is developed with the combination of Visual Basic user interface and CATIA macro programing technique. Finally, a simulation example of the model is conducted to analyze the dynamics during cutting process...|$|R
