The extraction and stripping of copper (II) and gold (III) as thiourea complexes were investigated between the anionic surfactant of sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS) and aqueous phases. The combination of extraction and stripping steps exploiting {{the nature of the}} separated surfactant phases seems to be a reasonable alternative to traditional extraction procedures being used organic solvents. At the 1. 0 x 10 ^ mol dm^ the recoveries of copper (II) and gold (III) were 86 % and 5. 5 %, respectively.

40|$|Nanoscale {{observation}} of beetle's attachment systems has revealed various exquisite multiscale architectures for essential {{functions such as}} wing fixation, crawling, mating, and protection from predators. Some of these adhesion systems are mediated by liquid secretion (capillary force), whereas some are purely operated by direct interlocking of high-density microfibers or contact of mushroom-like hairy structures (van der Waals force). In this review, we present an overview of recent advances in beetle-inspired, artificial dry and wet adhesives {{in the context of}} nanofabrication and material properties. For convenience, the beetle's adhesions from wing to tiptoe are classified into four types: hair interlocking, mushroom-shaped pads, oil-assisted spatula-shaped pads, and claws. After introducing the structural features and functions of these systems, we describe how the current nanofabrication methods can be applied to mimic or exploit the systems. Furthermore, relevant beetle-inspired structural materials, devices (fastener, medical tape, <b>electric</b> <b>connector,</b> etc.) and microrobots are briefly overviewed, which would shed light on future smart, directional and reversible adhesion systems. close...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} a magnetic actuator {{for use in}} a separable <b>electric</b> <b>connector</b> based on conical airgap. The magnetic flux lines in conical airgap are almost vertical to the edge face of the yoke and armature, showing that the actual flux length in conical airgap is smaller than the axial stroke, which reduces magnetic reluctance over large stroke. Parameter improvement is analyzed based on modeling, and optimal results of the magnetic actuator are adopted to improve the rate of force to volume. The experimental results show that there is friction force of 10 â€“ 12 [*]N existing in the moving armature of the prototype, and the nominal value is in accordance with the simulation one. The results show that the design of conical airgap in the magnetic actuator is available to improve the initial force and reliability of the separating process and has the advantages of compact structure, short transmission, high reliability, large force with 50 [*]N at the initial displacement of 2. 5 [*]mm, and fast response with 16. 5 [*]ms over the traditional actuator...|$|E
40|$|The {{stainless}} steel bipolar plate has received much attention {{due to the}} cost of graphite bipolar plates. Since the micro-channel of bipolar plates plays the role of fuel flow field, <b>electric</b> <b>connector</b> and fuel sealing, an investigation of the deep drawing process for {{stainless steel}} micro-channel arrays is reported in this work. The updated Lagrangian formulation, degenerated shell finite element analysis, and the r-minimum rule have been employed to study the relationship between punch load and stroke, distributions of stress and strain, thickness variations and depth variations of individual micro-channel sections. A micro-channel array is practically formed, with a width and depth of a single micro-channel of 0. 75 mm and 0. 5 mm, respectively. Fractures were usually observed in the fillet corner of the micro-channel bottom. According to the experimental results, more attention should be devoted to the fillet dimension design of punch and die. A larger die fillet can lead to better formability and a reduction of the punch load. In addition, the micro-channel thickness and the fillet radius have to be taken into consideration at the same time. Finally, the punch load estimated by the unmodified metal forming equation is higher than that of experiments...|$|E
50|$|Since {{the brake}} line and <b>electric</b> <b>connectors</b> are {{integrated}} into the coupler's main body {{rather than in a}} separate body part below the main body, as had been the case on the AK69e type, it is possible to couple C-AKV equipped stock to stock not thus equipped.|$|R
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} coupled thermoelectromechanical {{model for}} electrical connectors is here proposed to evaluate local stress and temperature distributions around the contact area of <b>electric</b> <b>connectors</b> under different applied loads. A micromechanical numerical {{model has been}} developed by merging together the contact theory approach, which makes use of the so-called roughness parameters obtained from experimental measurements on real contact surfaces, with the topology description of the rough surface via the theory of fractal geometry. Particularly, the variation of asperities has been evaluated via the Weierstrass-Mandelbrot function. In this way the micromechanical model allowed for an upgraded contact algorithm in terms of effective contact area and thermal and electrical contact conductivities. Such an algorithm is subsequently implemented to construct a global model for performing transient thermoelectromechanical analyses without the need of simulating roughness asperities of contact surfaces, so reducing the computational cost. A comparison between numerical and analytical results shows that the adopted procedure is suitable to simulate the transient thermoelectromechanical response of <b>electric</b> <b>connectors...</b>|$|R

40|$|International {{standards}} {{are playing a}} crucially important role in all industries for rational production, international terminologies, safety and health protection, measurement, analysis, quality control and environmental protection, particularly in the energy field, where standards for the interfaces in energy flows are indispensable, such as <b>electric</b> <b>connectors,</b> fuelling devices, calibration methods and electrical safety. Of particular significance is the SI system of units and the OSI standards which allow the world-wide harmonization of data exchanges and computers. International standardization is shared between the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for all non-electric matters, founded just after World War II as the successor to ISA and the much older International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) both based in Geneva, Switzerland, in the same building. Besides the specific standards for petroleum, coal, nuclear and hydro-power, solar energy, wind-power, hydrogen and the vast field of electricity, the energy standards series ISO 13600 allows the characterization, analysis and comparison of all energy systems and soon will issue a global energy statistics and planning matrix for the transition to environmentally-sound sustainable economics. These standards allow integrated resource planning, including all new renewable options, such as the increasingly important direct and indirect solar energy, co-generation, hybrid systems, small decentralized units, bio-energy, ambient temperature use by heat pumps and substitutions of muscle-powered systems or vice versa, besides the more efficient production and use of conventional finite and renewable energy-sources.

50|$|In October 2012, Mennekes {{showed an}} {{optional}} shutter solution for its Type 2 socket. In the press material, it is shown that some countries chose the Mennekes' IEC Type 2 connector despite {{the requirement for}} shutters on household sockets (Sweden, Finland, Spain, Italy, UK); only France has a decision for the EV Plug Alliance's IEC Type 3 socket type. The Mennekes shutter is inherently IP 54 safe (dust cover) providing an installation option even beyond IP xxD. After the European Commission has settled on Type 2 (VDE/Mennekes connector) as the single solution for the charging infrastructure in Europe in January 2013, the EV Plug Alliance has asked to include the variant of Type 2 with shutters in the upcoming directive in a hearing of the TRAN Committee in June 2013 (which makes the VDE/Mennekes plug a variant implementation of the requirements of IEC Type 3). The Italian standardization body CEI tested the Mennekes shutter proposal (where Italy is a country requiring mechanical shutters) and in May 2013 the Italian and German partners approved it as a compromise solution for Type 2 {{to be included in}} the CENELEC standardization of <b>electric</b> vehicle charging <b>connectors.</b>|$|R
40|$|Construction of the International Space Station (ISS) {{will require}} {{extensive}} extravehicular activity (EVA, spacewalks), and {{estimates of the}} actual time needed continue to rise. As recently as September, 1996, {{the amount of time}} to be spent in EVA was believed to be about 400 hours, excluding spacewalks on the Russian segment. This estimate has recently risen to over 1100 hours, and it could go higher before assembly begins in the summer of 1998. These activities are extremely expensive and hazardous, so any design tools which help assure mission success and improve the efficiency of the astronaut in task completion can pay off in reduced design and EVA costs and increased astronaut safety. The tasks which astronauts can accomplish in EVA are limited by spacesuit mobility. They are therefore relatively simple, from an ergonomic standpoint, requiring gross movements rather than time motor skills. The actual tasks include driving bolts, mating and demating <b>electric</b> and fluid <b>connectors,</b> and actuating levers; the important characteristics to be considered in design improvement include the ability of the astronaut to see and reach the item to be manipulated and the clearance required to accomplish the manipulation. This makes the tasks amenable to simulation in a Computer-Assisted Design (CAD) environment. For EVA, the spacesuited astronaut must have his or her feet attached on a work platform called a foot restraint to obtain a purchase against which work forces may be actuated. An important component of the design is therefore the proper placement of foot restraints...|$|R
