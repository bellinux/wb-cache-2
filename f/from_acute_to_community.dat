40|$|The aim of {{this review}} {{is to provide a}} global {{perspective}} of Home Enteral Tube Feeding (HETF) and to outline some of the challenges of home enteral nutrition (HEN) provisions. It is well established that the number of patients on HETF is on the increase worldwide due to advances in technology, development of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy techniques, and the shift in care provisions <b>from</b> <b>acute</b> <b>to</b> <b>community</b> settings. While the significance of home enteral nutrition in meeting the nutritional requirements of patients with poor swallowing reflexes and those with poor nutritional status is not in doubt, differences exist in terms of funding, standards, management approaches and the level of infrastructural development across the world. Strategies for alleviating some of the challenges militating against the effective delivery of HETF including the development of national and international standards, guidelines and policies for HETF, increased awareness and funding by government at all levels were discussed. Others, including development of HEN services, which should create the enabling environment for multidisciplinary team work, clinical audit and research, recruitment and retention of specialist staff, and improvement in patient outcomes have been outlined. However, more research is required to fully establish the cost effectiveness of the HEN service especially in developing countries and to compare the organization of HEN service between developing and developed countries...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the changes to health and social care on enteral feeding in the community, outlines implications for practice and offers recommendations to ameliorate the challenges. It is now clear that there have been significant changes especially in the last 10 years in health and social care provisions in the UK with an overarching effect on enteral nutrition in the community. Advances in technology, increasing demand and treatment costs, the need for improvement in quality, economic challenges, market forces, political influences and more choices for patients are some of the factors driving the change. Government&# 8217;s vision of a modern system of health and social care is based on initiatives such as clinically led commissioning, establishment of Monitor, shifting care <b>from</b> <b>acute</b> hospitals <b>to</b> <b>community</b> settings, integrating health and social care provisions, Quality, Innovation, Productivity and Prevention (QIPP) program and the concept of &# 8220;Big Society&# 8221;.

40|$|Background: Health {{and social}} care {{services}} are under strain providing {{care in the}} community particularly at hospital discharge. Patient and carer experiences can inform and shape services. Objective: To develop service user-led recommendations enabling smooth transition for people living with memory loss <b>from</b> <b>acute</b> hospital <b>to</b> <b>community.</b> Design: Lead and co-researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 pairs of carers and patients with memory loss at discharge, 6 and 12 weeks post-discharge and one semi-structured interview with health and social care professionals and Admiral Nurses. Framework analysis was guided by co-researchers. Two focus groups of study participants, facilitated by co-researchers, met to shape and finalize recommendations. Setting and participants: Recruitment took place in acute hospitals in two National Health Service (NHS) Trusts in England. Patients were aged 65 and over, with memory loss, an in-patient for at least 1 week returning <b>to</b> the <b>community,</b> who had a carer consenting to be in the study. Results: Poor delivery of services caused considerable stress to some study families living with memory loss. Three key recommendations included a need for a written, mutually agreed discharge plan, a named coordinator of services, and improved domiciliary care services. Discussion and conclusions: Vulnerable patients with memory loss find coming out of hospital after an extended period a stressful experience.

The study aimed to investigate care transitions of frail older people <b>from</b> <b>acute</b> hospital wards <b>to</b> <b>community</b> healthcare or community hospital wards, within {{a system that}} had vertically integrated acute hospital and community healthcare services. Theory and methods: The research design was a multimethod, qualitative case study of one healthcare system in England; four acute hospital wards and two community hospital wards were studied in depth. The data were collected through: interviews with key staff (n = 17); focus groups (n = 9) with ward staff (n = 36); interviews with frail older people (n = 4). The data were analysed using the framework approach. Findings: Three themes are presented: Care transitions within a vertically integrated healthcare system, Interprofessional communication and relationships; Patient and family involvement in care transitions. Discussion and conclusions: A vertically integrated healthcare system supported care transitions <b>from</b> <b>acute</b> hospital wards through removal of organisational boundaries. However, boundaries between staff in different settings remained a barrier to transitions, as did capacity issues in community healthcare and social care.

40|$|Background Health care {{professionals}} {{in several countries}} are searching for alternatives <b>to</b> <b>acute</b> hospitalization. In Hallingdal, Norway, selected acute patients are admitted <b>to</b> a <b>community</b> hospital. The {{aim of this study}} was <b>to</b> analyse whether <b>acute</b> admission <b>to</b> a <b>community</b> hospital as an alternative to a general hospital had any positive or negative health consequences for the patients. Methods Patients intended for <b>acute</b> admission <b>to</b> the local <b>community</b> hospital were asked to join a randomized controlled trial. One group of the enrolled patients was admitted as planned (group 1, n[*]=[*] 33), while another group was admitted to the general hospital (group 2, n[*]=[*] 27). Health outcomes were measured by the Nottingham Extended Activity of Daily Living Questionnaire and by collection of data concerning specialist and community health care services in a follow-up year. Results After one year, no statistical significant differences in the level of daily function was found between group 1 (admissions <b>to</b> the <b>community</b> hospital) and group 2 (admissions to the general hospital). Group 1 had recorded fewer in-patient days at hospitals and nursing homes, as well as lower use of home nursing, than group 2. For outpatient referrals, the trend was the opposite. However, {{the differences between the two}} groups were not at a 5 % level of statistical significance. Conclusions No statistical significant differences at a 5 % level were found related to health consequences between the two randomized groups.

Poor communication in a patient’s discharge can result in post hospital adverse events, readmission, and mortality. Because of the gravity of these problems, discharge planning has been emphasized as a potential solution. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to identify communication barriers to effective discharge planning in an acute care unit of a tertiary care center and to suggest solutions to these barriers. Methods: Health care providers provided comments to a single open-ended question: “What are the communication barriers between the different health care providers that limit an effective discharge of patients from Unit 36 ?” We conducted qualitative thematic analysis by identifying themes related to communication barriers affecting a successful discharge process. Results: Three broad themes related to barriers to the discharge process were identified: communication, lack of role clarity and lack of resources. We also identified two themes for opportunities for improvement, ie, structure and function of the medical team and need for leadership. Conclusion: While it was evident that poor communication was an overarching barrier identified by health care providers, other themes emerged. In an effort to increase inter-team communication, “bullet rounds”, a condensed form of discharge rounds, were introduced to the medical teaching unit and occurred on a daily basis between the multidisciplinary team. To help facilitate provider-patient communication, electronic transfer of care summaries were suggested as a potential solution. To help role clarity, a discharge coordinator and/or liaison was suggested. Communication can be enhanced through use of electronic discharge summaries, bullet rounds, and implementation of a discharge coordinator(s). The findings from this study can be used to aid future researchers in devising appropriate discharging strategies that are focused around the patient and inter-health care provider communication.

40|$|Aim: This thesis aimed <b>to</b> explore <b>community</b> nursing middle manager role {{enactment}} {{in managing}} change within Community Health Partnerships (CHPs) in three regions of Scotland from 2008 - 2011. Background: CHPs were established {{to play a}} key role in shifting care <b>from</b> the <b>acute</b> <b>to</b> the <b>community</b> setting. Within this context the community nursing workforce has been adapting roles in response to Scottish Government (SG) directives. However literature review demonstrated there has been very little research into the role of Community Nurse Middle Managers (CNMMs) in the midst of this change. This investigation sought to address this deficit in the literature. Design and Methodology: The study was conducted in four distinct phases comprising of the reflexive, foundational, recursive and expansive. A total of 42 semi-structured interviews were conducted over the period of investigation. The investigation was qualitative and phenomenological in character. A hermeneutic approach was adopted, broadly based on Heideggerian philosophy. More specifically this study drew on the Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) approach of Jonathan Smith (1996). Main findings: In general CNMMs perceived that their jobs had become more complex, with the pace and intensity of work having increased. They held a wide range of responsibilities managing the challenges of driving change within a hierarchy and professional bureaucracy. Opportunities for education and learning were felt to have reduced. A small but significant proportion had left and some were considering leaving the NHS service. A primary motivation for CNMMs was maintaining an implicit connection with service users. They were proud to be members of the nursing profession and aligned their identity with their career history. This was perceived to influence their management and leadership style. In overcoming some of the personal challenges they faced they identified protective factors or “assets” to counteract stress. The application of a salutogenic perspective emerged as important in supporting this. Conclusion: The study has addressed a knowledge gap in literature. It contributes to understandings of NHS community nursing, middle management, role, change and Community Health Partnership literature. In particular it gives a voice to the perspectives of community nursing middle managers in Scotland. It suggests that much more attention needs to be paid to the needs, constitution and sustenance of middle managers in Scottish community nursing and that this has policy, practice, education and research implications.

In the present study, the association between insomnia and first-onset depression was evaluated taking into account these considerations. DESIGN: A mixed-model inception design. SETTING: Academic research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-four individuals (acute insomnia [n = 33], normal sleepers [n = 21]) with no reported history of a sleep disorder, chronic medical condition, or psychiatric illness. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Participants were assessed at baseline (2 nights of polysomnography and psychometric measures of stress and mood) and insomnia and depression status were reassessed at 3 months. Individuals with acute insomnia exhibited more stress, poorer mood, worse subjective sleep continuity, increased N 2 sleep, and decreased N 3 sleep. Individuals who transitioned to chronic insomnia exhibited (at baseline) shorter REM latencies and reduced N 3 sleep. Individuals who exhibited this pattern in the transition <b>from</b> <b>acute</b> <b>to</b> chronic insomnia {{were also more likely to}} develop first-onset depression (9. 26 %) as compared to those who remitted from insomnia (1. 85 %) or were normal sleepers (1. 85 %).

40|$|Chronic lung {{infections are}} {{associated}} with increased morbidity and mortality for individuals with underlying respiratory conditions such as cystic fibrosis (CF) and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). The process of chronic colonisation allows pathogens to adapt over time to cope with changing selection pressures, co-infecting species and antimicrobial therapies.

Phenotypic adaptations in bacterial pathogens <b>from</b> <b>acute</b> <b>to</b> chronic infection include, but are not limited to, antibiotic resistance, exopolysaccharide production (mucoidy), loss in motility, formation of small colony variants, increased mutation rate, quorum sensing and altered production of virulence factors associated with chronic infection.

40|$|Pain is an {{important}} self-protecting signal. The pain system detects and reacts to (withdrawal reflex) {{the presence of an}} acute potentially injurious stimulus such as heat, pressure, tissue damage or inflammation to avoid possible (further) tissue damage. However, after inflammation or tissue damage has resolved, persistent pain can develop without further protective or restorative goal. Persistent or chronic pain has become a major health problem in many countries, especially because there is no effective medication available to prevent or combat chronic pain states. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the transition <b>from</b> <b>acute</b> <b>to</b> chronic pain is therefore of great importance. In this thesis I mainly focused on the investigation of neurobiological mechanisms underlying transition <b>from</b> <b>acute</b> <b>to</b> chronic inflammation-induced pain. We described that G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK 2) {{plays a key role in}} regulating the transition <b>from</b> <b>acute</b> <b>to</b> chronic inflammation-induced pain. Furthermore, we found that the GRK 2 levels in a specific cell subtype, the peripheral monocytes/macrophages, are crucial to promote resolution of inflammation-induced pain. Mice with a 50 % reduction of GRK 2 in macrophages (LysM-GRK 2 +/-) develop persistent pain (> 8 days) after a single intraplantar injection of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL- 1 b, while in control WT mice the pain was resolved within one day. Moreover, depletion of peripheral monocytes/macrophages caused transition <b>from</b> <b>acute</b> <b>to</b> persistent IL- 1 b-induced pain WT mice. This finding indicates that monocytes/macrophages are key to preventing the transition to chronic pain after a transient peripheral inflammatory stimulus. Chronic pain will be maintained by the activation of microglia cells in the spinal cord. The prolonged pain response in LysM-GRK 2 +/- mice was prevented by an intrathecal injection and reversible by an intraperitoneal injection of the microglia/macrophage inhibitor minocycline, indicating a contribution of spinal cord and/or dorsal root ganglion (DRG) microglia/macrophages in the transition to persistent pain. Furthermore, in this thesis we identified several other compounds that can prevent or treat chronic pain. Finally we performed a genetic research to investigate DNA polymorphism in genes that can be responsible for the development of chronic pain. We identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) nearby two different genes (FAM 173 b and CCT 5) in patients with “chronic widespread pain (CWP) ” compared to healthy controls. Interestingly, we found an upregulation of FAM 173 b and CCT 5 in the spinal cord during inflammatory- induced chronic pain in mice. This could be a clinic relevant finding, since those two genes can be identified as new targets to treat chronic pain...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Low {{back pain}} (LBP) {{is by far}} the most {{prevalent}} and costly musculoskeletal problem in our society today. Following the recommendations of the Multinational Musculoskeletal Inception Cohort Study (MMICS) Statement, our study aims to define outcome assessment tools for patients with acute LBP and the time point at which chronic LBP becomes manifest and to identify patient characteristics which increase the risk of chronicity. Methods Patients with acute LBP will be recruited from clinics of general practitioners (GPs) in New Zealand (NZ) and Switzerland (CH). They will be assessed by postal survey at baseline and at 3, 6, 12 weeks and 6 months follow-up. Primary outcome will be disability as measured by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI); key secondary endpoints will be general health as measured by the acute SF- 12 and pain as measured on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). A subgroup analysis of different assessment instruments and baseline characteristics will be performed using multiple linear regression models. This study aims to examine 1. Which biomedical, psychological, social, and occupational outcome assessment tools are identifiers for the transition <b>from</b> <b>acute</b> <b>to</b> chronic LBP and at which time point this transition becomes manifest 2. Which psychosocial and occupational baseline characteristics like work status and period of work absenteeism influence the course <b>from</b> <b>acute</b> <b>to</b> chronic LBP 3. Differences in outcome assessment tools and baseline characteristics of patients in NZ compared with CH. Discussion This study will develop a screening tool for patients with <b>acute</b> LBP <b>to</b> be used in GP clinics to access the risk of developing chronic LBP. In addition, biomedical, psychological, social, and occupational patient characteristics which influence the course <b>from</b> <b>acute</b> <b>to</b> chronic LBP will be identified. Furthermore, an appropriate time point for follow-ups will be given to detect this transition. The generalizability of our findings will be enhanced by the international perspective of this study.

3000|$|Severe AKI is {{a serious}} {{complication}} in critically ill patients and {{is associated with a}} high short-term mortality rate. Moreover, even mild and transient episodes of AKI appear to increase the long-term risks of chronic and end-stage renal disease and cardiovascular morbidity among survivors. Finally, evolution <b>from</b> <b>acute</b> <b>to</b> such chronic renal conditions likely explains the extremely high 5 -year mortality seen in AKI patients as well as the reduced QoL in survivors after severe AKI. These findings suggest [...]...|$|R
