5|$|Whereas Linnaeus {{classified}} {{for ease}} of identification, {{the idea of the}} Linnaean taxonomy as translating into a sort of <b>dendrogram</b> of the Animal- and Plant Kingdoms was formulated {{toward the end of the}} 18th century, well before On the Origin of Species was published. Among early works exploring the idea of a transmutation of species were Erasmus Darwin's 1796 Zoönomia and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's Philosophie Zoologique of 1809. The idea was popularised in the Anglophone world by the speculative but widely read Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, published anonymously by Robert Chambers in 1844.|$|E

40|$|Mean {{similarity}} <b>dendrograms</b> {{are introduced}} {{as a new}} graphical tool for evaluating classifications, based on sample data from replicate objects {{within each of the}} proposed classes. The <b>dendrograms</b> compare the mean similarities between objects within the same class to the mean similarity between objects in different classes. They were designed to complement multidimensional scaling plots and permutation tests of class structure. The <b>dendrograms</b> offer a concise picture of the overall strength of a classification as well as the compactness and isolation of individual classes. Although broadly applicable, the <b>dendrograms</b> were motivated by a need for easily-communicated assessments of land classifications that are intended to serve as geographic frameworks for environmental research and management. The <b>dendrograms</b> and other similarity-based tools are applied to a single-factor classification of fish communities sampled along a 281 -km section of the Willamette River in Oregon, USA. In a second example, the tools are used to evaluate a two-factor classification of fish communities sampled in wadeable streams of Oregon's Cascade Mountains and Willamette Valley. The <b>dendrograms</b> help to assess the relative classification strengths of the two factors, factor interactions, and an alternative classification derived from cluster analysis.

40|$|The present {{manuscript}} aims at identifying {{patterns of}} electrical activity recorded from neurons of the leech nervous system, characterizing specific behaviors. When leeches are at rest, the electrical activity of neurons and motoneurons is poorly correlated. When leeches move their head and/or tail, in contrast, action potential (AP) firing becomes highly correlated. When {{the head or}} tail suckers detach, specific patterns of electrical activity are detected. During elongation and contraction the electrical activity of motoneurons in the Medial Anterior and Dorsal Posterior nerves increase respectively and several motoneurons are activated both during elongation and contraction. During crawling, swimming and pseudo-swimming patterns of electrical activity are better described by the <b>dendrograms</b> of cross-correlations of motoneurons pairs. <b>Dendrograms</b> obtained from different animals exhibiting the same behavior are similar and by averaging these <b>dendrograms</b> we obtained a template underlying a given behavior. By using this template, the corresponding behavior is reliably identified from the recorded electrical activity. The analysis of <b>dendrograms</b> during different leech behavior reveals the fine orchestration of motoneurons firing specific to each stereotyped behavior. Therefore, <b>dendrograms</b> capture the subtle changes in the correlation pattern of neuronal networks when they become involved in different tasks or functions...|$|R
40|$|<b>Dendrograms</b> {{are a way}} to {{represent}} evolutionary relationships between organisms. Nowadays, these are inferred based on the comparison of genes or protein sequences by taking into account their differences and similarities. The genetic material of choice for the sequence alignments (all the genes or sets of genes) results in distinct inferred <b>dendrograms.</b> In this work, we evaluate differences between <b>dendrograms</b> reconstructed with different methodologies and obtained for different sets of organisms chosen at random from a much larger set. A statistical analysis is performed in order to estimate the fluctuation between the results obtained from the different methodologies. This analysis permit us to validate a systematic approach, based on the comparison of the organisms' metabolic networks for inferring <b>dendrograms.</b> It has the advantage that it allows the comparison of organisms very far away in the evolutionary tree {{even if they have}} no known ortholog gene in common.

40|$|In the {{previous}} three reports in this series we demonstrated that the EF-hand family of proteins evolved by a complex pattern of gene duplication, transposition, and splicing. The <b>dendrograms</b> based on exon sequences are nearly identical to those based on protein sequences for troponin C, the essential light chain myosin, the regulatory light chain, and calpain. This validates both the computational methods and the <b>dendrograms</b> for these subfamilies. The proposal of congruence for calmodulin, troponin C, essential light chain, and regulatory light chain was confirmed. There are, however, {{significant differences in the}} calmodulin <b>dendrograms</b> computed from DNA and from protein sequences. In this study we find that introns are distributed throughout the EF-hand domain and the interdomain regions. Further, <b>dendrograms</b> based on intron type and distribution bear little resemblance to those based on protein or on DNA sequences. We conclude that introns are inserted, and probably deleted, with relatively high frequency. Further, in the EF-hand family exons do not correspond to structural domains and exon shuffling played little if any role in the evolution of this widely distributed homolog family. Calmodulin has had a turbulent evolution. Its <b>dendrograms</b> based on protein sequence, exon sequence, 3 '-tail sequence, intron sequences, and intron positions all show significant differences...|$|R

Vegetation patterns are represented by distance matrices and <b>dendrograms.</b> The significance of the relation between the patterns is evaluated through permutation (Mantel) tests and full randomization (Monte Carlo simulation) tests. The relationship between the two layers is significant but weak. When using ecological indicators as variables for characterising the herb layer, the relation is stronger. Distance matrices and <b>dendrograms</b> describe the vegetation pattern similarly. However, the results of pairwise tests of significance strongly depend on the “level” of comparisons, i. e., whether distance matrices or <b>dendrograms</b> are compared.

In this study we have computed <b>dendrograms</b> within and among the EF-hand subfamilies using the encoding DNA sequences. In most instances the <b>dendrograms</b> based on protein and on DNA sequences are very similar. Significant differences between protein and DNA trees for calmodulin remain unexplained.

We test the null hypothesis stating that the two <b>dendrograms</b> under comparison are not more similar than <b>dendrograms</b> randomly generated in terms of three different aspects: topology, leaf positions, fusion level positions. The similarity beween nested trees is computed using a normalized form of the intermediate consensus index of Faith and Belbin (1986).

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that Mutual Information (MI) <b>dendrograms</b> of influenza A viruses reflect informational groups generated during viral evolutionary processes is put forward.

No matter how diverse the RNA sequences are, MI <b>dendrograms</b> crisply discern actual viral subtypes together with gain and/or losses of information that occur during viral evolution. The amount of information during a century of evolution of RNA segments of influenza A is measured in terms of bits of information for both human and avian strains.
