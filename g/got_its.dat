Humphrey also recognized that city police officers operating under racial and ethnic prejudice were causing urban unrest, so he instructed the city's police chief to have officers in minority neighborhoods keep in contact with clergy, teachers, business owners, and other neighborhood leaders. This helped to redefine the issue of prejudice and <b>got</b> <b>its</b> attention as a problem that could be solved, not just {{a fact of life}} that had to be taken for granted.|$|E
