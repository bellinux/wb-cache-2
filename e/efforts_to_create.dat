Previous <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a second South Park film were complicated due to both studios retaining certain rights to the property.|$|E

5|$|In spring 1907, Ethel Hedgeman led <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a sisterhood at Howard University. Howard {{faculty member}} Ethal Robinson {{encouraged}} Hedgeman by relating her own observances of sorority {{life at the}} Women's College at Brown University, {{even though she was}} not a member of any sorority while a student at Brown. Hedgeman was also inspired by her mentors at Howard. To implement her idea, Hedgeman began recruiting interested classmates during the summer of 1907.|$|E
5|$|The {{perceived}} {{shortcomings of}} the mass housing movement led to <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> cost-effective housing solutions that were more varied, more integrated with natural surroundings, and above all more customized to families' needs. In 1973, the Parliament of Norway recommended a shift toward small residential houses rather than large apartment buildings. The Norwegian State Housing Bank (Husbanken) provided citizens {{with the ability to}} fund construction of their homes, and an entire construction industry formed to build these needs.|$|E
5|$|After graduation, Kerst {{worked at}} General Electric Company for a year, {{working on the}} {{development}} of x-ray tubes and machines. He found this frustrating, as x-ray research required high energies that could not be produced at the time. In 1938 he accepted an offer of an instructorship at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, where the head of the physics department, F. Wheeler Loomis encouraged Kerst in his <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a better particle accelerator. The result of these efforts was the betatron. When it became operational on July 15, 1940, Kerst became the first person to accelerate electrons using electromagnetic induction, reaching energies of 2.3 MeV.|$|E

5|$|Higher-speed rail (HrSR), {{also known}} as {{high-performance}} rail, higher-performance rail, or almost-high-speed rail, is a jargon used to describe inter-city passenger rail services that have top speeds of more than conventional rail but are not high enough to be called high-speed rail services. The term is also used by planners to identify the incremental rail improvements to increase train speeds and reduce travel time as alternatives to larger <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> or expand the high-speed rail networks. Some countries use the term medium-speed rail, or semi-high speed rail instead.|$|E
5|$|Rowell was {{promoted}} to colonel on 13 October 1939, and when the government decided to form I Corps in April 1940, Blamey was given the command and Rowell became brigadier, general staff (BGS), with the rank of brigadier. Blamey and Rowell prepared I Corps for operations as best they could, completing the force's structure and integrating new units as they arrived in the Middle East. Rowell strove to establish {{good relations with the}} British Army, while occasionally having to remind them that the AIF was answerable to its own commander in chief and its own government. Rowell's <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> an administrative headquarters to free the I Corps staff for operational duties foundered on Blamey's reluctance to delegate authority. The best that he could achieve was the creation of a Base and Line of Communications Units command under Brigadier Allan Boase but I Corps remained responsible for organisation and training.|$|E
5|$|The Puerto Rican government's Departments of Family, Education, and Health {{have since}} {{combined}} <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a 5-year strategic plan {{to improve the}} program's long-term performance and financial management. The Family Department has recently implemented a quality control-like program titled Measure of Efforts and Results System, which evaluates the quality and promptitude of services while reviewing various eligibility elements, to improve customer services and program management. The Department has also agreed to switch from a biennial audit to an annual Single Audit, and subject the program to periodic audits by its Administration for Socio-Economic Development, to detect and correct problems more quickly. Furthermore, the USDA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) has performed regular audits to assure compliance and identify areas for improvement.|$|E

5|$|After the war, {{federal highway}} {{subsidies}} and postwar development encouraged outward migration as residents moved to gain newer housing; this suburbanization significantly reduced the city's middle-class population. The city made <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> new attractions, {{such as the}} Gateway Arch, which construction became a focus {{of the civil rights}} movement to gain non-segregated jobs in the skilled trades. The first litigation under the 1964 Civil Rights Act was against St. Louis unions. The city worked to replace substandard housing by new public housing projects such as PruittIgoe. A combination of factors resulted in this being notoriously unsuccessful, and it was demolished in the late 20th century. Starting in the 1980s and continuing into the following century, construction and gentrification have increased in some areas of St. Louis, particularly downtown. City beautification and crime reduction have made progress, although St. Louis has continued to struggle with crime and perceptions of crime. The city saw modest population growth during the mid-2000s, but showed a decline in the 2010 U.S. Census.|$|E
