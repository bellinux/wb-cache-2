40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) {{are one of}} {{the most}} interesting nanomaterials because of their excellent characteristics. In this study, a transparent CNTs coating for cell culture <b>dishes</b> <b>was</b> developed and its properties for cell culture were estimated. Carboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were dispersed in aqueous sodium cholate solution and applied on a collagen type I-coated cell culture dish (cover glass). The <b>dish</b> surface <b>was</b> homogeneously covered by MWCNTs without aggregation. The MWCNT-coated <b>dish</b> <b>was</b> slightly gray and had good transparency, so conventional optical microscopic observation of the cells on the MWCNT-coated <b>dish</b> <b>was</b> possible. Rat osteoblast-like cells cultured on the MWCNT-coated dish showed slightly lower viability and proliferation compared to the collagen-coated dish. The cell adhesion on the MWCNT-coated <b>dish</b> <b>was</b> much higher than that on the collagen-coated dish. Therefore, MWCNT-coating for <b>dishes</b> will <b>be</b> a useful new material for cell culture. ...|$|R
