5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{decides to}} motivate and inspire {{everyone}} by taking {{them on a}} field trip to Gettysburg. At Gettysburg, Andy is unhappy with the lack of morale and belief in his leadership and attempts to make an analogy between running a paper company and fighting in the Civil War. Andy starts to lead a haphazard tour, and eventually most of the office members sit down to rest. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) follow Andy after he presses on, and eventually tell him to stop trying to impress the office. They reinforce the fact that his co-workers like <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he is.|$|E
5|$|The Hindu scriptures stress Rati's {{beauty and}} sensuality. They depict {{her as a}} maiden who {{has the power to}} enchant the god of love. When the god Shiva burnt her husband to ashes, it was Rati, whose beseeching or penance, leads to the promise of Kama's resurrection. Often, this resurrection occurs when Kama is reborn as Pradyumna, the son of Krishna. Rati – under the name of Mayavati – plays a {{critical}} role in the upbringing of Pradyumna, who is separated from his parents at birth. She acts as his nanny, as well as his lover, and tells <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to return to his parents by slaying the demon-king, who is destined to die at his hands. Later, Kama-Pradyumna accepts Rati-Mayavati as his wife.|$|E
5|$|Gray was {{a leading}} {{opponent}} of the Scientific Lazzaroni, a group of mostly physical scientists who wanted American academia to mimic the autocratic academic structures of European universities. A {{large percentage of the}} original 50 members of the National Academy of Sciences were Lazzaroni members. The American Academy of Arts and Sciences was opposed to the National Academy and collectively elected Gray and his friend, colleague, and fellow Charles Darwin supporter William Barton Rogers to the National Academy. Rogers founded the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This is one of the areas where Gray and his friend and colleague, Louis Agassiz, were in disagreement; Agassiz {{was a member of the}} Lazzaroni group. Agassiz had come to lecture at the Lowell Institute in 1846 and got hired by Harvard in 1847. Gray befriended <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he had been befriended during his trip to Europe.|$|E

5|$|The next day, Peggy visits Stacey in {{hospital}} and asks her {{to confess to}} burning the pub, as a sentence for arson would be less than one for murder, but Stacey refuses. Peggy realises that Stacey needs to look after her daughter so she leaves. Ryan confronts Stacey at the hospital, shocked with her confession, refuses to acknowledge his daughter, and goes on his honeymoon with Janine. Peggy goes into the pub and looks around as she remembers events from her time there. She then tells Billy she wants to take Phil away to make a fresh start and to protect him. Her niece Ronnie (Samantha Womack) tells Peggy she is five months pregnant and asks Peggy not to leave as she is like a mother to her. Peggy tells Ronnie to give her real mother, Glenda (Glynis Barber), another chance. Peggy's daughter Sam (Danniella Westbrook) does not want her to leave as Peggy promised to look after Sam's baby Richard for her, however, Peggy says she is old now and the baby needs a strong mother. Peggy gives her jewellery to Sam to sell so she has some money. Peggy speaks to Phil, accepting responsibility for making <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he is and offering {{to help him get}} off the drugs. He says she needs him more than he needs her and that she suffocates him. Realising that he is right, Peggy asks the rest of her family to look after him, saying emotional goodbyes. Though Phil claims not to have meant what he said, Peggy says she has to leave for his sake. As she leaves the house, Phil begins to follow her, but she sends him back inside. She looks at the pub and walks out of Walford.|$|E

25|$|Having fought {{so hard to}} make Ismail II shah of the Safavid dynasty, Pari Khan Khanum was now {{met with}} lack of {{gratitude}} from <b>him.</b> <b>The</b> <b>way</b> she was treated by Ismail II made her hostile towards him, and made her prepare to exact vengeance. On 25 November 1577, Ismail II died abruptly and without any initial signs of bad health. The court doctors, who checked the corpse, surmised {{that he may have}} died from poison. The general agreement was that Pari Khan Khanum had resolved to have poisoned {{with the help of the}} mistresses of the inner harem in retaliation for his bad behaviour towards her. With Ismail II out of the way, Pari Khan Khanum regained her authority and control. Every state grandee, clan chieftains, officers and officials carried out the orders delivered by her deputies and served according to her word.|$|E
25|$|Stone {{was from}} the West Indies and had been banished from Boston for malfeasance, {{including}} drunkenness, adultery, and piracy. He was known to have powerful connections in other colonies, {{as well as in}} London, and he was expected to use them against the Boston colony. Setting sail from Boston, Stone abducted two Western Niantic men, forcing them to show <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> up the Connecticut River. Soon after, he and his crew were suddenly attacked and killed by a larger group of Western Niantic. The initial reactions in Boston varied from indifference to outright joy at Stone's death, but the colonial officials later decided to protest the killing. They did not accept the Pequots' excuses that they had been unaware of Stone's nationality. Pequot sachem Sassacus sent some wampum to atone for the killing, but refused the colonists' demands that the warriors responsible for Stone's death be turned over to them for trial and punishment.|$|E
25|$|On {{the first}} night of the quest, the entire company is {{captured}} by three trolls, who plan to eat them. However, Gandalf arrives, imitating the trolls' voices and causing them to fight amongst themselves until the sun rises, which turns them to stone. As Bilbo searches for supplies in their cave, he meets an injured elf, Lianna (Jennifer Hale), who he assists by finding her healing potion. He also finds a dagger, which he calls Sting. The party then move on to the Elven city of Rivendell, where Elrond tells them of a secret entrance into the Lonely Mountain. They then head to the Misty Mountains. During the night, they are attacked by goblins, and Bilbo is knocked unconscious. He awakens alone and lost. As he wanders through the underground passages, he finds a ring, and encounters a creature named Gollum (Daran Norris). Gollum makes a deal with Bilbo; they will play a game of riddles. If Gollum wins, he will eat Bilbo, but if Bilbo wins, Gollum will show <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> out. Bilbo wins the game, and Gollum says he must get something before he can lead Bilbo out. He then realizes his ring is gone. Bilbo puts the ring on and discovers it makes its wearer invisible. An infuriated Gollum runs to the exit to try to stop Bilbo leaving, unwittingly leading the invisible Bilbo out. He reunites with the dwarves and Gandalf, but the party are then attacked by a groups of goblins and wargs. They climb to the tops of the trees, and are rescued by a band of eagles, who drop them off near Mirkwood Forest.|$|E

Like Hadley, Martha was a St. Louis native, and like Pauline, she had worked for Vogue in Paris. Of Martha, Kert explains, [...] "she never catered to <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> other women did". Late in 1937, while in Madrid with Martha, Hemingway wrote his only play, The Fifth Column, as the city was being bombarded by Francoist forces. He returned to Key West for a few months, then back to Spain twice in 1938, where he {{was present at the}} Battle of the Ebro, the last republican stand, and he was among the British and American journalists who were some of the last to leave the battle as they crossed the river.|$|E
500|$|PopMatters Brice Ezell {{called the}} song a [...] "hat trick" [...] {{on the album}} and also {{described}} {{it as one of}} its most [...] "weirdest" [...] and [...] "successful" [...] moments. According to <b>him,</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Timberlake lists the beverages in the lyrics it's an unorthodox style for the singer and in addition it differs musically {{from the rest of the}} material on the album, however, [...] "for whatever reason, though, it works". He also noted that the song would suit better on a Montgomery Gentry LP. Kory Grow of Rolling Stone described it as a [...] "a big genre-bending, feel-good sing-along that really actually does feels good." [...] Jason King for Spin called the song [...] "organ-laced" [...] and thought it was [...] "a surefire hit, a country twanger lifted to heaven by Timberlake’s quilted, hermetic harmonies." ...|$|E
500|$|Lasance {{explained}} that {{a common theme}} in Aden's life is something bad happening just after each time he rebuilds his life. One such bad event is the re-emergence of his alcoholic father, Larry. His arrival sets Aden [...] "on the back foot" [...] again, as most of Aden's childhood issues stemmed from his father's addiction to alcohol. He also {{explained that}} alcohol abuse is often seen in victims of abuse, so Aden is angered when Larry admits Aden's grandfather abused him too. [...] "Aden loses it" [...] with Larry, because he has had his last chance in Aden's view. Aden holds his father hostage and withdraws his medication to punish him. Aden has had so much trouble from Larry that those [...] "experiences have made <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he is now", and the story comes to a culmination with Aden giving up on his father. Aden is admitted into psychiatric care after the incident. However he initially makes little progress and prefers to help fellow patient Melody Jones (Celeste Dodwell) with her treatment. Lasance said that Aden had been [...] "protective of Melody after Axel Hay (Trent Dalzell) took advantage of her." [...] The pair share an [...] "unspoken bond" [...] because of their past experiences and he [...] "understands exactly what she's going through." ...|$|E

When Frank Wells died in a helicopter crash in 1994, Michael Eisner refused to promote Katzenberg to the vacated position of president. Eisner recalled that [...] "Roy , who did not like him at all — I forget the reason, but Jeffrey probably did not treat <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that Roy would have wanted to be treated — said to me, 'If you make him the president, I will start a proxy fight.'" [...] Tensions between Katzenberg, Eisner and Disney resulted in Katzenberg's resignation from the company that October.

2500|$|Some of Adams's {{compositions}} are an amalgamation {{of different}} styles. One example is Grand Pianola Music (1981–82), a humorous piece that purposely draws its content from musical cliches. In The Dharma at Big Sur, Adams draws from literary texts such as Jack Kerouac, Gary Snyder and Henry Miller {{to illustrate the}} California landscape. Adams professes his love of other genres other than classical music; his parents were jazz musicians, and he has also listened to rock music, albeit only passively. Adams once claimed that originality wasn't an urgent concern for <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> {{it was necessary for}} the minimalists, and compared his position to that of Gustav Mahler, J. S.

2500|$|During its history, {{the society}} of the pre-modern Islamic world was {{dominated}} by two important social contexts, nomadic life and Urbanism. The historian and politician Ibn Khaldun thoroughly discusses both concepts in his book Muqaddimah. According to <b>him,</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of life and culture of the rural bedouin nomads and the townspeople are opposed in a central social conflict. Ibn Khaldun explains {{the rise and fall of}} civilizations by his concept of Asabiyyah ("bond of cohesion", or [...] "family loyalty"), as exemplified by the rule of the caliphs. Bedouins, being the nomadic inhabitants of the steppe and the desert, are interconnected by strong bonds of asabiyyah and firm religious beliefs. These bonds tend to slacken in urban communities over some generations. In parallel, by losing their asabiyyah, the townspeople also lose the power to defend themselves, and fall victims to more aggressive tribes which may destroy the city and set up a new ruling dynasty, which over time is subject to the same weakening of power again.|$|E
