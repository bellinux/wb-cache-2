50|$|Glass fibre {{is used in}} the {{production}} of ironing board and mattress covers, ropes and cables, reinforcement fibre for composite materials, insect netting, flame-retardant and protective fabric, soundproof, fireproof, and insulating fibres. Glass fibres are woven and coated with Teflon to produce beta cloth, a virtually <b>fireproof</b> <b>fabric</b> which replaced nylon in the outer layer of United States space suits since 1968.|$|E
25|$|Tungsten {{trioxide}} is {{used for}} many purposes in everyday life. It is frequently used in industry to manufacture tungstates for x-ray screen phosphors, for <b>fireproofing</b> <b>fabrics</b> and in gas sensors. Due to its rich yellow color, WO3 is also used as a pigment in ceramics and paints.|$|R
50|$|Alginate absorbs water quickly, {{which makes}} it useful as an {{additive}} in dehydrated products such as slimming aids, and {{in the manufacture of}} paper and textiles. It is also used for waterproofing and <b>fireproofing</b> <b>fabrics,</b> in the food industry as a thickening agent for drinks, ice cream and cosmetics, and as a gelling agent for jellies.|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} an experimental investigation of sealed seams performance of {{two types of}} nonwoven <b>fireproof</b> <b>fabrics</b> laminated with bicomponent and hydrophilic membrane, which are used for moisture barrier layer in firefighters clothing. Seam strength in longitudinal and cross direction and resistance to water penetration were determined for investigation of quality of sealed seams with thermoplastic polyurethane tape. Determining the efficiency of sealed seams, optimal sealing parameters (temperature, sealing speed and quill pressure) were identified {{in order to achieve}} good seam performance. The experimental relations and empirical equations for the seam strength and resistance to water penetration determined in this research can be used to predict efficiency of seams quality applying different parameters of seam sealing process.

25|$|Just under 100,000 m2 of <b>fireproof</b> {{polypropylene}} <b>fabric,</b> {{covered by}} an aluminum layer, and 15km of rope were needed. The wrapping began on 17 June 1995 and was finished on 24 June. The spectacle {{was seen by}} five million visitors before the unveiling began on 7 July.|$|R
40|$|Report {{describes}} {{methods and}} {{materials used in}} waterproofing and <b>fireproofing</b> airplane <b>fabrics</b> using dopes. The determination of the probable life of a balloon fabric in service by experimental means is of great value in choosing the most suitable fabrics for a given purpose and in pointing the way to improvements in compounding and construction. The usefulness {{of exposure to the}} weather for this purpose has been amply demonstrated. Various {{attempts have been made to}} reproduce by artificial means the conditions promoting deterioration in service, but without marked success. Exposure to the weather remains the most satisfactory method for this purpose, and a consideration of the characteristics of such tests is therefore important. This report presents the results of a typical series of exposure tests made in 1917...|$|R
