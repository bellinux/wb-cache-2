40|$|Object {{recognition}} {{is a much}} studied computer vision problem, where the task {{is to find a}} given object in an image. This Master Thesis aims at doing a MATLAB implementation of an object recognition algorithm that finds three kinds of objects in images: electrical outlets, light switches and wall mounted air-conditioning controls. Visually, these three objects are quite similar and the aim {{is to be able to}} locate these objects in an image, as well as being able to distinguish them from one another. The object recognition was accomplished using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). During the training phase, the program was trained with images of the objects to be located, as well as reference images which did not contain the objects. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used in the classification phase. The performance was measured for two different setups, one where the training data consisted of photos and one where the training data consisted of <b>digitally</b> <b>generated</b> images created using a 3 D modeling software, in addition to the photos. The results show that using <b>digitally</b> <b>generated</b> images as training images didn’t improve the accuracy in this case. The reason for this is probably that there is too little intraclass variability in the gradients in <b>digitally</b> <b>generated</b> images, they’re too synthetic in a sense, which makes them poor at reflecting reality for this specific approach. The result might have been different if a higher number of <b>digitally</b> <b>generated</b> images had been used...|$|R

Reprinted by {{permission}} of the International Community for Auditory Display, [URL] effective navigation and analysis of large data sets is a persistent challenge within the scientific community. The objective of this experiment was to determine whether participants who received no training were able to identify audified data sets at a rate above chance in a forced-choice listening task. Nineteen participants with various levels of musical and scientific expertise were asked to place audio examples into one of the five following categories: <b>Digitally</b> <b>Generated</b> Sound - White Noise, Solar Wind Data, Neuron Firing Data from a Human Brain, Seismic Data (Earthquake Activity), and <b>Digitally</b> <b>Generated</b> Sound - Sinusoidal Waveform. At no time were participants made aware of the accuracy of their responses during the experiment. Participants who had never been exposed to audified data sets were able to recognize audification examples at a rate that was 23 percentage points above chance performance; however, the sample size of individuals with no previous exposure to audified data was not large enough to determine statistical significance. When controlling for previous exposure to any of the provided listening examples, all participants performed well above the statistical likelihood of chance responses in the recognition of <b>digitally</b> <b>generated</b> white noise and sinusoidal waveforms. This indicates that participants with no previous exposure to audified data were able to discriminate between audified data and <b>digitally</b> <b>generated</b> sounds.

40|$|Successful {{joint action}} often {{requires}} people {{to distinguish between}} their own and others’ contributions to a shared goal. One mechanism that is thought to underlie a self-other dis-tinction is sensory attenuation, whereby the sensory consequences of one’s own actions are reduced compared to other sensory events. Previous {{research has shown that}} the audi-tory N 1 event-related potential (ERP) response is reduced for self-generated compared to externally <b>generated</b> <b>tones.</b> The current study examined whether attenuation also occurs for jointly <b>generated</b> <b>tones,</b> which require two people to coordinate their actions to pro-duce a single tone. ERP responses were measured when participants <b>generated</b> <b>tones</b> alone (tone onset immediately followed the participant’s button press) or with a partner (tone onset immediately followed the participant’s or the partner’s button press, whichever occurred second). N 1 attenuation was smaller for jointly <b>generated</b> <b>tones</b> compared to self-generated <b>tones.</b> For jointly <b>generated</b> <b>tones,</b> greater delays between the participant’s and the partner’s button presses were associated with reduced attenuation; moreover, only trials in which there was no delay between the participant’s press and tone onset showed attenuation, whereas trials in which there were delays did not show attenuation. These findings indicate that people differentiate between their own and another person’s contri-butions to a joint action at the sensorimotor level, even when they must act together to produce a single, shared effect...|$|R

40|$|The line {{currents}} of three-phase {{diode bridge rectifier}} suffer from high THD. This THD is higher than IEEE standards. Injection of six harmonic components to the control signal of the boost converter connected to the three-phase diode bridge rectifier reduces the THD of the utility line current. In this paper a digital implementation of injecting six harmonic to the control signal of three-phase boost rectifier is shown. The digital implementation is carried out by using FPGA. In this study a sin-wave and a triangle-wave with six times the fundamental frequency and variable amplitude are <b>digitally</b> <b>generated</b> in the FPGA. Each signal {{is added to the}} dc control signal component of boost converter to be compared with <b>digitally</b> <b>generated</b> saw-tooth. The simulation and experimental results show that the THD of the utility line currents depends on the amplitude and phase-shift of the six-order component injected to the control signal of the boost converter and the angle of input three-phase voltage. © 2010 IEEE. 14 th International Conference on Harmonics and Quality of Powe...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE This {{systematic}} review verified the usefulness/limitations of static surgical guides during implant {{surgery in the}} edentulous maxilla. The PICO question was: "Does the use of <b>digitally</b> <b>generated</b> surgical guides vs conventional techniques affect the following outcomes: surgical complications, implant complications, prosthesis complications, implant survival, prosthesis survival, economics, patient satisfaction, and maintenance intervention?" MATERIALS AND METHODS The electronic searches retrieved 2, 588 unique articles from which eventually 36 full-text articles were read for eligibility. Because no randomized controlled clinical trials could be found, the PICO question had to be reformulated, now only looking to the outcome of <b>digitally</b> <b>generated</b> surgical guides without comparison with conventional techniques. RESULTS Although long-term data are lacking, the outcome of implants placed with a static guide and of the prosthetic reconstruction seems similar to that expected from conventional techniques. The number of surgical complications with guided surgery is negligible. Guided flapless implant surgery offers slightly more comfort for the patient; however, the economic benefits are unclear. CONCLUSION Implant therapy via static surgical guides in the maxilla is predictable, with slightly more comfort for the patient but with only minor economic advantages...|$|R
