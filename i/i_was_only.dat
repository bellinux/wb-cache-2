25|$|At first <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> {{thinking}} about the response from my clique of art school and skateboard friends. The fact that a larger segment of the public would not only notice, but investigate, the unexplained appearance of the stickers was something I had not contemplated. When I started to see reactions and consider the sociological forces at work surrounding {{the use of public}} space and the insertion of a very eye-catching but ambiguous image, I began to think there was the potential to create a phenomenon.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{did all of}} that on purpose, [...] I mean, if I'm {{going to}} plagiarize somebody, {{it might as well}} be me, right? I feel like I've earned the right to rip myself off. 'Talent borrows, genius steals,' [...] "Let's see how many other clichés I can throw in there. That's exactly it. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> hinting early on, but then I tell it like it is. It's like, now that I have your attention, I have a few things to tell you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> a prince!' {{said the}} stone-cutter to himself, as the {{carriage}} vanished round the corner. 'Oh, if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> a prince, and {{could go in}} such a carriage and have a golden umbrella held over me, how happy I should be!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The faults of my manner <b>are,</b> <b>I</b> think, <b>only</b> negative. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not proud. What has {{a man in}} my {{position}} to <b>be</b> proud of? <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>only</b> taciturn, phlegmatic, and joyless." ...|$|R

He almost fell out of his chair when I told him <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> 18." [...] Molly Ringwald had also wanted to play Sloane, but {{according}} to Ringwald, [...] "John wouldn't let me do it: he said that the part wasn't big enough for me." ...|$|E
500|$|On her Christmas Day 2007 {{television}} show, Martha Stewart {{exhibited the}} nativity scene she made in pottery {{classes at the}} Alderson Federal Prison Camp in Alderson, West Virginia while serving a 2005 sentence. She remarked, [...] "Even though every inmate was only allowed to do one a month, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> there for five months, I begged because I said I was an expert potter—ceramicist actually—and could I please make the entire nativity scene." [...] She supplemented her nativity figurines on the show with tiny artificial palm trees imported from Germany.|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} credit family members with {{introducing}} them to rock music through old collections of vinyl records. [...] Boone Daughdrill cites [...] "When the Levee Breaks" [...] as his biggest influence. [...] "When I heard that drum fill {{come in the}} intro...oh! [...] I {{was a little kid}} and my uncle had all of the Zeppelin records. He was a drummer too and he would always be like, 'Man, check these guys out.' <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> three or four and I didn’t know what music was, but I knew that I loved that." ...|$|E

500|$|Shea himself {{accepted}} the reassignment only reluctantly, feeling that [...] "it {{was as if}} NASA was trying to hide me from the Congress for what I might have said". Once in the job, he grew increasingly dissatisfied with a posting that he {{considered to be a}} [...] "non-job", later commenting that [...] "I don't understand why, after everything I had done for the program... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> one that was removed. That's {{the end of the program}} for me." [...] Only six months after the fire, and some two months after taking his new position, Shea left NASA in order to become a Vice President at the Polaroid Corporation in Waltham, Massachusetts. He had not been called to testify before the congressional inquiry into the fire.|$|E
500|$|... "Caught by the Fuzz" [...] {{was based}} on a real-life event: lead singer Gaz Coombes' arrest and caution for {{possession}} of cannabis at age fifteen. In a 2004 interview, Coombes said [...] "It wasn't trying to be a real statement, but at the time we knew that it was a big deal. Kids all around England were getting nicked for having a bit of hash on them. In Oxford that kind of thing happened quite a lot. It's all true so it was easy to write. It was a funny experience – not too funny at the time 'cause <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> 15 and shitting myself. The song has that disturbing energy. It's comparable to your heart racing. The adrenaline rush you get when your mum walks into the police station is similar to the energy of the song." ...|$|E
500|$|Oxford's Baird claimed [...] "I {{might have}} caught a crab, but I {{do not really}} know what happened." [...] Cambridge number six MacLeod said of the Dark Blues: [...] "They kept coming at us time and time again. [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> sure of victory in the last mile of the race." [...] Christopher Dodd, writing in The Guardian was impressed: [...] "The contest had a rare element ... it was a race nearly all the way, and was not all over in the first 20 stokes as has so often {{been the case in}} recent years." [...] Burnell {{suggested}} it was a race for the aficionados: [...] "This was surely one of those so common Boat Races, which are hard fought all the way, yet never exciting {{from the point of view}} of the average spectator." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. I wish {{to thank}} you for what you did for me. You are a very brave young man. Were I able to do so, <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> <b>only</b> too pleased to reward you liberally. But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>only</b> a poor teacher, and----" ...|$|R

500|$|One {{of these}} {{paintings}} was St. Jerome in the Wilderness, which Bortolon associates with a difficult period of Leonardo's life, as evidenced in his diary: [...] "I thought I {{was learning to}} live; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> learning to die." [...] Although the painting is barely begun, the composition can be seen and is very unusual. Jerome, as a penitent, occupies {{the middle of the}} picture, set on a slight diagonal and viewed somewhat from above. His kneeling form takes on a trapezoid shape, with one arm stretched to {{the outer edge of the}} painting and his gaze looking in the opposite direction. J. Wasserman points out the link between this painting and Leonardo's anatomical studies. Across the foreground sprawls his symbol, a great lion whose body and tail make a double spiral across the base of the picture space. The other remarkable feature is the sketchy landscape of craggy rocks against which the figure is silhouetted.|$|E
500|$|Gil's {{interest}} in music was precocious: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> two {{or two and}} a half," [...] he recalled, [...] "I told my mother I {{was going to become}} a musician or a president of my country." [...] He grew up listening to the forró music of his native northeast, and took an {{interest in}} the street performers of Salvador. Early on, he began to play the drums and the trumpet, through listening to Bob Nelson on the radio. Gil's mother was the [...] "chief supporter" [...] in his musical ambitions; she bought him an accordion and, when he was ten years old, sent him to music school in Salvador which he attended for four years. As an accordionist, Gil first played classical music, but grew more interested in the folk and popular music of Brazil. He was particularly influenced by singer and accordion player Luiz Gonzaga; he began to sing and play the accordion in an emulation of Gonzaga's recordings. Gil has noted that he grew to identify with Gonzaga [...] "because he sang about the world around , the world that [...] encountered." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1972, Christman {{joined the}} {{division}} of Scientology called the Sea Org, an elite unit within the organization. 3 News characterised the Sea Org as [...] "Scientology's senior management". In their book Cults and New Religions, Douglas E. Cowan and David G. Bromley describe the Sea Org writing, [...] "Described by the Church as 'a fraternal religious order,' members of the Sea Org 'occupy the most essential and trusted positions in the senior churches in the Scientology hierarchy'." [...] Rolling Stone notes, [...] "Sea Org members staff all of the senior ecclesiastic positions in the church hierarchy". In 2010, there were 5,000 members in the Sea Org. Her Sea Org career was short lived; she was instructed to cease taking prescribed medication for her epilepsy, {{and as a result}} experienced multiple serious seizures. In one instance two of her front teeth came out after she suffered a fall caused by a seizure while in the bathroom. She recounted these incidents of seizures, in an interview with CBS News, [...] "So I started having grand mal seizures, and I wasn't even off the medicine. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> off part of the medicine, and I started having very bad grand mal seizures." [...] Christman recalled that her epilepsy was not recognized as a genuine medical condition by the Scientology organization; whose practice was to instruct members to attempt self-treatment utilizing saunas and vitamins.|$|E

500|$|Jolin's artistic {{education}} {{started at}} the Technical School (later known as Konstfack) in Stockholm in 1906. The school mainly taught painting techniques and Jolin {{was more interested in}} learning about style. Within the year, he started looking for another place to continue his studies. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Konstnärsförbundet (The Artist's Association) had a school on Glasbruksgatan in Stockholm. Jolin applied there in the autumn of 1907. His future teacher Karl Nordström reviewed his drawings and Jolin was admitted to the school the same year. Jolin joined the inner circle at the school, a group of Scandinavian artists who would later become known as De Unga (The Young Ones) or 1909 års män (The Men of 1909). Among these were Isaac Grünewald, Leander Engström, Birger Simonsson and Gösta Sandels. Jolin described the pupils at the school as: [...] "...a bunch of individuals with long hair, great muffler scarves and slouch hats worn askew in a way that really impressed me since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> seventeen and the youngest of the bunch. The most amazing of them all was of course Isaac who had longer and more raven hair than anybody else and a fluttering violet scarf. I had not yet beheld such a creature. We became good friends." [...] Jolin's education at the Artist's Association was curtailed by the school's closure in the spring of 1908.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{features}} Beyoncé as the female protagonist singing about {{her love for}} the [...] "huge ego" [...] of her lover. Jay Lustig of New Jersey On-Line further noted that the song may be an insight into Beyoncé's marriage to Jay-Z. In an interview with Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News, Beyoncé clarified that [...] "Ego" [...] is on the Sasha Fierce disc because it is [...] "fun" [...] and very [...] "Sasha Fierce". She further explained that [...] "Ego" [...] reveals the story about someone being [...] "very confident and having [...] swagger when they walk and when they talk, and that {{being one of the}} reasons why [...] attracted to them." [...] The song explores the restrained vocals of Beyoncé singing [...] "I talk like this, cos I can back it up" [...] and consists of a piano breakdown. As Beyoncé sings, she lets out a slinky snarl in her voice. She describes the ego of her love interest as: [...] "It’s too big, it’s too wide, it’s too strong, it won’t fit, it’s too much." [...] The remix of the song features Kanye West rapping on it. He sings the lines, [...] "Now I’m standing next to Jay, who's standing next to B / Could have been anywhere in the world, but you're here with me / That's good for my ego... My ego is my imaginary friend / He was with me when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> imagining." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mannock's {{practice}} sessions had paid off. After one victory, he wrote, [...] "My man {{gave me an}} easy mark. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> ten yards away from him—on top so I couldn't miss! A beautifully coloured insect he was—red, blue, green, yellow. I let him have 60 rounds at that range, so there wasn't much left of him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chisholm {{has been}} open about her {{experiences}} with clinical depression and an eating disorder. Chisholm spoke of her eating disorder to Contact Music, stating: [...] "I'd hammered the gym {{for three hours}} a day. It {{was a way of}} running away, not thinking. I felt like a robot. When the papers started calling me 'Sumo Spice', <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> a size 10. But I was so upset by all the criticism, it got worse and I went up to a size 14".|$|E
