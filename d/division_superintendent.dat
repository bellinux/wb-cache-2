40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to examine the opinions of respondents regarding dispute resolution procedures utilized by public school teachers as described in sections 22. 1 - 312 of the Code of Virginia. In this study, demographic and opinion data were collected from individuals selected to serve as neutral chairpersons of fact-finding panels, school <b>division</b> <b>superintendents</b> or designees, local teacher association presidents, Virginia Education Association UniServ directors, and attorneys. The history, development, and intent of teacher dispute resolution procedures are presented in Chapter II. A descriptive research design was utilized. A researcher-designed survey instrument was used to gather demographic and opinion data from the five groups. Neutral chairpersons who had administrated a panel hearing were located through correspondence with school <b>division</b> <b>superintendents</b> or personnel directors and teacher association leaders in the state of Virginia. School <b>division</b> <b>superintendents</b> or designees employed in school divisions who had experienced a fact finding panel hearing were included in the investigation. The opinions of local iii teacher association presidents and UniServ directors were sought. Attorneys who had represented either a teacher or a school board during a grievance or dismissal hearing were included in the study. The information gathered was compared and analyzed statistically. Five surveys were developed for this study. The first part of each survey requested opinion data regarding the role and function of the fact-finding panel, the procedural framework of grievance and dismissal hearings, advisory fact-finding, and the experiences, training, and qualifications of neutral chairpersons. A five-point Likert-type scale was utilized with statements i [...] ...|$|R

Among the issues he faced upon beginning work in the head office in Rochester were several pending lawsuits against the R and disputes arising from the shady land acquisition practices of the company's forebear.

One major task - neither easily nor rapidly accomplished - was that of reshaping and coordinating research. This was achieved by transforming a group of largely autonomous scientific divisions into a unified institution with a clear mission and a fully coordinated research program. The first attempt at reorganization vested power in an executive committee composed of all the <b>division</b> <b>superintendents.</b> This committee was impracticably large, so in 1949, a civilian director of research was named and given full authority over the program.

A complex network of interconnected routes allowed mail to be transported and delivered in a remarkably short time.

[...] On a given RPO route, each clerk was expected to know not only the post offices and rail junctions along the route, but also specific local delivery details within each of the larger cities served by the route. Periodic testing demanded both accuracy and speed in sorting mail, and a clerk scoring only 96% accuracy would likely receive a warning from the Railway Mail Service <b>division</b> <b>superintendent.</b> Interurban and Streetcar systems were also known to operate RPOs.
