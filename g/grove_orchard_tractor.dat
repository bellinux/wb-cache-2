60|$|I said I {{should be}} delighted, though I {{had no idea}} what grounds were meant. As I {{followed}} Maude around the house she explained that all the Hutchins connection had a common back yard, as she expressed it. In reality, there were about two blocks of the property, extending behind all the houses. There were great trees with swings, <b>groves,</b> <b>orchards</b> where the late apples glistened between the leaves, an old-fashioned flower garden loath to relinquish its blooming. In the distance the shadowed western ridge hung like a curtain of deep blue velvet against the sunset.|$|R

50|$|The hoopoe has {{two basic}} {{requirements}} of its habitat: bare or lightly vegetated ground {{on which to}} forage and vertical surfaces with cavities (such as trees, cliffs or even walls, nestboxes, haystacks, and abandoned burrows) in which to nest. These requirements can be provided {{in a wide range}} of ecosystems, and as a consequence the hoopoe inhabits a wide range of habitats such as heathland, wooded steppes, savannas and grasslands, as well as forest glades. The Madagascar subspecies also makes use of more dense primary forest. The modification of natural habitats by humans for various agricultural purposes has led to hoopoes becoming common in olive <b>groves,</b> <b>orchards,</b> vineyards, parkland and farmland, although they are less common and are declining in intensively farmed areas. Hunting is of concern in southern Europe and Asia.|$|R
40|$|This senior project {{discusses}} the design, construction, {{and evaluation of}} an almond end-row nut sweeper. The sweeper attached to the three-point hitch of a John Deere <b>orchard</b> <b>tractor</b> using a Category 2 hitch and was used to sweep nuts back into the orchard after they had been swept into windrows. This system worked by utilizing the tractor hydraulics to power an 18 inch diameter cylinder brush. Proper field testing of the implement could not be done during the academic year in which this project was constructed since this implement {{was designed to be}} used as part of the California almond harvest, which occurs from late August to early September. However, preliminary tests were conducted at the Cal Poly Feed Mill by staging a mock almond windrow using almond hulls, and sweeping them along the concrete floor with the implement. These tests indicated that with some minor modifications, the implement should perform as intended...|$|R
50|$|Grey hypocoliuses forage {{quietly and}} methodically in foliage, through {{clusters}} of trees, palm <b>groves</b> and <b>orchards,</b> rarely {{coming to the}} ground.

6000|$|The old Douglas {{homestead}} {{was half}} a mile from [...] "Wayside" [...] cresting a windy hill. The house itself was large and comfortable, old enough to be dignified, and girdled with maple <b>groves</b> and <b>orchards.</b> There were big, trim barns behind it, and everything bespoke prosperity. Whatever the patient endurance in Mr. Douglas' face had meant it hadn't, so Anne reflected, meant debts and duns.|$|R
50|$|In 1865, Colfax, {{along with}} author Samuel Bowles and Lieutenant Governor of Illinois William Bross, set {{out across the}} western territories from Mississippi to the California coast to record their experiences.

Included in their book were details of the views of Los Angeles, with its wide panorama of vast citrus <b>groves</b> and <b>orchards,</b> and conversations with Brigham Young.|$|R
5000|$|To {{the east}} of {{downtown}} is the originally named [...] "Eastside," [...] which {{grew out of a}} colonia inhabited by Mexican immigrant workers in the orange <b>groves,</b> other <b>orchards</b> and produce fields. The area these people lived in was originally a settlement called La Placita that predated the city being founded in 1843. Mexican communities were also formed in the barrio of Casa Blanca during the early twentieth century.|$|R

60|$|Gervaise leant on the {{battlement}} {{and looked}} with admiration {{at the scene}} beyond. The land side was surrounded by hills, the ground rising very gradually from {{the foot of the}} walls. Every yard of ground was cultivated, and was covered with brilliant vegetation. <b>Groves</b> and <b>orchards</b> occurred thickly, while the slopes were dotted with chapels, summer houses--in which the natives of the city spent most of their time in the hot season--and other rustic buildings.|$|R
40|$|It is {{the purpose}} of this thesis to give a brief account of the work in {{forestation}} on the prairies and plains with special reference to Nebraska. This country has witnessed and taken part in the ruthless destruction of timber resources. Many fields have been cleared of all forestation for farming land. The majority of pioneer backwoodsmen did not consider the future implications of their actions. When Nebraska is described, it is depicted as a vast, treeless prairie. However, when one sees the land in person, {{it is clear that the}} “Great American Desert” is indeed a myth. The tree planters in eastern Nebraska had done well to plant tree, filling the state with <b>groves</b> and <b>orchards.</b> Those <b>groves</b> and <b>orchards</b> are monuments to the patience and perseverance of the early pioneers. Much has been written concerning the hardy frontiersmen, who by patient work, carved homes out of the wilderness. However, too little credit has been given to the tree planters who by their labors endeavored to make the prairie a more pleasant and profitable home for future generations. This thesis strives to give that due credit. Advisor:Unknow...|$|R

50|$|From late 1993 to 1998, Renault Agriculture and John Deere had a {{partnership}} agreement {{by which the}} former received John Deere engines manufactured at the Saran factory and in return it supplied John Deere with tractors marketed as the 3000 series. In 1994, Renault Agriculture and Massey Ferguson formed a strategic partnership, as part of which they set up an equally owned joint venture called Groupement International de Mécanique Agricole (GIMA) at a facility located next to Massey's Beauvais factory {{with the aim of}} manufacturing transaxles and related components. In 1995, Renault Agriculture agreed to market products from the British agricultural machinery manufacturer JCB through its dealership network in France. In 1997, the company took a 16.6% stake of Rovigo-based Agritalia, a manufacturer of <b>orchard</b> <b>tractors</b> for various clients. In 2000, it purchased a stake in the Indian manufacturer International Tractors (the owner of the Sonalika marque), forming a Sonalika-Renault joint venture. In 2003, as part of a plan to shed non-core assets, Renault sold a 51% majority stake in Renault Agriculture's tractor manufacturing plant to Claas. In 2006, Claas increased its ownership to 80% and in 2008 took full control and renamed it Claas Tractor. By 2005, the Renault marque was phased out and all the tractor models produced at Le Mans were badged as Claas.|$|R
50|$|When the Portuguese {{traveller}} Pedro Texeira {{passed through}} Najaf in 1604, {{he found the}} city in ruins, inhabited by little more than 500 people. This was largely {{the result of a}} change {{in the course of the}} Euphrates river eastwards in the direction of Hilla, leaving Najaf and Kufa high and dry, leading to the destruction of the local formerly rich agriculture, demise of the palm <b>groves</b> and <b>orchards,</b> followed by the salinization of the underground water due to evaporation.|$|R

The All Work II Model F was a lightweight tractor with a big surplus of power for general farming and <b>orchard</b> work. This <b>tractor</b> was fueled by kerosene.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is very {{pleasant}} to look at," [...] De Lille agreed. [...] "But all {{this would be}} a sore disadvantage to us if the Turks were besieging us, for the <b>groves</b> and <b>orchards</b> would conceal their approaches, the walls and buildings would give them shelter, and our cannon would be of little use until they reached the farther side of the ditch. If the Turks come, I hear it is decided to level all the buildings and walls, and to chop down every tree." ...|$|R
