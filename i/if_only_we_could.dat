50|$|In 1970, Rudy Schafer, an {{environmental}} education {{specialist in the}} California Department of Education in Sacramento, received funding from the Office of Environmental Education in the then-U.S. Office of Education {{to hold a meeting}} to enable state-level education and resource management professionals to share information about how to teach about the environment. Shafer invited two representatives each from 13 western states to a meeting in Seattle in 1970—one who worked in a state-level education agency and one who worked in a state-level natural resource agency. The group called itself the Western Regional Environmental Education Council.At WREEC’s third meeting in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 1973, two staff members from the American Forest Institute, a national association funded by forest products companies and since organized as the American Forest Foundation, attended and proposed that WREEC develop a forest-based, environmental education curriculum that AFI would fund. After some discussion, WREEC members agreed “but <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> build a credible, bias-free program based on strong pedagogical principles.”A small PLT staff coordinated writing workshops where teachers and resource professionals drafted and pre-tested what became an activity guide with 75 activities, entitled Project Learning Tree: Supplementary Curriculum Guide for Kindergarten through Grade 6. The guide has been continually revised and updated since the mid-1970s, most recently in 2006, but it still has many of the same elements from the original publication.|$|R
40|$|We give {{a simpler}} {{proof of a}} result of Hodkinson {{in the context of}} a blow and blur up {{construction}} argueing that the idea at heart is similar to that adopted by Andréka et all sayed. The idea is to blow up a finite structure, replacing each 'colour or atom' by infinitely many, using blurs to represent the resulting term algebra, but the blurs are not enough to blur the structure of the finite structure in the complex algebra. A reverse of this process exists in the literature, it builds algebras with infinite blurs converging to one with finite blurs. This idea due to Hirsch and Hodkinson, uses probabilistic methods of Erdos to construct a sequence of graphs with infinite chromatic number one that is 2 colourable. This construction, which works for both relation and cylindric algebras, further shows that the class of strongly representable atom structures is not elementary. We will generalize such a result for any class of algebras between diagonal free algebras and polyadic algebras with and without equality, then we further discuss possibilities for the infinite dimensional case. Finally, we suggest a very plausible equivalence, and that is: If n> 2, is finite, and ∈_n is countable and atomic, then is representable <b>if</b> and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> ∈_n_ω. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> prove one side.

The Communists were proposing a third party, a farmer-labor party, as a political maneuver for the 1948 elections. They were even picking the candidate.When Gates had finished, I took the floor. I said that while I would {{not rule out the}} possibility of building a farmer-labor party, surely the decision to place a third party in 1948 should be based not on whether Henry Wallace would run, but on whether a third party would help meet the needs of workers and farmers in America. And if a third party were to participate in the 1948 elections, the decision should be made immediately by bona-fide labor and farmer groups, and not delayed until some secret and unknown persons made the decision.My remarks were heard in icy silence. When I had finished, the committee with no answer to my objection simply went on to other work.However, it was becoming evident that the top clique {{was having a hard time}} with this proposition. It was also clear that Eugene Dennis and his clique of smart boys were reserving to themselves the right to make the final decision, and that the Party in general was being kept pretty much in the dark.|$|R

40|$|What is Dark Nature? This {{slightly}} provocative title {{refers to}} a series of conferences concerning the influence of the environment on humans during the Holocene. There is no doubt that human actions are forcing major changes to climate, landscapes and the environment. Contemporary discourse holds that environmental havoc is chiefly caused by humans and that, <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> manage our impacts on water, air, climate, the oceans and biodiversity, nature would be in fine balance, providing a benevolent ecosphere. However, despite the widespread influence of human actions, nature is also capable of rapid and dramatic change (Leroy, 2006). Throughout our planet’s geological history, its capacity for abrupt environmental change has provided the background and, commonly, the drivers for evolution. Such natural (i. e. non-human) activities shaped the physical (abiotic) environment through its interference with lake and sea levels, river channels and sediment load, slope stability, ground subsidence, frozen ground activity and desertification. Sudden sweeping change may be beneficial to life, with many environments requiring regular disturbance by hurricanes, wildfires or floods to maintain their ecological biodiversity. But occasionally natural disturbances affect too large an expanse, act with too excessive an intensity, or simply occur too fast or too frequently to be transient catalysts for environmental opportunism (Berger, 2006). Such changes, extreme examples of which are giant volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and floods, can inflict long-lasting harm on both the people and the environment. Between these opposing conditions of non-equilibrium sustainability and environmental destruction (collapse) is a continuum of natural disturbance with which communities and ecosystems have to cope (e. g. migration, adaptation, mitigation). Here, we refer to the potential for the natural environment to inflict harmful damage as ‘dark nature’ and highlight that these actions can occur on timescales of concern to society—that is, over a period of 100 years or less. Such ‘rapid’ environmental disturbances to ecosystems and communities include not only instantaneous catastrophes but also slow-onset, more pervasive changes to the environment, such as climate change. The aim of the Dark Nature programme is to refine the record of rapid (< 100 years) environmental changes affecting physical environments and ecosystems during the last 11, 500 years (the Holocene) ...|$|R

40|$|Background Testing for carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) in {{the blood}} is a {{recommended}} part of follow-up to detect recurrence of colorectal cancer following primary curative treatment. There is substantial clinical variation in the cut-off level applied to trigger further investigation. Objectives To determine the diagnostic performance of different blood CEA levels in identifying people with colorectal cancer recurrence in order to inform clinical practice. Search methods We conducted all searches to January 29 2014. We applied no language limits to the searches, and translated non-English manuscripts. We searched for relevant reviews in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, MEDION and DARE databases. We searched for primary studies (including conference abstracts) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Science Citation Index and Conference Proceedings Citation Index – Science. We identified ongoing studies by searching WHO ICTRP and the ASCO meeting library. Selection criteria We included cross-sectional diagnostic test accuracy studies, cohort studies, and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of post-resection colorectal cancer follow-up that compared CEA to a reference standard. <b>We</b> included studies <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> extract 2 x 2 accuracy data. We excluded case-control studies, as the ratio of cases to controls {{is determined by the}} study design, making the data unsuitable for assessing test accuracy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors (BDN, IP) assessed the quality of all articles independently, discussing any disagreements. Where <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not reach consensus, a third author (BS) acted as moderator. We assessed methodological quality against QUADAS- 2 criteria. We extracted binary diagnostic accuracy data from all included studies as 2 x 2 tables. We conducted a bivariate meta-analysis. We used the xtmelogit command in Stata to produce the pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity and we also produced hierarchical summary ROC plots. Main results In the 52 included studies, sensitivity ranged from 41 % to 97 % and specificity from 52 % to 100 %. In the seven studies reporting the impact of applying a threshold of 2. 5 µg/L, pooled sensitivity was 82 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 78 % to 86 %) and pooled specificity 80 % (95 % CI 59 % to 92 %). In the 23 studies reporting the impact of applying a threshold of 5 µg/L, pooled sensitivity was 71 % (95 % CI 64 % to 76 %) and pooled specificity 88 % (95 % CI 84 % to 92 %). In the seven studies reporting the impact of applying a threshold of 10 µg/L, pooled sensitivity was 68 % (95 % CI 53 % to 79 %) and pooled specificity 97 % (95 % CI 90 % to 99 %). Authors' conclusions CEA is insufficiently sensitive to be used alone, even with a low threshold. It is therefore essential to augment CEA monitoring with another diagnostic modality in order to avoid missed cases. Trying to improve sensitivity by adopting a low threshold is a poor strategy because of the high numbers of false alarms generated. We therefore recommend monitoring for colorectal cancer recurrence with more than one diagnostic modality but applying the highest CEA cut-off assessed (10 µg/L). </p...|$|R

Block (2004, 2) The {{academic}} {{field of}} education is so very reluctant to abandon social engineering. <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>we</b> can find the right technique, the right modifica-tion of classroom organization (small groups, collaborative learning, dialogue), <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>we</b> teach according to “best practices, ” <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>we</b> have students self-reflect or <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>we</b> develop “standards ” or conduct “scientific ” research, then students will learn what <b>we</b> teach them. <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>we</b> test regularly, “no child [will be] left behind. ” Social engineering—our predecessor Edward L. Thorndike (1922, 1) called it, simply, “human engineering”—appears to assume that edu-cation is like a complex automobile engine: <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>we</b> make the right adjustments—in teaching, in learning, in assessment—it will hum, and transport us to our destination, the promised land of high test scores, or, for many of us on the educational left, a truly democratic society (Gaztambide-Fernandez and Sears, 2004). America’s historic preoccupations with business and religion have provided cultural support for such a view of mind, a view profoundly anti-intellectual in consequence, as Richard Hofstadter (1962) has fa-mously documented. The “business-minded ” are interested in design-ing “effects ” on situations that can be profitable. In this sense, social engineering is the complement of capitalism. The “religiously-minded” mangle the present by disavowing it (“the best is yet to come”) or by employing religious rituals (such as prayer) to manipulate present cir-cumstances.
