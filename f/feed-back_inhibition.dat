In Escherichia coli, thrA, metLM, and lysC encode aspartokinase isozymes that show feedback inhibition by threonine, methionine, and lysine, respectively.

40|$|Abstract Background The Hedgehog (Hh) {{signaling}} pathway, acting {{through three}} homologous transcription factors (GLI 1, GLI 2, GLI 3) in vertebrates, plays multiple roles in embryonic organ development and adult tissue homeostasis. At {{the level of}} the genome, GLI factors bind to specific motifs in enhancers, some of which are hundreds of kilobases removed from the gene promoter. These enhancers integrate the Hh signal in a context-specific manner to control the spatiotemporal pattern of target gene expression. Importantly, a number of genes that encode Hh pathway molecules are themselves targets of Hh signaling, allowing pathway regulation by an intricate balance of <b>feed-back</b> activation and <b>inhibition.</b> However, surprisingly few of the critical enhancer elements that control these pathway target genes have been identified despite the fact that such elements are central determinants of Hh signaling activity. Recently, ChIP studies have been carried out in multiple tissue contexts using mouse models carrying FLAG-tagged GLI proteins (GLIFLAG). Using these datasets, we tested whether a meta-analysis of GLI binding sites, coupled with a machine learning approach, could reveal genomic features {{that could be used to}} empirically identify Hh-regulated enhancers linked to loci of the Hh signaling pathway. Results A meta-analysis of four existing GLIFLAG datasets revealed a library of GLI binding motifs that was substantially more restricted than the potential sites predicted by previous in vitro binding studies. A machine learning method (kmer-SVM) was then applied to these datasets and enriched k-mers were identified that, when applied to the mouse genome, predicted as many as 37, 000 potential Hh enhancers. For functional analysis, we selected nine regions which were annotated to putative Hh pathway molecules and found that seven exhibited GLI-dependent activity, indicating that they are directly regulated by Hh signaling (78  % success rate). Conclusions The results suggest that Hh enhancer regions share common sequence features. The kmer-SVM machine learning approach identifies those features and can successfully predict functional Hh regulatory regions in genomic DNA surrounding Hh pathway molecules and likely, other Hh targets. Additionally, the library of enriched GLI binding motifs that we have identified may allow improved identification of functional GLI binding sites...|$|R

The selected clone, named D 5 R 5, showed a growth rate higher than that of wild-type. It was less sensitive also to an equimolar mixture of the three branched-chain amino acids, but did not display cross-resistance to isoleucine and leucine. The increased tolerance was due to neither a reduced valine uptake, nor a modification in the level or sensitivity to <b>feed-back</b> <b>inhibition</b> by valine of the first common enzyme (and the main regulative site) in isoleucine, leucine and valine synthesis, acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS). When wild-type cells were fed with valine or equimolar mixtures of the three aminoacids, a decrease in AHAS level was found. On the contrary, the level of extractable AHAS activity from D 5 R 5 cells was significantly less affected by similar treatments, suggesting that some alteration in enzyme modulation mechanism(s) could account for valine resistance...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNitrate {{transport}} by Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 cells was inhibited by ammonium and by inhibitors of CO 2 fixation. Ammonium assimilation inhibitors, such as l-methionine d,l-sulfoximine, {{were known}} to prevent {{the negative effects of}} ammonium and of inhibitors of CO 2 fixation on nitrate uptake, leading to propose that CO 2 fixation was required to counteract the <b>feed-back</b> <b>inhibition</b> of nitrate assimilation. In NR-less mutants, l-methionine d,l-sulfoximine prevented the negative effects of ammonium on nitrate transport, but not always prevented those of inhibiting CO 2 fixation. The carboxy-terminal domain of the NrtC subunit of the nitrate transporter has recently been identified as a regulatory domain involved in N-control. The mutant strain NC 2, constructed by deleting the 3 ′ portion of nrtC, showed high nitrate transport activity insensitive to ammonium but sensitive to inhibitors of CO 2 fixation.

40|$|A {{large number}} of cells from the lateral aspect of the supramammillary nucleus (SUML) and the medial septum complex (MSC) {{innervate}} the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. It has been demonstrated that electrical prestimulation of the SUML or the MSC enhances perforant path-dentate gyrus evoked field potentials. Considering the {{large number of}} fibres that pass through these regions, the effects glutamatergic stimulation of these regions had on dentate gyrus field potentials in urethane-anaesthetized rats was investigated. The perforant path was stimulated at a rate of 0. 1 Hz, evoking an EPSP and a population spike in the dentate gyrus granule cell layer. L-glutamate was delivered by pressure injection (500 mM, 100 - 150 nl). In a second experiment, concomitant measures of hippocampal EEG, spontaneous unit activity, and the evoked potential recorded at the molecular layer were also taken. As well, the effects of glutamatergic activation of these areas on paired-pulse inhibition was investigated. [...] Glutamate ejection to the SUML and MSC produced a significant enhancement of the population spike. The duration of enhancement ranged from 2 to 54 min (X = 18. 4 min) and from 1 to 49 min (X = 10. 5 min) after SUML and MSC activation respectively. A consistent, but relatively short increase in the EPSP slope was demonstrated after MSC activation but not after SUML activation. No consistent effects were found on the 2 latency measures. [...] SUML and MSC activation induced theta in 4 of 7 (duration= 10 - 45 s) and 7 of 10 animals (duration= 20 - 112 s), respectively. Theta induction preceded spike enhancement and occurred for a shorter duration than the enhancement. [...] After either SUML or MSC activation the effects on spontaneous unit activity were mixed. However, all changes in firing rate preceded spike enhancement, and their duration rarely coincided with the duration of the spike enhancement. [...] Results of paired-pulses (lSI= 20 - 30 ms) given during SUML activation demonstrated evidence of reduced <b>feed-back</b> <b>inhibition,</b> despite an absence of the enhancement of the first spike of the pair. MSC activation produced a reduction of <b>feed-back</b> <b>inhibition</b> in one of three animals where the first spike of the pair was enhanced...|$|E
40|$|Proline {{has been}} {{reported}} to accumulate during osmotic stress in many plant species and has been proposed to be directly involved in stress adaptation. However, whether or not a constitutive accumulation of proline can facilitate osmotic adjustment and adaptation has not been established. ^ The enzyme catalyzing the rate-limiting reaction for proline biosynthesis, Δ- 1 -pyrroline- 5 -carboxylate synthetase (P 5 CS) has been cloned from several species and it {{has been shown to be}} allosterically feed-back inhibited by proline. Following what has been proposed in bacteria a few years ago, we rationalized that overexpression of a mutated P 5 CS gene lacking <b>feed-back</b> <b>inhibition</b> would be an appropriate strategy to increase the constitutive level of proline. We therefore cloned tomPRO 2, the gene encoding the tomato P 5 CS, and we isolated 15 tomPRO 2 mutations allowing the overaccumulation of high levels of proline in bacteria. Sequence analysis of three of these mutants revealed novel single amino acid substitutions in the γ-glutamyl kinase, the domain of tomPRO 2 that is sensitive to <b>feed-back</b> <b>inhibition.</b> ^ By overexpressing the mutated tomPRO 2 in Arabidopsis plants, we were able to increase the constitutive level of proline 10 fold. In contrast with other reports, the transgenic plants did not show differences in cell osmotic potentials, fresh weights and dry weights, relative to their controls, when grown in presence or absence of NaCl. Overexpression of tomPRO 2 and its mutated derivatives in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae led to a 20 fold increase of the basal proline level. However, expression of the plant gene(s) in a yeast genetic background deficient in the structural gene for proline oxidase, led to an increase in the proline content of more than 100 fold. In the yeast strains expressing the plants genes, the cellular proline concentration was inversely proportional to their growth rate. This caused an apparent salt tolerance so that, at 250 mM NaCl, the growth of the wild type strain was inhibited 30 % whereas the growth of proline overproducing strains was not inhibited. Such tolerance was noticeable only with NaCl-induced and LiCl-induced stress, but not with sorbitol-induced stress, suggesting that it was ion-specific and not osmo-specific. ...|$|E

Substrate binding, catalysis and <b>feed-back</b> <b>inhibition</b> by proline are functions of the N-terminal ∼ 260 -residue domain of G 5 K. We study here the impact on these functions of 14 site-directed mutations affecting 9 residues of Escherichia coli G 5 K, chosen {{on the basis of}} the structure of the bisubstrate complex of the homologous enzyme acetylglutamate kinase (NAGK). The results support the predicted roles of K 10, K 217 and T 169 in catalysis and ATP binding and of D 150 in orienting the catalytic lysines. They support the implication of D 148 and D 150 in glutamate binding and of D 148 and N 149 in proline binding. Proline increases the S 0. 5 for glutamate and appears to bind at a site overlapping with the site for glutamate. We conclude that G 5 K and NAGK closely resemble each other concerning substrate binding and catalysis, but that they have different mechanisms of feed-back control...|$|E

Byproduct inhibition experiments showed that maintaining propionic acid concentration in broth below 10 - 20 g/L in the early stage and 20 - 30 g/L in the late stage can efficiently improve vitamin B 12 biosynthesis. Batch fermentation indicated the occurrence of <b>feed-back</b> <b>inhibition</b> in intracellular intermediate biosynthesis. In addition, the incorporation of the precursor DMB depended on the fermentation level of the vitamin B 12 intermediate.

It is a GABA-immunoreactive interneuron and most likely parvalbumin-immunoreactive. Its conspicuous axonal arbor is characterised by an initial segment arising from the soma or from a juxtasomatic dendritic segment. The initial axon segment ramifies and gives rise to thick myelinated segments that terminate in short unmyelinated branches studded with thick boutons 'en passant' that (1) make axosomatic synapses on bipyramidal neuronal somata and (2) synapse on initial apical dendritic segments of bipyramidal neurons forming climbing-like cartridges.

Of 48 subjects evaluated, 26 (54 %) were seropositive for H. pylori by ELISA. Fasting and peptone meal-stimulated gastrin release at pH 2. 5 and pH 5. 5 as well as integrated 24 -hour plasma gastrin concentrations were significantly higher in the seropositive group, even when subjects with a history of duodenal ulcer were ex-cluded. The inhibitory effect of low pH on the release of gastrin was not attenuated in subjects with positive results in the ELISA. These data indicate that the association between seropositiv-ity for H. pyloriand enhanced release of gastrin is independent of a history of duodenal ulcer and is not caused by a disturbance of the normal feedback inhibition of gastrin release by in-tragastric acid.

In this study, we are able to show the interaction of the stress hormone cortisol with its two nuclear receptors, the high affinity glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the low affinity pregnane X-receptor (PXR) by using a mathematical model based on realistic kinetic parameters. We checked the importance of regulatory loops, within this network, in terms of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic responses. Then, we demonstrate the alterations in the system response with respect to variable cortisol perturbations, such as initial single peak in cortisol, and repeated stimuli of cortisol with differing frequencies and time frames. As a conclusion, we reveal that the network is robust towards low frequency perturbations, shows adaptation at moderate stress frequencies, but transitions to an altered steady state at high frequency stimulation, which we believe is a predisposing factor towards stress-induced pathologies...|$|E

However, the genetic basis of this switch is unknown. Pyruvate formate lyase (PFL) is a crucial enzyme for mixed acid fermentation. Functional PFL requires the activities of two enzymes: pyruvate formate lyase activating enzyme (coded by pflA) and pyruvate formate lyase (coded by pflB). To understand the genetic basis of mixed acid fermentation, transcriptional regulation of pflA and pflB was studied. By microarray analysis of ΔpflB, differential regulation of several transcriptional regulators were identified, and CcpA, and GlnR's role in active PFL synthesis was studied in detail as these regulators directly interact with the putative promoters of both pflA and pflB, their mutation attenuated pneumococcal growth, and their expression was induced on host-derived sugars, indicating that these regulators have a role in sugar metabolism, and multiple regulators are involved in active PFL synthesis. We also found that the influence of each regulator on pflA and pflB expression was distinct in terms of activation and repression, and environmental condition.

In the present work, site-directed mutagenesis was used to investigate the involvement of the C-terminal region of the regulatory chain in the process of <b>feed-back</b> <b>inhibition</b> by CTP. Removal of the two last C-terminal residues of the regulatory chains is sufficient to abolish entirely the sensitivity of the enzyme to CTP. Thus, it appears that the contact between this region and the 240 s loop of the catalytic chain (R 1 -C 4 type of interaction) is essential for the transmission of the regulatory signal which results from CTP binding to the regulatory site. None of the modifications made in the R 1 -C 4 interface altered the sensitivity of the enzyme to the activator ATP, suggesting that the effect of this nucleotide rather involves the R 1 -C 1 type of interface.

The reaction causes the temperature/pressure to rise, and the rising temperature/pressure exerts a <b>feed-back</b> <b>inhibition</b> on the reaction to generate a feed-back loop (oscillation). An oscillation phenomenon was observed during the microcalorimetric evaluation of 20 mm gun propellant. The heat flow began to gradually start a sinusoidal type oscillation after approximately 105 days of aging at 80 ºC (~ 70 % decomposition). The system resembles the Lotka model from 1910 with the variation that the autocatalytic reaction is substituted by a reaction with thermic acceleration, and the reaction which removes the autocatalytic substance is substituted by the transport of heat out of the system. The pattern of the oscillation is affected by internal gas pressure which is a function of the free head space of the test ampule. A possible similarity of the oscillation is suggested to the time-to-fume as determined by the NATO 65. 5 °C thermal stability tests used in other 20 mm propellants.

Currently, no effective antiretroviral treatment options are available to restrict the development of diseases associated with the virus. In this work, we investigated the activity of pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP) on HTLV-I, when expressed from a proviral clone in 293 T cells or in an HTLV-I immortalized cell line. PAP is a plant-derived N-glycosidase that exhibits antiviral activity against a number of viruses; however, {{its mode of action}} has not been clearly defined. Here, we describe the mechanism by which PAP inhibited production of HTLV-I. We show that PAP depurinated nucleotides within the gag open reading frame and suppressed the synthesis of viral proteins in part by decreasing the translational efficiency of HTLV-I gag/pol mRNA. Observed reduction in levels of viral mRNAs were not due to enhanced degradation; rather, decreased amounts of viral transactivator protein, Tax, led to <b>feed-back</b> <b>inhibition</b> of transcription from the viral promoter. Therefore, PAP efficiently suppressed HTLV-I gene expression at both translational and transcriptional levels, resulting in substantially diminished virus production.

As there is no enzymatic detoxification mechanism available in plants to destroy (1) O(2), its generation should be minimized. We manipulated the concentration of a major chlorophyll biosynthetic intermediate i. e., protochlorophyllide in Arabidopsis by overexpressing the light-inducible protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase C (PORC) that effectively phototransforms endogenous protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide leading to minimal accumulation of the photosensitizer protochlorophyllide in light-grown plants. In PORC overexpressing (PORCx) plants exposed to high-light, the (1) O(2) generation and consequent malonedialdehyde production was minimal and the maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II remained unaffected demonstrating that their photosynthetic apparatus and cellular organization were intact. Further, PORCx plants treated with 5 -aminolevulinicacid when exposed to light, photo-converted over-accumulated protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide, reduced the generation of (1) O(2) and malonedialdehyde production and reduced plasma membrane damage. So PORCx plants survived and bolted whereas, the 5 -aminolevulinicacid-treated wild-type plants perished. Thus, overexpression of PORC could be biotechnologically exploited in crop plants for tolerance to (1) O(2) -induced oxidative stress, paving the use of 5 -aminolevulinicacid as a selective commercial light-activated biodegradable herbicide. Reduced protochlorophyllide content in PORCx plants released the protochlorophyllide-mediated <b>feed-back</b> <b>inhibition</b> of 5 -aminolevulinicacid biosynthesis that resulted in higher 5 -aminolevulinicacid production. Increase of 5 -aminolevulinicacid synthesis upregulated the gene and protein expression of several downstream chlorophyll biosynthetic enzymes elucidating a regulatory net work of expression of genes involved in 5 -aminolevulinicacid and tetrapyrrole biosynthesis...|$|E
40|$|Intracellular {{recordings}} {{were made}} from neurones in the nucleus locus coeruleus (l. c.) in slices of rat pons maintained in vitro. Focal electrical stimulation to the slice surface within {{the region of the}} l. c. evoked a synaptic depolarization followed by a hyperpolarization. These potentials were graded with stimulus intensity and were abolished in calcium-free and/or high-magnesium solutions. The nature of the hyperpolarizing synaptic potential (i. p. s. p.) was investigated. The i. p. s. p. amplitude decreased as the membrane was artificially made more negative and reversed at - 114 mV. This reversal potential shifted to less negative potentials in solutions of elevated potassium ion content as predicted by the Nernst equation. The i. p. s. p. was potentiated in amplitude and its time course was prolonged by desmethylimipramine (DMI). Yohimbine (100 nM) and phentolamine (100 nM) reversibly abolished the i. p. s. p. and did not change the synaptic depolarization. Noradrenaline hyperpolarized all l. c. neurones tested, whether applied by perfusion (1 - 30 microM) or by pressure ejection from a micropipette placed in the solution near the recording site. The noradrenaline-induced hyperpolarization was accompanied by an increase in conductance and it reversed in polarity at - 104 mV. The reversal potential of the noradrenaline hyperpolarization became less negative when the potassium ion content was increased. The noradrenaline-induced hyperpolarization was potentiated by DMI and was antagonized by yohimbine and phentolamine in the same concentrations which blocked the i. p. s. p. The results support the notion that l. c. neurones can release noradrenaline onto the somadendritic membrane of other l. c. neurones and thereby provide local <b>feed-back</b> <b>inhibition...</b>|$|E
40|$|Deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) (EC 2. 7. 1. 74) is a {{key enzyme}} in the {{activation}} of several therapeutic nucleoside analogs (NA). Its activity can be increased in vivo by Ser- 74 phosphorylation, a property {{that could be used}} for enhancing NA activation and clinical efficacy. In line with this, studies with recombinant dCK showed that mimicking Ser- 74 phosphorylation by a S 74 E mutation increases its activity toward pyrimidine analogs. However, purine analogs had not been investigated. Here, we show that the S 74 E mutation increased the k(cat) for cladribine (CdA) by 8 - or 3 -fold, depending on whether the phosphoryl donor was ATP or UTP, for clofarabine (CAFdA) by about 2 -fold with both ATP and UTP, and for fludarabine (F-Ara-A) by 2 -fold, but only with UTP. However, the catalytic efficiencies (k(cat) /Km) were not, or slightly, increased. The S 74 E mutation also sensitized dCK to <b>feed-back</b> <b>inhibition</b> by dCTP, regardless of the phosphoryl donor. Importantly, we did not observe an increase of endogenous dCK activity toward purine analogs after in vivo-induced increase of Ser- 74 phosphorylation. Accordingly, treatment of CLL cells with aphidicolin, which enhances dCK activity through Ser- 74 phosphorylation, did not modify the conversion of CdA or F-Ara-A into their active triphosphate form. Nevertheless, the same treatment enhanced activation of gemcitabine (dFdC) into dFdCTP in CLL as well as in HCT- 116 cells and produced synergistic cytotoxicity. We conclude that increasing phosphorylation of dCK on Ser- 74 might constitute a valuable strategy to enhance the clinical efficacy of some NA, like dFdC, but not of CdA or F-Ara-A...|$|E
40|$|N-acetyl-L-glutamate kinase (NAGK) catalyzes the second, {{generally}} controlling, step of arginine biosynthesis. In yeasts, NAGK exists either {{alone or}} forming a metabolon with N-acetyl-L-glutamate synthase (NAGS), which catalyzes {{the first step}} and exists only within the metabolon. Yeast NAGK (yNAGK) has, {{in addition to the}} amino acid kinase (AAK) domain found in other NAGKs, a ~ 150 -residue C-terminal domain of unclear significance belonging to the DUF 619 domain family. We deleted this domain, proving that it stabilizes yNAGK, slows catalysis and modulates <b>feed-back</b> <b>inhibition</b> by arginine. We determined the crystal structures of both the DUF 619 domain-lacking yNAGK, ligand-free as well as complexed with acetylglutamate or acetylglutamate and arginine, and of complete mature yNAGK. While all other known arginine-inhibitable NAGKs are doughnut-like hexameric trimers of dimers of AAK domains, yNAGK has as central structure a flat tetramer formed by two dimers of AAK domains. These dimers differ from canonical AAK dimers in the - 110 ° rotation of one subunit with respect to the other. In the hexameric enzymes, an N-terminal extension, found in all arginine-inhibitable NAGKs, forms a protruding helix that interlaces the dimers. In yNAGK, however, it conforms a two-helix platform that mediates interdimeric interactions. Arginine appears to freeze an open inactive AAK domain conformation. In the complete yNAGK structure, two pairs of DUF 619 domains flank the AAK domain tetramer, providing a mechanism for the DUF 619 domain modulatory functions. The DUF 619 domain exhibits the histone acetyltransferase fold, resembling the catalytic domain of bacterial NAGS. However, the putative acetyl CoA site is blocked, explaining the lack of NAGS activity of yNAGK. We conclude that the tetrameric architecture is an adaptation to metabolon formation and propose an organization for this metabolon, suggesting that yNAGK may be a good model also for yeast and human NAGSs...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 Nutritional {{studies with}} Acetobacter suboxydans {{indicated}} that when isoleucine, lysine, methionine, serine and arginine were singly omitted from a complete amino acid mixture, no growth was obtained. However, the organism could grow on single amino acids like glutamic acid, histidine and proline. No growth was obtained with ammonium sulfate {{as the sole}} nitrogen source. An investigation on the cause for the apparent requirement for isoleucine was made. When valine was added to a synthetic medium containing histidine, glutamic acid, proline and ammonium sulfate no growth was obtained. Valine appeared to inhibit growth, an effect which could be reversed by addition of isoleucine. Cell-free extracts of the organism synthesize both valine and isoleucine from acetolactate and acetohydroxybutyrate respectively. The amounts of the two amino acids synthesized from different intermediates were determined. A study of the mechanism of growth inhibition due to valine was initiated. U-C¹⁴ threonine was incorporated into isoleucine by growing cells. The {{first step in the}} biosynthesis of isoleucine from threonine is the deamination of the latter to ?-ketobutyrate. This enzyme, threonine deaminase, was precipitated from cell-free extracts at 50 percent saturation with ammonium sulfate. Using this fraction, {{it was found that the}} activity of the deaminase was competitively inhibited by valine and isoleucine. Although isoleucine repressed the synthesis of the deaminase, valine did not. Therefore one mechanism by which valine inhibits growth of the organism is by <b>feed-back</b> <b>inhibition</b> of the threonine deaminase thereby limiting isoleucine biosynthesis. This is evident by an apparent requirement for isoleucine when valine is present in the growth medium. No inhibition of the transport of isoleucine across the cell wall was observed. Mutants of Acetobacter suboxydans have been isolated which are prototrophic towards isoleucine and resistant to growth inhibition by valine. Some of these mutants possess a threonine deaminase which is not sensitive to valine or isoleucine...|$|E
40|$|Fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphatase (FBPase) is a {{critical}} regulatory enzyme in gluconeogenesis. In mammals, the enzyme is subject to metabolic regulation; the hormones insulin and glucagon reciprocally regulate the enzyme in the liver through the controlled production and degradation of the inhibitor fructose- 2, 6 -bisphosphate (Fru- 2, 6 -P 2) and hence control hepatic glucose production. FBPase is nearly ubiquitous in living organisms and in the bacterium Escherichia coli, the homologous enzyme is imperative for growth on gluconeogenic substrates. How does this organism regulate FBPase {{without the use of}} exogenous hormones or Fru- 2, 6 -P 2 ? Investigations reported herein describe high resolution crystal structures of the enzyme from E. coli which have revealed the existence of both novel allosteric activation and inhibition sites for metabolites in the glycolytic/gluconeogenic pathway, transforming the accepted schemes of regulation of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in bacteria. Metabolites upstream of FBPase (phosphoenolpyruvate, citrate, and others) activate the enzyme while downstream products (glucose 6 -phosphate) inhibit the enzyme in classical feed-forward activation and <b>feed-back</b> <b>inhibition</b> schemes. Additionally, both types of effectors leverage their impact by altering the affinity of the enzyme for the ubiquitously present inhibitor AMP in a manner analogous to the effect of Fru- 2, 6 -P 2 on the mammalian enzyme. A complex regulatory scheme for bacterial FBPase is described herein which also illustrates how distinct regulatory mechanisms can co-evolve to utilize the same protein scaffold. Further investigations revealed changes in the mammalian enzyme in response to physiological effectors, which answer questions that have been unresolved for 25 years and enrich the current understanding of mammalian metabolic regulation. These observations have direct relevance to human health, specifically in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. Future investigations may lead to the development of novel inhibitors toward mammalian FBPase which can relieve diabetic hyperglycemia...|$|E
40|$|Summary PC 12 - 27, a PC 12 clone {{characterized}} by {{high levels of}} the transcription repressor REST and by very low mTORC 2 activity, had {{been shown to be}} unresponsive to NGF, possibly because of its lack of the specific TrkA receptor. The neurotrophin receptor repressed by high REST in PC 12 - 27 cells, however, is shown now to be not TrkA, which is normal, but p 75 NTR, whose expression is inhibited at the transcriptional level. When treated with NGF, the PC 12 - 27 cells lacking p 75 NTR exhibited a defective TrkA autophosphorylation restricted, however, to the TrkA(Y 490) site, and an impairment of the PI 3 K signaling cascade. This defect was sustained in part by a mTORC 1 -dependent <b>feed-back</b> <b>inhibition</b> that in wtPC 12 cells appeared marginal. Transfection of p 75 NTR to a level and surface distribution analogous to wtPC 12 did not modify various high REST-dependent properties of PC 12 - 27 cells such as high β-catenin, low TSC 2 and high proliferation rate. In contrast, the defective PI 3 K signaling cascade and its associated mTORC 2 activity were largely rescued together with the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth response. These changes were not due to p 75 NTR alone but required its cooperation with TrkA. Our results demonstrate that, in PC 12, high REST induces alterations of NGF signaling which, however, are indirect, dependent on the repression of p 75 NTR; and that the well-known potentiation by p 75 NTR of the TrkA signaling does not concern all the effects induced by NGF but primarily the PI 3 K cascade and its associated mTORC 2, a complex known {{to play an important role}} in neural cell differentiation...|$|E
40|$|Microbial {{production}} strains {{are currently}} improved {{using a combination}} of random and targeted approaches. In the case of a targeted approach, potential bottlenecks, <b>feed-back</b> <b>inhibition,</b> and side-routes are removed, and other processes of interest are targeted by overexpressing or knocking-out the gene(s) of interest. To date, the selection of these targets has been based at its best on expert knowledge, but to a large extent also on 'educated guesses' and 'gut feeling'. Therefore, time and thus money is wasted on targets that later prove to be irrelevant or only result in a very minor improvement. Moreover, in current approaches, biological processes that are not known {{to be involved in the}} formation of a specific product are overlooked and it is impossible to rank the relative importance of the different targets postulated. Metabolomics, a technology that involves the non-targeted, holistic analysis of the changes in the complete set of metabolites in the cell in response to environmental or cellular changes, in combination with multivariate data analysis (MVDA) tools like principal component discriminant analysis and partial least squares, allow the replacement of current empirical approaches by a scientific approach towards the selection and ranking of targets. In this review, we describe the technological challenges in setting up the novel metabolomics technology and the principle of MVDA algorithms in analyzing biomolecular data sets. In addition to strain improvement, the combined metabolomics and MVDA approach can also be applied to growth medium optimization, predicting the effect of quality differences of different batches of complex media on productivity, the identification of bioactives in complex mixtures, the characterization of mutant strains, the exploration of the production potential of strains, the assignment of functions to orphan genes, the identification of metabolite-dependent regulatory interactions, and many more microbiological issues. © Society for Industrial Microbiology 2005...|$|E
40|$|Acute and {{prolonged}} critical illness are different metabolic and neuroendocrine paradigms and should perhaps be approached with different therapeutic strategies. The initial endocrine response consists primarily of an activated release of anterior pituitary hormones and peripheral inactivation of anabolic pathways, thought to provide substrates for survival while anabolism is postponed and {{to activate the}} immune cascade while the host is being protected against deleterious effects of the latter. There is still no solid basis for hormonal intervention in the acute phase of illness. The development of modern intensive care now enables survival of previously lethal conditions and unmasked previously unknown disorders such as the "wasting syndrome" of chronic intensive care-dependency. In the chronic phase of critical illness, we documented a uniformly impaired pulsatile secretion of anterior pituitary hormones, {{at least in part}} of hypothalamic origin, to correlate positively with reduced activity of target tissues. An acute event complicating the chronic phase of illness may evoke mixed acute/prolonged endocrine patterns, which are difficult to interpret and account for some of the apparent paradoxes in the literature. It is unlikely that the reduced neuroendocrine stimulation, distinctively present in the chronic phase of illness, has been selected by evolution and should accordingly be considered as time-honoured and appropriate. The hypothesis of inappropriate neuroendocrine dysfunction can be validated by studying the effects either of combined peripheral hormonal substitution or of hypophysiotropic releasing peptide administration. We demonstrated that selected pituitary-dependent axes can be reactivated in the chronic phase of critical illness, with preserved peripheral responsiveness. Intervening at the hypothalamic-pituitary level appears to be a safer strategy compared to administration of peripheral hormones, as presence of active <b>feed-back</b> <b>inhibition</b> prevents overtreatment on an individual basis {{at a time when it}} is difficult [...] if not impossible [...] to determine what is a "normal" or "optimal" level of circulating peripheral hormones. Whether this novel endocrine strategy will result in beneficial metabolic effects and, ultimately, will stimulate the recovery process in those patients who need it most, remains to be elucidated. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{family of}} the {{aromatic}} amino acid hydroxylases (AAAH) is well studied in mammals. It includes four members, i. e. phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and the tryptophan hydroxylases (TPH 1 and 2). These enzymes share important features, such as domain organization, three dimensional structure and mechanism of the reaction. The AAAH have important functions and are related to genetic human diseases. PAH, expressed in liver, {{is in charge of}} L-Phe catabolism from the diet and mutations in the PAH gene lead to phenylketonuria (PKU), a paradigm for genetic metabolic diseases. TH and the TPHs are enzymes of the neuroendocrine system, that carry out the rate limiting steps in the synthesis of neurotransmitters and hormones, i. e. catecholamines (TH) and serotonin and melatonin (TPHs). Mutations in TH and the TPHs genes are also involved in important neurological diseases and disorders, such as some forms of dystonia and parkinsonism in the case of TH and mood disorders in TPH. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a model organism widely used in biology. We here present the expression and characterization of two AAAH from the nematode, PAH and TH, in order to get insights into evolution of structure, function and regulation in this enzymatic family. In the case of PAH we found functional and molecular similarities between C. elegans PAH (cePAH) and human PAH (hPAH), although they display important differences in enzymatic activity regulation, especially regarding the regulation exerted by the substrate, L-Phe. Both the preactivation and the positive cooperativity induced by the substrate on mammalian PAHs were absent in cePAH. In vivo experiments with knock-out worms bearing a deletion in the pah gene (pah- 1) demonstrated that cePAH is involved in the synthesis of a melanin-like compound that localizes in the cuticle. The study of the recombinant TH from C. elegans (ceTH) in comparison with human TH (hTH) also revealed important differences at the level of short-term activity regulation. Basic regulatory mechanisms for hTH, such as substrate inhibition and <b>feed-back</b> <b>inhibition</b> by the end catecholamine products, appear to be absent in ceTH, suggesting a less tight regulation of enzymatic activity in the worm. But interestingly, ceTH was effectively phosphorylated by cAMPdependent protein kinase (PKA) at Ser 35, though this modification did not translate into activation of the enzyme in synergy with the <b>feed-back</b> <b>inhibition</b> by catecholamines, as it is the case for phosphorylation of hTH at the equivalent Ser 40. We hypothesised that phosphorylation of ceTH could regulate the interaction with other proteins and/or control subcellular localization. Supplementation with BH 4 has been recently established as a therapeutic intervention for PKU. A main effect of the cofactor is the stabilisation of misfolded PKU mutants, and BH 4 appears to function as a natural chaperone molecule. Since BH 4 is a shared cofactor by all the AAAH we set to investigate the effect of BH 4 supplementation on rat brain TH. Higher doses of BH 4 than those currently used for the treatment of PKU were needed to increase the cofactor concentration in brain, most probably due to the selectivity of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). This indicates that the current treatments using lower doses of BH 4 (up to 20 mg/kg/day) are not expected to affect neuronal TH and TPH 2. An increment of total TH protein and activity was measured in the brains of wild-type (wt) mice upon treatment with 100 mg BH 4 /kg/day, suggesting that BH 4 also functions as a natural chaperone in the case of TH. In agreement with these effects, in vitro experiments also showed the capability of BH 4 to stabilise TH. Finally, the screening of chemical libraries of small organic compounds is arising as a promising tool to find specific stabilisers of proteins (i. e. pharmacological chaperones). In the case of PAH, four stabilising compounds (compounds I-IV) were found in a previous study, revealing their potential as therapeutic pharmacological chaperones for PKU. As in the case of BH 4, it was interesting to study the effect of these four molecules upon neuronal TH and TPH 2. We found that compound III stabilized the three AAAH investigated, whereas the other compounds exerted different enzyme specific effects. In vivo studies with supplemented mice revealed the potential of compound III to treat TH-associated diseases. These results are important not only for the development of new specific therapies, but also to unravel enzyme specific/non specific ligand binding in the AAAH family...|$|E
