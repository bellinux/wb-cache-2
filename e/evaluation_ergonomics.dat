40|$|Anthropometric {{data are}} used by {{numerous}} types of organizations for health <b>evaluation,</b> <b>ergonomics,</b> apparel sizing, fitness training, and many other applications. Data have been collected and stored in electronic databases {{since at least the}} 1940 s. These databases are owned by many organizations around the world. In addition, the anthropometric studies stored in these databases often employ different standards, terminology, procedures, or measurement sets. To promote the use and sharing of these databases, the World Engineering Anthropometry Resources (WEAR) group was formed and tasked with the integration and publishing of member resources. It is easy to see that organizing worldwide anthropometric data into a single database architecture could be a daunting and expensive undertaking. The challenges of WEAR integration reflect mainly in the areas of distributed and disparate data, different standards and formats, independent memberships, and limited development resources. Fortunately, XML schema and web services provide an alternative method for networking databases, referred to as the Loosely Coupled WEAR Integration. A standard XML schema can be defined and used as a type of Rosetta stone to translate the anthropometric data into a universal format, and a web services system can be set up to link the databases to one another. In this way, the originators of the data can keep their data locally along with their own data management system and user interface, but their data can be searched and accessed as part of the larger data network, and even combined with the data of others. This paper will identify requirements for WEAR integration, review XML as the universal format, review different integration approaches, and propose a hybrid web services/data mart solution...|$|E

The virtual development process was mapped in observations of the use of virtual tools and interviews with actors involved in the verification. Results show that computer manikins are viable tools in verifying ergonomics early in a development process and that they help to detect many problems prior to physical pre-series. There are, however, substantial improvement potentials, both in the software itself and, even more, in the process of using virtual tools. The study identified several factors that can increase the reliability of the results of computer manikin simulations (e. g. participative ergonomics and documentation issues).

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper it was {{published}} in the book Work Design and Practice [© Taylor & Francis]. Computer Aided Design (CAD) is now firmly established in some industries as the normal method of originating and evaluating designs. Thus in aerospace it would be normal to have computer representations of proposed aircraft long before mock-ups or prototypes are available for functional evaluation. This implies that many aspects of the design may be finalised before there is any opportunity to carry out <b>ergonomics</b> <b>evaluations</b> of the work space or work tasks which will eventually confront the operator. Other industries are not so advanced in using computers in design, but would benefit from the ability to carry out <b>ergonomics</b> <b>evaluations</b> early in the design process. It is natural therefore to look for CAD systems which have the capability of considering human as well as mechanical, structural or other aspects of design. SAMMIE. System for Aiding Man-Machine Interaction Evaluation, is one such system which has been used in this way for some years. It assists in the building of a computer model of the workplace which can be viewed and manipulated on a graphics screen in ways which will be familiar to users of modern three-dimensional solid modelling systems.

Methods Our study subjects comprised of 1, 969 employees from the same Japanese company. The subjects were assessed using a questionnaire that covered both TRS and the work environment. TRS were measured from 4 items on the questionnaire. The work environment factors recorded were the daily mean duration of personal computer use, driving, precise work, commuting, time spent at home before going to bed, sleeping, attending business meetings, and performing physical labor. Statistical analysis was performed using t -tests, Chi-square tests, and logistic regression analyses. A result with P [*] Results The median total score on the 4 items used to assess TRS was 5 (25 %[*]=[*] 4, 75 %[*]=[*] 7). Two groups were defined such that the participants scoring ≤ 7 were assigned to the low-TRS group and those scoring ≥ 8, to the high-TRS group. The high-TRS group constituted 22. 6 % of the subjects.

30|$|As {{with other}} bench tests, the main {{limitations}} {{of our study}} may concern the inability to extrapolate our results to the real clinical situation. First, our technical evaluation was performed on a model, which cannot mimic the complexity of all interactions between a patient and a ventilator. The ASL 5000 is a simulator and it remains different from patients, mainly because the spontaneous inspiratory profile is not modified by pressurization during the inspiratory phase. However, the bench simulates most other situations and combinations that can be encountered in the clinical field. Second, the objective and subjective ergonomics measurements were assessed during standardized conditions that may be considered as different from real-life conditions. In {{order to be able}} to use various physiological sensors during the <b>ergonomics</b> <b>evaluation,</b> we chose not to use a high-fidelity environment with a manikin. We do agree with the fact that human behaviour under test may be significantly affected by the context and set-up of the experiment. However, while we only included experts, it would have been difficult to reach our experimental goals while also trying to run after a more important degree of immersion that may not be necessary with these types of physicians. A simulated condition may never reproduce all the complexities of the interactions between a patient, a clinician and a ventilator, especially if the tester is an experienced clinician [39]. There are many techniques available for usability evaluation, such as cognitive walk-through, expert reviews, focus groups, Delphi technique, heuristic evaluation or objective timed tasks completion, all of them providing different information [38]. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the only one to provide a global and complete <b>ergonomics</b> <b>evaluation,</b> taking into account different techniques. Third, we may also consider that the small number of senior ICU physicians that were included in our study does not enable firm conclusions to be drawn. Considering the design of the <b>ergonomics</b> <b>evaluation,</b> it required a huge amount of dedicated time from the physicians to undergo the different scenarios and various measurements for the experimental team. Moreover, none of them were familiar with the six tested devices, which exacerbated the difficulty in recruitment. It was therefore unrealistic to use more testers, and such a drawback also tended to be limited by the use of a device that was known to everyone as a comparison and by the fact that we included physicians from five different ICUs. The pairwise comparison that is performed while using the NASA-TLX also limits inter-/intra-individual variability. Finally, the use of the Avea as a ‘reference’ also depicts a specific limitation about the use of subjective psycho-cognitive scales. The better results of the Avea, with both the SUS and the NASA-TLX, clearly indicate that these values may be highly influenced by previous experience. Such a bias was limited within our evaluation by the fact that, in an attempt to assess the ease of use, we only included naive subjects in order to limit the impact of such experience on the evaluation.|$|R
