50|$|The {{shapes of}} <b>inferior</b> <b>mirage</b> sunsets and sunrises {{stay the same}} for all <b>inferior</b> <b>mirage</b> sunsets and sunrises. One {{well-known}} shape, the Etruscan vase, was named by Jules Verne.As the sunset progresses the shape of Etruscan vase slowly changes; the stem of the vase gets shorter until the real and the miraged Suns create a new shape - Greek letter omega Ω. The <b>inferior</b> <b>mirage</b> got its name because the inverted image appearsbelow the erect one.|$|E
5000|$|For {{exhausted}} travelers in the desert, an <b>inferior</b> <b>mirage</b> {{may appear}} to be a lake of water in the distance. An <b>inferior</b> <b>mirage</b> is called [...] "inferior" [...] because the mirage is located under the real object. The real object in an <b>inferior</b> <b>mirage</b> is the (blue) sky or any distant (therefore bluish) object in that same direction. The mirage causes the observer to see a bright and bluish patch {{on the ground in the}} distance.|$|E

40|$|<b>Inferior</b> <b>mirages</b> over sun-exposed roads {{often appear}} in {{isolated}} strips at their near sides and the reflected scenery exhibits multiple images.

These kinds of <b>inferior</b> <b>mirages</b> are often called [...] "desert mirages" [...] or [...] "highway mirages". Both sand and tarmac can become very hot when exposed to the sun, easily being more than 10 °C hotter than the air one meter above, enough to create {{conditions}} suitable {{for the formation of}} the mirage.|$|R

50|$|A mock mirage {{of astronomical}} objects {{is much more}} complex than an <b>inferior</b> <b>mirage.</b> While an <b>inferior</b> <b>mirage</b> of astronomical objects can produce only two images, a mock mirage can produce {{multiple}} miraged images. The shapes of the miraged object are changing constantly and unpredictably. In order for a mock mirage to appear, the cooler air needs to be trapped below the inversion. Several inversion layers produce multiple pancake-like shapes.|$|E

50|$|In meteorology, {{instability}} can {{be described}} by various indices such as the Bulk Richardson Number, lifted index, K-index, convective available potential energy (CAPE), the Showalter, and the Vertical totals. These indices, as well as atmospheric instability itself, involve temperature changes through the troposphere with height, or lapse rate. Effects of atmospheric instability in moist atmospheres include thunderstorm development, which over warm oceans can lead to tropical cyclogenesis, and turbulence. In dry atmospheres, <b>inferior</b> <b>mirages,</b> dust devils, steam devils, and fire whirls can form. Stable atmospheres {{can be associated with}} drizzle, fog, increased air pollution, a lack of turbulence, and undular bore formation.|$|R
50|$|A {{superior}} mirage {{occurs when the}} air below the line of sight is colder than the air above it. This unusual arrangement is called a temperature inversion, since warm air above cold air {{is the opposite of}} the normal temperature gradient of the atmosphere. Passing through the temperature inversion, the light rays are bent down, and so the image appears above the true object, hence the name superior. Superior mirages are in general less common than <b>inferior</b> <b>mirages,</b> but, when they do occur, they tend to be more stable, as cold air has no tendency to move up and warm air has no tendency to move down.|$|R
40|$|Within {{the marine}} {{atmospheric}} surface layer {{it is possible}} for a single camera to deduce passively the range to a point target. Although this range determination would appear impossible at first glance, such a measurement exploits the common occurrence of sub-refractive propagation conditions in the marine environment. A calculation of the range to an object utilizes a geometric optics determination of slight angular differences between two different ray trajectories to the object. This is most commonly done with the assumption of Euclidean or ‘free-space’ conditions. In this paper we utilize the phenomenon of <b>inferior</b> <b>mirages</b> to provide two different ray-paths to an imaging sensor. The primary assumption is that the environment containing the path from camera (or eye) to target is homogeneous (but not isotropic) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Inferior</b> <b>mirage</b> {{of astronomical}} objects {{is the most}} common mirage. <b>Inferior</b> <b>mirage</b> occurs when the surface of the Earth or the oceans {{produces}} a layer of hot air of lower density, just at the surface. There are two images, the inverted one and the erect one, in inferior mirage.They both are displaced from the geometric direction to the actual object. While the erect image is setting, the inverted image appears to be rising from the surface.|$|E
50|$|Heat haze, {{also called}} heat shimmer, {{refers to the}} <b>inferior</b> <b>mirage</b> {{experienced}} when viewing objects through a layer of heated air; for example, viewing objects across hot asphalt or through the exhaust gases produced by jet engines. When appearing on roads due to the hot asphalt, it {{is often referred to}} as a highway mirage.|$|E

5000|$|Within an {{unstable}} layer in the troposphere, {{the lifting of}} air parcels will occur, and continue {{for as long as}} the nearby atmosphere remains unstable. Once overturning through the depth of the troposphere occurs (with convection being capped by the relatively warmer, more stable layer of the stratosphere), deep convective currents lead to thunderstorm development when enough moisture is present. Over warm ocean waters and within a region of the troposphere with light vertical wind shear and significant low level spin (or vorticity), such thunderstorm activity can grow in coverage and develop into a tropical cyclone. [...] Over hot surfaces during warm days, unstable dry air can lead to significant refraction of the light within the air layer, which causes <b>inferior</b> <b>mirages.</b>|$|R

Andy Young writes, [...] "They're always confined to a narrow strip of sky—less than a finger's width at arm's length—at the horizon." ...|$|R
5000|$|A Fata Morgana (...) is {{an unusual}} and complex form of {{superior}} mirage that is seen in a narrow band right above the horizon. It is the Italian name for the Arthurian sorceress Morgan le Fay, from a belief that these mirages, often seen in the Strait of Messina, were fairy castles in the air or false land created by her witchcraft to lure sailors to their deaths. Although the term Fata Morgana is sometimes applied to other, more common kinds of mirages, the true Fata Morgana is different from both an ordinary superior mirage and an <b>inferior</b> <b>mirage.</b>|$|E
50|$|Many tend {{to believe}} that seeing a green flash brings good luck. Stories are told,By Sailors of old,Who sought more than distant shore.When looking aseaAlert ye be,And by chance ye might see more.At setting sun When day is done,While {{lanyards}} ye do lash.Where sea meets skyKeep watchful eyeFor the Mystical Green Flash. If luck be thereAnd it catch your stare,Your fortune turns my mate.Night sky is redSmooth sail ahead,A charmed life is your fate.Sure as Neptune guidesThe ocean tides,Where his dolphins leap and splash.Favorable daysAwait those who gaze'Pon the Mystical Green Flash. Green flashes might be observed from any place with a low horizon. Deserts, oceans and ice shelves are probably the best places to observe mirages and therefore green flashes. It is easier not to miss a green flash during sunset than during sunrise. It is especially true regarding an <b>inferior</b> <b>mirage</b> green flash, when the timing should be just right to capture it at sunrise. I could see the sun glowing below the distant horizon. Then, for what seemed like at least a second, the green flash flooded the desert like an alien heliograph. A moment later, the skyline erupted with the instant magnificence of the sun, its sudden warmth. From the above observation {{it is clear that the}} author observed an <b>inferior</b> <b>mirage</b> green flash, when the much warmer surface of the desert with the help of the rising Sun was fighting the cool morning air, producing in the process a green flash - one of nature's great spectacles.|$|E

The uppermost inset frame shows an <b>inferior</b> <b>mirage</b> of the Farallon Islands. The second inset frame is the Farallon Islands with a green flash on the left-hand side. The two lower frames and the main frame all show superior mirages of the Farallon Islands. In these three frames, the superior mirages evolve from a 3-image mirage (an inverted image between two erect ones) to a 5-image mirage, and then back to a 2-image mirage. Such a display is consistent with a Fata Morgana. All frames but the upper one were photographed from about 50-70 feet above sea level. The upper frame was photographed from sea level.|$|E
5000|$|A Fata Morgana is {{an unusual}} and very complex form of mirage, a form of {{superior}} mirage, which, like many other kinds of superior mirages, is seen in a narrow band right above the horizon. It is an Italian phrase derived from the vulgar Latin for [...] "fairy" [...] and the Arthurian sorcerer Morgan le Fay, from {{a belief that the}} mirage, often seen in the Strait of Messina, were fairy castles in the air, or false land designed to lure sailors to their death created by her witchcraft. Although the term Fata Morgana is sometimes incorrectly applied to other, more common kinds of mirages, the true Fata Morgana {{is not the same as}} an ordinary superior mirage, and is certainly not the same as an <b>inferior</b> <b>mirage.</b>|$|E
50|$|A Fata Morgana {{can go from}} {{superior}} to <b>inferior</b> <b>mirage</b> and back within a few seconds, depending on the constantly changing conditions of the atmosphere. Sixteen frames of the mirage of the Farallon Islands, which cannot be seen from sea level at all under normal conditions because they are located below the horizon, were photographed on the same day. The first fourteen frames have elements of a Fata Morgana display—alternations of compressed and stretched zones. The last two frames were photographed {{a few hours later}} around sunset. The air was cooler while the ocean was probably a little bit warmer, which made temperature inversion lower. The mirage was still present, but it was not as complex as it had been a few hours before sunset, and it corresponded no longer to a Fata Morgana but rather to a superior mirage display.|$|E
5000|$|Joshua {{launched}} a surprise {{attack on the}} Amorites following a night march, causing the Amorites to panic and flee as far as Beth-horon, {{but they did not}} find a safe haven there. ..."they were more who died with the hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword." [...] "Hailstones" [...] are a rare event in the deserts and are a good precondition for creating a mock/superior mirage of the setting sun. <b>Inferior</b> <b>mirage</b> is the most common mirage in the deserts. When Israelites went from a hot desert to a hail-covered desert to fight the Amorites, the inversion layers might have created a mock mirage of the setting sun. To the Israelites, the sun appeared to stand still. A poem is quoted from the Book of Jasher, which states that the sun stood still at Gibeon, and the moon in the valley of Ajalon, in order that Joshua could complete the battle.|$|E
