5|$|The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism was Weber's {{third major}} {{work on the}} {{sociology}} of religion. In this work he deals with the structure of Indian society, with the orthodox <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> Hinduism and the heterodox <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> Buddhism, with modifications brought by the influence of popular religiosity and finally {{with the impact of}} religious beliefs on the secular ethic of Indian society. In Weber's view, Hinduism in India, like Confucianism in China, was a barrier for capitalism. The Indian caste system made it very difficult for individuals to advance in the society beyond their caste. Activity, including economic activity, was seen as unimportant {{in the context of the}} advancement of the soul.|$|E

5|$|St. Augustine (354430) {{believed}} that the determinism of astrology conflicted with the Christian <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> man's free will and responsibility, and God not being the cause of evil, but he also grounded his opposition philosophically, citing the failure of astrology to explain twins who behave differently although conceived {{at the same moment}} and born at approximately the same time.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{served as}} a Ruling Elder at the Presbyterian General Assembly of 1832, then {{relocated}} to Princeton, New Jersey, to study under Samuel Miller at Princeton Theological Seminary. In November 1832, he succeeded his brother John as pastor of Second Presbyterian Church of Baltimore, Maryland. His tenure saw numerous converts, but he was put at odds with his brother and Samuel Miller over practices employed in his church. His counselors were also concerned that he was wavering on {{his belief in the}} doctrine of limited atonement. Eventually, he was persuaded back into the <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> the orthodox Calvinism and became {{one of the leaders of}} the Old School Presbyterian movement.|$|E

40|$|The Bible {{as a whole}} {{establishes}} the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. The New Testament <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin is developed on {{the foundation of the}} Old Testament <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. Paul and John speak particularly on the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole. So a study <b>of</b> their <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin would contribute to a total Biblical understanding. The problem of this study is the Biblical <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin limited to the New Testament writers, John and Paul, as they speak <b>of</b> the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin, in relation to the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole. Since the problem concerns the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as stated by the New Testament writers, John and Paul, in relation to the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole, it is necessary to consider several definite facts. In order to understand sin it is first necessary to show its relationship to man in a study of theological anthropology. It is also necessary to show the relationship of Paul and John 2 ̆ 7 s <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. In order to correctly understand either John or Paul 2 ̆ 7 s <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin it is first necessary to review the Bible teaching regarding man in relation to sin. The <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin is not understood apart from man. The study of man in relation to sin is titled 2 ̆ 2 Theological Anthropology. 2 ̆ 2 It is presented as the first study in order to fully understand man in relation to the biblical <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. Man 2 ̆ 7 s origin, man as a sinner and man under grace are the three aspects of this study of theological anthropology. John and Paul are generally recognized as the main theologians in the New Testament. John 2 ̆ 7 s purpose in writing the Gospel was to convince the reader that this was the Christ and that believing he should have eternal life. His purpose in the First Epistle was the enhance his joy, to keep the Christian from sin, to lead them into an assurance of salvation and to warn them against error. Certain aspects <b>of</b> the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin are still presented in the Gospel. More <b>of</b> the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin appears in the First Epistle of John. Therefore it is necessary to study the terms which mean sin or describe certain aspects of sin in order to discern John 2 ̆ 7 s <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole...|$|R
5|$|Control over {{propaganda}} {{is another}} matter. When forming his argument here, Russell specifically targets the <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> John Stuart Mill. Russell argues that Mill's {{argument for the}} freedom of speech is too weak, so long as it is balanced against the harm principle; for any speech worth protecting for political reasons is likely to cause somebody harm. For example, the citizen ought {{to have the opportunity to}} impeach malicious governors, but that would surely harm the governor, at the very least (Russell 1938:179).|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Cumberland Presbytery, also {{within the}} Kentucky Synod, faced a {{shortage}} of ministers and decided to license clergy candidates who were less educated than was typical and who could not subscribe completely to the Westminster Confession. In 1805, the synod suspended many of these ministers, even bringing heresy charges against a number of them, and by 1806 the synod had dissolved the presbytery. In 1810, ministers dissatisfied with {{the actions of the}} synod formed the Cumberland Presbyterian Church (CPC). The CPC subscribed to a modified form of the Westminster Confession that rejected the Calvinist <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> double predestination and limited atonement.|$|E
5|$|Military rule {{ended in}} 1983, and the radical Raúl Alfonsín was elected president. Menem ran for {{governor}} again, and was elected by a clear margin. The province benefited from tax regulations established by the military, which allowed increased industrial growth. His party got control of the provincial legislature, and he was re-elected in 1987 with 63% of the vote. The PJ was divided in two factions, the conservatives that still supported the political <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> Juan and Isabel Perón, and those who proposed a renovation of the party. The internal disputes ceased in 1987. Menem, with his prominent victory in his district, {{was one of the}} leading figures of the party, and disputed its leadership.|$|E

5|$|The term baptism {{with the}} Holy Spirit {{originates}} in the New Testament, and all Christian traditions {{accept it as}} a theological concept. Nevertheless, different Christian denominations and traditions have interpreted its meaning {{in a variety of}} ways due to differences in the <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> salvation and ecclesiology. As a result, Spirit baptism has been variously defined as part of the sacraments of initiation into the church, as being synonymous with regeneration, as being synonymous with Christian perfection, or as being a second work of grace that empowers a person for Christian life and service.|$|E

5|$|Two-level utilitarianism is {{virtually}} {{a synthesis of}} the opposing <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> act utilitarianism and rule utilitarianism. Act utilitarianism states that in all cases the morally right action is the one which produces the most pleasure, whereas rule utilitarianism states that the morally right action {{is the one that}} is in accordance with a moral rule whose general observance would create the most happiness. In terms of two-level utilitarianism, act utilitarianism can be likened to the 'critical' level of moral thinking, and rule utilitarianism to the 'intuitive' level.|$|E
5|$|While Briggs held to {{traditional}} Christian teaching in many areas, {{such as his}} belief in the virgin birth of Jesus, conservatives were alarmed by his assertion that doctrines were historical constructs that had to change over time. He did not believe that the Pentateuch was authored by Moses or that the book of Isaiah had a single author. In addition, he also denied that biblical prophecy was a precise prediction of the future. In 1891, Briggs preached a sermon in which he claimed the Bible contained errors, a position many in the church considered contrary to the Westminster Confession's <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> verbal inspiration and biblical inerrancy.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{doctrine}} of karma is central to all Indian religions, {{it is difficult to}} say when and where in India the concept of karma originated. In Jainism, it is assumed its development took place in an era from which the literary documents are not available, since the basics of this doctrine were present and concluded even in the earliest documents of Jains. Acaranga Sutra and Sutrakritanga, contain a general outline of the <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> karma and reincarnation. The roots of this doctrine in Jainism might be in the teachings of Parsva, who is said to have lived about two hundred fifty years before Mahavira. The Jain conception of karma—as something material that encumbers the soul—has an archaic nature which justifies the hypothesis that it goes back to 8th or 9th century BCE.|$|E
5|$|From 1785 to 1799, Garrard {{served as}} a trustee of Transylvania Seminary (now Transylvania University). In 1794, the Baptist and more liberal {{trustees}} united against the orthodox Presbyterian {{members of the board}} to elect the seminary's first non-Presbyterian president. That president was Harry Toulmin, a Unitarian minister from England. Toulmin's daughter Lucinda would later marry Garrard's son Daniel. As a result of Garrard's relationship with Toulmin, he began to accept some tenets of Unitarianism, specifically the <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> Socinianism. By 1802, Garrard and Augustine Eastin had not only adopted these beliefs, but had indoctrinated their Baptist congregations with them. The Elkhorn Baptist Association condemned these beliefs as heretical and encouraged Garrard and Eastin to abandon them. When that effort failed, the Association ceased correspondence and association with both men. This event ended Garrard's ministry and his association with the Baptist church.|$|E
5|$|On {{arriving}} in Oxford, Vermigli began lecturing on 1 Corinthians, denouncing Catholic <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> purgatory, clerical celibacy, and lenten fasting. He then spoke against the Catholic {{doctrine of the}} Eucharist, the most sensitive area of disagreement between Protestants and Catholics in England at the time. Conservative faculty, led by Smyth, challenged Vermigli to defend his views in a formal disputation. Smyth fled to St Andrews and finally to Leuven before the disputation could be held, so three Catholic divines, William Tresham, William Chedsey and Morgan Phillips, stepped forward to take his place. The disputation was held in 1549 before Richard Cox, the University Chancellor and a firm Protestant. It focused on the doctrine of transubstantiation, with Vermigli's opponents arguing for it and him against. Chancellor Cox made it obvious that he considered Vermigli to have the better argument, but did not formally declare a winner. The disputation put Vermigli {{at the forefront of}} debates over the nature of the Eucharist.|$|E
