40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} a novel inhibitor of angiogenesis, <b>Irsogladine,</b> an anti-ulcer drug. <b>Irsogladine</b> inhibited plasminogen activator synthesis of, and tube formation by, human microvascular endothelial cells in type 1 collagen gel treated with an angiogenic growth factor, EGF. Furthermore, <b>Irsogladine</b> administered orally significantly inhibited in vivo angiogenesis in mice. <b>Irsogladine</b> {{may be useful}} in the treatment of diseases associated with angiogenesis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Irsogladine</b> is a {{commonly}} used anti-gastric ulcer agent in Japan, and recent in vivo {{studies have shown}} it to have anti-angiogenic properties. The exact role of <b>irsogladine</b> as an inhibitor of angiogenesis remains uncertain. In this study, we show that <b>irsogladine</b> inhibited breast cancer regrowth and pulmonary metastasis but had no anti-angiogenic function against HUVEC cells. <b>Irsogladine</b> failed to inhibit proliferation, tubular formation, and the uPA/MMP- 1 mRNA expression of HUVEC cells. We also examined the effect of <b>irsogladine</b> in an orthotopic transplant model of human breast cancer metastasis in athymic mice. Human MDA-MB- 435 cells were injected into the mammary fat pads. After 9 weeks, the tumors were resected under general anesthesia. <b>Irsogladine</b> or vehicle was given p. o. daily thereafter. Daily administration of <b>irsogladine</b> at 120 mg/kg per day over a 5 -week period {{had no effect on}} the body weight of the mice. Tumor regrowth, average volume of pulmonary metastases, and the number of metastases were inhibited by 40, 48 and 64 %, respectively. These results suggest that <b>irsogladine</b> may be useful in the breast cancer adjuvant setting...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the mucosal protective effect and {{the mechanisms of}} action of the anti-ulcer drug <b>irsogladine</b> maleate in gastric injury induced by indomethacin in rats. METHODS: Gastric mucosal injury was induced in male Hos:Donryu rats by oral administration of indomethacin at a dose of 48 mg/kg. One hour before indomethacin treatment, animals were orally pretreated with <b>irsogladine</b> maleate at doses of 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg. Four hours after indomethacin administration, the animals were sacrificed and their stomachs were rapidly removed and processed {{for the evaluation of}} gastric mucosal damage and the determination of the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β), IL- 8 and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in mucosal tissues. RESULTS: Linear hemorrhagic mucosal lesions were observed primarily in the glandular stomach 4 h after oral administration of indomethacin. Pretreatment with <b>irsogladine</b> maleate markedly reduced the number and severity of these lesions in a dose-dependent manner. The mucosal concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL- 1 β, and IL- 8) and MPO, which indicates the degree of mucosal infiltration by neutrophils, increased concomitantly with the occurrence of gastric injury in the indomethacin-treated rats. Pretreatment with <b>irsogladine</b> maleate significantly decreased the levels of these inflammatory factors in gastric tissue elicited by indomethacin. CONCLUSION: The mucosal protective effects afforded by <b>irsogladine</b> maleate on gastric injury induced by indomethacin are mediated by inhibition of mucosal proinflammatory cytokine production and neutrophil infiltration, leading to suppression of mucosal inflammation and subsequent tissue destruction...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEpithelial cells {{function}} as mechanical barriers against invasion by pathogenic organisms and promote intercellular communication through cell–cell junction complexes. Therefore, the permeability of the gingival epithelial cell layer indicates a defensive capability against invasion by periodontal pathogens. Accumulation of activated neutrophils {{is thought to}} be involved in the onset of inflammation. Here, we review the effects of <b>irsogladine</b> maleate, a medication for gastric ulcers, on E-cadherin and chemokine expression in gingival epithelial cells exposed to periodontopathogenic bacteria, in order to examine the clinical efficacy of <b>irsogladine</b> maleate in preventing periodontal inflammation...|$|E

40|$|Neurodegeneration of the {{substantia nigra}} (SN) {{particularly}} its pars compacta (SNpc) region disrupts control of motor function, {{as seen in}} Parkinson's disease (PD). Nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation results in decreased dopamine levels in the striatum translating to inadequate dopaminergic signalling. Dopaminergic receptor signalling employs cAMP as a secondary messenger whose levels are regulated by cAMP degrading phosphodiesterase (PDE). Differentiated SH-SY 5 Y neuronal cell-lines were used to check novel drug candidates against parkinsonian neurotoxin (1 -Methyl 4 -Phenylpyridinium (MPP+)) -induced neuronal cell death. 1 -methyl- 4 -phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treated mouse model of Parkinson's disease {{was used to assess}} the molecules’ effect on behavioural motor function using akinesia, catalepsy, swim, pole, open field and rotarod tests with ANY-maze software, cAMP levels in the striatum by spectrophotometric ELISA, PDE inhibitory activity by radiometric enzyme assay, striatal dopamine and serotonin neurochemistry as well as hydroxyl radical estimation by HPLC-electrochemistry and dopaminergic neuron survival in the SN by tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry. <b>Irsogladine</b> was found to possess desirable characteristics such as: crossing of the blood brain barrier, PDE inhibitory property, radical scavenging ability, protection against striatal DA depletion, rescue SNpc dopaminergic neurons against degeneration and finally MPTP-induced behavioural dysfunctions. Four derivatives of Irsogladine; JVIR 1, JVIR 2, JVIR 3 and PJD 9 also show protection in the MPTP model demonstrating that shifting the Cl at position 5 to the 4 th position of the dichlorophenyl ring of <b>Irsogladine</b> to aquire 6 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 3, 5 -triazine- 2, 4 -diamine (JVIR 1) or removing both the Cl atoms on the dichlorophenyl ring of <b>Irsogladine</b> and replacing them with a single Br at the 2 nd position of the phenyl ring to get 6 -(2 -bromophenyl) - 1, 3, 5 -triazine- 2, 4 -diamine (JVIR 2) or a single Br at the 4 th position of the phenyl ring to yield 6 -(4 -bromophenyl) - 1, 3, 5 -triazine- 2, 4 -diamine (JVIR 3) or removal of all the halogens on the phenyl ring to get 6 -phenyl- 1, 3, 5 -triazine- 2, 4 -diamine (PJD 9) does not interfere with the antiparkinsonian activity of the general structure or at least does not lead to loss of anti-parkinsonian activity. Removal of the phenyl ring and replacing it with either a methyl or methyl indolyl group to get PJD 8 and PJD 10 resulted in reduced antiparkinsonian activity. PJD 8 and PJD 10 probably do not influence striatal dopaminergic signalling via the elevation of cAMP and or DA. The two molecules do demonstrate marginal rescue from parkinsonian phenotype at the highest doses and further investigation on the underlying mechanism would help in lowering the doses or enhancing their activity...|$|E
40|$|Intraluminal {{pressure}} elevation {{can cause}} degenerative disorders, such as ileus and hydronephrosis, and the threshold is fairly low and constant, 20 – 30 cm H 2 O. We previously devised a novel two-chamber culture system subjecting cells cultured on a semipermeable membrane to increased culture medium height (water pressure up to 60 cm H 2 O). Here, {{we sought to}} determine how a continuous pressure load of ~ 30 cm H 2 O affects proliferating epithelial cells with special interest in the link with cell morphology. We cultured several different cell lines using the low static pressure-loadable two-chamber system, and examined cell growth, cell cycle, and cell morphology. Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) columnar epithelial cells were growth-suppressed in a manner dependent on static water pressure ranging from 2 to 50 cm H 2 O, without cell cycle arrest at any specific phase. Two other types of columnar epithelial cells exhibited similar phenotypes. By contrast, spherical epithelial and mesenchymal cells were not growth-suppressed, even at 50 cm H 2 O. Phalloidin staining revealed that 50 cm H 2 O pressure load vertically flattened and laterally widened columnar epithelial cells and made actin fiber distribution sparse, without affecting total phalloidin intensity per cell. When the mucosal protectant <b>irsogladine</b> maleate (100 nM) was added to 50 -cm-high culture medium, MDCK cells were reduced in volume and their doubling time shortened. Cell proliferation and morphology {{are known to be}} regulated by the Hippo signaling pathway. A pressure load of 50 cm H 2 O enhanced serine- 127 phosphorylation and cytoplasmic retention of YAP, the major constituent of this pathway, suggesting that Hippo pathway was involved in the pressure-induced cell growth suppression. RNA sequencing of MDCK cells showed that a 50 cm H 2 O pressure load upregulated keratin 14, an intermediate filament, 12 -fold. This upregulation was confirmed at the protein level by immunofluorescence, suggesting a role in cytoskeletal reinforcement. These results provide evidence that cell morphology and the cytoskeleton are closely linked to cell growth. Pathological intraluminal pressure elevation may cause mucosal degeneration by acting directly on this linkage and the Hippo pathway...|$|E
