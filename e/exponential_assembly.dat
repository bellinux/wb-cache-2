Eric Drexler published in Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing and Computation (1992), a notable work of [...] "exploratory engineering". During the last decade, others have extended the nanofactory concept, including an analysis of nanofactory convergent assembly by Ralph Merkle, a systems design of a replicating nanofactory architecture by J. Storrs Hall, Forrest Bishop's [...] "Universal Assembler", the patented <b>exponential</b> <b>assembly</b> process by Zyvex, and a top-level systems design for a 'primitive nanofactory' by Chris Phoenix (Director of Research at the Center for Responsible Nanotechnology). All of these nanofactory designs (and more) are summarized in Chapter 4 of Kinematic Self-Replicating Machines (2004) by Robert Freitas and Ralph Merkle. The Nanofactory Collaboration, founded by Freitas and Merkle in 2000, is a focused ongoing effort involving 23 researchers from 10 organizations and 4 countries that is developing a practical research agenda specifically aimed at positionally-controlled diamond mechanosynthesis and diamondoid nanofactory development.|$|E

I. T. The lattices consisted of 0. 25 -inch-diameter rods in two U 2 3 5 concentrations, 1. 143 % and 1. 027 %, and three spacings, 1. 25, 1. 75 and 2. 50 inches.

40|$|Measurements of the {{intracellular}} {{distribution of}} the activation of foils by neutrons were made in lattices of 1 / 4 -inch diameter, 1. 03 % U- 235, uranium rods moderated by heavy water, with bare and cadmium-covered foils of gold, depleted uranium, lutetium, europium and copper. The measurements {{were made in the}} M. I. T. Heavy Water Lattice Facility with source neutrons from the M. I. T. Reactor. Two lattices were studied in detail in this work. The more closely packed lattice had a triangular spacing of 1. 25 inches, and the less closely packed lattice had a triangular spacing of 2. 5 inches. The results of the experiments were compared to one-dimensional, 30 -energy group, THERMOS calculations based on the available energy exchange kernels. The comparison indicated that the approximation that the hexagonal cell may be replaced by an equivalent circular cell (the Wigner-Seitz approximation) can lead to serious discrepancies in closely packed lattices moderated b! y heavy water. A modified one-dimensional, and a two-dimensional, calculation were shown to predict the intracellular activation distribution in the closely packed lattice. An analytical treatment of the problem of the flux perturbation in a foil was developed and compared to the experimental results obtained by using gold foils of four different thicknesses in the lattice cell; the method was shown to be adequate. An analytical method to treat the effect of leakage from an <b>exponential</b> <b>assembly</b> was formulated; the results indicated that only in small exponential assemblies would leakage be a significant problem in intracellular flux measurements. A method was developed to predict the cadmium ratio of the foils used in the lattice cell; comparison with available measurements with gold foils indicated good agreement between theory and experiment, except for a lattice having very large ratios of moderator volume, to fuel volume, e. g., 100 : 1. Calculations of the fuel disadvantage factor by the method of successive generations for gold, lutetium and europium detector foils were compared to the results of THERMOS calculations, because THERMOS was shown to predict the experimental distributions. The comparison indicated that the method of successive generations is a good alternative to the THERMOS calculation, if all that is required is 17 and the thermal utilization.

40|$|A moments {{method has}} been {{developed}} {{for the analysis of}} flux distributions in subcritical neutron-multiplying assemblies. The method determines values of the asymptotic axial and radial buckling, and of the extrapolated height and radius, from foil activation data, in terms of flux moments defined in the usual sense. Analytic expressions are derived for the axial and radial buckling and extrapolated dimensions in terms of the flux moments. These expressions have clear physical meaning and are suitable for the interpretation of conventional buckling measurements. The method treats the moment index as a variable parameter and allows freedom in the choice of the locations of the first and last data points used in the analysis. These degrees of freedom make it possible to reduce the effects of source neutrons, flux transients, and higher harmonics. As a result, the moments method can be applied successfully to very small lattices ("miniature lattices") as well as to large <b>exponential</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The moments method has been tested, in comparison with the conventional least-squares curve-fitting method, by applying the two methods to the analysis of measurements made in several uranium heavy water, and uranium oxide-heavy water lattices investigated at the M. I. T. Lattice Project. In the case of large <b>exponential</b> <b>assemblies,</b> the moments method yielded more consistent results than the curve-fitting method. In the case of miniature lattices, the moments method made it possible {{for the first time to}} determine values of axial and radial buckling and extrapolated dimensions.
