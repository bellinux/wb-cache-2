25|$|Carson's show {{launched}} {{the careers of}} many performers, especially comedians and musicians.

Most notable among these were David Letterman, Jay Leno, Jerry Seinfeld, Jeff Foxworthy, Ellen DeGeneres, Joan Rivers, David Brenner, Tim Allen, Drew Carey, and Roseanne Barr.

He rescued Max Perutz from internment, <b>getting</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> perform experiments in a meat store freezer below Smithfield Meat Market. This project indirectly marked his divergence from Zuckerman, when he was recalled from a joint tour of the Middle East investigating the cooperation of army and air force, although the tour established Zuckerman's reputation as a military scientist.|$|E

500|$|After winning {{his second}} world title, he {{embarked}} on a European tour which took him all over the Continent. Robinson traveled with his flamingo-pink Cadillac, which caused quite a stir in Paris, and an entourage of 13 people, some included [...] "just for laughs". He was a hero in France due to his recent defeat of LaMotta—the French hated LaMotta for defeating Marcel Cerdan in 1949 and taking his championship belt (Cerdan {{died in a plane}} crash en route to a rematch with LaMotta). Robinson met President of France Vincent Auriol at a ceremony attended by France's social upper crust. During his fight in Berlin against Gerhard Hecht, Robinson was disqualified when he knocked his opponent with a punch to the kidney: a punch legal in the US, but not Europe. The fight was later declared a no-contest. In London, Robinson lost the world middleweight title to British boxer Randolph Turpin in a sensational bout. Three months later in a rematch in front of 60,000 fans at the Polo Grounds, he knocked Turpin out in ten rounds to recover the title. In that bout Robinson was leading on the cards but was cut by Turpin. With the fight in jeopardy, Robinson let loose on Turpin, knocking him down, then <b>getting</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the ropes and unleashing a series of punches that caused the referee to stop the bout. Following Robinson's victory, residents of Harlem danced in the streets. In 1951, Robinson was named Ring Magazine's [...] "Fighter of the Year" [...] for the second time.|$|E
500|$|In {{a parody}} of The Devil and Daniel Webster, at work, Homer states that he would sell his soul for a {{doughnut}} after finding that Lenny and Carl took all the doughnuts and threw them at an old man (Grampa) [...] "for kicks". The devil, revealed to be Ned Flanders, appears and offers Homer a contract to seal the deal. However, before Homer finishes the doughnut, he realizes that Ned {{will not be able}} to have his soul if he does not eat all of the doughnut and keeps the final piece in the refrigerator. Unfortunately, while half-asleep and looking for a midnight snack, he eats the final piece of the [...] "forbidden donut", and Ned instantly reappears to take possession of Homer's soul. Marge and Lisa plead with Ned, finally <b>getting</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> agree to hold a trial the next day. Until then, Homer is sent to spend the rest of the day being punished in Hell. At the stroke of twelve midnight, Ned brings Homer back to the Simpson household for his trial. Then, when the Simpsons' lawyer, Lionel Hutz, flees after ruining his case, Marge makes a final effort to save Homer by displaying a photo from their wedding day. On the back of the photo, Homer has written that, in return for Marge giving him her hand in marriage, he pledges his soul to her forever; therefore, it was not his property to sell at the time of his deal with Ned. The jury rules in favor of the Simpsons and the presiding judge dismisses the case. Enraged, the Devil leaves, but gets his revenge by turning Homer's head into a doughnut.|$|E

[...] The next morning, the two friends meet up and start SpongeBob's first day of [...] "glorious unemployment," [...] or as Patrick likes to call it, [...] "Fun Employment." [...] Patrick demonstrates the following activities: 1.) Going to Squidward's garden and <b>getting</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> throw vegetables at them after ruining some of his flowers, 2.) Taking a [...] "siesta" [...] and 3.) Having a free lunch with friends at Sandy Cheeks' tree dome. Sandy, who is carrying out an experiment in nutrition, is surprised to see SpongeBob there, and tells SpongeBob that he should find a new job after she learns he was fired. After deciding that Sandy is right, SpongeBob thanks Patrick for trying to help him, but points out that while unemployment might be fun for him, SpongeBob needs a job. Patrick is fine with this and tells his best friend that he should do what he feels is right.|$|E
2500|$|Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes: The Bad, a ruthless, unfeeling, and sociopathic {{mercenary}} {{who always}} finishes {{a job he}} is paid for (which is usually finding—and killing—people). When Blondie and Tuco are captured while posing as Confederate soldiers, Angel Eyes is the Union sergeant who interrogates and has Tuco tortured, eventually learning {{the name of the}} cemetery where the gold is buried, but not the name on the tombstone. Angel Eyes forms a fleeting partnership with Blondie, but Tuco and Blondie turn on Angel Eyes when they get their chance. Originally, Leone wanted Enrico Maria Salerno (who had dubbed Eastwood's voice for the Italian versions of the Dollars Trilogy films) or Charles Bronson to play Angel Eyes, but the latter was already committed to playing in The Dirty Dozen (1967). Leone thought about working with Lee Van Cleef again: [...] "I said to myself that Van Cleef had first played a romantic character in For a Few Dollars More. The idea of <b>getting</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> play a character who was the opposite of that began to appeal to me." [...] In the original working script, Angel Eyes was named [...] "Banjo", but is referred to as [...] "Sentenza" [...] (meaning [...] "Sentence" [...] or [...] "Judgement") in the Italian version. Eastwood came up with the name Angel Eyes on the set, for his gaunt appearance and expert marksmanship.|$|E
2500|$|I {{talked to}} him (Dr. Scott) for some time, and {{consulted}} him about baby, who was looking thin and weak. (15 July)This evening I was standing outside the door with baby in my arms, talking to the ayah, when I felt something whiz past my ears. (23 July)A poor woman [...] [...] [...] whose husband [...] [...] [...] had been killed during the siege, came to-day {{to ask me to}} give her a little milk for her only child, who was dying for the want of proper nourishment. It went to my heart to refuse her; but at this time I had only just enough for my own children, and baby could not have lived without it. I think she understood that I would have given her some if I could. (14 August)The children still kept pretty well, though baby grew thinner every day; nothing I gave him seemed to nourish him. (28 August)As we were starting, Major Ouvry brought us some beer to drink, and poor baby, who was very thirsty, cried louder for it than I had ever heard him before. With difficulty I pacified him, and succeeded in <b>getting</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> sleep. Just then the word 'Halt!' was heard, and silence was ordered, all lights to be put out. It was evident some danger was apprehended, and I shall never forget my anxiety lest baby should commence crying again, and perhaps betray our whereabouts; I hardly dared breathe.

We managed to get some toys for Johnny from a {{merchant}} inside. (16 July)Johnny was not well to-day, and I feared he might be sickening for small-pox. (31 July)Johnny's rosy cheeks, which he never lost, excited great admiration; he passed {{most of his time}} in the square next to us with the Sikhs, who were very fond of him, and used to give him chappatties (native bread), though they could not have had much to eat themselves, poor men! (28 August) [...] Mrs. Case and Johnny were walking in the square next to ours to-day, when a Sikh officer passed them, and directly afterwards he was hit in the arm by a bullet. No place was really safe, and I never liked having the children out of my sight. (18 October) During the siege, we had picked up a little white hen, which used to run about and pick up what it could. Just before Colonel Campbell became so very ill, we had decided to kill and eat it, when one morning Johnny ran in and said, 'Oh, mamma, the white hen has laid an egg!' We took it at once to Colonel Campbell, it being a great luxury in those days. The hen laid one every day for him till he died, and then ceased for the rest of the siege; but we would not kill it then. (12 November) I had at first put the two boys into a dhoolie with their ayah, but they got separated from us, and it was fully a quarter of an hour before I found them, so I would not let them go from me again [...] [...] [...] poor baby, who was very thirsty, cried louder for it [...] than I had ever heard him before.
