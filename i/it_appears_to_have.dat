5|$|A {{standard}} analogy for compactification is {{to consider}} a multidimensional object such as a garden hose. If the hose is viewed from a sufficient distance, <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> only one dimension, its length, but as one approaches the hose, one discovers that it contains a second dimension, its circumference. Thus, an ant crawling inside it would move in two dimensions.|$|E
5|$|After Aymer's {{death in}} 1324, the castle passed by {{marriage}} to Lawrence, Lord Hastings, and {{was held in}} the Hastings family until 1390, when Reginald Lord Grey de Ruthin acquired it. There are few historical records of the castle beyond this point, but <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been abandoned in the early 14th century and by the 15th century had become ruined.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{have been}} domesticated and bred as poultry {{for use as}} food {{for at least four}} {{thousand}} years. The most important species is the chicken. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been domesticated by 5000 BC in northeastern China, likely for cockfighting, and only later used for food. In ancient Egypt, poultry including ducks, geese, and pigeons were captured in nets and then bred in captivity.|$|E

50|$|A {{successful}} early silent guitar with a full-sized {{body was}} the Gibson Chet Atkins SST. <b>It</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a soundhole, {{but it was}} in fact a dummy. It was employed by Mark Knopfler, among others.|$|R
5|$|Epiacum {{was built}} {{early in the}} 2nd century. It was at least partly {{demolished}} and rebuilt around 200; the destruction coincides with an uprising of the northern tribes in 196. The fort was modified or wholly rebuilt about the year 300. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been preceded by an Iron Age fort, followed by a Roman camp before the permanent fort was constructed.|$|E
5|$|S. g. crissalis, (vulnerable) the Lord Howe currawong was {{described}} by English naturalist Richard Bowdler Sharpe in 1877. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> adapted well to human habitation on Lord Howe Island, though the population is small overall, somewhere around 70–80 birds. Although regarded as a subspecies, {{it has yet to}} be studied with molecular DNA techniques, which may lead to it being reclassified as a separate species.|$|E
5|$|The {{causeway}} {{was originally}} a toll road, and costs for crossing ranged from one penny (1d) {{for a person}} on foot to 6d for a horse-drawn cart. The tolls were subject to an additional levy of 50 per cent during the night hours. The tolls were later removed, and <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been Perth's only toll road.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{considerable}} {{controversy over}} the 1950s method, <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been the most effective in getting the babies to [...] "sleep through the night" [...] earlier and more regularly than the {{other children in the}} study.|$|R

2500|$|In 1975 Olzhas Suleimenov {{challenged}} the mainstream {{view of the}} Tale in his book Az i Ya. [...] He claimed to reveal that Tale cannot be completely authentic since <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been rewritten in the 16th century.|$|R
5|$|The kingdom {{appears to}} have passed its peak in the 14th century, encroached upon {{by the rise of}} the Benin and Igala kingdom, and later the Atlantic slave trade, but <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{maintained}} its authority well into the 16th century, and remnants of the eze hierarchy persisted until the establishment of Colonial Nigeria in 1911 and represents one of the traditional states within modern Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|Building 28 (Structure 5D-28) is {{an unusual}} {{building}} {{at the top of}} an access stairway {{on the east side of}} the basal platform. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been a guardroom controlling access from the east terrace. The chamber originally contained curtained doorways and benches against the walls. The width of the building completely blocked access from the stairway; this forced visitors to pass through the chamber, where their presence could be scrutinised and passage beyond blocked if necessary. This route may have become important when Temple 33 was built, blocking the main access stairway from the Great Plaza. Structure 5D-28 was built very late in the Early Classic period (around the 6th century).|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} by Swiss botanist Carl Meissner in 1856, {{it was named}} in honour of English botanist Charles Morgan Lemann. It {{is one of three}} or four related species all with pendent inflorescences, which is an unusual feature within the genus. No subspecies are recognised. Banksia lemanniana is classified as Not Threatened under the Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia. Unlike many Western Australian banksias, <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> some resistance to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, {{and is one of the}} easier Western Australian species to grow in cultivation.|$|E

60|$|They {{approached}} the stump cautiously on its windward side, {{but there was}} not much <b>to</b> see. <b>It</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been split and was slightly raised, but it had certainly not been blown to fragments, as Frank had expected.|$|R
50|$|It {{was easily}} {{recognizable}} because <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a long hump over the fuselage (to accommodate two crew members {{as opposed to}} one in the Ro.57). The Ro.58 was a twin-tailed aircraft, in layout similar to the Bf 110.|$|R
5|$|Greenway {{suggested}} {{that both the}} French settlers and their slaves ate the Guadeloupe amazon, as well as destroying its habitat. The supposedly related imperial amazon survives in the steep mountain forests of Dominica, whereas Guadeloupe is less mountainous and more suitable for farming, and has a larger population of humans. Because of this, {{there would have been}} a greater pressure on the Guadeloupe amazon, and <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> become extinct by the end of the 18th century. The amazons still surviving on the West Indian islands are all endangered since they are trapped for the pet-trade, overhunted for food, and because of destruction of their habitat.|$|E
5|$|Large {{sections}} of the game feature a car which resembles a gutted-and-rebuilt 1969 Dodge Charger. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been tuned for performance. A radar system is installed later in the game, allowing the player to locate Rebel supply caches. In the final battle, a rear-mounted storage rack for Magnusson Devices is added and the radar is adjusted to track enemies and Magnusson Device dispensers. A homing unit is also installed so the player can quickly locate {{the car in the}} chaos of the final battle via a readout in the Hazardous Environment suit.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 89, the {{governor}} of Germania Superior, Lucius Antonius Saturninus, and his two legions at Mainz, Legio XIV Gemina and Legio XXI Rapax, revolted against the Roman Empire {{with the aid of}} the Germanic Chatti people. The precise cause for the rebellion is uncertain, although <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been planned well in advance. The Senatorial officers may have disapproved of Domitian's military strategies, such as his decision to fortify the German frontier rather than attack, as well as his recent retreat from Britain, and finally the disgraceful policy of appeasement towards Decebalus.|$|E
50|$|The Symantec merger helped Norton Computing {{regain the}} market share it was losing to competitors, {{especially}} Central Point Software. Norton Computing's revenues tripled between June 1990 and September 1991, and by November <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> regained the market lead over Central Point.|$|R
60|$|The {{monotonous}} roar of {{the surf}} should have lulled the boys to sleep very shortly after they {{lay down on the}} sand where a number of boulders formed a partial shelter; but instead of doing so <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the opposite effect.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} Congress, {{and before the}} civil disobedience {{campaign}} resumed, the Cabinet voted to begin roll-out of antiretroviral access through public-sector health clinics. In the South African system, the Cabinet can overrule the President, and <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> done so in this case.|$|R
5|$|Technetium plays {{no natural}} {{biological}} role {{and is not}} normally found in the human body. Technetium is produced in quantity by nuclear fission, and spreads more readily than many radionuclides. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> low chemical toxicity. For example, no significant change in blood formula, body and organ weights, and food consumption could be detected for rats which ingested up to 15µg of technetium-99 per gram of food for several weeks. The radiological toxicity of technetium (per unit of mass) {{is a function of}} compound, type of radiation for the isotope in question, and the isotope's half-life.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} {{is one of the}} New World warblers or wood-warblers in {{the family}} Parulidae. This species was {{originally}} placed under the genus Dendroica. It was recently adjusted {{to be a member of}} genus Setophaga along with all other members of the genus Dendroica, based on the findings from a recent phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA in 2010. The old genus Dendroica was then deleted. Within the genus, <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> no particularly close relatives.|$|E
5|$|While the Force 2020 {{plan has}} proven controversial, <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{been adopted by}} the East Timorese government. The plan was criticised by the United Nations and the governments of Australia and the United States as {{unaffordable}} and in excess of East Timor's needs. East Timorese President José Ramos-Horta defended the plan, however, arguing that its adoption will transform the F-FDTL into a professional force capable of defending East Timor's sovereignty and contributing to the nation's stability. East Timorese defence officials have also stressed that Force 2020 is a long-term plan and does not propose acquiring advanced weapons for some years.|$|E

60|$|Although {{he asked}} this {{question}} of Martin, {{he did not look}} towards him, but kept his eyes on Mr Pecksniff as before. <b>It</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> become a habit with him, both in a literal and figurative sense, to look to Mr Pecksniff alone.|$|R
50|$|The {{pastoral}} {{letter was}} read {{over the radio}} by chaplain of Nachtigall Battalion Father Hryn’okh the same morning. <b>It</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> removed any doubts {{which may have been}} lingering in the mind of most prominent Ukrainians in Lviv concerning the origin of the Stets’ko government.|$|R
5|$|Writing around 1200, Niketas Choniates equated {{the office}} with the Western marshal, and <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been used interchangeably with the latter title in the Latin Empire and the other Latin states formed after the Fourth Crusade. The office {{continued}} to exist during the Palaiologan period until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. It remained {{one of the highest}} dignities of state, ranking eighth overall in the hierarchy, although from the late 13th century on, multiple persons could hold it.|$|E
5|$|Zeta Tucanae is a yellow-white main {{sequence}} star of spectral type F9.5V and an apparent magnitude of 4.20 located 28 light-years {{away from the}} Solar System. Despite having a slightly lower mass, this star is more luminous than the Sun. The composition and mass of this star {{are very similar to}} the Sun, with a slightly lower mass and an estimated age of three billion years. The solar-like qualities make it a target of interest for investigating the possible existence of a life-bearing planet. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a debris disk orbiting it at a minimum radius of 2.3 astronomical units. As of 2009, no planet has been discovered in orbit around this star.|$|E
5|$|Since a {{proposal}} by Butinov and Knorozov in the 1950s, {{the majority of}} philologists, linguists and cultural historians have taken the line that rongorongo was not true writing but proto-writing, that is, an ideographic- and rebus-based mnemonic device, such as the Dongba script of the Nakhi people, which would in all likelihood {{make it impossible to}} decipher. This skepticism is justified not only by the failure of the numerous attempts at decipherment, but by the extreme rarity of independent writing systems around the world. Of those who have attempted to decipher rongorongo as a true writing system, the vast majority have assumed it was logographic, a few that it was syllabic or mixed. Statistically <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been compatible with neither a pure logography nor a pure syllabary. The topic of the texts is unknown; various investigators have speculated they cover genealogy, navigation, astronomy, or agriculture. Oral history suggests that only a small elite were ever literate, and that the tablets were considered sacred.|$|E
5000|$|At 7:30am {{the next}} day, a local man {{walking along the}} road between Stradbally and Kilmacthomas came across a postman’s bicycle lying on the road three feet from the edge, {{pointing}} toward Kilmacthomas. <b>It</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been carefully laid down.
