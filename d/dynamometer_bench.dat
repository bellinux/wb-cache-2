40|$|Abstract: In this paper, some vehicle models {{used for}} <b>dynamometer</b> test <b>bench</b> are put forward to adapt {{different}} performance tests of two-axle vehicle. Firstly, the vehicle driving model with two {{degrees of freedom}} is established by analyzing the force condition of a moving vehicle. And it can be used in performance tests which do not need complex road condition, such as acceleration test. Secondly, considering pitching motion of vehicle, the driving model with three degrees of freedom is proposed and applied to performance tests which need complex road condition, like thermal balance test or road simulation experiment. Finally, in order to do steering performance test in <b>dynamometer</b> test <b>bench,</b> the driving model is modified by considering the influence caused by steering and combines steering model to become a whole steering model of vehicle.

Each participant lay on an isokinetic dynamometer (CON-TREX, CMV AG, Switzerland) with the right knee and hip joints fully extended. The right foot was tightly secured to the dynamometer’s footplate, and the right thigh was fixed to the <b>dynamometer’s</b> <b>bench</b> with a non-elastic strap to minimize unwanted movements. The center of rotation of the footplate and center of the ankle joint were aligned visually. During the twitch and conditioning contractions, the ankle joint angle was set at 0 ° (anatomical position). The joint angular velocity of the maximal voluntary concentric contraction was set at 30 °/s and 180 °/s (slow and fast conditions, respectively). The range of motion of the maximal voluntary concentric contraction was set from - 15 ° (dorsiflexion) to 30 ° (plantar flexion) in the fast velocity condition and from - 15 ° to - 5 ° in the slow velocity condition to minimize the difference of the contraction duration between the two velocity conditions. In a preliminary study, we confirmed that peak torque during the maximal voluntary concentric contraction in each velocity condition was recorded within these ranges of motion. Subjects were instructed to perform the fast and slow maximal voluntary concentric contraction as forcibly as possible.|$|R

40|$|The paper compares two {{different}} design concepts {{for a range}} extender engine rated at 30 kW at 4500 rpm. The first project is a conventional 4 -Stroke SI engine, 2 -cylinder, 2 -valve, equipped with port fuel injection. The second is {{a new type of}} 2 -Stroke loop scavenged SI engine, featuring a direct gasoline injection and a patented rotary valve for enhancing the induction and scavenging processes. Both power units have been virtually designed with the help of CFD simulation. Moreover, for the 2 -Stroke engine, a prototype has been also built and tested at the <b>dynamometer</b> <b>bench,</b> allowing the authors to make a reliable theoretical comparison with the well assessed 4 -Stroke unit.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the reproducibility of findings derived from a new iso-inertial <b>dynamometer</b> during <b>bench</b> press (BP) and squat (SQ) and to provide descriptive data for recreational athletes. A position transducer and accelerometer were combined to assess velocity and power during free weight lifting exercises. Simulated movement with a pulley system revealed the excellent technical consistency of the dynamometer. Sixteen male subjects participated in the study. Iso-inertial tests consisted of lifting as fast as possible four different relative loads (35, 50, 70, 90 % 1 RM in BP and 45, 60, 75, 90 % 1 RM in SQ). The test was repeated one week later. Analysis of variance revealed no significant variation between sessions or trials. Reproducibility was better in velocity than in power, although it remained fairly good in both exercises (coefficients of variation [CV] never exceeding 10 %) except for the time to peak power parameter. Descriptive data confirmed the classical force-velocity and force-power relationships for BP and SQ. In conclusion, this study demonstrated reliable measurements in BP and SQ iso-inertial exercises. Monitoring force-velocity and force-power relationships offers an original functional approach in strength training supervision. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{prognostic}} {{method is}} presented for fault detection in gears and bearings in wind turbine drivetrains. This method {{is based on}} angular velocity measurements from the gearbox input shaft and the output to the generator, using two additional angular velocity sensors on the intermediate shafts inside the gearbox. An angular velocity error function is defined and compared in the faulty and fault-free conditions in frequency domain. Faults can be detected from {{the change in the}} energy level of the frequency spectrum of an error function. The method is demonstrated by detecting bearing faults in three locations: the high-speed shaft stage, the planetary stage and the intermediate-speed shaft stage. Simulations of the faulty and fault-free cases are performed on a gearbox model implemented in multibody dynamic simulation software. The global loads on the gearbox are obtained from a <b>dynamometer</b> test <b>bench</b> and applied to the numerical gearbox model. The method is exemplified using a 750 kW wind turbine gearbox.

Exhaust from Euro 5 Diesel vehicles equipped with additive and catalysed particle filter and Euro 5 gasoline vehicle with direct injection system has been taken directly from the tailpipe and diluted by Constant Volume Sampler (CVS). Tested gasoline DI vehicle emits 25 % more CO 2 than Diesel vehicles for all Artemis and NEDC driving conditions. It emits 2 to 200 times more PN and BC and 5 to 150 times less NOx than Diesel vehicles. Additive DPF vehicles emit 2 times more NO 2 for urban conditions (175 mg/km), comparing to Diesel catalysed DPF (80 mg/km). No significant differences have been observed between additive and catalysed DPF for CO 2 and NOx emissions. The cold start induces 10 to 20 % more CO 2 emissions for all tested vehicles. It induces 3 to 20 times higher PN emission with a great uncertainty. For NOx and NO 2, the cold start induces about 40 to 60 % less emissions for additive DPF Diesel vehicles.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} CO 2 and {{regulated}} pollutants (NOx, HC, CO, PM) emitted by eight Euro 4 - 6 gasoline and diesel vehicles with six different technologies. The emission factors were repeatedly {{measured on a}} chassis <b>dynamometer</b> <b>bench</b> using Artemis Urban with cold and hot start, Road and Motorway, WLTC and NEDC driving conditions. The influence of driving conditions and approved driving cycles on pollutant emissions was also investigated. The measured emission factors for regulated compounds were compared to the corresponding emission factors of the COPCETE emission model developed by the French Ministry of Ecology. The {{results indicate that the}} NEDC cycle, used for type-approval of emissions of regulated compounds, leads to underestimation of CO 2 (9 - 23 %) and NOx (1. 2 to 2 times) emissions and overestimation of CO and HC (2 to 5 times) in relation to the Artemis cycles, which are real-world simulation driving cycles. The WLTC cycle for the worldwide harmonization of vehicle emissions shows similar HC, NOx and CO emissions with the Artemis average cycle within uncertainty of the measurements. The NOx emissions measured were 1. 6 to 8 times greater than the type-approval limits. These high NOx emissions produced by all the diesel vehicles tested under real-world driving conditions could serve as particle precursors and increase secondary organic aerosol formation. They are also indicative of the significant cause for concern regarding urban air quality and the increase in the portion of Euro 5 and 6 diesel vehicles in France's vehicle fleet. Regarding emission factor assessments, the emission levels measured are overall in fair agreement with the COPCETE predictions within uncertainties for CO 2 and regulated pollutants.

40|$|The {{increase}} in the number of motorcycles in large Brazilian cities is due to several factors such as traffic, low cost, mobility, few parking lots and the low efficiency of public transportation, becoming an important factor in air quality deterioration. In this context, vehicle emissions monitoring is essential to understand the contribution to air pollution as a whole. In this scenario, the emissions were sampled on a motorcycle <b>dynamometer</b> test <b>bench</b> and analyzed by gas chromatography and on-line analyzers according to the EC/ 97 / 24 standard (European Commission). Emissions from motorcycles using commercial gasoline (with 22 % of ethanol) were used in combination with meteorological data and ambient air pollutants for Rio de Janeiro City (Brazil) during the Winter of 2011, using the trajectory model OZIPR (Ozone Isopleth Package for Research) and the chemical model SAPRC 99 (State-wide Air Pollution Research Centre) to assess the impact on the ozone formation in the troposphere of Rio de Janeiro for the next several years. The results indicate that ozone levels will exceed the established limits by national legislation within three years. The study also showed that pollutant emission rates stay in agreement with emissions recommended by the Brazilian legislation for all phases. The {{increase in}} ozone concentration occurs due to high emissions of reactive volatile organic compounds in an atmosphere with high levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx).

40|$|AbstractThe {{homologation}} {{cycle of}} vehicles for private passenger transportation or for light duty applications considers a cold start from ambient temperature. The most part of harmful substances (≈ 60 - 65 %) are produced during the thermal engine stabilization which {{occurs in the}} very of the driving cycle. This strongly influences also engine efficiency, i. e. fuel consumption. The more recent commitments on CO 2, therefore, reinforce the concept of reducing warm up time encountering it in the low carbon engine technologies. Due to this importance, engine thermal management {{has been the subject}} of a huge interest opening the way to new components, technologies and control strategies. This regards not only the coolant fluid, which undoubtedly influences engine warm up, but also the lubricant:an its heating acceleration produces much faster benefits [...] The purpose of this paper is to assess the effect of a faster oil heating during the homologation cycle on the fuel consumption. An experimental campaign has been done on an 3 L Iveco F 1 C engine mounted on a <b>dynamometer</b> test <b>bench</b> operated in order to reproduce the NEDC. The engine OEM has been characterized and the effect of the oil temperature has been studied according to: (a) an external heat source which brings the oil at its stabilized temperature value before engine start, (b) an internal heat source represented by the exhaust gases which almost immediately reach a temperature value able to heat-up the oil.

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{evaluating}} the effects of gasoline-ethanol blends on the exhaust emissions in a catalyst-equipped four-stroke moped engine. The ethanol was blended with unleaded gasoline in at percentages (10, 15, and 20 % v/v). The regulated pollutants and the particulate matter emissions were evaluated over the European ECE R 47 driving cycle on the chassis <b>dynamometer</b> <b>bench.</b> Particulate matter was characterized in terms of total mass collected on filters and total number of particles in the range 7 nm- 10 μm measured by electrical low-pressure impactor (ELPI). In addition, particle-phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) emissions were evaluated to assess the health impact of the emitted particulate. Finally, an accurate morphological analysis {{was performed on the}} particulate by high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) equipped with a digital image-processing/data-acquisition system. In general, CO emission reductions of 60 - 70 % were obtained with 15 and 20 % v/v ethanol blends, while the ethanol use did not reduce hydrocarbon (HC) and NO x emissions. No evident effect of ethanol on the particulate mass emissions and associated PAHs emissions was observed. Twenty-one PAHs were quantified in the particulate phase with emissions ranging from 26 to 35 μg/km and benzo[a]pyrene equivalent (BaPeq) emission factors from 2. 2 to 4. 1 μg/km. Both particulate matter and associated PAHs with higher carcinogenic risk were mainly emitted in the submicrometer size range (< 0. 1 μm). On the basis of the TEM observations, no relevant effect of the ethanol use on the particulate morphology was evidenced, showing aggregates composed of primary particles with mean diameters in the range 17. 5 - 32. 5 nm. Implications: Mopeds may contribute in a large share to air pollution in some major urban areas; therefore, efforts may be taken to reduce their emissions. The addition of ethanol into gasoline (up 20 % v/v) leads to a significant reduction of CO emission at the exhaust of a catalyzed 4 -S moped, whereas this does not reduce HC and NOx. No clear effects on particulate matter and associated PAHs emissions have been observed with ethanol addition, but particulate-phase PAHs were mainly found on submicrometer-size particles (< 0. 1 μm), which penetrate deeply into the human respiratory tract...|$|E
