With the increase in popularity of this machining concept, the need for detailed study of a valid chip formation in circular <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> is becoming necessary for accurate kinematic and dynamic modeling of the cutting process.

At first, the difference in the feed per tooth formulation for <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> along linear and circular tool-path trajectories is presented. In the next step, valid formulation of the undeformed chip thickness in circular <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> is derived by considering an epitrochoidal tooth trajectory {{with a wide range of}} the tool-path radius. The complex transcendental equations encountered in the derivation are dealt with, by a case-based approach to obtain closed-form analytical solutions.

The geometry of an <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> tool is complex. To overcome {{the complexity of the}} analysis, a simple beam model is considered. In this work the modeling of structure of an <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> is carried out and by the application of Finite Element Methods. The Static analysis has been performed {{in order to determine the}} deflection and suppress the vibration of <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> cutter so that the work piece will not have waviness on the surface, leading to minimization of chatter encountered during machining. The effect of dynamic response of the <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> tool is studied with and without the application of MR damper. Metal cutting operation involves interaction of cutting forces of the tool with the regenerative forces of the material of work piece during metal cutting. To control the <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> tool vibration and suppress the chatter, the method incorporates the unique features of a magnetic-rheological fluid, utilizes the damper input current to modify the magnetic field inside the coil of the damper and increase the variable stiffness and produce damping effect. In this work, the identification of chatter is done by means of the Bingham number of the magnetic-rheological fluid. The different metal cutting parameters are considered in experimental work and results are compared with and without the application of magnetic-rheological damping effect. The results show the enhancement of quality of the machined surface, reduction of deflection of the <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> tool and decrease in the chatter marks on work piece by producing magnetic-rheological damping to the <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> tool.
