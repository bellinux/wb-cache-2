25|$|Indian Rock in Montebello, New York {{is a large}} glacial erratic boulder {{of granite}} gneiss, formed in the Proterozoic (Precambrian) era, 1.2 billion to 800 million years ago. It is {{estimated}} to weigh ≈17,300 tons. The source area for the boulder was nearby in the Ramapo Mountains-Hudson Highlands. The boulder rests upon glacial outwash which in turn lies atop Triassic sedimentary red beds (sandstone and shale) of the Newark Basin (circa 145 million years old). The rock was carried to its current location by the <b>internal</b> <b>flow</b> of the continental ice sheet during the last glacial maximum, circa 21,000 years ago. The base of the continental glacier scoured the bedrock terrain across which it moved, thus plucking large and small blocks of rock from {{their position in the}} Ramapo Mountains and Hudson Highlands. Indian Rock got as far as Rockland County before being liberated by the ice and deposited along with gravels shifted by glacial meltwater.|$|E

At the least flow rate, the frequency of 2452Hz compared favorably to n=3. At intermediate flow rates, several non-harmonically related frequencies occurred simultaneously suggesting that several corrugations were involved in the sound generation. In the smaller metal tube, a predominant tone appeared at 6174Hz and corresponded to n=2. A unique aspect of this whistle is that the <b>internal</b> <b>flow</b> carries both the unstable vortex downstream and the returning feedback signal upstream.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the amount}} of strain (deformation) is {{proportional}} to the stress being applied, ice will act as an elastic solid. Ice will not flow until it has reached a thickness of 30 meters (98ft), but after 50 meters (164ft), small amounts of stress can result in a large amount of strain, causing the deformation to become a plastic flow rather than elastic. At this point the glacier will begin to deform under its own weight and flow across the landscape. According to the Glen–Nye Flow law, the relationship between stress and strain, and thus the rate of <b>internal</b> <b>flow,</b> can be modeled as follows: ...|$|E

50|$|Internal and {{external}} flow can also classify convection. <b>Internal</b> <b>flow</b> {{occurs when a}} fluid is enclosed by a solid boundary such when flowing through a pipe. An external flow occurs when a fluid extends indefinitely without encountering a solid surface. Both {{of these types of}} convection, either natural or forced, can be internal or external because they are independent of each other. The bulk temperature, or the average fluid temperature, is a convenient reference point for evaluating properties related to convective heat transfer, particularly in applications related to flow in pipes and ducts.|$|E

40|$|Fluctuations in <b>internal</b> {{migration}} <b>flows</b> {{have been}} {{closely associated with}} changes in economic processes. However, foreign immigrants’ spatial responses to changing national economic conditions {{have not yet been}} sufficiently studied. This paper aims to analyse the impact of the Spanish economic downturn on Latin American immigrants’ mobility by examining their territorial patterns of internal migration. In order to elucidate the intensity and directionality of Latin Americans’ <b>internal</b> <b>flows</b> between 2004 and 2013, divided in two periods – before and during the crisis–, we relied on the data of the Residential Variation Statistics, {{and the creation of a}} typology of provinces according to each province’s socio-economic characteristics.

This study shows that Latin Americans’ <b>internal</b> <b>flows</b> in Spain have been affected by the economic downturn, revealing a decrease in intensity and a change in directionality. The economic crisis in Spain has caused a change in the previous dynamic of geographical dispersion and has become a new factor of differentiation in the distribution of the Latin American population in Spain...|$|R
