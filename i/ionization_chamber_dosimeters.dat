According to previous studies, wedge correction factors of <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber</b> <b>dosimeters</b> in different wedge directions at various off-axis distances were different from those at central beam axis [9, 10], while in other studies performed by entrance surface diode dosimeters, no differences between them were considered [3, 5, 11, 12]. Thus, {{it is necessary to}} investigate the manner of diode reading variations at different directions of externally wedged fields. In clinical situations, sometimes, it is necessary to determine the delivered dose to the organ at risk placed out of the central beam axis for wedged photon beams. Thus, applying a proper wedge correction factor at depth is obligatory for the estimation of organ-at-risk dose value.|$|E

The public {{security}} industry standard “General technical requirements for micro-dose X-ray transmission body scanner ” (GA 926 - 2011) {{was released in}} March 25, 2011 and was formally implemented in July 1, 2011. The X-ray radiation performance index of micro-dose X-ray transmission body scanner includes Dose Per Inspection and Leakage Radiation Rate. The standard requires that Dose Per Inspection should be tested by ionization dosimeter. However, it doesn't specify which kind of equipment {{should be used to}} test Leakage Radiation Rate, and only requires a high sensitivity dosimeter. Therefore it is necessary to synthetically consider numerical features and test accuracy requirements, select appropriate test methods and test equipments.

40|$|The {{principle}} of radiobiology and, hence, clinical outcomes in radiotherapy are inherently dependent on accurate radiation dosimetry. Over {{the last few}} decades, <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers,</b> thermoluminescence <b>dosimeters</b> (TLDs), film dosimeters, and semiconducting dosimeters have been commonly used in radiotherapy. However, the shortcomings of each type of dosimeter limit their applications for in vivo radiation measurements for provision of accurate and precise dosimetric information in real-time. The objective of this thesis is to explore {{a new generation of}} radiation dosimeters by using state-of-the-art nanomaterials and technologies to realize real-time monitoring of dose delivery in radiotherapy. This thesis investigates the use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and carbon fibres as sensing materials for dosimetric measurements. First, a parallel plate <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber</b> with CNT electrodes was designed to study the ionization collection efficiency of the CNTs. The prototype chamber had two stainless steel electrodes, which were customized to accommodate the CNT samples. Experiments, such as saturation characteristics, linearity, and electrode separation, were performed to characterize the prototype <b>chamber.</b> Secondly, <b>dosimeters</b> based on the resistance change of CNTs and carbon fibres were studied. The proposed dosimeters, based on carbon fibre sheets and CNT films, were designed and fabricated. Dose rate, dose, and field size measurements were carried out to evaluate these novel dosimeters that were able to provide dose rate and dose information at the same time. Thirdly, a transparent and flexible CNT-based film dosimeter was investigated. The flexible dosimeter can perform dosimetric measurements when it was bent to fit the curvature of the measured surface. Finally, a dosimeter array system, consisting of a CNT-based film dosimeter array, a readout circuit, and user interface software, was designed and implemented. The array with the parallel electrode structure and a 3 × 3 mm^ 2 sensing area for each pixel provided good signal responses. The array system displayed excellent repeatability in the measurements. 1 yea...|$|R

40|$|Before microCT can be {{exploited}} {{to its full}} potential for longitudinal monitoring of transgenic and experimental mouse models of lung diseases, radiotoxic side-effects such as inflammation or fibrosis must be considered. We evaluated dose and potential radiotoxicity to the lungs for long-term respiratory gated high-resolution microCT protocols. Free-breathing C 57 Bl/ 6 -mice underwent four different retrospectively respiratory gated microCT imaging schedules of repeated scans during five or twelve weeks, followed by ex vivo microCT and detailed histological and biochemical assessment of lung damage. Radiation exposure, dose and absorbed dose were determined by <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber,</b> thermoluminescent <b>dosimeter</b> measurements and Monte Carlo calculations. Despite the relatively large radiation dose delivered per microCT acquisition, mice did not show any signs of radiation-induced lung damage or fibrosis when scanned weekly during 5 and up to 12 weeks. Doubling the scanning frequency and once tripling the radiation dose, e. g. mimicking the instant repetition of a failed scan, also stayed without detectable toxicity after 5 weeks of scanning. Histological analyses confirmed the absence of radiotoxic damage to the lungs, demonstrating that long-term monitoring of mouse lungs using high-resolution microCT is safe. This opens perspectives for longitudinal monitoring of (transgenic) mouse models of lung diseases and therapeutic response {{on an individual basis}} with high spatial and temporal resolution, without concerns for radiation toxicity that could potentially influence the readout of microCT-derived lung biomarkers. This work further supports the introduction of microCT for routine use in the preclinical pulmonary research field where post mortem histological approaches are still the gold standard. status: publishe...|$|R

Three dose calculation algorithms implemented in the CMS FOCUS treatment planning system have been assessed and validated using <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers,</b> thermoluminescent <b>dosimeters</b> (TLDs) and film. The algorithms include the multigrid superposition (MGS) algorithm, fast Fourier Transform Convolution (FFTC) algorithm and Clarkson algorithm. Heterogeneous phantoms {{used in the study}} consist of air cavities, lung analogue and an anthropomorphic phantom. Depth dose distributions along the central beam axis for 6 MV and 10 MV photon beams with field sizes of 5 cm x 5 cm and 10 cm x 10 cm were measured in the air cavity phantoms and lung analogue phantom. Point dose measurements were performed in the anthropomorphic phantom. Calculated results with three dose calculation algorithms were compared with measured results. In the air cavity phantoms, the maximum dose differences between the algorithms and the measurements were found at the distal surface of the air cavity with a 10 MV photon beam and a 5 cm x 5 cm field size. The differences were 3. 8 %, 24. 9 % and 27. 7 % for the MGS, FFTC and Clarkson algorithms, respectively. Experimental measurements of secondary electron build-up range beyond the air cavity showed an increase with decreasing field size, increasing energy and increasing air cavity thickness. The maximum dose differences in the lung analogue with 5 cm x 5 cm field size were found to be 0. 3 %, 4. 9 % and 6. 9 % for the MGS, FFTC and Clarkson algorithms with a 6 MV photon beam and 0. 4 %, 6. 3 % and 9. 1 % with a 10 MV photon beam, respectively. In the anthropomorphic phantom, the dose differences between calculations using the MGS algorithm and measurements with TLD rods were less than 4. 5 % for 6 MV and 10 MV photon beams with 10 cm x 10 cm field size and 6 MV photon beam with 5 cm x 5 cm field size, and within 7. 5 % for 10 MV with 5 cm x 5 cm field size, respectively. The FFTC and Clarkson algorithms overestimate doses at all dose points in the lung of the anthropomorphic phantom. In conclusion, the MGS is the most accurate dose calculation algorithm of investigated photon beam models.
