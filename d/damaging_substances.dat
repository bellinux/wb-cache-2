The VLS process may risk introducing catalyst residual atoms into the ZnO nanorods, which is incompatible with silicon technology and additionally requires heat treatment at high temperatures, which can <b>damage</b> <b>substances</b> already present on the substrates. As a result, the patterned growth of aligned ZnO nanorods has been conducted on expensive substrates, including GaN, SiC, and sapphire [2]. Thus mass production of high-quality-patterned ZnO nanorods at low cost is still a challenge.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to peripheral mechanisms, spinal mechanisms {{are thought to}} have an influencing role in phantom pains. Peripheral nerve injury can lead to the degeneration of C fibers in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and terminating A fibers may subsequently branch into the same lamina. If this occurs, A fiber inputs could be reported as noxious stimuli. Substance P, involved in the transmission of pain signals, is usually expressed by Aδ and C fibers, but following peripheral nerve <b>damage,</b> <b>substance</b> P is expressed by Aβ fibers. This leads to hyperexcitability of the spinal cord, which usually occurs only in the presence of noxious stimuli. Because patients with complete spinal cord injury have experienced phantom pains, there must be an underlying central mechanism responsible for the generation of phantom pains.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{biological}} {{effects of}} resin-modified glass-ionomer cements {{as used in}} clinical dentistry are described, and the literature reviewed on this topic. METHODS: Information on resin-modified glass-ionomers and on 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), the most <b>damaging</b> <b>substance</b> released by these materials, has been collected from over 50 published papers. These were mainly identified through Scopus. RESULTS: HEMA {{is known to be}} released from these materials and has a variety of damaging biological properties, ranging from pulpal inflammation to allergic contact dermatitis. These are therefore potential hazards from resin-modified glass-ionomers. However, clinical results with these materials that have been reported to date are generally positive. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Resin-modified glass-ionomers cannot be considered biocompatible to nearly the same extent as conventional glass-ionomers. Care needs to be taken with regard to their use in dentistry and, in particular, dental personnel may be at risk from adverse effects such as contact dermatitis and other immunological responses...|$|R

50|$|In animal studies, Danshen has {{appeared}} {{to interfere with}} the development of liver fibrosis — the formation of scar-like fibers in the liver. Because the nonfunctioning fibers crowd out active liver tissue, liver function decreases gradually as the amount of fibrous tissue increases. Having chronic hepatitis and habitually drinking large amounts of alcoholic beverages are the major causes of liver fibrosis, which could also result from exposure to chemicals or certain drugs. Danshen may also increase blood flow into the liver, so the length of time that potentially <b>damaging</b> <b>substances</b> stay in the liver may be reduced, also reducing the possible injury they may cause. Results from a few animal studies showed it may also protect kidney tissues from damage caused by diabetes.

50|$|The human {{aortic valve}} {{normally}} {{consists of three}} cusps or leaflets and has an opening of 3.0-4.0 square centimeters. When the left ventricle contracts, it forces blood through the valve into the aorta and subsequently {{to the rest of}} the body. When the left ventricle expands again, the aortic valve closes and prevents the blood in the aorta from flowing backward (regurgitation) into the left ventricle. In aortic stenosis, the opening of the aortic valve becomes narrowed or constricted (stenotic) (i.e., due to calcification). Degenerative aortic stenosis, the most common variety, and bicuspid aortic stenosis both begin with damage to endothelial cells from increased mechanical stress. Inflammation is thought to be involved in the earlier stages of the pathogenesis of AS and its associated risk factors are known to promote the deposition of LDL cholesterol and a highly <b>damaging</b> <b>substance</b> known as Lipoprotein(a) into the aortic valve resulting in significant damage and stenosis over time.|$|R

The provincial government has the responsibility of controlling the use of the substances, while the federal government is in control of the manufacturing, importing, and exporting of the substances.

40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} to quantify toxic combination effects of environmental chemicals. The assumption that a membrane <b>damaging</b> <b>substance</b> A enhances the cytotoxic effects of a substance B was confirmed by our experiments with human fibroblasts.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the {{convention}} of allocating donated gametes on a “first come, first served” basis should be replaced with an allocation sys-tem {{that takes into account}} more morally relevant criteria than waiting time. This conclusion was developed using an empirical bioethics method-ology, which involved a study of the views of eighteen staff members from seven UK fertility clinics, and twenty academics, policy-makers, representa-tives of patient groups, and other relevant professionals, on the allocation of donated sperm and eggs. Against these views, we consider some nu-anced ways of including criteria in a points allocation system. We argue that such a system is more ethically robust than “first come, first served”, but we acknowledge that our results suggest that a points system will meet with resistance from those working in the field. We conclude that criteria such as a patient’s age, potentially <b>damaging</b> <b>substance</b> use, and parental status should be used to allocate points and determine which patients re-ceive treatment and in what order. These and other factors should be ap-plied according to how they bear on considerations like child welfare, pa-tient welfare, and the effectiveness of the proposed treatment...|$|R

30|$|Concrete {{structures}} are crack-prone. This {{is particularly true}} for slabs on grade. Attempts at crack control are directed at reducing the width of each particular crack, {{in spite of the}} tradeoff of increasing the number of cracks. The durability of concrete is impaired by cracks, as they provide a path for the transportation of potentially harmful liquids and gases. Cracks of small width reduce the deterioration risk due to diminished influx of potentially <b>damaging</b> <b>substances</b> (Concrete Construction Staff 1997; The Concrete Society 2013). Narrow cracks are also preferable for aesthetic reasons. Furthermore, the mechanisms of concrete self-healing will only mend cracks of small breadth (Van Tittelboom et al. 2013). It is generally acknowledged that fibers do limit the widths of cracks caused by plastic and drying shrinkage. The higher the amount of fibers, the more effective is the crack limitation. Accordingly, to achieve uniform crack control throughout the concrete pour, the fibers should be evenly distributed. Also, irregular fiber distribution may give varying workability, e.g. pumping suitability, and affect separation tendencies.|$|E
