25|$|<b>In</b> 1993, <b>Forrest</b> <b>Sawyer,</b> {{host of the}} ABC News/Entertainment program Day One, alleged {{financial}} improprieties by the Warwick Foundation, {{founded in}} 1989 to benefit AIDS patients, and particularly Warwick's charity concert performances organized to benefit the organization.

Sawyer, Don Smith, and photographer George Gentry were cited for a documentary in which viewers were [...] "treated to a quality of visual beauty not often seen on television and, at the same time, were informed, enlightened, and challenged concerning the problems of retaining a great natural heritage and a diminishing resource—the unspoiled beauty of the Atlantic Coast." ...|$|R

5000|$|With {{a writing}} team in place, Sand would map {{out a plan}} for The Wilton North Report that {{included}} two hosts and segments based on real, as opposed to fictitious, people and situations. The show's centerpiece segment would be its leadoff feature, a daily review of the day's news events (using actual news footage) in a comical and light-hearted yet still hard-hitting tone. Sand called Wilton North [...] "Siskel & Ebert meet The Today Show," [...] and {{wanted it to be}} not only unique but [...] "controversial, opinionated, provocative," [...] not minding if the material would offend people. [...] Sand would also set about searching for hosts for the show, considering not only entertainers but actual journalists for the role; after considering or auditioning various names including comedian Ellen DeGeneres, MTV personality Nina Blackwood, and newscaster <b>Forrest</b> <b>Sawyer,</b> Sand settled on Phil Cowan and Paul Robins, a Sacramento morning drive-time disc jockey team who came in with a limited amount of television experience; Cowan and Robins were hired a mere 10 days before Wilton Norths scheduled debut on November 30, 1987.|$|R
