50|$|With {{the devastating}} {{effects of the}} early 2010 {{earthquake}} in Haiti there came renewed calls for a further debt cancellation from civil society groups. In light of the tragedy and new borrowing that lifted Haiti's debts back to $1.25 billion, {{groups such as the}} Jubilee Debt Campaign called for this debt to be dropped. Furthermore, during the aftermath emergency money was offered to the Haitian government from the IMF in the form of loans. Civil society groups protested the offer of loans and not grants for such an already <b>heavily</b> <b>indebted</b> <b>country</b> trying to cope with such destruction. Some have argued, however, that because Haiti's annual debt service payments are so low ($9 million a year, net of the debt service paid on Haiti's behalf by the U.S. government), canceling the debt would do little to help the country recover from the earthquake, and should not be a priority for activism.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to predict the}} incidence of arrears to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) by modifying and applying two of the major early warning systems for currency crises: the "signals" approach proposed by Kaminsky, Lizondo, and Reinhart (1997) and the probit-based alternative developed by Berg and Pattillo (1998). The results, based on both in-sample and out-of-sample tests, appear encouraging.

40|$|The author devised an {{analytical}} framework {{to examine the}} implications of debt-reduction operations for the economy of a typical middle-income, <b>heavily</b> <b>indebted</b> <b>country.</b> A major finding is that debt-reduction policies can succeed in restoring investment and, consequently, growth in debtor countries. Such policies combine a liquidity effect resulting from the reduction in debt service payments and an incentive effect resulting from debt relief. A simulation designed to analyze the effects of debt-reduction policies in Argentina showed that a 30 percent reduction in debt had a 2. 4 percent {{positive effect on the}} level of GDP in the first year and a 5. 4 percent effect in the fifth year. The model identifies various channels through which a reduction in foreign debt influences investment. The analysis includes a calculation of the debt-reduction and liquidity combination that maximizes Argentina's GDP. The purpose was to determine the best use of a potential loan to the country from international financial institutions. The empirical results suggest the tentative conclusion that a Brady Initiative debt and debt service reduction operation could establish the basis for sustainable growth in Argentina, if combined with appropriate domestic policies.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} a multilateral debt relief program on child health. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank launched the <b>Heavily</b> <b>Indebted</b> Poor <b>Countries</b> Initiative in the late 1990 s to reduce the debt burdens of poor countries, and explicitly linked the initiative to the aim of poverty reduction and social targets. As a result, debt-servicing costs have gone down by an average 1. 8 percentage points of gross domestic product in <b>Heavily</b> <b>Indebted</b> Poor <b>Countries.</b> However, the social effects of debt relief are not well known. The paper employs micro data on infant mortality from 56 country-specific Demographic and Health Surveys to investigate the effects of the <b>Heavily</b> <b>Indebted</b> Poor <b>Countries</b> Initiative on child health. The retrospective fertility structure of the data allows for analysis using the within-mother variation in the probability of survival of babies before and after different stages of the initiative. The results suggest that after a debt-ridden country enters the program, which is conditional on reform and pro-development policies, and receives interim debt relief, the probability of infant mortality goes down by about 0. 5 percentage point. This translates into about 3, 000 fewer infant deaths in an average <b>Heavily</b> <b>Indebted</b> Poor <b>Country.</b> The findings are particularly strong for infants born to poor mothers and mothers living in rural areas, and are driven by access to vaccines early in life and during pregnancy.

40|$|The <b>Heavily</b> <b>Indebted</b> Poor <b>Countries</b> (HIPC) Initiative, {{which was}} {{launched}} in 1996, is the first comprehensive effort {{by the international community}} to reduce the external debt of the world's poorest countries. The Initiative will generate substantial savings relative to current and past public spending on health and education in these countries. Although there is ample scope for raising public health spending in <b>heavily</b> <b>indebted</b> poor <b>countries,</b> it may not be advisable to spend all the savings resulting from HIPC resources for this purpose. Any comprehensive strategy for tackling poverty should also focus on improving the efficiency of public health outlays and on reallocating funds to programmes that are most beneficial to the poor. In order to ensure that debt relief increases poverty-reducing spending and benefits the poor, all such spending, not just that financed by HIPC resources, should be tracked. This requires that countries improve all aspects of their public expenditure management. In the short run, <b>heavily</b> <b>indebted</b> poor <b>countries</b> can take some pragmatic tracking measures based on existing public expenditure management systems, but in the longer run they should adopt a more comprehensive approach so as to strengthen their budget formulation, execution, and reporting systems...|$|R
40|$|For {{combined}} {{threat and}} tenacity, few economic problems {{compare with the}} developing-country debt problem. When the Mexican payments crisis erupted in August 1982, it was the immediate threat to {{the stability of the}} international financial system that concentrated the minds of policymakers, at least in the creditor countries. However, the general hope, if not the expectation, was that the severity of the threat would diminish fairly quickly as the developing countries "adjusted" their economies, with the assistance of debt rescheduling and some new lending, so as to restore their creditworthiness and economic growth. Indeed, the threat has diminished, but not because of successful adjustment or restoration of creditworthiness in <b>heavily</b> <b>indebted</b> developing <b>countries.</b> The threat to the financial system has eased as commercial banks have sharply reduced the share of their assets and capital exposed to the troubled debtor countries.

40|$|There {{is now a}} large {{literature}} that attributes the investment decline in <b>heavily</b> <b>indebted</b> <b>countries</b> {{to the effects of}} the international debt crisis which began in 1982. However, these countries also faced falling export prices and high world real interest rates in the early 1980 s, and these shocks could have directly caused investment to decline. One way to test for debt effects is to see whether equations without any debt-related information can nevertheless forecast the investment declines that these countries experienced. This paper shows that such equations can forecast investment in many <b>indebted</b> <b>countries,</b> and thus casts doubt on many debt-related explanations for the investment declines.
