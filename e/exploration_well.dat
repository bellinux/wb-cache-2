2500|$|Licences conferring {{rights to}} {{hydrocarbon}} exploration on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland were first awarded by the Canadian {{government in the}} mid-1960s. The first <b>exploration</b> <b>well</b> in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin was the Murre G-67 well drilled in the southern, relatively uplifted end of the basin by the oil majors Amoco and Imperial Oil in 1971. [...] Soon after, a small, non-commercial amount of oil was test flowed in early 1973 at the Adolphus 2K-41 <b>exploration</b> <b>well</b> drilled in the much more deeply buried northern end of the Jeanne d'Arc Basin by Mobil Oil Canada and Gulf Canada. The Egret K-36 well, drilled jointly by Amoco, Imperial and Skelly in 1973, was a critical milestone in establishment of the basin's hydrocarbon prospectivity. Egret K-36 encountered the prolific oil source rock later assigned the name Egret Member, plus thick tilted beds of porous sandstones of the Jeanne d'Arc and Hibernia formations. [...] Despite this early establishment that all the components needed for an active petroleum system were present, there was a four-year hiatus in drilling in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin following termination of the Adolphus D-50 well in January 1975. The first well spud after the drilling lull proved that giant oil fields {{could be found in}} this basin. [...] The Hibernia P-15 discovery well, initiated on May 27, 1979, encountered and test flowed oil from the Jeanne d'Arc, Hibernia and Ben Nevis formations. This well heralded a vibrant era of oil exploration and development that has significantly impacted the economy of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador.|$|E
2500|$|One {{element that}} is {{absolutely}} essential for successful exploration and development {{is the presence of}} a stratigraphic unit that is capable of hydrocarbon generation. The presence of an excellent quality Upper Jurassic source rock in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin was first identified in well cuttings from the Egret K-36 <b>exploration</b> <b>well.</b> [...] This Kimmeridgian package of organic-rich, thinly interbedded and finely laminated marlstones and calcareous shales was formally defined as the Egret Member of the Rankin Formation. [...] These economically important beds have been demonstrated to be present across the Jeanne d'Arc Basin. [...] Microscopic analyses identified abundant bituminous/liptinitic detrital material and a lack of terrestrial organic matter. [...] These characteristics indicate that the Egret Member is dominated by marine-derived Type II organic matter deposited under reducing conditions. [...] Hydrocarbons trapped throughout the Jeanne d'Arc Basin were mainly sourced from the prolific Egret Member.|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-1970s, oil {{companies}} began {{drilling in the}} Canadian part of the Beaufort Sea. In order to overcome the relatively short operating window of drillships during the ice-free season (100 to 110 days a year) and the water depth limitations of artificial dredged islands, Gulf Canada Resources began developing an Arctic drilling system consisting of two mobile drilling units: a Mobile Arctic Caisson (MAC) that could be submerged and filled with gravel to form an artificial drilling island in waters up to [...] in depth and a floating Conical Drilling Unit (CDU) designed for drilling in water depths between [...] while afloat. These units, each capable of completing one <b>exploration</b> <b>well</b> per year, would be supported by four Arctic Class 4 vessels: two large icebreakers providing 24-hour ice management and standby services on the drilling site and two smaller icebreaking vessels responsible for anchor handling and supply runs between the drilling rigs and coastal bases. By 1982, both drilling units and all four icebreaking vessels were under construction in Canada and Japan for BeauDril, Gulf Canada's drilling subsidiary, and the company had committed itself to a billion-dollar exploration program between 1983 and 1988.|$|E

The present water depths of the Dorado North, Dorado and Barracuda wells are 1346.4, 1383 and 1509  m, respectively. The sampling depths of the Dorado North, Dorado and Barracuda wells are 2200 – 3622, 2150 – 3288 and 2139 – 4741  m, respectively (Fig.  2). The Dorado and Barracuda wells were plugged as gas discovered wells, and the Dorado North was plugged as a dry well.

5000|$|Thermal {{gradient}} holes (TGH), <b>exploration</b> <b>wells</b> (slim holes), and full-scale production wells (wildcats) {{provide the}} most reliable information on the subsurface. [...] Temperature gradients, thermal pockets and other geothermal characteristics can be measured directly after drilling, providing valuable information. Geothermal <b>exploration</b> <b>wells</b> rarely exceed 4 km in depth. Subsurface materials associated with geothermal fields range from limestone to shale, volcanic rocks and granite. [...] Most drilled geothermal <b>exploration</b> <b>wells,</b> up to the production well, are still considered to be within the exploration phase. Most consultants and engineers consider exploration to continue until one production well is completed successfully. [...] Generally, the first wildcat well has a success rate of 25%. Following more analysis and investigation, success rates then increase to a range from 60% to 80%. Although expenses vary significantly, drilling costs are estimated at $400/ft. [...] Therefore, it is becoming paramount to investigate other means of exploration before drilling operations commence. To increase the chances of successfully drilling, innovations in remote sensing technologies have developed over the last 2 decades. These less costly means of exploration are categorized into multiple fields including geology, geochemistry and geophysics.|$|R
