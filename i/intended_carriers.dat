All the children are listed as the children of Noble Rot Senior Citizens and Section 9 begins to suspect a larger conspiracy when {{they are part of}} a larger body of 20,000 children. Soon afterwards, the Puppeteer causes the disappearance of the sixteen children and Batou reveals to Togusa that he believes Kusanagi to be the Puppeteer. Section 9 next intercepts a Siak sniper that is targeting the supposed mastermind of Ka Rum's assassination. After his capture it is revealed the informant and the target are one in the same. The sniper says that the Puppeteer is a mechanism in the Solid State and cannot be killed.|$|E

It {{focuses on the}} optimal selection of transportation modes, i. e. the size and frequency of shipments, from a central storage location to all markets inside Europe. Tactical organisation means that {{the objective is to}} determine the characteristics of the shipments, to serve as a basis for contract negotiations with the <b>intended</b> <b>carriers.</b> The problem is modelled as a mixed-integer linear program, and solved accordingly. Then simulation is used to check the robustness of the optimal results. The results indicate a potential reduction of total transportation costs of 36 %. Simulation indicates a deviation of only 4 %. Its main characteristics are a reduced shipping frequency for small customers, indicating that marketing will have {{to be involved in the}} practical implementation. Additional strategic options, regarding adding distribution centres (DCs), were also investigated with the same model...|$|E

50|$|The BlackBerry Storm 9530 is an {{international}} and worldwide electronic communicating device, featuring CDMA with EV-DO Rev. A data, UMTS with HSDPA, and quad-band GSM with EDGE data access speed. The BlackBerry Storm 9500 {{does not include the}} CDMA module and is destined for use outside North America. However, the BlackBerry Storm only has European, Oceania, Asia and Brazil UMTS and HSDPA frequency bands. Therefore, if the BlackBerry Storm is used with GSM wireless carriers in North America, the BlackBerry Storm will only be able to access wireless internet at EDGE data speed maximum. This is because GSM carriers in North America, namely AT&T, T-Mobile, Rogers and Fido do not operate on the same frequency bands for 3G {{as the rest of the}} world. If BlackBerry Storm is used in Europe, Africa, Asia, Oceania or Brazil, HSDPA wireless data speed can be achieved, provided that the local GSM network supports it. The phone will use the primary network technology of its <b>intended</b> <b>carrier</b> (Verizon) when traveling domestically in the US, and rely upon the GSM/UMTS/HSDPA networks of Vodafone mainly when traveling abroad. There are currently no unlocked and unbranded versions available for the GSM Blackberry Storm however unlocking the phone will allow it to be used with any GSM service provider.|$|R

SFDC was less degraded in the presence of lysozyme and E. coli and was degraded by B. thetaiotaomicron but not by faecal slurry. The results obtained with SFDA were promising because this NP showed good encapsulation parameters for both active ingredients and biological degradability by E. coli and faecal slurry.
