Dominantly inherited cutaneous and neurocutaneous porphyrias (porphyria cutanea tarda, hereditary coproporphyria, variegate porphyria and erythropoietic protoporphyria) have been associated with solar urticaria.

He was the first to isolate mouse tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), and to demonstrate the inflammatory potential of this cytokine, proving its important role in endotoxin-induced shock. Subsequently, he invented recombinant molecules expressly designed to neutralize TNF, fusing the binding portion of TNF receptor proteins to the heavy chain of an <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>molecule</b> to force receptor dimerization. These molecules were later used extensively as the drug Etanercept in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, and other forms of inflammation.|$|E

The surfaces of the transformed lymphocytes were examined by indirect immunofluorescence for the presence of T cell antigens and <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>molecules.</b> More than 90 % of lymphocytes that underwent blast transformation after exposure to foreign histocompatibility antigens (mixed lymphocyte reaction; in vitro allograft reaction), purified tuberculin, phytohemagglutinin (PHA), and concanavalin A (Con-A) had T cell antigenic markers on their surfaces. 70 – 92 % of the antigen-stimulated blast cells also had readily detectable surface <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>molecules,</b> whereas less than 3 % of the PHA- and Con-A-activated cells were Ig+. Pokeweed mitogen (PWM) appeared to activate both B and T cells, but the T cells did not have detectable surface <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>molecules.</b> Nonactivated control cultures contained T+Ig- lymphocytes almost exclusively. The results suggest that thymus-dependent rat lymphocytes express increased amounts of detectable immunoglobulin on their surface in response to specific stimulation with antigen.

50|$|Immunoglobulins {{recognize}} foreign antigens and initiate immune responses such as phagocytosis and the complement system. Each <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>molecule</b> {{consists of}} two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains. There are two classes of light chains, kappa and lambda. This region represents the germline organization of the lambda light chain locus. The locus includes V (variable), J (joining), and C (constant) segments. During B cell development, a recombination event at the DNA level joins a single V segment with a J segment; the C segment is later joined by splicing at the RNA level. Recombination of many different V segments with several J segments provides {{a wide range of}} antigen recognition. Additional diversity is attained by junctional diversity, resulting from the random additional of nucleotides by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase, and by somatic hypermutation, which occurs during B cell maturation in the spleen and lymph nodes. Several V segments and three C segments are known to be incapable of encoding a protein and are considered pseudogenes. The locus also includes several non-immunoglobulin genes, many of which are pseudogenes or are predicted by automated computational analysis or homology to other species.|$|E
40|$|Tumor {{cells from}} a patient with B-cell {{lymphoma}} were fused with a mouse myeloma cell line. A set of heterohybridomas was thus derived, each of which represented a separate clonal derivative from the tumor cell population. The immunoglobulins secreted by these cell lines reacted variably with a panel of anti-idiotypic antibodies, indicating that the tumor was heterogeneous; however, one antibody, 4 D 6, reacted strongly with the product of all the heterohybridomas. cDNA for the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable-region genes expressed in these heterohybridomas was cloned and sequenced. Comparison of these sequences indicated that the cells expressing them were clonally related but that they had undergone considerable mutation. Despite mutation, the cells in this tumor population continued to express a functional <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>molecule</b> and to retain, over a span of 3 years, the idiotypic determinant defined by the 4 D 6 monoclonal antibody.

40|$|Autoimmune {{reactions}} are in most circumstances considered to represent damaging or at best neutral phenomena for the individual. In {{the present article}} {{we would like to}} describe an autoimmune system, which we consider to carry great promise with regard to both theoretical and clinical immunology. No evidence exists that genes, that code for the antigen-binding sites of <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>molecules,</b> have been under any phylogenetic selective pressure as to avoid the creation of sites with reactivity for self-components. Failure of an individual to express immune reactivity against self can thus frequently be ascribed to a phenomenon occurring during ontogeny, that is specific immune paralysis. Several levels of tolerance would seem to exist that to a varying degree involve different subsets of lymphocytes. One decisive factor in determining whether immune paralysis will occur or not is the concentration of the respective self-component in the body fluids.
