50|$|Research {{regarding}} Mendelian genetics was {{prohibited by}} Joseph Stalin under the Soviet regime. This prohibition and resulting Lysenkoism, {{along with his}} 1948 loss of job {{as the head of}} the Department of <b>Fur</b> <b>Animal</b> Breeding at Moscow's Central Research Laboratory of Fur Breeding, led Belyayev to conceal his work on domestication under the veil of animal physiology research. Belyayev was interested in dog diversity, and wanted to know more about how genes change throughout time. He believed that behavior has strong biological and physiological roots, with strong relations to hormones and neurochemicals. Thus, he decided to study the silver fox and to observe how the fox responds to selective pressures for tame behavior.|$|E

5000|$|The {{origin of}} the name [...] "Nokia" [...] is obscure. In modern Finnish, noki means soot and nokia is its inflected plural, {{although}} this form of the word is rarely if ever used. The most common theory claims the name actually originates from the archaic Finnish word nois (pl. nokia) or nokinäätä ("soot marten"), meaning sable. After sable was hunted to extinction in Finland, the word was applied to any dark-coated <b>fur</b> <b>animal,</b> such as the marten, which {{are found in the}} area to this day. The sable is enshrined on the Nokia coat of arms. However, later research has appeared to indicate that sables never inhabited Finland in the first place, and the name nois may actually refer to the beaver.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fur</b> <b>animal</b> {{production}} on an industrial scale {{started in the}} 1930s in Denmark. Denmark is now the world’s largest producer of mink furs, with 1,400 mink farmers fostering 17.2 million mink and producing around 14 million furs {{of the highest quality}} every year. Approximately 98 per cent of the skins sold at Kopenhagen Fur Auction are exported. Fur ranks as Danish agriculture’s third largest export article, at more than DKK 7 billion annually. The number of farms peaked in the late 1980s at more than 5,000 farms, but the number has declined steadily since, as individual farms grew in size. Danish mink farmers claims their business to be sustainable, feeding the mink food industry waste and using all parts of the dead animal as meat, bone meal and biofuel. Special attention is given to the welfare of the mink, and regular “Open Farm” arrangements are made for the general public. Mink thrive in, but are not a native to Denmark, and it is considered an invasive species. American Mink is now widespread in Denmark and continues to cause problems for the native wildlife, in particular waterfowl. Denmark also has a small production of fox, chinchilla and rabbit furs.|$|E

She owns the armor of her fashion. How shes feels inside matches her outside." [...] McGhee also stated that Cookie's sense of fashion was inspired by Michelle Obama. Henson said of the character's immense and varied wardrobe, [...] "It’s like fashion on crack! It’s high drama, I get to dress up and wear things I can’t afford or that I just wouldn’t buy because I’m cheap."

40|$|A {{new type}} of pyoderma was {{detected}} in Finnish <b>fur</b> <b>animals</b> in 2007. The disease continues to spread within and between farms, with severe and potentially fatal symptoms. It compromises animal welfare and causes considerable economic losses to farmers. A case-control study was performed in 2010 – 2011 to describe the entity and to identify the causative agent. Altogether 99 <b>fur</b> <b>animals</b> were necropsied followed by pathological and microbiological examination. The data indicated that the disease clinically manifests in mink (Neovison vison) by necrotic dermatitis of the feet and facial skin. In finnraccoons (Nyctereutes procyonoides), it causes painful abscesses in the paws. Foxes (Vulpes lagopus) are affected by severe conjunctivitis and the infection rapidly spreads to the eyelids and facial skin. A common finding at necropsy was necrotic pyoderma.

40|$|<b>Fur</b> <b>animal</b> feed {{production}} in Finland Annually approximately 400 million kg <b>fur</b> <b>animal</b> feed is manufactured in Finland. The feed is manufactured mainly from domestic feedstuffs. Vitamins and minerals are also {{added to the}} feed {{to meet the requirements}} of the animals. Fresh feed is composed almost 80 % of meat by-products, fish and cooked or dehydrated barley. In addition, meat and fish meals are also added. Feedstuffs, such as soybean meal or soy concentrate, corngluten and wheatgluten meals, potato protein and are also used when economically viable to do so. Mainly the slaughterhouse by-products and fox carcasses are acidified. Finnish Food Safety Authority controls the use of acids and preservatives. Due to national legislation all slaughter by-products at Finnish slaughterhouses must be acidified to pH 4. 0 or below before the by-products may leave the slaughterhouse. According to national legislation slaughter by-products must be grinded to a maximum particle size of 50 mm and the by-products must be treated with either sorbic acid or benzoic acid to prevent outgrowth of yeast and moulds. The most common combination for preservation is formic acid and Na-benzoate. Also sulphuric acid, formic acid- lactic acid solution and sodium metabisulphite solution have been used. Neutralisation is used in Finland. Most common way of neutralisation is the use of soda (Na 2 CO 3). Calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2) is also used. Every 15 feed kitchen in Finland take part in a systematic feed quality control by Finnish Fur Breeders Association (FFBA). The quality control requires minimum 2 feed samples per month from each feed kitchen.

The excreta properties can be improved in composting process. European Union legislation permits fertilization use of composted <b>fur</b> <b>animal</b> excreta. The aim of the research was to determine the dynamics of some heavy metals content (Fe, Mn and Ni) during the composting process of coypu and chinchilla excreta. Composted were excreta without additions (control) as well as excreta with 20 % and 40 % addition of leaves and straw. The composting process was conducted in PVC containers in a closed place. The composting lasted 25 weeks. During that time moisture of the materials was kept at a constant level, and every two weeks the materials were mixed for aeration purpose. Samples of the materials were taken after 11, 13, 15, 23 and 25 weeks of the composting process. Heavy metals content was determined by ICP-AES method. The heavy metals content in the examined composts was decreasing in order: Fe>Mn>Ni. While analyzing the heavy metals content in composts, as a rule the lowest content of elements was determined in composts with straw addition. Moreover, from among the three components used t...|$|E
40|$|<b>Fur</b> <b>Animal</b> Epidemic Necrotic Pyoderma (FENP) is a severe, often lethal {{infectious}} disease affecting all three <b>fur</b> <b>animal</b> species: mink (Neovision vision), foxes (Vulpes lagopus) and finnraccoons (Nyctereutes procyonoides). Previous studies showed {{an association between}} Arcanobacterium phocae and FENP. An experimental infection was conducted to confirm the ability of A. phocae to infect mink either alone or concurrently with a novel Streptococcus sp. found together with A. phocae in many cases of FENP. Different inoculation methods were tested to study possible routes of transmission. Typical signs, and gross- and histopathological findings for FENP were detected when naïve mink were infected with the tissue extract of mink with FENP, using a subcutaneous/ intradermal infection route. Edema, hemorrhage, necrosis and pus formation were detected in the infection site. A pure culture preparation of A. phocae alone or concurrently with the novel Streptococcus sp. caused severe acute signs of lethargy, apathy and anorexia and even mortality. The histopathological findings {{were similar to those}} found in naturally occurring cases of FENP. In contrast, the perorally infected mink presented no clinical signs nor any gross- or histopathological lesions. This study showed that A. phocae is able to cause FENP.
