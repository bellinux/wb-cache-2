Pérez de BenitoThe {{complexation}} of chromium(III) by L-glutamic acid / <b>hydrogen</b> <b>L-glutamate</b> ion in aqueous media under slightly {{acidic conditions}} (pH 2. 46 - 5. 87) {{has been studied}} {{by the use of}} UV-Vis spectroscopy. Although the reaction {{in the presence of a}} large excess of organic ligand is considered in the chemical literature to be a pseudo-first order kinetic process, the rate-time plots corresponding to the formation of the reaction product show a distinct bell-shaped profile, caused by the accumulation of a long-lived intermediate. Given that this intermediate is not reactive enough for the steady state approximation to apply, an integrated rate law involving a double-exponential function has been used to obtain two rate constants for each kinetic experiment, corresponding to the formation of the long-lived intermediate from the reactants (k 1) and to its decay into the reaction products (k 2). Both rate constants increased with the initial concentration of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>L-glutamate</b> ion in a double-reciprocal linear relationship, k 1 decreased with the ionic strength whereas k 2 increased, both evidenced the existence of base catalysis and the corresponding activation energies were 83 ± 10 and 95 ± 5 kJ mol- 1, respectively. The spectroscopic data indicated the formation of several complexes, differing in the number of organic ligands per chromium atom and in their acid-base properties. A mechanism in agreement with the available experimental data has been proposed, involving the breakage of a Cr(III) -aqua chemical bond as a previous step to the coordination of the organic ligan...|$|R

In 1828, Hennell and the French chemist Georges-Simon Serullas independently discovered that sulphovinic acid could be decomposed into ethanol.

40|$|The form of {{cytochrome}} o that predominates in Vitreoscilla cells having {{various levels}} of respiratory activity was studied by using untreated, frozen-thawed, and starved cells, which had respiratory rates decreasing in the order given. Direct spectral observation revealed that the oxygenated form of cytochrome o predominated during the aerobic steady-state oxidation of endogenous substrate or exogenous glutamate in untreated and frozen-thawed cells {{and was replaced by}} the reduced form when the cell suspensions became anaerobic. The respiratory rates, estimated inversely from the time of duration of the steady state, were correlated to the rates of oxygen consumption for the various cells. Oxidized cytochrome o predominated in aerobic starved cells.

The oxygenated form also appeared after the addition of hydrogen peroxide to the cells, but only the oxidized form appeared when <b>ethyl</b> <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide was added.

Ethanol is very soluble under these conditions: effective Henry's law coefficients, H*, range from 4 x 10 (exp 4) M/atm in the 227 K, 39 wt % acid to greater than 10 (exp 7) M/atm in the 76 wt % acid.

40|$|Catalase is {{a heroin}} {{containing}} enzyme. This fact was rendered very probable {{by the discovery}} of a modified heroin spectrum in purified enzyme solutions from animal and plant tissues by Zeile and Hellstr~m (1, 2). They found that the ratio between catalytic activity and porphyrin bound iron in a given preparation remained constant in the course of fractionation and inactivation experiments. This ratio may, however, vary considerably in different preparations, even from the same type of tissue. Besides the approximate position of the absorption bands of the enzyme in the visible region, the spectrum of the cyanide and sulfo-complex and that of the pyridine hemochromogen derived from the enzyme hemin were described.

40|$|Fosamine {{ammonium}} inhibits {{growth in}} woody plants and some herbs. It apparently prevents dormant tissues from becoming active and growing again, but its exact {{mode of action}} is not understood. When applied in late summer or early fall, effects are generally not visible until the following spring when treated vegetation fails to bud-out. Pine species can be treated during spring and summer, and their growth will be inhibited shortly thereafter. Few studies on the environmental fate and toxicity of fosamine ammonium have been conducted by independent researchers. This lack of research may be due, in part, to the relatively low toxicity and rapid microbial degradation of this herbicide. Fosamine ammonium is highly water soluble, but appears to bind readily with at least some soils. It is readily degraded by soil microbes and has a half-life in soils ranging from one to two weeks, which limits its movement. It is not readily degraded by abiotic chemical reactions or photolysis, but low pH and high temperatures {{have been shown to}} facilitate its breakdown. It is stable in water, but is generally degraded rapidly by microbes in aquatic sediments. Fosamine is only very slightly toxic to birds, mammals, fish, and aquatic invertebrates.

40|$|Rapidly {{increasing}} {{world population}} {{in recent years}} brings about an increasing demand for nutri-tion, {{which is one of}} the most important problems for mankind. Various methods have been discussed in order to solve this problem. One of these meth-ods is using chemicals against harmful organisms in plants. The use of pesticides in agricultural areas increases the plant yield; however, some chemical substances may result in pollution in nature and health problems. The effects of pesticides used in high concen-trations in the world have been dealt with and investigated by various researchers from differ-ent aspects. For this reason, a number of studies were carried out to determine harmful effects of pesticides (Soriano 1984, El-Khodary et al. 1987). Detrimental effects of fungicide sprays on fruit set and yield in crops such as cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) were reported (Özgen and Palta 2001). Furthermore, it was stated that pesticides had often prevented cell division (Yoshida et al. 1983). A lot of work was done to study the effects of fungicides on pollen germination and pollen tube growth (He et al. 1995). Harmful effects of fungicides on pollen germination (Watters and Sturgeon 1990) and pollen tube growth (Marcucci et al. 1983) were demonstrated for commercially important plants. Although many studies have been conducted on the effects of fungicides on pollen germination and pollen tube growth, very few studies have been carried out handling the impact of fungicides on the pollen morphology and viability. This study was thus conducted to determine whether fungicide fosetyl-Al affects morphol-ogy and viability of Lycopersicon esculentum Mill pollen.

40|$|Ion/molecule {{reactions}} {{performed by}} pentaquadrupole mass spectrometry {{are used to}} generate cluster ions in which neutral pyridines are bound to the polyatomic cation SF 3 +. The dimeric ions Py 1 SF 3 +Py 2, where Py 1 and Py 2 represent substituted pyridines, are shown to have loosely bound structures by collision-induced dissociation (MS 3) experiments and by semiempirical AMI and ab initio RHF/ 6 - 31 G(d, p) molecular orbital calculations. In the case of dimers comprised of meta- and/or para-substituted pyridines (unhindered pyridines), there is an excellent linear correlation between the logarithm of the fragment ion abundance ratio ln[Py 1 (SF 3 +) ]/[Py(SF 3 +) ] and the proton affinities (PA) of the constituent pyridines. Semiempirical calculations are used to estimate the SF 3 + affinities of pyridines which {{are found to be}} in the range of 25 – 31 kcal/mol. The SF 3 + affinities show an excellent linear correlation with the proton affinities of the pyridines, and the relationship SF 3 + affinity (kcal/mol) = 0. 73 PA — 135. 8 between the two affinities is derived. The effective temperature of the dimeric ions is determined to be 595 ± 69 K, which is in good agreement with values of around 600 K obtained experimentally in studies on many other systems activated under similar conditions. Ortho-substituted pyridines show lower than expected affinities due to stereoelectronic effects that decrease the cation affinities. Gas-phase Stereoelectronic parameters (Sk) are measured from the deviation from the PA correlation and are ordered as 2 -MePy (− 1. 09) < 2, 6 -diMePy (− 1. 11) < 2 -EtPy (− 1. 91) < 2, 3 -diMePy (− 2. 15) < 2, 5 -diMePy (− 2. 25) < 2, 4 -diMePy (− 2. 40). Overall, the steric effects are larger than those in the corresponding Cl+-bound dimers but smaller than those in the bulky [OCNCO+] system. Calculations show evidence for agostic bonding that offsets the steric effects in some cases. The eclipsed conformation of 2 -methylpyridine/SF 3 + adduct is found to be more stable than the staggered form by 0. 8 kcal/mol, due to auxiliary agostic bonding between the hydrogen of the ortho methyl substituent and the sulfur atom. Calculations on atomic charge distribution reveal that the positive charge is mainly on the sulfur atom (+ 1. 99) and the charge on the bonding hydrogen S-H-C (+ 0. 07) is considerably lower than that on the other two methyl hydrogens (+ 0. 14), which appears to be a good indication of agostic binding. The most stable form of the 2 -ethylpyridine/SF 3 + adduct is found when the N-C 1 -Cα-Cβ dihedral angle is approximately 60 °, where the <b>ethyl</b> <b>hydrogen</b> is directed toward the SF 3 group via an interesting six-membered ring alignment. The experiments show a remarkably small steric effect in 2, 6 -dimethylpyridine, probably due to strong agostic bonding enhanced by the buttressing effect that shortens the S-H distance. In addition, the face-to-face interactions of the F atoms and the H atoms further stabilize this form...|$|R

The quantitative analysis of these effects shows that the change in linewidth is due to a marked decrease in the extent of coupling between the heme vibronic transitions and the protein low-frequency motions. The relevance of the vinyl groups in the dynamics of the heme-globin interaction is highlighted by this experimental approach which shows that the protein is capable of transmitting structural information to the heme by coupling the ensemble of the low-frequency modes to the stereochemistry of the vinyl itself. This mechanism, which entails adjustment of the equilibrium between vinyl torsional conformers, represents an additional pathway for the control of the heme reactivity in addition to the iron-histidine link.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The two components, AhpF and AhpC, of the Salmonella typhimurium alkyl {{hydroperoxide}} reductase enzyme {{system have}} been overexpressed and purified from Escherichia coli for investigations of their catalytic properties. Recombinant proteins were isolated in high yield (25 - 33 mg per liter of bacterial culture) and {{were shown to}} impart {{a high degree of}} protection against killing by cumene hydroperoxide to the host E. coli cells. We have developed quantitative enzymatic assays for AhpF alone and for the combined AhpF/AhpC system which have allowed us to address such issues as substrate specificity and inhibition by thiol reagents for each protein. All assays gave identical results whether overexpressed S. typhimurium proteins from E. coli or proteins isolated directly from S. typhimurium were used. Anaerobic hydroperoxide reductase assays have demonstrated that cumene hydroperoxide, <b>ethyl</b> hydroperoxide, and <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide can all be reduced by the combined enzyme system. AhpF possesses multiple pyridine nucleotide-dependent activities [5, 5 ′-dithiobis(2 -nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) reductase, oxidase, transhydrogenase, and, in the presence of AhpC, peroxide reductase activities]. Although AhpF can use either NADH or NADPH as the electron donor for these activities, NADH is the preferred reductant (Km,app of AhpF for NADH was more than 2 orders of magnitude lower than that for NADPH when analyzed using DTNB reductase assays). Thiol-modifying reagents react readily with each reduce...|$|R
40|$|Harden and Walpole (1905) {{found that}} glucose {{fermented}} by Aerobacter aerogenes yielded formic, lactic, acetic and succinic acids, carbon dioxide, <b>hydrogen,</b> <b>ethyl</b> alcohol, 2, 3 -butylene glycol and acetylmethylcarbinol. Scheffer (1928) has confirmed these as the the only products formed in appreciable quantities. On {{the basis of}} carbon balances obtained from analyses of com-pleted fermentations, the latter investigator proposed a break-down of glucose to methylglyoxal-hydrate which stabilized as lactic acid or split into formic acid and acetaldehyde-hydrate or into pyruvic acid and hydrogen. The pyruvic acid yielded CO 2 and acetaldehyde, the latter with the acetaldehyde-hydrate formed acetylmethylcarbinol or was reduced to ethyl alcohol. 2, 3 -Butylene glycol was formed by reduction of the carbinol, and formic acid was split into CO 2 and H 2. The formation of acetylmethylcarbinol and 2, 3 -butylene glycol from glucose has been of interest {{as an example of}} the enzymatic coupling of carbon compounds. Neuberg and Hirsch (1921) demonstrated that acetaldehyde is condensed to acetylmethyl-carbinol by yeast when added to fermentations of glucose and presented evidence supporting the suggestion that the condensa-tion involves one molecule of added and one of biologically formed acetaldehyde (Neuberg and Simon, 1933). The reversion of acidity caused by Aerobacter is of interest in connection with the work to be reported. Ayers and Rupp (1918), among others, found that this reversion can take plac...|$|R
40|$|A {{strain of}} Spirochaeta aurantia was {{isolated}} from mud by a procedure involving migration of the organisms through cellulose ester filter discs (0. 3 -μm pore diameter) {{onto the surface}} of culture plates. The helical cells measured 0. 3 by 10 to 20 μm during exponential growth. Electron microscopy showed the presence of two subterminally inserted axial fibrils partially overlapping in a 1 - 2 - 1 arrangement. An outer envelope, exhibiting a polygonal substructure, was observed. The spirochete grew either aerobically or anaerobically, with aerobic yields of 9. 8 × 108 cells per ml and anaerobic yields of 3. 0 × 108 cells per ml. The organism used carbohydrates, but not amino acids, as energy sources. Amino acids served as sole nitrogen sources, whereas inorganic ammonium salts did not. The presence of biotin and thiamine in the medium was required for growth. Growing cells fermented maltose mainly to carbon dioxide, <b>hydrogen,</b> <b>ethyl</b> alcohol, and acetic acid. Small amounts of formic and lactic acids, acetoin, and diacetyl were produced. Cells of S. aurantia growing aerobically produced a yellow-orange pigment. Chemical analysis indicated that the pigment was carotenoid in nature, its main component being lycopene or a similar compound. S. aurantia is not closely related to the leptospires, since it lacks both the hemolytic antigen and the hooked ends typical of the latter organisms. Furthermore, the guanine plus cytosine content in the deoxyribonucleic acid of S. aurantia (66. 8 moles%) differs drastically from that of leptospires...|$|R
40|$|The {{conversion}} of ethene, carbon monoxide {{and water to}} propanoic acid by the catalytic action of various rhodium species, was investigated by infra-red spectroscopy and autoclave batch reactions. Utilisation of a high pressure infra-red cell and a Fourier Transform infra-red spectrometry enabled study of the spectra of the catalytic systems at temperatures up to 180 ºC, and at pressures of 10 - 150 bar. The batch autoclave reactions enable rates, yield and selectivities to be determined {{with the aid of}} Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectroscopy. Rhodium halides were used as precursors and the effects of solvents, water, iodide initiators, were studied. It was shown that polar solvents favoured hydrocarbonylation as did hydrous conditions. <b>Ethyl</b> iodide and <b>hydrogen</b> iodide were active initiators, however hydrogen iodide was observed to poison the catalyst forming [Rh(CO) (_ 2) I(_ 4) ](^-) and other rhodium(III) species. At temperatures above 170 ºC rhodium(I) species such as [Rh(CO) (_ 2) I(_ 2) ](^-) were more prominent. A novel catalyst system was produced by employing rhodium(III) chloride, tin(II) chloride and hydrochloric acid. The nature of this system was studied in terms of solvents, the interaction of rhodium and tin, and the role of hydrogen chloride. Infrared studies revealed rhodium-tin species in the reaction media. Studies were conducted to ascertain the role of cations and additives. Further studies determined the activity of other metals as co-catalysts to rhodium, showing tin to be a superior co-catalyst...|$|R
40|$|Prominent {{nonlinear}} {{effects in}} enantioselectivity were observed with a transient technique when ethyl pyruvate was hydrogenated over Pt/Al 2 O 3 {{in the presence}} of two cinchona alkaloids, which alone afford the opposite enantiomers of ethyl lactate in excess. The changes in reaction rate and ee, detected after injection of the second alkaloid, varied strongly with type and amount of the alkaloid, and with the order of their addition to the reaction mixture. For example, under ambient conditions in acetic acid cinchonidine (CD) afforded 90 % ee to (R) -ethyl lactate and addition of equimolar amount of quinidine (QD) reduced the ee to (R) -ethyl lactate only to 88 %, though QD alone provided 94 % ee to (S) -lactate in a slightly faster reaction. The stronger adsorption of CD on Pt {{in the presence of}} hydrogen and acetic acid was proved by UV–vis spectroscopy. The different adsorption strengths result in an enrichment of CD on the Pt surface and also in a crucial difference in the dominant adsorption geometries. CD is assumed to adsorb preferentially via the quinoline rings laying approximately parallel to the Pt surface. In this position it can interact with <b>ethyl</b> pyruvate during <b>hydrogen</b> uptake and control the enantioselectivity. The weaker adsorbing QD adopts mainly a position with the quinoline plane being tilted relative to the Pt surface and these species are not involved in the enantioselective reaction. Competing hydrogenation of the alkaloid, and steric and electronic interactions among the adsorbed species, can also influence the alkaloid efficiency and the product distribution. Hydrogenation of the quinoline rings at low alkaloid concentration resulted in unprecedented swings in the enantiomeric excess...|$|R
