40|$|The {{object was}} {{to study the}} {{relation}} between virus and the transmitting insect, especially the aphids Myzus persicae Sulz., Myzus pseudosolani Theob., Macrosiphum solanifold Ashm., Aphis rhamni Fonsc. and Aphis fabae Scop. The diseases studied were leafroll, common mosaic (virus A), crinckle (virus Y), stipple streak (virus Yc), <b>interveinal</b> <b>mosaic</b> (virus X), aucuba mosaic (virus F) and spindling sprout. The aphids transmitted these viruses, except aucuba mosaic virus. M. persicae was the best transmitter. The development stage of the aphid was of no influence. A specific relation between M. persicae and leafroll virus was found. Only after incubation of the virus in the insect for 2448 h was the aphid able to transmit leafroll virus. After living 10 days on a resistant plant the aphid {{was still able to}} infect the potato plant but the virus could not be transmitted from mother insect to offspring. When the virus-bearing aphid cast its skin the leafroll virus was not lost. The virus was transmitted downwards to the tubers in about 4 weeks. The susceptibility of young plants was very high, in contrast to older plants (old- age resistance) ...|$|E
40|$|In March, 2013, twenty {{symptomatic}} freesia plants (10 {{plants of}} cultivar Shiny Lemon and 10 plants of cultivar Shiny Gold), with striking virus-like symptoms {{were collected in}} Cheongju, Korea. The plants showed chlorotic, coalescing, <b>interveinal,</b> whitish, necrotic, <b>mosaic,</b> mottling or dark brown-to-purple necrotic spots on leaves. Freesia crude sap was directly analyzed by transmission electron microscopy, which potyvirus particles as well as long virus-like particles were detected. Total RNA extracts were analyzed for the infection of Freesia sneak virus (FreSV) by reverse transcription (RT) -PCR with primers specific to FreSV coat protein (CP) gene based on the sequences of FreSV isolates (GenBank No. GU 071089, FJ 807730 and DQ 885455), showing 9 of 20 plants were infected. All 1305 bp RT-PCR products were cloned and sequenced. Comparisons of nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences using BLAST and bioinformatics tools resulted in 99 to 100...|$|R
