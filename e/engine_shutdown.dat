5|$|The HPOTP turbine and HPOTP {{pumps are}} {{mounted on a}} common shaft. Mixing of the fuel-rich hot gases in the turbine section and the liquid oxygen in the main pump can create a hazard and, to prevent this, the two {{sections}} are separated by a cavity that is continuously purged by the engine's helium supply during engine operation. Two seals minimize leakage into the cavity; one seal is located between the turbine section and the cavity, while the other is between the pump section and cavity. Loss of helium pressure in this cavity results in automatic <b>engine</b> <b>shutdown.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>engine</b> <b>shutdown</b> {{procedure}} was {{changed for the}} launch of Skylab to avoid damage to the Apollo Telescope Mount. Rather than shutting down all four outboard engines at once, they were shut down {{two at a time}} with a delay to reduce peak acceleration further.|$|E

None of the 4 crew were injured and there were no casualties on the ground.|$|E
25|$|The {{first stage}} of Falcon 9 Flight 6 {{performed}} the first test of a controlled descent and propulsive landing over water on 29 September 2013. Although not a complete success, the stage was able to change direction and make a controlled entry into the atmosphere. During the final landing burn, the ACS thrusters could not overcome an aerodynamically induced spin, and centrifugal force deprived the landing engine of fuel leading to early <b>engine</b> <b>shutdown</b> and a hard splashdown which destroyed the first stage.

25|$|The EDS was {{distributed}} throughout the vehicle and includes some components in the IU. There were nine EDS rate gyros installed at location 15 in the IU. Three gyros monitored {{each of the three}} axes (pitch, roll and yaw), providing triple redundancy. The control signal processor (location 15) provided power to and received inputs from the nine EDS rate gyros. These inputs were processed and sent to the EDS distributor (location 14) and to the flight control computer (location 16). The EDS distributor served as a junction box and switching device to furnish the spacecraft display panels with emergency signals if emergency conditions existed. It also contained relay and diode logic for the automatic abort sequence. An electronic timer (location 17) was activated at liftoff and 30 seconds later energized relays in the EDS distributor which allowed multiple <b>engine</b> <b>shutdown.</b> This function was inhibited during the first 30 seconds of launch, to preclude the vehicle falling back into the launch area. While the automatic abort was inhibited, the flight crew can initiate a manual abort if an angular-overrate or two-engine-out condition arose.|$|E
25|$|Turbine {{engines in}} use on today’s turbine-powered {{aircraft}} are very reliable. Engines operate efficiently with regularly scheduled inspections and maintenance. These units can have lives ranging {{in the thousands}} of hours of operation. However, engine malfunctions or failures occasionally occur that require an engine {{to be shut down}} in flight. Since multi-engine airplanes are designed to fly with one engine inoperative and flight crews are trained to fly with one engine inoperative, the in-flight shutdown of an engine typically does not constitute a serious safety of flight issue. Following an <b>engine</b> <b>shutdown,</b> a precautionary landing is usually performed with airport fire and rescue equipment positioned near the runway. Once the airplane lands, fire department personnel assist with inspecting the airplane to ensure it is safe before it taxis to its parking position. Turboprop-powered aircraft and turboshaft-powered helicopters are also powered by turbine engines and are subject to engine failures for many similar reasons as jet-powered aircraft. In the case of an engine failure in a helicopter, it is often possible for the pilot to enter autorotation, using the unpowered rotor to slow the aircraft's descent and provide a measure of control, usually allowing for a safe emergency landing even without engine power.|$|E
25|$|The second non-fatal {{incident}} occurred on 14 January 1969. It involved a BUA mainline BAC One-Eleven 201AC (registration: G-ASJJ) operating a scheduled international passenger flight from Milan's Linate Airport to London Gatwick. This {{was the same}} aircraft BUA had used to operate the One-Eleven's inaugural revenue service. On {{the day of the}} accident, the aircraft had been diverted to Linate on the outbound flight because of fog at Genoa's Cristoforo Colombo Airport. A normal take-off run was followed by a bang immediately after the aircraft had become airborne. The captain in the jumpseat who was supervising the co-pilot at the time thought that there was a problem with the no. 1 engine. He advised the pilot in command to close the throttle a short while later. The pilot in command followed this advice and lowered the nose pitch from 12 to six degrees. The <b>engine</b> <b>shutdown</b> was accompanied by an decrease in airspeed from 140 knots (161mph/ 259km/h to 115 kn (132mph / 212km/h). Although the aircraft was damaged beyond repair in the resulting forced landing on snow-covered sand about two miles from the end of runway 18, there were no fatalities among the 33 occupants (seven crew and 26 passengers) though there were two serious injuries. The accident investigators concluded that this crash was caused by the crew failing to recognise their mistake, which had resulted in shutting down the wrong engine (no. 1) in error following a compressor bang/surge in the no. 2 engine. In addition, the crew did not notice that an inadvertent movement of the relevant throttle lever had partially reduced the no. 2 engine's thrust.|$|E

50|$|During {{the early}} 1980s the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) began {{rethinking}} its {{policy on the}} minimum number of engines an aircraft needed to be permitted to fly long distances non-stop over water. The FAA's rethink had been prompted by the increasing reliability of jet engines powering new widebodied airliners {{as well as other}} technological advances. Mid-air <b>engine</b> <b>shutdowns</b> that necessitated an emergency landing at the nearest diversion airfield and which could harm the structure and/or occupants had become a rare phenomenon. The result was ETOPS, a set of rules permitting twin-engined aircraft to fly long over water routes, provided that there were usable diversion airfields within 120 minutes' non-stop flying distance plus a 15% margin from the aircraft's route.|$|R

500|$|STS-93 [...] – At T+5 seconds, an {{electrical}} short disabled one primary and one secondary controller {{on two of}} the three engines. In addition, a 0.1-inch diameter, 1-inch long gold-plated pin, used to plug an oxidizer post orifice, came loose inside an engine's main injector and impacted the engine nozzle inner surface, rupturing three hydrogen cooling lines. The resulting three breaches caused a leak resulting in a premature <b>engine</b> <b>shutdown</b> due to increased propellant consumption.|$|E
500|$|Several {{in-flight}} shutdowns of Trent 700–powered A330-300s occurred. On 11 November 1996, {{engine failure}} on a Cathay Pacific flight forced {{it back to}} Ho Chi Minh City. On 17 April 1997, Cathay Pacific's subsidiary Dragonair experienced an <b>engine</b> <b>shutdown</b> on an A330, caused by carbon clogging the oil filter. As a result, Cathay Pacific self-suspended its 120-minute ETOPS clearance. [...] Another engine failure occurred on 6 May during climbout with a Cathay Pacific A330, due to a bearing failure in a Hispano-Suiza-built gearbox. Three days later, a Cathay Pacific A330 on climbout during a Bangkok–Hong Kong flight experienced an oil pressure drop and a resultant engine spool down, forcing a return to Bangkok. The cause was traced to metal contamination in the engine's master chip. Following a fifth engine failure on 23 May, Cathay Pacific and Dragonair voluntarily grounded their A330 fleets for two weeks, causing major disruption as Cathay's eleven A330s made up fifteen per cent of its passenger capacity. Rolls-Royce and Hispano-Suiza developed a redesigned lubrication system to resolve the problem.|$|E

The particular vehicle selected as the platform for this study is a prototype of the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) capable of carrying a 5 ton payload. Peak stand-by power requirements for onboard power are determined from the projected future digitized battlefield vehicle requirements. Strategic selection of electrified engine accessories enables <b>engine</b> <b>shutdowns</b> when the vehicle is stopped, thus providing additional fuel savings.

The results indicate six-fold improvements of the silent watch fuel economy with the FC APU compared to main-engine idling, and relatively modest improvements from the mild electrification and FC APU use during the driving cycle.

5000|$|The KORD (Russian {{acronym for}} KOntrol Raketnykh Dvigateley—literally [...] "Control (of) Rocket Engines"—Russian: Контроль ракетных двигателей) was the {{automatic}} {{engine control system}} devised to throttle, shutdown and monitor the large cluster of 30 engines in Block A (the first stage). The KORD system controlled the differential thrusting {{of the outer ring}} of 24 engines for pitch and yaw attitude control by throttling them appropriately and it also shut down malfunctioning engines situated opposite each other. This was to negate the pitch or yaw moment diametrically opposing engines in the outer ring would generate, thus maintaining symmetrical thrust. Block A could perform nominally with two pairs of opposing engines shut down (26/30 engines), Block B with one pair of opposing <b>engines</b> <b>shutdown</b> (6/8 <b>engines)</b> and Block V with one engine shut down (3/4 engines). Unfortunately the KORD system was unable to react to rapidly occurring processes such as the exploding turbo-pump during the 5L launch. Due to the deficiencies of the KORD system a new computer system was developed for the last launch, vehicle 7L, called the S-530. It was the first Soviet digital guidance and control system.

40|$|Abstract. Aero {{engines are}} {{extremely}} reliable machines and operational failures are rare. However, currently great effort {{is being put}} into {{reducing the number of}} in-flight <b>engine</b> <b>shutdowns,</b> aborted take-offs and flight delays through the use of advanced engine health monitoring technology. This represents a benefit to society through reduced delays, reduced anxiety and reduced cost of ownership of aircraft. This is reflected in a change of emphasis within aero engine companies where, instead of selling engines to customers, there is a fundamental shift to adoption of power-by-the-hour contracts. In these contracts, airlines make fixed regular payments based on the hours flown and the engine manufacturer retains responsibility for maintaining the engine. To support this new approach, improvements in in-flight monitoring of engines are being introduced with the collection of much more detailed data on the operation of the engine. At the same time advances have been made in Internet technologies providing a worldwide network of computers {{that can be used to}} access and process that data. The explosion of available knowledge within those large datasets also presents its own problems and here it is necessary to work on advanced decision support systems to identify the useful information in the data and provide knowledge-based advice between individual aircraft, airline repair and overhaul bases, world-wide data warehouses and the engine manufacturer. This paper presents a practical framework in which to build such a system that is inherent in the emerging Grid computing paradigm that provides the necessary computing resources. A demonstrator system already developed and implemented in the UK E-Science Grid project, DAME, is introduced. ...|$|R

CSG compression facilities in some production sites suffered underproduction in recent summers because of frequent automatic <b>engine</b> <b>shutdowns.</b> The problem is not expected by the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s design. However, it is suspected of being related to the control systems on the compression facilities triggering the overheating-protection shutdowns due to possible deficiencies in one or some water/gas cooling loops in the facilities’ air-cooled heat exchangers. Therefore, to understand which heat exchangers and what exact reasons cause the unexpected cooling issue, {{an investigation}} {{has been carried out}} on the cooler units of the gas compression facilities. A field instrumentation measurement on one operating cooler unit has been done, followed by an analysis using a one-dimensional analytical model and a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics model. The experimental results are used to validate both the models. Then the cooling performance of the cooler unit under the summer peak condition is predicted by the verified models. The prediction suggests that the water inlet temperature in one particular cooler section is higher than its upper limit defined by the manufacturer, due to poor cooling at high ambient temperatures. The lower cooling performance is caused by large reductions in the cooler air speed and total heat transfer coefficient, which are related to less efficiency of the cooler fans, more airflow resistance, and fouling {{on both sides of the}} finned tubes...|$|R
