5|$|Professor Nathan Katz {{writes of}} {{the analogy of}} a burning building, used by the Buddha in the Lotus Sutra, which casts {{religious}} language as imperative. In the analogy, a father sees his children {{at the top of}} a burning building. He persuades them to leave, but only by promising them toys if they leave. Katz argues that the message of the parable <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Buddha has been telling lies; rather, he believes that the Buddha was illustrating the imperative use of language. Katz believes that religious language is an imperative and an invitation, rather than a truth-claim.|$|E
5|$|The only {{objection}} <b>is,</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Court acted {{beyond its}} jurisdiction, {{but that it}} erred in its judgment of the law applicable to the case. If, then, we are to give any relief in this case, it is by a revision of {{the opinion of the}} Court, given {{in the course of a}} criminal trial, and thus asserting a right to control its proceedings, and take from them the conclusive effect which the law intended to give them. If this were an application for a habeas corpus, after judgment on an indictment for an offence within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, it could hardly be maintained, that this court could revise such a judgment, or the proceedings which led to it, or set it aside, and discharge the prisoner.|$|E

He has nerves {{of steel and}} thews of whipcord", even if [...] "he's starting {{to look a little}} older." [...] Doolittle was fulsome in his praise for the novel, saying [...] "Fleming's new book will not disappoint his millions of fans". Writing in The New York Times, Anthony Boucher—described by a Fleming biographer, John Pearson as [...] "throughout an avid anti-Bond and an anti-Fleming man"—was again damning, although even he admitted that [...] "you can't argue with success". However, {{he went on to say}} that [...] "simply pro forma, I must set down my opinion that this is a silly and tedious novel." [...] Boucher went on to bemoan that although On Her Majesty's Secret Service was better than The Spy Who Loved Me, [...] "it is still a lazy and inadequate story", going on to say that [...] "my complaint <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> adventures of James Bond are bad literature... but that they aren't good bad literature". Boucher finished his review lamenting that [...] "they just aren't writing bad books like they used to." ...|$|E

2500|$|Globally, Indigenous feminists have {{suggested}} reevaluating identity politics to work towards justice {{in a more}} comprehensive way. In addressing the United Nations, Winona LaDuke has explained how Indigenous feminism might work, [...] "if we are to seek and struggle for common ground of all women, {{it is essential to}} struggle on this issue. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> women of the dominant society in so-called first world countries should have equal pay and equal status, if that pay and status continues to be based on a consumption model which is not only unsustainable, but causes constant violation of the human rights of women and nations elsewhere in the world." [...] Indigenous feminist activism includes a broad scope of actions, but center Indigenous women's experiences.|$|E

2500|$|In 1870, {{a federal}} grand jury {{determined}} that the Klan was a [...] "terrorist organization" [...] and issued hundreds of indictments for crimes of violence and terrorism. Klan members were prosecuted, and many fled from areas that were under federal government jurisdiction, particularly in South Carolina. Many people not formally inducted into the Klan had used the Klan's costume to hide their identities when carrying out independent acts of violence. Forrest called for the Klan to disband in 1869, arguing that it was [...] "being perverted from its original honorable and patriotic purposes, becoming injurious instead of subservient to the public peace". Historian Stanley Horn argues that [...] "generally speaking, the Klan's end was more in the form of spotty, slow, and gradual disintegration than a formal and decisive disbandment". A Georgia-based reporter wrote in 1870: [...] "A true statement of the case <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Ku Klux are an organized band of licensed criminals, but that men who commit crimes call themselves Ku Klux".|$|E
2500|$|Dewey {{believed}} that the successful classroom teacher possesses a passion for knowledge and an intellectual curiosity in the materials and methods they teach. [...] For Dewey, this propensity is an inherent curiosity and love for learning that differs from one’s ability to acquire, recite and reproduce textbook knowledge. [...] "No one," [...] according to Dewey, [...] "can be really successful in performing the duties and meeting these demands [...] who does not retain [...] intellectual curiosity intact throughout [...] entire career" [...] (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.34). [...] According to Dewey, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> “teacher ought to strive to be a high-class scholar in all the subjects {{he or she has}} to teach,” rather, “a teacher ought to have an unusual love and aptitude in some one subject: [...] history, mathematics, literature, science, a fine art, or whatever” (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.35). [...] The classroom teacher {{does not have to be}} a scholar in all subjects; rather, a genuine love in one will elicit a feel for genuine information and insight in all subjects taught.|$|E
2500|$|Since then, {{there has}} been {{considerable}} scholarly argument among art historians on the occasion represented. Edwin Hall considers that the painting depicts a betrothal, not a marriage. [...] Margaret D. Carroll argues that the painting is {{a portrait of a}} married couple that alludes also to the husband's grant of legal authority to his wife. Carroll also proposes that the portrait was meant to affirm Giovanni Arnolfini's good character as a merchant and aspiring member of the Burgundian court. She argues that the painting depicts a couple, already married, now formalizing a subsequent legal arrangement, a mandate, by which the husband [...] "hands over" [...] to his wife the legal authority to conduct business on her own or his behalf (similar to a power of attorney). The claim <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> painting had any legal force, but that van Eyck played upon the imagery of legal contract as a pictorial conceit. While the two figures in the mirror could be thought of as witnesses to the oath-taking, the artist himself provides (witty) authentication with his notarial signature on the wall.|$|E

2500|$|A {{collection}} of private correspondence published by David Ben Gurion contained {{a letter written}} in 1937 which {{explained that he was}} in favour of partition because he didn't envision a partial Jewish state {{as the end of the}} process. Ben Gurion wrote [...] "What we want <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> country be united and whole, but that the united and whole country be Jewish." [...] He explained that a first-class Jewish army would permit Zionists to settle in the rest of the country with or without the consent of the Arabs. Benny Morris said that both Chaim Weizmann and David Ben Gurion saw partition as a stepping stone to further expansion and the eventual takeover of the whole of Palestine. Former Israeli Foreign Minister and historian Schlomo Ben Ami writes that 1937 was the same year that the [...] "Field Battalions" [...] under Yitzhak Sadeh wrote the [...] "Avner Plan", which anticipated and laid the groundwork for what would become in 1948, Plan D. It envisioned going far beyond any boundaries contained in the existing partition proposals and planned the conquest of the Galilee, the West Bank, and Jerusalem.|$|E
2500|$|... This {{theory was}} {{forwarded}} at the 2008 Rhodesian Ridgeback World Congress, and contends that an honest {{evaluation of the}} breed's functional history indicates that during its formative development and early use as a breed, the ridgeback was much more a [...] "hunter's/farmer's ox-wagon dog" [...] {{than it was a}} [...] "lion dog". This theory aligns itself with the current FCI classification of the breed, group 6.3 (a special type of scenthound). However, the important distinction in this theory <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> FCI classification of [...] "scenthound" [...] is accurate, but rather, that placing the Dalmatian and the Rhodesian ridgeback (the only breeds currently in FCI group 6.3), breeds that historically have served as versatile hunting/wagon dogs, should indeed be classified as two examples of the same type of dog, but further asserts that such dogs’ classification makes more sense as a discrete group. This classification theory is generally supported by historical accounts that mirror the one offered by Phyllis Archdale who went to Southern Africa in 1919 and bred ridgebacks there in the 1920s, [...] "Old timers told me that in early days most Dutch transport riders had a Ridgehound as guard to their wagons. They were used to bail up lion and wild pig. Mine did both..." ...|$|E

[...] In his opinion the artists selected exemplified [...] "Euro-art, a term I've {{made up to}} describe {{a certain kind of}} technically competent, bland, and ultimately empty art made specifically for international biennales." [...] Similarly, Jonathan Jones wrote in The Guardian that the show [...] "reflect a mentality only too dominant in art magazines and curating right nowa rather overthought, overtalked, pseudo-intellectual culture." [...] In The Times, Rachel Campbell-Johnston wrote, [...] "I can't help thinking that this show will prove ... like the returns desk of Ikea on a Monday morning. Lots of frustrated people will be left staring at a pile of inscrutable junk." [...] In the Financial Times, Jackie Wullschlager wrote, [...] "Don’t go. Don’t even think about going. This year’s Turner Prize exhibition is without competition the worst {{in the history of the}} award.... a killer mix of self-indulgence and academicism." [...] Laura Cumming in The Observer agreed, [...] "If ever you were thinking of giving the Turner Prize a miss then 2008 is the ideal year." [...] saying that [...] "t <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> art is wilfully bad ... it is just that it is almost entirely inactive." [...] In contrast, Adrian Searle wrote in The Guardian: [...] "here's a depth and complexity [...] that, it would be nice to think, might overtake the usual chat about winners and losers." ...|$|E
