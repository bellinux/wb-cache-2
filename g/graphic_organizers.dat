But retell a story is not easy, students have problems in the process of retelling story; especially they cannot organize their ideas about the story. So in the learning process, students need a tool to help them visualize and organize their thought. Story maps, one of the kinds of <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer</b> that featured areas for students to fill in the basic story element. The main goal of the usage of story map is to improve students retelling story skill. A <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer</b> technique is an outline of concepts that uses twodimensional format to illustrate connection and hierarchies between concepts. Story map {{is one of}} types of <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer</b> {{that can be used to}} help students in retelling story. It helps students to generate ideas as they develop and note their thought visually. This research investigated the implementation of <b>Graphic</b> <b>Organizer</b> Technique that is used by first grade students of MAN 2 Cirebon in relation to their monologue. Two reasons that addressed in this study are how is <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer</b> technique implemented in the class and how does it contribute to the students’ skill in retelling story. Thus, this research is conducted to identify the implementation of <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer</b> technique in the class and find out the contribution of <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer</b> technique in students’ retelling story skill. The results of this study show that the students retelling story skill can be improved. So that students can be helped and students’ learning problem can be minimized. It can be concluded that story map is constructive tool that help the students in learning process, especially in retelling story season. After analyzed the monologue, the researcher conclude that the aspect of monologue that most conspicuous from the students retelling story’s transcript is the students construction of the text. They reconstructed their ideas to make story and retell it. Finally, the researcher expects this research will be able to help the next researcher who conducts the research in the same field. It is suggested to further researchers to be able to investigate other objects which might contain <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer</b> technique and use another theory of <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer</b> technique...|$|R

The scored {{obtained}} from the students at SMPN 18 Banda Aceh showed that the students had problems in writing skill, because, according to observation in preliminary research, the teacher did not use any media in teaching writing. The objective {{of this study was}} to find out the impact of implementing <b>Graphic</b> <b>Organizer</b> strategy in improving students' writing skill. The writer gave 3 meeting of treatments by using <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer</b> instruction. Thus, this research was included as an experimental study with one "group pre-test post-test design. The sample of this research was chosen. by using random sampling technique consisting 23 second grade students of SMPN 18 Banda Aceh. The writer followed the procedures of quantitative research in which the data was gathered using written test before and after the treatments were given. Then, the collected data were analyzed statistically with the t-test formula. Finally, after analyzing the data collected, it was found that there was an improvement on the students' writing ability after the treatments. The result showed that hypothesis (Ha) was accepted since the score of t-test (1. 7) was higher than the t-table (0. 4599). In conclusion, <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer</b> as a tool in the prewriting stage can be applied as a solution to students' writing problems. With the positive findings of this study, it might be a good reference for teachers to start implementing <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer</b> in the writing class. i...|$|R
