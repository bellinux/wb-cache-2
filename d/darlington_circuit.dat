40|$|A {{solid state}} {{amplifier}} has an output transistor stage and an input transistor stage interconnected as a <b>Darlington</b> <b>circuit.</b> An interstage transistor interconnecting the collectors of the two stages of the <b>Darlington</b> <b>circuit</b> is connected with the first stage transistor in a compound configuration. When the load current furnished by the amplifier {{is less than a}} predetermined value, the output stage operates as a simple saturated switch with its base drive current flowing through the emitter-base junction of the first stage which produces no collector current because the base-emitter junction of the interstage transistor is reverse-biased. When the load current exceeds said predetermined value, the interstage transistor begins to conduct allowing the input and output stages to operate as a Darlington amplifier and diverting {{a significant portion of the}} base drive current of the output transistor back into the load...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – A {{new design}} {{topology}} and {{performance for the}} ultra wideband Darlington amplifier is described. The amplifier configuration consists of a common-emitter transistor pair with low-pass filter. The normalized gain characteristic for the amplifier provides 1. 36 multiple expansion of frequency band without degradation of the dynamic range, at VSWR and matching of input-output retaining. Expression for the optimum transfer factor was received. On this base the amplifier module for measuring and communication devices is created. This paper will discuss the design theory, techniques, and measurements of this newly developed <b>Darlington</b> <b>circuit.</b> I...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a measurement system for blue light blocking lens. The main features of the system are using a light pulse modulator and filtering circuit technology to prevent ambient light interference, no any expensive optical filters are needed. Our system is composed of a transmitter circuit, a receiver circuit and a signal processing circuit. The transceiver driving circuit including the modulated LED of 10 kHz and measured the light signals from unwanted noise and unmodulated all light by a photodiode, and then converted by the transimpedance amplifer. The transmitter <b>circuit</b> uses <b>Darlington</b> drive <b>circuit</b> to optimize the LED operating current. The percentage error of the transmittance data is nearly 6 %, compared with that of the OCEAN USB 2000 spectrometer's, so proved that this device is feasibility. This experiment has also shown that the chromaticity coordinates will be changed when using blue light lens. Based on the experiment, the brightness of the blue light blocking lenses cannot be too low which will cause color deviation problems. From the analysis result in table 4, the color deviation is nearly 17 % at green blocking blue light lenses and 21 % at yellow blocking blue light lenses on y coordinates. Therefore, these two blocking blue light lenses are not suitable for use as blue light blocking lenses. The color deviation of coated blue film and brown 20 % blocking blue light lens have nearly 3 % on x-y coordinates. But, those of 8 % in 30 % brown and 17 % in green lenses are also not suitable for blue light blocking lens using. Thus the most suitable for blue light blocking lenses using is 20 % brown blocking lens. In the future, this proposed device may be used as a powerful measurement tool on the eyeglasses test line...|$|R
50|$|From the owner's manual:The {{adoption}} of a single-stage differential amplifier with low-noise dual transistors, a current mirror load and a 3-stage <b>Darlington</b> triple SEPP <b>circuit</b> provides a bumper power output of 270 watts + 270 watts (20 Hertz to 20,000 Hertz {{with no more than}} 0.03% THD) which is extremely stable. The power amplifier is configured as a DC power amplifier with the capacitors removed from the NFB circuit for a flat gain response. The large-sized toroidal transformers with their superb regulation employ 22,000 µF large-capacity electrolytic capacitors (two per each channel). There are independent dual power supply circuits with separate power transformer windings to provide power for the left and right channels. The FM front end incorporates a two-stage RF circuit that employs a 5-gang tuning capacitor and three dual gate MOS FETs for high gain and low noise. This configuration excels in ridding the sound of undesirable interference. The FM IF amplifier combines five dual-element ceramic filters…for high selectivity (80 dB) and low distortion… The local oscillator includes Pioneer’s very own quartz sampling locked APC (Automatic Phase Control). This output of this extremely precise quartz oscillator is divided into frequencies of 100 kHz and so reception frequencies which are a multiple of 100 kHz are locked at every 100 kHz.|$|R

This system consists of hardware and software. The hardware consists of AC motor, stepping motor, power circuit, <b>darlington</b> <b>circuit,</b> microcontroller AT 89 S 51 circuit and limit switch. The software use assembly Reads 51 programming. The first step to start the work system are arrange the tick of cassava, then put cassava at the cassava place. At this moment limit switch pressed by cassava, so that give low input to mikrocontroler. Mikrocontroler will commanding steeping motor to rotating according with the tick option that we’ve choosen at the first step until limit switch give high input to mokrocontroler, that is at the time when cassava has been sliced till it used up (limit switch in unpress condition). At this time limit switch give high input to mikrocontroler, then mikrocontroler commanding stepping motor to turn around until the first position of stepping motor.

40|$|A bipolar {{fabrication}} {{service has}} been developed at the Rochester Institute of Technology to service students and faculty from the Microelectronic, Electrical and Computer Engineering departments wanting to realize designed integrated circuits. The fabrication technique combined Implanted N-Well and double diffusion processes. Phosphorous was implanted into a p-type substrate, oxidized for eight hours and diffused in nitrogen for another 40 hours to create isolated n-wells. Devices were then fabricated using a double diffusion process. The CAD tool used for the service is the Integrated Circuit Editor, ICE, which has campus wide accessibility through the RIT VAX system. Designed standard cells include resistors, bipolar and MOS transistors, a current mirror, a differential amplifier, a <b>Darlington</b> <b>circuit</b> and an operational amplifier. Full custom circuits can also be designed using ICE. Maskmaking files generated from circuit designs are sent to the Microelectronic Engineering department for circuit fabrication, and the completed circuits are returned to the designer for testing. The RIT N-Well process has provided vertical NPN and PNP transistors with common emitter current gains of 100 and 40 respectively, Early voltages greater than 50 volts, and breakdown voltages higher than 15 volts. Differential amplifiers and current mirrors have alos been successfully designed, fabricated and tested...|$|E
