Parametric studies have been carried out for each proposed advanced architecture, providing engine cycle mid-cruise design point parameters. Design sensitivity studies related to intercooling technology in combination with a PDC are further explored for a number of heat-exchanger design effectiveness values and associated pressure loss levels. The acquired results suggest that the incorporation of PDC technology within a conventional core has the potential to significantly improve engine thermal efficiency. Incorporating intercooling improves the cycle performance for any pre-combustion OPR above 10 and contributes to an increase in specific power over the entire range of OPR.

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{published}} in the Journal of Propulsion and Power and the definitive published version is available at [URL] development of radical new aero engine technologies will be key to delivering the step-changes in aircraft environmental performance required to meet future emissions legislation. Intercooling has the potential for higher overall pressure ratios, enabling reduced fuel consumption, and/or lower compressor <b>delivery</b> <b>air</b> temperatures and therefore reduced NOx. This paper considers the aerodynamics associated with the complex ducting system that would be required to transfer flow from the core engine path to the heat exchanger system. The cycle benefits associated with intercooling could be offset by the pressure losses within this ducting system and/or any detrimental effect the system has on the surrounding components. A suitable branched S-shaped duct system has been numerically developed which diffuses and delivers the flow from the engine core to discrete intercooler modules. A novel swirling duct concept was used to locally open larger spacing between certain duct branches in order to provide engine core access whilst hiding the resultant pressure field from the upstream turbomachinery. The candidate duct system was experimentally evaluated on a bespoke low speed, fully annular isothermal test facility. Aerodynamic measurements demonstrated the ability of the design to meet the stringent aerodynamic and geometric constraints...|$|E

Higher expression of EGFP and hatchability were obtained when 18 -day-old embryos were inoculated through the amniotic cavity using a cationic lipid adjuvant containing polyethylenimine (PEI-ExGen®). Transgene expression was observed even when low amounts of plasmid DNA were used (1 µg/egg). A dose-dependent response was observed with plasmid DNA concentrations of 1, 10, 25, 60 and 100 µg/egg.

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] breakdown (GB) and overripeness (OR) remain the biggest internal Problems with Prunus armeniaca L. ‘Imperial’, which makes the biggest contribution to the total volume of apricots exported from South Africa per annum. Prunus salicina L. ‘Pioneer’, an early season South African plum cultivar, ripens quickly {{on and off the}} tree which results in rejections for soft fruit at packing and on arrival overseas. ‘Songold’, a yellow, midseason plum cultivar tends to develop GB and OR during cold-storage in some seasons, which renders the fruit inedible and results in high rejection rates. Prompt cooling and good temperature management are essential to lower the rate of physiological deterioration of stone fruit. In some commercial depots in South Africa, forced air cooling (FAC) of stone fruit can take as long as 48 to 72 h, {{depending on the type of}} packaging. Consequently, the objective of this study was to determine the effect of the rate and duration of FAC on the fruit quality of different stone fruit cultivars. Fruit was subjected to the following FAC rates at a <b>delivery</b> <b>air</b> temperature of - 1. 0 °C to a pulp temperature of 0 °C for 6 h, 12 h, 24 h stepwise cooling and 48 h stepwise cooling for the apricot, and 12 h, 24 h, 48 h stepwise cooling, and 72 h stepwise cooling for the two plum cultivars. The fruit was evaluated after cold-storage and a simulated shelf-life period. The trial was conducted in two consecutive seasons. ‘Imperial’ apricots had the best internal quality after 6 h of FAC, ‘Pioneer’ plums were not affected by FAC rate or duration, and ‘Songold’ plums had the best internal quality when FAC was applied for 12 h and longer. These results on plums demonstrate that cultivar differences must be considered when drawing up handling protocols for stone fruit, as a blanket recommendation may lead to the induction of quality defects...|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] South African plum industry is an important supplier of fresh fruit to the northern hemisphere from December to April. Extensive use is made of a dual- temperature shipping regime, which {{is a form of}} intermittent warming, in order to limit the occurrence of chilling-related internal defects like gel breakdown (GB) and internal browning (IB). The perception in industry is that use of the 12 m integral reefer containers leads to more quality defects than are experienced in conventional reefer vessels using the same temperature regimes. It was hypothesised that there are significant temperature variances in the integral reefers and three pallets of Sapphire plums were therefore wired with thermocouples to log pulp and air temperatures during commercial shipping to the United Kingdom. Results indicated that the <b>delivery</b> <b>air</b> temperature (DAT) was very close to the set point, and that the container therefore had the refrigeration capacity to maintain the DAT within acceptable tole- rances. Air temperatures within the pallets, however, varied significantly, with peaks of up to 12 °C at a set point of 7. 5 °C. The fruit pulp temperatures showed similar deviations. As expected, fruit in the pallet closest to the doors showed the slowest reaction to changes in temperature, and those in the pallet closest to the cooling unit, the most rapid. Fruit in the 4 th layer on the pallet, closest {{to the base of the}} pallet, reacted fastest to changes in set point, and fruit in the 10 th layer, close to the middle of the pallet, generally reacted the slowest. All fruit were deemed ‘ripe and ready to eat’ upon arrival, and no IB ir GB were found. Mention was made, however, of significant levels of shrivel, which may have been aggravated by the fairly low relative humidity in the container. Further trials are underway to investigate the relationship between fruit quality and the temperature gradients in reefer containers, using cultivars with differing metabolic rates...|$|E
40|$|Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) {{remains a}} serious problem for {{commercial}} broiler producers throughout the world. An in ovo delivery system for plasmid DNA vaccines was evaluated by studying parameters, such as the route of <b>delivery</b> (<b>air</b> cell vs amniotic cavity), transfection reagent (IFA+DMSO vs polyethylenimine), dose of plasmid DNA (1 to 100 µg/egg), {{and the nature of}} humoral immune responses. An optimal response was detected when embryos were inoculated with 60 µg of plasmid DNA. This system for in ovo delivery was used to determine the efficacy of a plasmid DNA vaccine against IBDV in 18 -day-old embryos. The DNA vaccine expresses the polyprotein VP 2 -VP 4 -VP 3 of IBDV. SPF and fertile broiler eggs with maternal antibodies were vaccinated and challenged against IBDV-STC. Two groups of birds (SPF and broilers) received a booster immunization with baculovirus expressed-proteins of IBDV. The DNA vaccine had no detrimental effect on hatchability or first week post-hatch survival. In ovo vaccination generated detectable humoral immune responses as measured by ELISA. Antibody response was significantly enhanced two weeks post the IBDV-protein boost. Broilers vaccinated with plasmid DNA or IBDV-protein boost exhibited partial protection against IBDV-STC strain, whereas, vaccinated SPF chicks were not protected and exhibited severe microscopic lesions after challenge. A second approach in the control of IBDV used a recombinant attenuated vaccine administered in ovo to 18 -day-old embryos. The vaccine was genetically tailored to protect from challenges in the field against classic and variant strains of IBDV. SPF and fertile broiler eggs were vaccinated and used to evaluate protection against IBDV-STC challenge. A full dose of the vaccine consisting of 5. 6 x 103 pfu was administered to SPF and commercial broiler embryos. In addition, a half dose containing 2. 3 x 103 pfu was injected in SPF embryos. The vaccine generated high antibody titers in chickens vaccinated with either dosage. All vaccinated groups were protected against mortality. The vaccine did not cause bursal damage and fully protected SPF chicks vaccinated in ovo with 2. 3 x 103 pfu and broiler embryos that received a full dose of the recombinant vaccine. The vaccine had no effect on hatchability or first week survival in either broilers or SPF birds, even when high doses were administered...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access. As aero gas turbine designs strive for ever greater {{efficiencies}} {{the trend is}} for engine overall pressure ratios to rise. Although this provides greater thermal efficiency it means that cycle temperatures also increase. Traditionally turbines have {{been the focus of}} cooling schemes to enable them to survive high temperatures. However, it is envisaged that the compressor <b>delivery</b> <b>air</b> will soon reach temperatures which mean they may require similar cooling strategies to the turbine. One such concept is akin to that of a turbine 'rim purge flow which ensures that hot, mainstream flow does not get ingested into rotor cavities. However, the main gas path in compressors is generally more aerodynamically sensitive than in turbines and introduction of a purge flow may be more penalizing. It is important to understand the impact such a flow may have on the primary gas path flow of a compressor and the downstream combustion system aerodynamics. This paper presents a preliminary investigation into the effects of a purge flow which enters the main gas path immediately upstream of the high pressure compressor outlet guide vane (OGV) row. Initial, simplified, CFD predictions clearly demonstrated the potential of the purge flow to negatively affect the OGV/pre-diffuser and alter the inlet conditions to the combustion system. Consequently, an experimental assessment was carried out using an existing fully annular, isothermal test facility which incorporated a bespoke 1. 5 stage axial compressor, engine relevant outlet guide vanes, pre-diffuser and downstream combustor geometry. Using CFD to guide the process the test rig was modified to allow a metered airflow to be introduced upstream of the outlet guide vanes. Importantly the flow was directed up the face of the rotor such that it picked up a representative swirl component prior to injection into the main gas path. The experimental data confirmed the CFD results and importantly demonstrated that the degradation in the combustor inlet flow resulted in an increased combustion system loss. At the proposed purge flow rate, equal to ∼ 1 % of the mainstream flow, these effects were small with the system loss increasing by ∼ 4 %. However, at higher purge flow rates (up to 3 %) these effects became notable and the OGV/pre-diffuser flow degraded significantly with a resultant increase in the combustion system loss of ∼ 13 %...|$|E

Acta Horticulturae, (599), 443 - 450 Horticultural exports are of economic significance to New Zealand. Only through providing consistently high quality products to distant markets can New Zealand hope to command a premium price. New Zealand's two major horticultural exports, apples and kiwifruit, are transported to foreign markets by sea; either in refrigerated holds on-board cargo vessels or in refrigerated containers. Long transit times mean that conditions in these systems {{must be carefully}} controlled to ensure high quality product arrives at market. Effective distribution of air is a key consideration in transport systems. A mathematical model to describe the flow of air in marine transport systems was developed. The model {{was based on a}} resistance network framework, relying on simplification of the complex geometry within the refrigerated space to a discrete number of flow paths and points of convergence and divergence. Correlations quantifying the flow resistance of each channel were required. Some of these correlations were already available, and some were developed specifically for this purpose. A general method for predicting the flow resistance of enclosed conduits based on the Darcy-Weisbach, laminar and Colebrook equations was found to be sufficiently accurate for use. The flow resistance of horizontally vented horticultural packages was quantified and the cause of the flow resistance investigated. Entrance and exit effects were found to be significant, and a relationship between vent size and flow resistance was developed. Air interchange between a vented carton and the general refrigerated space was shown to be a significant mode of heat transfer. The effect of vent design on the rate of air interchange was found to be complex. Quantitative relationships between vent characteristics and rates of air interchange could not be developed; however, some general observations were made. Vent size, aspect ratio and alignment were all found to affect the rate of interchange. An existing method for determining in-package fluid velocities was refined to improve the accuracy of data and reduce the measurement time. A low-cost method for measuring airflows in transport systems was also developed utilising thermistors. These thermistor anemometers were used to monitor velocities in four shipments of fresh produce from New Zealand. Three of the four vessels monitored showed large variation in the circulation rate in the period between evaporator defrosts due to frosting. In some cases, frosting was severe enough to cause loss of <b>delivery</b> <b>air</b> temperature control. Management of defrosts was identified as an area of improvement in refrigerated hold management. Validation of the model developed was performed using four systems: a laboratory scale test-rig, a 40 ' container and two of the surveyed refrigerated holds. Airflow predictions were used with a heat transfer model to predict in-package temperatures. Comparison of measured and predicted flows and in-package temperatures showed good agreement given uncertainty of geometry and input data. The implications of altering a number of operational and design variables in both containers and refrigerated holds were investigated using the developed models. Increased circulation rates were found to increase cooling rates and reduce temperature variability in both types of systems; however, the magnitude of the benefit decreased with increasing circulation rate. Removal of the floor gratings and the use of pallet bases as an air distribution channel was found to increase temperature variability in both types of systems. The magnitude of the increase was small in a 40 ' container but substantial in a refrigerated hold. The correlations and models developed in this thesis provide useful tools to analyse and optimise the design and operation of refrigerated marine transport systems...|$|E
