25|$|Daniel Barringer (1860–1929) {{was one of}} {{the first}} to {{identify}} an impact crater, Meteor Crater in Arizona; to crater specialists the site is referred to as Barringer Crater in his honor. Initially Barringer's ideas were not widely accepted, and even when the origin of Meteor Crater was finally acknowledged, the wider implications for impact cratering as a significant <b>geological</b> <b>process</b> on Earth were not.|$|E
25|$|Heap {{leaching}} is an {{extraction process}} by which chemicals (usually sulfuric acid) are used to extract the economic element from ore which has been mined and placed in piles on the surface. Heap leaching is generally economically feasible only for oxide ore deposits. Oxidation of sulfide deposits occurs during the <b>geological</b> <b>process</b> called weathering. Therefore, oxide ore deposits are typically found close to the surface. If {{there are no other}} economic elements within the ore a mine might choose to extract the uranium using a leaching agent, usually a low molar sulfuric acid.|$|E

25|$|The geology of Saskatchewan can {{be divided}} into two main {{geological}} regions, the Pre-Cambrian or Canadian shield and the Phanerozoic or Western Canada Sedimentary Basin. Within the Canadian shield exists the Athabasca sedimentary basin. Meteorite impacts have altered the natural geological formation processes. The Quaternary period is the most recent <b>geological</b> <b>process</b> when the prairies were affected by glacial events. There are six notable meteorite or comet impact craters in Saskatchewan. Carswell, Deep Bay and Gow Lake have affected the Canadian Shield area of the north. In the southern Phanerozoic crater are the Viewfield, Elbow and Maple Creek structures.|$|E
25|$|Impact {{cratering}} is {{the most}} notable <b>geological</b> <b>process</b> on the Moon. The craters are formed when a solid body, such as an asteroid or comet, collides with the surface at a high velocity (mean impact velocities for the Moon are about 17km per second). The kinetic energy of the impact creates a compression shock wave that radiates away {{from the point of}} entry. This is succeeded by a rarefaction wave, which is responsible for propelling most of the ejecta out of the crater. Finally there is a hydrodynamic rebound of the floor that can create a central peak.|$|E
25|$|Tectonic {{activity}} {{along the}} North Coast of British Columbia and Southeast Alaska {{is characterized by}} transform movements of the Queen Charlotte Fault, a plate boundary where the Pacific Plate skids by the North American Plate. As the Pacific Plate moves northward to the Aleutian subduction zone, it generates rifting in the North American continent. Magma rises along cracks created by the rifting, and eventually erupts on the surface to form a volcano. This <b>geological</b> <b>process</b> has, over time, created the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, {{which is the most}} volcanically active area in Canada. However, most of the volcanoes have not been directly dated or have not been dated in sufficient detail to recognize how active they are, making the prediction of volcanic events difficult and volcanic hazards uncertain.|$|E

40|$|In all the Indian legends, {{whether it}} is the Ramayana or Mahabharata, one can find {{embedded}} elements of <b>geological</b> <b>processes.</b> Perhaps {{due to the lack of}} a sound scientific basis for recognizing <b>geological</b> <b>processes</b> in ancient Indian civilization, such processes were believed to be the acts of 'Gods' (Suras) and 'Demons' (Asuras) and hence they formed an integral part of these legends. Even in the present age where science is able to explain several <b>geological</b> <b>processes,</b> the Hindu faith is such that these myths and legends continue to be passed on to succeeding generations. The fact that these <b>geological</b> <b>processes</b> are contained in these epics helps to sustain truth (dharma) and maintain harmony.

25|$|It was {{not until}} 1903–1905 that the Barringer Crater was {{correctly}} identified as an impact crater, and it {{was not until}} as recently as 1963 that research by Eugene Merle Shoemaker conclusively proved this hypothesis. The findings of late 20th-century space exploration and the work of scientists such as Shoemaker demonstrated that impact cratering was by far the most widespread <b>geological</b> <b>process</b> at work on the Solar System's solid bodies. Every surveyed solid body in the Solar System was found to be cratered, and {{there was no reason to}} believe that the Earth had somehow escaped bombardment from space. In the last few decades of the 20th century, a large number of highly modified impact craters began to be identified. The first direct observation of a major impact event occurred in 1994: the collision of the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter.|$|E

Strata deposition has drained a large magma chamber beneath the mountain. The Mojo islet was formed as part of the <b>geological</b> <b>process</b> in which Saleh Bay, collapsing into the caldera of the drained magma chamber, first appeared as a sea basin about 25,000 years ago.|$|E
500|$|Cadmium [...] {{makes up}} about 0.1mg kg−1 (ppm) of Earth's crust. [...] Compared {{with the more}} {{abundant}} 65ppm zinc, cadmium is rare. No significant deposits of cadmium-containing ores are known. Greenockite (CdS), the only cadmium mineral of importance, is nearly always associated with sphalerite (ZnS). This association is caused by geochemical similarity between zinc and cadmium, with no <b>geological</b> <b>process</b> likely to separate them. Thus, cadmium is produced mainly as a byproduct from mining, smelting, and refining sulfidic ores of zinc, and, to a lesser degree, lead and copper. Small amounts of cadmium, about 10% of consumption, are produced from secondary sources, mainly from dust generated by recycling iron and steel scrap. Production in the United States began in 1907, but not until after World War I did cadmium come into wide use.|$|E

A nuclear-power station was planned to be constructed in Closed Administrative Territorial Unit Seversk, which led to geotechnical investigation of the area to study the <b>geological</b> <b>processes</b> developing there. The investigation included reconnaissance traverse of the area, geological and geomorphic descriptions, and sampling. The area and percentage of the territory affected by the <b>geological</b> <b>processes</b> were estimated. As a result, it was proved that the <b>geological</b> <b>processes</b> of the area are conditioned by surface water activity leading to gullying and river erosion, and by both ground water and surface water activity resulting in bog formation. It appears that gullying is caused not only by natural factors but also by technogenic ones...|$|R
