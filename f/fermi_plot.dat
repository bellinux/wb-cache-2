40|$|The {{spectral}} {{distribution of the}} flux of positrons inside a beta radioactive medium was experimentally determined using an anthracene coincidence scintillation spectrometer. Positrons leaving a copper cavity source containing Cu/sup 64 / were absorbed in a thin anthracene crystal. The light pulse from the anthracene was recorded in a 256 channel analyzer if a NaI scintillation spectrometer nearby recorded simultaneously a count under the total absorption peak for annihilation radiation. Thus, discrimination against negative and secondary electrons was obtained which permitted observation of the primary positron slowing down flux. Data were corrected for the non-linear pulse height vs energy relationship in anthracene by a semi-empirical theory due to Birks, the validity of which was demonstrated by its use in obtaining a linear <b>Fermi</b> <b>plot</b> of Pm/sup 147 /. Positron spectra were corrected also for Compton absorption of the annihilation radiation in the anthracene. Results were compared with the theoretical continuous-slowing-down model. Over the energy range measured (20 [...] 650 kev) {{it was concluded that}} the continuous-slowing-down model gives the correct shape for the primary slowing-down spectrum. 43 references.

50|$|A Kurie plot (also {{known as}} a Fermi-Kurie plot) is a graph used in {{studying}} beta decay developed by Franz N. D. Kurie, in which the square root {{of the number of}} beta particles whose momenta (or energy) lie within a certain narrow range, divided by the <b>Fermi</b> function, is <b>plotted</b> against beta-particle energy. It is a straight line for allowed transitions and some forbidden transitions, in accord with the Fermi beta-decay theory. The energy-axis (x-axis) intercept of a Kurie plot corresponds to the maximum energy imparted to the electron/positron (the decay's -value). With a Kurie plot one can find the limit on the effective mass of a neutrino.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the electronic properties of antiferromagnetic UBi 2 metal by using ab initio calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT), employing the augmented plane waves plus local orbital method. We used the exact exchange for correlated electrons (EECE) method to calculate the exchange-correlation energy {{under a variety of}} hybrid functionals. Electric field gradients (EFGs) at the uranium site in UBi 2 compound were calculated and compared with the experiment. The EFGs were predicted experimentally at the U site to be very small in this compound. The EFG calculated by the EECE functional are in agreement with the experiment. The densities of states (DOSs) show that 5 f U orbital is hybrided with the other orbitals. The <b>plotted</b> <b>Fermi</b> surfaces show that {{there are two kinds of}} charges on Fermi surface of this compound...|$|R
40|$|Solid-state {{transport}} and electrochemical properties of Ti-doped hematite (α-(Ti_xFe_(1 -x)) _ 2 O_ 3 (001) epitaxial thin films (x = 0. 15, 0. 21, and 0. 42) were probed {{to achieve a}} better understanding of doped hematite for photoelectrochemical (PEC) applications. Room temperature resistivity measurements predict a resistivity minimum near x = 0. 25 Ti doping, which can be rationalized as maximizing charge compensating Fe^(2 +) concentration and Fe^(3 +) electron accepting percolation pathways simultaneously. Temperature dependent resistivity data are consistent with small polaron hopping, revealing an activation energy that is Ti concentration dependent and commensurate with previously reported values (≈ 0. 11 eV). In contact with inert electrolyte, linear Mott–Schottky data at various pH values indicate that there is predominantly a single donor for Ti-doped hematite at x = 0. 15 and x = 0. 42 Ti concentrations. Two slope Mott–Schottky data at pH extremes indicate the presence of a second donor or surface state in the x = 0. 21 Ti-doped film, with an energy level ≈ 0. 7 eV below the <b>Fermi</b> level. Mott–Schottky <b>plots</b> indicate pH and Ti concentration dependent flatband potentials of − 0. 2 to − 0. 9 V vs SHE, commensurate with previously reported data. Flatband potentials exhibited super-Nernstian pH dependence ranging from − 69. 1 to − 101. 0 mV/pH. Carrier concentration data indicate that the Fermi energy of the Ti-doped system is Ti concentration dependent, with a minimum of 0. 15 eV near x = 0. 25. These energy level data allow us to construct an energy band diagram for Ti-doped hematite electrode/electrolyte interfaces, and to determine a Ti-doping concentration that reduces bulk resistivity while also reducing the formation of surface states for these photoanodes...|$|R
40|$|Molecular doping {{is a key}} {{technique}} for realizing high efficient organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and photovoltaics (OPV). Furthermore, its most recent application in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) marks a milestone on the roadmap towards flexible organic CMOS technology. However, in contrast to silicon based devices, {{the understanding of the}} fundamental processes of molecular doping is still controversially discussed. This work aims at the detailed analysis of the molecular doping process by employing Photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) on various doped thin-films prepared by co-evaporation in vacuum. Here, the focus is on explanation of the experimental findings by a statistical description in order to contribute to the fundamental understanding of the doping mechanism. First, the Fermi level shifts in thin-films of the common hole transport materials MeO-TPD, ZnPc, and pentacene p-doped by the acceptors C 60 F 36 and F 6 -TCNNQ are studied. The precise control of molar doping ratios as low as 1 e− 5 is demonstrated, allowing analysis of the doping properties in a much broader range as previously accessible. Characteristic kinks and slopes in the Fermi level vs. doping concentration diagrams are found. Furthermore, the doping efficiency is found to decrease with increasing doping concentrations to just a few percent at molar ratios above 0. 1. By numerically solving the charge neutrality equation using a classical semiconductor physics approach, these findings are explained by trap-limitation, dopant saturation, and reserve regimes as known from inorganic semiconductor physics. Using the example of p-doped MeO-TPD thin-films, it is finally demonstrated that the density of deep gap states depends on the purity degree of the host material. Similar studies are conducted on thin-films of C 60, ZnPc, and pentacene n-doped by the di-metal complex W 2 (hpp) 4. The corresponding <b>Fermi</b> level <b>plots</b> possess also host material specific kinks and slopes, which however, can be explained by application of the statistical doping description and assuming just dopant saturation and trap-limitation. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that electron traps with defined density can intentionally be introduced in pentacene by co-evaporation of C 60 and gradually filled-up by n-doping with W 2 (hpp) 4. In contrast to p-dopants, the highly efficient n-dopant W 2 (hpp) 4 is prone to degradation in air due to its low IP of just 2. 4 eV. Therefore, the degradation of pure films of W 2 (hpp) 4 as well as of n-doped films applying various host materials is studied under air exposure by conductivity measurements and PES. An unexpected (partial) passivation of W 2 (hpp) 4 molecules against oxidation is found, however, this effect is identified to depend on the energy levels of the used host material. This finding is explained by a down-shift of the W 2 (hpp) 4 energy levels upon charge transfer to a host material with deeper lying energy levels and thus allows for new conclusions on the relative alignment of the energy levels of dopant and host molecules in doped films in general. The maximum open-circuit voltage Voc of BHJ solar cells is limited by the effective HOMO(donor) -LUMO(acceptor) gap of the photo-active absorber blend. Therefore, the relative energy levels within ZnPc:C 60 blend layers are furthermore investigated by PES, identifying an increase of the HOMO(ZnPc) -LUMO(C 60) gap by 0. 25 eV when varying the blend stoichiometry from 6 : 1 to 1 : 6. The trend in this gap correlates with observed changes in Voc of respective BHJ solar cells as well as with measured charge transfer energies. As physical origins for the changed energy levels, a suppressed crystallization of the C 60 phase due to presence of donor molecules as well as concentration-dependent growth modes of the ZnPc phase are discussed...|$|R
