40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose {{foundations}} for a theory of errors in teamwork based upon analysis of a case study of fratricide alongside a review of the existing literature. This approach may help to promote a better understanding of interactions within complex systems and help in the formulation of hypotheses and predictions concerning errors in teamwork, particularly incidents of fratricide. It is proposed that a <b>fusion</b> of concepts <b>drawn</b> from error models, with common causal categories taken from teamwork models, could allow for an in-depth exploration of incidents of fratricide. It is argued that such a model has the potential to explore the core causal categories identified as present in an incident of fratricide. This view marks fratricide as a process of errors occurring throughout the military system as a whole, particularly due to problems in teamwork within this complex system. Implications of this viewpoint for the development of a new theory of fratricide are offered. <br/...|$|R

She purchased a portable sewing machine, and “began to learn to draw with it, at first simply, then with greater complexity, making contemporary drawings that were enriched and transformed by the process of their creation. From the outset, I somehow knew that this was what I was going to do {{for the rest of my}} life and that the potential was enormous. I wanted to make the sewing machine an extension of my nervous system.” [...] Marks thus broke with her earlier processes and expressed her aesthetic through fabric and the properties of sewing. Though her work had previously explored realms of the fantastic, the colors, textures and imagery in fabric, and the tonal, tactile, and linear properties of stitching provided Marks with an expanded repertoire of elements with which to actualize her ideas. Marks calls these works ″sewn drawings.″ Though she had no previous knowledge of the complexities of a sewing machine, Marks’ expertise with power tools, skills she acquired as a sculptor, served as the basis to understand the mechanics of machine sewing. Nevertheless, mastering the sewing machine and being able to draw with it was an intense learning process that moved from a combination of hand and machine embroidery through achieving the dexterity to draw on the machine.|$|R

Recently, <b>drawing</b> upon this experience, negative halogen ions have been proposed {{as an alternative to}} positive ions for heavy ion fusion drivers in inertial confinement fusion, because electron accumulation would be prevented in negative ion beams, and if desired, the beams could be photo-detached to neutrals. This paper reports the results of an experiment comparing the current density and beam emittance of Cl+ and Cl- extracted from substantially ion-ion plasmas with that of Ar+ extracted from an ordinary electron-ion plasma, all using the same source, extractor, and emittance scanner. At similar discharge conditions, the Cl- current was typically 85 – 90 % of the positive chlorine current, with an e-/ Cl- ratio as low as seven without grid magnets. The Cl- was as much as 76 % of the Ar+ current from a discharge with the same RF drive. The minimum normalized beam emittance and inferred ion temperatures of Cl+, Cl-, and Ar+ were all similar, so the current density and optical quality of Cl- appear as suitable for heavy ion fusion driver applications as a positive noble gas ion of similar mass. Since F, I, and Br should all behave similarly in an ion source, they should also be suitable as driver beams...|$|R

40|$|This paper reviews recent {{results in}} {{audiovisual}} fusion and discusses main {{challenges in the}} area {{with a focus on}} desynchronization of the two modalities and the issue of training and testing where one of the modalities might be absent from testing. By Aggelos K. Katsaggelos, Fellow IEEE, Sara Bahaadini, and Rafael Molina ABSTRACT | In this paper, we review recent results on audio-visual (AV) fusion. We also discuss some of the challenges and report on approaches to address them. One important issue in AV fusion is how the modalities interact and influence each other. This review will address this question in the context of AV speech processing, and especially speech recognition, where one of the issues is that the modalities both interact but also sometimes appear to desynchronize from each other. An additional issue that sometimes arises {{is that one of the}} modalities may be missing at test time, although it is available at training time; for example, it may be possible to collect AV training data while only having access to audio at test time. We will review approaches to address this issue from the area of multiview learning, where the goal is to learn a model or re-presentation for each of the modalities separately while taking advantage of the rich multimodal training data. In addition to multiview learning, we also discuss the recent application of deep learning (DL) toward AV <b>fusion.</b> We finally <b>draw</b> con-clusions and offer our assessment of the future in the area of AV fusion...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{approaches}} the contemporary horror film {{from a number}} of directions. Firstly, it is considered in relation to the historical roots of horror fiction, the tradition of the literary Gothic which stretches back as far as the late eighteenth century. The same chapter elaborates the broad outline of a methodology, drawing upon an established body of genre theory in both literary and film studies, which is then applied to the gradual diffusion of the Gothic legacy into the related genres of detective stories/thrillers, horror, and science-fiction, the inter-relatedness of these three genres forming part of the cultural context for modern horror. Chapter 3 considers Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960) in relation to the structures and iconography of the original Gothic, and in the light of its <b>fusion</b> of conventions <b>drawn</b> from the horror film and the thriller. Chapter 4 compares this film with a similarly influential movie - Halloween - made almost two decades later, assessing some of the changes which the genre has undergone in the intervening period. The following five chapters (5 - 9) discuss a number of films of the period 1968 - 80, paying particular attention to works that have figured prominently in the established critical literarure around the genre, both as an appraisal of existing approaches and as an indication of the immediate context for developments over the last decade. The remaining four chapters (10 - 13) consider some developments of the 1980 's, disputing the critical construction of the "body horror" category and providing an account of the horror-comedies which have generally been neglected by critics. The conclusion involves a synthesis of the material covered and a return to the Gothic tradition in order to conceptually situate the findings. There is an extensive biblography involving a variety of material ranging from popular magazines and newspapers to influential academic works, drawn more or less equally from the fields of literary criticism and film studies...|$|R
40|$|OBJECT: In this paper, the authors' {{goal was}} to {{evaluate}} the impact of PET data on the clinical management of incidental brain lesions in children. METHODS: Between 1995 and 2007, 442 children with a newly diagnosed brain lesion were referred to the authors' department. Of these, 55 presented with an incidental brain lesion and were selected for study because MR imaging sequences revealed limitations in assessing the tumor, its evolving nature, and/or the malignant potential of the lesion diagnosed. Thirteen children were studied using FDG-PET and 42 with L-(methyl-(11) C) -methionine (MET) -PET; 3 children underwent both FDG-PET and MET-PET but only the MET-PET results {{were used in the}} analysis. The PET and MR images were combined in image <b>fusion</b> navigation planning. <b>Drawing</b> on their experience with PET in adults, the authors proposed the following treatment plans: 1) surgery in children with imaging evidence of increased PET tracer uptake, which is highly specific of tumor and/or malignant tumor tissue; or 2) conservative treatment in children in whom there was little or no tracer uptake on PET. The authors compared the PET data with the MR imaging-based diagnosis and either 1) the results of histological examination in surgically treated cases, or 2) the long-term outcome in untreated cases. They studied PET and MR imaging sensitivity and specificity in detecting tumor and malignant tissues, and evaluated whether PET data altered their clinical management. RESULTS: Seventeen children had increased PET tracer uptake and underwent surgery. Tumor diagnosis was confirmed in all cases (that is, there were no false-positive findings). Cases in which there was little or no PET tracer uptake supported conservative treatment in 38 children. However, because PET was under evaluation, 16 of 38 lesions that were judged accessible for resection were surgically treated. Histological examination results demonstrated neither malignant nor evolving tumor tissue but yielded 9 indolent tumors (6 dysembryoplastic neuroectodermal tumors, 2 low-grade astrocytomas, and 1 low-grade astrocytoma and dysplasia) and 7 nontumoral lesions (3 cases of vasculitis, 3 of gliosis, and 1 of sarcoidosis). In 22 of the untreated 38 children, stable disease was noted during follow-up (range 18 - 136 months). Although an absence of PET tracer uptake might not exclude tumor tissue, PET did not reveal any false-negative findings in malignant or evolving tumor tissue detection in cases in which MR imaging showed false-positive and -negative cases in > 35 and 25 % of the cases, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirmed the high sensitivity and specificity of PET to detect tumor as well as malignant tissue. Regarding the treatment of the incidental brain lesions, the PET findings enabled the authors to make more appropriate decisions regarding treatment than those made on MR imaging findings alone. Therefore, the risk of surgically treating a nontumoral lesion was reduced as well as that for conservatively managing a malignant tumor. Nowadays, it is estimated that these data justify conservative management in incidental lesions with low or absent PET tracer uptake.
