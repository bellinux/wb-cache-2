5|$|Clinton {{voted against}} President Bush's two major tax cut packages, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. Clinton {{voted against the}} 2005 {{confirmation}} of John Roberts as Chief Justice of the United States and the 2006 confirmation of Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court, <b>filibustering</b> the latter.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 1849 and 1850, they contended with Narciso López, the Venezuelan radical who led {{repeated}} <b>filibustering</b> expeditions in {{an attempt}} to conquer the island of Cuba. The annexation of Cuba was the object of fascination among many in the South, who saw in Cuba a potential new slave state, and López had several prominent Southern supporters. López made generous offers to American military leaders to support him, but Taylor and Clayton saw the enterprise as illegal. They issued a blockade, and later, authorized a mass arrest of López and his fellows, although the group would eventually be acquitted. They also confronted Spain, which had arrested several Americans on the charge of piracy, but the Spaniards eventually surrendered them to maintain good relations with the U.S.|$|E

25|$|Senate Republicans {{successfully}} <b>filibustered</b> {{his nomination}} after a cloture vote failed 58-40 with one present and one not voting. This <b>filibuster</b> {{marked the first}} time a cabinet nominee was successfully <b>filibustered.</b>|$|R
5000|$|It {{goes to the}} Senate with {{a special}} rule: it can pass with 51 votes and cannot be <b>filibustered.</b> Other {{legislation}} can be <b>filibustered</b> and requires 60 votes to end the <b>filibuster.</b>|$|R
5|$|William Edward Forster {{argued that}} a Coercion Act—which would punish those participated in events like those at Lough Mask, and would include the {{suspension}} of Habeas Corpus—should be introduced before any Land Act. Gladstone eventually accepted this argument. When Forster attempted to introduce the Protection of Person and Property Act 1881, Parnell and other Land League MP's attempted to obstruct its passage with tactics such as <b>filibustering.</b> One such filibuster lasted for 41 hours. Eventually, the Speaker of the house intervened, and a measure was introduced whereby the Speaker could control the house {{if there was a}} three to one majority in favour of the business being urgent. This {{was the first time that}} a check was placed on a debate in a British parliament. The act was passed on 28 February 1881. There was a negative reaction to the passing of the act in both England and Ireland. In England, the Anti-Coercion Association was established, which was a precursor to the Labour Party.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{stood against}} this measure, {{as he had}} against nearly all Reconstruction laws. A lack of {{consensus}} delayed the bill from coming to a vote until the lame-duck session beginning in December 1874. By that time, disillusionment with the Grant administration and worsening economic conditions had translated into a Democratic victory in the mid-term elections. When the 44th Congress gathered in March 1875, the House would have a Democratic majority {{for the first time}} since the Civil War. In the meantime, the outgoing Republicans made one last effort to pass Sumner's civil rights bill; Randall and other Democrats immediately used parliamentary maneuvers to bring action to a stand-still, hoping to delay passage until the Congress ended. Randall led his caucus in <b>filibustering</b> the bill, at one point remaining on the floor for 72 hours. In the end, the Democrats peeled away some Republican votes, but not enough to defeat the bill, which passed by a vote of 162 to 100. Despite the defeat, Randall's filibuster increased his prominence in the eyes of his Democratic colleagues.|$|E

40|$|Cloture is {{the only}} {{means by which the}} Senate can vote to limit debate on a matter, and thereby {{overcome}} a possible <b>filibuster.</b> It would be erroneous, however, to assume that cases in which cloture is sought are the same as those in which a <b>filibuster</b> occurs. Cloture may be sought when no <b>filibuster</b> is taking place, and <b>filibusters</b> may occur without cloture being sought...|$|R
40|$|The <b>filibuster</b> in the United States Senate imposes an {{effective}} supermajority {{requirement for the}} enactment of most legislation because sixty votes are required to bring a measure to a vote over the objection of any senator. <b>Filibusters</b> are ubiquitous but virtually invisible, for the contemporary Senate practice {{does not require a}} senator to hold the floor to filibuster; senators <b>filibuster</b> simply by indication to the Senate leadership that they intend to do so. The prevalence and invisibility of this 2 ̆ 2 stealth <b>filibuster</b> 2 ̆ 2 dramatically affects which legislation is passed and which nominees are confirmed. The stealth <b>filibuster</b> also raises serious constitutional questions. Summarizing the historical development of Senate <b>filibusters,</b> Professors Fisk and Chemerinsky show that the nature and effects of <b>filibusters</b> have changed significantly as the Senate has grown larger and busier. They argue that, although dilatory debate has a history, the modern stealth <b>filibuster</b> is in significant respects unprecedented. Professors Chemerinsky and Fisk also asses the effects of the <b>filibuster</b> on Senate practice in light of empirical and public choice theories of congressional behavior. Based on this, they conclude that the <b>filibuster</b> is not alone among congressional proceedures in being anitmajoritan and that it may counteract the antimajoritan aspects of other congressional proceedures. Professors Fisk and Chemerinsky then discuss the constitutionality of the <b>filibuster.</b> They first conclude that a judicial challenge to the Senate rules that permit it would be justiciable if brought by the proper plaintiffs. They then conclude that, although the <b>filibuster</b> itself is not unconstititutional, the Senate rule that prohibits a majority of a newly elected Senate from abolishing the <b>filibuster</b> is unconstitutional because it impermissibly entrenches the decisions of past Congresses...|$|R
25|$|In May 2010, while {{favoring the}} <b>filibuster</b> and {{threatening}} {{to use it in}} 2009 to eliminate a public health option as part of the healthcare proposal, Lieberman once strongly opposed the <b>filibuster.</b> In 1995, he joined with Senator Tom Harkin to co-sponsor an amendment to kill the <b>filibuster.</b> “The <b>filibuster</b> hurts the credibility of the entire Senate and impedes progress,” Lieberman told the Hartford Courant (January 6, 1995).|$|R
25|$|In January 2012, Conservative and Scottish National Party MPs used <b>filibustering</b> to {{successfully}} block the Daylight Savings Bill 2010–12, a Private Member's Bill {{that would put}} the UK on Central European Time. The <b>filibustering</b> included an attempt by Jacob Rees-Mogg to amend the bill to give the county of Somerset its own time zone, 15 minutes behind London.|$|E
25|$|Although {{they were}} illegal, <b>filibustering</b> {{operations}} in the late 1840s and early 1850s were romanticized in the United States. The Democratic Party's national platform included a plank that specifically endorsed William Walker's <b>filibustering</b> in Nicaragua. Wealthy American expansionists financed dozens of expeditions, usually based out of New Orleans, New York, and San Francisco. The primary target of manifest destiny's filibusters was Latin America but there were isolated incidents elsewhere. Mexico was a favorite target of organizations devoted to <b>filibustering,</b> like the Knights of the Golden Circle. William Walker got his start as a filibuster in an ill-advised attempt to separate the Mexican states Sonora and Baja California. Narciso López, a near second in fame and success, spent his efforts trying to secure Cuba from the Spanish Empire.|$|E
25|$|In Italy, <b>filibustering</b> has ancient {{traditions and}} is {{expressed}} overall with the proposition of legal texts on which interventions take place.|$|E
50|$|The removal or {{substantial}} {{limitation of}} the <b>filibuster</b> is called the constitutional option by proponents, and the nuclear option by opponents. Under current Senate rules, a rule change itself could be <b>filibustered,</b> with two-thirds of those senators present and voting (as opposed to the normal three-fifths of those sworn) needing to vote to break the <b>filibuster.</b> Even if a <b>filibuster</b> attempt is unsuccessful, the process takes floor time.|$|R
50|$|The <b>filibuster</b> is {{a tactic}} used to defeat bills and motions by prolonging debate indefinitely. A <b>filibuster</b> may entail long speeches, dilatory motions, and an {{extensive}} series of proposed amendments. The Senate may end a <b>filibuster</b> by invoking cloture. In most cases, cloture requires {{the support of}} three-fifths of the Senate; however, if the matter before the Senate involves changing {{the rules of the}} body - this includes amending provisions regarding the <b>filibuster</b> - a two-thirds majority is required. In current practice, the threat of <b>filibuster</b> is more important than its use; almost any motion that does not have the support of three-fifths of the Senate effectively fails. This means that 41 senators can make a <b>filibuster</b> happen. Historically, cloture has rarely been invoked because bipartisan support is usually necessary to obtain the required supermajority, so a bill that already has bipartisan support is rarely subject to threats of <b>filibuster.</b> However, motions for cloture have increased significantly in recent years.|$|R
50|$|Numerous {{judicial}} nominees prior to Estrada {{had been kept}} off the courts, when the Senate refused to let the nomination out of committee for a floor vote. A <b>filibuster</b> {{had been used in}} 1968 to extend debate regarding the elevation of Associate Justice Abe Fortas to Chief Justice of the United States, but the Estrada <b>filibuster</b> was different in multiple ways. Estrada's was the first <b>filibuster</b> ever to be successfully used against a judicial nominee who had clear support of the majority in the Senate. Estrada's was the first <b>filibuster</b> of any court of appeals nominee. It was also the first <b>filibuster</b> that prevented a judicial nominee from joining a court.|$|R
25|$|On July 3, 1998, Labour MP Michael Foster's Wild Mammals (Hunting with Dogs) Bill {{was blocked}} in {{parliament}} by opposition <b>filibustering.</b>|$|E
25|$|Albert Leung Sze-ho, an {{independent}} candidate submitted his nomination form on 16 January 2016, vowed {{to modify the}} rules of procedure in order to block pan-democrats' <b>filibustering.</b>|$|E

50|$|In July 2016, a Senate {{version of}} the law (S.2193) was passed 55-42, mostly by Senate Republicans, but was <b>filibustered</b> with no supermajority to defeat the <b>filibuster.</b> The Senate also voted on another bill often {{confused}} with Kate's Law, the Stop Dangerous Sanctuary Cities Act (S.3100). The bill passed 53-44 but was <b>filibustered.</b>|$|R
40|$|Since Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid {{used the}} {{so-called}} “nuclear option” to essentially end the <b>filibuster</b> on most presidential nominations on Thursday, {{there has been}} considerable speculation {{over the future of}} the <b>filibuster</b> on legislation. Joshua Huder argues that the <b>filibuster,</b> when used correctly, can foster bipartisanship and calls for it to be reformed rather than eliminated. He goes on to give specific recommendations on how to adjust the <b>filibuster</b> so it can once again incentivize the parties to work together...|$|R
5000|$|He {{also holds}} {{the record for}} the second and eighth longest <b>filibusters</b> ever {{recorded}} in the United States Senate. He is remembered for his unique and rather comical <b>filibusters.</b> In 1986, in a <b>filibuster</b> against a military bill lasted 23 h 30 min, he was known for reading the District of Columbia phone book. In 1992, D'Amato <b>filibustered</b> {{a bill that would have}} caused the loss of 750 jobs in upstate New York by singing [...] "South of the Border (Down Mexico Way)".|$|R
25|$|In opposition, Tony Abbott's Liberal National {{coalition}} used {{suspension of}} standing orders in 2012 {{for the purposes}} of <b>filibustering,</b> most commonly during question time against the Labor government.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{in the era}} of Manifest Destiny, his <b>filibustering</b> {{project was}} popular in the {{southern}} and western United States and the jury took eight minutes to acquit him.|$|E
25|$|A {{dramatic}} {{example of}} <b>filibustering</b> in the House of Commons of Canada {{took place between}} Thursday June 23, 2011 and Saturday June 25, 2011. In an attempt to prevent the passing of Bill C-6, which would have legislated the imposing of a four-year contract and pay conditions on the locked out Canada Post workers, the New Democratic Party (NDP) led a <b>filibustering</b> session which lasted for fifty-eight hours. The NDP argued that the legislation in its then form undermined collective bargaining. Specifically, the NDP opposed the salary provisions and the form of binding arbitration outlined in the bill.|$|E
5000|$|Out of 47 Maryland Senators, 21 {{signed on}} to a <b>filibuster</b> against the [...] "Smart Gun" [...] legislation. At that time, it took 16 Senators to sustain a <b>filibuster.</b> When the Democrat {{majority}} had the [...] "Smart Gun" [...] bill removed from the committee where Ferguson had it bottled up, and where it would have died, the bill hit {{the floor of the}} Senate where it was immediately amended into a [...] "Child Safety-Lock Handgun" [...] bill and all the [...] "Smart Gun" [...] provisions were deleted. At that point, 7 of the Senators who previously promised a <b>filibuster</b> changed their mind, leaving 14 Senators (including Ferguson) ready to <b>filibuster</b> - two votes shy to sustain a <b>filibuster.</b>|$|R
50|$|King {{supports}} {{reform of}} the Senate <b>filibuster,</b> noting that senators are no longer required {{to stand on the}} floor and speak during a <b>filibuster.</b> He also points out that the Constitution contains no 60-vote requirement to conduct business in the Senate. Accordingly, in 2013 King voted in favor of the so-called nuclear option to eliminate the <b>filibuster</b> for most presidential nominees.|$|R

25|$|<b>Filibustering</b> {{continued}} to be a major concern for presidents after Polk. Whigs presidents Zachary Taylor and Millard Fillmore tried to suppress the expeditions. When the Democrats recaptured the White House in 1852 with the election of Franklin Pierce, a <b>filibustering</b> effort by John A. Quitman to acquire Cuba received the tentative support of the president. Pierce backed off, however, and instead renewed the offer to buy the island, this time for $130million. When the public learned of the Ostend Manifesto in 1854, which argued that the United States could seize Cuba by force if Spain refused to sell, this effectively killed the effort to acquire the island. The public now linked expansion with slavery; if manifest destiny had once enjoyed widespread popular approval, this was no longer true.|$|E
25|$|In January 2000, <b>filibustering</b> {{directed}} by Conservative MPs {{to oppose the}} Disqualifications Bill led to cancellation of the day's parliamentary business on Prime Minister Tony Blair's 1000th day in office. However, since this business included Prime Minister's Questions, William Hague, Conservative leader at that time, was deprived of the opportunity of a high-profile confrontation with the Prime Minister.|$|E
25|$|As {{a direct}} result of the deal, the two <b>filibustered</b> nominees not {{mentioned}} in it (David W. McKeague and Richard Allen Griffin) were confirmed. Despite these agreements, however, some observers noted that the chances were still high that the Democrats would <b>filibuster</b> any of the ten originally <b>filibustered</b> nominees if he or she were later nominated to the Supreme Court, especially Owen, Pryor or Brown.|$|R
5000|$|On June 24, 2015, Murphy stated that: [...] "Since Sandy Hook {{there has}} been a school shooting, on average, every week"; The Washington Post {{described}} this statement as misleading. On June 15-16, 2016, Murphy staged a <b>filibuster</b> regarding gun control following the deadliest mass shooting in US history in Orlando, Florida. The <b>filibuster</b> entered the list of the top 10 longest <b>filibusters</b> in US history.|$|R
2500|$|Under current Senate rules, any {{modification}} or {{limitation of}} the <b>filibuster</b> would be a rule change that itself could be <b>filibustered,</b> with two-thirds of those senators present and voting (as opposed to the normal three-fifths of those sworn) needing to vote to break the <b>filibuster.</b> [...] However, under Senate precedents, a simple majority can (and has) acted to limit the practice by overruling decisions of the chair. [...] The removal or substantial {{limitation of the}} <b>filibuster</b> by a simple majority, rather than a rule change, is called the constitutional option by proponents, and the nuclear option by opponents.|$|R
