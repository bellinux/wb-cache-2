500|$|Widmerpool's chief {{characteristic}} in {{his youth}} is an exaggerated respect for and deference to authority. This is first indicated by his obsequious response to being hit in the face by a banana, thrown by the school's cricket captain. It is further shown by his outrage over a prank played by his schoolfellow Charles Stringham on their housemaster, Le Bas. [...] He has a craving for acceptance, even {{at the price of}} humiliation, and has a natural talent for aligning himself with the dominant power. Many of Widmerpool's traits are evident quite early in his career: his pomposity, his aversion to all forms of culture ("the embodiment of thick-skinned, self-important philistinism" [...] according to one commentator), his bureaucratic obsessions and his snobbishness. He is politically naïve and his contribution to the pre-war appeasement of Nazi Germany <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that Hermann Göring be awarded the Order of the Garter and given a tour of Buckingham Palace. Yet, as the novel sequence progresses, Widmerpool emerges as [...] far less of a buffoon and becomes, against all expectations, powerful and power-obsessed. In his analysis of Powell's fiction, Nicholas Birns identifies an incident in The Acceptance World (the third volume of the series) as {{the point at which the}} assessment of Widmerpool by his contemporaries begins to change. Widmerpool takes charge of a drunken Stringham after a reunion dinner, guides him home and despite resistance puts him firmly to bed: [...] "Widmerpool, once so derided by all of us, had in some mysterious manner become a person of authority. Now, in a sense, it was he that derided us".|$|E

The use of the {{adjective}} [...] "total" [...] <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> {{that it is a}} special case of a partial function (specifically, a total function with domain X is a special case of a partial function over X). [...] The adjective will typically be used for clarity in contexts where partial functions are common, for example in computability theory.|$|E
2500|$|Melville's style, in Nathalia Wright's analysis, {{seamlessly}} flows {{over into}} theme, because all these borrowings have an artistic purpose, which <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> an appearance [...] "larger and {{more significant than}} life" [...] for characters and themes that are in fact unremarkable. The allusions suggest that beyond the world of appearances another world exists, one that influences this world, and where ultimate truth can be found. Moreover, the ancient background thus suggested for Melville's narratives– ancient allusions being next in number to the Biblical ones– invests them {{with a sense of}} timelessness.|$|E
2500|$|Numbers {{are very}} often {{obtained}} {{as the result}} of a measurement. As measurements are generally afflicted with some measurement error with a known upper bound, the result of a measurement is well represented by a decimal with [...] digits after the decimal mark, as soon as the absolut measurement error is bounded from above by 10-n. In practice, measurement results are often given with a certain number of digits after the decimal point, which indicate the error bounds. For example, although 0.080 and 0.08 denote the same real number, the numeral 0.080 <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> a measurement with an error less than 0.001, while the numeral 0.08 indicates an absolute error bounded by 0.01. In both cases, the true value of the measured quantity could be, for example, 0.0803 or 0.0796 (see also significant figures).|$|E

2500|$|Gaitis {{scoffed at}} the notion that, in the {{interest}} of finality, parties must tolerate legal errors made by arbitrators.

2500|$|Delacroix {{had been}} greatly {{impressed}} by his fellow Parisien Théodore Géricault's The Raft of the Medusa, a painting for which he himself modeled as the young man at the front with the outstretched arm. The pyramidal arrangement that governs Géricault's painting is similarly seen with the figures in the foreground of The Massacre at Chios. On this unlikely layout of characters, Delacroix commented, [...] "One must fill up; if it is less natural, {{it will be more}} beautiful and fécond. Would that everything should hold together!" [...] The dense assembly of characters at the front is in marked contrast to the open and dispersed spaces behind them. Land and sea, light and shade run appear as bands of drifting colours listlessly running into each other, and Delacroix appears to abandon the laws of perspective altogether with his rendering of clouds. The complete effect of this background <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> a constant opening out, dissolution and centrelessness. Aesthetician Heinrich Wölfflin identified this technique, and classified it atectonic form.|$|E
2500|$|Direct readers' {{advisory}} {{is based}} on a non-judgmental assessment of the personal preferences of the reader through a series of questions, called a readers advisory conversation. [...] The assessment focuses on reader likes and dislikes with regard to a number of factors, including subject, reading level, genre, writing style, the level of characterization, plot elements, storyline, pace, tone, frame, and setting. [...] The hoped-for outcome of this interview is the identification of three or more appropriate suggestions (sometimes referred to as [...] "readalikes"—especially when the interview was initiated by patron interest in new authors/titles similar to one enjoyed in the past). [...] In identifying suitable suggestions, a readers' advisor combines personal knowledge of material with a variety of specialized print and online resources to come up with appropriate suggestions. The goal of direct readers advisory <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> titles based on a readers' individual interests and tastes. [...] Librarians who simply recommend their favorite books with little or no regard for the patron's own interests are not performing readers' advisory.|$|E

60|$|This book is {{a record}} of a {{pleasure}} trip. If it were a record of a solemn scientific expedition, it would have about it that gravity, that profundity, and that impressive incomprehensibility which are so proper to works of that kind, and withal so attractive.

6000|$|Now, {{my purpose}} in the earlier portion of this essay <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that certain {{phenomena}} of human nature, apparently as trivial as the sparks rubbed out of a deer's hide in a dark night, may indicate, and may be allied to a force or forces, which, like the Aurora Borealis, may shine {{from one end of}} the heavens to the other, strangely illumining the darkness of our destiny. Such phenomena science has ignored, as it so long ignored the sparks from the stroked deer-skin, and the attractive power of rubbed amber. These trivial things were not known to be allied to the lightning, or to indicate a force which man could tame and use. But just as the Indians, by a rapid careless inference, attributed the Aurora Borealis to electric influences, so (as anthropology assures us) savages everywhere have inferred the existence of soul or spirit, intelligence that ...|$|E
60|$|I am afraid, dear Edwin and Angelina, {{you expect}} too much from love. You think there is enough of your little hearts to feed this fierce, devouring passion for all your long lives. Ah, young folk! don't rely too much upon that {{unsteady}} flicker. It will dwindle and dwindle as the months roll on, {{and there is no}} replenishing the fuel. You will watch it die out in anger and disappointment. To each it will seem that it is the other who is growing colder. Edwin sees with bitterness that Angelina no longer runs to the gate to meet him, all smiles and blushes; and when he has a cough now she doesn't begin to cry and, putting her arms round his neck, say that she cannot live without him. The most she will probably do <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> a lozenge, and even that in a tone implying that it is the noise more than anything else she is anxious to get rid of.|$|E
60|$|The {{extent of}} my daring <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> one criterion, {{by which it}} may be rationally conjectured beforehand, whether or no a reader would lose his time, and perhaps his temper, in the perusal of this, or any other {{treatise}} constructed on similar principles. But it would be cruelly misinterpreted, as implying the least disrespect either for the moral or intellectual qualities of the individuals thereby precluded. The criterion is this: if a man receives as fundamental facts, and therefore of course indemonstrable and incapable of further analysis, the general notions of matter, spirit, soul, body, action, passiveness, time, space, cause and effect, consciousness, perception, memory and habit; if he feels his mind completely at rest concerning all these, and is satisfied, if only he can analyse all other notions into some {{one or more of}} these supposed elements with plausible subordination and apt arrangement: to such a mind I would as courteously as possible convey the hint, that for him the chapter was not written.|$|E

6000|$|HIS EXPERIMENTAL WORKS. Unless {{the student}} wants to {{encourage}} a sentimental mood by reading Hyperion, Longfellow's prose works need not detain us. Much more valuable and readable are his translations from various European languages, and of these his metrical version of The Divine Comedy of Dante is most notable. He attempted also several dramatic works, among which The Spanish Student (1843) is still readable, though not very convincing. In Christus: a Mystery he attempted a miracle play of three acts, dealing with Christianity in the apostolic, medieval and modern eras; but not even his admirers {{were satisfied with the}} result. [...] "The Golden Legend" [...] (one version of which Caxton printed on the first English press, and which a score of different poets have paraphrased) is the only part of Christus that may interest young readers by its romantic portrayal of the Middle Ages. To name such works <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> Longfellow's varied interests and his habit of experimenting with any subject or verse form that attracted him in foreign literatures.|$|E
60|$|The {{aim of this}} book, if it has one, <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> this thesis; {{that the}} very worst way of helping Anglo-American {{friendship}} {{is to be an}} Anglo-American. There is only one thing lower, of course, which is being an Anglo-Saxon. It is lower, because at least Englishmen do exist and Americans do exist; and it may be possible, though repulsive, to imagine an American and an Englishman in some way blended together. But if Angles and Saxons ever did exist, they are all fortunately dead now; and the wildest imagination cannot form the weakest idea of what sort of monster would be made by mixing one with the other. But my thesis is that the whole hope, and the only hope, lies not in mixing two things together, but rather in cutting them very sharply asunder. That is the only way in which two things can succeed sufficiently in getting outside each other to appreciate and admire each other. So long as they are different and yet supposed to be the same, there can be nothing but a divided mind and a staggering balance. It may be that in the first twilight of time man and woman walked about as one quadruped. But if they did, I am sure it was a quadruped that reared and bucked and kicked up its heels. Then the flaming sword of some angel divided them, and they fell in love with each other.|$|E
60|$|So far as Shaw {{has spread}} or helped a certain modern {{reluctance}} or mauvaise honte in these grand and grotesque functions of man I {{think he has}} definitely done harm. He has much influence among the young men; {{but it is not}} an influence in the direction of keeping them young. One cannot imagine him inspiring any of his followers to write a war-song or a drinking-song or a love-song, the three forms of human utterance which come next in nobility to a prayer. It may seem odd to say that the net effect of a man so apparently impudent will be to make men shy. But it is certainly the truth. Shyness is always the sign of a divided soul; a man is shy because he somehow thinks his position at once despicable and important. If he were without humility he would not care; and if he were without pride he would not care. Now the main purpose of Shaw's theoretic teaching is to declare that we ought to fulfil these great functions of life, that we ought to eat and drink and love. But the main tendency of his habitual criticism <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that all the sentiments, professions, and postures of these things are not only comic but even contemptibly comic, follies and almost frauds. The result would seem to be that a race of young men may arise who do all these things, but do them awkwardly. That which was of old a free and hilarious function becomes an important and embarrassing necessity. Let us endure all the pagan pleasures with a Christian patience. Let us eat, drink, and be serious.|$|E
