5|$|Overfishing is a {{major threat}} to edible fish such as cod and tuna. Overfishing {{eventually}} causes population (known as stock) collapse because the survivors cannot produce enough young to replace those removed. Such commercial extinction <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that the species is extinct, merely that it can no longer sustain a fishery.|$|E

5|$|Kitsune are {{believed}} to possess superior intelligence, long life, and magical powers. They are a type of yōkai, or spiritual entity, and the word kitsune is often translated as fox spirit. However, this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that kitsune are ghosts, nor that they are fundamentally different from regular foxes. Because the word spirit is used to reflect a state of knowledge or enlightenment, all long-lived foxes gain supernatural abilities.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} Charles was crowned as Charles XI <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> {{that he was}} the 11th king of Sweden who had the name Charles. His father's name (as the 10th) was due to his great-grandfather, King Charles IX of Sweden (1604–1611), having adopted his own numeral by using a mythological History of Sweden. This {{descendant}} was actually the 5th King Charles. The numbering tradition thus begun still continues, with the present king of Sweden being Carl XVI Gustaf.|$|E
5|$|The {{goal of the}} {{induction}} phase is to reach a complete remission. Complete remission <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> the disease has been cured; rather, it signifies no disease can be detected with available diagnostic methods. Complete remission is obtained in about 50%–75% of newly diagnosed adults, although this may vary based on the prognostic factors described above. The length of remission depends on the prognostic features of the original leukemia. In general, all remissions will fail without additional consolidation therapy.|$|E

The entire year of 1959 was neither an El Niño or a La Niña, {{but it had}} one Category5 hurricane (Patsy). Most of 1973 was during a La Niña, which reduces tropical cyclone activity in the eastern Pacific, yet Hurricane Ava, a Category 5 hurricane, formed in June of that year.|$|E

Much like Angel, she does not express her emotions and is called scary by Otonashi and Hinata. She cannot calm down without her earphone. She rarely talks, and she sometimes hurts others' feelings even though she <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> it.|$|E

She devastates Adam by first turning down his {{proposal}} of marriage, after he believes he is the father of the child, and then by leaving Manchester on a train. Adam arrives at the station shortly before her train leaves and pledges to love the child regardless of who its father is. Rachel demonstrates that he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> it, and the train departs for London.|$|E

5|$|In {{answering}} {{both questions}} in the negative, the Court of Appeal overturned the High Court's finding that the statute was unconstitutional. The Court of Appeal further clarified Singapore's stance on legislative plenary power and expounded upon Article 12(1) of the Constitution, explaining that the promise of equality <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that all persons are to be treated equally, but simply that all persons in like situations will be treated alike. Drawing on foreign case law, the Court of Appeal further outlined the test {{to determine if a}} differentiating law falls foul of Article 12.|$|E
5|$|In clitoridectomy, the {{clitoris}} may {{be removed}} {{as part of}} a radical vulvectomy to treat cancer such as vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia; however, modern treatments favor more conservative approaches, as invasive surgery can have psychosexual consequences. Clitoridectomy more often involves parts of the clitoris being partially or completely removed during FGM, which may be additionally known as female circumcision or female genital cutting (FGC). Removing the glans of the clitoris <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that the whole structure is lost, since the clitoris reaches deep into the genitals.|$|E
5|$|The Coronation {{class was}} {{probably}} painted in more styles of livery {{than any other}} engine class, seven in the LMS era up to 1947 and five more during the British Railways era from 1948 onwards. That <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that all 38 locomotives were painted in all these different styles; many were specific {{to just a few}} engines. The only style that all 38 bore was the British Railways lined Brunswick Green and the entire class was turned out thus beween 1955 and 1958.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of certain signs, termed red flags, indicate {{the need for}} further testing to look for more serious underlying problems, which may require immediate or specific treatment. The {{presence of}} a red flag <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that there is a significant problem. It is only suggestive, and most people with red flags have no serious underlying problem. If no red flags are present, performing diagnostic imaging or laboratory testing in the first four weeks after the start of the symptoms has not been shown to be useful.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Aquinas {{argued that}} {{statements}} about God are analogous to human experience. An analogous term is partly univocal (has only one meaning) and partly equivocal (has {{more than one}} potential meaning) because an analogy {{is in some ways}} the same and in some ways different from the subject. He proposed that those godly qualities which resemble human qualities are described analogously, with reference to human terms; for example, when God is described as good, it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that God is good in human terms, but that human goodness is used as a reference to describe God's goodness.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no stand-your-ground law, the fact that {{necessary}} defense (unlike utmost necessity) {{is not subject to}} subsidiarity means that there is also no duty to retreat. The mere fact that a defender uses a weapon against unarmed attacker <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that the defense is disproportionate (and thus not legitimate) to the manner of the attack and the proportionality of defense does not depend on the relative effectiveness of the defender's weapon compared to the intensity of the attack, but on {{the manner in which the}} weapon is used (aiming at leg, i.e. intended non-deadly defense, may be proportionate where aiming at chest may be manifestly disproportionate, notwithstanding if the slug hits a leg artery and the attacker bleeds to death).|$|E

5|$|Kant {{argued that}} {{rational}} beings {{can never be}} treated merely as means to ends; they must always also be treated as ends themselves, requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected. This derives from Kant's claim that reason motivates morality: it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings, including other people. A rational being cannot rationally consent to being used merely {{as a means to}} an end, so they must always be treated as an end. Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity: that which is rationally willed is morally right. Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never merely a means, it is morally obligatory that they are treated as such. This <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that we can never treat a human as a means to an end, but that when we do, we also treat him as an end in himself.|$|E
5|$|On April 27, 2016, Billboard {{reported}} that Five Finger Death Punch's record label Prospect Park had {{filed a lawsuit}} against the band on April 21, 2016 for breaching their contract. The basis of the claim cites that the band began working on a new album without Prospect Park's consent and will be working with Rise Records. In a recent interview, vocalist Ivan Moody has said he will be completing the current tour and leave the band at the end of 2017. The next day however, an announcement was published on the official site of FFDP, where it was revealed, that rumours about Ivan's departure are false. According to the announcement, the vocalist plans to start a side project beside Five Finger Death Punch, which <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> he has plans on leaving.|$|E
5|$|Some insects, {{occupying the}} {{biological}} niches that they do, {{need to be}} incredibly maneuverable. They must find their food in tight spaces and be capable of escaping larger predators – or they may themselves be predators, and need to capture prey. Their maneuverability, from an aerodynamic viewpoint, is provided by high lift and thrust forces. Typical insect fliers can attain lift forces up to three times their weight and horizontal thrust forces up to five times their weight. There are two substantially different insect flight mechanisms, and {{each has its own}} advantages and disadvantages – just because odonates have a more primitive flight mechanism <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> they are less able fliers; they are, in certain ways, more agile than anything that has evolved afterward.|$|E
