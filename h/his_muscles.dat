5|$|Nash has {{a medical}} {{condition}} called spondylolisthesis, which causes muscle tightness and back pain. Due to the condition, {{when he is not}} playing in basketball games, he lies on his back rather than sitting on the bench to keep <b>his</b> <b>muscles</b> from stiffening.|$|E
5|$|Drawing {{inspiration}} from the Mario series, Yoshizawa kept the same title but changed everything else; it became a platformer {{as opposed to a}} beat 'em up such as Double Dragon; the gameplay was modeled after Konami's Castlevania, with Ryu being equipped with a katana-like Dragon Sword, shurikens, and ninpo techniques such as fire wheels. In designing the protagonist Ryu Hayabusa, the development team wanted him to be unique from other ninjas. They designed him with a ninja vest in order to place emphasis on <b>his</b> <b>muscles,</b> and they furnished him with a cowl that arched outward. They originally wanted to equip Ryu with sensors and a helmet with an inside monitor to check his surroundings, but that idea was scrapped. According to Kato, they utilized specific locations and environments to justify the need for having a ninja for a main character.|$|E

25|$|Alonso has {{a tattoo}} of a samurai on his back. He {{revealed}} that the tattoo showed strength in <b>his</b> <b>muscles,</b> intelligence and force of will with inspiration from the Hagakure, the spiritual guide written by Yamamoto Tsunetomo in the 18th century. He currently lives in Dubai.|$|E
25|$|A {{subsequent}} autopsy recorded {{kidney failure}} {{as the cause}} of death. Hughes was in extremely poor physical condition {{at the time of his}} death. He suffered from malnutrition. While his kidneys were damaged, his other internal organs, including his brain, were deemed perfectly healthy. X-rays revealed five broken-off hypodermic needles in the flesh of his arms. To inject codeine into <b>his</b> <b>muscles,</b> Hughes had used glass syringes with metal needles that easily became detached.|$|E

25|$|In Bernini’s sculpture, you see Neptune {{towering over}} Triton. He {{appears to be}} a man in his early thirties, with a beard and wavy locks. Neptune has his legs spread apart and is {{balancing}} on a large seashell that carries both himself and Triton. Neptune only has a large sheet covering his right shoulder and gliding in between his legs, revealing parts of the male anatomy. The anatomy of the entire body is defined and the twisting of his torso gives him a more trimmed outline of <b>his</b> <b>muscles,</b> allowing the viewer to pay particular attention to <b>his</b> <b>muscles</b> and how they are contracted or relaxed in his state of movement. While standing, Neptune also holds a trident downward in motion that makes it look like he is about to thrust it at someone. “(H)e turns his angry look towards the water, which gushes forth at his feet, imposing his command by thrusting down with his trident.” His arms are tense, forcefully gripping it to dictate his divine power. There is an implication of wind in the long sheet and Neptune’s hair drift backwards, aiding the illusion of reality.|$|E
25|$|Wolverine's healing factor {{also affects}} {{a number of}} his {{physical}} attributes by increasing them to superhuman levels. His stamina is sufficiently heightened to the point he can exert himself for numerous hours, even after exposure to powerful tranquilizers. Wolverine's agility and reflexes are also enhanced to levels that are beyond the physical limits of the finest human athlete. Due to his healing factor's constant regenerative qualities, he can push <b>his</b> <b>muscles</b> beyond the limits of the human body without injury. This, coupled by the constant demand placed on <b>his</b> <b>muscles</b> by over one hundred pounds of adamantium, grants him some degree of superhuman strength. Since the presence of the adamantium negates the natural structural limits of his bones, he can lift or move weight that would otherwise damage a human skeleton. He has been depicted breaking steel chains, lifting several men above his head with one arm and throwing them through a wall, lifting Ursa Major (in grizzly bear form) over his head before tossing him across a room, and hauling a concert grand piano, and the platform it rests on, via a harness, while climbing a sheer cliff. Colossus and other allies use Wolverine's endurance and strength when throwing him at high speed in the Fastball Special.|$|E
25|$|Increasingly {{unable to}} control <b>his</b> <b>muscles,</b> Guthrie was hospitalized at Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital in Morris County, New Jersey, from 1956 to 1961, at Brooklyn State Hospital (now Kingsboro Psychiatric Center) in East Flatbush until 1966, and finally at Creedmoor Psychiatric Center in Queens Village, New York, {{until his death in}} 1967. Marjorie and the {{children}} visited Guthrie at Greystone every Sunday. They answered fan mail and played on the hospital grounds. Eventually a longtime fan of Guthrie invited the family to his nearby home for the Sunday visits. This lasted until Guthrie was moved to the Brooklyn State Hospital, which was closer to Howard Beach, NY, where Marjorie and the children then lived.|$|E

25|$|The formula enhances {{all of his}} {{metabolic}} {{functions and}} prevents the build-up of fatigue poisons in <b>his</b> <b>muscles,</b> giving him endurance far in excess of an ordinary human being. This accounts for many of his extraordinary feats, including bench pressing 1200 pounds (545kg) and running a mile (1.6km) in 73 seconds (49mph/78 kph, nearly twice the maximum speed achieved by the best human sprinters). Furthermore, his enhancements are the reason why {{he was able to}} survive being frozen in suspended animation for decades. He is highly resistant to hypnosis or gases that could limit his focus. The secrets of creating a super-soldier were lost with the death of its creator, Dr. Abraham Erskine. In the ensuing decades there have been numerous attempts to recreate Erskine's treatment, only to have them end in failure. Even worse, the attempts have instead often created psychopathic supervillains of which Captain America's 1950s imitator and Nuke are the most notorious examples.|$|E
25|$|The {{youngest}} of seven children, Smukler {{was born in}} Gloversville, New York, to Russian immigrants. His family moved to Newark, New Jersey, in 1918, where he played tackle at East Side High School in 1929 and 1930, earning all-State honors the second year. Still in his teens, he returned to Gloversville {{to live with his}} oldest brother Lewis and became his apprentice, learning to shear gloves from skins. Playing football at Gloversville High School, Smukler was taken out of the line by Coach Lawrence A. (Duke) Miller and made into a fullback. He had never kicked a football for any team before, but he spent hours by himself punting the ball. Smukler kept <b>his</b> <b>muscles</b> strong by walking five miles uphill after every practice. When the football season began, he was considered a “one-man team” and lost only one game. Besides excelling in football, Smukler was also a high-scoring guard on the basketball team {{and a member of the}} track team. In May 1932 he participated in the annual Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute interscholastic track meet in Troy, New York, and broke two state records, the 12-pound shot put and the discus throw.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} give Thanos [...] "the {{performance}} and the weight that he deserved", Luma Pictures created a new facial animation system to re-create Josh Brolin as a fully CG character, using his [...] "eyes, some of his cheek, how <b>his</b> <b>muscles</b> move when he talks". The character's large jaw, and the deep groves that run down his face, had [...] "to be carefully planned out with the movement of his face." ...|$|E
5000|$|Bulwark (Oswald Boeglin) - Bulwark {{could expand}} <b>his</b> <b>muscle</b> mass. He would {{reappear}} alongside Emplate, but was later captured {{and killed by}} the revamped Weapon X program. He was only a member during the team's first appearance.|$|R
5000|$|Diogu {{stands at}} 6 foot 9 inches (2.06 m) tall which is {{considered}} slightly undersized for an NBA power forward, but he makes up for his lack of height with <b>his</b> <b>muscle,</b> girth and 7'4" [...] wingspan.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know which}} to admire most, {{the man or}} <b>his</b> <b>muscle.</b> One doesn't often see such vigor, size and comeliness in these {{degenerate}} days," [...] said Randal, mentally booking the fine figure in the red shirt.|$|R
500|$|Mahesh {{agreed to}} be fit and healthy, since the film {{emphasised}} action scenes. He followed a 12-week Dynamic Transformation Plan (DTP) supervised by Kris Gethin, developing his abdominal muscles and losing weight. Mahesh then followed a Yoda Three Training regime (Y3T), supervised by Neil Hill, further developing <b>his</b> <b>muscles.</b> His stylist, Ashwin Malwe, said that his appearance and style would be [...] "sophisticated and classy" [...] in the film. Sukumar had Mahesh wear eyeglasses, since the director felt that audiences tended to consider a bespectacled character to be perfectionistic and positive, and the actor's hairstyle was changed.|$|E
500|$|Timoshenko {{was rushed}} to Kings County Hospital Center once medical {{personnel}} arrived at the scene. Each of the two bullets that struck Timoshenko cut across his spinal cord, just beneath his brain, which left him unable to breathe on his own or to move <b>his</b> <b>muscles.</b> [...] According to doctors, he had no oxygen for 15 to 20 minutes after he was shot because of his initial paralysis. The loss of oxygen left him in a coma since the shooting, so he was placed on life support machines {{that allowed him to}} breathe. Tests conducted on July 14 determined that he had no brain activity (matching the definition of legal death in the state of New York); as a result, the doctors pronounced him dead at 4:14 p.m. and turned off the artificial respirator. He was 23 {{years old at the time}} of his death.|$|E
500|$|A final {{alteration}} was to fit {{a simpler}} shutter (radiator vent) which had the object of warming the cockpit by directing heat from the engine. For McCudden this aspect was very important. At high altitude McCudden was to spend {{long periods of time}} in an extremely chilly environment. Operating the D.H.2 in 1916, he suffered terrible agonies as adequate blood circulation returned to <b>his</b> <b>muscles</b> once he reached [...] McCudden reported few general side-effects from high flight. Dizziness was a feature but he put this down to the cold rather than any form of anoxia. High altitude oxygen was too thin for humans which induced breathlessness. Aviation medicine was still in its infancy meaning pilots were left to solve operational problems themselves. Only the high-altitude bombers were equipped with oxygen equipment to assist with breathing. Despite his circulation difficulties, McCudden proved remarkably resistant to the effects of high altitude flying without oxygen.|$|E
50|$|Later, {{in broad}} daylight, Omar limps on a crutch to confront Michael's corner, visibly scaring them. He tells Michael to tell Marlo {{that he killed}} Savino, and that he'll take out all <b>his</b> <b>muscle</b> until Marlo comes at him himself.|$|R
5000|$|Crusher {{then comes}} {{charging}} back, but Bugs opens a safe door, letting Crusher run {{through it and}} bounce off the ring ropes before being slung back into the now closed door. A now disoriented Crusher is able to be pinned (literally, as Bugs puts a coat on Crusher, gets him to lie down and pins the coat's shoulders to the mat). When the match ends and Bugs is declared the new champion, Crusher snaps out of it. He offers his hand to shake Bugs' hand, despite the crowd's objections (Crusher merely growls them into silence). Bugs relents, but when Crusher tries to bite Bugs' arms he find he is instead biting through a stick of dynamite, which blows up in his face. Now finally done with Crusher, Bugs tries to flex <b>his</b> <b>muscle</b> ... but sees <b>his</b> <b>muscle</b> droop instead. Bugs simply accepts being weak, pushing <b>his</b> drooping <b>muscle</b> like a little swing.|$|R

500|$|The Vancouver {{branch of}} Sony Pictures Imageworks was {{responsible}} for the digital touch-up. The group improved the sewer and high school battle scene with many of Spider-Man's poses and environments that were used in the film. The comic book was cited as a basic source for Spider-Man's poses. The visual designers helped bring the Lizard to life by first building a digital version of a production design maquette. Many of the staff were involved with the process. They also started by thinking about lizard biology and how <b>his</b> <b>muscles</b> would work. A large man referred to as [...] "Big John" [...] stood in as the character during shooting, performing much of the interaction with other characters. The computer-generated Lizard replaced him in post-production. The creators would then fuse the design of the Lizard with the actor Rhys Ifans. Ifans then used motion capture for the Lizard's speaking parts, which Webb found challenging to incorporate into the character's final version.|$|E
500|$|Despite his unusual {{diet and}} {{behaviour}} {{in the presence}} of food, doctors described Domery as of a normal build, and tall for the period at [...] He had long, brown hair and grey eyes, was smooth-skinned, and was described as having a [...] "pleasant countenance". Doctors observing Domery saw no signs of mental illness and although illiterate, he was considered of normal intelligence by his crewmates and by the prison doctors who studied him. Despite eating vast amounts of food, it was noted by the doctors studying him that he never vomited, other than when fed large amounts of roasted or boiled meat. He showed no outward signs of ill health, and doctors observing him noted that his eyes were lively and his tongue clean. His pulse was regular at around 84BPM, and his body temperature normal. <b>His</b> <b>muscles</b> were normally formed, but observed by doctors to be weaker than usual, although during his time in the army he had marched 14French leagues (approximately 25mi/42km) in a day with no ill effects.|$|E
500|$|Later in the tournament, on 18 June 2012, Mario Balotelli scored {{his first}} goal {{in a major}} {{international}} tournament in a 2–0 victory against the Republic of Ireland. When he attempted to celebrate this goal, he was immediately halted by teammate Leonardo Bonucci, who covered Balotelli's mouth with his hand for fear that the striker would say something to [...] "get in trouble." [...] Balotelli had been dropped to the bench by Cesare Prandelli prior to the game due to his lack of ability shown in his previous group games, so when he was subbed on against Ireland fans didn't expect him to {{have much of an}} impact, and his celebration of his goal may have originally been directed towards the naysayers who believe he is bad for the team. Balotelli went on to start against England in the quarter-finals, his performance was described as wasteful but his effort was rated highly in a game where he missed multiple chances. He scored the first penalty taken in the shootout against his Manchester City teammate Joe Hart. On 28 June, Balotelli scored twice within the first 40 minutes in Italy's semi-final clash with Germany, as the Azzurri won 2–1 and progressed to the Euro 2012 final against European and World champions Spain. After scoring the second goal in that semi-final, he ripped off his shirt and stood motionless as he flexed <b>his</b> <b>muscles,</b> developing a famous celebration. Going into the final Balotelli said that, Manchester City's title success meant that failure in the Euros would not signal a personal failure this season. He also said that he was unfazed by the pressure he supposedly has on his shoulders going into the final, with new high expectations of him from his home supporters after his amazing performance against Germany.|$|E
2500|$|After these setbacks, Baldelli {{underwent}} extensive medical {{testing to}} determine the reasons for <b>his</b> <b>muscle</b> problems and worsening fatigue after even brief workouts.
