The proposed switch shares a {{small size of}} dedicated bu ers for its input and output ports, and <b>incoming</b> <b>cells</b> are e ectively distributed within the switch system. For sharing dedicated bu ers, a distributor {{is proposed}} to evenly distribute <b>incoming</b> <b>cells</b> into dedicated bu ers and an arbiter is also proposed to resolve the contentions of cells destined for the same output port. Since parallel processing techniques are applied to implementing the distributor and arbiter, the structure is simple and thus the processing is fast. Other features of the proposed switch architecture include scalability, no degradation in throughput with increasing the multicast cell ratio, and expandability to asymmetric switches.

M 1 stimulation by a defined media resulted in secretion of both pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines compared to M 2 stimulation.

Initially, somatic inner germarium sheath cells enter the empty niche, respond to Dpp, but fail to divide.

Preventive controls have a policing function, to protect the network from overload due to malice or malfunction on the user side of the interface, and a regulating function, to smooth the demand on network storage and bandwidth in the hope of improving network performance. We study the regulating function in simple ATM systems in which the transmission line buffers are depleted in FIFO (first in, first out) order. Our point of departure is the observation, formulated as a theorem, that regulation controls the location, rather than the amplitude, of network-induced impairments, moving cell losses from inside the network to the network boundary, but at the price of increased overall loss or delay. We display the tradeoff between interior and end-to-end blocking for the Leaky Bucket regulator applied to Poisson sources, showing how efficiency, measured in different ways, diminishes with the number of sources. We examine the interplay between cell loss rate and worst case delay, again for Poisson sources, and assuming that the Leaky Bucket has been optimized for one of the two criteria, subject to a constraint on the other.

Indeed, the mismatch between the rounded shapes of cells and the angular cross-section of standard microfluidic channels hampers efficient obstruction of the channel by an <b>incoming</b> <b>cell.</b> Moreover, friction forces between a cell and channels walls have never been characterized. Both effects impede a quantitative determination of forces experienced by cells in a constriction. Our study is based on a new microfluidic device composed of two successive constrictions, combined with optical interference microscopy measurement to characterize the contact zone between the cell and the walls of the channel. A cell squeezed in a first constriction obstructs most of the channel cross-section, which strongly limits leaks around cells. The rheological properties of the cell are subsequently probed during its entry in a second narrower constriction. The pressure force is determined from the pressure drop across the device, the cell velocity and the width of the gutters formed between the cell and the corners of the channel. The additional friction force, which has never been analyzed for moving and constrained cells before, is found to involve both hydrodynamic lubrication and surface forces. This friction results in the existence of a threshold for moving the cells and lead to a non-linear behavior at low velocity. The friction force can nevertheless be assessed in the linear regime. Finally, an apparent viscosity of single cells can be estimated from a numerical prediction of the viscous dissipation induced by a small step in the channel.

This buffer sharing scheme improves {{the performance of the}} input buffer ATM switch in terms of the cell loss ratio and the CDV by equalizing the occupancy of input buffers. In order to make the equalizing and buffer sharing operation fast and simple, the proposed buffer sharing scheme uses a dynamic threshold by which input buffers are separated into two groups according to their occupancy. The buffer sharing scheme equalizes the buffer occupancy of input buffers by distributing <b>incoming</b> <b>cells</b> to the input buffers of lower occupancy first. The performance of the proposed buffer sharing scheme is evaluated by computer simulation.

[...] The IC temporarily stores the <b>incoming</b> <b>cells</b> in input buffers, performs routing table lookup, and forwards them to the switch fabric that delivers cells to outgoing lines. A cache-based IC architecture improves the efficiency by locally storing the frequently used forwarding information. We realize this purpose by high-speed cache attempts followed by slower routing table lookups, if necessary. [...] We have developed a simulator to evaluate different schemes to construct the IC. The simulator has the capability of generating traffic following uniform random traffic (URT) and bursty traffic models. Simulation results show that the IC system works well and the system performance can be improved as cache hits occur most of the time. [...] Encouraged by the good performance shown, we have developed the hardware implementation for the proposed IC system using Very High Speed Hardware Description Language (VHDL). This is simulated and synthesized using design tools supplied by Model Technology and Synopsys...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} a hierarchical CAM architecture for fast VPI/VCI translation, {{taking into account}} the temporal correlation among <b>incoming</b> ATM <b>cells.</b> To dynamically control the order of memory access, caches are integrated into the CAM to sort the addresses of memory array. In this way, power-hungry operations involving actual data swapping are avoided. Four cache memory updating/sorting policies have also been proposed: adjacency and exponential swapping with or without delayed flags. In total, four 32 Kb CAM engines with different cache options have been synthesized and examined. Simulation results show that exponential swapping tends to substantially reduce the number of searches, leading to much lower search time and power consumption. Furthermore, performance of the cache policies can be considerably improved by integrating a delayed swapping flag into the cache...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-In this paper, a new ATM switch {{architecture}} is presented. Our proposed Mtdtinet switch is a self-routing multistage switch with partially shared internal buffers capable of achieving 100 % throughput under uniform traffic. Although it provides <b>incoming</b> ATM <b>cells</b> with multiple paths, the cell sequence is maintained throughout the switch fabric thus eliminating the out-of-order cell sequence problem. Cells contending {{for the same}} output addresses are buffered internally according to a partially shared queueing discipline. In a partially shared queueing scheme, buffers are partially shared to accommodate bursty traffic and to limit tbe performance degradation that may occur in a completely shared system where {{a small number of}} calls may hog the entire buffer space unfairly. Although the hardware complexity in terms of number of crosspoints {{is similar to that of}} input queueing switches, the Mtdtinet switch has throughpu...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{intrinsic}} {{neural networks}} of the gastrointestinal tract {{are derived from}} dedicated neural crest progenitors that colonize the gut during embryogenesis and give rise to enteric neurons and glia. Here, we study how an essential subpopulation of enteric glial cells (EGCs) residing within the intestinal mucosa is integrated into the dynamic microenvironment of the alimentary tract. We find that under normal conditions colonization of the lamina propria by glial cells commences during early postnatal stages but reaches steady-state levels after weaning. By employing genetic lineage tracing, we provide evidence that in adult mice the network of mucosal EGCs is continuously renewed by <b>incoming</b> glial <b>cells</b> originating in the plexi of the gut wall. Finally, we demonstrate that both the initial colonization and homeostasis of glial cells in the intestinal mucosa are regulated by the indigenous gut microbiota...|$|R
