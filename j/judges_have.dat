Cahill Jr., who was {{appointed by}} Jimmy Carter in 1980. No Hispanic or Asian <b>judges</b> <b>have</b> served on this court. Over {{the history of the}} District, five of its <b>judges</b> <b>have</b> been elevated to the Eighth Circuit - Elmer Bragg Adams, John Caskie Collet, Charles Breckenridge Faris, Amos Madden Thayer and William Hedgcock Webster. No judge from this district has served on the United States Supreme Court.|$|E

5|$|Qadis {{generally}} have degrees in Sharia law from an Islamic university {{recognized by the}} Saudi government with, in many cases, a post-graduate qualification from the Institute of Higher Judiciary in Riyadh. The training received from such Sharia law degrees is entirely religious in character {{and is based on}} the Qur'an and centuries old religious treatises with no reference to, for example, modern commercial issues. Although most <b>judges</b> <b>have</b> been educated and appointed under the current system, some of the older judges received the traditional qadi's training of years of instruction by a religious mentor in a mosque.|$|E

5|$|The {{capabilities}} and reactionary {{nature of the}} <b>judges</b> <b>have</b> been criticized. The main complaint reportedly made by Saudis privately is that judges, who have wide discretion in interpreting the Sharia, have no knowledge, and are often contemptuous, of the modern world. Reported examples of judges' attitudes include rulings banning {{such things as the}} children’s game Pokémon, telephones that play recorded music, and sending flowers to hospital patients. Saudi judges come from a narrow recruitment pool. By one estimate, 80% of the 600+ Saudi judges and almost all senior judges come from Qasim, a province {{in the center of the}} country with less than 5% of Saudi's population, but known as the strict religious Wahhabi heartland of Saudi Arabia. Senior judges will only allow like-minded graduates of select religious institutes to join the judiciary and will remove judges that stray away from rigidly conservative judgments.|$|E

25|$|American judges {{frequently}} wear black robes. American <b>judges</b> <b>have</b> ceremonial gavels, although American <b>judges</b> <b>have</b> court deputies or bailiffs {{and contempt}} of court power as their main devices to maintain decorum in the courtroom. However, {{in some of the}} Western United States, like California, judges did not always wear robes and instead wore everyday clothing. Today, some members of state supreme courts, such as the Maryland Court of Appeals wear distinct dress. In Italy and Portugal, both judges and lawyers wear particular black robes.|$|E

25|$|Most {{lawsuits}} that are active are currently on hold awaiting {{the outcome of}} his criminal trial. Some are still allowed to file motions and depose witnesses, {{with the exception of}} Bill Cosby himself, but most <b>judges</b> <b>have</b> indicated that a civil trial will not take place until after the criminal trial.|$|E
25|$|Despite the Court's {{avoidance}} of mention of software in the opinion, the Alice decision {{has had a}} dramatic effect on the validity of so-called software patents and business-method patents. Since Alice, these patents have suffered a very high mortality rate. Hundreds of patents have been invalidated under §101 of the U.S. patent laws in Federal District Courts. Applying Alice, district court <b>judges</b> <b>have</b> found many of these claims to be patent-ineligible abstract ideas.|$|E
25|$|As a {{criminal}} appellate court in appealed cases where lay <b>judges</b> <b>have</b> {{taken part in}} the County Court trial, the High Court is composed of three High Court judges and three lay judges. In cases where special knowledge is needed, i.e. cases regarding removal of children from their parents, specialists may appear as judges.

50|$|Robert Wilson, {{a teacher}} and later principal, was {{likewise}} convicted of acts of cruelty involving vulnerable children but was cleared on appeal {{on the basis that}} the <b>judge</b> <b>had</b> made an error in his summing-up.

25|$|Unfortunately, in Mega-City One's history {{there have}} been {{occasions}} when chief <b>judges</b> <b>have</b> abused their considerable power. When Chief Judge McGruder suspended the Council of Five in 2112 and ruled alone there was no mechanism for legally removing her from office when her mental health deteriorated and her decisions became increasingly erratic. She eventually resigned of her own accord in 2116, but {{by this time the}} undesirability of vesting too much authority in one individual had become apparent even to the hardline right-wing Judges of Mega-City One.|$|E
25|$|The Act {{has been}} criticised by judges {{on the basis}} that it does not {{incorporate}} all the rights in the Convention into domestic law. Legal commentators have also pointed out that the Convention is not a modern human rights instrument and was drafted in the 1940s as a response to specific historical circumstances. The values which it embodies are said to be those of a different generation and omits in particular children's rights, information rights and socio-economic rights. Senior <b>judges</b> <b>have</b> called for a more critical approach.|$|E

Silver attempted suicide and was later executed for dereliction of duty. Fargo resigned and then attempted suicide, but this was covered up and the public were told he had been killed in the line of duty.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} judges {{is very low}} {{considering}} the workload. In 2002, Montana District Courts heard 10,673 civil cases and 7,046 criminal cases. Yet, in 2003, {{the maximum number of}} judges in a judicial district was just four. The total number of judges was 42 in 2006, and 43 in 2011. <b>Judges</b> <b>have</b> been added to the system only irregularly, in 1979, 1983, 1999, 2001, 2005, and 2009. As of the end of 2016, there were just 46 judges, and only the 13th District had been permitted by the legislature to expand beyond four judges.|$|E
25|$|Several acting <b>Judges</b> <b>have</b> {{also been}} {{appointed}} to sit whenever a permanent judge was {{unable to do so}} due to illness or a conflict of interest. These judges were appointed from the retired judges of the Court of Appeal and including Justices Sir John Henry, Sir Ted Thomas, former President of the Court of Appeal Sir Ivor Richardson and former Chief Justice Sir Thomas Eichelbaum. Acting judges only sit on substantive appeals, and not applications for leave, due to the requirement for appeals to be heard en banc by five judges.|$|E
