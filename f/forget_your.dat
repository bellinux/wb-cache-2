500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} on the website Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, [...] "Sweet Sacrifice" [...] is an alternative metal and gothic metal song, set in common time and performed in moderate tempo of 96 beats per minute. It is written in the key of F# minor and Lee's vocals for the song range from the musical note of A#3 to G5. According to IGN's Ed Thompson, Lee sings the lines [...] "It's true we're all a little insane/But it's so clear now that I'm unchained", with her [...] "haunting vocals". Some critics found dark lyrics like [...] "I dream in darkness, I sleep to die, erase the silence, erase my life, our burning ashes darken the day, a world of nothingness, blow me away" [...] accompanied with [...] "rumbling guitars" [...] and a string section. A writer for the website Sputnikmusic found similarities between the songs on Fallen and [...] "Sweet Sacrifice". The main theme for the song is getting over from an abusive relationship. Jordan Reimer of The Daily Princetonian concluded that Lee sings the lines [...] "You know you live to break me" [...] and [...] "Are you still too weak to survive your mistakes?" [...] to Evanescence's past guitarist Ben Moody. That sentiment was echoed by Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone, {{who said that the}} lyrics [...] "One day I'm gonna <b>forget</b> <b>your</b> name/And one sweet day, you're gonna drown in my lost pain" [...] are aimed at Moody.|$|E

2500|$|Granada's boldness {{was seen}} in ambitious documentaries such as Seven Up!, which premièred in 1964. The {{programme}} was a social experiment which followed the lives of 14 British children aged seven.

The documentary was voted the greatest ever by esteemed film-makers and its latest instalment, 56 Up, premièred in 2012. Seven Up {{was part of the}} World in Action documentary series between 1963 and 1998, which won awards but was controversial. It garnered a reputation for hard-hitting investigative journalism and its producer Gus Macdonald commented that the programme was 'born brash.' Paul Greengrass said that David Plowright told him, [...] "don't <b>forget,</b> <b>your</b> job's to make trouble." [...] World in Action demonstrated hard-hitting investigative journalism and explored issues such as police corruption at the Metropolitan Police in 1985 and the Royal Family's tax loophole in 1991. The programme led a campaign to prove the innocence of the Birmingham Six in 1985 when researcher Chris Mullin questioned the convictions; by 1991 the men had been released from prison.|$|E
