5|$|Leoš Janáček's {{literary}} legacy {{represents an}} important illustration of his life, public work and art between 1875 and 1928. He contributed {{not only to}} music journals, but wrote essays, reports, reviews, feuilletons, articles and books. His {{work in this area}} comprises around 380 <b>individual</b> <b>items.</b> His writing changed over time, and appeared in many genres. Nevertheless, the critical and theoretical sphere remained his main area of interest.|$|E
5|$|Mrs. R.F. Herrick bought Kinman's {{traveling}} museum {{collection of}} 186 items, {{including at least}} two of his famous chairs, and displayed them in San Francisco in 1893. She then took the collection to Chicago to display them at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, where she reportedly sold the <b>individual</b> <b>items.</b> The Clarke Historical Museum in Eureka displays a suit of his buckskins, complete with beaded moccasins, as well as a wooden chest he owned. The Ferndale Museum displays several Kinman items, including another of his buckskin suits.|$|E

25|$|Among other things, {{the purpose}} of IRT {{is to provide a}} {{framework}} for evaluating how well assessments work, and how well <b>individual</b> <b>items</b> on assessments work. The most common application of IRT is in education, where psychometricians use it for developing and designing exams, maintaining banks of items for exams, and equating the difficulties of items for successive versions of exams (for example, to allow comparisons between results over time).|$|E

Since 2006, the building and its surroundings have also been listed {{as part of the}} UNESCO World Heritage Site buffer zone for the Sydney Opera House.|$|E
25|$|The great {{majority}} of slug species are harmless to humans and to their interests, but {{a small number of}} species are serious pests of agriculture and horticulture. They can destroy foliage faster than plants can grow, thus killing even fairly large plants. They also feed on fruits and vegetables prior to harvest, making holes in the crop, which can make <b>individual</b> <b>items</b> unsuitable to sell for aesthetic reasons, and can make the crop more vulnerable to rot and disease.|$|E

30|$|Let us now {{define the}} scope of this survey. The term web content is {{effectively}} generic as it broadly defines any type of information on a web site. It can refer both to the subject of the information and the <b>individual</b> <b>item</b> used to deliver the information. In this survey we define web content as any <b>individual</b> <b>item</b> (in the form of text, image, audio, or video), publicly available on a web site, which contains a measure that reflects a certain level of interest showed by an online community.|$|R
50|$|Once a {{campaign}} has ended and successfully reached its sales goal, the shirts ordered by buyers are sourced to a screen-printing facility. The designs are then printed on each <b>individual</b> <b>item.</b>|$|R
25|$|Costume {{designer}} Annie Symons and {{her staff}} of thirty had to create more than 3000 costumes and 35,000 <b>individual</b> <b>items</b> of clothing for the cast. The characters of Zhivago and Lara each had at least 90 costume combinations, and six other principal characters {{had an average of}} fifteen changes each. By the time principal photography ended, a total of 984 yards of fabric, 300,000 yards of thread, 1 million buttons, and 7,000 safety pins were used.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} study the use of <b>individual</b> <b>items</b> it is {{necessary}} to look for traces of wear such as pseudo-retouches, breakage or wear, including areas that are polished. If the item is in a good condition is possible to submit it to use-wear analysis, which is discussed in more detail below. Apart from these generalities, which are common to all carved archaeological pieces, hand axes need a technical analysis of their manufacture and a morphological analysis.|$|E
25|$|The new user {{interface}} (UI), officially known as Fluent User Interface, has been {{implemented in the}} core Microsoft Office applications: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, and in the item inspector used to create or edit <b>individual</b> <b>items</b> in Outlook. These applications have been selected for the UI overhaul because they center around document authoring. The rest of the applications in the suite changed to the new UI in subsequent versions. The default font used in this edition is Calibri. Original prototypes of the new {{user interface}} were revealed at MIX 2008 in Las Vegas.|$|E

25|$|Despite Housman’s {{appeal to}} male readers, some female composers have also set <b>individual</b> <b>items</b> as songs. They include Rebecca Clarke’s “Eight o’ clock” (1928); “Yonder see the morning blink” (1929) by Freda Mary Swain (1902-85); and “The Deserter” {{included}} in Elisabeth Lutyens 6 Songs (1934-6). Post-war settings include “The night is freezing fast” (1958) by Margarita L. Merriman (b.1927); “We’ll {{to the woods}} no more” (1962) by Mayme Chanwai (b. Hong Kong, 1939); “The half moon westers low” (1965) by the American Susan Calvin; “The laws of God, the laws of man” by Joyce Howard Barrell; and “Her strong enchantments failing” (retitled as “The queen of air and darkness”), together with “Eight o’clock”, by Elaine Hugh-Jones (2011).|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{ambiguity}} over {{the source of}} <b>individual</b> <b>items</b> derived from gelatin, many Orthodox rabbis regard it as generally being nonkosher. However, Conservative rabbis and several prominent Orthodox rabbis, including Chaim Ozer Grodzinski and Ovadia Yosefthe former Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israelargue that gelatin has undergone such total chemical change and processing {{that it should not}} count as meat, and therefore would be kosher. Technically, gelatin is produced by separating the three strands in each collagen fiber's triple helix by boiling collagen in water. Rabbi Dr. David Sheinkopf, author of Gelatin in Jewish Law (Bloch 1982) and Issues in Jewish Dietary Laws (Ktav 1998), has published in-depth studies of the kosher uses of gelatin, as well as carmine and kitniyot.|$|E
25|$|Old Ebbitt Grill was {{purchased}} on June 16, 1970, at a tax sale by the Stuart Davidson and John Laytham, co-owners {{of the restaurant}} Clyde's of Georgetown. Clyde's was founded in 1963 by Davidson (then an investment banker) after new legislation made it legal to consume liquor to patrons standing at bars. (Since 1917, liquor could be consumed only while sitting at tables.) Davidson and Laytham bid in the tax sale hoping to buy beer steins and the mahogany bar, but {{ended up with the}} entire restaurant. The IRS offered the entire restaurant for sale after an auction of <b>individual</b> <b>items</b> failed to raise more than $6,639. The sale price was $11,250. Among the items they purchased were a 200-year-old clock (which used carved wooden gears for its mechanism), a carved wooden grizzly bear once owned by Alexander Hamilton, crystal decanters dating to 1575, and stuffed boar's head, swordfish, alligator, and walrus head.|$|E

25|$|The Archibald S. Alexander Library in New Brunswick is {{the oldest}} and the largest library of the University, and houses an {{extensive}} humanities and social science collection. It also supports the work of faculty and staff at four professional schools: the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy, the Graduate School of Education, the Graduate School of Social Work, and the School of Communication and Information. Alexander Library is also a Federal Depository Library, maintaining a large collection of government documents, which contains United States, New Jersey, foreign, and international government publications. The Library of Science and Medicine (LSM) on the Busch Campus in Piscataway houses the University's collection in behavioral, biological, earth, and pharmaceutical sciences and engineering. LSM {{also serves as a}} designated depository library for government publication regarding science, and owns a U.S. patent collection and patent search facility. It was officially established as the Library of Science and Medicine in July 1964 although the beginning of the development of a library for science started in 1962. The current character of LSM is a university science library also serving a medical school. On the New Brunswick-Piscataway campus, in addition to Alexander Library, many individual disciplines have their own libraries, including Alcohol Studies, Art History, Chemistry, Mathematics, Music, and Physics. Special Collections and University Archives houses the Sinclair New Jersey Collection, manuscript collection, and rare book collection, as well as the University Archives. Although located in the Alexander Library building, Special Collections and University Archives actually comprises a distinct unit unto itself. Also located within the Alexander Library is the East Asian Library which holds a sizable collection of Chinese, Japanese and Korean monographs and periodicals. In Newark, the John Cotton Dana Library, which includes the Institute of Jazz Studies, and the Paul Robeson Library in Camden, serve their respective campuses with a broad collection of volumes. <b>Individual</b> <b>items</b> and collections within the Libraries can be identified using the Rutgers University Library Catalog.|$|E

The collection includes a cycad fossil dating from the Jurassic era that weighs 500 pounds (227kg). One meteorite is the Gibeon meteorite which weighs 210 pounds (95kg) and came from the African nation of Namibia. The world's largest known opal-filled thunderegg, weighing 1.75 tons (1600kg), is housed at the museum. The thunderegg is Oregon's state rock.

500|$|Nor was [...] {{the only}} general {{classifier}} {{in the history}} of Chinese. The aforementioned [...] jiè was being used as a general classifier before the Qin Dynasty (221 BCE); it was originally a noun referring to <b>individual</b> <b>items</b> out of a string of connected shells or clothes, and eventually came {{to be used as a}} classifier for [...] "individual" [...] objects (as opposed to pairs or groups of objects) before becoming a general classifier. Another general classifier was [...] méi, which originally referred to small twigs. Since twigs were used for counting items, [...] became a counter word: any items, including people, could be counted as [...] "one , two [...] ", etc. [...] was the most common classifier in use during the Southern and Northern Dynasties period (420–589 CE), but today is no longer a general classifier, and is only used rarely, as a specialized classifier for items such as pins and badges. Kathleen Ahrens has claimed that [...] (zhī in Mandarin and jia in Taiwanese), the classifier for animals in Mandarin, is another general classifier in Taiwanese and may be becoming one in the Mandarin spoken in Taiwan.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} Hoxne Hoard was discovered, there was speculation, {{based on the}} name [...] "Faustinus" [...] {{engraved}} {{on one of the}} spoons, that it may have come from the [...] "Villa Faustini" [...] that is recorded in Itinerary V of the Antonine Itinerary. The exact location of Villa Faustini is unknown, but as it was the first station after Colchester, it {{is believed to have been}} somewhere on the Pye Road (modern A140) and one of the possible locations for it is the modern village of Scole, only a couple of miles from Hoxne. This early theory has since been rejected, however, because [...] "Faustinus" [...] was historically a common name, and it only occurs on a single spoon in the hoard. Furthermore, the logic of using inscriptions on <b>individual</b> <b>items</b> in the hoard to determine ownership of the hoard as a whole is considered flawed. Based on the dating of the coins in the hoard, the majority of which belong to the period 394–405, it also has been speculated that the contents of the hoard originally belonged to a military family that accompanied Count Theodosius to Britain in 368–369, and which may have left with Constantine III in 407.|$|E
500|$|The <b>individual</b> <b>items</b> in an m × n matrix A, often {{denoted by}} a'i,j, where max i = m and max j = n, are called its {{elements}} or entries. Provided {{that they have}} the same size (each matrix has the same number of rows and the same number of columns as the other), two matrices can be added or subtracted element by element (see Conformable matrix). The rule for matrix multiplication, however, is that two matrices can be multiplied only when the number of columns in the first equals the number of rows in the second (i.e., the inner dimensions are the same, n for A'm,n × B'n,p). Any matrix can be multiplied element-wise by a scalar from its associated field. A major application of matrices is to represent linear transformations, that is, generalizations of linear functions such as [...] For example, the rotation of vectors in three-dimensional space is a linear transformation, which can be represented by a rotation matrix R: if v is a column vector (a matrix with only one column) describing the position of a point in space, the product Rv is a column vector describing the position of that point after a rotation. The product of two transformation matrices is a matrix that represents the composition of two transformations. Another application of matrices is in the solution of systems of linear equations. If the matrix is square, it is possible to deduce some of its properties by computing its determinant. For example, a square matrix has an inverse if and only if its determinant is not zero. Insight into the geometry of a linear transformation is obtainable (along with other information) from the matrix's eigenvalues and eigenvectors.|$|E
