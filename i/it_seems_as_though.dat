25|$|These studies {{point to}} the fact that even though we only attend to and process limited information, we have a vast amount of {{knowledge}} at our disposal through our highly unrestricted sensory registers.

[...] In 1956, he recorded a version, titled [...] "Call It Stormy Monday", with pianist Lloyd Glenn, bassist Billy Hadnott, and drummer Oscar Bradley (Glenn and Bradley had performed for the original 1947 recording). It was produced by Nesuhi Ertegun and is included on Walker's 1959 album, T-Bone Blues, for Atlantic Records. [...] Writer Bill Dahl described the remake as [...] "luxurious" [...] with Walker's guitar [...] "so crisp and clear <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he's sitting right next to you". Another recording, titled [...] "Stormy Monday", is included on the 1968 album, Stormy Monday Blues for Bluesway Records.

500|$|In 1973, DEC {{commissioned}} {{the creation of}} a real-time, graphical version of Lunar Lander, which was intended to showcase the capabilities of their new DEC GT40 graphics terminals. The game, which was written by Jack Burness and named Moonlander, was distributed with DEC computers and displayed at trade shows. An arcade game version of the game concept was released as Lunar Lander in 1979 by Atari, which featured a fuel-for-money system allowing the player to purchase more fuel to continue their current game. Other versions of the graphical game were released for various systems, including Jupiter Lander for the Commodore 64, Retrofire for Atari 8-bit computers, and Apollo 11 for the ZX Spectrum. Critics have claimed that the text-based version of the game was the most popular computer game of its time, and so many versions of the graphical game exist that in 1981 Electronic Games claimed: [...] "sometimes <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> every company capable of copying a cassette is trying to sell a game on this theme." ...|$|E

500|$|Computer Gaming World {{described}} Lunar Lander in 1982 {{as one of}} {{the first}} fun programs entry level programmers start with and continually improve upon as they improve their skills. By 1973, there were numerous versions of the text-based game, and so many versions of the graphical game existed by 1981 that Electronic Games, in a review of a version by Scott Adams for Atari 8-bit computers and the TRS-80, claimed it was [...] "yet another entry in a field as crowded as the category of Space Invaders imitators. Sometimes <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> every company capable of copying a cassette is trying to sell a game on this theme." [...] According to the authors of Grand Thieves & Tomb Raiders, Moon Lander for the MK14 (1977) w{{as one of the}} first three commercial games in Britain for home computers. The game type even spawned at least one meta-game; Antic, in March 1986, named Lunar Lander Construction Set as its game of the month, a BASIC game for Atari 8-bit computers in which the player can construct their own version of the graphical Lunar Lander. In Science Fiction Video Games (2014), while discussing the games' lack of science fiction concepts like aliens or unrealistic physics, author Neal Roger Tringham described the series as [...] "one of the few video games to be based on to be based on a real space program, as opposed to the many games inspired by fictional forms of space exploration".|$|E

500|$|The film {{received}} negative {{reviews in}} trade publications {{and it was}} deemed a distinct departure from the nature of other Thanhouser releases. The film's plot was criticized by reviewers for being concerned main character's misery. In response to the illogical plot, the The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer stated, [...] "Why the cripple should go West {{as soon as he}} is able to hobble isn't clear; perhaps the West is such a delightfully vague term that it induces haziness of reasoning." [...] The reviewer also noted the inexplicable reason why Allen, who originally fled, would suddenly consent to be willingly murdered by John. The reviewer opined that the story was almost maudlin in places and the acting was not sincere because the actors knew the plot was absurd. The Moving Picture World also reviewed the film quite negatively, [...] "Possibly the dramatic qualities of this picture are sufficient reason for its existence; but it has no other reason. It is not entertaining. It is not instructive. It cannot amuse. The shadow of death pervades it and the horror tragedy is the principal factor. It is such a departure from the usual Thanhouser that <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the regular producer was absent when it flipped past the company's censor." [...] Advertisers for the film listed it {{in a variety of ways}} from a strong drama to having real mining activities. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
500|$|During the regal period, {{the king}} {{nominated}} two Quaestors {{to serve as}} his assistants, and after {{the overthrow of the}} monarchy, the Consuls retained this authority. However, in 447 BC, Cicero recorded that the Quaestors began to be elected by a tribal assembly that was presided over by a magistrate. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> this was the first instance of a joint Patricio-Plebeian Tribal Assembly, and thus was probably an enormous gain for the Plebeians. While Patricians were able to vote in a joint assembly, there were never very many Patricians in Rome. Thus, most of the electors were Plebeians, and yet any magistrate elected by a joint assembly had jurisdiction over both Plebeians and Patricians. Therefore, for the first time, the Plebeians seemed to have indirectly acquired authority over Patricians. During the 4th century BC, a series of reforms were passed (the leges Valeriae Horatiae), which ultimately required that any law passed by the Plebeian Council have the full force of law over both Plebeians and Patricians. This gave the Plebeian Tribunes, who presided over the Plebeian Council, a positive character for the first time. Before these laws were passed, Tribunes could only interpose the sacrosanctity of their person (intercessio) to veto acts of the senate, assemblies, or magistrates. It was a modification to the Valerian law in 449 BC which first allowed acts of the Plebeian Council to have the full force of law, but eventually the final law in the series was passed (the [...] "Hortensian Law"), which removed the last check that the Patricians in the senate had over this power.|$|E
500|$|Paste {{magazine}} writer Brent Koepp {{called it}} [...] "another incredible episode" [...] {{and said the}} impending conflict between Walter and Gus [...] "has the makings of one of television's finest showdowns". He also said the script made good use of the supporting characters, and that the growing distance between Hank and Marie was particularly well handled. Matt Seitz of Salon.com compared [...] "Thirty-Eight Snub" [...] to excellent third season episodes that had [...] "very few scenes and sequences but luxuriated in them, allowing the characters (and the viewer) time to experience the tiny eddies and currents of the moment". He also called an overhead shot of Walter standing outside Gus' house alone [...] "one of the best shots in the show's history". Tim Surette of TV.com especially praised the scene with Walter approaching Gus' house, writing: [...] "Breaking Bad has always been good at creating an air of tension, but now <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the series has mastered it. He also said Paul's acting during Jesse's emotional breakdown [...] "ripped my heart out and shredded it to pieces". The Hollywood Reporter writer Tim Goodman said the photography and direction during Jesse's party scenes was masterful: [...] "Here we are four seasons into Breaking Bad and I shouldn't still be amazed at the innovated visuals or perfectly honed sense of sound. These are masters at work, people." [...] Slate writers Jessica Grose and June Thomas both enjoyed the episode, although they found Walter's character increasingly difficult to sympathize with. Both praised the scene when Mike attacked Walter, while Grose especially enjoyed Aaron Paul's performance and Skyler's subplot.|$|E

500|$|In 1975, the Columbia album The Basement Tapes was compiled, {{mainly by}} Robertson and {{engineer}} Rob Fraboni. Robertson and Fraboni put thirty-five {{of the songs}} onto composite reels of tape, and Heylin believes these represented {{a short list of}} candidates for the album. [...] "Santa-Fe" [...] was included on these composite reels, but was not ultimately chosen for the album. The Basement Tapes included sixteen Dylan songs recorded at Big Pink in 1967, as well as eight Band demos from various times and locations between 1967 and 1975. One Dylan song on the album, [...] "Goin' to Acapulco", had not appeared on his 1967 fourteen-song acetate or on bootlegs, and this alerted the world to the possibility that there might be more Basement Tape songs in existence. In 1986, at least twenty-five previously unknown 1967 songs by Dylan and the Band passed into collectors' hands by way of a former roadie of the Band's. In the early 1990s, a third batch of songs, these ones from Garth Hudson's archives, came to light around the time Columbia was preparing The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3; [...] "Santa-Fe" [...] comes from this group. In his liner notes for The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3, John Bauldie commented on these second and third stages in which groups of Big Pink songs had come to light: [...] "Despite the... emergence [...] in collectors' circles of a further couple of hours of Basement Tapes, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> there's a good deal left unheard. 'Santa-Fe' is just one example of a batch of previously unsuspected Basement tracks". By 1992, the [...] "Santa-Fe" [...] batch of songs had been obtained by bootleggers, and almost all known Dylan Basement Tape songs were assembled onto the 5-CD bootleg The Genuine Basement Tapes. [...] "Sante-Fe" [...] was also included on the 2014 compilations [...] and the latter album officially released a fourth batch of previously uncirculating Basement Tape songs.|$|E

2500|$|L. T. Fitz {{outwardly}} {{claims that}} early criticism of Antony and Cleopatra is [...] "colored by the sexist assumptions the critics have {{brought with them}} to their reading." [...] Fitz argues that previous criticisms place a heavy emphasis on Cleopatra's [...] "wicked and manipulative" [...] ways, which are further emphasised by her association with Egypt and her contrast to the [...] "chaste and submissive" [...] Roman Octavia. Finally, Fitz emphasises the tendency of early critics to assert that Antony is the sole protagonist of the play. This claim is apparent in Brandes argument: [...] "when [...] perishes, a prey to the voluptuousness of the East, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> Roman greatness and the Roman Republic expires with him." [...] Yet Fitz points out that Antony dies in Act IV while Cleopatra (and therefore Egypt) is present throughout Act V until she commits suicide {{at the end and}} [...] "would seem to fulfill at least the formal requirements of the tragic hero." ...|$|E

2500|$|Beauty and the Beast is {{considered}} to be Broadway's first legitimate family show, responsible for birthing an entirely new generation of young theatregoers. The family demographic of the musical established inspired international productions of Aladdin and Matilda. According to The Complete Book of 1990s Broadway Musicals author Dan Dietz, [...] "the show's resounding success opened the floodgates for a spate of... productions based on Disney and other family-oriented films", transforming Broadway into [...] "a theme park with a parade of musicals aimed at kids and teenagers." [...] Dietz believes that the plethora of Broadway musicals that came after Beauty and the Beast have unfortunately resembled [...] "feel-good family show whose goal was to emulate its film source." [...] Additionally, the success of the musical inspired a legion of Broadway productions geared towards young women, including Hairspray (2002), Wicked (2003), Legally Blonde (2007), Matilda (2013) and Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella (2013). While these musicals flourished on Broadway, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> more serious, adult-oriented fare struggled to perform as well.
