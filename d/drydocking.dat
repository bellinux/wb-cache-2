5|$|In early December 1942 Siboney {{departed}} for Newfoundland but put into Halifax {{for two months}} of <b>drydocking</b> and repairs after she collided with SS City of Kimberly. After returning to New York in February 1943, she made several transatlantic runs, calling at Casablanca, Oran, Gibraltar, Clyde, Durban, Rio de Janeiro, Trinidad, and Cuba over the next 11 months. Siboney returned to New York for major repairs and reboilering at Bethlehem Steel Co. In January 1944, while undergoing this work, the ship was selected for conversion to a hospital ship.|$|E
5|$|Since {{being brought}} to London Belfast has twice been drydocked {{as part of the}} ship’s {{long-term}} preservation. In 1982 she was docked at Tilbury, and in June 1999 Belfast was towed to Portsmouth. This {{was the first time she}} had been to sea in 28 years and thus required a Certificate of Seaworthiness from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. While in dock, her entire hull was cleaned, blasted, and repainted, her hull blanking plates inspected and an ultrasonic survey carried out. She is not expected to require further <b>drydocking</b> until 2020. While under tow to Portsmouth she was delayed by bad weather and arrived a day late: it had been intended that she would arrive on 6 June 1999, the fifty-fifth anniversary of the Normandy landings. During the maintenance work, Belfast hull and topsides were repainted in her specific camouflage scheme officially known as Admiralty Disruptive Camouflage Type 25, which she had worn from November 1942 to July 1944. This was objected to by some, due to the anachronistic conflict between her camouflage, which reflects the majority of her active Second World War service, and her present configuration, which was the result of the ship's extended refit from January 1956 to May 1959. With the establishment of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport's (DCMS) Advisory Committee on National Historic Ships in 2006, Belfast was listed as part of the National Historic Fleet.|$|E

25|$|When China Navigation Co Ltd {{bought the}} South Pacific service from Andrew Weir Shipping in 2006, the four SA-15 class freighters were time {{chartered}} {{by the new}} owner and further modified during <b>drydocking</b> in Singapore. During the refit an additional Wärtsilä Auxpac 6L20 generating set, capable of operating on the same grade of heavy fuel oil as the main engines, was installed alongside the existing smaller 624TS diesel generators and some ballast tanks were converted to heavy fuel oil to increase the bunker capacity. Fuel efficiency was further improved by grit blasting the underwater parts to minimize hull roughness and installing wake-equalising ducts and a rudder bulb. The ships' container capacity was also increased to 702 TEU.|$|E
25|$|In 1995 Bank Line, a {{subsidiary}} of Andrew Weir Shipping Ltd, purchased four SA-15 class ships, Okha, Bratsk, Tiksi and Nikel, for their westbound round-the-world liner service linking Europe to the South Pacific Islands and Papua New Guinea via the Panama and Suez Canals. The ships, no longer required to sail in the arctic conditions, were renamed Speybank, Arunbank, Foylebank and Teignbank and converted in the United Kingdom for the South Pacific service. In 2006 China Navigation Co Ltd, the deep-sea shipping arm of John Swire & Sons Ltd, bought the business from Andrew Weir Shipping. The ships, while still managed by Bank Line, were time chartered, renamed to Mahinabank, Tikeibank, Gazellebank and Boularibank, and sent to Singapore for <b>drydocking</b> and extensive refits. Later the company also chartered two more SA-15 class ships, Anatoliy Kolesnichenko and Vasiliy Burkhanov, but unlike the others they were not rebuilt and retained their Russian identity. However, due to the economic downturn of 2009 the round-the-world cargo liner service was discontinued, the charters were ended, and the four converted SA-15 class ships were returned to their original owner and sold for scrap in late 2009.|$|E
25|$|After the {{cessation}} of hostilities with Spain, Manning returned to the operational control of the Revenue Cutter Service. Her patrol duties took her along both the East Coast from Boston to Key West and included a patrol to Cuba and Puerto Rico. On 2 January 1900 Manning was ordered report to San Francisco {{by way of the}} Straits of Magellan for duties with the Bering Sea Patrol. During the years of 1900 through 1916 she patrolled the Bering Sea enforcing sealing treaties to prevent pelagic sealing and performing search and rescue duties, missing only the years 1904, 1906 and 1908. On her first Bering Sea cruise in 1900, Manning conducted hydrographic surveys as well as sealing patrols. She also rescued the passengers of the stranded barkentine Leslie D that was wrecked on Nunivak Island. On 6 September 1903 the passengers and crew of the schooner Abbie M. Deering that was wrecked on Baby Island were delivered safely to Unalaska by Manning. Later the same day, the crew was called upon by Captain Michael Healy of the USRC Thetis to assist in fighting a fire on the American ship St. Francis {{on the opposite side of}} the wharf from Thetis. In 1904 she performed patrol duties along the West Coast. During the 1905 Bering Sea cruise, the crew of Manning distributed boxes of clothing to natives of Attu and Atka that were provided by the Women's National Relief Association and during a second trip delivered more boxes of clothes donated by a Seattle, Washington hardware store to a warehouse at Dutch Harbor so that other cutters on the patrol could deliver them to other settlements. On 13 December 1905 Manning was assigned patrol duties in Hawaii where she remained until 8 May 1907 when she departed for the Bering Sea. Patrol work was cut short during the 1907 season when Manning struck an uncharted rock in Prince William Sound 15 August. Temporary repairs were made and she made for Bremerton Navy Yard for <b>drydocking</b> and permanent repairs in September. During 1908 Manning patrolled the Pacific Coast and assisted in several search and rescue cases.|$|E

40|$|The Naval Shipyard Optimal <b>Drydock</b> Loading and Capacity Utilization Model {{presented}} in this thesis is a tool to optimally load the Naval Shipyard's <b>drydocks.</b> The problem is constrained by the length, type and timing of each ship's required maintenance; current and projected capabilities of existing drydocks; current load of the drydocks; and the requirement to perform maintenance on the <b>drydocks.</b> Prior to this model, the Navy used a suboptimal, manual procedure that took one to two weeks to perform. This inefficiency became critical when an Assistant Secretary of the Navy requested a <b>drydock</b> capacity utilization study, requiring optimal loadings under numerous scenarios. An optimization model which lacks limiting assumptions, allows easy modification of input data and is capable of quick analysis of <b>drydock</b> loading scenarios was developed and executed fast enough to provide timely answers.
