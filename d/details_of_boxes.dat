40|$|Task {{was to find}} an {{innovative}} aircraft design for a new medium range aircraft. The aircraft design methodology is based on equations (in contrast to numeric methods) and formal optimization with a genetic algorithm called differential evolution. Airbus has postponed an all-new A 320 to 2025 or even 2030. This allows including also unconventional configurations into the search. Economic requirements are extreme: 25 % to 40 % reduction in fuel consumption, 35 % reduction in Cash Operating Costs. To achieve this, all aircraft design parameters have to be open for discussion. An aircraft called "The Rebel" is prepared to go to extreme parameters: low cruise speed, high wing span and long take-off and landing distance. Without new technologies it achieves 36 % reduced fuel consumption. The "Smart Turboprop" stays in conventional limits with its parameters, but makes use of a braced wing with natural laminar flow. It also achieves 36 % reduced fuel consumption plus a 17 % reduction in Direct Operating Costs (DOC). In addition, several Box Wing Aircraft where designed: Diamond Box Wing and Biplane Box Wing as Wide Body and alternatively as Slender Body. The Biplane Box Wing shows overall advantages due to its conventional tail. The <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>Box</b> Wing Aircraft design where mastered, but the Direct Operating Costs <b>of</b> the <b>Box</b> Wing Aircraft {{turned out to be}} higher than those of the A 320 reference. This leaves the "Smart Turboprop" as the proposed configuration for an Airbus A 320 replacement. As a short term measure, it is proposed to offer a horizontal wing tip extension as an option for the A 320 neo instead of the winglets. An extension with the same length as the winglet height offers far greater drag reduction. Airports will tolerate and accommodate some aircraft with a wing span above the ICAO limit in Class C of 36 m...|$|R

40|$|The use <b>of</b> {{artificial}} nest <b>boxes</b> has led {{to significant}} progress in bird conservation and {{in our understanding of}} the functional and evolutionary ecology of free-ranging birds that exploit cavities for roosting and reproduction. Nest boxes and their improved accessibility have made it easier to perform comparative and experimental field investigations. However, concerns about the generality and applicability of scientific studies involving birds breeding in nest boxes have been raised because the occupants <b>of</b> <b>boxes</b> may differ from conspecifics occupying other nest sites. Here, we review the existing evidence demonstrating the importance <b>of</b> nest <b>box</b> design to individual life-history traits in three falcon (Falconiformes) and seven owl (Strigiformes) species, as well as the extent to which publications on these birds describe the characteristics of exploited artificial nest boxes in their "Methods" sections. More than 60 % of recent publications did not provide any details on nest box design (e. g. size, shape, material), despite several calls > 15 years ago to increase the reporting of such information. We exemplify and discuss how variation in nest box characteristics can affect or confound conclusions from nest box studies and conclude that it is of overall importance to present <b>details</b> <b>of</b> nest <b>box</b> characteristics in scientific publications...|$|R

We calculate the acceptance of each detector and their resolution in measuring physical quantities from each pion photoproduction event detected. We then simulate the extraction of raw data from the experiment using both the Crystal Box and the NMS detectors, and present our results as to how well we believe each detector will perform at measuring the physical quantities of interest. Finally, we discuss possible refinements that could be implemented in the simulation to further improve the accuracy of these predictions. by Angel Roberto Solis Ortíz. Thesis (S. B.)

Possible overvoltages on these surges at cross-bonding connections {{of the cable}} screens are of major concern. A model is developed for modelling overvoltages from transient signal propagation through a combined cross-bonding cable and box. This model {{is applied to the}} first Dutch 400 kV cable connection. Such model incorporates model parameters whose values depend on design <b>details</b> <b>of</b> the cross-bonding <b>box.</b> The values for these model parameters are extracted from the measured transmission and reflection signal on steep pulses injected into the actual cross-bonding box configuration.

The model is applied to investigate overvoltages induced at the cross-bonding cable and box on 1. 2 / 50 ?s impulse voltage injection representing a lightning impulse voltage applied to the core conductor of the cross-bonding cable.

60|$|All {{these plans}} of ready action in Mooween's head, for the rare {{occasions}} when he meets you unexpectedly, {{are the result of}} careful training by his mother. If you should ever have the good fortune to watch a mother bear and her cubs when they have no idea that you are near them, you will note two characteristic things. First, when they are traveling--and Mooween is the most restless tramp in all the woods--you will see that the cubs follow the mother closely and imitate her every action with ludicrous exactness, sniffing where she sniffs, jumping where she jumps, rising on their hind legs, with forearms hanging loosely and pointed noses thrust sharp up into the wind, on the instant that she rises, and then drawing silently away from the shore into the shelter of the friendly alders when some subtle warning tells the mother's nose that the coast ahead is not perfectly clear. So they learn to sift the sounds and smells of the wilderness, and to govern their actions accordingly. And second, when they are playing you will see that the mother watches the cubs' every action as keenly as they watched hers an hour ago. She will sit flat on her haunches, her fore paws planted between her outstretched hind legs, her great head on one side, noting every <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> their <b>boxing</b> and wrestling and climbing, as if she had showed them once how it ought to be done and were watching now to see how well they remembered their lessons.

40|$|The {{structural}} design process of an adaptive wing trailing edge (ATED) was addressed {{in compliance with}} the demanding requirements posed by the implementation of the architecture on large aeroplanes. Fast and reliable elementary methods combined with rational design criteria were adopted in order to preliminarily define ATED box geometry, structural properties, and the general configuration of the embedded mechanisms enabling box morphing under the action of aerodynamic loads. Aeroelastic stability issues were duly taken in account in order to safely assess inertial and stiffness distributions of the primary structure as well as to provide requirements for the actuation system harmonics. Results and general guidelines coming from the preliminary design were then converted into <b>detailed</b> drawings <b>of</b> each <b>box</b> component. Implemented solutions were based on designer’s industrial experience and were mainly oriented to increase the structural robustness of the device, to minimize its manufacturing costs, and to simplify assembly and maintenance procedures.

40|$|Precast {{prestressed}} concrete adjacent box girders {{are widely used}} in short and medium span bridges. Rapid construction and economy are the main attractions of this system. The continuous flat soffit and relatively high span-to-depth ratio make this system aesthetically pleasing. However, reflective cracking and leakage have been reported along the longitudinal joints between adjacent boxes {{in a number of}} bridges. The cracking and leakage are mainly due to inadequate design and <b>detailing</b> <b>of</b> the transverse connection between adjacent boxes, which eventually lead to premature deterioration of the bridge superstructure. ^ This research presents a review of the current practices in the transverse design and <b>detailing</b> <b>of</b> adjacent <b>box</b> girder bridges. The PCI Bridge design Manual method for calculating the required transverse post-tensioning force and its design charts are reviewed. Because these charts are outdated, new charts are developed based on the 2007 AASHTO LRFD specifications for live load and dynamic load allowance. The effect of span-to-depth ratio and skew angle are also considered. A simplified design equation is developed to estimate the post-tensioning force per unit length of the bridge {{as a function of the}} governing parameters. ^ Two continuous non-post-tensioned transverse connections are proposed as alternatives to the current discrete post-tensioned connections. Proposed connections are designed to transfer transverse shear and moment without end or intermediate diaphragms. The first connection 2 ̆ 2 Narrow Joint 2 ̆ 2 consists of top and bottom couplers and full depth grouted shear keys. The second connection 2 ̆ 2 Wide Joint 2 ̆ 2 consists of a wide full depth shear key filled with flowable concrete and top and bottom reinforcement. Finite element models are developed for the analysis of the proposed connections and developing design charts to estimate the required reinforcement for different bridge configurations. Fatigue testing of the proposed connections as well as one of the commonly used connections has been carried out to evaluate the fatigue capacity and joint leakage. Test results have indicated that proposed connections outperform the existing connection. Static load testing and cost analysis of the three connections have demonstrated that the proposed connections have significantly higher flexural capacity in addition to being more economical than the current one. ...|$|R

Its proton linac will include 43 superconducting cavity cryomodules. The nominal operating temperature for the cavities is 2 K, with 40 - 50 K thermal shielding. Required cooling powers will be provided by the accelerator cryoplant and delivered in 4. 5  K and 40 K temperature levels. The 2 K temperature level will be produced at each cryomodule. The cryomodules will be connected with the cryoplant by a dedicated cryogenic distribution system. The system will be composed of a cryogenic transfer line with a splitting box and a cryogenic distribution line with 43 valve boxes and an end <b>box.</b> A number <b>of</b> high-level requirements for the ESS linac impose a highly branched structure for the cryogenic distribution system and strongly influence specific choices related to the <b>detailed</b> designs <b>of</b> valve <b>boxes</b> and cryogenic lines.
