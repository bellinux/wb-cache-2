25|$|Dog ear is {{a casing}} type with {{extensions}} at {{both sides of}} pickup. These are extensions of the predominantly rectangular cover, that encompass the outlying mounting screws. Dog-ear P-90 pickups were commonly mounted on Gibson's hollow-body guitars like the ES-330 and occasionally on solid-body models like the Les Paul Junior. The same pickups were also available on Epiphone models (since Gibson was building Epiphone guitars in the 1950s) and the design is best remembered for its appearance on the <b>hollow</b> <b>body</b> Epiphone Casino of {{the mid to late}} 1960s.|$|E
25|$|When {{a string}} is bowed or plucked, it vibrates and moves {{the air around}} it, {{producing}} sound waves. Because the string is quite thin, not much air is moved by the string itself, and consequently if the string was not mounted on a <b>hollow</b> <b>body,</b> the sound would be weak. In acoustic stringed instruments such as the cello, this lack of volume is solved by mounting the vibrating string on a larger hollow wooden body. The vibrations are transmitted to the larger body, which can move more air and produce a louder sound. Different designs of the instrument produces variations in the instrument’s vibrational patterns and thus changes {{the character of the}} sound produced. A string’s fundamental pitch can be adjusted by changing its stiffness, which depends on tension and length. Tightening a string stiffens it by increasing both the outward forces along its length and the net forces it experiences during a distortion. A cello can be tuned by adjusting the tension of its strings, by turning the tuning pegs mounted on its pegbox, and tension adjusters (fine tuners) on the tail piece.|$|E

500|$|Townshend {{played a}} 1959 Gretsch 6120 Chet Atkins <b>hollow</b> <b>body</b> guitar fed through an Edwards volume pedal to a Fender Bandmaster amp, {{all of which}} he had been given by Joe Walsh while in New York. This {{combination}} became his main electric guitar recording setup for subsequent albums. Although intended as a demo recording, the end result sounded so good to the band and Johns, they decided to use it as the final take. Overdubs, including an acoustic guitar part played by Townshend, were recorded at Olympic Studios at the end of April. The track was mixed at Island Studios by Johns on 28 May. After Lifehouse was abandoned as a project, Johns felt [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again", along with other songs, were so good that they could simply be released as a standalone single album, which became Who's Next.|$|E
2500|$|The {{balalaika}} ( [...] , [...] ) is a Russian stringed {{musical instrument}} with a characteristic triangular wooden, <b>hollow</b> <b>body</b> and three strings. Two strings are usually {{tuned to the}} same note and the third string is a perfect fourth higher. The higher-pitched balalaikas are used to play melodies and chords. The instrument generally has a short sustain, necessitating rapid strumming or plucking when it is used used to play melodies. Balalaikas are often used for Russian folk music and dancing.|$|E
2500|$|Travis' {{string of}} chart-topping honky-tonk {{hits in the}} 1940s did not {{continue}} into the 1950s, despite the reverence of friends like Grandpa Jones and Hank Thompson, with whom he toured and recorded as lead guitarist (Thompson, who could pick Travis-style, even had Gibson design him a Super 400 <b>hollow</b> <b>body</b> electric guitar {{identical to the one}} Travis began using in 1952). Travis continued recording for Capitol in the 1950s, broadening his repertoire to include new guitar instrumentals, blues and boogie numbers.

2500|$|To avoid {{feedback}} from the resonances of the <b>hollow</b> <b>body</b> under high amplification on stage, many instruments have a solid body instead. The timbre (tone color) of a standard unamplified violin is {{due in large part}} to these resonances, however, so depending on how the signal is picked up, an electric violin may have a [...] "rawer" [...] or [...] "sharper" [...] sound than an acoustic instrument. This raw sound is often preferred in rock, pop, and some avant-garde genres. Several [...] "semi-hollow" [...] designs exist, containing a sealed but hollow resonating chamber that provides some approximation of acoustic violin sound while reducing susceptibility to feedback.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010 Eric Clapton {{announced}} that he would be auctioning off over 150 items at a New York auction in 2011 with proceeds to go to his Crossroads Centre drug and rehabilitation centre in Antigua. Items included Clapton's guitar from the Cream reunion tour in 2005, speaker cabinets used in the early 1970s from his days with Derek and the Dominos, and some guitars from Jeff Beck, J. J. Cale, and Joe Bonamassa. In March 2011 Clapton raised more than US$2.15 million when he auctioned off key items, including a 1984 Gibson <b>hollow</b> <b>body</b> guitar, a Gianni Versace suit from his 1990 concert at the Royal Albert Hall, and a replica of the famous Fender Stratocaster known as [...] "Blackie", which fetched more than $30,000.

2500|$|The endpin or spike {{is made of}} wood, {{metal or}} rigid carbon fibre and {{supports}} the cello in playing position. The endpin can be retracted into the <b>hollow</b> <b>body</b> of the instrument when the cello is being transported in its case. This makes the cello easier to move about. When the performer wishes to play the cello, the endpin is pulled out to lengthen it. The endpin is locked into the player's preferred length with a screw mechanism. The adjustable nature of endpins enables performers of different ages and body sizes to adjust the endpin length to suit them. [...] In the Baroque period the cello was held between the calves, as there was no endpin at that time. The endpin was [...] "introduced by Adrien Servais [...] 1845 to give the instrument greater stability". Modern endpins are retractable and adjustable; older ones were removed when not in use. (The word [...] "endpin" [...] sometimes also refers to the button of wood located at this place in all instruments in the violin family, but this is usually called [...] "tailpin".) The sharp tip of the cello's endpin is sometimes capped with a rubber tip that protects the tip from dulling and prevents the cello from slipping on the floor. Many cellists use a rubber pad with a metal cup to keep the tip from slipping on the floor. A number of accessories to keep the endpin from slipping; these include ropes which attach to the chair leg and other devices.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout its career, {{the band}} has been {{described}} as alternative rock, stoner rock, alternative metal, and hard rock. Homme has described the band's self-titled debut album as driving music, angular and recorded dry, with the album featuring solid and repetitive riffs in its song structure. Rolling Stone magazine also noted a [...] "connection between American meat-and-potatoes macho rock of the early 1970s, like Blue Cheer and Grand Funk Railroad, and the precision-timing drones in German rock of the same period." [...] The band's following album - Rated R - contained a wider variety of instruments, several recording guests and lead vocals shared by Homme, Oliveri and Lanegan. Homme has also commented that [...] "Our first record announced our sound. This one added that we’re different and weird." [...] The band continued to experiment on their third album, Songs for the Deaf, which also featured a line-up including three lead vocalists, many guest appearances and wide range of instrumentation, including horn and string sections. Homme has described Lullabies to Paralyze as a [...] "dark" [...] album, which includes imagery inspired by The Brothers Grimm folk and fairy tales. In 2005, Homme explained, [...] "Where the poetry seems to be is when you start in the dark and reach for the light—that's what makes it not depressing to me..." [...] The album changed gears from the band's previous distinct [...] "driving" [...] sound, much due to the departure of longtime member Nick Oliveri. The band almost exclusively used semi <b>hollow</b> <b>body</b> guitars during the making of the record. With Era Vulgaris the band continued to develop their signature sound with more dance-oriented elements and electronic influences, while Homme has currently gone back to being the only lead vocalist in the band and uses more distinct vocal melodies.|$|E

The only question in the comparison is in regard to the character of the odors, and that is a matter of taste. In his work he is the reverse of Smollett, the latter being given over to coarse vulgarities, which are often mistaken for realism; the former to whims and vagaries and sentimental tears, which frequently only disguise a sneer at human grief and pity.|$|E
