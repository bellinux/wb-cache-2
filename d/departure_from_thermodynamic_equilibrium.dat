50|$|For {{equilibrium}} thermodynamics, in a thermodynamic {{state of}} a system, its contents are in internal thermodynamic equilibrium, with zero flows of all quantities, {{both internal and}} between system and surroundings. For Planck, the primary characteristic of a thermodynamic state {{of a system that}} consists of a single phase, {{in the absence of an}} externally imposed force field, is spatial homogeneity. For non-equilibrium thermodynamics, a suitable set of identifying state variables includes some macroscopic variables, for example a non-zero spatial gradient of temperature, that indicate <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> Such non-equilibrium identifying state variables indicate that some non-zero flow may be occurring within the system or between system and surroundings.|$|E
5000|$|A {{thermodynamic}} operation {{may occur}} as an event {{restricted to the}} walls that are within the surroundings, directly affecting neither the walls of contact {{of the system of}} interest with its surroundings, nor its interior, and occurring within a definitely limited time. For example, an immovable adiabatic wall may be placed or removed within the surroundings. Consequent upon such an operation restricted to the surroundings, the system may be for a time driven away from its own initial internal state of thermodynamic equilibrium. Then, according to the second law of thermodynamics, the whole undergoes changes and eventually reaches a new and final equilibrium with the surroundings. Following Planck, this consequent train of events is called a natural thermodynamic process. It is allowed in equilibrium thermodynamics just because the initial and final states are of thermodynamic equilibrium, even though during the process there is transient <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> when neither the system nor its surroundings are in well defined states of internal equilibrium. A natural process proceeds at a finite rate for the main part of its course. It is thereby radically different from a fictive quasi-static 'process' that proceeds infinitely slowly throughout its course, and is fictively 'reversible'. Classical thermodynamics allows that even though a process may take a very long time to settle to thermodynamic equilibrium, if the main part of its course is at a finite rate, then it is considered to be natural, and to be subject to the second law of thermodynamics, and thereby irreversible. Engineered machines and artificial devices and manipulations are permitted within the surroundings. The allowance of such operations and devices in the surroundings but not in the system is the reason why Kelvin in one of his statements of the second law of thermodynamics spoke of [...] "inanimate" [...] agency; a system in thermodynamic equilibrium is inanimate.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} universal, astrophysically based {{theory of the}} origin of life on Earth and on other rocky planets as well. Life is an {{information}} system where the information content grows because of selection. It must start with the minimum possible information, or the minimum possible <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> It also requires thermodynamically free energy that is accessible by means of its information content. Hence, for its origin, we look for the most benign circumstance or minimum entropy variations over long times with abundant free energy. The unique location for this condition is the pore space in the first few kilometers of the earth's surface. The free energy is derived from the condensed products of the chemical reactions taking place in the cooling nebula e. g. iron oxides and fixed hydrocarbon, (CH 2) 16 and the benign environment is the thermal and radiation isolation of the earth's crust. We discuss how this environment occurs naturally and universally astrophysically.

Although the Doppler shifted laser-induced fluorescence measurements are performed on argon atoms in the metastable Ar*(/sup 3 /P/sub 2 /) and resonant Ar*(/sup 3 /P/sub 1 /) states, {{it is argued that}} in the plasma jet the velocity distribution function of these Ar[4 s] atoms images the velocity distribution functions of the ground-state argon atoms.

In Jupiter and Saturn, the stratospheric para fraction is close to its tropopause value. In the stratosphere of these planets {{as well as in}} Neptune's, the para fraction presents a significant <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> This situation results from a lagged conversion between the ortho and the para states as molecular hydrogen is transported upward under the influence of turbulent eddy diffusion. In contrast, the uranian stratosphere lies close to thermodynamic equilibrium. The magnitude of the <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> appears to be anti-correlated with the amount of stratospheric aerosols. To validate this assumption, we estimate the hydrogen equilibration time with a one-dimensional diffusion model for different conversion processes in the gas phase or on aerosols. The comparison between our results and the tropospheric estimates from Conrath et al. (1998, Icarus, 135, 501 - 517) shows that paramagnetic conversion on aerosols matches the estimated tropospheric and stratospheric relaxation times in the four giant planets. In contrast, paramagnetic conversion in the gas phase can only explain the relaxation times measured in Jupiter and Saturn atmospheres. This situation provides quantitative evidence for an equilibration mechanism dominated by conversion on aerosols. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved...|$|E

Apparent activation energies were also evaluated in voltammetric and chronoamperometric experiments and were compared to those obtained under oscillatory conditions.

Specifically under oscillatory conditions an apparent activation energy of 60 +/- 3 kJ mol(- 1) and a temperature coefficient q(10) of about 2. 3 were observed.

40|$|The normal {{shock wave}} is a rarefied-gas flow in which large <b>departures</b> <b>from</b> <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> and strong {{non-linearities}} occur {{and it is}} the simplest such flow due to its one-dimensionality and the absence of solid boundaries. Because of this, both theoretical and experimental studies of the structure of normal shock waves have been used successfully in recent years to get a better understanding of such phenomena. The present work is an extension of the earlier studies to the more complicated problem of shock-wave reflection. The density distribution of a normal shock wave in argon is measured during its reflection from a heat-conducting wall using an electron beam densitometer in the GALCIT 17 -in diameter shock tube at incident Mach numbers 6. 00, 4. 00 and 2. 96. During each run a density history is obtained at a certain distance from the wall by measuring electron-beam current as a function of time. By defining a consistent zero of time for all runs at the same conditions, these histories are converted by a cross-plot to families of density profiles at different times. x-t diagrams are obtained from the density history plots, and a wall-density history is obtained from the density profiles. Measured in terms of the ideal conditions behind the incident shock wave, the distances extend from 0. 25 to 56 mean free paths from the wall and the times to 160 mean collision times after the beginning of the reflection. The results presented here give both quantitative and qualitative information about the interaction of the incident shock wave with the wall, the effects of the wall heat transfer and accommodation on the density near the wall, the formation of the reflected shock wave, its strength and trajectory on the x-t diagram, {{and the nature of the}} flow field lying between the thermal layer and the reflected shock wave at large times...|$|R

A hybrid coupled continuum-molecular approach is used to model the flow field. Due to the low pressure and high thermodynamic gradients, continuum mechanics results are doubtful, while, because of its excessive time expenses, a full molecular method is not feasible. The results of the hybrid coupled continuum-molecular approach proposed have been successfully validated against experimental data by R. Engeln et al. [Plasma Sources Sci. Technol. 10, 595 (2001) ] obtained by means of laser induced fluorescence. Two main questions are addressed: the necessity of applying a molecular approach where rarefaction effects are present in order to correctly model the flow and the demonstration of an invasion of the supersonic part of the flow by background particles. A comparison between the hybrid method and full continuum simulations demonstrates the inadequacy of the latter, due {{to the influence of}} rarefaction effects on both velocity and temperature fields.
