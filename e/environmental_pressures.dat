5|$|The Hawaiian {{monk seal}} {{has the lowest}} level of genetic {{variability}} among the 18 pinniped species, allegedly due to a population bottleneck caused by intense hunting in the 19th century. This limited genetic variability reduces the species's ability to adapt to <b>environmental</b> <b>pressures</b> and limits natural selection thus increasing their risk of extinction. Given the monk seal's small population, the effects of disease could be disastrous.|$|E
5|$|The {{system that}} would become Hurricane Alicia {{originated}} from {{the western end of}} a frontal trough that stretched from New England to the Gulf of Mexico. Satellite pictures showed a meso-scale low pressure area that had moved off the Alabama and Mississippi coasts near the trough and was possibly the precursor system to Alicia. Pressures in the Gulf of Mexico were high and stayed high during the early development stages. On August 15, a ship recorded a minimal pressure of 1015millibars (29.99inHg), when the system was upgraded into Tropical Storm Alicia. With high <b>environmental</b> <b>pressures</b> around it, Alicia remained a small system.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{of science}} have noted that, while Darwin {{considered}} the ideas in Wallace's paper to be {{essentially the same}} as his own, there were differences. Darwin emphasised competition between individuals of the same species to survive and reproduce, whereas Wallace emphasised <b>environmental</b> <b>pressures</b> on varieties and species forcing them to become adapted to their local conditions, leading populations in different locations to diverge. Some historians, notably Peter J. Bowler, have suggested the possibility that in the paper he mailed to Darwin, Wallace was not discussing selection of individual variations at all but rather group selection. However, Malcolm Kottler has shown that this notion is incorrect and Wallace was indeed discussing individual variations.|$|E

5|$|The book {{presents}} {{case histories}} {{of all the}} twin-pairs studied and the raw data from the analyses. Its last chapters put the results {{in the context of}} existing studies, and presented a new theory and model to explain the causes and continuance of the disorder. The environmental aspects the researchers checked drew on existing literature, and multiple judgments were pooled to both compare and mutually cancel differing criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia. The theory in the book was that many genes work together to dispose a person to the disorder under certain <b>environmental</b> <b>pressures.</b> The model provided no specific therapeutic insight, but was useful as a guideline for further study.|$|E
5|$|Results {{of studies}} {{comprise}} another {{third of the}} core of Schizophrenia and Genetics. The data showed that genes made a person likely to develop schizophrenia under <b>environmental</b> <b>pressures.</b> The study was not designed to find the genes responsible, but the authors hypothesized there would be several acting in tandem.Contextual elements responsible could not be identified, though some, such as an overly protective mother, birth order, natal weight, and social and economic elements were ruled out. Gottesman and Shields found roughly half of identical twins had a shared schizophrenic or non-schizophrenic status, but only one-eleventh of fraternal twins had such a shared diagnosis. MMPI scales coincided among identical twin pairs but not among fraternal twin pairs. The Object Sorting Test showed no useful relations. Those meeker than their twins were more liable to develop schizophrenia where their genes already put them at risk.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the relationship between income and the associated <b>environmental</b> <b>pressure</b> in terms of derived materials inputs and pollution levels may take an inverted-U shape, indicating a 'delinking' of <b>environmental</b> <b>pressure</b> from economic growth in relation to rising per capita incomes. The likelihood of such a relationship being persistent is discussed {{in the context of a}} simple macro model of industrial metabolism, and the possibility of 'relinking' clearly emerges. Data on specific indicators of <b>environmental</b> <b>pressure</b> (i. e., the throughput of materials, energy and the volume of transport) in 19 countries have been used to investigate patterns of delinking. The results suggest that delinking may not be persistent; already some advanced economies may be entering a new period of relinking.
