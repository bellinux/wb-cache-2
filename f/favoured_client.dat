50|$|The Uí Néill—the grandsons, or descendants, of Niall of the Nine Hostages—dominated the {{northern}} half of Ireland from the 7th century, and perhaps earlier. The various Uí Néill kingdoms, their allies, client kingdoms and subject tribes, comprised {{most of the}} province of Ulster, all of Connacht, and {{a large part of}} Leinster. Elaborate genealogies showed the descent of the various Uí Néill, while allies and <b>favoured</b> <b>clients</b> descended from Niall's brothers or other kinsmen. Along with the dominant southern kindred, the Eóganachta of Munster, all these were members of the Connachta, the descendants of Conn of the Hundred Battles. However, since Uí Néill means grandsons of Niall, the Uí Néill cannot have existed before the time of Niall's grandsons, towards the middle of the 6th century.|$|R

50|$|It is the nurse’s job to {{be aware}} of signs that {{professional}} boundaries may be crossed or have been crossed.

The complaint against him was remitted to a committee, which, after full inquiry, completely exculpated him, and the two bills, whose incompetency he demonstrated in an able paper addressed to the commission and parliament, were allowed to drop. He was also one of a parliamentary commission which prepared a report on the regulation of the judicatures, afterwards made the basis of a statute in 1695 supplementary to that of 1672, and forming the foundation of the judicial procedure in the Scottish courts for many years.|$|R

30|$|Filipino {{workers who}} manage {{multinational}} companies {{were expected to}} become patrons of their employees. In an ethnography of work relations in the textile industry in South India, De Neve (2001 : 160) finds that the authority of an employer draws from his ability to become a patron, that is to provide jobs and lend money. Patrons dispense <b>favours</b> to <b>clients</b> in return for compliance and loyalty (Carney 1989 : 43 – 45). From the pragmatic perspective of multinational employers, providing extra benefits and extending financial help to employees minimised the attrition rate and motivated employees to stay. Acting as patrons was a personal approach to the instrumental employer-employee relationship. To demonstrate this claim, I describe the experiences of Carlo, 32, and his Brazilian general manager, Rodrigo, 40, who came to Delhi in 2006 and started the India operations of a European manufacturing company. The case of Carlo and Rodrigo is illustrative {{of the way in}} which cooperation is achieved through mutually beneficial workplace relations.|$|R

40|$|The {{dissertation}} What {{to do and}} how to be reflects {{upon the}} professional skills needed by unit managers and nursing staff within the institutions of eldercare. Throughout the study, three conceptions are essential: formal education and training, professional skills, and individual competence. In order to understand the professional skills within its proper context, an activity perspective has been applied. The study is based on empirical materials, historical and present national and municipal documents, interviews with and observations of unit managers as well as questionnaires filled in by nursing staff members. A main result is the stress the respondents put on the importance of individual competence among unit managers and nursing staff members. “How to be” is more important than formal training and professional skills. To work with – and develop – individual competence therefore becomes momentous both to job activities and to education. The result shows a discrepancy between the way professional skills are discussed and the actual work performance. A lot of tasks carried out by unit managers and nursing stuff are never mentioned in connection with professional skills. The unit manager’s task is to lead both unit operations and staff work. Such responsibilities demand basic knowledge in social sciences, an overall understanding of the work activities from political management, job conditions and duties of the nursing staff. The professional skills given priority are those present in organisations and leadership. Problematic are economic and budget tasks which may sometimes cause unit managers to give up their economic responsibility, <b>favouring</b> <b>client</b> – directed over economy – directed care. The main task of the nursing staff is the care of elderly. It calls for social, caring, medical and housekeeping skills. For this one needs an upper secondary level education supplying the students with solid knowledge within social science as well as basic medicine and an overall understanding of the situation and needs of the elderly. Throughout the study, knowledge of the demented and of other mental disorders is emphasized as well as treatment of elderly persons suffering from those disorders. Units {{still have a long way}} to go before reaching the goal that every nursing staff member be given a formal education. Some municipalities already offer employees shorter nursing staff training. As to the rest, the educational development is neglected...|$|R

40|$|This article, {{based on}} a paper given at a conference {{discussing}} links between the Hebridean islands of Skye and Lewis, examines the lordship of S&# 236;ol Torcail, or the Macleods of Lewis which embraced both these islands together with parts of the adjacent Scottish mainland in the sixteenth century. The first section of the paper concentrates on the political (and dynastic) history of the Macleods of Lewis and their frequent rebellions {{in the face of}} the extension of royal control and pressure from neighbouring 'Highland' clans such as the Mackenzies of Kintail, a process which culminated in the expropriation of the Macleods and attempted plantation of Lewis (1598 - 1609) by lowland Scottish settlers. The fate of the Macleods of Lewis is discussed within the wider context of James VI &# 38; I' Highland policy, such as the Statutes of Iona, and the <b>favouring</b> of <b>client</b> clans such as the Mackenzies. The second section of the paper briefly considers the human and physical geography of the lordship of S&# 236;ol Torcail inasmuch as this can be reconstructed and the final section considers the fisheries which were, it is argued, of crucial importance in attracting outside interest to the area...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether social counselling via chat conversations could meet the criteria for a professional conversation, and how the six social workers who were interviewed felt that it had affected the profession and the clients who are seeking their help. Communication, professionality, power, roles and regions are the key topics of this study. A hermeneutic approach has not only influenced the interviews but also the content analysis that was used to encode the results. The interviews revealed that the chat conversations was a successful tool but not entirely without difficulties. The initial contact making between the client and the social worker <b>favours</b> the <b>client,</b> since she/he remains anonymous and that was the main advantage of the method. The biggest concern however was that in the anonymity it is not possible to report cases that the social worker are obligated to. The changing of forum does not necessarily affect the professionality but due to the faceless chat conversation an entire dimension of communication disappears because the loss of body language. Therefore, the traditional face-to-face conversation contains a value that is hard to replac...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} research, we examine design {{as a major}} {{contributor}} to the formation of identity. We refer to two notions of identity: one within an organisational context, and another, which exists externally among the clients. We show that these concepts are strongly linked and constitute an element of strategic performance. Furthermore, we suggest that in the cultural industries, a clear and consistent corporate identity must be shared internally between the group of employees and externally; ideally, a cultural organisation, because of its non-profit, educational, ethical, etc. status, would like to see its identity perfectly matched with that of its audience. Organisational brand identity signals what the corporation is and does. Therefore, it provides reasons to be <b>favoured</b> by <b>clients</b> and helps to build loyalty and attachment to the company. This is a deeply selective and interpretive process and one that {{plays a major role in}} strategy. In the present paper, we review key texts on identity formation in relation to design and brand strategy; we describe a case study of various museums and galleries; and finally, we arrive at a set of conclusions about the role of design in the articulation of a clear and distinctive identity for both cultural corporations and individuals interested in cultural products...|$|R

50|$|One of the Camorra's {{strategies}} to gain social prestige is political patronage. The family clans became the preferred interlocutors of local politicians and public officials, {{because of their}} grip on the community. In turn, the family bosses used their political sway to assist and protect their clients against the local authorities. Through a mixture of brute force, political status, and social leadership, the Camorra family clans imposed themselves as middlemen between the local community and bureaucrats and politicians at the national level. They granted privileges and protection, and intervened in <b>favour</b> of their <b>clients</b> {{in return for their}} silence and connivance against local authorities and the police.

Genetic counselling and testing for people with (and at risk of) familial cancer are becoming more widely available, but service providers need to address challenging issues in relation to privacy and property. As in any counselling situation, a genetic counsellor seeks to ensure that the principles of autonomy, confidentiality, beneficence, and equity operate in <b>favour</b> of the <b>client.</b> But in dealing with a familial disorder, the application of these principles to the individual must be balanced with the potential for these principles to apply to other family members.
