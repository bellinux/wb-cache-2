An inner stage, carrying the tracking antenna(s), measures the relative {{position of the}} internal free proof mass, and feeds this {{to a set of}} magnetic forcers, acting against the outer or main vehicle. As the external forces on the inner stage are low, and as the position relative to the proof mass is tightly controlled, carrier phase disturbances are greatly reduced. The arrangement lowers instantaneous accelerations. It is stressed that <b>gravity</b> <b>gradiometers</b> do not measure gradients, they measure components of an intrinsic tensor...|$|R

50|$|Gravity {{measurements}} are {{a reflection of}} the earth’s gravitational attraction, its centripetal force, tidal accelerations due to the sun, moon, and planets, and other applied forces. <b>Gravity</b> <b>gradiometers</b> measure the spatial derivatives of the gravity vector. The most frequently used and intuitive component is the vertical gravity gradient, Gzz, which represents the rate of change of vertical gravity (gz) with height (z).

The <b>gravity</b> <b>gradiometer</b> is described in the well-known textbook Gravitation by Misner, Thorne & Wheeler. The principle behind it is quite simple; getting the implementation right is tricky. Essentially, two beams are crossed over and connected with an axle through their crossing point. They are held at right angles to each other by springs. They have heavy masses at the ends of the beams, and the whole assembly spun around the common axle at high speed. The angle between the beams is measured continuously, and if it varies with a period half that of the rotation period, it means that the detector is experiencing a measurable gravitational field gradient.|$|E

Such instruments can potentially provide not only high resolution mapping of mass distribution both {{above and below}} the surface of the planet, but also temporal monitoring of its dynamical processes. These capabilities will significantly advance our knowledge of the solid Earth, the oceans, and under ground water. The underlying principle of atom-interferometry is the quantum particle-wave duality. According to quantum mechanics, atoms behave as waves, as does light.

50|$|Developing an operationally useful <b>gravity</b> <b>gradiometer</b> {{is a major}} {{technical}} challenge. One type, the SQUID Superconducting Quantum Interference Device gradiometer, {{may have}} adequate sensitivity, but it needs extreme cryogenic cooling, even if in space, a logistic nightmare. Another technique, far more operationally practical but lacking the necessary sensitivity, is the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) technique, currently using radar to measure the distance between pairs of satellites, whose orbits will change based on gravity. Substituting lasers for radar will make GRACE more sensitive, but probably not sensitive enough.|$|E

40|$|Gravity {{gradients}} are {{an effective}} method for delineating {{the extent of}} subsurface density anomalies. The change in subsurface density contrasts due to the seismic deformation gives rise to detectable gravity changes via the dilatational gravity signal or Bouguer anomaly. Solutions for the corresponding gravity gradients of these signals are developed for a vertical strike-slip fault. Gravity gradient solutions exhibit similar spatial distributions as those calculated for Coulomb stress changes, reflecting their physical relationship to the stress changes. The signals' magnitudes, {{of the order of}} 10 − 4 E, are beyond the resolution of typical exploration instruments.

40|$|Two {{existing}} <b>gravity</b> <b>gradiometers</b> {{are discussed}} {{and a single}} signal equation is developed for both instruments. Equations are derived for calculating the gradiometer signal from known spherical harmonic coefficients. The result is a signal equation in the same form as the harmonic expansion but with a "gradiometer" polynomial. Next, an integral curvefit procedure is developed for calculating the harmonic coefficients of the gravitational field from known gradiometer data. The procedure only requires calculation of a theoretical observation matrix, thus the orbit determination part of the algorithm is the rate determining step. This increases in cost as the fourth power of the maximum harmonic degree considered. Calculations using parts of the algorithm are discussed and procedures for dealing with error sources are described. Finally, {{a brief description of}} a complete gradiometer data reduction program is presented. ...|$|R

Because of their different position in the gravitational field they all experienced the gravitational acceleration of the Earth slightly differently. The three axes of the gradiometer allowed the simultaneous measurement of the five independent components of the gravity gradient tensor.|$|E
50|$|A more {{promising}} technique, although {{still in the}} laboratory, is quantum gradiometry, which {{is an extension of}} atomic clock techniques, much like those in GPS. Off-the-shelf atomic clocks measure changes in atomic waves over time rather than the spatial changes measured in a quantum <b>gravity</b> <b>gradiometer.</b> One advantage of using GRACE in satellites is that measurements can be made from a number of points over time, with a resulting improvement as seen in synthetic aperture radar and sonar.

40|$|Laser {{frequency}} {{noise is}} a dominant noise {{background for the}} detection of gravitational waves using long-baseline optical interferometry. Amelioration of this noise requires near simultaneous strain measurements on more than one interferometer baseline, necessitating, for example, more than two satellites for a space-based detector, or two interferometer arms for a ground-based detector. We describe a new detection strategy based on recent advances in optical atomic clocks and atom interferometry which can operate at long-baselines and which is immune to laser frequency noise. Laser frequency noise is suppressed because the signal arises strictly from the light propagation time between two ensembles of atoms. This new class of sensor allows sensitive gravitational wave detection with only a single baseline. This approach also has practical applications in, for example, the development of ultra-sensitive gravimeters and <b>gravity</b> <b>gradiometers.</b> Comment: 5 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

In this paper, we {{work out the}} tidal signals in non-dynamical Chern-Simons modified gravity, which could be measured by orbiting SGGs around Earth. We find that, with proper orientations of multi-axes SGGs, the tidal signals from the Chern-Simons modification can be isolated in the combined data of different axes. Furthermore, for three-axes SGGs, such combined data is the trace of the total tidal matrix, which is invariant under the rotations of SGG axes and thus free from axis pointing errors.

These components could be detected in principle by sensitive superconducting <b>gravity</b> <b>gradiometers</b> currently under development. We lay out the theoretical principles of such an experiment by using the parametrized post-Newtonian formalism to derive the locally measured Riemann tensor in an orbiting proper reference frame, in a class of metric theories of gravity that includes general relativity. A gradiometer assembly consisting of three gradiometers with axes at mutually right angles measures three diagonal components of a 3 × 3 ''tidal tensor,'' related to the Riemann tensor. We find that, by choosing a particular assembly orientation relative to the orbit and taking a sum and difference of two of the three gradiometer outputs, one can isolate the gravitomagnetic relativistic effect from the large Newtonian background.
