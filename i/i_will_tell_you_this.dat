500|$|Fieldy {{has said}} of the album [...] "Right now, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this...</b> we've done {{something}} we've never done before. Normally if we do a new Korn record, we'll normally put 12 or 13 songs and that's how many we make. This time we've made 20-plus songs, and we'll put {{the best of what}} we have on there, whatever the numbers end up being. We have so many to choose from, I think it's {{going to be a little}} extra special this time." [...] Munky later confirmed this by saying that the band completed 25 songs and 15 of them would be put on the album. Head later elaborated that musically this was Korn's best album.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> much, O'Grady: I fancy that, {{before this}} day week, you will all {{have work to}} do; {{and that it is}} likely to be hot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{will see}} you. I {{can tell you}} that. And <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> also;--that she wrote {{to you as a}} girl writes to the lover whom she does wish to see.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{should teach}} {{him to be}} a little more courteous in his {{demeanour}} to ladies; that is all. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> something else, too, about poor Will--but not now. Some other day <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> something of your cousin Will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{may call}} it superstition," [...] Mabane continued. [...] "Everything {{of the sort}} which an ignorant man cannot {{understand}} he calls superstition. But if <b>you</b> like, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> something which is surely going to happen. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what <b>I</b> have seen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will find}} you companions, women {{discreet}} and skilled. And as to where <b>you</b> shall go, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> You shall go upon an embassy to the Prince Hafela." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I went {{to leave}} some roses for him," [...] Lucille answered. [...] "And {{if you would}} like to know it, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this.</b> I left my card tied to them with a message for him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And you'll {{be glad to}} hear, Tatham writes me, that he {{has sold}} three of my fields at Fairoaks to the Railroad Company, at a great figure. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this,</b> and more when we meet; and am always your affectionate,--A. P." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} said so. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> truth, though perhaps you {{will say it}} is not feminine. I would fain marry some one. To be as I {{have been for the}} last two years is not a happy condition." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. ALLONBY. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{when you}} have kissed the Puritan.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, if {{you would}} really like to hear, Frank, as a proof of my {{confidence}} and trust, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>will</b> remember that <b>I</b> had not seen you at the time.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That {{is exactly}} what I thought. Well, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this.</b> Use your warrant: Arrest Mr. Inglethorp. But it will bring you no kudos--the case against him will be {{dismissed}} at once! Comme ca!" [...] And he snapped his fingers expressively.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "I {{was sure}} of it. Yet you have done well to tell me. Now <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this.</b> Ughtred of Tyrnaus before he had been King an hour sent to London to summon here an American woman {{with whom he had}} been--on the best terms in London." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will go {{your own}} way," [...] he said. [...] "Now {{that you have}} chosen <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this.</b> I am glad. Yes, let Duson bring wine. I will drink to your health and to your success. There {{have been times when}} men have {{performed}} miracles. I shall drink to that miracle." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> later of a {{piece of}} night work not without merit.|$|R
60|$|And now <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> how my {{love for}} Lucia {{was the cause of}} one of the most terrible of all the {{wonderful}} adventures which have ever befallen me, and how it was that I came to lose the top of my right ear. You have often asked me why it was missing. To-night for the first time <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b>|$|R
60|$|If I {{hear any}} more of his cunning tricks, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> of them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your judgment, Mr. Trent," [...] she {{answered}} quietly, [...] "is of no importance to me! It does not interest me in any way. But <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this.</b> If I {{did not disclose}} myself, it was because I distrusted you. I {{wanted to know the}} truth, and I set myself to find it out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I may {{not tell}} you where I am going or why," [...] I answered. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this,</b> Lady Angela. I shall come back, and as you {{have come to see}} me to-night, so shall I come to you before long. If you will trust me I will prove myself worthy of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do," [...] he answered. [...] "I {{know that}} a paper was stolen by your cousin, and handed over to a person whom we will not name, but {{who is now in}} Europe. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> much--I am going across so as {{to keep in touch with}} that person. It seems odd that you, who are {{involved}} in the same affair, should be going over by the same steamer." ...|$|E
60|$|But how did Georgie Griggs {{get rid of}} his boggart? That <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b>|$|R
60|$|MRS. ALLONBY. Well, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> if you solemnly {{promise to}} tell {{everybody}} else.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{just what}} <b>I</b> <b>will</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> One thing <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> though, for it may help to quench any vain hopes on your part; and that is, the reason which she gives for not marrying him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, my lad, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> {{much for}} the {{gratification}} of yourself and friends: When it comes, if it ever does, that I am convinced, {{because of lack of}} food, ammunition, or any other contingency, that we cannot hold the fort, I will lead as many of the garrison as choose to follow me in an attempt to cut our way through the enemy's lines. I, like you, prefer to die fighting, rather than at the stake." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Monsieur," [...] she said, [...] "if {{you keep}} the child you make enemies--very {{powerful}} enemies. It is long since I lived in the world, but I think that the times have not changed very much. Of the child's parentage I may not tell you, but as I hope for salvation <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this.</b> It will be better for you, and better for the child, that she comes back here, even to embrace what you have called the living death." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And yet," [...] I interrupted, [...] "I am {{anxious for}} an {{interview}} with the Prime Minister. I am afraid I cannot tell you very much, Gilbert, but <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this.</b> Some rather important information has come into my possession in a very curious fashion. I conceive it to be my duty to pass it on to the government of this country. Lord Polloch can decide {{whether or not it is}} of any real value. It is for this purpose that I am seeking this interview with him. I tell you this much in confidence. I cannot tell you more." ...|$|E
60|$|PHOEBE. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> (But his {{confidence}} awes her.) What faith {{you have in}} her.|$|R
60|$|Mask. If {{you will}} swear on your honour {{to be very}} secret, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, grandfather, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{what has}} {{occurred}} to me. <b>I</b> know it <b>will</b> appear a hideously unjust suspicion to <b>you,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> once for all, {{and we will}} not recur to the subject again; God knows I may be wronging him cruelly, but the wrong would be no greater than that which has been done to Frank if he is really innocent.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, that is {{not what}} I meant," [...] she interrupted. [...] "I am sure that you will be offered the post, and I am sure that you will not {{hesitate}} to accept it. But nevertheless I think that it will bring with it great disappointments. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this.</b> Already three young men whom I knew very well have held this post, and each in turn has been dismissed. They have lost the confidence of their employers, and though each, I believe, was ambitious and meant to make a career, they have now a black mark against their name." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not sure, my {{very simple}} conspirator," [...] she said, [...] "whether I will imitate your frankness. You see, you have blundered into a {{somewhat}} more important matter than {{you have any idea}} of. But <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this,</b> if you like. You may call that place a prison, or any hard names you please--yet it is destined to be Isobel's home. Not only that, but it is her only chance. I am putting you on your guard, you see, but I do not think that it matters. You are fighting against hopeless odds, and if by any chance you should succeed, your success would be the most terrible thing which could happen to Isobel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{something}}, after all," [...] she declared, [...] "and let me {{tell you}} this, my friend," [...] she added, leaning over. [...] "You have been frank with me. You have told me that you hated my sex, that you distrusted us all. Very well, I will share your frankness. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this.</b> Neither am I any friend of your sex. I, too, have my grievance. I, too, have something in my heart of which I cannot speak, which, when I think of it, makes me hate every male creature that walks the earth. Perhaps with that in my heart and what you have in yours, we may meet and pass and meet again and pass, and do one another no harm. Is that finished?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> You are so {{good and}} so true, and so excellent,--such a dear, dear, dear friend, that <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> everything, so that you may read my heart. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> as <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> mamma,--you and her and no one else;--for you are the choice friend of my heart. I cannot be your wife because of the love I bear for another man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good--bye, Piero," [...] she said, presently, {{setting down}} the basket. [...] "I {{promise not to}} thank you if you finish the {{portrait}} soon and well <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> you were bound {{to do it for}} your own credit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me {{whom you}} go with, and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what you are," [...] says the proverb. [...] "Show me your dwelling, and I shall see your character," [...] say I.|$|R
