It is important for an aircraft to have an ejection seat in case the plane meets an accident in a battle or during test flight and the pilot has to bail out to save his or her life. The mechanism involves lifting of the pilot to a safe distance away from the aircraft and then deploying the parachute. As there is increase in air traffic, this ejection system provides additional safety measures {{to the life of}} passengers. By this method along with the pilot, the crew members and the passengers can be saved. This ejection system consists of a specially made <b>ejector</b> <b>pad,</b> track system and parachute. The ejection system is governed by a timing sensor which ensures that the movement of the passenger seat take place in equal interval of time to avoid collision between two consecutive seats. Index Terms- Bail, <b>ejector</b> <b>pad,</b> track system, ejection, hydraulic, propulsion, stability. ...|$|E

One of the main drawbacks of the process is the tendency of the tools to be damaged during part ejection 1. At De Montfort University a successful AIM™ moulding cycle has been developed in which simple shapes from polypropylene are produced and the ejection forces required are measured. Two different ejection methods are used; one uses conventional ejector pins and the other uses a conformal <b>ejector</b> <b>pad.</b> The tool surface roughness is measured before and after moulding to observe any changes caused by ejection. Results show that ejector pins require a lower ejection force than a conformal <b>ejector</b> <b>pad</b> and this may contribute to longer tool life for the AIM™ process. Possible reasons for the results are discussed along with recommendations for further work...|$|E
