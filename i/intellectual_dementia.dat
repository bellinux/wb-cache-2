40|$|Abstract Background People with an {{intellectual}} disability often require carers {{to provide assistance}} in their basic living needs {{and to help them}} achieve the best quality of life possible. The increased prevalence of dementia in people with {{an intellectual}} disability over recent years has prioritised the importance of research into the impact this has had on people with an <b>intellectual</b> disability with <b>dementia,</b> their carers, and their support services. There has been a lack of qualitative studies investigating the experiences of carers for people with an <b>intellectual</b> disability and <b>dementia</b> and their perceptions of services that support them to carry out their role. These carers fulfil an important need within the community and this study explored family and paid carers’ experiences of caring for people who have an <b>intellectual</b> disability with <b>dementia.</b> Method This paper describes a qualitative study that used semistructured interviews to investigate both paid and family carer’s experiences of caring for people with an <b>intellectual</b> disability with <b>dementia.</b> Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 12 carers and the resulting data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results The analysis generated 9 meta-themes including a carer’s identity, transitions in the carer experience, self-care, difficulties in caring, changes to services, recommendations for change, barriers to accessing carer support, sources of support and resources, and sharing carers’ best practice. Conclusions The implications of the results are discussed and recommendations for future research are provided...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Post {{diagnostic}} support (PDS) has varied definitions within mainstream dementia {{services and}} different {{health and social}} care organizations, encompassing a range of supports that are offered to adults once diagnosed with dementia until death.   Method: An international summit on <b>intellectual</b> disability and <b>dementia</b> held in Glasgow, Scotland in 2016 identified how PDS applies to adults with an <b>intellectual</b> disability and <b>dementia.</b> The Summit proposed a model that encompassed seven focal areas: post-diagnostic counseling; psychological and medical surveillance; periodic reviews and adjustments to the dementia care plan; early identification of behaviour and psychological symptoms; reviews of care practices and supports for advanced dementia and end of life; supports to carers/ support staff; and evaluation of quality of life. It also explored current practices in providing PDS in intellectual disability services.   Results: The Summit concluded that although there is limited research evidence for pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions for people with <b>intellectual</b> disability and <b>dementia,</b> viable resources and guidelines describe practical approaches drawn from clinical practice. Post diagnostic support is essential, and the model components {{in place for the}} general population, and proposed here for use within the intellectual disability field, need to be individualized and adapted to the person’s needs as dementia progresses.   Conclusions: Recommendations for future research include examining the prevalence and nature of behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPSD) in adults with an intellectual disability who develop dementia, the effectiveness of different non-pharmacological interventions, the interaction between pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, and the utility of different models of support...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into three sections. The first section {{comprises}} a literature review, which aimed to understand the experiences of staff in supporting clients with intellectual disabilities with issues of death, dying, and bereavement. A metasynthesis was conducted to review 13 papers meeting the inclusion criteria. Three themes were developed: (1) Talking about death is hard: Negotiating the uncertainty in death, dying, and bereavement; (2) The commitment to promoting a “good death”; and (3) The grief behind the professional mask. An overarching theme, “A cautious silence: The taboo of death,” was also developed. The taboo culture surrounding death in intellectual disability services is discussed in relation to relevant literature, and clinical recommendations are offered. The second section, a research paper, explores the experiences of ten paid staff who have supported a person with an <b>intellectual</b> disability and <b>dementia</b> within a supported living setting. An interpretative phenomenological analysis was used. Four themes were developed: (1) The value of the pre-existing relationship to paid staff as dementia progresses; (2) Finding ways to connect when reciprocity has gone; (3) Resisting dementia “creeping in” and taking control; and (4) The stronger the pre-existing relationship, the greater the emotional cost of dementia. The findings support previous research, suggesting that intellectual disability services are well-placed to support people with <b>intellectual</b> disabilities with <b>dementia,</b> due to staff’s in-depth knowledge and well-established relationships. However, the findings also highlighted the emotional cost of this role to staff. Recommendations for clinical practice and ideas for further research have been offered.

50|$|MELAS is a {{condition}} that affects many of the body's systems, particularly the brain and nervous system (encephalo-) and muscles (myopathy). In most cases, the {{signs and symptoms of}} this disorder appear in childhood following a period of normal development. Early symptoms may include muscle weakness and pain, recurrent headaches, loss of appetite, vomiting, and seizures. Most affected individuals experience stroke-like episodes beginning before age 40. These episodes often involve temporary muscle weakness {{on one side of the}} body (hemiparesis), altered consciousness, vision abnormalities, seizures, and severe headaches resembling migraines. Repeated stroke-like episodes can progressively damage the brain, leading to vision loss, problems with movement, and a loss of <b>intellectual</b> function (<b>dementia).</b> The stroke-like episodes can be mis-diagnosed as epilepsy by a doctor not aware of the MELAS condition.|$|R
50|$|Delirium may be {{difficult}} to diagnose without the proper establishment of a person's usual mental function. Without careful assessment and history, delirium can easily be confused with a number of psychiatric disorders or long term organic brain syndromes, because many of the signs and symptoms of delirium are conditions also present in dementia, depression, and psychosis.

Such studies, however, {{have generally been}} conducted using disparate methodologies which precludes generalization and reproducibility. OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the practical applicability of measurement devices for studies investigating non-image-forming effects of luminous radiation, specifically for people with <b>intellectual</b> disabilities or <b>dementia.</b> METHODS: In three experiments, ten cognitive impaired people and thirty-nine unaffected subjects participated by wearing one or more portable devices. Six devices were assessed in total. Measurement data was accompanied with user experiences obtained from questionnaires, interviews and observations in order to assess the devices on practical and comfort issues. RESULTS: On average, the devices worn by the cognitive impaired subjects were not experienced as annoying or irritating. No significant differences are found between genders and for one of the portable devices significantly less annoyance was reported by the cognitive impaired participants compared to the unaffected group of participants. INNOVATIVE SOLUTION: The three phases of the research process in towards measuring personal luminous exposures are: selection of the most suitable portable device, application of the assessment method, and the application of the device in the (pilot) study. CONCLUSIONS: However, the findings of this study suggest that inaccuracies potentially caused by practical and comfort issues associated with the portable devices need to be considered.

40|$|It is {{necessary}} to assess the <b>intellectual</b> functioning of <b>dementia</b> patients. However, psychometric instruments such as the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - revised (WAIS-R) are often too demanding for dementia patients, precluding its utility. Clinicians and researchers have indirectly estimated a dementia patient's IQ from the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). This measure is an eleven item screen instrument of global cognitive functioning. Fairly accurate estimates of IQ have been predicted using the MMSE total score. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to determine if it is possible to more accurately predict intellectual functioning when the individual MMSE items were used to predict Full Scale, Verbal, and Performance IQ using multiple regression analyses. Forty elderly dementia patients were administered both the MMSE and the WAIS-R. The MMSE total score was entered into a simple linear regression to predict FSIQ. In addition, the eleven item scores of the MMSE were entered into separate stepwise regressions to predict FSIQ, VIQ, and PIQ. The increment in the amount of variance accounted for in the FSIQ between the simple and multiple regression equations were evaluated for statistical significance. The results of these investigations revealed that while the multiple regression equations using MMSE item scores predicted a significant amount of the variance in IQ, they were not statistically superior to using the MMSE total score alone. The MMSE total score was found to account for 76. 2 % of the variance in Full Scale IQ. The MMSE items that were found to add significantly to the variance in intellectual level accounted for 80. 9 %, 75. 1 %, and 73. 4 % of FSIQ, VIQ, and PIQ respectively. The results of the present study replicated other research that found the MMSE total score to accurately predict <b>intellectual</b> functioning in <b>dementia</b> patients.

40|$|The {{involvement}} {{of mental health}} service users and their caregivers in health system policy and planning, service monitoring and research can contribute to mental health system strengthening, but as yet there have been very few efforts {{to do so in}} low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods This systematic review examined the evidence and experience of service user and caregiver involvement in mental health system strengthening, as well as models of best practice for evaluation of capacity-building activities that facilitate their greater participation. Both the peer-reviewed and the grey literature were included in the review, which were identified through database searches (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Knowledge, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, LILACS, SciELO, Google Scholar and Cochrane), as well as hand-searching of reference lists and the internet, and a snowballing process of contacting experts active in the area. This review included any kind of study design that described or evaluated service user, family or caregiver (though not community) involvement in LMICs (including service users with <b>intellectual</b> disabilities, <b>dementia,</b> or child and adolescent mental health problems) and that were relevant to mental health system strengthening across five categories. Data were extracted and summarised as a narrative review. Results Twenty papers matched the inclusion criteria. Overall, the review found that although there were examples of service user and caregiver involvement in mental health system strengthening in numerous countries, {{there was a lack of}} high-quality research and a weak evidence base for the work that was being conducted across countries. However, there was some emerging research on the development of policies and strategies, including advocacy work, and to a lesser extent the development of services, service monitoring and evaluation, with most service user involvement having taken place within advocacy and service delivery. Research was scarce within the other health system strengthening areas. Conclusions Further research on service user and caregiver involvement in mental health system strengthening in LMICs is recommended, in particular research that includes more rigorous evaluation.

40|$|A {{working group}} of the 2016 International Summit on <b>Intellectual</b> Disability and <b>Dementia</b> was charged to examine the {{terminology}} used to define and report on dementia in publications related to intellectual disability (ID). A review of related publications showed mixed uses of terms associated with dementia or causative diseases. As with dementia research in the non-ID population, language related to dementia in the ID field often lacks precision and {{could lead to a}} misunderstanding of the condition(s) under discussion; an increasingly crucial issue given the increased global attention dementia is receiving in that field. Most articles related to ID and dementia reporting clinical or medical research generally provide a structured definition of dementia or related terms; social care articles tend toward term use without definition.

40|$|Objective: Numbers {{of people}} dying with {{cognitive}} impairment (<b>intellectual</b> disability (ID), <b>dementia</b> or delirium) are increasing. We aimed {{to examine a}} range of European national palliative care guidelines to determine if, and how well, pain detection and management for people dying with impaired cognition are covered. Methods: Questionnaires were sent to 14 country representatives of the European Pain and Impaired Cognition (PAIC) network who identified key national palliative care guidelines. Data was collected on guideline content: inclusion of advice on pain management, whether cognitively impaired populations were mentioned, assessment tools and management strategies recommended. Quality of guideline development was assessed with the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument. Results: 11 countries identified palliative care guidelines, 10 of which mentioned pain management in general. Of these, seven mentioned cognitive impairment (3 dementia, 2 ID and 4 delirium). Half of guidelines recommended the use of pain tools for people with cognitive impairment; recommended tools were not all validated for the target populations. Guidelines from the UK, the Netherlands and Finland included most information on pain management and detection in impaired cognition. Guidelines from Iceland, Norway and Spain scored most highly on AGREE rating in terms of developmental quality. Conclusions: European national palliative care guidelines may not {{meet the needs of}} the growing population of people dying with cognitive impairment. New guidelines should consider suggesting the use of observational pain tools for people with cognitive impairment.

40|$|As life {{expectancy}} increases {{for persons with}} an intellectual disability, concerns have been raised {{that there will be}} an increased demand for health or social services, particularly to address the challenges posed by the problems of dementia. To plan services for people with an intellectual disability who might experience the consequences of aging, an important first step is to obtain epidemiological data on the prevalence of dementia in this vulnerable population. This study aimed to investigate the dementia prevalence rate and its associated demographical factors in adults with an intellectual disability in Taiwan. A national survey was conducted to recruit 460 community residents of at least 45 years of age with an <b>intellectual</b> disability. The <b>Dementia</b> Screening Questionnaire for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (DSQIID) was administered to caregivers to determine the symptoms of dementia in adults with an intellectual disability. The results indicated that 16. 5 % of the adults with an intellectual disability might have dementia conditions (DSQIID score 3 20). After controlling for other factors in a multiple logistic regression analysis, the older adults with intellectual disability (355 vs. 45 - 54, OR = 2. 594, 95 % CI = 1. 438 - 4. 679) and those individuals with a comorbid diagnosis of mental illness or neurological disease (with vs. without, OR = 2. 826, 95 % CI = 1. 593 - 5. 012) had a higher risk of dementia than their counterparts.

40|$|The International Summit on <b>Intellectual</b> Disability and <b>Dementia</b> held in Scotland in 2016 {{covered a}} range of issues related to <b>dementia</b> and <b>intellectual</b> disability, {{including}} the dearth of personal reflections of persons with intellectual disability affected by dementia. This paper reflects on this deficiency and explores some of the personal perspectives gleaned from the literature, from Summit attendees, and from the experiences of persons with intellectual disability recorded or scribed in advance of the two-day Summit meeting. Omission of the perspectives of persons with intellectual disability in both policy and practice limits understanding of the experience of dementia. It leads to an overreliance on proxy reporting; something considered by the Summit to be a backwards step in person-centred work. The Summit recognised that the perspectives of persons with intellectual disability must be considered whenever interventions and supports are discussed with planning required at an earlier stage for advance directives that guide medical treatment, and for advice or counselling around relationships, the continuity of social networks, and when securing dementia-friendly housing. Systemic recommendations included reinforcing the value of the involvement of persons with intellectual disability in (a) research alongside removing barriers to inclusion posed by institutional/ethics review boards, (b) planning groups that establish services and supports for dementia, and (c) peer support efforts that help adults with intellectual disability who are affected by dementia (either directly or indirectly). Practice recommendations included (a) valuing personal perspectives in decision-making, (b) enabling peer-to-peer support models, (c) supporting choice in community dwelling arrangements, and (d) wider availability of materials for persons with intellectual disability that would promote understanding of dementia...|$|R
40|$|Amongst {{the varied}} symptomology of {{multiple}} sclerosis {{is to be}} fo und the alteration of higher functions (cognitive deficit), which has considerable repercussions {{on the quality of}} life of patients. The old descriptions of the disease rarely differentiate cognitive affectation from the more general category of “mental symptoms”, which also includes a broad range of affective disorders. Towards 1960 neuropsychological tests began to be employed, and it was from the 1970 s onwards that a clear distinction was drawn between deterioration of the higher functions and psycho-affective aspects in the disease. The pattern of cognitive deterioration in patients with multiple sclerosis is not uniform. During the initial phases of the disease it is, in general, light and it has an insidious start, although inter-individual variability is wide, depending on the predominant pathological alterations in the lesions and on their number and localisation. In more severe cases, it is possible to include within the debatable term of subcortical <b>dementia,</b> <b>intellectual</b> slowness, problems of attention, alterations in abstract reasoning, shortcomings in the resolution of problems and memory dysfunction. It is an almost invariable complication of the advanced stages of the disease, since the lesions characterised by axonal loss affect broad areas of white matter, which determines the deafferentation of several areas of cortical association. There does not appear to be any correlation between cognitive deterioration and the variables of the disease considered in an independent way, such as demographic data, clinical course, alterations of mood, consumption of medicines or fatigue. Although, evidently, the disease’s progressive secondary forms of greater duration and the accumulation of lesions are what present the greatest deterioration. With present-day techniques of neuroimaging it has been possible to show a correlation between cognitive deterioration and the existence of an increase in ventricular size, periventricular lesions and atrophy of the callous body...|$|R
40|$|Consumer {{involvement}} or {{patient and}} public involvement (PPI) in health research is a UK policy imperative and {{a prerequisite for}} many funders. PPI in research is defined as research carried out with or being {{carried out by the}} public (or service users), rather than research on patients and public as subjects or participants. Despite the clear policy driver, there is relatively little empirical evidence on the extent, processes and impact of user involvement in research. This paper aims to add to the international evidence base on PPI in research by providing a key overview of current trends and impacts. In order to understand the current extent and variation of PPI in research, a scoping exercise and survey were carried out on selected UK studies. Six research topic areas (cystic fibrosis, diabetes, arthritis, <b>dementia,</b> <b>intellectual</b> and developmental disabilities, and public health) were selected to ensure a range of designs, study populations and histories of PPI in research. A total of 838 studies (non-commercial studies and not older than 2 years) were contacted. The response rate for the scoping was 38 % and the survey 28 %. In the scoping, 51 % of studies had some evidence of PPI and in the survey 79 %. The most common PPI activity was steering committee membership and reviewing patient information leaflets. There appeared to be some blurred roles with patients participating as research subjects as well as carrying out patient involvement roles. A major finding was the limited amount of available information about PPI in publicly accessible research documents. We suggest that the invisibility of this type of involvement and the lack of routinely collected information about PPI results in a lack of shared understanding of what optimal PPI in a study should look like, with important implications for practice. Furthermore, without a framework to review PPI {{it is difficult to know}} if different approaches to PPI have a different impact on key outcomes of the researc...|$|R
