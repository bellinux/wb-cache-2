40|$|Mentor: Muir D. EatonFor centuries {{hunters have}} been using {{waterfowl}} decoys {{in an attempt to}} attract more birds for harvest, yet what makes a decoy effective is relatively unstudied. More recently, new paint technology has introduced decoy colors that aim to look more like real <b>duck</b> <b>feather</b> colors due to the addition of UV-reflecting properties. This stems from research showing that birds have the ability to see UV reflectance due to a fourth type of cone cell sensitive from 300 - 410 nm (humans are blind to UV wavelengths, having only three cone cells, none sensitive to UV), and that duck feathers of many colors reflect UV light. We assessed the efficacy of decoys painted with ‘UV-colors’ in two ways: 1) modeling from an avian visual perspective the color differences between UV-paint colors, traditional paint colors, and real duck plumage colors, and 2) comparing hunter harvest success using UV-painted decoys and traditionally painted decoys. We found that UV-painted decoys are as visually different as traditionally painted decoys compared to real feather colors from the visual perspective of a duck. Additionally, success by hunters was similar using both types of decoys, suggesting that use of UV-painted decoys does not result in higher waterfowl harvest rates compared to use of traditionally painted decoys.

40|$|Introduction Observational studies report inverse {{associations}} between {{the use of}} feather upper bedding (pillow and/or quilt) and asthma symptoms but there is no randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence assessing the role of feather upper bedding as a secondary prevention measure. Objective To determine whether, among children not using feather upper bedding, a new feather pillow and feather quilt reduces asthma severity among house dust mite (HDM) sensitised children with asthma over a 1 -year period compared with standard dust mite avoidance advice, and giving children a new mite-occlusive mattress cover. Design RCT. Setting The Calvary Hospital in the Australian Capital Territory and the Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, New South Wales. Patients 197 children with HDM sensitisation and moderate to severe asthma. Intervention New upper bedding <b>duck</b> <b>feather</b> pillow and quilt and a mite-occlusive mattress cover (feather) versus standard care and a mite-occlusive mattress cover (standard). Main outcome measures The proportion of children reporting four or more episodes of wheeze in the past year; an episode of speech-limiting wheeze; or one or more episodes of sleep disturbance caused by wheezing; and spirometry with challenge testing. Statistical analysis included multiple logistic and linear regression. Results No differences between groups were found for primary end points - frequent wheeze (OR 1. 51, 95 % CI 0. 83 to 2. 76, p= 0. 17), speech-limiting wheeze (OR 0. 70, 95 % CI 0. 32 to 1. 48, p= 0. 35), sleep disturbed because of wheezing (OR 1. 17, 95 % CI 0. 64 to 2. 13, p= 0. 61) or for any secondary end points. Secondary analyses indicated the intervention reduced the risk of sleep being disturbed because of wheezing and severe wheeze to a greater extent for children who slept supine. Conclusion No differences in respiratory symptoms or lung function were observed 1 year after children with moderate-severe asthma and HDM sensitisation were given a mite-occlusive mattress cover and then received either feather upper bedding (pillow and quilt) or standard bedding care...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Despite the {{importance}} of movement ecology studies, the field faces a prevailing challenge of methodological limitations in tracking individual organisms. This research investigated {{the utility of the}} stable isotope technique to trace movements of ducks in southern Africa. I sampled and analysed feathers of ten duck species for stable isotope proportions of Carbon (δ 13 C), Nitrogen (δ 15 N) and Hydrogen (δD), from five wetlands (Strandfontein and Barberspan in South Africa, the Manyame catchment in Zimbabwe, Lake Chuali in Mozambique, and Lake Ngami in Botswana) as test cases. Sampling was carried out at different seasons to account for seasonal isotope signature variations. Isotope signatures of feathers grown at different moulting locations were compared to test whether southern Africa shows stable isotope spatial patterns (distinct isotopic regions). Feathers grown at different life-phases were compared to test whether different sites had been used and if more mobile species showed more and stronger isotope distinctions. Finally, growing flight feathers grown at moulting locations were compared across species to query how much information on diet and foraging behaviour can be inferred from southern African <b>duck</b> <b>feather</b> stable isotopes. Feather isotope signatures were distinct by site in {{at least one of the}} tested isotopes, for the majority of ducks tested. Strandfontein had more and stronger distinctions of isotope signatures between feathers grown at different life phases. This site is the closest to the sea and most likely to have marine-influenced isotope signatures especially in δ 15 N, it falls within the Mediterranean climatic conditions experiencing winter rainfall unlike all the other sites. Vegetation compositions (C 3 and C 4 plant distributions) therefore vary across sites influencing δ 13 C patterns. More mobile species (only Egyptian Goose Alopochen aegyptiacus from Strandfontein, and Cape Shoveler Anas smithii from Barberspan; determined by mobility scores from other studies) had more and stronger distinctions between flight and body feathers. All the other species did not comply with mobility scores. They showed weaker and fewer tissue signature distinctions than their mobility scores suggested. There were high isotopic signature overlaps in δ 13 C and δ 15 N across and within feeding guilds at each moulting site implying dietary overlaps during moulting. More overlaps occurred during the dry seasons (summer in Strandfontein and winter in Lake Chuali, Manyame catchment site, and Lake Ngami). Higher isotopic variances (higher dietary flexibility) were associated with isotope signature divergence to mobility scores especially in Cape Teals and Yellow-billed Ducks. The isotope technique is flawed with uncontrollable sources of variation which potentially confound movement inferences. It is best used when accompanied by conventional methods to detect and counter against species specific biology and dietary behaviour imposed biases in tissue isotope signatures. Further research on how species specific biological processes affect the reflection of spatial patterns of isotopes in feathers is recommended. Multi-isotope time explicit approaches and trace element analysis were also recommended. Scientists should be wary about basing management strategies or building theory about movement patterns of species based on the technique at least in stochastic environments such as southern Africa. My results provide empirical evidence that the technique is unreliable at this scale of analysis. In particular, the majority of ducks in this region are not good candidates for use of isotopic signatures in distinguishing movement patterns of southern African ducks. 498...|$|E

Photonic crystals {{are essential}} part of the integrated systems which require manipulation of light in a manner that all-optical polarization and re ection properties are completely calibrated to necessary levels. However, beyond scienti c development of photonic crystals, biological systems also provided inspiration for the eld since they perfected the mechanisms in terms of coloration over millions of years. In addition, natural samples are also observed to serve and function for more than single purpose, and this further illuminates the technological designs so as to develop multifunctional structures. Anas Platyrhynchos L. (mallard) is one of the natural examples and detailed investigations yield that its neck feathers have structural coloration, iridescence and hydrophobicity. Being inspired form mallard duck, two-dimensional photonic crystal bers are produced to imitate coloration and surface architecture. The fabrication is established by iterative size reduction technique which, as a top-down method, enables design of nano-scale materials from macro-scale structures. To accurately imitate <b>duck</b> <b>feathers,</b> polycarbonate (PC) and polyvinyldi uoride (PVDF), are characterized and selected for their thermal compatibility and dielectric properties among number of polymers. Produced 2 D photonic crystal bers have been demonstrated to re ect color of green like <b>duck</b> <b>feathers,</b> and also shown to have iridescence by optical means. Besides single coloration, all colors of visible spectrum are also obtained to attest potential applicability of fabrication technique and produced bers. It is also substantiated that all colors can be obtained in a single ber by tapering a thick ber. In addition, last but not least, 2 D photonic crystal bers are carefully designed to have surface roughness which promoted hydrophobic feature of PVDF and provided better hydrophobicity than natural counterparts. Manufactured structures are also the rst demonstration for production of all-polymer two dimensional photonic crystal bers which may be used in textile or ltering technologies. Doğan, TamerM.

40|$|Human {{transport}} and active dispersal of the red-swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) contribute to its rapid spread. However, some small aquatic organisms can be transported by birds. We made two hypotheses related to waterbird-mediated passive dispersal of juvenile crayfish. The first is that, depending on water depth, recently hatched crayfish can attach to ducks, initiating passive external transport (i. e., ectozoochory). The {{second is that}} recently-hatched crayfish can survive bird flight, being affected by crayfish features, flight distance, and environmental conditions. A first experiment tested the attachment of juvenile crayfish to ducks at different water depths by using a freshly dead duck and tanks with crayfish. Another set of three experiments tested crayfish survival during air transportation. To simulate bird flight, we first used a vehicle moving at bird flight speed, and we then used trained pigeons. Several flight distances, environmental conditions and crayfish sizes were tested. Our results showed that juvenile crayfish were capable of clinging to <b>duck</b> <b>feathers</b> and were transported when ducks {{were removed from the}} water.
