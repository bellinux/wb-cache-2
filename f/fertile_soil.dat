5|$|The English {{county of}} Buckinghamshire is {{bisected}} by the Chiltern Hills, which rise sharply and cross the county from northeast to southwest. Although the <b>fertile</b> <b>soil</b> and good drainage of the Chilterns provides ideal conditions for farming, the steep hills historically made travelling difficult. Few sizeable settlements developed in Buckinghamshire, and what roads existed were of poor quality.|$|E

5|$|Within-crop diversity, a {{specific}} crop {{can result from}} various growing conditions, for example a crop growing in nutrient-poor soil {{is likely to have}} stunted growth than a crop growing in more <b>fertile</b> <b>soil.</b> The availability of water, soil pH level, and temperature similarly influence crop growth.|$|E
5|$|A {{combination}} of favorable geographical features {{contributed to the}} success of ancient Egyptian culture, the most important of which was the rich <b>fertile</b> <b>soil</b> resulting from annual inundations of the Nile River. The ancient Egyptians were thus able to produce an abundance of food, allowing the population to devote more time and resources to cultural, technological, and artistic pursuits. Land management was crucial in ancient Egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned.|$|E
5|$|By 7,000 BC, sowing and {{harvesting}} reached the <b>fertile</b> <b>soil</b> of Mesopotamia, where Sumerians systematized it and scaled it up. By 8,000 BC, farming was entrenched {{on the banks}} of the River Nile. About this time, agriculture was developed independently in the Far East, probably in China, with rice rather than wheat as the primary crop. Maize was domesticated from the wild grass teosinte in West Mexico by 6,700 BC.|$|E

5|$|Large {{parts of}} Zimbabwe were once covered by forests with {{abundant}} wildlife. Deforestation and poaching {{has reduced the}} amount of wildlife. Woodland degradation and deforestation, due to population growth, urban expansion and lack of fuel, are major concerns and have led to erosion and land degradation which diminish the amount of <b>fertile</b> <b>soil.</b> Local farmers have also been criticised by environmentalists for burning off vegetation to heat their tobacco barns.|$|E
5|$|Geologically {{the summit}} of the fell forms part of the Deepdale Formation, (principally volcaniclastic sandstone) {{underlain}} by the dacitic lapilli-tuff of the Helvellyn Formation. The geology of much of the Lake District is the Borrowdale Volcanic Group, of which Nethermost Pike is part, and is late Ordovician in age. The eastern cliffs of the range, including those of Nethermost Pike, are rich in base minerals. When these rocks weather they form areas of <b>fertile</b> <b>soil,</b> which together with the area's inaccessibility and climate provide suitable conditions for plants of biological importance.|$|E
5|$|The {{island of}} Lismore lies in Loch Linnhe, north east of Mull, in the Argyll and Bute council area. It is 15 km long and about 2 km wide, and {{oriented}} from SW to NE, roughly {{parallel to the}} Great Glen Fault. To the east is an arm of Loch Linnhe known as the Lynn of Lorn. Composed almost entirely of Dalradian limestone with interbedded black slate, Lismore has <b>fertile</b> <b>soil</b> and an abundance of trees and shrubs including ash and sycamore. The topography consists of sheltered furrows of land between raised areas that run longitudinally up the island's spine.|$|E

5|$|Eastern South Dakota is {{generally}} wetter and features lower topography than {{the western part}} of the state. Smaller geographic regions of this area include the Coteau des Prairies, the Dissected Till Plains, and the James River Valley. The Coteau des Prairies is a higher region bordered on the east by the Minnesota River Valley and on the west by the James River Basin. Numerous glacial lakes cover the Coteau, and it is largely drained by the Big Sioux River, a tributary of the Missouri. Further to the west, the James River Basin is mostly low, flat, highly eroded land, following the flow of the James River through South Dakota from north to south. The Dissected Till Plains, an area of rolling hills and <b>fertile</b> <b>soil</b> that covers much of Iowa and Nebraska, also extends into the southeastern corner of South Dakota.|$|E
5|$|Eastern South Dakota {{is home to}} most of the state's population, and the area's <b>fertile</b> <b>soil</b> is used to grow {{a variety}} of crops. West of the Missouri, {{ranching}} is the predominant agricultural activity, and the economy is more dependent on tourism and defense spending. Most of the Native American reservations are in West River. The Black Hills, a group of low pine-covered mountains sacred to the Sioux, are in the southwest part of the state. Mount Rushmore, a major tourist destination, is there. South Dakota has a temperate continental climate, with four distinct seasons and precipitation ranging from moderate in the east to semi-arid in the west. The state's ecology features species typical of a North American grassland biome.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 19thcentury, the European American {{newcomers}} had begun to remove vegetation, build sawmills, fell trees, fill wetlands, and farm in the <b>fertile</b> <b>soil</b> along Johnson Creek. The creek is named for one of these newcomers, William Johnson, who in 1846 settled in what later became the Lents neighborhood of Portland and operated a water-powered sawmill. In early 1848 Lot Whitcomb, who would later found Milwaukie, filed a donation land claim and built a sawmill near the confluence of Johnson Creek and the Willamette River. In 1886, plans were made for train tracks along the creek. In 1903, the Springwater Division Line, also known as the Portland Traction Company Line, the Cazadero Line, and the Bellrose Line, was built along Johnson Creek to provide rail transport for passengers and freight. Sellwood, Eastmoreland, Lents, and Pleasant Valley were among the new communities that grew up along the line. By the 1920s, housing began to replace creekside farms.|$|E

5|$|Cordyline australis {{is one of}} the few New Zealand {{forest trees}} that can recover from fire. It can renew its trunk from buds on the {{protected}} rhizomes under the ground. This gives the tree an advantage because it can regenerate itself quickly and the fire has eliminated competing plants. Cabbage tree leaves contain oils which make them burn readily. The same oils may also slow down the decay of fallen leaves, so that they build up a dense mat that prevents the seeds of other plants from germinating. When the leaves do break down, they form a <b>fertile</b> <b>soil</b> around the tree. Cabbage tree seed also has a store of oil, which means it remains viable for several years. When a bushfire has cleared the land of vegetation, cabbage tree seeds germinate in great numbers to make the most of the light and space opened up by the flames.|$|E
5|$|Eastern South Dakota {{generally}} features higher precipitation {{and lower}} topography than {{the western part}} of the state. Smaller geographic regions of this area include the Coteau des Prairies, the Dissected Till Plains, and the James River Valley. The Coteau des Prairies is a plateau bordered on the east by the Minnesota River Valley and on the west by the James River Basin. Further west, the James River Basin is mostly low, flat, highly eroded land, following the flow of the James River through South Dakota from north to south. The Dissected Till Plains, an area of rolling hills and <b>fertile</b> <b>soil</b> that covers much of Iowa and Nebraska, extends into the southeastern corner of South Dakota. Layers deposited during the Pleistocene epoch, starting around two million years ago, cover most of eastern South Dakota. These are the youngest rock and sediment layers in the state, the product of several successive periods of glaciation which deposited a large amount of rocks and soil, known as till, over the area.|$|E

50|$|The town of Maaseik {{is located}} on the left bank of the river Meuse (Dutch: Maas), {{bordering}} the Netherlands. For this reason the river is called Grensmaas ('border Meuse') here. Two smaller rivers, the Bosbeek (or Oeterbeek) and the Zanderbeek (or Diepbeek), flow into the Meuse near Maaseik. Because of its location in the Meuse valley, Maaseik has mostly <b>fertile</b> <b>soils.</b> The northwestern part of the municipality is situated on the plain of Bocholt and has less <b>fertile</b> <b>soils.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{area has}} varied rocks (clay, gravel, sands), which {{are covered by}} Quaternary sediments (loess) and very <b>fertile</b> <b>soils</b> (black and brown earths).|$|R
