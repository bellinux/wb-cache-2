5|$|While {{the console}} {{versions}} of the game are fully three-dimensional, the Game Boy Advance version <b>is</b> <b>rendered</b> in an isometric style that incorporates both 2D sprites and 3D models. This version is a more traditional Tony Hawk's game, with little attention given to story or customization. The mobile phone version is similarly restricted.|$|E
5|$|Academic {{criticism}} of Inseminoid has {{concentrated on the}} film's treatment of the female sex and female sexualities {{in the context of}} corruption by an alien source. In addition to its depiction of the abject Sandy, who <b>is</b> <b>rendered</b> a distorted Other in the aftermath of her unnatural impregnation, the film has been seen to incorporate a clash between the patriarchal and the maternal towards its climax, as the new mother kills her former friends one by one. Complementing the film's successful VHS run, a novelisation of Inseminoid was written by Larry Miller.|$|E
5|$|All {{images from}} Hubble are {{monochromatic}} grayscale, in which its cameras incorporate {{a variety of}} filters each passing specific wavelengths of light. Color images are created by combining separate monochrome images taken through different filters. This process can also create false-color versions of images including infrared and ultraviolet channels, where infrared is typically rendered as a deep red and ultraviolet <b>is</b> <b>rendered</b> as a deep blue.|$|E

5|$|Freeze tells Batman that he {{has created}} a cure, but it <b>is</b> <b>rendered</b> useless via instability. Batman deduces that the {{restorative}} properties of Ra's al Ghul's blood can complete the cure and tracks one of his assassins to his underground lair, leading Batman into a confrontation with Ra's and his daughter Talia, Batman's former lover. With Ra's al Ghul's blood, Freeze {{is able to develop}} an antidote, but it is stolen by Harley Quinn before Batman can use it. When Batman returns to the Joker, he finds his health has been restored.|$|E
5|$|Jason Wilkes (portrayed by Reggie Austin) is a {{scientist}} for Isodyne, {{the only company}} willing to hire him as a black man, who informs Carter of the company's Zero Matter discovery. He <b>is</b> <b>rendered</b> invisible and intangible following exposure to the substance, and under its influence he attempts to take drastic steps to gain power. He expresses remorse for his actions after the Zero Matter is eventually purged from his body and he regains tangibility.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} written by Chris Stamper, and {{graphics}} were designed by Tim Stamper. Alien 8 uses the same image masking technique as Knight Lore, which allows the developers to create composite structures out of stacked images without visual overlay. The technique was copyrighted by Ultimate as the Filmation game engine. As with its spiritual predecessor, the game <b>is</b> <b>rendered</b> isometric projection. The game was critically acclaimed upon release. Reviewers praised the game's graphics and innovation, however minor criticism was directed at its similarities to Knight Lore.|$|E

5|$|Thinking {{that the}} Martians {{assumed that the}} dove {{was a symbol of}} war, President Dale tells Professor Donald Kessler to renegotiate with the Martians, whose {{ambassador}} is invited to address the United States Congress. At this meeting, the Martians massacre most of Congress. Donald begs the Martian Ambassador to stop, but <b>is</b> <b>rendered</b> unconscious and taken aboard their ship, where he is later shown with his body parts dismembered and his disembodied head remaining animated. General Decker tries to convince President Dale to retaliate with nuclear warfare, but the President refuses.|$|E
5|$|As {{indicated}} above, it {{was through}} the writings of Dares the Phrygian that the portrayal of Troilus as an important warrior was transmitted to medieval times. However, some authors {{have argued that the}} tradition of Troilus as a warrior may be older. The passage from the Iliad described above is read by Boitani as implying that Priam put Troilus {{on a par with the}} very best of his warrior sons. The description of him in that passage as hippiocharmên <b>is</b> <b>rendered</b> by some authorities as meaning a warrior charioteer rather than merely someone who delights in horses. The many missing and partial literary sources might include such a hero. Yet only the one ancient vase shows Troilus as a warrior falling in a conventional battle.|$|E
5|$|By Your Side was {{released}} on January12, 1999. The album's cover art is a blue-tinted nighttime photograph of the band, all dressed in white and {{standing in front of}} a lake. The band name <b>is</b> <b>rendered</b> in tiny white lights above their heads, and other small white lights are scattered at their feet. In keeping with the tiny lights theme, the back of the booklet shows a satellite image of the United States at night, in which densely populated areas can be discerned by light pollution, and the booklet contains drawings of constellations. The album's disc artwork is designed after a centaur with a crow's head in place of the man's head.|$|E

5|$|Development of Revelation lasted {{more than}} three years; Ubisoft had as many as eighty {{employees}} working on the game. Musician Peter Gabriel lent his voice and a song to the game's audio; the original score was written by Exiles composer Jack Wall. Overall, reception to the game was positive; reviewers lauded the impressive visuals, sound, and puzzles. Publications such as Computer Gaming World took issue with the control scheme of the game. Revelation is the last game in the Myst series to use both prerendered backgrounds and full-motion video; the final game in the series, , <b>is</b> <b>rendered</b> in real-time throughout.|$|E
5|$|Homer portrays Paul Bunyan, a great {{burden on}} the local townspeople, as he crushes their houses and greedily eats all their food. Eventually, the townspeople drug him and drag him out of their town. Out of loneliness, Bunyan carves a block of stone from the {{mountains}} into a blue ox that he calls Babe, who <b>is</b> <b>rendered</b> alive by an electric shock. In his travels with Babe, Homer creates several landmarks. Bunyan later meets a young woman, (played by Marge) and though she is initially frightened of him, the two fall in love. When a meteor is soon to hit the town, the townspeople call Paul back to help them. Paul obliges and throws the meteor towards Chicago, starting the Great Fire there, but not before it hits him in the backside.|$|E
5|$|Lana {{makes her}} first {{literary}} appearance in Smallville: Strange Visitors, published by Aspect. In Strange Visitors, Lana attempts {{to organize a}} fund raiser for {{the family of a}} school mate, Stewart, who was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Her effort <b>is</b> <b>rendered</b> moot when Lex Luthor and Dr. Donald Jacobi, a con artist that comes to Smallville, pick up Stewart's medical bills after a meteor rock removes all of the malignant cancer cells in his brain. In Smallville: Dragon, Lana visits an antiques dealer, Mrs. Mayfern, looking for a gift for her boyfriend, Whitney. When she leaves she breaks up with Whitney and starts dating Clark. It is eventually discovered that she was hypnotized by Mrs. Mayfern, whose homegrown herbal tea is fertilized by meteor rocks.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{available}} einsteinium toxicity data originate from research on animals. Upon ingestion by rats, only about 0.01% einsteinium ends in the blood stream. From there, about 65% goes to the bones, where it remains for about 50 years, 25% to the lungs (biological half-life about 20 years, although this <b>is</b> <b>rendered</b> irrelevant by the short half-lives of einsteinium isotopes), 0.035% to the testicles or 0.01% to the ovaries – where einsteinium stays indefinitely. About 10% of the ingested amount is excreted. The distribution of einsteinium over the bone surfaces is uniform and {{is similar to that}} of plutonium.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{is divided into}} an upper part depicting the halo phenomenon viewed vertically and a lower part depicting the city as it must have appeared viewed from Södermalm in the late Middle Ages. The medieval urban conglomeration, today {{part of the old}} town Gamla stan, <b>is</b> <b>rendered</b> using a bird's-eye view. The stone and brick buildings are densely packed below the church and castle, which are rendered in a descriptive perspective (i.e., their size relates to their social status, rather than their actual dimensions). Scattered wooden structures appear on the surrounding rural ridges, today part of central Stockholm. Though the phenomenon is said to have occurred in the morning, the city is depicted in the evening with shadows facing east.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'í {{notions of}} {{progressive}} religious revelation result in their accepting {{the validity of}} the well known religions of the world, whose founders and central figures are seen as Manifestations of God. Religious history is interpreted as a series of dispensations, where each manifestation brings a somewhat broader and more advanced revelation that <b>is</b> <b>rendered</b> as a text of scripture and passed on through history with greater or lesser reliability but at least true in substance, suited for the time and place in which it was expressed. Specific religious social teachings (for example, the direction of prayer, or dietary restrictions) may be revoked by a subsequent manifestation so that a more appropriate requirement for the time and place may be established. Conversely, certain general principles (for example, neighbourliness, or charity) are seen to be universal and consistent. In Bahá'í belief, this process of progressive revelation will not end; it is, however, believed to be cyclical. Bahá'ís do not expect a new manifestation of God to appear within 1000 years of Bahá'u'lláh's revelation.|$|E

5|$|During the 2004 {{crossover}} event , Black Mask commandeers Oracle's {{computers and}} satellites and engages {{in a fight}} to the death with Batman. In order to prevent Batman from killing his adversary, Oracle initiates the Clock Tower's self-destruct sequence, provoking Batman to rescue her rather than continue the battle. This results in the destruction of Gordon's home and headquarters in the clock tower. Subsequently, Oracle decides to move on, and leaves Gotham City altogether. She cuts her ties with Batman, and after a temporary world trip with her team, relocates to Metropolis. In the events comprising Gail Simone's Birds of Prey: Between Dark and Dawn (2005), and Birds of Prey: The Battle Within (2005), Oracle is possessed by arch-villain Brainiac, an artificial intelligence entity, in order to become a biological being. Although Oracle overpowers Brainiac and expels him from her body, the advanced virus delivered by him remains despite his absence. The virus steadily causes cybernetic attachments to sprout all over her body. Oracle develops supernatural abilities that allow her to psychically interact with computer information systems. Although she loses these abilities after the virus <b>is</b> <b>rendered</b> dormant following an operation by Doctor Mid-Nite, she discovers she can move her toes. However, this proves to be short-lived; Gordon remains paralyzed.|$|E
5|$|Ella tells Thomas {{about the}} deal with Rumpelstiltskin. Seeking to avoid {{fulfilling}} this deal, Thomas, Charming, Grumpy, and The Blue Fairy (Keegan Connor Tracy) {{come up with a}} plot to capture Rumpelstiltskin by luring him into signing another contract. Hours later, Ella and Rumpelstiltskin meet to sign the deal. Ella lies to him and says she is expecting twins and will give him both of the babies in exchange for improving the crops and wealth of the kingdom. A skeptical Rumpelstiltskin agrees, but as he signs the contract, he <b>is</b> <b>rendered</b> powerless due to a special red quill pen, that was created by The Blue Fairy. He is captured, but Thomas disappears soon after. Ella demands that Rumpelstiltskin tell her what has happened, but he claims not to have done anything. He reminds her that all magic has a price, and that until her debt is paid she will never see Thomas again.|$|E
5|$|Logan Cale (Michael Weatherly), an {{underground}} cyber-journalist with the alias Eyes Only, attempts to recruit {{her to help}} fight corruption in the post-Pulse world. She initially refuses but accepts after Cale <b>is</b> <b>rendered</b> a paraplegic attempting the assignment he was recruiting her for. A romantic interest buds between the two. While assisting Cale, Max also makes {{a living as a}} bicycle messenger at Jam Pony, a courier company, along with her friends Original Cindy (Valarie Rae Miller), Herbal Thought (Alimi Ballard), and Sketchy (Richard Gunn). Other X5s are periodically introduced, most significantly the unit leader Zack (William Gregory Lee). The Manticore hunt for the escaped X5s is led by Colonel Donald Lydecker (John Savage). Near {{the end of the season}} Lydecker is betrayed by his superior, the even more ruthless Elizabeth Renfro (Nana Visitor), and he defects from Manticore. He aids Max and Zack in an assault on Manticore headquarters. Max is badly wounded and captured. Zack, who has also been captured, commits suicide to provide Max with his heart, as she needs an X5 heart transplant to survive.|$|E
