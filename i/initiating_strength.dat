40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines (USBM) has {{developed}} a test procedure to compare the <b>initiating</b> <b>strength</b> of detonators by using adjustable-sensitivity liquid explosives. Various tests of detonator strength are currently used by the industry, {{but many of them}} do not quantify the ability of detonators to initiate detonation reactions in an explosive charge. The USBM used mixtures of nitromethane and ethylene diamine, the sensitivity being 'fine-tuned' by 2 -nitropropane. Military standard J- 2, commercial No. 6, and commercial No. 8 detonators were evaluated using three test configurations: (1) axially immersed in the test explosive, (2) tip just touching surface of the explosive, and (3) immersed transversely in the explosive.

Those parameters should be in refer to respectable standard in the oil and gas industry.

40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} resin matrix composites {{and structural}} adhesives have found increased usage on commercial and military aircraft in recent years. Due {{to the lack}} of service history of these relatively new material systems, their long-term aging performance has not been well established. In this study, single lap shear specimens (SLS) were fabricated by secondary bonding of Scotch-Weld(TradeMark) AF- 555 M between pre-cured adherends comprised of T 800 H/ 3900 - 2 uni-directional laminates. The adherends were co-cured with wet peel-ply for surface preparation. Each bond-line of the SLS specimen was measured to determine thickness and inspected visually using an optical microscope for voids. A three-year environmental aging plan for the SLS specimens at 82 C (180 F) and 85 % relative humidity was <b>initiated.</b> SLS <b>strengths</b> were measured for both controls and aged specimens at room temperature and 82 C. The effect of this exposure on lap shear strength and failure modes to date is reported.

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityPost-earthquake investigations {{have shown that the}} primary cause of collapse in cast-in-place beam-column frames is failure of columns, beam-column joints, or both. As axial failure of one or more member in a frame structure does not necessarily constitute the collapse o f that structure, understanding frame-system behavior and frame member interactions leading to collapse is essential in assessing the seismic collapse vulnerability of this type of structure. This study investigates, both experimentally and analytically, the seismic collapse behavior of non-seismically detailed reinforced concrete frames. To accomplish this task, a 2 D, three-bay, three-floor, third-scale reinforced concrete frame is built and dynamically tested to collapse. The test frame contains non-seismically detailed columns whose proportions and reinforcement details allow them to yield in flexure prior to <b>initiating</b> shear <b>strength</b> degradation and ultimately reaching axial collapse (hereafter referred to as flexure-shear critical columns). Experimental data is provided on the dynamic behavior of flexure-shear critical columns sustaining shear degradation and loss of axial load capacity and on load redistribution in a frame system after shear and axial failure of columns. Analytical modeling of the test frame is undertaken up to collapse. Good agreement between analysis and experiment is achieved up to shear failure in columns. A new zerolength fiber-section implementation of bar-slip rotational effects is introduced. A new shear failure model is introduced that determines column rotations at which shear strength degradation in flexure-shear critical columns is initiated. An analytical model of the test frame is subjected to several near-fault ground motions recorded during the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Variability of ground motions from site to site (so called intra-event variability) and directivity effects are found {{to play an important role}} in analytical prediction of structural collapse. A new ground motion intensity measure that relates well to frame damage is proposed...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of drained constant-p' tests on natural undisturbed specimens of Corinth Marl. The specimens were instrumented with local axial strain gauges and pore pressure probes. The relationship between deviator stress q and overall axial strain is characterised by a flat peak followed by a small reduction in strength. The specimen dilates strongly throughout this phase of the test. A steep drop in strength then occurs, resulting in the formation of a thin slip surface and the cessation of dilation. Careful analysis of the results from the local strain gauges indicates that strain localisation <b>initiates</b> after peak <b>strength</b> but before the commencement of the steep drop in q. Most of the reduction in shear strength takes place for relative displacements of less than 0 - 5 mm, after which stable post-rupture strength is reached. The pore pressure probes show that, during the initial stages of drained shearing, a small reduction in local pore pressure occurs {{in the middle of the}} specimen relative to the ends, which is consistent with dilation. This pore pressure difference reduces rapidly during the formation of the slip surface, reflecting the cessation of dilation of the material on either side of the slip surface...|$|R
40|$|Multiple site damage (MSD) is the {{occurrence}} of many small cracks at multiple locations such as rivet holes. Once the MSD is <b>initiated,</b> the <b>strength</b> of structure may be quickly reduced to an unacceptable level and caused catastrophic failure. ^ This dissertation describes research into the fatigue life of lap joint structure with MSD. The load transfer mechanism in joint structure is studied, including several types of rivets, material properties and structure geometry. The load transfer for each rivet is determined {{as a function of}} crack propagation. Two other mechanisms can affect the load transfer mechanism-interference between the rivet and rivet hole due to riveting process, and clamping pressure between the panels, were also investigated. Since these two mechanisms are complicated to analyze, and rely {{on the quality of the}} manufacture and assembly, the riveting process was well controlled by applying the rivet squeeze force through an MTS machine. ^ Single lap joint specimens, containing fatigue MSD in one row of rivet holes, were cycled to failure under constant amplitude loading. A modified MSD life prediction model is used to estimate fatigue life. Predictions for the growth and coalescence of individual cracks are in accordance with the experimental results. During the fatigue tests, the propagation of some small cracks at low remote stress levels were delayed due to clamping-up stress under the countersink rivet head. Marker band analysis, therefore, is utilized to detect the crack growth information under countersink rivet head and includes the delay effect into the fatigue prediction program. ^ The individual/relative effect of two random variables—the interference fit levels and crack length distribution at rivet holes—on MSD fatigue life is investigated. A thousand Monte Carlo simulations are performed to determine the statistical degradation in residual strength as the Wide Fatigue Damage (WFD) extends by fatigue. The fastener interference, reflected as riveting quality, determines the overall evaluation of fatigue behavior of a lap joint. The influence of both rivet installation (i. e. fastener interference) and initial WFD size on fatigue life and residual strength are presented, and indicate the relative influence of these parameters on structural integrity. ...|$|R
40|$|Current {{methods of}} characterizing non-ideal {{explosives}} require large-scale testing to obtain steady detonation wave propagation for analysis {{due to the}} relatively thick reaction zones. A small scale experiment would be very useful in quickly characterizing many materials. Use of a microwave interferometer applied to small-scale confined transient experiments was implemented yielding time resolved characterization of a failing detonation that is useful to models. The microwave interferometer {{was used to measure}} the position of a failing detonation wave in a confiner that was initiated with a booster charge. Experiments have been performed with ammonium nitrate and multiple fuel compositions (diesel fuel and mineral oil). It was observed that the failure dynamics were influenced by factors such as the chemical composition, confiner thickness, and <b>initiating</b> shock wave <b>strength.</b> Thin wall confiners with 0. 71 mm wall thickness experienced detonation failure and decoupling of the shock wave from the reaction zone. Confiners with a wall thickness of 34. 9 mm showed a decrease in detonation velocity as the detonation front advanced. Varying the shock strength (detonation pressure) showed proportional changes in the initial overdriven detonation velocity through the non-ideal explosives. The distance to complete detonation failure was also shown to be proportional to the initial shock strength. The high temporal resolution of the position of the detonation front produced with the microwave interferometer allows for the transient effects associated with the failure dynamics of the detonation to be combined within a single measurement. This experimental method is shown to be repeatable and can be performed with little required material (about 2 grams). ...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of heat treatment during curing process of ultra high strength concrete (UHSC) was researched. Four different heat treatment temperatures ranging from 50 to 2000 C were studied and {{compared to the}} reference temperature regime (200 C). Two series of heat treatment were applied: (a) at the early age of UHSC (3 days) and (b) after 27 days of standard curing regime in water at 200 C. Concrete compressive strength was tested at the early age (4 days) and {{at the age of}} 28 days. The water absorption and water penetration under pressure were tested for heat treated and untreated UHSC specimens. SEM and XRD investigations of the studied samples were performed. UHSC with the strength of 123 MPa at the age of 28 days was tested at the standard curing conditions. Results indicate that early age curing at elevated temperature increases early compressive strength from 123 to 189 % while at the age of 28 days the compressive strength was only 95 to 117 % from reference and depends on the heat treatment regime. The heat treatment of UHSC at the age of 27 days was beneficial with regard to the strength development. Heat-treated UHSC provided compressive strength gain from 112 to 124 % from reference. The water absorption for all UHSC specimens was from 2. 6 to 3. 2 wt. % and it was not affected by the heat treatment. The calcite was detected with XRD in heat treated UHSC samples which indicates the carbonization of Portlandite. This could explain the strength gain of heat-treated samples and the reason for slow compressive strength increase in the case of early heat treatment application. SEM images reveal dense structure and unreacted silica fume particles. The early heat treatment <b>initiated</b> high early <b>strength</b> but the strength of concrete reduced at the age of 28 days comparing to the early strength; therefore late heat application was beneficial for strength gain of the UHSC...|$|R
40|$|Active {{separation}} control, using periodic excitation, was studied experimentally at high Reynolds numbers. The {{effects of}} compressibility, mild sweep, location o excitation slot and steady momentum transfer on {{the efficacy of}} the method were identified. Tests conducted at chord Reynolds numbers as high as 40 x 10 (exp 6) demonstrated that active control using oscillatory flow excitation can effectively delay flow separation from and reattach separated flow to aerodynamic surfaces at flight conditions. The effective frequencies generate one to four vortices over the controlled region at all times, regardless of the Reynolds number. The vortices are initially amplified by the separated shear-layer, and after <b>initiating</b> reattachment, the <b>strength</b> of the vortices decay as they are convected downstream. Large amplitude, low frequency vortices break down to smaller ones upon introduction at the excitation slot. The effects of steady mass transfer were compared to those of periodic excitation. It was found that steady blowing is significantly inferior to periodic excitation in terms o performance benefits and that the response to steady blowing is abrupt, and therefore undesirable from a control point of view. Steady suction and periodic excitation are comparable in effectiveness and both exhibit a gradual response to changes in the magnitude of the control input. The combination of weak steady suction and periodic excitation is extremely effective while the addition of steady blowing could be detrimental. Compressibility effects are weak as long as separation is not caused by a shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction The undesirable effects of the shock-induced separation could be alleviated by the introduction of periodic excitation upstream of the shock wave, inside the region of supersonic flow. The effects of mild sweep were also studied and periodic excitation was found to be very effective in reattaching three-dimensional separated flow. Scaling laws that correlate 2 D and 3 D controlled flows were tested and verified. Several performance benefits could be gained by applying the method to existing configurations, but it is expected that the full potential of the method can only be realized through the design of new configurations. A comprehensive, fully turbulent, database was generated in order to guide the development, and enable validation, of candidate unsteady CFD design tools...|$|R
40|$|Sri Lanka has a {{basement}} rock formation of metamorphic origin {{that the majority}} is gneissic type, which is intensively used {{in many of the}} civil engineering constructions. In addition, foundations of most of the important civil engineering structures are extended up to or into the fresh gneissic rock strata. Sri Lanka has a tropical climate. Therefore the study on durability of gneissic rocks under tropical conditions would be immensely beneficial to the construction industry of the country. The simulation of exact natural weathering conditions is quite complicated. This study concentrates mainly on how heat stress affects deterioration of index properties of gneissic rocks. When the rock mass gets heated, and cooled rapidly due to sudden rainfall, there is a possibility of propagating micro-fractures in the rock mass which will <b>initiate</b> weakening the <b>strength</b> properties of the rock mass. Most of the bridge abutments and dam constructions are associated with basement rock. In such locations rocks mass is alternately subjected to wetting and drying processes. Therefore the deterioration of rock resulting in its breakup, which is termed as "slaking" is also studied in this research. One hundred and sixty rock samples of gneissic rock of diameter 54 mm (NX size) are tested in this research. Out of these 132 samples are fresh competent rocks and 28 are weathered to different degrees. These samples are selected from biotite gneiss and quartzo-feldspathic gneiss; the major two gneissic rock formations found in Sri Lanka. Fresh gneissic rock samples were subjected to heating and the weakening of their strength properties were studied upon cooling. Naturally weathered gneissic rock samples belonging to different weathering grades were also tested for their index properties. These were compared with the index properties of artificially weathered fresh gneissic rock samples and some correlations are established. The rate of deterioration of index properties of quartzo-feldspathic gneiss is seen to be more than that of biotite gneiss. Therefore more attention should be paid in the designing of foundations of important civil engineering structures in quartzo-feldspathic gneiss as far as the 'durability, is concerned, based on the project location...|$|R
40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					Benzodiazepines {{and related}} drugs affect {{physical}} functioning negatively and increase fall and fracture risk. As impaired muscle strength and balance are {{risk factors for}} falls, we {{examined the effects of}} hypnotic withdrawal on handgrip strength and balance in older adult outpatients during and after long-term use of temazepam, zopiclone and zolpidem (here collectively referred to as &# 8220;benzodiazepines&# 8221;). 				 				 					 						Methods 					Eighty-nine chronic users (59 women, 30 men) of temazepam, zopiclone or zolpidem aged &# 8805; 55 &# 160;years participated in a benzodiazepine withdrawal study. Individual physician-directed withdrawal was performed gradually over a one-month period and participants were followed up to six months. Handgrip strength was assessed using a handheld dynamometer, and balance using the Short Berg&# 8217;s Balance Scale during the period of benzodiazepine use (baseline), and at 1, 2, 3 weeks, and 1, 2 and 6 months after initiating withdrawal. Withdrawal outcome and persistence were determined by plasma benzodiazepine-determinations at baseline and at four weeks (&# 8220;short-term withdrawers&# 8221;, n = 69; &# 8220;short-term non-withdrawers&# 8221;, n = 20), and by interviews at six months (&# 8220;long-term withdrawers&# 8221;, n = 34; &# 8220;long-term non-withdrawers&# 8221;, n = 55). Also most of the non-withdrawers markedly reduced their benzodiazepine use. 				 				 					 						Results 					Within three weeks after <b>initiating</b> withdrawal, handgrip <b>strength</b> improved significantly (P&# 8201;&# 8804;&# 8201; 0. 005) compared to baseline values. Among women, long-term withdrawers improved their handgrip strength both when compared to their baseline values (P = 0. 001) or to non-withdrawers (P = 0. 004). In men, improvement of handgrip strength from baseline was not significantly better in withdrawers than in non-withdrawers. However, men did improve their handgrip strength values compared to baseline (P = 0. 002). Compared to balance test results at baseline, withdrawers improved starting from the first week after withdrawal initiation. There was, however, only a borderline difference (P = 0. 054) in balance improvement between the long-term withdrawers and long-term non-withdrawers. Of note, the non-withdrawers tended to improve their handgrip strength and balance compared to baseline values, in parallel with their reduced benzodiazepine use. 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					Withdrawal from long-term use of benzodiazepines can rapidly improve muscle strength and balance. Our results encourage discontinuing benzodiazepine hypnotics, particularly in older women who are at a high risk of falling and sustaining fractures.
