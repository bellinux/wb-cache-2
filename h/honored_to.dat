5|$|Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE was {{the brainchild}} of Nintendo {{producer}} Kaori Ando, who voiced her wish to make a Fire Emblem crossover to fellow producer Hitoshi Yamagami in 2010. Ando's initial vision was for a collaboration between the Fire Emblem and Pokémon series, but this was rejected as a similar collaboration was being developed in the form of Pokémon Conquest. Ando redrafted her proposal and submitted it a week later as a crossover between Fire Emblem and Shin Megami Tensei. Atlus, the developer of the Shin Megami Tensei series, had previously worked with Nintendo on a game titled Itsumo Purikura ☆ Kuradeko Puremium for the Nintendo DSi and 3DS. When the project was originally pitched to Atlus in 2010, it was assumed that they were not interested after their unenthusiastic response and later said they were too busy to undertake the collaboration. Over a year later, Atlus inquired as to whether the subject was still open for discussion, and it transpired that they had been highly enthusiastic while still being too busy with other projects. Shinjiro Takada, who was also working on , was appointed as producer. While he had viewed Fire Emblem as a rival and quality goal for his own work, he was <b>honored</b> <b>to</b> be given the chance to develop a title related to Fire Emblem. The game's directors were Mitsuru Hirata, who was supporting director on , and Eiji Ishida, who worked on both Strange Journey and Shin Megami Tensei IV. Hirata was originally the project's sole director, but seven months after the game's public announcement, Ishida was brought on to co-direct so the amount of work needed for the title could be managed. According to Ishida, it was the company's first original game for eighth-generation consoles. Full development began in 2013. From conception to release, production on Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE lasted five years.|$|E

25|$|According to John Dominic Crossan, Jesus {{sent his}} disciples out to heal and to {{proclaim}} the Kingdom of God.

This implicit challenge to the social hierarchy was part of Jesus' program of radical egalitarianism. These themes of healing and eating are common in early Christian art.|$|E

25|$|Many of the arrivals {{were noted}} Torah {{scholars}} whose communities felt <b>honored</b> <b>to</b> {{be represented in}} Eretz Yisrael and sent them ma'amodos (stipends) on a regular basis. The kollel network that was established many years prior in Jewish communities around the globe, to financially and charitably take care of one another while under the civic authority and care of the foreign governments {{of the countries in}} which Jews lived, also facilitated the use of halukkah charity and allowed religious Jews to study Torah without having to work for a living. Money for this purpose was raised in Jewish communities around the world for distribution among the various kollelim that were correspondingly established (by country or community of origin) in the Old Yishuv, especially in Jerusalem. From the thirteenth through the turn-of-the 20th century, Jewish communities living in the Old Yishuv dispatched travelling emissaries (shlihim or Meshullahim) to raise money in the diaspora for sustenance. The funds they raised were known as Halukah and were collected around the world by these envoys of the religious community, who subsequently assisted in the transference of Diaspora funds to Eretz Yisrael under the larger umbrella of welfare and financial aid.|$|E
