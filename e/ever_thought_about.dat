The series of ten sculptures, housed in {{wall-mounted}} boxes, each having its own name, explores a different theme or spatial relationship. For example, Office Block symbolises the power structures within companies; Only You {{is based on}} romantic relations; Destroy Them treats subjects like education and childhood influences.|$|E

His mother and sister and brother are all fundamentally decent people but his father is just a cold hearted bastard {{when it comes to}} his distant son. There's a painful part of the scene where his father just unloads on him and tells him every hateful thing he <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> him and Sam can't defend himself. We found that fascinating – Sam has killed a man, he's killed a White Walker, he's emerged as such a great hero, but he still can't stand up to his dad." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{plot and}} nature of the episode bear a {{striking}} resemblance to the film Predator (1987), in which a creature that is able to perfectly camouflage itself, {{almost to the point of}} complete invisibility, stalks several humans in a dense jungle. While camping in the woods overnight, Scully sings [...] "Joy to the World" [...] by Three Dog Night while Mulder rests so that he can know she is awake and on guard. Originally, Scully was supposed to sing [...] "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry", a 1949 country song by Hank Williams. However, series creator Chris Carter requested something more [...] "off the wall". Spotnitz, instead, chose [...] "Joy to the World" [...] and later said, [...] "in retrospect, the song was perfect". When talking, Mulder admits that the only time he has <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> [...] "seriously dying" [...] was at the Ice Capades.|$|E

500|$|As a final {{tribute to}} Pauline and Wendy Richard, the BBC aired a special {{television}} programme, EastEnders Revealed: Goodbye Pauline, which provided an emotional {{look back at}} Pauline's pivotal storylines during her time in Walford. It also reunited Wendy Richard with prior cast-mates Todd Carty and James Alexandrou (Mark and Martin respectively), and featured character commentary and tributes from television critics and EastEnders actors such as Anna Wing and Pam St. Clement (Lou and Pat). During the programme—which aired on New Year's Day, 2007—Wendy Richard reflected upon how [...] "proud" [...] she was of her character, commenting: [...] "Pauline had everything in life thrown at her and I think she coped with it very well. It showed how people deal with their problems... She wasn't always grumpy... she did have lots of laughs, but sadly people don't seem to remember that, which is a shame... they still harp on about her wearing her cardigans and Pauline stopped wearing cardigans three years after EastEnders started. She is a good woman, she's a kind woman, a loving woman and all she <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> was her family. That {{was the most important}} thing in her life." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a European {{interview}} music journalist Chuck Philips {{said that}} what impressed him the most about Shakur {{was that he was}} a poet. Philips said [...] "I like sacred texts, myths, proverbs, and scriptures. [...] When Tupac came along, I thought he was quite the poet [...] It wasn't just how cleverly they rhymed. It wasn't just the rhythm or the cadence. I liked their attitude. It was protest music in a way nobody had <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> before. These artists were brave, wise and smart – wickedly smart. Tupac had so many sides. He was unafraid to write about his vulnerabilities." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following an {{extended}} hiatus, the Yuppie Pricks released their third full-length disc in 2008, Balls, on Chicken Ranch Records, an album where [...] "the irony drips like bacon fat," [...] "to negate everything you <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> punk," [...] and which [...] "recontextualizes classics from punk’s ever-growing classic history (Buzzcocks, Big Boys! etc.) and creates new oil guzzling and FOX news approved republican punk anthems." [...] Once again, the Yuppie Pricks dipped into their decidedly un-punk past to parody the Black Crowes' infamous Amorica album, featuring their own male-enhanced {{take on the}} 70's-era Hustler-inspired cover art, and landing them in the October 2008 issue of Blender Magazine.|$|E

5000|$|Because palytoxin {{is such a}} large molecule, it {{took some}} time before the {{complete}} structure (including stereochemistry) was elucidated. In 1982, this problem was solved almost simultaneously by Moore and Hirata. Palytoxin's structure being established, it was synthesized in eight separate parts and then joined together to form the entire molecule. First, palytoxin carboxylic acid was synthesized in 1989 by the group of Harvard professor Yoshito Kishi, and in 1994 they succeeded in making palytoxin from this carboxylic acid. The accomplishment of this synthesis has been named [...] "the Mount Everest of organic synthesis, the largest single molecule that anyone has <b>ever</b> even <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> making" [...] by Crawford in 1989.|$|R
2500|$|After obtaining his BA, Jackman {{completed}} the one-year course [...] "The Journey" [...] at the Actors' Centre in Sydney. About studying acting full-time, he stated, [...] "It wasn't until I was 22 that I <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> my hobby being something I {{could make a}} living out of. As a boy, I'd always {{had an interest in}} theatre. But the idea at my school was that drama and music were to round out the man. It wasn't what one did for a living. I got over that. I found the courage to stand up and say, 'I want to do it'." [...] After completing [...] "The Journey", he was offered a role on the popular soap opera Neighbours but turned it down to attend the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts of Edith Cowan University in Perth, Western Australia, from which he graduated in 1994.|$|E
2500|$|The {{approval}} {{came after}} nearly two years of lobbying governments in both the United States and Canada. In October 2010, Wallenda was approached by Roger Trevino, the {{executive vice president of}} Niagara Falls Redevelopment, at an amusement trade show. [...] Trevino later recalled: [...] "I went up to Wallenda and said ‘Have you <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> walking across the falls?’ and he said, ‘ever since I was a little kid,’ and then he asked about the steps involved." [...] Wallenda later remarked [...] "I believe people are brought into my life for a reason... I take everyone seriously because you just never know [...] ". [...] Trevino next contacted New York State Senator George Maziarz. [...] After Maziarz met Wallenda, he went to work at drafting a bill granting Wallenda a one-time exemption to the state's anti-stunting laws. [...] Dennis H. Gabryszak co-sponsored the bill, and it passed the State Senate and Assembly nearly unanimously. [...] The bill was signed into law by governor Andrew Cuomo on September 23, 2011.|$|E
2500|$|In The Cry of Tamar: Violence Against Women and the Church's Response, Pamela Cooper-White {{criticizes the}} Bible's {{depiction}} of Tamar for {{its emphasis on}} the male roles in the story and the perceived lack of sympathy given to Tamar. [...] "The narrator of 2 Samuel 13 at times portrays poignantly, eliciting our sympathy for the female victim. But mostly, the narrator (I assume he) steers us {{in the direction of}} primary interest, even sympathy, for the men all around her. Even the poignancy of Tamar's humiliation is drawn out for the primary purpose of justifying Absalom's later murder of Amnon and not for its own sake." [...] She opined that [...] "Sympathy for Tamar is not the narrator's primary interest. The forcefulness of Tamar's impression is drawn out, not to illuminate her pain, but to justify Absalom's anger at Amnon and subsequent murder of him." [...] Cooper-White also states that after the incestuous rape, the narrative continues to focus on Amnon, writing, [...] "The story continues to report the perpetrator's viewpoint, the thoughts and feelings after the incident of violence; the victim's viewpoint is not presented. [...] We are given no indication that he <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> her again—even in terms of fear of punishment or reprisal." ...|$|E
6000|$|To {{tell the}} truth, the aldermen {{had been much}} the same persons for about fifteen or twenty years. Some were in the produce business, others were butchers, two were grocers, {{and all of them}} wore blue {{checkered}} waistcoats and red ties and got up at seven in the morning to attend the vegetable and other markets. Nobody had <b>ever</b> really <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> them--that is to say, nobody on Plutoria Avenue. Sometimes one saw a picture in the paper and wondered for a moment who the person was; but on looking more closely and noticing what was written under it, one said, [...] "Oh, I see, an alderman," [...] and turned to something else.|$|R
2500|$|McAlpine's {{carefree}} attitude sometimes put him {{in conflict}} with his disciplinarian manager. In his autobiography, McLean describes his frustration with McAlpine's unwillingness to undertake specialist goalkeeping training, saying, [...] "Hamish McAlpine was the one player {{who was able to}} destroy single-handedly everything I have <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> or believed <b>about</b> the game of football". The pair's most serious disagreement occurred in 1979, resulting in McAlpine being sent home from a tournament in Japan. McAlpine was suspended by the club and temporarily replaced by former England goalkeeper Peter Bonetti.|$|R
5000|$|I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change is {{presented}} {{in the form of a}} series of vignettes connected by the central theme of love and relationships. The play's tagline is [...] "Everything you have <b>ever</b> secretly <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> dating, romance, marriage, lovers, husbands, wives and in-laws, but were afraid to admit." [...] With few exceptions, the scenes stand independent of the others, but progress in a fashion designed to suggest an overall arc to relationships throughout the course of one's life. A first date, for example, comes before scenes dealing with marriage, and scenes dealing with marriage come before those dealing with child rearing. Despite the large number of characters, the show is typically done with a comparatively small cast: the original Off-Broadway production uses a cast of four.|$|R
2500|$|Shoemaker also {{addressed}} an AA group in Charlotte, North Carolina, June 17, 1962 saying:To {{set the record}} straight, that there has gotten going in AA, a kind of rumor, that I {{had a lot to}} do with the 12 steps. I didn't have anymore to do with those 12 steps other than that book had, those twelve steps, I believe came to Bill by himself, I think he told me they came to him in about 40 minutes and I think its one of the great instances of direct inspiration that I know in human history, inspiration which doesn't only bring material straight down outta heaven, but brings rather I think from God the ability to interpret human experience in such a way that you distill it down into transmissible principles, I compare it to Moses going up on a mountain and bringing down Ten tables of the Law, I don't think that's the first time Moses <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> righteousness, but I'm glad he went up there and got those ten and brought em down and gave em to us. And I'm glad Bill got quiet for those 40 minutes, until he finished off these 12 steps and I believe they have only been changed by about one word. Bill said at the end of this talk [...] "Who invented AA?, It was God almighty that invented AA, but this is the story of how we learned to be Free." [...] And he closed by saying [...] "God grant that AA and the program of recovery, and unity, and service be a story that continues into the future as long as God needs it." [...] Praise be to God for it, and for the life of that fellow and all those who where with him in the beginnings of this incredible movement.|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, Haggard {{released}} [...] "Okie From Muskogee," [...] with lyrics ostensibly {{reflecting the}} singer's {{pride in being}} from Middle America where people are conventionally patriotic, don't smoke marijuana, don't take LSD, don't protest by burning draft cards or otherwise challenge authority. In the ensuing years, Haggard gave varying statements regarding whether he intended the song as a humorous satire or a serious political statement in support of conservative values. In a 2001 interview, Haggard called the song a [...] "documentation of the uneducated that lived in America at the time." [...] However, he made several other statements suggesting that he meant the song seriously. On the Bob Edwards Show, he said, [...] "I wrote it when I recently {{got out of the}} joint. I knew {{what it was like to}} lose my freedom, and I was getting really mad at these protesters. They didn't know anything more about the war in Vietnam than I did. I thought how my dad, who was from Oklahoma, would have felt. I felt I knew how those boys fighting in Vietnam felt." [...] In the country music documentary series Lost Highway, he elaborated: [...] "My dad passed away when I was nine, and I don't know if you've <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> somebody you've lost and you say, 'I wonder what so-and-so would think about this?' I was drivin' on Interstate 40 and I saw a sign that said '19 Miles to Muskogee.' Muskogee was always referred to in my childhood as 'back home.' So I saw that sign and my whole childhood flashed before my eyes and I thought, 'I wonder what dad would think about the youthful uprising that was occurring at the time, the Janis Joplins.... I understood 'em, I got along with it, but what if he was to come alive at this moment? And I thought, what a way to describe the kind of people in America that are still sittin' in the center of the country sayin', 'What is goin' on on these campuses?'" [...] In the American Masters documentary about him, he said, [...] "That's how I got into it with the hippies.... I thought they were unqualified to judge America, and I thought they were lookin' down their noses at something that I cherished very much, and it pissed me off. And I thought, 'You sons of bitches, you've never been restricted away from this great, wonderful country, and yet here you are in the streets bitchin' about things, protesting about a war that they didn't know any more about than I did. They weren't over there fightin' that war any more than I was." ...|$|E

As {{a result of the}} analysis of high school students sample(n= 213) from KRIVET's "A Study on the Korean Vocational Consciousness" data, I found several facts as follows. First, approximately a fourth of high school students experienced part-time employment. Second, senior or male students were more experienced than freshmen and junior or female students were. There was no difference according to family income. Third, more high school students experienced part-time employment, relative to other students, have <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> concretely <b>about</b> their career or job Fourth, occupational value high school students experienced part-time employment was more concrete or socio-economical rather than internally oriented. Finally, part-time employment also influenced high school students' occupational sttitude, opinion, and custom. Student's employment became a reality that Korean education and society faced. More and more students involved in part-time employment in modern society and it is influential to student's career. It is necessary to lead student's employment to be desirable, instead of prohibition...|$|R

From that day I have been able to plough a straight path deeper and deeper into tapestry, through my studies in Scotland and Poland, my 8 years as a studio weaver in England and Australia and since 1987 as an independent tapestry artist. The demanding creative ethos of the tapestry department gave me the confidence, motivation and self-discipline I needed to move out into the world as a professional tapestry weaver and artist. What was most inspiring for me as a young student was that my tutors in the department were all practising, exhibiting artists engaging positively with what was then a cutting edge international Fibre Art movement.|$|R
