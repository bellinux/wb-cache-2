5|$|Mobile {{devices are}} also useful for {{providing}} location information; either from <b>inbuilt</b> gps/location tracking or via cell site logs, which track the devices within their range. Such information {{was used to}} track down the kidnappers of Thomas Onofri in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Mobile device {{forensics}} is a sub-branch {{of digital}} forensics relating to recovery of digital evidence or {{data from a}} mobile device. It differs from Computer forensics in that a mobile device will have an <b>inbuilt</b> communication system (e.g. GSM) and, usually, proprietary storage mechanisms. Investigations usually focus on simple data such as call data and communications (SMS/Email) rather than in-depth recovery of deleted data. SMS data from a mobile device investigation helped to exonerate Patrick Lumumba {{in the murder of}} Meredith Kercher.|$|E
5|$|The BT46 was an {{aluminium}} alloy monocoque featuring the trapezoidal cross section common {{to many of}} Gordon Murray’s 1970s designs. It featured <b>inbuilt</b> pneumatic jacks fed from an external supply of compressed air to lift it off the ground for tyre changes during practice. It employed a very early version of the carbon brakes that were in universal use by the mid-1980s—a concept taken from the aircraft industry. The system, which Brabham had been developing since 1976, combined carbon composite brake pads with a steel disc faced with carbon composite 'pucks'.|$|E
5|$|A {{fungus gnat}} from New Zealand, Arachnocampa luminosa, {{lives in the}} predator-free {{environment}} of caves and its larvae emit bluish-green light. They dangle silken threads that glow and attract flying insects, and wind in their fishing-lines when prey becomes entangled. The bioluminescence of the larvae of another fungus gnat from North America which lives on streambanks and under overhangs has a similar function. Orfelia fultoni builds sticky little webs and emits light of a deep blue colour. It has an <b>inbuilt</b> biological clock and, even when kept in total darkness, turns its light on and off in a circadian rhythm.|$|E
5|$|By 1901, the town's {{population}} had reached 5,102, and by 1931 had further doubled to 10,104. The {{early twentieth century}} saw a period of increased urbanization of the area; in the period from the First World War to 1937, 312 council houses were built, and public services, such as electricity supplies and sewerage, were completed. The steep gradient of the Rath was at this time constructed, and in 1939 a Town Hall was opened on Hamilton Terrace, at that time possessing an <b>inbuilt</b> fire station. 1939 also saw the opening of an outdoor swimming pool on the Rath.|$|E
5|$|Rise of Mana was {{intended}} to reach a wide audience, gaining an attention only previously seen by Dawn of Mana in 2006. The concept of the main character switching between angelic and demonic form was suggested by Yagi. The original concept was to keep both characters in separate bodies, with the unoccupied character being controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. The team used the Photon Server middleware to develop the game's multiplayer component. The development team initially thought of creating custom middleware, but the rebuild needed {{would have taken a}} whole year, threatening the project's existence. In search of suitable middleware, the team contacted Fixer, who offered them the use of multiple options including Photon Server. Trying out Photon Server, all the problems faced by the developers were resolved within a two-month period, and the middleware's <b>inbuilt</b> security structure and specification match with the game persuaded the project's engineers to greenlight its use. Rise of Mana was the first Japanese game to use Photon Server. The team needed to create two different specifications for iOS and Android, as Android had higher graphical power. During the early development stage, the team {{thought it would be fun}} to re-create the multiplayer elements in Secret of Mana. The initial idea was to have multiplayer available in standard quests, but this took up too much operational space to be practical, so they reduced this to raid battles. Due to the use of Photon Server, additional player characters could be fully rendered rather than appearing as ghost-like transparent helpers.|$|E

25|$|Malaria struck {{during the}} week of 24 to 30 May and {{although}} a small percentage of men seemed to have an <b>inbuilt</b> resistance, many did not and the field ambulances had their busiest time ever when a very high percentage of troops got malaria; one field ambulance treated about 1,000 patients at this time.|$|E
25|$|Internet {{television}} {{should not}} to be confused with Smart TV, IPTV or with Web TV. Smart television refers to the TV set that has an <b>inbuilt</b> operating system. Internet Protocol television (IPTV) is one of the emerging Internet television technology standards for use by television broadcasters. Web television is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on Internet TV.|$|E

25|$|When a {{full text}} query is {{received}} by the SQL Server query processor, it is {{handed over to the}} FTS query processor in the Search process. The FTS query processor breaks up the query into the constituent words, filters out the noise words, and uses an <b>inbuilt</b> thesaurus to find out the linguistic variants for each word. The words are then queried against the inverted index and a rank of their accurateness is computed. The results are returned to the client via the SQL Server process.|$|E
25|$|The ARW is {{equipped}} with SINCGAR ITT, Harris and Racal communications equipment, which have an <b>inbuilt</b> encryption and frequency-hopping systems. It is also equipped with satellite communications, through the ARW C3 (Command, Control & Communications) function and {{in cooperation with the}} Communications and Information Services Corps (CIS). This means ARW teams can communicate with their GHQ from anywhere in the world. The Army Ranger Wing Intelligence Section has the ability to remotely intercept electronic and telephonic communications, working with the Directorate of Military Intelligence (G2) and Army CIS Corps.|$|E
25|$|The Jama Masjid {{is one of}} {{the finest}} piece of {{architecture}} to be found in Rampur. It resembles the jama masjid in Delhi to some extent and has a beautiful interior. It was built by Nawab Faizullah Khan. It has a unique mughal touch to it. There are several entry-exit gates to the masjid. It has three big domes and four tall minarets with gold pinnacles boasting of a royal touch. It has a main lofty entrance gate that has an <b>inbuilt</b> clock tower occupied by a big clock that was imported from Britain.|$|E
25|$|The Memorandum's {{defenders}} claims go as follows: {{far from}} {{calling for a}} breakup of Yugoslavia on Greater Serbian lines claimed to {{be in favor of}} Yugoslavia. Its support for Yugoslavia was however conditional on fundamental changes to end what the Memorandum argued was the discrimination against Serbia which was <b>inbuilt</b> into the Yugoslav constitution. The chief of these changes was abolition of the autonomy of Kosovo and Vojvodina. According to Norman Cigar, because the changes were unlikely to be accepted passively, the implementation of the Memorandum's program would only be possible by force.|$|E
25|$|In modern times, {{a common}} method for {{producing}} ice cream {{at home is}} to use an ice cream maker, an electrical device that churns the ice cream mixture while cooled inside a household freezer. Some more expensive models have an <b>inbuilt</b> freezing element. A newer method is to add liquid nitrogen to the mixture while stirring it using a spoon or spatula for a few seconds; a similar technique, advocated by Heston Blumenthal as ideal for home cooks, is to add dry ice to the mixture while stirring for a few minutes. Some ice cream recipes call for making a custard, folding in whipped cream, and immediately freezing the mixture. Another method {{is to use a}} pre-frozen solution of salt and water, which gradually melts as the ice cream freezes.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} PSP model (PSP-1000) {{was replaced}} by a slimmer model with design changes (PSP-2000/"Slim & Lite") in 2007. Another remodeling followed in 2008, PSP-3000, which included a new screen and an <b>inbuilt</b> microphone. A complete redesign, PSP Go, came in 2009, followed by a budget model, PSP-E1000, in 2011. The PSP line was succeeded by the PlayStation Vita, released in December 2011 in Japan, and in February 2012 worldwide. The PlayStation Vita features backward compatibility with many PlayStation Portable games digitally released on the PlayStation Network, via PlayStation Store. As of 2017, this is the primary method to purchase PlayStation Portable games digitally because Sony shut down direct access to the PlayStation Store via PSP on March 31, 2016. Shipments of PlayStation Portable hardware ended throughout 2014 worldwide, having sold 80 million units in its 10-year lifetime. Worldwide production of software UMDs ended when the last Japanese factory closed by the end of 2016.|$|E

500|$|Don't Starve is an action-adventure {{game with}} a {{randomly}} generated open world and elements of survival and roguelike gameplay. Combat is handled by [...] pointing and clicking with the mouse, while other activities are controlled by the keyboard, or using the <b>inbuilt</b> gamepad support to play using a controller, giving it a console-like gameplay feel. The goal is to survive as long as possible, with a count {{of the number of}} days the player has survived shown onscreen. The game keeps few records of player progress besides the total number of experience points and the playable characters unlocked. Wilson is the main playable character, but the first character, Willow, can be unlocked with 160 experience points—the player earns 20 each in-game day and receives them after dying—while Woodie, the last, requires the game's limit of 1,600. As is common among roguelikes, death is permanent, barring the use of several rare and difficult to acquire items, like the Meat Effigy, Touch Stone, and Life Giving Amulet.|$|E
500|$|One {{former police}} detective, Frank Chauvin, {{along with a}} Catholic anti-abortion activist, filed suit against the Order of Canada Advisory Council, {{demanding}} that the {{minutes of the meeting}} relating to Morgentaler be made public. The appointment of Morgentaler prompted former Liberal Member of Parliament Clifford Lincoln to write that the workings of the Advisory Council were [...] "mysterious", citing what he theorized to be <b>inbuilt</b> partiality and conflict of interest as reasons why Margaret Somerville, whom Lincoln had twice nominated to the Advisory Council, was turned down for appointment, yet Morgentaler was accepted. Journalist Henry Aubin in the Montreal Gazette opined that the council's rejection of Somerville, her personal opposition to same-sex marriage, and the acceptance of Brent Hawkes, Jane Rule, and Jean Chrétien, all regarded as supporting same-sex unions, as well as the appointment of a controversial figure such as Morgentaler, were all signs that the Advisory Council operated with partisan bias. Aubin also pointed to the presence on the council of members of the Royal Society of Canada, an organization into which Somerville was received.|$|E
500|$|Sandra Lindow {{stated that}} the kemmerhouse was an [...] "effective {{cultural}} {{solution to the problem}} of sexuality", because socially acceptable promiscuous sex (both homo- and hetero-sexual) occurred in the absence of a power differential, thus making it healthy. In addition, Gethenians were shown as having an <b>inbuilt</b> mechanism which forces them to seek consent for any sexual activity. The story further challenges conventional sex mores because the narrator Sov is seduced by her male parent Karrid, so that she may kemmer for the first time as a woman, according to the tradition within their family. However, Karrid does not take advantage of his position, and permits no further sexual activity to take place. Lindow states that this experimentation was possible in a story written in 1995 in a way that it was not when Left Hand was written; [...] "In 1968 and 1969, Le Guin's imagination did not yet include Gethenian homosexuality, gynocentrism, or the multiplicity of connection possible inside a kemmerhouse; however, by 1995 [...] much had changed in the cultural acceptance of sexuality." ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>Inbuilt</b> inefficiencies and wastage in {{distribution}} and storage account for why, {{according to some}} estimates, as much as 40% of food production doesn't reach consumers. Fifty million children in India are malnourished. Food often rots in farms, in transit, or in antiquated state-run warehouses. Cost-conscious organised retail companies will avoid waste and loss, making food available to the weakest and poorest segment of Indian society, while increasing the income of small farmers. Walmart, for example, since its arrival in Indian wholesale retail market, has successfully introduced the [...] "Direct Farm Project" [...] at Haider Nagar near Malerkotla in Punjab, where 110 farmers have been connected with Bharti Walmart for sourcing fresh vegetables directly, thereby reducing waste and bringing fresher produce to Indian consumers.|$|E
2500|$|Ringforts housed {{families}} of {{varying degrees of}} wealth, so {{that some of them}} are more impressive than others. Ringforts do not normally occupy dominant or commanding positions. The only exception to this are the ringforts built in areas of bad drainage where high places are the only suitable spots for habitation. [...] Raftery names three monuments which he finds hard to categorise as being either a ringfort or a hillfort: Cahirciveen; Carraig Aille; and Lough Gur. [...] While the places where they sit are areas of natural defence, they may have been built there for drainage purposes. The buildings themselves are not militaristic or defensive in themselves. They were probably family homesteads. The defining characteristic of hillforts is an <b>inbuilt</b> defensive nature.|$|E
2500|$|An [...] "A600HD" [...] {{model was}} sold with an {{internal}} 2.5" [...] ATA {{hard disk drive}} of either 20 or 40 MB. This model was marketed as a more [...] "scholarly" [...] version of a home computer, previously {{best known for its}} extensive range of games, and retailed at almost double the price of a standard A600. However, this hard disk support introduced some issues with existing Amiga software because the memory used for hard disk control prevented some memory-intensive titles from launching without disabling the hard drive (via the machine's <b>inbuilt</b> boot menu). Later models sold without a hard disk drive in the [...] "Wild, Weird, and Wicked" [...] bundle contained the A600HD label, but with the HD cradle and HD missing.

Typically, some of an HDD's capacity is unavailable to the user because it {{is used by the}} file system and the computer operating system, and possibly <b>inbuilt</b> redundancy for error correction and recovery. Performance is specified by the time required to move the heads to a track or cylinder (average access time) plus the time it takes for the desired sector to move under the head (average latency, which {{is a function of the}} physical rotational speed in revolutions per minute), and finally the speed at which the data is transmitted (data rate).|$|E
2500|$|Each race plays {{different}}ly, {{thanks to}} the different skills and characteristics of the players on offer. For instance, Dwarves, Orcs, Chaos and Undead teams all tend towards a blocking-heavy style of play, grinding down the opposing team as far as possible. Elves, by contrast, tend to have high Agility and plentiful movement, passing and dodging skills, so are more suited to avoiding contact while scoring through running and passing plays. Some teams pose challenges for experienced coaches because of <b>inbuilt</b> imbalances. For instance the Lizardmen team has a mixture of fast-moving Skinks and slow, heavy Sauruses, {{the challenge for the}} player being to make good use of these two complementary player types; the Halfling team is mainly composed of Halflings, who on the face of things are entirely incompetent thanks to being both weak, slow and unskilled, but can nonetheless be played effectively ...|$|E
2500|$|Humanistic {{psychology}} {{was developed}} in the 1950s in reaction to both behaviorism and psychoanalysis, largely due to the person-centered therapy of Carl Rogers (often referred to as Rogerian Therapy) and existential psychology developed by Viktor Frankl and Rollo May. Rogers believed that a client needed only three things from a clinician to experience therapeutic improvement—congruence, unconditional positive regard, and empathetic understanding. By using phenomenology, intersubjectivity and first-person categories, the humanistic approach seeks {{to get a glimpse of}} the whole person and not just the fragmented parts of the personality. This aspect of holism links up with another common aim of humanistic practice in clinical psychology, which is to seek an integration of the whole person, also called self-actualization. From 1980, Hans-Werner Gessmann integrated the ideas of humanistic psychology into group psychotherapy as humanistic psychodrama. [...] According to humanistic thinking, each individual person already has <b>inbuilt</b> potentials and resources that might help them to build a stronger personality and self-concept. The mission of the humanistic psychologist is to help the individual employ these resources via the therapeutic relationship.|$|E
2500|$|... "The real {{difficulty}} of the stunt lay not in the leap itself, since she had practiced this with the train stationary and it clearly presented no difficulties, but in the timing. What such stunts require is an <b>inbuilt</b> awareness {{of the speed of}} the moving object. During the course of a leap where a moving object is concerned, the spatial relationship between take-off point and landing point changes. It is quite possible to imagine a leap from a static take-off point on to the roof of a moving train in which the stuntman aims to land halfway along a carriage roof yet in fact-because of the speed of the train-lands in the gap between two carriages. It seems that in such a leap the safest place to aim at is the gap itself At least in that way one can guarantee to miss it. Helen Gibson had this sensitivity to spatial relationships between objects in motion, but it is certainly not a gift shared by all stuntmen." [...] Arthur Wise from Stunting In the Cinema, 1973.|$|E

[...] Original {{features}} include iron fixtures and stained glass. [...] Portslade Infants School was designed by E.H.L. Barker and opened on 23 July 1903. [...] The building has distinctive polychromatic walls with bands of red, black and blue bricks, and the steep roof continues this pattern by contrasting red tiles against black slates. In contrast, the nearby St Nicolas' Church of England School, designed by the architect of St Bartholomew's Church Edmund Scott in 1867, is a simple Gothic Revival building of flint. [...] Anthony Carneys' design for the new Aldrington Church of England Primary School (1991) consisted of a [...] "cluster of buildings with a Dutch barn feel to the roofline" [...] and a rural ambience, despite the urban location.

2500|$|In the 1980s IBM {{introduced}} a Selectric III {{and several other}} Selectric models, some of them word processors or typesetters instead of typewriters, but by {{then the rest of}} the industry had caught up with the trend, and IBM's new models did not dominate the market the way the first Selectric had. This was to be expected, as by the late 1970s the Selectric typewriter's dominance was under assault from both 35-45 character per second proportional-spacing electronic typewriters with <b>inbuilt</b> memory (e.g. the 800 from Xerox based on Diablo's [...] "daisywheels" [...] and from OEMs of Qume who had a similar printwheel technology) and CRT-based systems from AES, Lexitron, Vydek, Wang and Xerox (see the Word Processor article for further details of these brands).
