40|$|In steel¿concrete {{composite}} beams, {{the longitudinal}} shear force is transferred across the steel flange/concrete slab interface by the mechanical {{action of the}} shear connectors. The ability of the shear connectors to transfer these longitudinal shear forces depends on their strength, and also on {{the resistance of the}} concrete slab against longitudinal cracking induced by the high concentration of shear force. Most of the research in composite construction has concentrated on the more traditional reinforced concrete and metal deck construction, and little information is given on shear capacity of the <b>headed</b> <b>studs</b> in precast hollowcore slabs. In this paper, a standard push test procedure for use with composite beams with precast hollowcore slabs is proposed.

40|$|The current AISC Specification for Structural Steel Buildings (AISC, 2005 a) is {{the lead}} {{specification}} for composite construction in the U. S. However, these provisions do not provide a recommendation for computing the strength of <b>headed</b> steel <b>stud</b> anchors (traditionally used as shear connectors) under tension or combined tension and shear. Headed stud anchors are subjected to these types of forces in composite structures such as infill walls, composite coupling beams, the connection region of composite columns, or composite column bases. While ACI 318 - 08 Appendix D (ACI, 2008) and PCI 6 th Ed.

It would thus be beneficial to have design guidance specifically for the case of <b>headed</b> steel <b>stud</b> anchors subjected to tension or combined tension and shear in composite construction, evaluated {{within the context of}} the AISC Specification.

H 577 P CEE 2017 Zhaoxxxii, 329 pages :color illustrationsHybrid fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) -concrete-steel double-skin tubular members (DSTMs) are a {{new form}} of hybrid members {{developed}} at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU). A hybrid DSTM consists of an outer tube made of FRP and an inner tube made of steel, with the space between them filled with concrete. The existing studies on hybrid DSTMs have been mainly focused on their use as compression members, with only a very limited number of studies on their use as flexural members [i. e., hybrid double-skin tubular beams (DSTBs) ]. The limited existing studies on DSTBs have generally been limited to the testing of small-scale specimens without shear connectors. Against this background, this thesis presents a systematical study, both experimentally and theoretically, aimed at the development of an in-depth understanding of the structural behaviour of large-scale DSTBs with <b>headed</b> <b>stud</b> shear connectors. The research project mainly consisted of two parts: the first part was on the behaviour and modelling of <b>headed</b> <b>stud</b> shear connectors in hybrid DSTBs and the second part was on the behaviour and modelling of large-scale hybrid DSTBs with <b>headed</b> <b>stud</b> shear connectors. In the first part, the behaviour of <b>headed</b> <b>stud</b> shear connectors was investigated experimentally using a modified push-out test set-up. A three-dimensional (3 D) finite element (FE) approach using ABAQUS was developed to predict the behaviour of <b>headed</b> <b>stud</b> shear connectors. The main advantage of the proposed FE approach over existing approaches lies in the use of a reliable constitutive model for confined concrete under a general state of multiaxial stresses. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed FE approach were demonstrated by comparing its predictions with the test results. A parametric study was then carried out using the verified FE approach to clarify the effects of various parameters on the behaviour of <b>headed</b> <b>stud</b> shear connectors. Based on the parametric study, new equations for the load-slip behaviour of <b>headed</b> <b>stud</b> shear connectors were proposed. In the second part, four large-scale hybrid DSTBs with <b>headed</b> <b>stud</b> shear connectors under three-point/four-point bending were first tested. Four different cross-sectional configurations, including a DSTB/FRP-reinforced deck unit, were included in the tests. A 3 D FE approach with ABAQUS/Explicit was then proposed for the modelling of hybrid DSTBs, in which the relative slips between the concrete and the steel tube were duly considered. The bond mechanisms in hybrid DSTBs were investigated using the FE approach to clarify the effects of key parameters. The FE approach was shown to be able to accurately predict both the global load-deflection response and the local relative slips between steel and concrete in hybrid DSTBs. In addition, a force-based fibre-section beam/column element model, which is capable of accounting for the relative slips between the concrete and the steel tube, was developed to model hybrid DSTBs. The accuracy of the beam/column element model was demonstrated to be comparable to that of the 3 D FE approach but the former is much more computationally efficient than the latter.

40|$|This thesis {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} an experimental investigation of the behaviour of <b>headed</b> <b>stud</b> connectors in push-out specimens with <b>headed</b> <b>studs</b> embedded in solid slabs and in slabs with wide ribbed metal deck oriented parallel to the beam. The experimental investigation involved the testing of 104 push-out specimens and was conducted in three phases. The first phase involved a study of the effects of transverse stud spacing on the shear strength of <b>headed</b> <b>studs</b> in push-out specimens with solid slabs and those with wide ribbed metal decks. The objectives of the second phase were to conduct a parametric study of the behaviour of <b>headed</b> <b>studs</b> in push-out specimens with solid slabs and to propose new equations for predicting the ultimate stud capacity for this case. A similar study involving specimens with wide ribbed metal decks formed the third phase. For specimens with 150 mm solid slabs, there is an increase in the shear capacity of <b>headed</b> <b>studs</b> when the transverse stud spacing is increased from 3 times the stud diameter to 4 times the stud diameter (d) beyond which the strength-transverse stud spacing curve forms a plateau. The percentage increase in stud shear capacity is higher when failure is concrete related than when shank shear of studs is the mode of failure. For specimens featuring 150 mm slabs with wide ribbed metal decks, the shear capacity of <b>headed</b> <b>studs</b> attains a maximum value when the transverse spacing is 3 d and decreases when the transverse spacing is increased to 4 d beyond which the strength-transverse stud spacing curve forms a plateau. For specimens with solid slabs, there is an increase in the stud shear capacity with the increase in longitudinal stud spacing, up to a transition point, beyond which the strength-longitudinal stud spacing curve forms a plateau. This transition point occurs at a longitudinal stud spacing of approximately 5 d when the concrete compressive strength is approximately 25 MPa and at 4. 5 d when the compressive strength of concrete is over approximately 30 MPa. In general, the failure modes of specimens with closely spaced studs was concrete related. When the stud spacing was increased, the failure mode changed to shank shear of studs. The effect of concrete compressive strength on the shear capacity of studs was found to vary approximately in proportion to the square root of the increase in the compressive strength of concrete. The effect of transverse reinforcement is more pronounced for specimens with concrete related failure than those with shank shear failure of studs. A new equation proposed by the author for predicting the shear capacity of <b>headed</b> <b>studs</b> in solid slabs provides much better correlation to test results than those obtained using CSA and Eurocode 4 provisions. Unlike these code provisions, the proposed equation takes into account the effects of longitudinal and transverse stud spacing, and transverse reinforcement. For the specimens with wide ribbed metal deck, the relationship between longitudinal stud spacing and stud capacity was nonlinear and the strength-longitudinal stud spacing curve did not attain a plateau within the range of longitudinal stud spacings considered. Within the range of the flute widths considered, the deck geometry {{does not appear to have}} any significant influence on the stud capacity for specimens with 150 mm slabs as well as for those with 103 mm slabs. The most common failure mode for the specimens with wide ribbed metal decks was concrete shear plane failure.

40|$|NoIn {{composite}} steel beams with precast {{hollow core}} slabs, {{the amount of}} transverse reinforcement can {{have a significant effect}} on the shear and slip capacity of the mechanical shear connectors. The issue of connector ductility becomes especially important when partial shear connection is adopted, as premature failure of the shear connectors would lead to sudden failure of the composite beam. This chapter presents its findings on the effect of transverse reinforcement on connector ductility and proposes design equations.

The greatest steps {{in the development of}} this type of construction were made when the <b>headed</b> <b>stud</b> shear connector was introduced, the slim floors were launched and the high-strength materials were utilized. The coaction of high-strength steel and high-strength concrete in composite girders with solid slabs for building construction and the impact on the bearing- and the deformation-behaviour are researched in this thesis based on tests and numerical calculations. In addition to that the design of a new single push-out test allowed the systematic investigation of the behaviour of one single stud shear connector under pure shear loading.

First for the 948 cc Herald, and again for the 1147 cc Herald 1200, the cylinders were re-aligned to give better clearance for the <b>head</b> <b>studs</b> and allow the bore to be enlarged. The engine was further developed and bored from 69.3 mm in the 1147 cc version to 73.7 mm giving 1296 cc for the Herald 13/60, the stroke was also increased from 76 mm to 86.5 mm providing 1493 cc for the Spitfire 1500.|$|R
5000|$|Originally, the Akapana {{was thought}} to have been {{developed}} from a modified hill. Twenty-first century studies have shown that it is an entirely manmade earthen mound, faced with a mixture of large and small stone blocks. The dirt comprising Akapana appears to have been excavated from the [...] "moat" [...] that surrounds the site. The largest stone block within the Akapana, made of andesite, is estimated to weigh 65.70 metric tons.

40|$|AbstractIn general, {{there are}} limited {{experimental}} {{reports on the}} shear resistances of typical interfacial shear connections of <b>headed</b> shear <b>studs</b> and solid concrete slabs with local aggregates in Hong Kong. Moreover, while it is commonly reckoned {{that the presence of}} any tensile force in the <b>headed</b> shear <b>stud</b> will reduce its shear resistance significantly, there are few test data in the literature on combined shear and tensile resistances of <b>headed</b> shear <b>studs</b> in solid concrete slabs. Hence, in order to provide technical guidance and design data on the structural behaviour of the interfacial shear connections for construction in Hong Kong, a total of twelve push-out tests were carried out to obtain the shear resistances of the shear studs in i) standard push-out tests where the shear studs are under direct shear force, and ii) modified push-out tests where the shear studs are under combined shear and tension. It {{should be noted that the}} standard test arrangement recommended by Eurocode 4 is adopted, and <b>headed</b> shear <b>studs</b> with a diameter of 19 mm and solid slabs with Grade 30 concrete are used. Details of the tests as well as the test results are presented in the paper. Moreover, the load-slippage curves of the test specimens are analyzed rationally to provide two standardized load-slippage curves to describe the structural behaviour of the connections during the entire loading ranges...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the tensile {{behaviour}} of a {{new type}} of blind bolt, the anchored blind bolt, has been studied. This type of bolt consists of a conventional blind bolt with a <b>headed</b> <b>stud</b> extension that anchors it into the infill concrete. It has been developed for use in moment-resisting connections between I-beams and concrete-filled hollow section columns. The behaviour of these connections is highly dependent on the tensile behaviour of the anchored blind bolts. Hence, the fundamental mechanics of this behaviour has been studied here, both experimentally and in simulations using FE models. The complex interactions between the <b>headed</b> <b>stud</b> anchorage, the concrete infill, and the steel tube have been examined in detail. The experimental and numerical findings were used to understand the influence of important parameters in the tensile behaviour of the anchored blind bolts. It was found that the location of the bolt with respect to the side walls of the tube had a substantial influence on the behaviour of the anchored blind bolts. All the bolts located close to the side walls of the square hollow sections reached the ultimate tensile capacity of the equivalent structural bolts. This was due {{to the development of a}} concrete strut which transferred the load to the corner of the steel section. The bolt diameter also had a significant influence on the stiffness and strength of the anchored blind bolts...|$|R
