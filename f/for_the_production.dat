The acronym DIS comes from Dalnij Istrebitel Soprovozhdenya or long-range escort fighter. Similarly, the MiG-9 designation was intended <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> version of the MiG-3 with the ASh-82 radial engine. This name was reused shortly afterwards for the first Mikoyan-Gurevich jet fighter.|$|E

In this work we study <b>the</b> pair <b>productions</b> of <b>the</b> charged or neutral PGBs at the LHC and ILC. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>productions</b> at <b>the</b> LHC we consider the processes proceeding through gluon-gluon fusion and quark-antiquark annihilation, while <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>productions</b> at <b>the</b> ILC we consider both the electron-positron collision and the photon-photon collision.

Therefore, in future experiments these productions may be detectable and allow for probing TC 2 model.
