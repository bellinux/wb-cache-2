50|$|The Agora World Wide Web email browser {{was based}} on the Line <b>Mode</b> <b>Browser.</b> The Line <b>Mode</b> <b>Browser</b> was very popular in the {{beginning}} of the web, since it was the only web browser available for all operating systems. Statistics from January 1994 show that Mosaic had quickly changed the web browser landscape and only 2% of all World Wide Web users browsed by Line <b>Mode</b> <b>Browser.</b> The new niche of text-only web browser was filled by Lynx, which made the Line <b>Mode</b> <b>Browser</b> largely irrelevant as a browser. One reason was that Lynx is much more flexible than the Line <b>Mode</b> <b>Browser.</b> It then became a test application for the libwww.|$|R

25|$|Word 2011, {{released}} in October 2010, replaced the Elements Gallery {{in favor of}} a Ribbon user interface that is much more similar to Office for Windows, and includes a <b>full-screen</b> <b>mode</b> that allows users to focus on reading and writing documents, and support for Office Web Apps.|$|R
50|$|Two {{variations}} on Norton AntiVirus 2009 are also marketed by Symantec. The Gaming edition provides finer control over when Norton downloads updates and allows {{components of the}} suite to be disabled either manually or automatically when the computer enters <b>full-screen</b> <b>mode.</b> The Classic edition cannot find or remove adware and spyware.|$|R

5000|$|As of 2009, {{site-specific}} browsers {{have not}} been developed for mobile browsers. Instead, the closest to such a sort of SSB that has been allowed is through Safari's iOS-specific feature of <b>full-screen</b> <b>mode</b> for specially-designed webpages which have been previously bookmarked on the iPhone OS Home screen as a [...] "Web Clip".|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to the standard view with all controls, and features, there is a multi-window view allowing each element (navigator, playlist, context information) to be shown in a separate window which can be located and arranged individually. A <b>full-screen</b> <b>mode</b> is available and the player could also {{be sent to the}} notification area. aTunes colors can be changed by switching themes.|$|R

50|$|In recent years, Mac {{applications}} {{have started}} to utilize HUDs as displays for buttons and controls, such as in QuickTime, which shows the user a transparent, rounded, and rectangular control bar that floats within {{the bottom of a}} video but does not touch the very bottom of the application window; this is usually the main means of control of the video playback when in <b>full-screen</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|R
50|$|Notes: When emulating an Apple IIe, only a <b>full-screen</b> <b>mode</b> is {{available}} and all native Macintosh functions are suspended while running. A graphical control panel {{is available}} for configuring the virtual Apple II slots and peripherals; however, the Macintosh (as well as Apple IIe emulation) still remains suspended during this activity. Macintosh functions and control resume only once emulation is completely shut down and exited.|$|R
50|$|The Line <b>Mode</b> <b>browser</b> {{got a new}} {{function}} {{to interact with the}} libwww library as a sample and test application.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{introduction}} of Apple's X11.app, XDarwin was the only X11 server available for OS X. According to the XonX project, X11.app itself contains code from XDarwin. Programs such as OpenOffice.org use XDarwin {{to run in the}} X11 windowing environment, either in a rootless or <b>full-screen</b> <b>mode.</b> A version of the program was created for Mac OS X Panther or higher that runs in the native Aqua interface.|$|R
50|$|Since its start, Microsoft Windows {{includes}} a console to display DOS software. Later versions added the Win32 console {{as a native}} interface for command-line interface and TUI programs. The console usually opens in window mode, {{but it can be}} switched to full true text mode screen and vice versa by pressing the Alt and Enter keys together. <b>Full-screen</b> <b>mode</b> is not available in Windows Vista and later, but may be used with some workarounds.|$|R
5000|$|Charles Ardai of Computer Gaming World {{noted that}} the PC port of the game had {{performance}} and graphics issues when played in <b>full-screen</b> <b>mode.</b> Best performance was achieved when the screen was set to a postcard-sized frame. He found the action to be basic, {{although there is a}} variety of animation. He added that it is [...] "suffused with all the monster movie fun that was conspicuously lacking in the recent Godzilla film".|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the expected functions of an operating system, DPPX included several functions which allowed for remote administration, such as Distributed Host Command Facility (DHCF), which allowed a Host Command Facility (HCF) user on a mainframe to log on in either <b>full-screen</b> <b>mode</b> or line mode to execute commands as though logged on locally, and Distributed Systems Network (or Node) Executive (DSNX), which allowed a Distributed Systems Executive (DSX) (later NetView/DM) job to manage files.|$|R
5000|$|Flash Player 9 (initially called 8.5): Added ActionScript 3.0 {{with the}} advent of a new virtual machine, called ActionScript Virtual Machine 2 (AVM2), which coexists with the {{previous}} AVM1 needed to support legacy content. Performance increases were a major objective for this release of the player including a new JIT compiler. Support for binary sockets, E4X XML parsing, <b>full-screen</b> <b>mode</b> and Regular Expressions were added. This is the first release of the player to be titled Adobe Flash Player.|$|R
25|$|The laptop {{uses the}} Sugar {{graphical}} user interface, written in Python, {{on top of}} the X Window System and the Matchbox window manager. This interface is not based on the typical desktop metaphor but presents an iconic view of programs and documents and a map-like view of nearby connected users. The current active program is displayed in <b>full-screen</b> <b>mode.</b> Much of the core Sugar interface uses icons, bypassing localization issues. Sugar is also defined as having no folders present in the UI.|$|R
25|$|It is {{available}} {{free of charge}} for both macOS and Windows operating systems. There are some other free player applications that rely on the QuickTime framework, providing features not available in the basic QuickTime Player. For example, iTunes can export audio in WAV, AIFF, MP3, AAC, and Apple Lossless. In addition, macOS has a simple AppleScript {{that can be used}} to play a movie in <b>full-screen</b> <b>mode,</b> but since version 7.2 full-screen viewing is now supported in the non-Pro version.|$|R

50|$|In 1991 {{after the}} release of WorldWideWeb, Nicola Pellow {{developed}} the first cross-platform web <b>browser,</b> Line <b>Mode</b> <b>Browser,</b> which is credited for making the internet accessible to consumers for the first time.|$|R
5000|$|The {{simplicity}} of the Line <b>Mode</b> <b>Browser</b> had several limitations.The Line <b>Mode</b> <b>Browser</b> was designed to work on any operating system using what were called [...] "dumb" [...] terminals. The user interface had to {{be as simple as}} possible. The user began with a command-line interface specifying a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). The requested web page was then printed line by line on the screen, like a teleprinter. Websites were displayed using the first versions of HTML. Formatting was achieved with capitalization, indentation, and new lines. Header elements were capitalized, centered and separated from the normal text by empty lines.|$|R
50|$|Instant WebKiosk, is a live {{operating}} system for PCs and Macs designed for web kiosks. The browser (defaults to Google Chromium) {{is locked in}} <b>full-screen</b> <b>mode.</b> Users may change settings but after a reset (typically at end of session) the {{operating system}} defaults to the originally defined values. The operating system is designed to boot from USB flash devices, but may optionally be installed to a hard drive. Network access is via wired or wireless networks. All system configuration is done via a web interface.|$|R
50|$|Image editing {{includes}} crop, resize, and rotate. Images can {{be adjusted}} by modifying their brightness, contrast, tint, and gamma level manually or automatically, and by converting them between file formats. Many of these changes {{can be applied to}} multiple images in one operation using batch processing. Resize can be applied towards the display of animated GIF images to make them larger in either windowed or <b>full-screen</b> <b>modes.</b> Lossless functions can be applied to JPG images in order to optimize the files without change to the displayed image.|$|R
50|$|The Agora server {{is based}} on the Line <b>Mode</b> <b>Browser</b> and on the libwww and thus it {{supported}} different kinds of internet protocols besides the classical http and gopher browsing, namely NNTP, Archie, Finger, WAIS.|$|R
2500|$|As {{features}} {{are added to}} Tux Paint, configuration options have been added that allow parents and teachers to disable features and alter the behavior to better suit their children's or students' needs, or to better integrate the software in their home or school computing environment. Typical options, such as enabling or disabling sound effects and <b>full-screen</b> <b>mode</b> are available. [...] There are also options that help make Tux Paint suitable for younger or disabled children, such as displaying text using only uppercase letters or ignoring the distinction between buttons on the mouse.|$|R
50|$|The Daedalus Encounter was {{developed}} by Mechadeus and published by Virgin Interactive. The live-action segments were filmed on location on Cinerent Stage A in San Francisco. The game was released for MS-DOS and 3DO. In the MS-DOS version, the video is in a window inside of an organic interface, but the player can hit the spacebar to play the video in <b>full-screen</b> <b>mode.</b> In the 3DO version, the video is full-screen. The game was {{also part of the}} multimedia package that was included with the Macintosh Performa at the time.|$|R
50|$|The Linux kernel {{supports}} virtual consoles, typically accessed {{through a}} Ctrl-Alt-F key combination. Up to 64 consoles may be accessed (12 via function keys), each displaying in <b>full-screen</b> text <b>mode.</b>|$|R
