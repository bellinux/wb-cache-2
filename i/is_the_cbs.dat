2500|$|On October 19, 1953, {{near the}} end of his morning radio show— {{deliberately}} waiting until after the television portion had ended— after lavishing praise on LaRosa in introducing the singer's performance of [...] "Manhattan," [...] Godfrey thanked him and then announced that this was LaRosa's [...] "swan song" [...] with the show, adding, [...] "He goes now, out on his own— as his own star— soon to be seen on his own programs, and I know you'll wish him godspeed as much as I do". Godfrey then signed off for the day saying, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>CBS</b> Radio Network". LaRosa, who had to be told what the phrase [...] "swan song" [...] meant, was dumbfounded, since he had not been informed beforehand of his departure and contract renegotiations had yet to happen. In perhaps a further illumination of the ego that Godfrey had formerly kept hidden, radio historian Gerald Nachman, in Raised on Radio, claims that what really miffed Godfrey about his now-former protege was that LaRosa's fan mail had come to outnumber Godfrey's. It is likely that a combination of these factors led to Godfrey's decision to discharge LaRosa. It is not likely Godfrey expected the public outcry that ensued, a result of the incident running directly counter to Godfrey's avuncular image.|$|E

We critically discuss possible reasons for this significant difference in relation to the characteristics of the imaging technique arguing that, at least in the considered case of low electron scattering materials as polymer systems, ADF-STEM tomography provides good contrast between the components and volume data sets most suitable for further reliable quantification of nanofiller concentrations and filler distributions in polymer nanocomposite systems...|$|R
