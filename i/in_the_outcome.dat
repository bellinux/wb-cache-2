Spinal cord injury, facial trauma, traumatic aortic rupture, injuries to the abdomen, lung, and head are present in 40–100%. The most common accompanying injury is esophageal perforation or rupture (known as Boerhaave syndrome), which occurs in as many as 43% of the penetrating injuries to the neck that cause tracheal injury.|$|E
5|$|Riegels did play, and {{he turned}} in a stellar second half performance, {{including}} blocking a Tech punt.

Georgia Tech's safety score after the wrong way run made the difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of the game, which increased the significance of Roy's mistake. In spite of the loss, the example of how the distraught Riegels was persuaded to pick himself up, return to the field and play so hard during the second half is sometimes used by motivational speakers to illustrate overcoming setbacks.|$|E

5|$|The hearing {{began on}} 21 January 1997, under the {{supervision}} of a three-judge panel led by Mikaela Warsito. After both sides were unable to come to an amicable settlement, a several-month-long trial began, in which Udin's family, Bernas reporters, and the police testified. On 7 April 1997, Wuryanto was convicted of destroying evidence for taking the blood, which Marisyem's lawyers speculated was used to frame Sumaji. Only {{a small percentage of the}} damages were awarded, after the court ruled that testimony from Udin's family– whom they saw as having a conflict of interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of the case– was ineligible.|$|E

5|$|Within {{the context}} of the battle itself, the failure of the Red Army to {{properly}} regroup during the prelude to the battle and the ability of the Germans to effectively collect intelligence on Soviet movements played an important role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome.</b> Poor Soviet performance in the north and equally poor intelligence-gathering at the hands of Stavka and front headquarters, also eventually spelled doom for the offensive. Nonetheless, despite this poor performance, it underscored a dedicated evolution of operations and tactics within the Red Army which borrowed and refined the pre-war theory, Soviet deep battle.|$|E

In addition, there might exist gender differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> of moving, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family context. Therefore, both genders are investigated. The consequences of migration are examined both in terms of income and employment. A very large data set is utilised, and many-sided estimation techniques are used. ...|$|R

5|$|In {{response}} to Godas' emissaries, Justinian detailed Cyril, {{one of the}} officers of the foederati, with 400 men, to accompany the invasion fleet and then sail on to Sardinia. Gelimer reacted to Godas' rebellion by sending the bulk of his fleet, 120 of his best vessels, and 5,000 men under his own brother Tzazon, to suppress it. The Vandal king's decision played a crucial role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of the war, for it removed from the scene the Vandal navy, the main obstacle to a Roman landing in Africa, as well as a large part of his army. Gelimer also chose to ignore the revolt in Tripolitania for the moment, as it was both a lesser threat and more remote, while his lack of manpower constrained him to await Tzazon's return from Sardinia before undertaking further campaigns. At the same time, both rulers tried to win over allies: Gelimer contacted the Visigoth king Theudis (r. 531–548) and proposed an alliance, while Justinian secured the benevolent neutrality and support of the Ostrogothic Kingdom of Italy, which had strained relations with the Vandals over the ill treatment of the Ostrogoth princess Amalafrida, the wife of Thrasamund. The Ostrogoth court readily agreed to allow the Roman invasion fleet to use the harbour of Syracuse in Sicily and establish a market for the provisioning of the Roman troops there.|$|E
5|$|The {{increasingly}} unpopular war in Korea dragged on, and the Truman {{administration was}} beset {{with a series}} of corruption scandals. He eventually decided not to run for re-election. Adlai Stevenson, the Democratic candidate in the 1952 presidential election, attempted to distance himself from the President as much as possible. The election was won by the Republican candidate, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose administration ramped up the pressure on the Chinese in Korea with conventional bombing and renewed threats of using nuclear weapons. Coupled with a more favorable international political climate {{in the wake of the}} death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, this led the Chinese and North Koreans to agree to terms. The belief that the threat of nuclear weapons played an important part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> would lead to their threatened use against China on a number of occasions during the 1950s.|$|E
