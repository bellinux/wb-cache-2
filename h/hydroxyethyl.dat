5|$|As {{with other}} sports, some {{competitors}} in cross-country skiing {{have chosen to}} enhance their performance through doping. Anti-doping tests at the 2001 World Nordic skiing championships in Lahti, Finland revealed that Jari Isometsä, Janne Immonen and two other skiers from Finland's gold-medal relay team, Mika Myllylä and Harri Kirvesniemi, and two female skiers tested positive for <b>hydroxyethyl</b> starch (HES), a blood plasma expander usually used {{to cover up the}} use of erythropoietin (EPO). EPO boosts the oxygen-carrying capability of hemoglobin. In addition, the team head coach left needles and drip bags at a public location near the Helsinki airport. At the Sochi Winter Olympic Games, Austrian cross-country skier Johannes Duerr was ejected from competition after testing positive for the blood booster EPO. In 2007, The International Olympic Committee banned biathletes, Wolfgang Perner and Wolfgang Rottmann, and the cross-country skiers, Martin Tauber, Jürgen Pinter, Johannes Eder, Roland Diethart and Christian Hoffmann, from all future Olympic competition.|$|E
25|$|Biochemical and {{structural}} data for E1 revealed a mechanism of activation of TPP coenzyme by forming the conserved hydrogen bond with glutamate residue (Glu59 in human E1) and by imposing a V-conformation {{that brings the}} N4’ atom of the aminopyrimidine to intramolecular hydrogen bonding with the thiazolium C2 atom. This unique combination of contacts and conformations of TPP leads to formation of the reactive C2-carbanion, eventually. After the cofactor TPP decarboxylates pyruvate, the acetyl portion becomes a <b>hydroxyethyl</b> derivative covalently attached to TPP.|$|E
25|$|All {{automotive}} antifreeze formulations, {{including the}} newer organic acid (OAT antifreeze) formulations, are environmentally hazardous {{because of the}} blend of additives (around 5%), including lubricants, buffers and corrosion inhibitors. Because the additives in antifreeze are proprietary, the safety data sheets (SDS) provided by the manufacturer list only those compounds which {{are considered to be}} significant safety hazards when used in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. Common additives include sodium silicate, disodium phosphate, sodium molybdate, sodium borate, denatonium benzoate and dextrin (<b>hydroxyethyl</b> starch). Disodium fluorescein dyes are added to antifreeze to help trace the source of leaks, and as an identifier since some different formulations are incompatible.|$|E
500|$|The UCI {{considered}} a potential revoking of Vacansoleil-DCM's ProTeam licence in mid-February, which {{would stop the}} team from automatically being invited to any World Tour race and be demoted to a Professional Continental team, {{as they were in}} 2010. This licence issue came to light due to continued investigations into doping regarding two of the team's riders; Mosquera and Riccò. Mosquera had tested positive for <b>hydroxyethyl</b> starch at the 2010 Vuelta a España, while Riccò had been admitted to hospital earlier in February, amid allegations that he had carried out a self-administered autologous blood transfusion at his home. (For more information on the Riccò allegations, see the Dismissal of Riccardo Riccò section) ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the team}} had 2010 runner-up Mosquera on their books, they elected not to send him – having been on the team's {{pre-selection}} list – to the race due to the ongoing investigation into his positive doping case for <b>hydroxyethyl</b> starch. Instead, the team elected to place leadership upon the shoulders of Poels, who had taken second place and a stage victory in the Tour de l'Ain, held one week before the Vuelta. The team started with another mediocre performance in the team time trial, coming in 18th of the 22 teams, but Pidgornyy {{was part of a}} successful four-man breakaway on the third stage, and although he eventually finished 15 seconds down on the eventual stage winner Pablo Lastras (...) , Pidgornyy moved into fourth place in the general classification.|$|E
2500|$|Acetaldehyde is {{a common}} {{electrophile}} in organic synthesis. In condensation reactions, acetaldehyde is prochiral. It is used primarily {{as a source of}} the [...] "CH3C+H(OH)" [...] synthon in aldol and related condensation reactions. Grignard reagents and organolithium compounds react with MeCHO to give <b>hydroxyethyl</b> derivatives. In one of the more spectacular condensation reactions, three equivalents of formaldehyde add to MeCHO to give pentaerythritol, C(CH2OH)4.|$|E
2500|$|Thiamine is a colorless {{organosulfur}} compound with {{a chemical}} formula C12H17N4OS. Its structure {{consists of an}} aminopyrimidine and a thiazole ring linked by a methylene bridge. [...] The thiazole is substituted with methyl and <b>hydroxyethyl</b> side chains. [...] Thiamine is soluble in water, methanol, and glycerol and practically insoluble in less polar organic solvents. It is stable at acidic pH, but is unstable in alkaline solutions. [...] Thiamine, which is a N-heterocyclic carbene, {{can be used in}} place of cyanide as a catalyst for benzoin condensation. Thiamine is unstable to heat, but stable during frozen storage. It is unstable when exposed to ultraviolet light and gamma irradiation. Thiamine reacts strongly in Maillard-type reactions.|$|E

50|$|Different {{types of}} <b>hydroxyethyl</b> {{starches}} are typically described by their average molecular weight, typically around 130 to 200 kDa (bearing {{in mind that}} there will be a range of different-sized molecules in any given solution); and their degree of molar substitution (what proportion of the glucose units on the starch molecule have been modified with <b>hydroxyethyl</b> units), typically around 0.35 to 0.5. A solution of <b>hydroxyethyl</b> starch may further be described by its concentration in % (i.e. grams per 100ml). So for example, one commercially available <b>hydroxyethyl</b> starch (Voluven) is described as 6% HES 130 / 0.4.|$|E
50|$|Pentastarch is a {{subgroup}} of <b>hydroxyethyl</b> starch, with five <b>hydroxyethyl</b> groups {{out of each}} 11 hydroxyls, giving it approximately 50% hydroxyethylation. This compares with tetrastarch at 40% and hetastarch at 70% hydroxyethylation, respectively.|$|E

5000|$|In biochemistry, {{a tether}} is a {{molecule}} that carries 1 or 2 carbon intermediates from one active site to another. They {{are commonly used}} in lipid synthesis, gluconeogenesis, conversion of pyruvate into Acetyl CoA via PDH complex. Common tethers are lipoate -lysine residue complex associated with dihydrolipoyl transacetylase, which is used for carrying <b>hydroxyethyl</b> from <b>hydroxyethyl</b> TPP. This compound forms Acetyl- CoA, a convergent molecule in metabolic pathways.|$|E
5000|$|Copolymers of pHEMA {{are still}} widely used today. Poly-HEMA {{functions}} as a hydrogel by rotating around its central carbon. In air, the non-polar methyl side turns outward, making the material brittle and easy to grind into the correct lens shape. In water, the polar <b>hydroxyethyl</b> side turns outward and the material becomes flexible. Pure pHEMA yields lenses that are too thick for sufficient oxygen to diffuse through, so all contact lenses that are pHEMA based are manufactured with copolymers that make the gel thinner and increase its water of hydration. These copolymer hydrogel lenses are often suffixed [...] "-filcon", such as Methafilcon, which is a copolymer of <b>hydroxyethyl</b> methacrylate and methyl methacrylate. Another copolymer hydrogel lens, called Polymacon, is a copolymer of <b>hydroxyethyl</b> methacrylate and Ethylene glycol dimethacrylate.|$|E
