40|$|Using {{horizontal}} sieve-like baffles in fluidized beds {{increases the}} tendency of particle mixtures to segregate. This may be utilized to devise a new process for <b>dry</b> <b>classification</b> of particles according to size or density. To predict the capacity of a continuous classification process based on this principle, the segregation rate must be known {{in addition to the}} final concentration profile. This paper describes an experimental investigation of this, using a fluidized bed with horizontal sieve-like baffles and an equal density mixture. The experiments confirmed that the baffles increase the particle segregation in the bed, and hence, the purity of the flotsam in the top layer. The capacity of a continuous fluidized bed particle classifier and the effect of particle size on the obtainable segregation are discussed. A first modelling attempt to describe the rate of growth of the lower segregation layer is presented. The mechanistic model for axial particle transport proposed in the literature is only partially successful in explaining the experimental results. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

The` main factors in the C 2 CA process which influence the properties of Recycled Aggregates or Recycled Aggregate Concrete (RAC) include the type of Parent Concrete (PC), the intensity of autogenous milling and ADR cut-size point. This study aims to investigate the influence of PC and intensity of the autogenous milling {{on the quality of the}} produced recycled aggregates. Three types of concrete which are frequently demanded in the Dutch market were cast as PC and their fresh and hardened properties were tested. After near one year curing of PC samples, they were recycled independently while the aforementioned recycling factors were varied. The effects of different recycling variables on the water absorption, density, crushing resistance and durability of produced recycled aggregates were investigated. According to the results, type of the parent concrete is the predominant factor influencing the properties of the recycled aggregates. Milling intensity was found to be effective on improving the properties of recycled aggregates coming from weaker parent concrete. The experimental results suggest that among various milling intensities, milling at medium shear and medium compression improves the overall quality of R...|$|E

Fluidization is a process by which a bed of particulate materials exhibts fluid -like behaviour as a result of fluid flowing through it. Fluidization can be carried out by liquids or gases and different forms of fluidization occur {{depending on the type of}} fluidizing medium and the properties of the particulate material, this can have an important effect on the type of processes that can be carried out using fluidization. Typical food processing applications of fluidization include freezing and cooling, drying, puffing, freeze <b>drying,</b> spray <b>drying,</b> <b>classification</b> and blanching and cooking. These processes involve heat and mass transfer to or from the food material, which can be rapidly achieved from fluidization. Food particles are porous and the intraparticle resistances to heat and mass transfer a re usually much higher than the resistance offered by the fluidizing medium. Hence fluidized beds can also be used to determme intra-particle resistances which can then be used to relate to food structure...|$|R

40|$|Narrow {{vegetative}} filter strips (VFS) {{proved to}} effectively reduce herbicide runoff from cultivated fields mainly {{due to the}} ability of vegetation to delay surface runoff, promote infiltration and adsorb herbicides. Since VFS are dynamic systems, their performance would not remain constant over the years indicating the need to define suitable buffer management. In order to evaluate the performance of different five and six year-old VFS, the runoff of the herbicides metolachlor and terbuthylazine was monitored in 2002 and 2003 in an experimental site in northern Italy. The structure of the herbaceous cover in the buffers changes over time. When rows of trees are present, the grass cover is decreased by the shading action of the trees, but the leaf litter gains importance. In VFS with grass cover only, the cover composition changes because of the substitution of grass by broadleaf species. Six metres wide VFS are very effective in reducing runoff volume and concentration during both wet and <b>dry</b> years. <b>Classification</b> analysis showed that runoff concentration and volume are linked to the characteristics of the rainfall event, buffer, source of herbicides and time after application.

The formulation is given completely in terms of potential vorticity, enabling partition of perturbations into Rossby-wave components, just as for the dry problem. Both modal and non-modal development can be understood to a good approximation in terms of propagation and interaction between these components alone.

A total of 23 subjects used a P 300 BCI to spell the word “LUCAS ” while receiving real-time, closed-loop feedback. The <b>dry</b> system yielded <b>classification</b> accuracies that were similar to those obtained with gel systems. All subjects completed a questionnaire after data recording, and all subjects stated that the dry system was not uncomfortable. This is the first field validation of a dry electrode P 300 BCI system, and paves the way for new research and development with EEG recording systems that are much more practical and convenient in field settings than conventional systems.

40|$|M. urundeuva (Fr. All.) is a tree {{currently}} {{listed as}} endangered species of Brazilian Flora since 1992, nevertheless, it manifest monodominance {{in some regions}} of Minas Gerais state, especially in middle Rio Doce. The aim of this work is to evaluate the maximum likelihood (Maxlike) performances to classify forest fragments monodominated by M. urundeuva at Tumiritinga, Minas Gerais, using RapidEye images in different seasons. The accuracy assessment of thematic maps derived from image classi&# 64257;cation was made by Kappa and conditional Kappa coef&# 64257;cients and analysis of confusion matrix. Dry and rainy season images produced good performances getting Kappa index between 80 and 85 and conditional Kappa index between 82 and 94. The greatest errors of rainy season image classification for aroeira monominant class {{were related to the}} native forest and managed pasture. The greatest errors of <b>dry</b> season image <b>classification</b> for aroeira monominant class were related to the rock outcrop class. The accuracy for aroeira monodominant classification can be improved if you have images by different seasons. However, if its not possible, the dry season image provides the best data to classify forest fragments monodominated by M. urundeuva. The thematic map produced show that 20 % of the town is under occupation of M. urundeuva in monodominance and this specie is not endangered in Tumiritinga, Minas Gerais. Pages: 2988 - 299...|$|R
40|$|Prosopis juliflora is a drought-tolerant {{fast-growing tree}} species {{originating}} from South and Central America {{with a high}} invasion potential in arid and semi-arid areas. It was introduced in Somaliland in the 1980 s, and {{is reported to have}} spread vigorously since. Despite being recognised as a serious issue in the country, the actual scale of the problem is unknown. In this study, we mapped the species in a study area that includes the capital, Hargeisa, using Landsat 8 satellite imagery. During a field campaign in 2015 we collected canopy-level spectral signatures of P. juliflora and native trees, to analyse the potential use of spectral data in discriminating the invasive species. P. juliflora was found to be generally distinguishable because of its greater vigour during the <b>dry</b> season. Nevertheless, <b>classification</b> is challenging as similar spectral responses were observed for P. juliflora and native tree species in situations where the former grows under severe water limitations while more favourable conditions exist for the native trees. We tested the accuracy of the Random Forest classifier and different classification set-ups, varying the spatial resolution (original 30 m vs. pan-sharpened 15 m) and image acquisition dates (during the wet season, the dry season and a combination of the two). Best overall accuracy (84 %) was achieved using pan-sharpened data from the two seasons. About 30 years since its introduction, the invasive species was detected in 9 % of the total investigated area with highest occurrence in the proximity of human settlements and along seasonal water courses.

40|$|Background and Purpose: No {{previous}} field {{investigations have}} been conducted on the biology and ecology of the native population of golden jackals (Canis aureus L.) from Dalmatia. The object {{of this study was}} to determine the feeding habits of this poorly studied population. Materials and Methods: The diet composition of golden jackals from Dalmatia was examined by scat analysis. From winter 1995 to spring 1997, field visits were made every season to the golden jackal habitat on the Pelješac Peninsula in Dalmatia, Croatia and scats of golden jackals were collected (n= 130). Scats were washed out, <b>dried</b> and sorted. <b>Classification</b> of components was made under appropriate magnification. Conclusions: Both animal and plant components were found. Scat included from one to four components. The highest frequency was found for mammals (50. 3 %) followed by fruit seeds and vegetables (34. 1 %), insects (29. 5 %), birds (including eggs; 24. 8 %), artificial materials (24 %) and branches, leaves and grass (24 %). In scats containing mammal remains, the highest incidence was for large mammals (unidentified large mammals of the order Artiodactyla and Lagomorpha). Small mammals were found but in a negligible frequency. The most important fruits for jackals are Ficus carica L. (14 %), Vitis vinifera L. (14 %) and Juniperus oxicedrus L. (4. 6 %). The most important orders of insects are Orthoptera (16 %), Coleoptera (12 %) and Dyctioptera (3 %), and for birds order Charadriiformes (6 %). The negligible amount of small mammals found in scats differed from the majority of investigations carried out elsewhere. Results: The results show the close relation of the population with human settlements and regional agricultural habits...|$|R
