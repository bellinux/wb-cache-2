5|$|<b>Dubnium</b> is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Db and atomic number 105. <b>Dubnium</b> is highly radioactive: {{the most stable}} known isotope, dubnium-268, has a half-life of just over a day. This greatly limits the extent of research on <b>dubnium.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table of the elements, <b>dubnium</b> is located in group 5 as the third member of the 6d series of transition metals. Limited investigation of <b>dubnium</b> chemistry has demonstrated that <b>dubnium</b> behaves as a typical group 5 element and the heavier homologue to tantalum; however, some deviations from periodic trends occur due to relativistic effects.|$|E
5|$|Next {{studies of}} the {{chemistry}} of <b>dubnium</b> were reported over a decade later, in 1988. Studies at Berkeley examined whether the most stable oxidation state of <b>dubnium</b> in aqueous solution was +5. <b>Dubnium</b> was fumed twice and washed with concentrated nitric acid; then, its sorption of <b>dubnium</b> on glass cover slips was {{compared with that of}} tracers of the group 5 elements niobium and tantalum and the group 4 elements zirconium and hafnium produced on‐line under similar conditions. The group 5 elements are known to sorb on glass surfaces while the group 4 elements do not. <b>Dubnium</b> was confirmed as a group 5 member. However, it was surprising that behavior on extraction from mixed nitric acid/hydrofluoric acid solution into methyl isobutyl ketones differed between <b>dubnium,</b> tantalum, and niobium. <b>Dubnium</b> did not extract and its behavior resembled niobium more closely than tantalum, indicating that details of complexing behavior could not be predicted based only on simple extrapolations of trends within a group in the periodic table.|$|E
5|$|While the {{remaining}} valence electrons in a singly ionized <b>dubnium</b> ion (Db+) organize {{themselves in a}} 6d27s2 configuration, the doubly (Db2+) or triply (Db3+) ionized atoms eliminate the 7s electrons, the opposite order to that of its lighter homologs. Despite the changes, however, <b>dubnium</b> is still expected to use five electrons as its valence electrons; 7p energy levels have not been shown to influence <b>dubnium</b> and its properties. As the 6d orbitals of <b>dubnium</b> are more destabilized than the 5d ones of tantalum, and Db3+ {{is expected to have}} two d, rather than s, electrons remaining, the resulting oxidation state is expected to be unstable and even rarer than that of tantalum. The ionization potential of <b>dubnium</b> in its maximum oxidation state should be slightly lower than that of tantalum and the ionic radius of <b>dubnium</b> should increase compared to tantalum; this has a significant effect on dubnium's chemistry (see below).|$|E
5|$|If a {{large number}} of <b>dubnium</b> atoms were to gather {{together}} as a solid, they should arrange themselves in a body-centered cubic configuration, like the previous group 5 elements. The predicted density of <b>dubnium</b> is 29g/cm3.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} {{case for}} computational chemistry is the gas-phase chemistry, {{in which a}} substance is treated {{as if it was}} a gas to eliminate the necessity of taking interactions between molecules in account. Research by multiple authors has been undertaken on <b>dubnium</b> pentachloride: it has been calculated to be consistent with the periodic laws by exhibiting properties of a compound of a d-block element. For example, the molecular orbital levels indicate <b>dubnium</b> uses three 6d electron levels as expected. One property <b>dubnium</b> pentachloride is expected to show is its increased (compared to its tantalum analog) covalence: a decrease in the effective charge on an atom and an increase in the overlap population (between orbitals of <b>dubnium</b> and chlorine).|$|E
5|$|Calculations for {{solution}} chemistry {{indicate that}} again, the maximum oxidation state of <b>dubnium,</b> +5, {{will be more}} stable than that of niobium and tantalum, and the +3 state will be less stable than those of niobium and tantalum. The propensity towards hydrolysis of cations in the highest oxidation state {{is expected to continue}} to decrease within group 5; however, it is still expected to be quite rapid. Complexation of <b>dubnium</b> is expected to follow group 5 trends in its richness. Calculations for hydroxo-chlorido- complexes have been conducted; they show reversal in the trends of complex formation and extraction of group 5 elements, with <b>dubnium</b> being more prone to do so than tantalum.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dubnium</b> {{with its}} atomic number 105 is a superheavy element; like all {{elements}} of such high atomic number, it is highly unstable. The most stable known isotope of <b>dubnium,</b> 268Db, has a half-life of around a day. Thus, {{even if it had}} once existed on Earth, it would have decayed completely long ago and can only be obtained by artificial production.|$|E
5|$|In 2004–05, {{researchers}} from Dubna and Livermore identified a new <b>dubnium</b> isotope, 268Db, as a fivefold alpha decay {{product of the}} newly created element 115. This new isotope proved to be long-lived enough to allow chemical experimentation. In the 2004 experiment, a thin layer {{was removed from the}} surface of the target (with <b>dubnium</b> on it), dissolved in aqua regia with tracers and lanthanum carrier, from which precipitated various +3, +4, and +5 species on adding ammonium hydroxide. The precipitate was washed and dissolved in hydrochloric acid, in which it was converted to nitrate form then dried on a film and counted. It mostly contained a +5 species, which was immediately assigned to <b>dubnium,</b> but also a +4 species; based on that result, the team decided that additional chemical separation was needed. In 2005, the experiment was repeated, with the final product being hydroxide rather than nitrate precipitate, which was processed further at both Livermore (based on reverse phase chromatography) and Dubna (based on anion exchange chromatography). The +5 species was effectively isolated; <b>dubnium</b> in that experiment appeared three times in tantalum-only fractions and not even once in niobium-only fractions. However, it was noted that these experiments were insufficient to draw conclusions about the general chemical profile of <b>dubnium.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to the {{periodic}} law, <b>dubnium</b> should belong to group 5, under vanadium, niobium, and tantalum. Several studies investigated {{the properties of}} element 105 and found a general agreement with the predictions from {{the periodic}} law. Significant deviations may nevertheless occur, due to relativistic effects, which dramatically change physical properties on both atomic and macroscopic scales. (Relativistic effects arise when an object moves on velocities comparable to the speed of light; in heavy atoms, the quickly moving objects are electrons revolving around the nucleus.) These properties have remained challenging to measure: studies have only been performed on single atoms; they generally confirm the assignment of <b>dubnium</b> to the position under tantalum in the periodic table.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dubnium</b> {{does not}} occur {{naturally}} on Earth and is produced artificially. The first discovery of the element was claimed by the Soviet Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in 1968, followed in 1970 by the American University of California. Both teams proposed their names for the new element and used them without formal approval. The long-standing dispute was resolved in 1993 by an official investigation of the discovery claims by the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party, resulting in credit for discovery being officially shared between both teams. The element was officially named <b>dubnium</b> in 1997 after the town of Dubna, {{the site of the}} JINR.|$|E
5|$|While it yet {{remains to}} be seen if there are principally more stable isotopes, there has not any theoretical, let alone practical, {{suggestion}} this could be the case. In a 2012 calculation by the JINR, it was suggested that the half-lives of all <b>dubnium</b> isotopes, synthesized or not, would not significantly exceed a day.|$|E
5|$|A more {{indirect}} {{effect would be}} that the contracted s and p1/2 orbitals shield (take on themselves) the charge of the nucleus more effectively, leaving even less for the outer d and f electrons, which therefore move on larger orbitals. <b>Dubnium</b> is greatly affected by this: unlike the previous group 5 members, its 7s electrons are more difficult to extract from an atom than the 6d electrons, though these energy levels remain close to each other.|$|E
5|$|Francium {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{unstable}} of the naturally occurring elements: its longest-lived isotope, francium-223, has a half-life of only 22minutes. The only comparable element is astatine, whose most stable natural isotope, astatine-219 (the alpha daughter of francium-223), has a half-life of 56seconds, although synthetic astatine-210 is much longer-lived with a half-life of 8.1hours. All isotopes of francium decay into astatine, radium, or radon. Francium-223 also has a shorter half-life than the longest-lived isotope of each synthetic element up to and including element 105, <b>dubnium.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1871, Dmitri Mendeleev {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} an element between thorium and uranium. The actinide element group was unknown at the time. Therefore, uranium was positioned below tungsten in group VI, and thorium below zirconium in group IV, leaving the space below tantalum in group V empty and, until the 1950s, periodic tables were published with this structure. For a long time chemists searched for eka-tantalum as an element with similar chemical properties to tantalum, making a discovery of protactinium nearly impossible. Tantalum's heavier analogue was later found to be the transuranic element <b>dubnium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Irradiation of 241Am by 12C or 22Ne ions {{yields the}} {{isotopes}} 247Es (einsteinium) or 260Db (<b>dubnium),</b> respectively. Furthermore, the element berkelium (243Bk isotope) had been first intentionally produced and identified by bombarding 241Am with alpha particles, in 1949, {{by the same}} Berkeley group, using the same 60-inch cyclotron. Similarly, nobelium was produced at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Dubna, Russia, in 1965 in several reactions, one of which included irradiation of 243Am with 15N ions. Besides, one of the synthesis reactions for lawrencium, discovered by scientists at Berkeley and Dubna, included bombardment of 243Am with 18O.|$|E
5|$|The German group {{suggested}} the name nielsbohrium with symbol Ns {{to honor the}} Danish physicist Niels Bohr. The Soviet scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia had suggested this name be given to element 105 (which was finally called <b>dubnium)</b> and the German team wished to recognise both Bohr {{and the fact that}} the Dubna team had been the first to propose the cold fusion reaction to solve the controversial problem of the naming of element 105. The Dubna team agreed with the German group's naming proposal for element 107.|$|E
5|$|The lightest {{isotopes}} were synthesized {{by direct}} fusion between two lighter nuclei and as decay products. The heaviest isotope produced by direct fusion is 262Rf; heavier isotopes {{have only been}} observed as decay products of elements with larger atomic numbers, of which only 267Rf has been confirmed. The heavy isotopes 266Rf and 268Rf have also been observed as electron capture daughters of the <b>dubnium</b> isotopes 266Db and 268Db, but have short half-lives to spontaneous fission: {{it seems likely that}} the same is true of 270Rf, a likely daughter of 270Db. While the isotope 264Rf has yet to be observed, it is predicted to have a short half-life of 5s.|$|E
5|$|While {{the lightest}} (252Lr to 254Lr) and {{heaviest}} (266Lr) lawrencium isotopes are produced only as alpha decay products of <b>dubnium</b> (Z=105) isotopes, the middle isotopes (255Lr to 262Lr) {{can all be}} produced by bombarding actinide (americium to einsteinium) targets with light ions (from boron to neon). The two most important isotopes, 256Lr and 260Lr, are both in this range. 256Lr can be produced by bombarding californium-249 with 70MeV boron-11 ions (producing lawrencium-256 and four neutrons), while 260Lr can be produced by bombarding berkelium-249 with oxygen-18 (producing lawrencium-260, an alpha particle, and three neutrons).|$|E
5|$|Two groups claimed {{discovery}} of the element. Evidence of bohrium was first reported in 1976 by a Russian research team led by Yuri Oganessian, in which targets of bismuth-209 and lead-208 were bombarded with accelerated nuclei of chromium-54 and manganese-55 respectively. Two activities, one with a half-life of one to two milliseconds, {{and the other with}} an approximately five-second half-life, were seen. Since the ratio of the intensities of these two activities was constant throughout the experiment, it was proposed that the first was from the isotope bohrium-261 and that the second was from its daughter dubnium-257. Later, the <b>dubnium</b> isotope was corrected to dubnium-258, which indeed has a five-second half-life (dubnium-257 has a one-second half-life); however, the half-life observed for its parent is much shorter than the half-lives later observed in the definitive {{discovery of}} bohrium at Darmstadt in 1981. The IUPAC/IUPAP Transfermium Working Group (TWG) concluded that while dubnium-258 was probably seen in this experiment, the evidence for the production of its parent bohrium-262 was not convincing enough.|$|E
25|$|Hahn's death did {{not stop}} his public acclamation. Proposals were made at {{different}} times, first in 1971 by American chemists, that the newly synthesized element no. 105 should be named hahnium in Hahn's honor; in 1997 the IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) named it <b>dubnium,</b> after the Russian research center in Dubna (see element naming controversy). Although element 108 was given the name hassium (after Hesse) by its officially-recognized German discoverers in 1992, a 1994 IUPAC committee recommended that it be named hahnium (Hn), {{in spite of the}} long-standing convention to give the discoverer the right to suggest a name. This recommendation was not adopted, following protests from the German discoverers, and the name hassium (Hs) was adopted internationally in 1997.|$|E
500|$|This {{prompted}} {{further exploration}} of the chemical behavior of complexes of <b>dubnium.</b> Thousands of repetitive chromatographic experiments were performed jointly in various labs between 1988 and 1993. All group 5 elements and protactinium were extracted from concentrated hydrochloric acid; at lower concentrations of hydrogen chloride, small amounts of hydrogen fluoride were added to start selective re-extraction. <b>Dubnium</b> showed a behavior {{different from that of}} tantalum at concentrations of hydrogen chloride below 12 moles, following the behavior of niobium and the pseudohomolog protactinium. Because of this similarity to these two elements, the research suggested that the formed complex was either [...] or [...] After extraction experiments of <b>dubnium</b> from hydrogen bromide into diisobutyl carbinol (2,6-dimethylheptan-4-ol), a specific extractant for protactinium, with subsequent elutions with the hydrogen chloride/hydrogen fluoride mix as well as hydrogen chloride, <b>dubnium</b> was found to be less prone to extraction than both protactinium and niobium. It was explained as an increasing tendency to form non‐extractable complexes of multiple negative charges. Further experiments in 1992 confirmed the stability of the +5 state: Db(V) was shown to be extractable from cation‐exchange columns with α‐hydroxyisobutyrate, similarly to other group 5 elements and protactinium; Db(III) and Db(IV) were not. In 1998 and 1999, new predictions suggested <b>dubnium</b> would extract nearly as well as niobium and better than tantalum from halide solutions, which was later confirmed.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, another anion-exchange {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} Japan at the JAEA tandem accelerator. <b>Dubnium</b> was processed to a nitric acid/hydrofluoric acid solution, with concentrations at which niobium forms [...] and tantalum forms [...] Dubnium's behavior was close to that of niobium but not tantalum; thus, it was deduced that it formed [...] It was concluded that the available information that <b>dubnium</b> often behaved like niobium, sometimes like protactinium, but rarely as tantalum.|$|E
500|$|Experimental {{results of}} studies of the {{chemistry}} of <b>dubnium</b> date back to 1974 and 1976. Dubna researchers used a [...] system {{and concluded that the}} volatility of <b>dubnium</b> bromide was less than that of niobium bromide and about {{the same as that of}} hafnium bromide. It is not certain, however, that the detected fission products confirmed that the parent was indeed element 105. This may imply that the new element behaved more like hafnium than niobium.|$|E
500|$|In May 1970, JINR {{published}} a further report on <b>dubnium.</b> In the follow-up research, further syntheses of <b>dubnium</b> were performed. It {{was reported that}} the previous syntheses were confirmed; according to the paper, the isotope produced in Dubna was probably 261105, though the possibility of it being 260105 was not excluded. [...] The report included initial chemical examination: the thermal gradient version of the gas-chromatography method was applied {{to demonstrate that the}} chloride of what formed the SF activity nearly matched that of niobium pentachloride, rather than hafnium tetrachloride; therefore, this directed to an assignment to element 105. The team identified a 2.2-second spontaneous fission activity contained within a volatile chloride portraying eka-tantalum properties.|$|E
500|$|The first {{isothermal}} {{gas chromatography}} experiments were performed in 1992 with 262Db (half-life 35 seconds). The volatilities for niobium and tantalum were similar within error limits, but <b>dubnium</b> {{appeared to be}} significantly less volatile. It was postulated that traces of oxygen in the system might have led to formation of , which was predicted to be less volatile than [...] Later experiments in 1996 showed that group 5 chlorides were more volatile than the corresponding bromides, {{with the exception of}} tantalum, presumably due to formation of [...] Later volatility studies of chlorides of <b>dubnium</b> and niobium as a function of controlled partial pressures of oxygen showed that formation of oxychlorides and general volatility are dependent on concentrations of oxygen. The oxychlorides were shown to be less volatile than the chlorides.|$|E
500|$|The Dubna–Livermore {{collaboration}} strengthened {{their claim}} to the discoveries of moscovium and nihonium by conducting chemical experiments on the final decay product 268Db.

500|$|As a {{consequence}} of the initial competing claims of discovery, an element naming controversy arose. Since the Soviets claimed to have first detected the new element they suggested the name kurchatovium (Ku) in honor of Igor Kurchatov (1903–1960), former head of Soviet nuclear research. This name had been used in books of the Soviet Bloc as the official name of the element. The Americans, however, proposed rutherfordium (Rf) for the new element to honor Ernest Rutherford, who is known as the [...] "father" [...] of nuclear physics. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) adopted unnilquadium (Unq) as a temporary, systematic element name, derived from the Latin names for digits 1, 0, and 4. In 1994, IUPAC suggested the name <b>dubnium</b> (Db) to be used since rutherfordium was suggested for element 106 and IUPAC felt that the Dubna team should be rightly recognized for their contributions. However, there was still a dispute over the names of elements 104–107. In 1997 the teams involved resolved the dispute and adopted the current name rutherfordium. The name <b>dubnium</b> was given to element 105 at the same time.|$|E
500|$|The Dubna–Livermore {{collaboration}} strengthened {{their claim}} for {{the discovery of}} nihonium by conducting chemical experiments on 268Db, the final decay product of 288Mc.

500|$|Another {{effect is}} the spin–orbit interaction, {{particularly}} the spin–orbit splitting, which in application to <b>dubnium</b> splits the 6d subshell—the azimuthal quantum number ℓ for a dshell is 2—into two subshells, with {{four of the}} ten orbitals having their ℓ lowered to 3/2 and six raised to 5/2.
