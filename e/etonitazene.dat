50|$|A 2011 {{publication}} Org. Chem., 2011, 76(23), 9577-9583 from a South Korean team {{outlined a}} novel, one-pot synthesis for substituted and unsubstituted 2-benzyl-benzimidazoles {{that can be}} easily adapted to the preparation of <b>etonitazene.</b> The three component synthesis of the direct <b>etonitazene</b> precursor, 2-(4-Ethoxybenzyl)-5-nitro-1H-benzoimidazole, consists of a 2-Bromo- or 2-Iodo-5-nitro-phenylamine (1.0 molar equivalent), a 4-substituted benzaldehyde (1.2 equiv), and sodium azide (2 equiv). The 2-Halo-5-nitro-phenylamine requires a bromo or iodo group for optimal activity. 2-Chloro-phenylamines are completely unreactive. In addition to these three components, the reaction was optimized in the presence of 0.05 molar equivalents (5 mol%) of a catalyst, copper(I) chloride, and 5 mol% of ligand, TMEDA (tetramethylethylenediamine). After heating these components at 120 °C for 12 hours in DMSO, the direct <b>etonitazene</b> precursor, 2-(4-Ethoxybenzyl)-5-nitro-1H-benzoimidazole, was formed in an approx 80-90% yield. The secondary amine nitrogen of 2-(4-Ethoxybenzyl)-5-nitro-1H-benzoimidazole was then alkylated with (2-Chloroethyl)diethylamine to form <b>etonitazene.</b> A diagram of this synthesis is shown below.|$|E
50|$|<b>Etonitazene</b> {{has proved}} very {{important}} in mapping out the opiate receptor and some experimental compounds in which phenolic groupings have been replaced with nitro groupings have proved more active than the parent compound.|$|E
50|$|A {{particularly}} novel, high-yielding {{synthesis of}} <b>etonitazene</b> {{was developed by}} FI Carroll and MC Coleman in the mid-1970s The authors were tasked with the preparation of large quantities of <b>etonitazene,</b> but found the conventional synthesis to be inadequate. The problem with the conventional synthesis was the lability of the imino ether reactant, 2-(4-Ethoxyphenyl)-acetimidic acid ethyl ester (prepared by reacting 4-ethoxyphenylacetonitrile with ethanolic HCl). The imino ether necessitated the use of anhydrous reaction conditions and was inconvenient to prepare in large quantities. This led the authors to experiment {{with the use of}} a coupling reagent, EEDQ (N-Ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline), in order to promote the condensation of 2-(2-diethylaminoethylamino)-5-nitroaniline with 4-ethoxyphenylacetic acid. Incredibly, the authors discovered that when this condensation was performed in the presence of 2 or more molar equivalents of EEDQ (added portionwise in 3 steps) in THF at 50 °C for 192 hours (8 days), a near quantitative yield (100%) of <b>etonitazene</b> was obtained. In addition to the impressive improvement in yield over the conventional procedure, the work up procedure was greatly simplified since quinoline, carbon dioxide, and ethanol were the only by-products formed. A diagram of this procedure is shown below.|$|E
50|$|<b>Etonitazene</b> is {{a potent}} {{analgesic}} drug shown to be approximately 1000-1500x the potency of morphine in animal models but only 60x in man. It {{is one of several}} benzimidazole opioids, and is structurally related to clonitazene (where the p-ethoxybenzyl group is replaced by a p-chlorobenzyl group; however, clonitazene itself has only 3x the potency of morphine).|$|E
50|$|Clonitazene is an opioid {{analgesic}} of approximately {{three times the}} potency of morphine. It is related to <b>etonitazene,</b> an opioid of significantly higher potency. Clonitazene is not currently marketed. It is a controlled substance; in the United States it is a Schedule I Narcotic controlled substance with a DEA ACSCN of 9612 and an annual manufacturing quota of zero.|$|E
50|$|Benzimidazoles {{are often}} bioactive. Many {{anthelmintic}} drugs (albendazole, mebendazole, triclabendazole etc.) {{belong to the}} benzimidazole class of compounds. Benzimidazole fungicides are commercialized. They act by binding to the fungal microtubules and stopping hyphal growth. It also binds to the spindle microtubules and blocks nuclear division..The benzimidazole opioid family includes a number of strong agents e.g. <b>etonitazene,</b> whose article discusses the family in some depth.|$|E
50|$|Of these analogues, only <b>etonitazene</b> and {{clonitazene}} are explicitly {{listed as}} illegal drugs under UN convention {{and so are}} illegal throughout the world. The rest would only be illegal {{in countries such as}} the USA, Australia and New Zealand that have laws equivalent to the Federal Analog Act. In the United States it is a Schedule I Narcotic controlled substance with a DEA ACSCN of 9624 and a zero annual manufacturing quota as of 2013.|$|E
50|$|The most {{versatile}} synthesis {{developed by the}} Swiss team first involved alkylation of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene with 1-amino-2-diethylaminoethane to form N-(β-Diethylaminoethyl)-2,4-dinitroaniline N'-(2,4-Dinitrophenyl)-N,N-diethyl-ethane-1,2-diamine. The 2-nitro substituent on the 2,4-dinitroaniline compound is then selectively reduced to the corresponding primary amine by utilizing ammonium sulfide as the reducing agent. The ammonium sulfide can be formed in situ {{by the addition of}} concentrated aqueous ammonium hydroxide followed by saturation of the solution with hydrogen sulfide gas. The intermediate formed by the selective reduction of the 2-nitro substituent, 2-(β-Diethylaminoethylamino)-5-nitroaniline, is then reacted with the hydrochloride salt of the imino ethyl ether of 4-ethoxyphenylacetonitrile (aka: p-ethoxybenzyl cyanide). The imino ether, 2-(4-Ethoxyphenyl)-acetimidic acid ethyl ester hydrochloride, is prepared by dissolving the 4-substituted benzyl cyanide in a mixture of anhydrous ethanol and chloroform and then saturating this solution with dry hydrogen chloride gas. The reaction between the 2-(β-dialkylaminoalkylamine)-5-nitroaniline and the HCl salt of the imino ethyl ether results in the formation of <b>etonitazene.</b> This procedure is particularly useful in the preparation of the 4-, 5-, 6-, and 7-nitrobenzimidazoles. Varying the choice of the substituted phenylacetic acid imino ether affords compounds with a diversity of substituents on the benzene ring at the 2- position. A diagram of this particular synthesis as it applies to the preparation of <b>etonitazene</b> is shown below.|$|E
50|$|<b>Etonitazene</b> and its related opioid agonist benzimidazoles were {{discovered}} in the late 1950s, {{by a team of}} Swiss researchers working at the pharmaceutical firm CIBA (now Novartis). One of the first compounds investigated by the Swiss team was 1-(β-diethylaminoethyl)-2-benzylbenzimidazole, which was found to possess 10% of the analgesic activity of morphine when tested in rodent bioassays. This finding encouraged the group to begin a comprehensive systematic study of 2-benzylbenzimidazoles and to establish the structure-activity relationship of this new family of analgesics. Two general synthetic methods were developed for the preparation of these compounds.|$|E
5000|$|Illicit {{production}} {{and sale of}} <b>etonitazene</b> has been limited. This compound was identified on the illegal drug market in Moscow in 1998, {{appeared to have been}} illicitly manufactured, and was primarily smoked as pre-laced cigarettes. In another case a chemist at Morton Thiokol called Thomas K Highsmith [...] produced the compound and placed it in a nasal inhaler. The drug was produced in Russia in 1996 and sold as 'Chinese Dwarf'. The drug resulted in an unconfirmed number of deaths simply because the potency in man wasn't known. It appears to have a steep dose-response curve [...] making it particularly hazardous, more so than even fentanyl.|$|E

40|$|Hitherto {{the term}} for {{addiction}} in studies on animals was normally {{used to describe the}} observation of a preference development. It was not until the beginning of the nineties that various authors started to lay down further criteria for the study of behavioural dependence. WOLFFGRAMM and HEYNE (1995) described for the first time an animal model for the induction of behavioural dependence of rats to various addictive drugs. This was examined against the criteria that had been layed down by them. Within studies of MÜLLER (2001) and PIRK (2002) {{it was not possible to}} reproduce these findings. That is why in this study - after further modifications had been made to the animal model described - an attempt was made to induct behavioural dependence on alcohol and the µ-opiate agonist <b>etonitazene</b> in male and female Wistar rats. The alcohol was presented to the animals in the framework of a "free-choice-model", either at regular intermittent intervals (48 hour rhythm) with an initial high dose (20 %), or at irregular intermittant intervals with changing concentrations or in regular increased alcohol concentrations. After about 30 - 46 weeks of exposition to alcohol the development of behavioural dependence was examined against the criteria of WOLFFGRAMM and HEYNE. The <b>etonitazene</b> solution (2, 0 µg/ml) was presented similarly to the rats as in the experiments with the alcohol in the framework of a "free-choice-model", either at regular intermittant intervals (48 hour rhythm), or as continuous availability. In a further experiment the <b>etonitazene</b> solution was readily available by forced presentation in increased concentrations (in approxymately 31 weeks an increase from 0, 2 µg/ml to 2, 0 µg/ml). Depending on the experiment after 17 to 48 weeks of exposition to <b>etonitazene</b> an examination of the behavioural dependence was caried out against the criteria of WOLFFGRAMM and HEYNE. In the experiments with alcohol the rats actually developed a preference for it (especially during the regular intermittent doses of initially 20 % a massive increase in consumption of up to 24, 31 ml/kg bodyweight/d was induced), however, with the additional offer of saccharose-water all of the animals reduced their alcohol consumption considerably. None of the rats proved to have developed behavioural dependence. In the course of the experiments with <b>etonitazene</b> an increase in consumption could not be established even after many weeks of exposition. The animals did not develop any behavioural dependence on <b>etonitazene</b> but rather an apparent aversion to the drug. To summarize it was established that even after further modification of the animal model according to WOLFFGRAMM and HEYNE (1995) and in the framework of this study, neither behavioural dependence on alcohol or on the µ-opiate agonist <b>etonitazene</b> could be induced. Therefore this study confirms the results of the experiments carried out by MÜLLER (2001) as well as those of PIRK (2002) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{antagonist}} {{effects of}} clocinnamox were evaluated against opioid agonists, acting at μ, κ and ∂-receptors, in rhesus monkeys (n = 3 – 4) responding under a fixed-ratio 30 (FR 30) schedule for food delivery. Clocinnamox (0. 032 – 0. 1 mg/kg) dose-dependently antagonized fentanyl (0. 001 – 0. 32 mg/kg) after either a 3 -h or 1 -day pretreatment; there was substantial recovery of agonist potency by 1 week after clocinnamox. <b>Etonitazene</b> (0. 0001 – 0. 01 mg/kg) was also antagonized by clocinnamox (0. 1 mg/kg), {{but to a}} lesser extent than fentanyl. The smaller extent of antagonism was not due to the appearance of non μ-opioid response-decreasing effects of <b>etonitazene,</b> since the competitive antagonist quadazocine (0. 1 mg/kg) shifted the <b>etonitazene</b> dose-effect curve in the presence of clocinnamox (0. 1 mg/kg). Clocinnamox (0. 1 – 0. 32 mg/kg) did not antagonize the rate-suppressing effects of the ∂-agonist BW 373 U 86 (0. 0. 01 - 1. 0 mg/kg) or the κ-agonist U 69, 593 (0. 001 – 0. 032 mg/kg).

40|$|Reinstatement of {{responding}} previously maintained by cocaine was measured after noncontingent “priming ” injections of co-caine, the opiold partial agonist buprenorphine, the opioid antag-onist naltrexone and the oploid agonist <b>etonitazene.</b> The effects of pretreatment with buprenorphine, naltrexone or <b>etonitazene</b> on the reinstatement {{of responding}} {{produced by a}} priming injec-tion of cocaine were also evaluated. The rats were trained to respond on a lever under a fixed-ratio 1 schedule to receive i. v. infusions of cocaine (1. 0 mg kg 1 infusion 1) for the initial 2 hr during daily 7 -hr sessions. Saline replaced cocaine at the begin-fling of hour 3, which resulted in an extinction of responding during the third hour {{and low levels of}} responding during the subsequent 4 hr of the session. Priming i. v. injections of cocaine (0. 4 - 3. 2 mg/kg), but not buprenorphine (0. 025 - 0. 4 mg/kg), nal-trexone (1. 6 and 3. 2 mg/kg) or <b>etonitazene</b> (2. 5 and 5. 0 pg/kg), administered at the beginning of hour 4 of the session (i. e., during the extinction period), produced a dose-related reinstate-ment of responding. Pretreatment with either buprenorphine (0. 025 - 0. 4 mg/kg) or <b>etonitazene</b> (2. 5 and 5. 0,g/kg), but not naltrexone (1. 6 and 3. 2 mg/kg), produced a dose-related suppression of the reinstatement of responding produced by 3. 2 mg/kg of cocaine. These results indicate that 1) buprenorphine and naltrexone have little potential for producing reinstatement of responding in cocaine-maintained rats and 2) buprenorphine’s effectiveness in preventing a reinstatement of responding pro-duced by a cocaine priming injection may be related to its oploid agonist actions.

40|$|WOLFFGRAMM and HEYNE {{described}} {{for the first}} time in 1995 an animal model to induce behavioural dependence in rats. Other authors could not repeat their results (MÜLLER 2000). That is the reason why we investigated the influence of presenting alcohol and an opioid (<b>etonitazene)</b> in palatable (sweet) fluids to the induction of behavioural dependence on these drugs in rats in an animal model based on the results of WOLFFGRAMM et al. and MÜLLER. For all experiments male Wistar rats were used. In the first experiment the rats had the choice between two different alcohol concentrations (5 % and 15 %) in sweet fluids (strawberry or sugar taste) and tap water presented either all the time or every 24 hours for one day. After week 45 the alcohol was presented only in tap water until the end of the experiment (week 58). To check the development of behavioural depend-ence the alcoholic solutions were mixed with a bitter substance (quinine) or another bottle with the sweet fluid without alcohol was placed to the disposal. The consumed amount of alcohol decreased steadily. When the sweet fluid was replaced by tap water the decrease was even more impressive. After addition of quinine or presentation of another bottle with sweet fluid the rats nearly stopped the ingestion of the alcoholic solution. In the second experiment the rats were treated similar to those of the first experiment. They had the choice between a sweet alcoholic solution with a concentration of 20 % and tap water over 32 weeks. After week 32 the alcohol was presented in tap water. From week 36 until the end (week 44) the concentration of the alcohol was increased to 30 %. The consumption of alcohol decreased over the course of the trial and also every time the alcohol was mixed with quinine or another bottle with sweet fluid was presented. Altogether in both experiments none of the animals showed signs of behavioural dependence to alcohol during the course of the trial. For the third experiment raising concentrations of an opioid (<b>etonitazene,</b> ETZ) were pre-sented to the rats in sweet fluids. The schedule was similar to the other experiments. From week 25 to 28 the animals were deprived from the drug. After week 33 until the end (week 44) ETZ was soluted in tap water. The same tests as before to control the development of behav-ioural dependence were done. Until the weeks of drug deprivation the rats increased the consumed amount and decreased only few their drug intake during the control tests. But after replacement of the sweet fluid by tap water the rats showed an enormous and continuous decrease of the drug intake. Therefore even in this experiment with ETZ no behavioural dependence in the animals could be induced To conclude, we can say that even with some changes as the presentation of the drug in sweet fluid this animal model is not reliable to induce behavioural dependence in the rats. <br /...|$|E
