5|$|Alprazolam is {{effective}} in the relief of moderate to severe anxiety and panic attacks. However, {{it is not a}} <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>treatment</b> since the development of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Alprazolam is no longer recommended in Australia for the treatment of panic disorder due to concerns regarding tolerance, dependence, and abuse. Most evidence shows that the benefits of alprazolam in treating panic disorder last only 4 to 10 weeks. However, people with panic disorder have been treated on an open basis for up to 8 months without apparent loss of benefit.|$|E

25|$|The World Federation of Biological Psychiatry {{recommends}} pregabalin as one {{of several}} first line agents {{for the treatment of}} generalized anxiety disorder, but recommends other agents such as SSRIs as <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>treatment</b> for obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. It appears to have anxiolytic effects similar to benzodiazepines with less risk of dependence.|$|E
25|$|The Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) {{recommends}} olanzapine as a <b>first</b> <b>line</b> maintenance <b>treatment</b> in {{bipolar disorder}} {{and the combination}} of olanzapine with fluoxetine as second <b>line</b> <b>treatment</b> for bipolar depression.|$|R
5000|$|Because mood {{disorders}} {{can interfere}} with the vestibular compensation and adaptive plasticity, it suggested to address any co-occurring anxiety disorder and/or depression. Severe anxiety episodes are usually addressed by short-term benzodiazapine therapy. Long-term use of benzodiazapines such as diazapam, however, is not recommended due to the tolerance issues. SSRIs and SSNRIs are {{among a number of}} <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>treatments</b> for anxiety or depression.|$|R

25|$|Amoxicillin, also spelled amoxycillin, is an {{antibiotic}} {{useful for the}} treatment of a number of bacterial infections. It is the <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>treatment</b> for middle ear infections. It may also be used for strep throat, pneumonia, skin infections, and urinary tract infections among others. It is taken by mouth, or less commonly by injection.|$|E
25|$|Neither rate nor rhythm {{control is}} {{superior}} {{in people with}} heart failure when they are compared in various clinical trials. However, rate control is recommended as the <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>treatment</b> regimen for heart failure patients. On the other hand, rhythm control is only recommended when patients experience persistent symptoms despite adequate rate control therapy.|$|E
25|$|For {{people with}} {{extended}} periods of cluster headaches, preventive therapy can be necessary. Verapamil is recommended as <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>treatment.</b> Lithium can also be useful. For people with shorter bouts, a short course of prednisone (10 days) can be helpful. Ergotamine is useful if given 1–2 hours before an attack. See cluster headaches for more detailed information.|$|E
50|$|The <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>treatments</b> are {{diazepam}} and a non-selective beta blocker; other antihypertensive drugs {{may also}} be used. It {{is important to note}} that not all benzodiazepines and beta blockers are safe to use in an adrenergic storm; for instance, alprazolam and propranolol; alprazolam weakly agonizes dopamine receptors and causes catecholamine release while propranolol mildly promotes some catecholamine release - each worsening the condition.|$|R
5000|$|Antidepressants - {{there is}} {{evidence}} to support the use of SSRI and SNRI antidepressants in bipolar II. Indeed, some sources consider them {{to be one of the}} <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>treatments.</b> [...] However, antidepressants also pose significant risks, including a switch to mania, rapid cycling, and dysphoria [...] and so many psychiatrists advise against their use for bipolar. When used, antidepressants are typically combined with a mood stabilizer.|$|R

25|$|The pain {{medication}} acetaminophen is the <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>treatment</b> for osteoarthritis. However, a 2015 review found acetaminophen to {{only have a}} small short-term benefit. For mild to moderate symptoms effectiveness is similar to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), though for more severe symptoms NSAIDs may be more effective. NSAIDs such as naproxen, while more effective in severe cases, are associated with greater side effects, such as gastrointestinal bleeding. Diclofenac {{may be the most}} effective NSAID.|$|E
25|$|Broad-spectrum benzimidazoles (such as {{albendazole}} and mebendazole) are the <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>treatment</b> of intestinal roundworm and tapeworm infections. Macrocyclic lactones (such as ivermectin) {{are effective}} against adult and migrating larval stages of nematodes. Praziquantel is the {{drug of choice}} for schistosomiasis, taeniasis, and most types of food-borne trematodiases. Oxamniquine is also widely used in mass deworming programmes. Pyrantel is commonly used for veterinary nematodiasis. Artemisinins and derivatives are proving to be candidates as drugs of choice for trematodiasis.|$|E
25|$|Vasodilators – {{calcium channel}} blockers, {{such as the}} dihydropyridines {{nifedipine}} or amlodipine, preferably slow release preparations – are often <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>treatment.</b> They have the common side effects of headache, flushing, and ankle edema; {{but these are not}} typically of sufficient severity to require cessation of treatment. The limited evidence available shows that calcium channel blockers are only slightly effective in reducing how often the attacks happen. Peoples whose RP is secondary to erythromelalgia often cannot use vasodilators for therapy as they trigger 'flares' causing the extremities to become burning red due to there being too much blood.|$|E
50|$|Statins {{remain the}} <b>first</b> <b>line</b> for <b>treatment</b> of blood cholesterol. AHA {{guidelines}} from 2013 {{did not find}} evidence for routine use of additional medications.|$|R
2500|$|Appropriate {{medications}} {{are effective}} for panic disorder. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>treatments</b> rather than benzodiazapines due to concerns {{with the latter}} regarding tolerance, dependence and abuse. Although {{there is little evidence}} that pharmacological interventions can directly alter phobias, few studies have been performed, and medication treatment of panic makes phobia treatment far easier (an example in Europe where only 8% of patients receive appropriate treatment). Medications can include: ...|$|R

25|$|Key {{infectious}} diseases products include Incivio (telaprevir), a hepatitis C protease inhibitor; Intelence (Etravirine), a non-nucleoside HIV polymerase inhibitor; and Prezista (darunavir), an HIV protease inhibitor. Telaprevir sales {{are expected to}} decline due to the recent approval of treatment regimens that are more efficacious and much better tolerated. Etravirine and darunavir are notable for their high barriers to resistance development. Darunavir in combination with HIV polymerase inhibitors is recommended as a <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>treatment</b> option for treatment naive persons with HIV infection but etravirine is approved only for use in treatment-experienced patients, owing in part to its requirement for twice-daily dosing.|$|E
25|$|Metformin is {{generally}} recommended as a <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>treatment</b> for type2 diabetes, {{as there is}} good evidence that it decreases mortality. It works by decreasing the liver's production of glucose. Several other groups of drugs, mostly given by mouth, may also decrease blood sugar in type II DM. These include agents that increase insulin release, agents that decrease absorption of sugar from the intestines, and agents that make the body more sensitive to insulin. When insulin is used in type2 diabetes, a long-acting formulation is usually added initially, while continuing oral medications. Doses of insulin are then increased to effect.|$|E
25|$|Duloxetine was {{approved}} {{for the treatment}} of major depression in 2004. While duloxetine has demonstrated improvement in depression-related symptoms compared to placebo, comparisons of duloxetine to other antidepressant medications have been less successful. A 2012 Cochrane Review did not find greater efficacy of duloxetine compared to SSRIs and newer antidepressants. Additionally, the review found evidence that duloxetine has increased side effects and reduced tolerability compared to other antidepressants. It thus did not recommend duloxetine as a <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>treatment</b> for major depressive disorder, given the (then) high cost of duloxetine compared to inexpensive off-patent antidepressants and lack of increased efficacy. Generic duloxetine became available in 2013.|$|E
50|$|Pharmaceutical {{treatments}} for GAD include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These are the preferred <b>first</b> <b>line</b> of <b>treatment.</b> SSRIs {{used for this}} purpose include escitalopram and paroxetine.|$|R

25|$|Statins {{may be less}} {{effective}} in reducing LDL cholesterol in people with familial hypercholesterolemia, especially those with homozygous deficiencies. These people have defects usually in either the LDL receptor or apolipoprotein B genes, {{both of which are}} responsible for LDL clearance from the blood. Statins are still <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>treatments</b> in familial hypercholesterolemia, although other cholesterol-reducing measures may be required. In people with homozygous deficiencies, statins may still prove helpful, albeit at high doses and in combination with other cholesterol-reducing medications.|$|R
