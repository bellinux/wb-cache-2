5|$|Curium has {{peculiar}} magnetic properties. Whereas {{its neighbor}} element americium shows no deviation from Curie-Weiss paramagnetism {{in the entire}} temperature range, α-Cm transforms to an antiferromagnetic state upon cooling to 65–52 K, and β-Cm exhibits a ferrimagnetic transition at about 205 K. Meanwhile, curium pnictides show <b>ferromagnetic</b> transitions upon cooling: 244CmN and 244CmAs at 109 K, 248CmP at 73 K and 248CmSb at 162 K. The lanthanide analogue of curium, gadolinium, {{as well as its}} pnictides, also show magnetic transitions upon cooling, but the transition character is somewhat different: Gd and GdN become <b>ferromagnetic,</b> and GdP, GdAs and GdSb show antiferromagnetic ordering.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} with the other rare-earth metals, which usually have antiferromagnetic and/or <b>ferromagnetic</b> properties at low temperatures, ytterbium is paramagnetic at temperatures above 1.0 kelvin. However, the alpha allotrope is diamagnetic. With a melting point of 824°C and a boiling point of 1196°C, ytterbium has the smallest liquid range of all the metals.|$|E
5|$|In <b>ferromagnetic</b> {{elements}} such as iron, cobalt and nickel, an odd number of electrons leads to an unpaired electron and a net overall magnetic moment. The orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and a lower energy state is achieved when the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned with each other, a spontaneous process known as an exchange interaction. When the magnetic moments of <b>ferromagnetic</b> atoms are lined up, the material can produce a measurable macroscopic field. Paramagnetic materials have atoms with magnetic moments that line up in random directions when no magnetic field is present, but the magnetic moments of the individual atoms line up {{in the presence of}} a field.|$|E
5|$|Praseodymium, {{like all}} of the {{lanthanides}} (except lanthanum, ytterbium, and lutetium, which have no unpaired 4f electrons), is paramagnetic at room temperature. Unlike some other rare-earth metals, which show antiferromagnetic or <b>ferromagnetic</b> ordering at low temperatures, praseodymium is paramagnetic at all temperatures above 1K.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium is {{paramagnetic}} and no magnetic transitions {{are known}} for it at any temperature. It becomes superconductive at temperatures below 1.4 K. Protactinium tetrachloride is paramagnetic at room temperature but turns <b>ferromagnetic</b> upon cooling to 182 K.|$|E
5|$|Pure thulium metal has a bright, silvery luster, which tarnishes on {{exposure}} to air. The metal {{can be cut}} with a knife, as it has a Mohs hardness of 2 to 3; it is malleable and ductile. Thulium is <b>ferromagnetic</b> below 32K, antiferromagnetic between 32 and 56K, and paramagnetic above 56K.|$|E
5|$|ZnO {{has also}} been {{considered}} for spintronics applications: if doped with 1–10% of magnetic ions (Mn, Fe, Co, V, etc.), ZnO could become <b>ferromagnetic,</b> even at room temperature. Such room temperature ferromagnetism in ZnO:Mn has been observed, {{but it is not}} clear yet whether it originates from the matrix itself or from secondary oxide phases.|$|E
5|$|Magnetism as a {{property}} of matter {{has been known}} in China since 4000 BC. However, the first modern studies of magnetism only started {{with the development of}} electrodynamics by Faraday, Maxwell and others in the nineteenth century, which included classifying materials as <b>ferromagnetic,</b> paramagnetic and diamagnetic based on their response to magnetization. Pierre Curie studied the dependence of magnetization on temperature and discovered the Curie point phase transition in <b>ferromagnetic</b> materials. In 1906, Pierre Weiss introduced the concept of magnetic domains to explain the main properties of ferromagnets. The first attempt at a microscopic description of magnetism was by Wilhelm Lenz and Ernst Ising through the Ising model that described magnetic materials as consisting of a periodic lattice of spins that collectively acquired magnetization. The Ising model was solved exactly to show that spontaneous magnetization cannot occur in one dimension but is possible in higher-dimensional lattices. Further research such as by Bloch on spin waves and Néel on antiferromagnetism led to developing new magnetic materials with applications to magnetic storage devices.|$|E
5|$|The most {{familiar}} condensed phases are solids and liquids while more exotic condensed phases include the superconducting phase exhibited by certain materials at low temperature, the <b>ferromagnetic</b> and antiferromagnetic phases of spins on crystal lattices of atoms, and the Bose–Einstein condensate found in ultracold atomic systems. The study of {{condensed matter physics}} involves measuring various material properties via experimental probes along with using methods of theoretical physics to develop mathematical models that help in understanding physical behavior.|$|E
5|$|Uncommon {{magnetic}} properties (spin glass state) {{were observed in}} diamond nanocrystals intercalated with potassium. Unlike paramagnetic host material, magnetic susceptibility measurements of intercalated nanodiamond revealed distinct <b>ferromagnetic</b> behavior at 5 K. This is essentially different from results of potassium intercalation in graphite or C60 fullerene, and shows that sp3 bonding promotes magnetic ordering in carbon. The measurements presented first experimental evidence of intercalation-induced spin-glass state in a nanocrystalline diamond system.|$|E
25|$|Note that, {{since the}} {{permeability}} of <b>ferromagnetic</b> materials changes with applied magnetic flux, the inductance of a coil with a <b>ferromagnetic</b> core will generally vary with current.|$|E
25|$|Diborides, LnB2, {{have been}} {{reported}} for Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb and Lu. All have the same, AlB2, structure containing a graphitic layer of boron atoms. Low temperature <b>ferromagnetic</b> transitions for Tb, Dy, Ho and Er. TmB2 is <b>ferromagnetic</b> at 7.2 K.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exceptions}} of La, Yb, and Lu (which have no unpaired f electrons), the lanthanides are strongly paramagnetic, {{and this is}} reflected in their magnetic susceptibilities. Gadolinium becomes <b>ferromagnetic</b> at below 16°C (Curie point). The other heavier lanthanides – terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, and ytterbium – become <b>ferromagnetic</b> at much lower temperatures.|$|E
25|$|The most studied {{case of the}} Ising {{model is}} the translation-invariant <b>ferromagnetic</b> zero-field model on a d-dimensional lattice, namely, Λnbsp&=nbsp&Zd, J'ijnbsp&=nbsp&1, hnbsp&=nbsp&0.|$|E
25|$|Here the {{brackets}} {{mean the}} above-mentioned thermal average. Schematic plots of this function are shown for a <b>ferromagnetic</b> material below, at, and above its Curie temperature on the left.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that all}} {{materials}} undergo this orbital response. However, in paramagnetic and <b>ferromagnetic</b> substances, the diamagnetic effect is {{overwhelmed by the}} much stronger effects caused by the unpaired electrons.|$|E
25|$|Ferroelectric {{crystals}} often show several transition {{temperatures and}} domain structure hysteresis, much as do <b>ferromagnetic</b> crystals. The {{nature of the}} phase transition in some ferroelectric crystals is still not well understood.|$|E
25|$|In a <b>ferromagnetic</b> Ising model, spins {{desire to}} be aligned: the {{configurations}} in which adjacent spins are of the same sign have higher probability. In an antiferromagnetic model, adjacent spins tend to have opposite signs.|$|E
25|$|The lack {{of harmful}} {{effects on the}} patient and the {{operator}} make MRI well-suited for interventional radiology, where the images produced by an MRI scanner guide minimally invasive procedures. Such procedures must be done with no <b>ferromagnetic</b> instruments.|$|E
25|$|Tc is the Curie {{temperature}}. The Curie-Weiss {{law will}} apply {{only when the}} temperature is well above the Curie temperature. At temperatures below the Curie temperature the substance may become <b>ferromagnetic.</b> More complicated behaviour is observed with the heavier transition elements.|$|E
25|$|Hematite is an antiferromagnetic {{material}} below the Morin transition at 250kelvin (K) or -9.7degrees Fahrenheit (°F), and a canted antiferromagnet or weakly <b>ferromagnetic</b> above the Morin transition and below its Néel temperature at 948 K, above {{which it is}} paramagnetic.|$|E
25|$|It {{was known}} in 2006 that the {{deliberate}} structural distortion of a Mn6 compound {{by the use of}} a bulky salicylaldoxime derivative switches the intra-triangular magnetic exchange from antiferromagnetic to <b>ferromagnetic,</b> resulting in an S = 12 ground state.|$|E
25|$|More generally, (<b>ferromagnetic)</b> {{semiconductors}} return both electro-gyration and a Faraday {{response in}} the high frequency domain. The {{combination of the two}} is described by gyroelectromagnetic media, for which gyroelectricity and gyromagnetism (Faraday effect) may occur at the same time.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the {{relative}} intensities {{of the various}} peaks reflect {{the relative}} concentrations of compounds in a sample {{and can be used}} for semi-quantitative analysis. Also, since <b>ferromagnetic</b> phenomena are size-dependent, in some cases spectra can provide insight into the crystallite size and grain structure of a material.|$|E
25|$|Less {{familiar}} phases include plasmas, Bose–Einstein condensates and fermionic condensates and the paramagnetic and <b>ferromagnetic</b> {{phases of}} magnetic materials. While most familiar phases deal with three-dimensional systems, {{it is also}} possible to define analogs in two-dimensional systems, which has received attention for its relevance to systems in biology.|$|E
25|$|A magnetically {{shielded}} room (MSR) model {{consists of three}} nested main layers. Each of these layers is made of a pure aluminium layer, plus a high-permeability <b>ferromagnetic</b> layer, similar in composition to molybdenum permalloy. The <b>ferromagnetic</b> layer is supplied as 1mm sheets, while the innermost layer is composed of four sheets in close contact, and the outer two layers are composed of three sheets each. Magnetic continuity is maintained by overlay strips. Insulating washers {{are used in the}} screw assemblies to ensure that each main layer is electrically isolated. This helps eliminate radio frequency radiation, which would degrade SQUID performance. Electrical continuity of the aluminium is also maintained by aluminium overlay strips to ensure AC eddy current shielding, which is important at frequencies greater than 1Hz. The junctions of the inner layer are often electroplated with silver or gold to improve conductivity of the aluminium layers.|$|E
25|$|This {{material}} has metallic appearance {{and is an}} electrical conductor. Its resistivity is {{higher than that of}} iron, and decreases down to a minimum at 8 GPa. Above 13 GPa the resistivity increases with pressure. The material is <b>ferromagnetic</b> at the lowest pressure range, but the ferromagnetism begins to decrease at 20 GPa and disappears at 32 GPa t.|$|E
25|$|Some {{materials}} show induced magnetic {{behavior that}} follows a Curie type law but with exceptionally large {{values for the}} Curie constants. These materials are known as superparamagnets. They are characterized by a strong <b>ferromagnetic</b> or ferrimagnetic type of coupling into domains of a limited size that behave independently from one another. The bulk properties of such a system resembles that of a paramagnet, but on a microscopic level they are ordered. The materials do show an ordering temperature above which the behavior reverts to ordinary paramagnetism (with interaction). Ferrofluids are a good example, but the phenomenon can also occur inside solids, e.g., when dilute paramagnetic centers are introduced in a strong itinerant medium of <b>ferromagnetic</b> coupling such as when Fe is substituted in TlCu2Se2 or the alloy AuFe. Such systems contain ferromagnetically coupled clusters that freeze out at lower temperatures. They are also called mictomagnets.|$|E
25|$|Compositions with x > 0.7 do {{not exist}} at {{ordinary}} pressures (see dicalcium aluminate). The crystal is orthorhombic, and is normally lath-like. Its density varies from 4026kg⋅m−3 (x = 0) to 3614kg⋅m−3 (x = 0.7). All compositions melt incongruently in the range 1400−1450°C. They are <b>ferromagnetic,</b> progressively more so as iron content increases. These phases are easily prepared from the oxides.|$|E
25|$|The last-mentioned {{tendency}} dominates in the metals iron, cobalt and nickel, {{and in some}} rare earths, {{which are}} <b>ferromagnetic.</b> Most of the other metals, where the first-mentioned tendency dominates, are nonmagnetic (e.g. sodium, aluminium, and magnesium) or antiferromagnetic (e.g. manganese). Diatomic gases are also almost exclusively diamagnetic, and not paramagnetic. However, the oxygen molecule, because of the involvement of π-orbitals, is an exception important for the life-sciences.|$|E
25|$|A modern HDD records data by {{magnetizing}} a {{thin film}} of <b>ferromagnetic</b> material on a disk. Sequential changes {{in the direction of}} magnetization represent binary data bits. The data is read from the disk by detecting the transitions in magnetization. User data is encoded using an encoding scheme, such as run-length limited encoding, which determines how the data is represented by the magnetic transitions.|$|E
25|$|If {{there is}} {{sufficient}} energy exchange between neighbouring dipoles they will interact, and may spontaneously align or anti-align and form magnetic domains, resulting in ferromagnetism (permanent magnets) or antiferromagnetism, respectively. Paramagnetic behavior can also be observed in <b>ferromagnetic</b> materials that are above their Curie temperature, and in antiferromagnets above their Néel temperature. At these temperatures, the available thermal energy simply overcomes the interaction energy between the spins.|$|E
25|$|A {{magnetic}} field contains energy, and physical systems move toward configurations with lower energy. When diamagnetic material {{is placed in}} a {{magnetic field}}, a magnetic dipole tends to align itself in opposed polarity to that field, thereby lowering the net field strength. When <b>ferromagnetic</b> material is placed within a magnetic field, the magnetic dipoles align to the applied field, thus expanding the domain walls of the magnetic domains.|$|E
25|$|The {{magnetic}} {{moments of}} atoms in a <b>ferromagnetic</b> material {{cause them to}} behave something like tiny permanent magnets. They stick together and align themselves into small regions of more or less uniform alignment called magnetic domains or Weiss domains. Magnetic domains can be observed with a magnetic force microscope to reveal magnetic domain boundaries that resemble white lines in the sketch. There are many scientific experiments that can physically show magnetic fields.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance is extremely useful for analyzing samples non-destructively. Radio waves and static magnetic fields easily penetrate {{many types of}} matter and anything that is not inherently <b>ferromagnetic.</b> For example, various expensive biological samples, such as nucleic acids, including RNA and DNA, or proteins, can be studied using nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} for weeks or months before using destructive biochemical experiments. This also makes nuclear magnetic resonance {{a good choice for}} analyzing dangerous samples.|$|E
25|$|A {{reed switch}} is an {{electrical}} switch {{consisting of two}} <b>ferromagnetic</b> and specially shaped contact blades (reeds) positioned in a hermetically sealed glass tube with a gap between them and in a protective atmosphere. Operated by an applied magnetic field, reed switches are used as reed relays, automotive sensors, robotics sensors, security sensors and are found in many toys and games. The reed switch was invented in 1936 by W. B. Elwood at Bell Telephone Laboratories.|$|E
