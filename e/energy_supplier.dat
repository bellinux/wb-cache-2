5|$|Following deregulation, the {{consumer}} has {{a choice of}} <b>energy</b> <b>supplier.</b> Electricity is provided by CE Electric UK, trading as NEDL. Natural gas was (and still is) supplied by British Gas. Distribution and, as with electricity, transmission, {{is the responsibility of}} the National Grid, having been demerged as Transco in 1997. These industries are regulated by OFGEM.|$|E
5|$|The {{commercial}} <b>energy</b> <b>supplier</b> {{for electricity}} and gas is at the consumer's choice. Southern Electric runs the local electricity distribution network, while SGN runs the gas distribution network. A notable part of the local energy infrastructure {{is the presence of}} a 2 megawatt (peak) Enercon wind turbine at Green Park Business Park, wired to the local sub-grid. It has the potential to produce 3.5million units of electricity a year, enough to power over a thousand homes.|$|E
5|$|The trams are {{electrically}} powered from 750 V DC overhead lines. Between 1992 and 2007, electricity for the Metrolink system was procured by the operator, based on price only. In 2007, GMPTE changed the contractual requirements {{to ensure that}} sustainable power would be factored into choosing an <b>energy</b> <b>supplier,</b> and in July 2007, Metrolink became the first light rail network in the UK with electricity supplied entirely from sustainable energy via hydropower. Now, energy for the system is generated by biomass.|$|E

50|$|The Energy Company Obligation (ECO) {{is aimed}} at helping those in {{vulnerable}} and hard-to-treat homes. ECO will be funded by the big <b>energy</b> <b>suppliers</b> and they look to implement measures worth around £1.3 billion every year. This cost will be passed onto all consumers through their energy bills. Where {{the cost of the}} work outweighs the savings, or people need that financial help, <b>energy</b> <b>suppliers</b> may be able to top-up finance for the works. The ECO takes over from existing obligations such as CERT, CESP and the Warm Front.|$|R

25|$|The country imports most energy supplies, {{especially}} oil {{and natural}} gas and to a large extent depends on Russia as its <b>energy</b> <b>supplier.</b> While 25% of the natural gas in Ukraine comes from internal sources, about 35% comes from Russia and the remaining 40% from Central Asia through transit routes that Russia controls. At the same time, 85% of the Russian gas is delivered to Western Europe through Ukraine.|$|E
25|$|SLIVER Cell (TM) {{photovoltaic}} technology uses {{just one}} {{tenth of the}} costly and limited supply of silicon used in conventional solar panels while matching power, performance, and efficiency. Professor Andrew Blakers, Director of the Australian National University Centre for Sustainable Energy Systems, invented the technology with colleague Dr Klaus Weber and developed it with funding from <b>energy</b> <b>supplier</b> Origin Energy and the Australian Research Council.

40|$|Industrial {{companies}} and their <b>energy</b> <b>suppliers</b> {{have an opportunity to}} work together in new ways for their mutual benefit. Accomplishing this requires that they redefine the interface between them. They must work at the process/energy interface and not at the fence-line. And they must use modern process integration methods to identify the most beneficial process and energy efficiency improvements. The payoff for industry is substantially reduced costs, improved process designs, increased energy efficiencies, and a reduction in emissions. The <b>energy</b> <b>suppliers</b> establish new relationship with their customers, help them to be more competitive and increase their own business. Both parties can win...|$|R
25|$|In January 1995, the {{vertical}} monopolist <b>energy</b> <b>supplier,</b> the State Energy Commission of Western Australia, was dis-aggregated into separate gas and electricity corporations, {{leading to the}} formation of AlintaGas. On 13 July 2000 legislation was passed by the Parliament of Western Australia for the sale of AlintaGas, which listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) on 17 October 2000. On 8 May 2003 AlintaGas Ltd changed its name to Alinta Limited. Alinta acquired infrastructure assets and the Agility business from AGL through a combination of merger and demerger transactions on 25 October 2006.|$|E
25|$|The recent Sino-Angolan {{association}} is illustrative. When a petroleum-rich area called for investment and rebuilding, China advanced a $5 billion loan to be repaid in oil. They sent Chinese technicians, fixing {{a large part}} of the electrical system, and leading a part of the reconstruction. In the short term Angola benefits from Chinese-built roads, hospitals, schools, hotels, football stadiums, shopping centers and telecommunications projects. In turn, Angola mortgaged future oil production of a valuable, non-renewable resource. It may turn out to be a costly trade for Angola, but their needs for infrastructure is immediate and that is precisely what China provideds when no one else is willing to do so. And thusly, Angola has become China's leading <b>energy</b> <b>supplier.</b>|$|E
25|$|On January 18 {{the dispute}} was {{resolved}} when Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Yulia Tymoshenko negotiated {{a new contract}} that covered {{the next ten years}} (on October 11, 2011, a Ukrainian court sentenced Tymoshenko to seven years in prison for abuse of office because she signed this deal). Gas flows to Europe restarted on the morning of January 20, and were fully restored within two days. In the aftermath, Gazprom was estimated to have lost US$1.5billion in revenues due to lack of sales, and Ukraine was speculated to have incurred major economic losses. Analysts point out that the crisis had a negative and possibly irreversible impact on the reputations of both Russia as an <b>energy</b> <b>supplier,</b> and Ukraine as a transit country. There is no consensus amongst analysts on who bore the most responsibility for the crisis. Due to the absence of international monitors {{on both sides of the}} Ukrainian pipeline system, it is impossible to determine with certainty who was responsible for interrupting gas flow to Europe.|$|E
50|$|The Utilities Intermediaries Association (UIA) is a {{trade body}} for UK Third Party Intermediaries (TPIs) in the {{business}} energy sector. Although it is a limited company, it runs as a not-for-profit organisation. TPIs are also known as energy brokers or consultants (Energy switching services in the UK), which facilitate the purchasing of electricity and gas between their clients and <b>energy</b> <b>suppliers.</b> They {{work on behalf of}} businesses, providing procurement services in exchange for commissions from the <b>energy</b> <b>suppliers.</b> This had led some TPIs to compromise their neutrality so they can earn the most commission through bias toward the suppliers that pay the most.|$|R

500|$|On 11 May 2007, {{proposals}} for a £2billion clean coal power station were announced by <b>energy</b> <b>supplier</b> RWE npower. [...] If the plans go ahead, {{it is estimated}} that 1,500 jobs will be created for the construction, with another 200 full-time staff required for the running of the plant, which would open in 2014 {{on the site of the}} old power station. [...] The development would see the installation of three 800megawatt coal-fired units, which would generate enough energy to supply around 3.5million homes. [...] These plans have, however, met some opposition; many residents living in the area feel that the land should be redeveloped for other purposes, rather than continue to be used as an industrial site. [...] The MP for Wansbeck, Denis Murphy, stated that, although the project would have benefits for the area, he still had concerns; Ronnie Campbell, the MP for Blyth Valley, claimed he would welcome the development as long as it did not have an adverse effect on the overall regeneration of the area.|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of alternative energy requires collaboration between consumers, <b>energy</b> <b>suppliers</b> and regulators. A fundamental question is, will consumers engage with this agenda and, in particular, will they trust the institutions sufficiently {{to enable the}} collaborations that are needed. Present indications suggest that consumers have little trust in the established institutions and tend to reject such collaborations. This article presents two case studies which explore the way consumers, regulators and <b>energy</b> <b>suppliers</b> interact in relation to alternative energy projects. It analyses the inter-group interactions {{from the perspective of}} symbolic interactionism and discusses the aspects that undermine trust, leading to suggestions for improved trust.

2500|$|Both Russia and Ukraine {{claimed to}} have emerged triumphant from the dispute, but both {{countries}} sustained major blows to their economies {{in the middle of}} an already serious economic crisis. Gazprom was estimated to have lost about $1.5billion in revenues due to lack of sales, while Ukraine lost an estimated $100million in transit fees and was speculated to have incurred major economic losses due to much of its industry, the backbone of its economy, being temporarily shut down. Analysts pointed out that the crisis and the way it was handled had a negative and possibly irreversible impact on the reputations of both Russia as an <b>energy</b> <b>supplier,</b> and Ukraine as a transit country. According to the Czech foreign minister, [...] "The main lesson learned from this crisis is that Russia and Ukraine aren’t reliable suppliers. Europe must think about alternative sources and pipelines." [...] The President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso similarly expressed during the crisis that by failing to honor supply agreements Russia and Ukraine could no longer be considered reliable energy partners.|$|E
