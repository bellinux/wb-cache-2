The area density of the dimple patterns were varied between 5 % and 25 %, the speed was varied from 0. 06 - 0. 26 m/s, and the load was varied between 20 - 100 N. In general, we found that as the velocity increased, the friction coefficient increased. Furthermore, the friction coefficient was lowest at a load of 40 N. The friction coefficient of the non-coated specimen was 0. 025 - 0. 15; on the other hand, the friction coefficient of the coated specimen was 0. 002 - 0. 02.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} curvature and topology on crystalline <b>dimpled</b> <b>patterns</b> {{on the surface of}} generic elastic bilayers. Our numerical analysis predicts that the total number of defects created by adiabatic compression exhibits universal quadratic scaling for spherical, ellipsoidal, and toroidal surfaces over a wide range of system sizes. However, both the localization of individual defects and the orientation of defect chains depend strongly on the local Gaussian curvature and its gradients across a surface. Our results imply that curvature and topology can be utilized to pattern defects in elastic materials, thus promising improved control over hierarchical bending, buckling, or folding processes. Generally, this study suggests that bilayer systems provide an inexpensive yet valuable experimental test bed for exploring the effects of geometrically induced forces on assemblies of topological charges.

In order to study weld cracking, each relation as follows has been investigated; the relation between the water content of the flux and the diffusible hydrogen in deposited metal based on JIS hydrogen test method, the relation between the applied stress and the occurrence of weld cracking varied dry conditions of the electrode by using Impant Test, and the relation between the diffusible hydrogen and the fracture by using scanning electron microscope. The results are summarized as follows; (1) In ilmenite type electrode (D 4301) as the water content of the flux is increasing, the diffusible hydrogen in deposited metal is also increasing straightly. Using the dried electrode, a lot of the diffusible hydrogen are included in deposited metal. (2) In low hydrogen type electrode (D 5016 and E 11016) as the water content of the flux is increasing until 2 %, the diffusible hydrogen in deposited metal is rapidly increasing. (3) The electrode that the moisture absorbability is high is E 11016. (4) In high strength steel, the stress range that occurrs in weld cracking becomes wide by using wetted electrode. (5) In the case of using dried electrode (D 4301) and wetted electrode (E 11016) the relation between the applied stress and the fracture time are almost the same results.

The DC-FFT algorithm, a novel numerical method to calculate the stress components of any element in the contact area was used to predict the maximum tangential load the contact can withstand before sliding. The calculated tangential load and external normal load were used to estimate the static friction coefficient at the contact interface. The model was experimentally validated using data obtained with a specially designed test rig.

40|$|Wrinkles {{represent}} a pathway towards the spontaneous generation of ordered surface microstructure for applications in numerous fields. Examples of highly complex ordered wrinkle structures abound in Nature, but {{the ability to}} harness this potential for advanced material applications remains limited. This work focuses on understanding {{the relationship between the}} patterns on a wrinkled surface and the experimental conditions under which they form. Because wrinkles form in response to applied stresses, particular attention is given {{to the nature of the}} stresses in a wrinkling surface. The fundamental insight gained was then utilized to account for observed wrinkle formation phenomena within more complex geometric and kinetic settings. In order to carefully control and measure the applied stresses on a wrinkling film, a swelling-based system was developed using poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), surface-oxidized with a UV-ozone treatment. The swelling of the oxidized surface upon exposure to an ethanol vapor atmosphere was characterized using beam-bending experiments, allowing quantitative measurements of the applied stress. The wrinkle morphologies were characterized as a function of the overstress, defined as the ratio of the applied swelling stress to the critical buckling stress of the material. A transition in the dominant morphology of the wrinkled surfaces from <b>dimple</b> <b>patterns</b> to ridge patterns was observed at an overstress value of ∼ 2. The pattern dependence of wrinkles on the ratio of the principal stresses was examined by fabricating samples with a gradient prestress.

40|$|AbstractAerodynamic forces act on a {{golf ball}} during flight. For that purpose {{in order to develop}} a golf ball with high performance, it is {{important}} to analyze aerodynamic characteristics of the golf ball. On the other hand, <b>dimple</b> <b>pattern</b> of a golf ball is complicate and the influence of dimples hasn’t been investigated in detail. Therefore the influence of golf ball dimples on aerodynamic characteristics was investigated using a wind tunnel and rotating device. Some golf balls whose dimples have different depths were measured. As a result, {{it was found that the}} shallower the dimple was, the larger the lift coefficient was. However, when the depth of the dimples was much shallower, the lift coefficient was extremely-little on the slow velocity, i. e. under 30 m/s. When the golf ball trajectory which was launched with a driver was calculated under various initial conditions, the ball velocity became under 30 m/s over the vertex of the trajectory in many cases, including professional male golfers and female golfers. Therefore, if the lift coefficient of the velocity of 30 m/s becomes smaller, distances will become shorter. Dimple patterns that had a high lift coefficient at all velocities was researched. As a result, it was found that a golf ball with a <b>dimple</b> <b>pattern</b> that has extremely small dimples between large shallow dimples has a high lift coefficient at all velocities, including under 30 m/s. In order to investigate the cause of the results, a flow visualization experiment was conducted. Visualization of flow around a golf ball was conducted by generating smoke.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of an {{experimental}} investigation on the crystallography of the <b>dimpled</b> <b>patterns</b> obtained through wrinkling of a curved elastic system. Our macroscopic samples comprise a thin hemispherical shell bound to an equally curved compliant substrate. Under compression, a crystalline <b>pattern</b> of <b>dimples</b> self-organizes {{on the surface of the}} shell. Stresses are relaxed by both out-of-surface buckling and the emergence of defects in the quasi-hexagonal pattern. Three-dimensional scanning is used to digitize the topography. Regarding the dimples as point-like packing units produces spherical Voronoi tessellations with cells that are polydisperse and distorted, away from their regular shapes. We analyze the structure of crystalline defects, as a function of system size. Disclinations are observed and, above a threshold value, dislocations proliferate rapidly with system size. Our samples exhibit striking similarities with other curved crystals of charged particles and colloids. Differences are also found and attributed to the far-from-equilibrium nature of our patterns due to the random and initially frozen material imperfections which act as nucleation points, the presence of a physical boundary which represents an additional source of stress, and the inability of dimples to rearrange during crystallization. Even if we do not have access to the exact form of the interdimple interaction, our experiments suggest a broader generality of previous results of curved crystallography and their robustness on the details of the interaction potential. Furthermore, our findings open the door to future studies on curved crystals far from equilibrium. Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Charles E.

40|$|Applying dimples on spherical bluff {{bodies have}} been found to be a major {{technique}} to control the surface flow and reduce the stream-wise force. However, not much work has been done on dimple applications on cylindrical Objects. This research project aims to investigate, firstly, whether the stream-wise force on a circular cylinder could be reduced by using dimples on its outer surface. Secondly, if it could, whether there is an optimum design that gives the biggest force reduction. Thirdly, what the roles of different approaches in this project might be? In order to find answers to these questions, experimental and computational methods have been used. One smooth and three dimpled cylinders have been tested. It was found that applying dimples on the outer surface of a cylinder is very effective in reducing stream-wise force. Drag coefficient significantly reduced by 17 % to 48 % depending on different Reynolds numbers. However, the dimpled design did not seem to be the key factor of the reduction, and the level of drag reduction was found to be insensitive to different <b>dimpled</b> <b>patterns.</b> Furthermore, it has also been found that CFD method would not be suitable as the research tool for this project because of its demanding requirement in computer power. Therefore, rig tests remained the primary method for this project. In addition, flow visualization technique was also used to show the wake region behind both the smooth and dimpled cylinders.

Stainless steel wire of 0. 8 mm diameter and nickel chromium crwon for lower second molar of temporary teeth were used. A loop 1 cm wide, made of 3. 5 cm stainless steel wire, was welded with 3 dots on the crown using an electric spot welder. Each dot for each group took different spot variations from 1 X – 4 X. A loop space maintainer made with the usual materials and techniques as applied at the IKGA FKG UI Clinic was used as a control, with a torch as heat source. Ten specimens each were prepared for shear testing and three spesimens each for metallography. Universal testing machine was used for shear strength testing at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min, and SEM/EDS was used for metallography and fractography. The data were statistically analyzed with one-way ANOVA at p = 0. 05, and Tukey post hoc test. The results show that the shear strength of the welded loop space maintainer was higher than that of a soldered loop space maintainer, although the difference was not statistically significant with spot variation 1 X. SEM/EDS analysis suggests that a new alloy forms at the contact area of welded and soldered loop space maintainer.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to perform a failure {{analysis}} on fractured prosthetic retaining screws after long-term use in vivo. Additionally, the study addresses the commonly asked question regarding whether complex repeated functional occlusal forces initiate fatigue-type cracks in prosthetic retaining screws. Materials and Methods: Ten fractured prosthetic retaining screws retrieved from three patients treated with fixed detachable hybrid prostheses were subjected to a failure analysis. In patients 1 and 2, the middle three retaining screws of the prostheses were found fractured at retrieval time after they had been in service for 20 and 19 months, respectively. In patient 3, the middle three and one of the posterior retaining screws were found to be fractured at retrieval after they had been in service for 18 months. Low power stereomicroscopy and high-power scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were performed to analyze the fractured surfaces of the retaining screws examining fatigue cracks in greater detail. Results: Typical fatigue failure characterized by ratchet mark formation was revealed by light microscopy and SEM for all examined screws. Using low magnification light microscopy, ratchet marks were visible on the fracture surfaces of only two screws. SEM examination revealed all three classical stages of fatigue failure, and it was possible to see the ratchet marks on the fracture surfaces of all specimens, indicating a fatigue zone. The final catastrophic overload fracture appeared fibrous, indicating ductile fracture. The final overload ductile fracture surfaces showed equiaxed dimples, suggesting tensile overload in all examined screws except in two specimens that showed an elongated <b>dimple</b> <b>pattern</b> indicating shear/tearing overload forces. Conclusions: Fracture of prosthetic retaining screws in hybrid prostheses occurs mainly through a typical fatigue mode involving mostly the middle anterior three screws. Fatigue cracks can grow in more than one prosthetic retaining screw, leading to fracture before the patient or clinician determines that any problem exists. King Saud Universit...|$|E
40|$|Objectives This study {{aimed to}} {{describe}} the ultrasonographic, endoscopic and histological characteristics of the caecum and ileocaecocolic junction in cats suffering from chronic clinical signs compatible with caecocolic disease. Methods Cats presenting with clinical signs suggestive of a caecocolic disease were prospectively recruited. All cats underwent an ultrasonographic examination of the caecum, ileum, colon, ileocolic lymph nodes and local mesenteric fat, in addition to comprehensive abdominal ultrasonography. This {{was followed by a}} colonoscopy with a macroscopic assessment of the caecocolic mucosa; caecocolic tissue samples were systematically collected for histologic analysis. Results Eighteen cats were included. Eleven of 18 cats had ultrasonographic abnormalities adjacent to the ileocaecocolic junction (lymphadenopathy, local steatitis) and 13 / 18 cats had abnormalities directly related to the junction (wall thickening, loss of wall layering). Seventeen of 18 cats had at least one ultrasonographic abnormality. Endoscopically, hyperaemia, oedema, discoloration and/or erosions were found in all cats. Each cat was classified as having mild or moderate-to-severe lesions according to endoscopic results; no classification could be established statistically for ultrasonographic results. The accentuation of the <b>dimpled</b> <b>pattern</b> tended to be inversely related to the severity of endoscopic lesion scoring. Histologically, a large proportion of cats showed typhlitis (13 / 16), one had lymphoma and two were normal. All cats with typhlitis also had colitis. There was only slight agreement between endoscopic and histological caecal results regarding the severity of lesions. Loss of caecal wall layering on ultrasound was found in 7 / 18 cats and, surprisingly, did not appear as a reliable predictor of the severity of inflammation or of malignancy; neither did local steatitis nor lymph node size. Conclusions and relevance Ultrasonography and endoscopy should not be used as the sole methods to investigate the ileocaecocolic region in cats with clinical signs suggestive of caecocolic disease. The presence of chronic clinical signs should routinely prompt histological biopsy...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the aims}} of this {{research}} was to reduce the flow separation and therefore the pressure drag generated by a wing section, through the adding of surface modifications. The modifications consisted of roughening the surface of polystyrene airfoils using a sand blasting technique, which resulted in a dimpled surface. This idea originated from the design of a golf ball, as the dimples are known to delay flow separation which allows the ball to travel further. In relation to wing design, there has been very little research available that either proved or dismissed the theory of using a roughened airfoil surface to reduce the pressure drag created by flow separation. Therefore three types of airfoils were tested, the NACA 0006, 0024 and 4424 profiles. Different levels of surface roughness, created by the dimples, were applied to various portions and sides of the airfoils. These were in turn tested on the three airfoil types, including a series of tests with a split flap configuration and the use of end-plates to reduce the induced drag component. The wind tunnel testing was conducted up to a flow velocity of 23 m/s, which led to a maximum Re of 321, 227 and 588, 141 for the single and split flap airfoil testing respectively. The overall research was split into two phases, where in each phase a force measurement system was designed in conjunction with a series of experimental tests. Therefore, during Phase 2 of the research, a new external strain gauge balance (System 2) was developed specifically for the DCU wind tunnel and with the nature of the testing in mind. This followed on from the previous design (System 1) which had certain measurement errors and design inadequacies. Aside from the improved mechanical design of System 2, strain gauge amplifier circuits and a data acquisition system were also developed. The resulting set-up was very sensitive and stable, which was necessary for the low drag and lift forces involved, with a sensitivity of 0. 71 N/V corresponding to a minimum load response of approximately 0. 0007 N, with respect to the slightly more sensitive drag measurement. Therefore, the design of the force measurement system was the main aim of this research. As a result, it was necessary to validate the design with extensive experimental testing, which formed the secondary aim of the research. The resulting <b>dimples</b> <b>patterns</b> tested promoted less flow separation in particular tests, however these dimples were also found to {{have a negative effect on}} lift generation. An important finding also was that in some of the tests the <b>dimple</b> <b>patterns</b> created an increase in the lift force. In addition, large aerodynamic instabilities were observed in tests where dimples were applied to the frontal sections (< 0. 33 c point) of the airfoils, on their low pressure side. By adding a high level of surface roughness (high Ra) via the dimples, to the middle and last 1 / 3 rd sections on the low pressure (flow separation) side of a NACA 0024 airfoil, from 10 ° angle of attack onwards the drag force generated compared to the baseline (unmodified smooth airfoil) decreased. However, the lift force also decreased from approximately 8 ° onwards and at 20 ° there was a drag decrease of 11. 15 % and a lift decrease of 8. 46 %. This therefore led to an overall marginal increase in the aerodynamic efficiency of 3. 13 %. Overall, the effects varied depending on the airfoil test configuration, the surface modification and the angle of attack. A smoke flow visualisation system was also developed and photographs were captured to provide a further analysis of some of the experimental resu...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The microstructures and {{mechanical}} properties of AZ 91 D magnesium alloy produced by two kind of fluxes {{were analyzed by}} using mechanical performance testing machine, optical microscope, differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffraction(XRD), scanning electron microscope（SEM）and energy dispersive spectrometer(EDS) analysis, etc [...] The {{results show that the}} comprehensive properties of AZ 91 D magnesium alloy produced by the new flux named NF were better than traditional flux named RJ- 2. Phase Mg 17 Al 12 was improved enormously. In addition, not only the nuclear particle A 14 C 3 was formed, but also the grain of the alloy was refined remarkably， and the σb，σs and δ were increased eventually. The tensile fracture surface was made of deeper <b>dimples</b> with rolling <b>patterns,</b> which was relevant to the smaller microstructure...|$|R
2500|$|Another type of heat {{exchanger}} is the plate {{heat exchanger}}. These exchangers {{are composed of}} many thin, slightly separated plates that have very large surface areas and small fluid flow passages for heat transfer. [...] Advances in gasket and brazing technology have made the plate-type heat exchanger increasingly practical. In HVAC applications, large heat exchangers of this type are called plate-and-frame; when used in open loops, these heat exchangers are normally of the gasket type to allow periodic disassembly, cleaning, and inspection. There are many types of permanently bonded plate heat exchangers, such as dip-brazed, vacuum-brazed, and welded plate varieties, and they are often specified for closed-loop applications such as refrigeration. Plate heat exchangers also differ {{in the types of}} plates that are used, and in the configurations of those plates. Some plates may be stamped with [...] "chevron", <b>dimpled,</b> or other <b>patterns,</b> where others may have machined fins and/or grooves.|$|R
40|$|Theoretical and {{experimental}} study of the electrical fracture behavior of the dielectric materials, Soda-Lime Glass and Acrylic Glass (PMMA), was made in this work. The charge-free zone (CFZ) model proposed by Zhang et al. {{for the failure of}} conductive cracks in dielectrics, which was well verified by Wang’s experimental results of depoled piezoelectric ceramics PZT 4 and extended by Liu’s experimental results predicting the failure behavior of conductive cracks in piezoelectric ceramics, was applied as a failure criterion to the dielectric breakdown study of Soda-Lime Glass and PMMA. Experiments can use the failure criterion (CFZ model) to study the failure behavior of electrically conductive cracks (deep notches) in Soda-Lime Glass, but it is not suitable for PMMA from recent test results. According to the CFZ model for dielectric materials, the experiment result should be described by a straight-line function. The critical electric intensity factor under purely electric loading of Soda-Lime Glass was obtained using a straight line function to fit the combined results. The electric energy release rate was also found to be larger than the mechanical energy release rate in Soda-Lime Glass. With the <b>dimple</b> structure <b>patterns</b> appearing on the fracto-picture under combined tests, it proved that Soda-Lime Glass is also mechanically brittle and electrically ductile. However, for Polymer material, PMMA, this kind of failure criterion cannot be used to fit the critical electric intensity factor under purely electric loading. Some ductile properties also appeared on the fracture surface of PMMA under combined tests. It also proved that PMMA is mechanically brittle and electrically ductile...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} Doctoral Thesis was to {{investigate}} the effect of root canal curvature on the failure mechanism of rotary Ni-Ti endodontic instruments of the ProFile system (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) under standardized simulated clinical conditions for a known number of consecutive uses. Three hundred mesial root canals from freshly extracted human mandibular molars were used. Root canals were divided into 3 groups according to the angle and radius of curvature according to Pruett et al. (1997) : straight (group A: angle 0 + 10 o, radius 0 mm), moderately curved (group B: angle 30 ± 10 o, radius 2 ± 1 mm) and severely curved (group C: angle 60 ± 10 o, radius 2 ± 1 mm). All instrumentations were performed in the department of Endodontology (Dental School, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki), by a single operator and root canals were enlarged according to the manufacturer’s protocol up to instrument taper. 06 size # 25 at working length. Prior to the first use and after the completion of each instrumentation instruments were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath and autoclaved. Instruments that concluded instru¬mentation of 20 root canals, fractured or were plastically deformed without fracture, were retrieved and substituted. Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis and post hoc test (Cox- Mantel) for determination of significant differences (a= 0. 05). Selected instruments were investigated by means of computerized X-ray microtomography, in order to detect any internal defects. Fractured instruments were subjected to fractographic analysis under SEM. Finally all instruments used were viewed under the metallographic microscope in order to identify any sign of crack propagation. Investigation of the instruments with computerized X-ray microtomography and investigation under SEM and the metallographic microscope were performed in the Department of Dental Biomaterials, Dental School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. Instruments presented fracture arbitrarily from 1 to 20 uses in moderately and severely curved canals. Regardless of the type of the instrument, fracture and failure were statisti¬cally more frequent in group C. After 10 uses survival probability was 90 % for group A, 80 % for group Β and 60 % for group C. After 20 uses there was a further reduction by 5 %, 20 % and 35 % for groups A, B and C respectively. During the inspection with computerized X-ray microtomography and under the metallographic microscope no cracks were detected in unused instruments, fractured instruments, deformed instruments and those that concluded the instru¬mentation of 20 root canals. SEM fractographic examination revealed the presence of tensile fracture with the predominance of dimples, whereas no cracks were detected. The abruptness of root canal curvature negatively affects the failure rate of rotary Ni-Ti instruments and predisposes to fracture. The results of fracture incidence were corroborated by the results of the microscopic inspection with the absence of cracks and the detection of <b>dimples,</b> characteristic <b>pattern</b> of tensile fracture. Therefore it is safe to conclude that fracture was caused by a single overload of the rotating instrument and was not related to a gradual degra¬dation caused by fatigue. ...|$|R
40|$|This program aims at {{improving}} {{the efficiency of}} advanced natural-gas reciprocating engines (ANGRE) by reducing piston and piston ring assembly friction without major adverse effects on engine performance, such as increased oil consumption and wear. An iterative process of simulation, experimentation and analysis has been followed towards achieving the goal of demonstrating a complete optimized low-friction engine system. In this program, a detailed set of piston and piston-ring dynamic and friction models have been adapted and applied that illustrate the fundamental relationships among mechanical, surface/material and lubricant design parameters and friction losses. Demonstration of low-friction ring-pack designs in the Waukesha VGF 18 GL engine confirmed ring-pack friction reduction of 30 - 40 %, which translates to total engine FEMP (friction mean effective pressure) reduction of 7 - 10 % from the baseline configuration without significantly increasing oil consumption or blow-by flow. The study on surface textures, including roughness characteristics, cross hatch <b>patterns,</b> <b>dimples</b> and grooves have shown that even relatively small-scale changes can have a large effect on ring/liner friction, in some cases reducing FMEP {{by as much as}} 30 % from a smooth surface case. The measured FMEP reductions were in good agreement with the model predictions. The combined analysis of lubricant and surface design indicates that low-viscosity lubricants can be very effective in reducing friction, subject to component wear for extremely thin oils, which can be mitigated with further lubricant formulation and/or engineered surfaces. Hence a combined approach of lubricant design and appropriate wear reduction offers improved potential for minimum engine friction loss. Testing of low-friction lubricants showed that total engine FMEP reduced by up to {approx} 16. 5 % from the commercial reference oil without significantly increasing oil consumption or blow-by flow. Piston friction studies indicate that a flatter piston with a more flexible skirt, together with optimizing the waviness and film thickness on the piston skirt offer significant friction reduction. Combined with low-friction ring-pack, material and lubricant parameters, a total power cylinder friction reduction of 30 - 50 % is expected, translating to an engine efficiency increase of two percentage points from its current baseline towards the goal of 50 % ARES engine efficiency. The design strategies developed in this study have promising potential for application in all modern reciprocating engines as they represent simple, low-cost methods to extract significant fuel savings. The current program has possible spinoffs and applications in other industries as well, including transportation, CHP, and diesel power generation. The progress made in this program has wide engine efficiency implications, and potential deployment of low-friction engine components or lubricants in the near term is quite possible...|$|R
