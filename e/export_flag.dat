40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} {{international perspectives}} on trends and {{issues in a}} higher education policy. Privatization and market competition can be mere fads in the higher education policy, but the pursuit of these trends {{from a variety of}} different directions would lead one to believe otherwise. Also, the significance of the lean toward competition, de-regulation, and entrepreneurialism is given some credence {{by the fact that it}} seems that kindred forces are pushing different higher education systems in similar directions. Governments in different places are formulating similar responses to the problems facing their respective higher education systems. This can be due, in part, to similar responses to similar environmental circumstances. Economic instability, rising unemployment, <b>flagging</b> <b>export</b> markets, trade imbalances, and inflation know no national boundaries. Traditional manufacturing industries are being replaced by the so-called “knowledge processing sector,” to which higher education has a particular economic contribution to make. The social service burden on national treasuries is rising everywhere, coupled with “pressures to cut government expenditure and to demand greater efficiencies from public sector institutions and enterprises. ...|$|R
40|$|Iron (Fe) is an {{important}} essential micronutrient and its deficiency is a widespread micronutrient malnutrition problem for human being in the world. Iron biofortification of staple food crop is regarded as {{an effective way to}} solve this problem. Rice is the most important food crop in the world feeding over half of the global population; therefore, a small increase in Fe concentration in rice grain can greatly improve human health. However, the mechanisms of Fe dense accumulation in rice grain are not fully understood, which limits the advance of high Fe-dense rice breeding. In this paper, the characteristics of Fe re-utilization in the dense rice genotype (IR 68144) were studied, as compared with the indense rice genotype (IR 64). The results showed that the ability of iron remobilization from “source” to “sink” was much greater in IR 68144 than in IR 64, i. e. from root, the 1 st, 2 nd, and 3 rd leaf, as well as leaf sheath to the new growing leaves and tillers at vegetative stage, and from root, stem, and flag leaf to grain at reproductive stage. It was estimated that the re-mobilization of Fe in the dense genotype IR 68144 accounted for 28. 5 % of total Fe of the plant at the 4 th leaf stage, which was 1. 6 -fold higher than that of the in-dense genotype IR 64. At the reproductive growth stage, the re-translocation of Fe from leaves and stems to grain was found to be much greater in the dense than in the indense rice genotype, and the re-translocation of Fe depended greatly on Fe pretreatment levels before anthesis and Fe/Zn nutritional status after anthesis. The dense genotype remobilized about 10 -time more Fe from stem with low Fe pretreatment, and exported around 6 -time more Fe from roots and 10 -time more Fe from the flag leaf with adequate Fe pretreatment, as compared to the indense genotype. The remobilization of Fe from the vegetative organs to grain was greater at low Fe supply than at higher Fe supply, and greater re-translocation of Fe was noted in IR 68144 than in IR 64 when pretreated with low Fe. After stopped Fe supply at anthesis, the Fe <b>export</b> from the <b>flag</b> leaf decreased with increasing Fe pretreatment levels in IR 68144, but Fe input in the flag leaf was noted in IR 64. After anthesis, the contribution of remobilized Fe to brown rice Fe accumulation was greater in IR 68144 than in IR 64 with low, adequateand high Fe pretreatments. The results indicate that the Fe-dense rice genotype has greater ability of reutilizing Fe in the source tissues than the indense genotype, and the remobilization ability of Fe from older leaf to the new growing leaves could be used for predicting grain Fe accumulation ability...|$|R
