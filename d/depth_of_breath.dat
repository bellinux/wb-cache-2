30|$|When you meditate {{and bring}} {{conscious}} awareness to your breathing, you are activating the neural pathways associated with conscious control and overriding those that typically cause your breathing pattern (<b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath</b> and rate) to be a completely unconscious process. In general, our bodies 'know' {{how much we}} should breathe {{in order to meet}} the metabolic demands of the moment (need for oxygen and the need to remove the excess carbon dioxide we are producing). An altered breathing pattern (for example, breath of fire in Kundalini yoga) is something that you are imposing on the body. This may account for the difficulty in correctly and effectively engaging in various breathing regimens while meditating. It also explains the fact that you cannot maintain an imposed, voluntary, breathing pattern indefinitely. Over time, you will ultimately revert back to the unconscious and optimal pattern (optimal in terms of metabolism, not necessarily in terms of your meditative goals). As in all things, practice improves the ability to establish and maintain an imposed voluntary breathing pattern but you will always have to engage the thinking and planning portions of the brain located in the cerebral cortex to continue breathing this way.|$|E

In this mode, the frequency and tidal volume <b>of</b> <b>breaths</b> <b>of</b> a patient on the ventilator are automatically adjusted based on the patient’s requirements.

40|$|Abstract. The wave of mergers, {{acquisitions}} and consolidations {{in the financial}} industry since 1994 changed the spatial environment. This paper investigates features of core and peripheral metropolitan areas in Ohio. From a spatial perspective, the Cleveland metropolitan area pos-sesses financial characteristics more closely matched to those of a high-end benchmark finan-cial-core such as Charlotte, North Carolina than to those of medium-size MSAs within the state. Findings suggest that medium-size MSAs {{are unlikely to be}} financial-core areas and that they are not evolving in that direction. Although peripheral areas lack a comparative advantage for developing <b>depth</b> and <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> financial services and are subject to a retailing function from large out-of-market institutions, there was no explicit evidence of funds drainage from me-dium-size peripheral areas because of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act...|$|R
