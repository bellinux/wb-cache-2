5|$|There {{was much}} {{speculation}} {{going into the}} Stakes over Secretariat's bid for the Triple Crown. Since 1948, when Citation achieved the feat, there had been six horses that had won both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes before failing in the Belmont Stakes. When comparing Secretariat to those six horses' health and fitness before the Belmont Stakes, writer Bonifice felt Secretariat was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shape,</b> {{almost as good as}} when he entered the Kentucky Derby weeks prior. Just days before the Belmont, Secretariat ran five furlongs in just under a minute in a morning workout. Following that, Secretariat's jockey Ron Turcotte told reporters that Secretariat was ready for a top charge on Saturday.|$|E
5|$|From 06:00 Wellington was in {{the field}} supervising the {{deployment}} of his forces. At Wavre, the Prussian IV Corps under Bülow was designated to lead the march to Waterloo as it was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shape,</b> not having {{been involved in the}} Battle of Ligny. Although they had not taken casualties, IV Corps had been marching for two days, covering the retreat of the three other corps of the Prussian army from the battlefield of Ligny. They had been posted farthest away from the battlefield, and progress was very slow. The roads were in poor condition after the night's heavy rain, and Bülow's men had to pass through the congested streets of Wavre and move 88artillery pieces. Matters were not helped when a fire broke out in Wavre, blocking several streets along Bülow's intended route. As a result, {{the last part of the}} corps left at 10:00, six hours after the leading elements had moved out towards Waterloo. Bülow's men were followed to Waterloo first by I Corps and then by II Corps.|$|E

25|$|The {{fight was}} signed for May 22, 1993, and was staged at RFK Stadium in Washington, DC. Ferguson {{came into the}} fight below 230 pounds {{for the first time}} in years and was {{considered}} to be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shape</b> of his career. Because the IBF did not consider Ferguson to be a legitimate contender, they would not sanction the defense for Bowe and only the WBA and lineal championships were on the line. Ferguson thought he had a legitimate chance to knock the champion out, but Bowe disregarded his boasts. Ferguson was knocked down toward the end of the first round and barely made it back to his feet at the bell, then was dropped again as the second round began and knocked out.|$|E

His second volume of poems, Passport to the War, was published fourteen years later; the book went largely unnoticed, although it featured some of Kunitz's best-known poems, and soon fell out of print. Kunitz's confidence was not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> of <b>shape</b> when, <b>in</b> 1959, he had trouble finding a publisher for his third book, Selected Poems: 1928-1958.

2500|$|By March 2002, Woodland Cemetery {{suffered}} extensively lack of maintenance. Numerous headstones and mausoleums {{had been}} defaced by graffiti, many gravestones had been toppled and some destroyed, and the grounds were strewn with trash and liquor bottles. Most of the cemetery's unpaved roads were impassable. [...] When Plain Dealer reporters interviewed Jim Glending, acting city properties chief, about the cemetery, he ordered {{an assessment of}} each cemetery so a repair and maintenance plan could be developed. While the public and press blamed the very small budget for cemetery maintenance for the problems, some did not. Vicki Blum Vigil, {{author of a book}} on Cuyahoga County cemeteries, claimed that maintenance at Woodland Cemetery was better than at many privately owned cemeteries. Vigil blamed vandalism and an increasing number of cemetery visitors for Woodland's problems. The Plain Dealer report led to extensive maintenance improvements at Woodland over the next three months. Although mausoleums remains in disrepair and heavier monuments remained toppled due to lack of equipment to right them, a spokesperson for the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War claimed the cemetery was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shape</b> it had been in for the past ten years.|$|E
50|$|The 1973 {{oil crisis}} caused {{significant}} changes at Dodge, {{as well as}} Chrysler as a whole.

In fairness, this was true of most American automakers at the time, but Chrysler was also not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> financial <b>shape</b> {{to do anything about}} it. Consequently, while General Motors and Ford were quick to begin downsizing their largest cars, Chrysler (and Dodge) moved more slowly out of necessity.|$|R

2500|$|In {{his plans}} to {{recapture}} Shandong, Zhang Zongchang {{had a number of}} important assets: firstly, tens of thousands of his former soldiers still remained in Shandong. Most of them {{had not been able to}} join the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) after Zhang's defeat, and remained unemployed. In a precarious economic situation and mostly still loyal to their old commander, they joined his forces for a second time. These ex-soldiers were not necessarily reliable nor combat-effective, however. In the face of the Nationalist forces during the Northern Expedition, Zhang's followers had [...] "melted away without putting up much of a fight", and were even more lacking in training and weaponry now that they had been demobilized. While Zhang's forces were not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shape,</b> they had the advantage of not having to face regular NRA troops in eastern Shandong, as the area was under the control of Zhang's former associate Liu Zhennian. Liu had defected to the Nationalists during the Northern Expedition, and was awarded to rule eastern Shandong like an [...] "unreformed warlord" [...] without intervention since October 1928. Although de jure part of the NRA, Liu's forces were typical of the average warlord, and suffered from little training in comparison to regular armies. Liu was not particularly loyal to the Nationalist government in Nanjing, and he had no support from the local population which he had terrorized, having driven them into rebellion in some areas. The counties of Laiyang and Zhaoyuan were held by Red Spear Society peasant insurgents by early 1929. Lastly, Zhang possibly had covert support from the Empire of Japan, which increased his confidence in recapturing Shandong.|$|E

60|$|A tin vessel of {{the shape}} {{shown in the}} sketch, and {{large enough to hold}} a quart, is, I believe, the easiest to carry, the cleanest, and the most durable of small water-vessels. The curve in its shape is to allow of its {{accommodating}} itself {{to the back of the}} man who carries it. The tin loops at its sides are to admit the strap by which it is to be slung, and which passes through the loops underneath the bottom of the vessel, so that the weight may rest directly upon the strap. Lastly, the vessel has a pipette for drinking through, and a larger hole by which it is to be filled, and which at other times is stopped with a cork or wooden plug. When drinking out of the pipette, the cork must be loosened in order to admit air, like a vent hole. Macintosh bags, for wine or water, are very convenient to carry and they will remain water-tight for a long period when fairly used. (Mem.--Oil and grease are as fatal to macintosh as they are to iron rust.) But the taste that these vessels impart to their contents is abominable, not only at first but for a very long time; in two-thirds of them it is never to be got rid of. Never believe shopkeepers in an india-rubber shop, in their assurances to the contrary; they are incompetent to judge aright, for their senses seem vitiated by the air they live <b>in.</b> <b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>shape</b> for a small macintosh water-vessel has yet to be determined. Several alpine men use them; and their most recent patterns may probably best be seen at Carter's, Alpine Outfitter, Oxford Street. A flask of dressed hide (pig, goat, or dog) with a wooden nozzle, and a wooden plug to fit into it, is very good. Canvas bags, smeared with grease on the outside, will become nearly waterproof after a short soaking. A strong glass flask may be made out of a soda-water bottle; it should have raw hide shrunk upon it to preserve it from sharp taps Likely to make a crack. Calabashes and other gourds, cocoa-nuts and ostrich eggs, are all of them excellent for flasks. The Bushmen of South Africa make great use of ostrich shells as water-vessels. They have stations at many places in the desert, where they bury these shells filled with water, corked with grass, and occasionally waxed over. They thus go without hesitation over wide tracts, for their sense of locality is so strong that they never fear to forget the spot in which they have dug their hiding-place.|$|E

50|$|Soap operas {{continued}} to air during the strike; however, without experienced script writers many suffered in quality.

The animation exemption also led to several animated specials being aired, including a new Peanuts miniseries (This Is America, Charlie Brown) and an adaptation of a Garfield book, Garfield: His 9 Lives.|$|R

The method, which consists <b>in</b> choosing <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>shape</b> of external periodic excitations permitting to avoid the transverse intersection of the stable and unstable manifolds of the hilltop saddle, is first illustrated and then applied by using the Melnikov method for analytically detecting homoclinic bifurcations. Attention is focused on optimal excitations with a finite number of superharmonics, because they are theoretically performant and easy to reproduce. Extensive numerical investigations aimed at confirming the theoretical predictions and checking the effectiveness of the method are performed. <b>In</b> particular, <b>the</b> elimination of the homoclinic tangency and the regularization of fractal basins of attraction are numerically verified.
