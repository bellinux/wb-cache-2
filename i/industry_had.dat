5|$|By 1911 {{the textile}} {{industry}} in Bolton employed about 36,000 people. The last mill to be constructed was Sir John Holden's Mill in 1927. The cotton industry declined from the 1920s. A brief upturn after the Second World War was not sustained, and the <b>industry</b> <b>had</b> virtually vanished {{by the end}} of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s, 37% of Roskilde's {{economy was}} in crafts and {{manufacturing}} industry with only 15% in administration and services. By 1984, <b>industry</b> <b>had</b> dropped to 16% while services {{had risen to}} 57%. In 2002, services had reached 62%, leaving industry at 15% and trade and transport at 22%.|$|E
5|$|The A Station {{had been}} {{operated}} by the London Power Company, {{but by the time}} the B Station was completed, the UK's electric supply <b>industry</b> <b>had</b> been nationalised, and ownership of the two stations had passed into the hands of the British Electricity Authority in 1948. In 1955, this became the Central Electricity Authority, which in turn became the Central Electricity Generating Board in 1957.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe parametrically {{estimate}} total-factor {{energy efficiency}} (TFEE) scores for 10 industries in 14 developed countries {{for the period}} 1995 - 2005 using stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) technique. The model includes four inputs (labor, capital stock, energy, and non-energy intermediate inputs) and one output (value added). Unlike previous studies that use data envelopment analysis (DEA), our method can take into account statistical noises. The results show that More {{than half of the}} <b>industries</b> <b>have</b> insignificant changes in the inefficiency trend. However, construction, paper, and textile <b>industries</b> <b>have</b> significantly increasing inefficiency (decreasing efficiency). The metal industry is the only <b>industry</b> which <b>has</b> decreasing inefficiency (increasing efficiency). As a result, most of the OECD <b>industries</b> <b>have</b> much room in improving their total-factor energy efficiency.

5|$|Almost all of Ukraine {{had been}} {{occupied}} by the Germans, and Khrushchev returned to his domain in late 1943 to find devastation. Ukraine's <b>industry</b> <b>had</b> been destroyed, and agriculture faced critical shortages. Even though millions of Ukrainians had been taken to Germany as workers or prisoners of war, there was insufficient housing for those who remained. One out of every six Ukrainians was killed in World War II.|$|E
5|$|By 1930, {{the wine}} <b>industry</b> <b>had</b> {{weakened}} {{due to the}} Great Depression and Prohibition. Many vineyards that survived by supplying the home market were located in California's Central Valley, a non-optimal environment for growing quality Zinfandel. Thus, the end of Prohibition left a shortage of quality wine grapes, and Zinfandel sank into obscurity as most was blended into undistinguished fortified wines. However, some producers remained interested in making single varietal red wines.|$|E
5|$|By 1943, the Allies {{had gained}} air superiority over Germany, and bombings of German cities and <b>industry</b> <b>had</b> become commonplace. However, the Allies in their {{strategic}} bombing campaign did not concentrate on industry, and Speer {{was able to}} overcome bombing losses. In spite of these losses, German production of tanks {{more than doubled in}} 1943, production of planes increased by 80 percent, and production time for Kriegsmarine submarines was reduced from one year to two months. Production would continue to increase until the second half of 1944.|$|E

30|$|From Table  1, we {{can observe}} that export {{promotion}} effect is positive, and export substitution effect and inverse import effect are negative, so the total effect of Japan’s outward FDI is negative. In export promotion effect A, transportation equipment <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> {{the most positive}} impact on domestic production. In export promotion effect B, iron and steel <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> the most positive impact and transportation equipment industry ranked second. In export substitution effect, transportation equipment <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> the most negative effect. In inverse import effect, information and communication electronics equipment industry and transportation equipment <b>industry</b> <b>have</b> very huge impact. In both total effect case A and case B, transportation equipment <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> the most impact and it is negative, which {{is the main reason}} that caused total effect of Japan’s outward FDI to be negative. Also, among three effects, export substitution effect is even greater other twos which determined total effect.|$|R
5|$|Early investors earned {{three to}} four times their money back due to {{increasing}} property values in Southern California, high occupancy rates, and increasing storage rental prices. By the mid-1980s, Public Storage was raising $200 to $300 million in investments each year. The RELP format allowed the firm to continue building more locations in the 1970s and 1980s when most of the <b>industry</b> <b>had</b> halted growth because of higher interest rates on loans. In the mid-1980s, co-founder Volk retired and his interest in Public Storage was purchased by Hughes. Forbes estimated that by this time the company was worth $800 million.|$|E
5|$|Gagak Item was {{released}} in late 1939 and was screened in Batavia (now Jakarta), {{the capital of the}} Indies; Medan, North Sumatra; and Surabaya, eastern Java. Some screenings of the film, also advertised under the Dutch title De Zwarte Raaf, had Dutch-language subtitles. A novelisation of the film, published by the Yogyakarta-based Kolff-Buning, soon followed. Gagak Item was one of four domestic productions released in 1939; the film <b>industry</b> <b>had</b> undergone a significant downturn following the onset of the Great Depression, during which time cinemas mainly showed Hollywood productions, and had only begun recovering following the release of Terang Boelan.|$|E
5|$|In 1778, the British Army {{burned the}} city in {{retaliation}} for the acts of local privateers. The fire destroyed 34 ships, 76 shops, 26 storehouses and 11 homes. After independence, the city concentrated on rebuilding its major industry, and in 1791, the Rebecca set sail, becoming the first American whaler to harvest oil from the Pacific. Two decades later, the War of 1812 again took a toll on the industry, which recovered again and by 1823, New Bedford's fleet equalled Nantucket's in tonnage. Four years later the city's whaling <b>industry</b> <b>had</b> surpassed the island's in barrels produced.|$|E

5000|$|Tom Randall, a {{correspondent}} specializing in renewable energy for Bloomberg, calls to attention that {{wind and solar}} (energy sources) are [...] "outperforming" [...] fossil fuels. In terms of investments, clean energy outperforms both gas and coal by a 2-1 margin. This positive margin {{may be attributed to}} the consistently falling price of renewable energy production. Renewable energy sources hold assertive advantages over fossil fuels because they exist as technologies, not fuels. As time proceeds, renewable energy becomes inevitably more efficient as technology adapts. Technologies for extracting fuels may change, but the fuels remain as constants. Both the solar and wind <b>industries</b> <b>have</b> proven growth over time: Over the last 15 years, the solar <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> doubled seven times and the wind <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> doubled four times. In contrast, the fossil fuel <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> declined over the last 15 years. America's coal <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> lost 75 percent of its value within the past few years.|$|R

Several Bollywood actors and the South Indian film <b>industry</b> <b>had</b> boycotted the event, over the alleged killing of Tamilian civilians at the height of the conflict between the Sri Lanka Army and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in 2009. The rumours of her visit to Colombo started after her friend Ritesh Deshmukh was seen at the festival in Colombo. Immediately, various Tamil groups and Kollywood associations demanded her films to be banned.|$|E
5|$|In {{recent years}} the Dutch brick {{industry}} has attracted unwelcome attention from the European Union (EU) competition authorities. In the early 1990s the <b>industry</b> <b>had</b> excess capacity due to technological advances, competition from other materials and an economic slowdown. Producers with combined market share of 90% agreed to reduce capacity, shutting down the older and inefficient plants. The producers compensated those who closed plants. However, the agreement also included fixing production quotas and fining members who produced more than their quota. The members of what was in effect a cartel were forced to drop the quota agreement by the EU.|$|E

5|$|Longyearbyen is {{the centre}} of tourism on the archipelago, {{although}} most tourism is generated based on natural experiences rather than visiting the town itself. However, Longyearbyen does provide supplies, accommodation and several museums. In 2008, Longyearbyen experienced 89,000 guest-nights, up from 30,000 in 1995. The average guest stayed 2.2 nights and 60 percent of the capacity was used by tourists. About 40,000 tourists flew into Longyearbyen. Two-thirds of the tourists come from Norway. In 2007, the tourism <b>industry</b> <b>had</b> a revenue of NOK291 million and produced 200 man-years.|$|E
5|$|Nabulsi soap was {{traditionally}} made {{by women}} for household use, {{even before the}} appearance of small soap-making factories in the 10th century. Trade with Bedouins was indispensable for soap-making, both in Nablus and Hebron, since they alone could furnish the alkaline soda (qilw) required by the process. By the 14th century a significant soap-making <b>industry</b> <b>had</b> developed in Nablus and the soap, reputedly prized by Queen Elizabeth I of England, was exported throughout the Middle East and to Europe.|$|E
5|$|Quality {{control and}} {{standards}} were imposed on clockmakers by the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers, a guild which licensed clockmakers for doing business. By {{the rise of}} consumerism in the late 18th century, clocks, especially pocket watches, became regarded as fashion accessories and were made in increasingly decorative styles. By 1796, the industry reached a high point with almost 200,000 clocks being produced annually in London, however by the mid-19th century the <b>industry</b> <b>had</b> gone into steep decline from Swiss competition.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{empirical}} analysis of {{two types of}} industry clusters: clusters that arise exogenously due to natural advantages, and endogenously formed clusters. The Oil and Gas industry was chosen as an <b>industry</b> that would <b>have</b> exogenously clustered near natural resources. The Bio-Medical industry was chosen as an <b>industry</b> that would <b>have</b> clusters that formed endogenously. The evidence suggests that these two <b>industries</b> <b>have</b> clusters that experience very different firm performance gains and losses in comparison to other non-clustered firms in their industries. The Oil and Gas <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> positive performance and growth associated with firms inside clusters.
