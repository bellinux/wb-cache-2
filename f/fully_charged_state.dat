40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{pioneering}} study of Spitzer, {{it has been}} widely recognised that grains {{play an important role}} in the heating and cooling of photo-ionised environments. A detailed code is necessary to model grains in a photo-ionised medium. In this paper we will use the spectral synthesis code Cloudy for this purpose. The grain model of this code has recently undergone a comprehensive upgrade. Part of this is the newly developed hybrid grain charge model, which will be described in detail. This model allows discrete <b>charge</b> <b>states</b> of very small grains to be modelled accurately while simultaneously avoiding the overhead of <b>fully</b> resolving the <b>charge</b> distribution of large grains, thus making the model both accurate and computationally efficient. A comprehensive comparison with the <b>fully</b> resolved <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> models of Weingartner & Draine (2001) shows that the agreement is very satisfactory for realistic size distributions. The effect of the grain size distribution on the line emission from photo-ionised regions is studied by taking standard models for an H II region and a planetary nebula and adding a dust component to the models with varying grain size distributions. A comparison of the models shows that varying the size distribution has a dramatic effect on the emitted spectrum, and affects the ionisation balance as well. These results clearly demonstrate that the grain size distribution is an important parameter in photo-ionisation models...|$|R

The paper focuses on the form of the Butler-Volmer equation in the model. It is shown how practical problems can be avoided by taking care in the form used, particularly to avoid difficulties when the solid particle in the electrodes approaches a <b>fully</b> <b>charged</b> or discharged <b>state</b> or the electrolyte gets depleted.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the role of}} the solvent in the {{formation}} of the charge-separated excited state of 9, 9 '-bianthryl (BA) is examined by means of mixed molecular mechanical/quantum mechanical (QM/MM) calculations. It is shown that in weakly polar solvents a relaxed excited state is formed with an interunit angle that is significantly smaller than 90 degrees. This relaxed excited state has a considerable dipole moment even in weakly polar solvents; for benzene and dioxane dipole moments of ca. 6 D were calculated, which is close to experimental data. These dipoles are induced by the solvent in the highly polarizable relaxed excited state of BA, and the dipole relaxation time is governed by solvent reorganizations. In polar solvent the charge separation is driven to completion by the stronger dipoles in the solvent and a <b>fully</b> <b>charged</b> separated excited <b>state</b> is formed with an interunit angle of 90 degrees...|$|R

50|$|Duracell further {{suggests}} that a trickle charge at C/300 {{can be used for}} batteries that must be kept in a <b>fully</b> <b>charged</b> <b>state.</b> Some chargers do this after the charge cycle, to offset natural self-discharge. A similar approach is suggested by Energizer, which indicates that self-catalysis can recombine gas formed at the electrodes for charge rates up to C/10. This leads to cell heating. The company recommends C/30 or C/40 for indefinite applications where long life is important. This is the approach taken in emergency lighting applications, where the design remains essentially the same as in older NiCd units, except for an increase in the trickle-charging resistor value.|$|E

Cells can be {{manufactured in the}} <b>fully</b> <b>charged</b> <b>state</b> and retain capacity well. Their capacity is about 2/3 that of primary cells. They are of dry-cell construction, completely sealed and not requiring maintenance. Cells have a limited cycle life, which is affected by deep discharge; the first cycle gives the greatest capacity, and if deeply discharged a cell may only provide 20 cycles. The available energy on each cycle decreases. Like primary alkaline cells, they have a relatively high internal resistance, making them unsuitable for high discharge current (for example, discharging their full capacity in one hour).|$|E

Lithium polysulfide species formed in a sulfur cathode during cycling {{are characterized by}} Raman experiments {{for the first time}} and their structures are examined with regard to three different electrolytes at <b>fully</b> <b>charged</b> and discharged <b>states.</b> Moreover, ex-situ Raman studies give the evidence for the formation of lithium polysulfide on a Li metal anode by shuttle phenomena and the coexistence of soluble lithium polysulfide with elemental sulfur even after full charge. It was found that 1, 3 -dioxolane (DOX) / 1 M LiTFSI facilitates the migration of soluble lithium polysulfide toward a lithium anode and initiates a polysulfide shuttle causing a considerable capacity loss in lithium-sulfur cells. Raman results and cycling tests using an air-tight cell demonstrated that tetra(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether (TEGDME) -based electrolytes hindered the significant overcharge and led to the formation of Li 2 S 2 contributing to high discharge capacity through further electrochemical reduction to Li 2 S. close 1...|$|R

30|$|The {{contributions}} {{of this study}} are as follows. Firstly, mass data of BELVs operating in Beijing, China, was collected, which actually record the daily operation of the vehicles. The information regarding vehicle operating state and battery status, under the regular driving behavior and conditions, is included in the data. The collected data have universal significance for the BELVs in Beijing, China, and other similar areas. Secondly, a data-based modeling method was adopted to establish the model for driving distance estimation. During the modeling process, the relation between percentage of energy consumption per kilometer (POECPK) and driving speed was explored based on the experimental data. The results indicate a novel finding about the relation between POECPK and driving speed for BELVs. Finally, the proposed model was applied to explore economical driving speed for BELVs, which can run the longest driving distance from a <b>fully</b> <b>charged</b> <b>state</b> to a certain residual SOC value. To the best knowledge of the authors, {{it is the first time}} that the mass data of BELVs, recording the actual operating process of vehicles and batteries, are applied to estimate the driving distance and explore the economical driving speed.|$|E

Organolead halide perovskite possesses high light absorption coefficient and enables thin and semitransparent photovoltaic device.

30|$|Coating cathode {{materials}} with metallic oxides {{are able to}} significantly improve the cycle performances of LNMO.

[93] investigated the morphology, structures, and performances of the SiO 2 -coated LNMO cathode materials for HVLIBs. The results indicate that the surfaces of the coated LNMO samples were covered with porous, amorphous, nanostructured SiO 2 layers and the capacity retention rates were obviously improved. Lee et al. [94] utilized SnO 2 coating to modify LNMO cathode by employing electron cyclotron resonance metalâorganic chemical vapor deposition and a conventional tape-casting method. The SnO 2 -deposited LNMO electrodes exhibit superior electrochemical performances during the storage test in a <b>fully</b> <b>charged</b> <b>state</b> than the pristine LNMO electrode. Wang et al. [4] synthesized V 2 O 5 -coated LNMO cathode materials via a wet-coating method. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images showed clear lattice fringes of all LNMO samples, and the V 2 O 5 coating layer was about 3 Â nm in 5 % V 2 O 5 -LNMO sample. The selected area electron diffraction pattern (SAED) suggested that the LNMO sample was of ordered lattice and single-crystal structure. The cycling performances profiles of different materials showed that the 5 % V 2 O 5 -LNMO sample had the best performance. V 2 O 5 as a protective layer inhibited the electrolyte decomposition at the electrode/electrolyte interface, offered a 2 D path for Li+ diffusion, and reduced metal-ion dissolution, thereby improving the structure integrity and capacity retention during charge/discharge cycles.|$|E
