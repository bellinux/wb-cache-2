5000|$|Corded window blinds {{present a}} {{strangulation}} hazard to children, causing 184 {{deaths in the}} United States between 1996 and 2012. Recalls of window covering products have not significantly {{reduced the number of}} deaths since 1980. Retrofit kits have been used since 1995 to [...] "reduce" [...] the strangulation hazard; however, children have strangled on retrofit kits since 1995. The US CPSC recommends using cordless or cord-free window coverings where children live or visit. For window coverings that use continuous-loop cord systems, like vertical blinds, a wall cord cleat can be used to anchor the cord tightly to the wall and prevent children from having access to the dangling cord loop. Window blinds slats are held together with cords that allow for tilting slats, raising or lowering, and these are potentially dangerous if loose. As an added precaution, cord stops should be installed correctly and adjusted to restrict the movement of <b>inner</b> <b>lift</b> cords.|$|E
40|$|In a triple-port burner, various non-premixed flames {{have been}} {{observed}} previously. Especially for the case with two lifted flames, such configuration could be suitable in studying interaction between two tribrachial flames. In the present study, the flame characteristics have been investigated numerically by adopting a reduced kinetic mechanism in the triple-port burner. Four different types of flame configurations, including two attached flames, inner lifted/outer attached flames, <b>inner</b> attached/outer <b>lifted</b> flames, and twin lifted flames, were successfully simulated depending on the flow conditions. The representative edge propagation speed of a single lifted flame or an upstream lifted flame {{in the case of}} twin lifted flames increased as the liftoff height became higher. In the twin <b>lifted</b> flames, the <b>inner</b> <b>lifted</b> flame was affected appreciably when the other flame was located further upstream such that the lifted flame located further downstream encountered the axial velocity acceleration induced by the gas expansion from the lifted flame located upstream, while thermal effects were not observed since the temperature of the incoming flow toward the lifted flame was not affected. A unique flip-flop behavior between the inner and outer flames, observed experimentally previously, was successfully captured in the simulation such that the <b>inner</b> <b>lifted</b> flame became attached to the nozzle as the liftoff height of the outer lifted flame grew higher with an increase in the outer air velocity...|$|R

For an <b>inner</b> thigh <b>lift,</b> the surgeon makes an incision high on the inner leg, starting near the groin and continuing down to the knee. Some fat may be removed with liposuction. The surgeon then removes excess skin and redrapes the remaining skin before closing the long incision, leaving the patient with tighter and more attractive thighs.|$|R

60|$|While John Inglefield and {{his family}} were sitting round the hearth with the shadows dancing behind them on the wall, the outer door was opened, and a light {{footstep}} came along the passage. The latch of the <b>inner</b> door was <b>lifted</b> by some familiar hand, and a young girl came in, wearing a cloak and hood, which she took off, and laid on the table beneath the looking-glass. Then, after gazing a moment at the fireside circle, she approached, and took the seat at John Inglefield's right hand, {{as if it had been}} reserved on purpose for her.|$|R
60|$|Rupert, {{without a}} word, sprang upon {{the man and}} bore him to the ground. Then, seeing {{that there was an}} <b>inner</b> room, he <b>lifted</b> him, and ran him in there, the man being too {{astonished}} to offer the slightest resistance. Then Rupert locked him in, and taking down the great key of the gate, which hung over the fireplace, went out, closed the great gate of the town, locked it on the outside, and threw the key into the moat. Then he went off at a run and joined the marquis, who with Adele was waiting anxiously at the distance he had asked him.|$|R
40|$|We studied {{premixed}} gas combustion experimentally using annular nozzles which have coaxial bluffbody in a pipe. Cross-sectional area of nozzles is kept constant, while the opening width between the inner surface of nozzles {{and the outer}} surface of bluffbody is varied. We find that an annular nozzle has four flame patterns : flame attached to outer edge, flame attached to both outer and inner edges, flame attached to <b>inner</b> edge and <b>lifted</b> flame. Each flame pattern is dependent on mixture gas velocity and the equivalence ratio. Furthermore, each flame pattern region {{is affected by the}} ratio of the inner diameter to the outer diameter of the annular nozzle. This ratio has an optimum value, which gives maximum velocity at the lean limit in the region of flame attached to inner edge...|$|R
40|$|To date, obesity {{affects a}} {{substantial}} population in industrialised countries. Due {{to the increased}} awareness of obesity-related morbidity, efficient dietary regimens and the recent successes with bariatric surgery, {{there is now a}} high demand for body contouring surgery to correct skin abundancies after massive weight loss. The known risks for this type of surgery are mainly wound-healing complications, and, more rarely, thromboembolic or respiratory complications. We present two female patients (23 and 39 years of age) who, in spite of standard positioning and precautions, developed sciatic neuropathy after combined body contouring procedures, including abdominoplasty and <b>inner</b> thigh <b>lift.</b> Complete functional loss of the sciatic nerve was found by clinical and electroneurographic examination on the left side in patient one and bilaterally in patient two. Full nerve conductance recovery was obtained after 6 months in both patients. Although the occurrence of spontaneous neuropathies after heavy weight loss is well documented, this is the first report describing the appearance of such a phenomenon following body contouring surgery. One theoretical explanation may be the compression of the nerve during the semirecumbent positioning combined with hip flexion and abduction, which was required for abdominal closure and simultaneous access to the inner thighs. We advise to avoid this positioning and to include the risk of sciatic neuropathy in the routine preoperative information of patients scheduled for body contouring surgery after heavy weight loss...|$|R
5000|$|The Triavion's {{fuselage}} was rectangular in cross-section, flat sided and bottomed but {{topped with}} a triangular section decking through which the wings passed. The forward wing was braced to the lower fuselage longerons with two pairs of parallel lift struts on each side, one pair to the neutral <b>lift</b> <b>inner</b> section {{and the other to}} the outer panels. These pairs had horizontal and vertical jury struts between them. A pair of N-form struts angled outwards from the upper longerons to form a cabane supporting the centre section of the wing. The shorter rear wing needed only a single parallel pair on each side from the lower fuselage with similar upper longeron N-struts. Its [...] six cylinder, radial Anzani engine was mounted in the nose. The forward cockpit was just under a V-shaped cut-out in the centre section trailing edge and the second was midway between the two wings; both were within the triangular decking, which had large openings in it, and there were also round apertures in the sides to improve downward vision. Both cockpits were accessed via starboard-side doors. The empennage was conventional, with a large, upright fin and a vertical edged unbalanced rudder that went down to the keel; the cantilever tailplane and elevators were rectangular in plan, with rounded corners and a cut-out for rudder movement, and were mounted a little lower than the wings on the upper fuselage longerons. It had conventional landing gear with mainwheels on a single axle rubber sprung to V-struts from the lower fuselage, their rear members part of a transverse inverted W-form strut also joined to the central fuselage. There was a short tailskid.|$|R
40|$|Car {{seats for}} smaller children, offers very good {{protection}} incase of a collision. Unfortunately for the parents’ sake, these car seats is heavy to handle outside the car. For example {{back and forth}} home and short errands around town. In other words, all those times when you decide to just take out the car seat and carry it instead of place the baby in a baby carrier. By analyzing where and how the car seat is being used. How best to carry heavier loads up to about 15 kg as a car seat with the child can weigh and by {{taking into account the}} child ’s and the parents anatomy. This work led to a concept on how this problem can be solved. Various technical principle solutions have been developed and evaluated. The chosen solution has then been further developed by various design approaches where form and expression has been the important part. The main body of the new solution is a softer <b>inner</b> which you <b>lifts</b> out when you leave the car. The baby sits in a carrier that the parent carries in front of their body. Remaining in the car is a chair-like base with ”click” fasteners that lock the softer part in place when it´s placed in the car, with the baby in it. The major benefits of solving it this way is that the baby is carried in front of the body without oblique loaded lifting on the spine. While the solution also itself weighs several pounds less than the current car seats. It also frees the parents both hands by carrying the child this way. All this leads to a gentler living for the parents...|$|R
40|$|The Assembly Transfer System (ATS) receives, cools, {{and opens}} rail and truck {{transportation}} casks from the Carrier/Cask Handling System (CCHS). The system unloads transportation casks consisting of bare Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) assemblies, single element canisters, and Dual Purpose Canisters (DPCs). For casks containing DPCs, the system opens the DPCs and unloads the SNF. The system stages the assemblies, transfer assemblies {{to and from}} fuel-blending inventory pools, loads them into Disposal Containers (DCs), temporarily seals and inerts the DC, decontaminates the DC and transfers it to the Disposal Container Handling System. The system also prepares empty casks and DPCs for off-site shipment. Two identical Assembly Transfer System lines are provided in the Waste Handling Building (WHB). Each line operates independently to handle the waste transfer throughput and to support maintenance operations. Each system line primarily consists of wet and dry handling areas. The wet handling area includes a cask transport system, cask and DPC preparation system, and a wet assembly handling system. The basket transport system forms the transition between the wet and dry handling areas. The dry handling area includes the dry assembly handling system, assembly drying system, DC preparation system, and DC transport system. Both the wet and dry handling areas are controlled by the control and tracking system. The system operating sequence begins with moving transportation casks to the cask preparation area. The cask preparation operations consist of cask cavity gas sampling, cask venting, cask cool-down, outer lid removal, and <b>inner</b> shield plug <b>lifting</b> fixture attachment. Casks containing bare SNF (no DPC) are filled with water {{and placed in the}} cask unloading pool. The inner shield plugs are removed underwater. For casks containing a DPC, the cask lid(s) is removed, and the DPC is penetrated, sampled, vented, and cooled. A DPC lifting fixture is attached and the cask is placed into the cask unloading pool. In the cask unloading pool the DPC is removed from the cask and placed in an overpack and the DPC lid is severed and removed. Assemblies are removed from either an open cask or DPC and loaded into assembly baskets positioned in the basket staging rack in the assembly unloading pool. A method called ''blending'' is utilized to load DCs with a heat output of less than 11. 8 kW. This involves combining hotter and cooler assemblies from different baskets. Blending requires storing some of the hotter fuel assemblies in fuel-blending inventory pools until cooler assemblies are available. The assembly baskets are then transferred from the basket staging rack to the assembly handling cell and loaded into the assembly drying vessels. After drying, the assemblies are removed from the assembly drying vessels and loaded into a DC positioned below the DC load port. After installation of a DC inner lid and temporary sealing device, the DC is transferred to the DC decontamination cell where the top area of the DC, the DC lifting collar, and the DC inner lid and temporary sealing device are decontaminated, and the DC is evacuated and backfilled with inert gas to prevent prolonged clad exposure to air. The DC is then transferred to the Disposal Container Handling System for lid welding. In another cask preparation and decontamination area, lids are replaced on the empty transportation casks and DPC overpacks, the casks and DPC overpacks are decontaminated, inspected, and transferred to the Carrier/Cask Handling System for shipment off-site. All system equipment is designed to facilitate manual or remote operation, decontamination, and maintenance. The system interfaces with the Carrier/Cask Handling System for incoming and outgoing transportation casks and DPCs. The system also interfaces with the Disposal Container Handling System, which prepares the DC for loading and subsequently seals the loaded DC. The system support interfaces are the Waste Handling Building System and other internal WHB support systems...|$|R
