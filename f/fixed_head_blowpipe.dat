50|$|The <b>Fixed</b> <b>Head</b> Coupé (FHC) {{shared the}} DHC's {{interior}} trim and rear seat. The prototype <b>Fixed</b> <b>Head</b> Coupe retained the XK120 <b>Fixed</b> <b>Head</b> roof-profile, {{with the front}} wings and doors {{the same as the}} Drophead. In production, the roof was lengthened with the screen being placed further forward, shorter front wings, and longer doors. This resulted in more interior space, and more legroom.|$|R
50|$|At its 1919 {{introduction}} three body types were listed; a tourer, coupé and landaulette. These {{were joined}} in 1921 by the Ranelagh <b>fixed</b> <b>head,</b> two-door, coupé. For 1922 the Grosvenor limousine and landaulette, a Ranelagh four-door, <b>fixed</b> <b>head,</b> coupé and Westminster drop-head coupé were added.|$|R

50|$|Four {{different}} {{tape punch}} units {{are available for}} use with the Model 28 ASR. These are the non-typing perforator (LPE), typing perforator (LTPE), non-typing reperforator (LRPE) and typing reperforator (LPR). Similarly, there are four different tape reader options. These are the <b>fixed</b> <b>head</b> single contact transmitter-distributor (LXD), pivoted head multi-contact transmitter-distributor (LAXD), <b>fixed</b> <b>head</b> multi-contact transmitter-distributor (LBXD) and pivoted and <b>fixed</b> <b>head</b> multi-contact transmitter-distributor (LCXD). There is also an option that installs a second tape punch, usually a typing reperforator (LPR) under the dome just behind the tape reader. The second tape punch is driven by its own motor.|$|R

50|$|The S3 Continental was {{strictly}} coachbuilt. Most bodies {{were of the}} altered HJM style, available in <b>fixed</b> <b>head</b> or drop head coupe form. Of the 328 coachbuilt S3 (Continentals included here), nearly 100 were by MPW. Again, <b>fixed</b> <b>head</b> or a drop head coupe configurations were available. The most prominent visual difference from the S2 configuration was the four canted headlights.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{mass storage}} device, {{known as a}} RAD (random-access disk), {{contains}} 512 <b>fixed</b> <b>heads</b> and a large (approx 600 mm/24 in diameter) vertically mounted disk spinning at relatively low speeds. Because of the <b>fixed</b> <b>head</b> arrangement, access is quite fast. Capacities range from 1.6 to 6.0 megabytes and are used for temporary storage. Large-capacity multi-platter disks are employed for permanent storage.|$|R

50|$|The Model 28 Tape Readers, {{also known}} as a transmitter-distributors, are transmitting-only five, six, seven or eight level devices that {{automatically}} converts chadless or fully perforated paper tape into electrical impulses. These devices are self-contained and motor-driven and operate at speeds up to 200 words-per-minute. In some equipment, these electrical signals are transmitted sequentially over a single telegraph channel to local or remote receiving stations. In other cases, the tape readers will provide output on a parallel-wire basis. The Model 28 family of tape readers includes the <b>fixed</b> <b>head</b> single contact transmitter-distributor (LXD), pivoted head multi-contact transmitter-distributor (LAXD), <b>fixed</b> <b>head</b> multi-contact transmitter-distributor (LBXD), pivoted and <b>fixed</b> <b>head</b> multi-contact transmitter-distributor (LCXD) and tape reader parallel-wire transmitter (LX).|$|R

50|$|Debuting in November 1960, it was {{initially}} an 1172 with revised front styling. It was made {{available as a}} bodyshell or with an Ashley chassis. It could be had as a drophead or a <b>fixed</b> <b>head</b> coupe with two or four seats. Later Sportiva's had a revised rear with boot lid and a longer wheelbase of eight feet to accommodate the new Mark 6 chassis. The <b>fixed</b> <b>head</b> coupe bodyshell retailed for £182.|$|R
50|$|Two of the roadsters, at least, were coach-built as <b>fixed</b> <b>head</b> coupés. However at {{this time}} many very small {{businesses}} indeed offered low-cost glass-fibre-reinforced removable tops for all brands of open sports-cars. There is one fibreglass new drophead, and one fibreglass <b>fixed</b> <b>head</b> coupé (with a Hillman Minx Californian three piece rear window!!)One-offs {{seem to have been}} mostly done on Roadster allocated chassis, so there may have been even fewer roadsters built than officially indicated.|$|R
50|$|The postwar range {{contained}} two and four-door saloons a drophead coupé and a <b>fixed</b> <b>head</b> coupé. As usual {{bare chassis}} were available.|$|R
50|$|The 2835 storage Control {{connects to}} one or two block {{multiplexer}} channels and attaches one or two 2305 <b>Fixed</b> <b>Head</b> storage Modules.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with the}} hatchback, two {{two-seater}} coupé variants of the Mark III were also produced. A Drophead Coupé convertible, while not common, still considerably outnumbers the <b>Fixed</b> <b>Head</b> Coupé - 84 {{of the former}} were produced, while just five of the latter were built. All five <b>Fixed</b> <b>Head</b> Coupés were built {{close to the end}} of Mark III production and feature the mid-spec DBD engine. Both of these bodystyles feature conventional hinged boot lids rather than the innovative hatch back.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the adequacy of the current placement of <b>fixed</b> <b>head</b> air samplers and continuous air monitors (CAMs) in the 2706 -T and 2706 -TA Complex. The airflow study consisted of 6 configurations of facility HVAC and HEPA filtration equipment to determine impacts on CAM location. The results of this study provide recommendations based on guidance in DOE G 411. 1 - 8 and NUREG- 1400 for placement of <b>fixed</b> <b>head</b> air samplers or CAMS within 2706 -T and 2706 -TA...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "x2F" [...] , as in Model A2F, unit is {{a normal}} x2 unit, but its two HDAs also have a <b>Fixed</b> <b>Head</b> area over the first five cylinders, thereby {{reducing}} seek time to zero for these five cylinders. This <b>fixed</b> <b>head</b> area {{is intended to be}} allocated to the frequently accessed HASP or JES2 checkpoint area and thus greatly reduce head motion on the SPOOL device. The <b>fixed</b> <b>head</b> area can also be utilized for TSO swap data (MVT and SVS) and system swap data (MVS) wherein the swap data for SVS and MVS consist of blocks of pages that have been in memory when an address space is selected for swap-out; those pages need not be contiguous and in general do not include pages that have not been modified since their last page-in. This system architecture greatly improves context switches between TSO users or batch regions.|$|R
50|$|Production {{ended in}} October 1960, and totalled 2265 roadsters, 4445 <b>fixed</b> <b>head</b> coupés and 2672 {{drophead}} coupés. The E-Type replacement {{was announced in}} the middle of March 1961.|$|R

40|$|A data-rate {{converter}} is disclosed comprising a rotatable data-storing drum with {{at least}} one <b>fixed</b> read/record <b>head</b> and a rotatable read/record head. The latter is rotatable in a circular path about the drum axis of rotation. The drum is positionable in any one of a plurality of axial positions with respect to the heads, so that at least one drum track is aligned with the <b>fixed</b> <b>head</b> in one drum position and with the rotatable head in another drum position. When a track is aligned with the <b>fixed</b> <b>head,</b> data may be recorded therin or read out therefrom at a rate which is a function of drum rotation, while when aligned with the rotatable head, data may be recorded or read out at a rate which {{is a function of the}} rates and directions of rotation of both the drum and the head...|$|R
