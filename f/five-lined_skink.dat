25|$|Kings Gap State Park has a {{wide variety}} of wild plants and animals. Turkey {{vultures}} can be seen near the summit of the mountain. Reptiles including the box turtle, <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink,</b> copperhead snakes and timber rattlesnakes. The plant life is diverse as well. Wild blueberry, huckleberry and mountain laurel {{can be found in the}} woods with large stands of chestnut oak, white pine, larch and Douglas fir. Vernal pools appear in the springtime. These pools provide habitats and breeding area for amphibians like wood frogs, spotted salamanders, and spring peepers.|$|E
25|$|Kings Gap is {{suitable}} habitat {{for a variety}} of reptiles, including the box turtle, the <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink</b> (one of Pennsylvania's few lizards), the northern copperhead and the timber rattlesnake. Sightings of these reptiles are not uncommon in the summer months. In the Mansion Day Use Area, copperheads and rattlesnakes are sometimes seen hunting rodents along the stone walls of the mansion patio and garden. Although these snakes are venomous and should be respected, in their natural habitats they retreat when threatened. The timber rattlesnake is classified as a candidate species in Pennsylvania, which means it could receive endangered or threatened status in the future. For additional information on these reptiles, contact the center office.|$|E
50|$|<b>Five-lined</b> <b>skinks</b> can be {{maintained}} in captivity with minimal care. Some U.S. states impose general restrictions on taking reptiles including native <b>five-lined</b> <b>skinks</b> from the wild without a permit or hunting license, for example Maryland (no more than 4 may be possessed without a permit), Indiana and Ohio.|$|R
50|$|Popular {{features}} of the park include hiking trails and three beaches. There is an abundance of wildlife, including walking sticks and <b>five-lined</b> <b>skinks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Southeastern <b>five-lined</b> <b>skinks</b> {{are common}} {{inhabitants}} of wooded {{areas of the}} southeastern United States. They are commonly found on small islands off the southeastern coast {{even in the absence}} of fresh water and vegetation.|$|R
5000|$|Plestiodon marginatus, Ryūkyū <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink</b> (Okinawa and Amami Islands) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{common name}} for these lizards {{with a blue}} tail is the common <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink.</b>|$|E
50|$|Plestiodon inexpectatus, {{the southeastern}} <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink</b> {{is a common}} skink in the southeastern United States.|$|E
50|$|Young southeastern <b>five-lined</b> <b>skinks</b> have {{a bright}} blue or purplish tail, {{especially}} towards the tip. Also, stripes become a bright reddish orange towards the head. Juvenile coloration may persist into adulthood, giving {{the head of}} the animal an altogether orange-brown appearance.|$|R
50|$|<b>Five-lined</b> <b>skinks</b> are ground-dwelling animals. They prefer moist, {{partially}} wooded habitat {{that provides}} ample cover or inside walls of buildings, trees {{as well as}} sites to bask in the sun. They {{can also be found}} in broken, rocky areas at the northern edge of their habitat.|$|R
50|$|The {{parchment}} like eggs of <b>five-lined</b> <b>skinks,</b> {{similar to}} many other reptiles, are thin and easily punctured. Freshly laid eggs range from spherical to oval in shape averaging 1.3 cm in length. Absorption {{of water from the}} soil leads to increased egg size. Egg coloration also changes over time, from white to mottled tan, after contact with the nest burrow. The incubation period ranges from 24 to 55 days, and varies due to fluctuations in temperature. Females typically brood their eggs during this time, exhibiting defensive behavior against smaller predators. Parental care ends a day or two after hatching when hatchlings leave the nest. Young <b>five-lined</b> <b>skinks,</b> with a potential life span of up to six years, attain sexual maturity and begin reproducing within two to three years of hatching.|$|R
50|$|Predators {{include the}} red-winged blackbird, Pennsylvania firefly, <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink,</b> green darner, {{goldenrod}} spider, Chinese mantis, fiery searcher, and striped skunk.|$|E
50|$|This skink {{species is}} easy to {{maintain}} in captivity. It has the same requirements as the common <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink,</b> although it can tolerate dryer conditions.|$|E
50|$|As {{their common}} name suggests, southeastern five-lined skinks have five {{characteristic}} narrow stripes along their bodies that become lighter with age. The middle stripe {{tends to be}} narrower than the others, and the dark areas between stripes are black in young skinks but become brown with age. A similar lizard, the common <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink</b> (Plestiodon fasciatus), is slightly smaller than the southeastern <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink</b> and has broader stripes. However, {{it is difficult to}} discriminate between these two species on the basis of physical appearance.|$|E
50|$|Southeastern <b>five-lined</b> <b>skinks</b> are oviparous; {{the clutch}} size varies from 6 to 12, {{with the number}} of eggs {{diminishing}} with higher latitudes. The female broods the eggs and protects them from predators, including other skinks. The hatchlings appear about one month after the eggs have been laid in early summer.|$|R
50|$|<b>Five-lined</b> <b>skinks</b> also exhibit antipredation behavior. In evasion {{of various}} predators {{including}} snakes, crows, hawks, shrews, moles, opossums, skunks, raccoons, and domestic cats, skinks may disconnect their entire tail {{or a small}} segment. Skinks run to shelter to escape their distracted predators as the disconnected tail continues to twitch. Skinks may also utilize biting as a defensive strategy.|$|R
50|$|Fertilization in <b>five-lined</b> <b>skinks</b> is internal, {{with eggs}} laid by the female between {{the middle of}} May and July, at least one month after mating. The mating season begins in May. The female Plestiodon will lay its eggs in June, and {{four to six weeks}} after the incubation, the young hatch. Thus the {{birthing}} process consists of laying eggs and external incubation.|$|R
50|$|The {{specific}} name, inexpectatus ("the unexpected"), {{is possibly}} {{a reference to}} the unexpected discovery of this species in 1932, almost 175 years after Linnaeus described Plestiodon fasciatus, commonly known as the American <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink.</b>|$|E
50|$|Reptiles include timber rattlesnake, {{northern}} copperhead, eastern box turtle, common snapping turtle, and southeastern <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink.</b> Amphibians of frogs, toads, and salamanders are all common residents. Notable {{species of}} salamander include Jordan's salamander and hellbender.|$|E
50|$|The (American) <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink</b> (Plestiodon fasciatus) is {{a species}} of lizard endemic to North America. It {{is one of the}} most common lizards in the eastern U.S. and one of the seven native species of lizards in Canada.|$|E
50|$|A {{southern}} {{portion of}} this region was designated a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 2002, the Frontenac Arch Biosphere Reserve. Within this biosphere reserve is the relatively small St. Lawrence Islands National Park. Although it is small, it has many Frontenac Arch species mentioned above, including deerberry, Blanding's turtle, and <b>five-lined</b> <b>skinks.</b> Further north, there is, still a large gap in the ecological link to Algonquin Park. In this gap are smaller parks such as Frontenac Provincial Park and Bon Echo Provincial Park.|$|R
50|$|Wildcat Mountain State Park has a {{woodland}} ecosystem. The Kickapoo River Valley and {{the park}} provide a habitat for many animals typically found in the woods of the Upper Midwest. Common birds include tundra swans, Canada geese, great blue herons, sandpipers, wild turkeys, red-tailed hawks, bald eagles and turkey vultures. Reptiles are {{also found in the}} park including, <b>five-lined</b> <b>skinks,</b> red-bellied snakes and eastern hog-nosed snakes. White-tailed deer, red squirrels, and beaver are among the mammals found in the park.|$|R
5000|$|Some of the {{distinctive}} southern {{animals in the}} county include <b>five-lined</b> <b>skinks</b> (Ontario's only species of lizard), black rat snakes and southern flying squirrels. Unusual southern plants include the Arrow arum, a nationally rare wetland plant found near Mississippi Lake. [...] The south-facing cliffs over Big Rideau Lake, including Foley Mountain, have a slightly warmer climate, and therefore support an unusual southern flora including shagbark hickory, tall cinquefoil (Potentilla arguta) and a rare fern, blunt-lobed woodsia. Cliff Bennett provides a list of 26 routes for canoe and kayak exploration of the county.|$|R
50|$|Although officially a Historical Class park, the petroglyphs {{themselves}} are actually concentrated {{in a relatively}} small area of the 1643-hectare park. The rest consists of primarily woodland habitat home to several provincially rare species, such as the <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink,</b> Eumeces fasciatus.|$|E
50|$|Dalrymple (1988) reports 24 {{species of}} {{reptiles}} and amphibians collected in traps in pine rocklands on Long Pine Key. Among the most common species collected were brown anole (Anolis sagrei), eastern narrow mouthed toad (Gastrophryne carolinensis), greenhouse frog (Eleutherodactylus planirostris), southeastern <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink</b> (Eumeces inexpectatus), southern leopard frog (Rana sphenocephala), and southern toad (Bufo terrestris).|$|E
50|$|The {{wetlands}} of {{the park}} also support significant animal species including spotted turtles, Blanding’s turtles and eastern Massassauga rattlesnakes. Uplands support both the hognose snake and <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink,</b> {{both of which are}} considered species of special concern. There is also a population of fox snakes, which use offshore islands extensively, and overwinter in hibernacula in the area.|$|E
40|$|The habitat patch {{in which}} an animal resides can have {{profound}} fitness consequences. I studied habitat selection in a population of <b>Five-lined</b> <b>skinks</b> at Point Pelee National Park, Ontario, Canada. Skinks {{did not use the}} entire resource spectrum that was available. Preference was shown for larger, moderately decayed debris which provided a moist and relatively constant microclimate. Habitat selection was density-independent, suggesting that intraspecific competition does not structure the pattern of habitat use. A high level of parental care occurred, with females brooding and guarding clutches. Females varied their body contact with eggs and moved eggs vertically to control moisture. Human disturbance, centred at boardwalks, has a negative effect on skink abundance and distribution through reduction of debris. The incorporation of an Allee effect in habitat selection models is extended, and a new graphical model the 2 ̆ 2 Ideal social distribution 2 ̆ 2 is presented which may better explain patterns observed in <b>Five-lined</b> <b>skinks</b> or other social species.

50|$|Female <b>five-lined</b> <b>skinks</b> {{demonstrate}} {{high levels}} of parental care which reduces egg mortality. Females exhibit several brooding positions of variant contact levels with the body placed beside, over, through, or in a coil around the eggs. Brooding position varies according to soil moisture. Maternal body contact increases at lower moisture levels potentially reducing transpirational loss of the eggs. In communal nests, females may alternate foraging and guarding of the nests, leaving eggs protected at all times. Females may also urinate in the nests and turn eggs to maintain humidity. In addition, females transfer heat from basking through body contact. Any eggs displaced from the nest are retrieved by head or snout rolling, and rotten eggs are eaten.|$|R
50|$|Adult male <b>five-lined</b> <b>skinks</b> exhibit complex {{courtship}} {{and aggressive}} behavior. Although males tolerate juveniles and females in their territories, they actively defend these areas against other males. Vomeronasal analysis of chemical cues {{and recognition of}} sex specific visual stimuli, including tail and body coloration, aid {{in the identification of}} gender. Evidence suggests that males may rely more on contact pheromones than volatile airborne molecules in the identification of conspecifics. Courting males grasp the necks of receptive females in their jaws after approaching them from the side. Using the tail to align cloacal openings, males initiate copulation by inserting one of the two hemipenes into the female's cloaca. Copulation events typically last four to eight minutes.|$|R
50|$|In most lakes, lake trout, yellow pickerel, smallmouth and largemouth bass, lake whitefish, and {{northern}} pike {{can all be}} found. Additionally, in the more secluded areas one may see white-tailed deer, moose, black bear, red fox, beaver, and raccoons. Commonly seen mammals include eastern cottontail rabbits, eastern chipmunks, red squirrels, gray squirrels, and voles. It also hosts Ontario's only lizard, the <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink.</b>|$|E
50|$|Numerous {{wild animals}} reside in Mockingbird Valley including: white-tailed deer, red fox, groundhog, opossum, raccoon and the {{occasional}} coyote. Birding enthusiasts have also recorded sightings of wild turkey, blue heron, turkey vulture, red tail hawk, pileated woodpecker, and the great horned owl. Due to the karst topography, reptiles and amphibians such as the red salamander and <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink</b> are also common.|$|E
5000|$|The American <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink</b> {{is small}} to medium-sized, growing to about 12.5 to 21.5 cm total length. Young five-lined skinks are dark brown to black with five {{distinctive}} white to yellowish stripes {{running along the}} body and a bright blue tail. The blue color fades to light blue with age, and the stripes also may slowly disappear. The dark brown color fades, too, and older individuals are often uniformly brownish. The southeastern <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink,</b> P. inexpectatus, of the Southeastern United States {{is very similar to}} this species and there is some overlap in range. The two species can be distinguished by their scales. [...] The broad-headed skink, P. laticeps, is similar, and may be difficult to distinguish from P. fasciatus. The former species usually lacks the two enlarged postlabial scales characteristic of P. fasciatus. Adult male broad-headed skinks, with their large size and swollen red head, are readily distinguished from P. fasciatus.|$|E
50|$|Many {{species of}} animals {{can be found}} in the park, {{including}} copperhead snakes (Agkistrodon contortrix), cottonmouth snakes (A. piscivorus), American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis), and bobcats (Lynx rufus), but these are rarely observed. Animals more typically encountered by visitors include golden silk orb-weaver spiders (Nephila clavipes), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana), river frogs (Rana heckscheri), spring peeper treefrogs (Pseudacris crucifer), Carolina anole lizards (Anolis carolinensis), <b>five-lined</b> <b>skinks</b> (Eumeces fasciatus), yellow-bellied slider turtles (Trachemys scripta scripta), banded watersnakes (Nerodia fasciata), coachwhip snakes (Masticophis flagellum), eastern hognose snakes (Heterodon platirhinos), Rafinesque's big-eared bats (Corynorhinus rafinesquii), great egrets (Ardea alba), wood ducks (Aix sponsa), turkey vultures (Cathartes aura), red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), belted kingfishers (Ceryle alcyon), red-bellied woodpeckers (Melanerpes carolinus), blue-gray gnatcatchers (Polioptila caerulea), and prothonotary warblers (Protonotaria citrea).|$|R
5000|$|The Great Lakes - St. Lawrence {{population}} {{is listed as}} [...] "special concern" [...] in Ontario and Canada by COSSARO and COSEWIC, and {{it is illegal to}} remove skinks from their habitats. Skinks are at the extreme edge of their habitat range in Canada, which makes it an area of special interest to ecologists, as extreme conditions place unique evolutionary pressures upon species. <b>Five-lined</b> <b>skinks</b> have split into two phylogenetically-distinct populations in this edge habitat; the Carolinian population, also present in the United States, ends around Point Pelee National Park in southern Ontario. The Carolinian {{population is}} listed as [...] "endangered" [...] in Ontario and Canada by COSSARO, COSEWIC, [...] The St. Lawrence / Great Lakes population resides in the Ottawa Valley in eastern Ontario and tends to be more tolerant to sparse or rocky conditions than its sister subspecies.|$|R
50|$|The {{broad-headed skink}} gets {{its name from}} the wide jaws, giving the head a {{triangular}} appearance. Adult males are brown or olive brown in color and have bright orange heads during the mating season in spring. Females have five light stripes running down the back and the tail, similar to the <b>Five-lined</b> <b>Skink.</b> Juveniles are dark brown or black and also striped and have blue tails.|$|E
