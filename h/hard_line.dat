5|$|Before the 1992 Major League Baseball Draft, Hammonds {{indicated}} that he would sign if offered a $1.8 million signing bonus, which caused Hammonds to fall to the fourth overall selection, where the Baltimore Orioles selected Hammonds with their first-round draft pick. Frank Robinson, then the Orioles' assistant general manager (GM), met Hammonds at that year's College World Series while scouting, and advised Orioles GM Doug Melvin to pick Hammonds. The Orioles, regarded as frugal, held a <b>hard</b> <b>line</b> with Hammonds in negotiations, refusing to give a signing bonus as large as $1 million.|$|E
5|$|In November 1815, Louis XVIII's {{government}} had to sign another Treaty of Paris that formally ended Napoleon's Hundred Days. The previous treaty had been quite favourable to France, but this one took a <b>hard</b> <b>line.</b> France's borders were retracted to their extent at 1790. France {{had to pay for}} an army to occupy her, for at least five years, at a cost of 150million francs per year. France also had to pay a war indemnity of 700million francs to the allies.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, Welsh hopes of {{advancing}} the cause of female suffrage centred around the Liberal Party and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George, {{one of the most}} important Welsh politicians of the day. After Liberal success in the 1906 Election failed to materialise into political change, suffragettes and in particular members of the more militant Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), took a <b>hard</b> <b>line</b> stance towards their Members of Parliament, engaging in direct action against them.|$|E

5|$|As Police Commissioner Blamey {{defended the}} actions of the police during the 1928 Waterside Workers' Federation dispute, during which police opened fire, killing a {{striking}} worker who was also a Gallipoli veteran, and wounding several others. His treatment of the unionists was typical of his <b>hard</b> <b>line</b> anti-communist beliefs and as such his relations with left-wing governments were tense. Along with many senior army and ex-army officers, he was a leading member of the clandestine far-right-wing League of National Security. This was reportedly a response to the rise of communism in Australia. Its members stood ready to take up arms to stop a Catholic or communist revolution.|$|E
5|$|Biographer Lanny Ebenstein noted a drift {{over time}} in Friedman's views from an interventionist to a more {{cautious}} foreign policy. He supported US involvement in the Second World War and initially supported a <b>hard</b> <b>line</b> against Communism, but moderated over time. However Friedman did state in a 1995 interview {{that he is an}} anti-interventionist. He opposed the Gulf War and the Iraq War. In a spring 2006 interview, Friedman said that the USA's stature in the world had been eroded by the Iraq War, but that it might be improved if Iraq were to become a peaceful and independent country.|$|E
5|$|Millions {{turned out}} in major cities across Egypt on the 25th, {{especially}} in Cairo's Tahrir Square. In the beginning, tensions were high between the police and protesters with violence breaking out in Suez and Alexandria. The government took a <b>hard</b> <b>line,</b> using riot-control tactics, and shutting down communications; But by the 28th the protests were continuing and the police had retreated. The security role {{was taken over by}} the military, and from then on the situation remained almost entirely peaceful. As pressure rose on Mubarak, the scale of the protests continued to grow, especially on specially organized Friday rallies.|$|E

5|$|Smith had {{to conduct}} {{another set of}} {{surrender}} negotiations, that of the German armed forces, in May 1945. Smith met with {{the representatives of the}} German High Command (the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht), Colonel General Alfred Jodl and General-Admiral Hans-Georg von Friedeburg. Once again, Strong acted as an interpreter. Smith took a <b>hard</b> <b>line,</b> threatening that unless terms were accepted, the Allies would seal the front, thus forcing the remaining Germans {{into the hands of the}} Red Army, but he made some concessions regarding a ceasefire before the surrender came into effect. On May 7, Smith signed the surrender document, along with the French representative, Major General François Sevez, and the Soviet Susloparov.|$|E
5|$|The Cold War {{was a major}} political, {{economic}} and military endeavor for over four decades, but the confrontation between the two superpowers had decreased dramatically {{by the end of}} Reagan's presidency. The significance of Reagan's role in ending the Cold War has spurred contentious and opinionated debate. That Reagan played a role in contributing to the downfall of the Soviet Union is agreed, but the extent of this role is continuously debated, with many believing that Reagan's defense policies, economic policies, military policies and <b>hard</b> <b>line</b> rhetoric against the Soviet Union and Communism, as well as summits with General Secretary Gorbachev played a significant part in ending the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|The Kirk {{that had}} been {{established}} at the Reformation, had been largely united since the Declaration of the Covenant in 1638. In the period after the defeat at Dunbar, it became divided, partly {{in the search for}} scapegoats for defeat. Different factions and tendencies produced rival resolutions and protests, which gave their names to the two major parties as Resolutioners, who were willing to make an accommodation with royalism, and more <b>hard</b> <b>line</b> Protesters who wished to purge the Kirk of such associations. Subsequently, the divide between rival camps became almost irrevocable. After 1655 both groups appointed permanent agents in London.|$|E

5|$|U.S.-Soviet {{relations}} took a {{turn for}} the worse with the Soviet’s arrest of U.S. reporter Nicholas Daniloff, evidently for use as a bargaining chip in response to the August 30, 1986 arrest of suspected KGB agent Gennadiy Zakharov. Since Daniloff was not engaged in espionage, Matlock advised taking a <b>hard</b> <b>line</b> with the Soviets. While charges against Daniloff were dropped, a diplomatic row ensued, leading by the end of October, to the expulsion of 100 Soviets, including 80 suspected intelligence officers. The U.S. lost 10 diplomats from Embassy Moscow, along with all 260 of the Russian support staff.|$|E
5|$|After the {{execution}} of the King in January 1649, England was declared a commonwealth and the Scots declared his son king as Charles II. The English responded with an invasion and, after defeats for the Scots at Dunbar in 1650 and Worcester in 1651, the English occupied the country in 1652, declaring Scotland part of the Commonwealth. In the period after the defeat at Dunbar the Kirk became deeply divided, partly in the search for scapegoats for defeat. Different factions and tendencies produced rival resolutions and protests, which gave their names to the two major parties as the Resolutioners, who were willing to make an accommodation with royalism, and the more <b>hard</b> <b>line</b> Protesters who wished to purge the Kirk of such associations. Subsequently, the divide between rival camps became almost irrevocable. After 1655 both groups appointed permanent agents in London.|$|E
5|$|Mathias officially {{declared}} his candidacy for the Senate on February 10, 1968, calling for troop {{reductions in the}} Vietnam War, and identifying urban blight, racial discrimination, welfare reform, and improving public schools as major issues. As the campaign drew on, the two primary issues became the war and crime. Mathias argued that the extensive bombing campaigns in North Vietnam should be reduced, while Brewster had argued for increasing bombardment. Brewster adopted a <b>hard</b> <b>line</b> stance on law and order, while Mathias advocated addressing the precipitating causes of poverty and the low standard of living in urban ghettos. Campaign finances were also an issue, with controversy erupting over Brewster's receipt of $15,000 in campaign contributions from his Senate staff and their families. On November 5, 1968, Mathias was elected, garnering 48% of the vote to Brewster's 39% and perennial candidate George P. Mahoney's 13%.|$|E

5|$|Nixon {{had been}} a firm {{supporter}} of Kennedy in the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion and 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis; on taking office he stepped up covert operations against Cuba and its president, Fidel Castro. He maintained close relations with the Cuban-American exile community through his friend, Bebe Rebozo, who often suggested ways of irritating Castro. These activities concerned the Soviets and Cubans, who feared Nixon might attack Cuba and break the understanding between Kennedy and Khrushchev which had ended the missile crisis. In August 1970, the Soviets asked Nixon to reaffirm the understanding; despite his <b>hard</b> <b>line</b> against Castro, Nixon agreed. The process {{had not yet been}} completed when the Soviets began expanding their base at the Cuban port of Cienfuegos in October 1970. A minor confrontation ensued, which was concluded with an understanding that the Soviets would not use Cienfuegos for submarines bearing ballistic missiles. The final round of diplomatic notes, reaffirming the 1962 accord, were exchanged in November.|$|E
5|$|Speaker {{guided the}} 1920 Indians {{to their first}} World Series win. In a crucial late season game against the second-place White Sox, Speaker caught a <b>hard</b> <b>line</b> drive hit to deep right-center field by Shoeless Joe Jackson, ending the game. On a dead run, Speaker leaped with both feet off the ground, snaring the ball before {{crashing}} into a concrete wall. As he lay unconscious from the impact, Speaker still held the baseball. In the 1920 World Series against Brooklyn, Speaker hit an RBI triple in the deciding game, which the Indians won 3–0. Cleveland's 1920 season was also significant due {{to the death of}} Ray Chapman on August 17. Chapman died after being hit in the head by a pitch from Carl Mays. Chapman had been asked about retirement before the season, {{and he said that he}} wanted to help Speaker earn Cleveland's first World Series victory before thinking of retirement.|$|E
5|$|The government, {{represented}} by Lord Irwin, decided {{to negotiate with}} Gandhi. The Gandhi–Irwin Pact was signed in March 1931. The British Government agreed to free all political prisoners, {{in return for the}} suspension of the civil disobedience movement. According to the pact, Gandhi was invited to attend the Round Table Conference in London for discussions and as the sole representative of the Indian National Congress. The conference was a disappointment to Gandhi and the nationalists. Gandhi expected to discuss India's independence, while the British side focused on the Indian princes and Indian minorities rather than on a transfer of power. Lord Irwin's successor, Lord Willingdon, took a <b>hard</b> <b>line</b> against India as an independent nation, began a new campaign of controlling and subduing the nationalist movement. Gandhi was again arrested, and the government tried and failed to negate his influence by completely isolating him from his followers.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, the new US President Ronald Reagan {{pursued a}} <b>hard</b> <b>line</b> {{approach}} to Libya, erroneously claiming {{it to be}} puppet regime of the Soviet Union. In turn, Gaddafi played up his commercial relationship with the Soviets, visiting Moscow again in April 1981 and 1985, and in 1978 threatening to join the Warsaw Pact. The Soviets were nevertheless cautious of Gaddafi, seeing him as an unpredictable extremist. Beginning military exercises in the Gulf of Sirte – an area of sea that Libya claimed {{as a part of}} its territorial waters – in August 1981 the US shot down two Libyan Su-22 planes monitoring them. Closing down Libya's embassy in Washington, D.C., Reagan advised US companies operating in the country {{to reduce the number of}} American personnel stationed there. In March 1982, the US implemented an embargo of Libyan oil, and in January 1986 ordered all US companies to cease operating in the country, although several hundred workers remained when the Libyan government doubled their pay. Diplomatic relations also broke down with the UK, after Libyan diplomats were accused in the killing of Yvonne Fletcher, a British policewoman stationed outside their London embassy, in April 1984. In Spring 1986, the US Navy again began performing exercises in the Gulf of Sirte; the Libyan military retaliated, but failed as the US sank several Libyan ships.|$|E
5|$|Under the Commonwealth (1652–60), the {{universities}} saw {{an improvement in}} their funding, as they were given income from deaneries, defunct bishoprics and the excise, allowing the completion of buildings including the college in the High Street in Glasgow. They were still largely seen as training schools for clergy, and came {{under the control of}} the <b>hard</b> <b>line</b> Protesters, who were generally favoured by the regime because of their greater antipathy to royalism, with leading protester Patrick Gillespie being made Principal at Glasgow in 1652. After the Restoration there was a purge of Presbyterians from {{the universities}}, but most of the intellectual advances of the preceding period were preserved. The five Scottish universities recovered from the disruption of the civil war years and Restoration with a lecture-based curriculum that was able to embrace economics and science, offering a high-quality liberal education to the sons of the nobility and gentry. All saw the establishment or re-establishment of chairs of mathematics. Astronomy was facilitated by the building of observatories at St. Andrews and at King's and Marischal colleges in Aberdeen. Robert Sibbald was appointed as the first Professor of Medicine at Edinburgh and he co-founded the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh in 1681. These developments helped the universities to become major centres of medical education and would put Scotland at the forefront of Enlightenment thinking.|$|E
