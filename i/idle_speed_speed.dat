Firstly, with different statuses of vehicles on the road, for example moving with a constant <b>speed,</b> slowing down <b>speed,</b> <b>idling</b> <b>speed</b> or an increasing <b>speed,</b> there are different kinds of degree of contamination.

Also, based on the selecting principle of evaluation index, selected performance indicators for the emission factors, and taken them into consideration while establishing the traffic signal timing model based on relative evaluation index system. Then, an improved real-coded genetic algorithm to solve the traffic signal timing model is presented. Lastly, the three algorithms are proved by {{a great deal of}} numerical calculation.

5000|$|A vital {{component}} of all diesel engines is a mechanical or electronic governor which regulates the <b>idling</b> <b>speed</b> and maximum <b>speed</b> {{of the engine}} by controlling the rate of fuel delivery. Unlike Otto-cycle engines, incoming air is not throttled and a diesel engine without a governor cannot have a stable <b>idling</b> <b>speed</b> and can easily overspeed, resulting in its destruction. Mechanically governed fuel injection systems are driven by the engine's gear train. [...] These systems {{use a combination of}} springs and weights to control fuel delivery relative to both load and <b>speed.</b> [...] Modern electronically controlled diesel engines control fuel delivery by use of an electronic control module (ECM) or electronic control unit (ECU). The ECM/ECU receives an engine <b>speed</b> signal, as well as other operating parameters such as intake manifold pressure and fuel temperature, from a sensor and controls the amount of fuel and start of injection timing through actuators to maximise power and efficiency and minimise emissions. Controlling the timing of the start of injection of fuel into the cylinder is a key to minimizing emissions, and maximizing fuel economy (efficiency), of the engine. The timing is measured in degrees of crank angle of the piston before top dead centre. For example, if the ECM/ECU initiates fuel injection when the piston is 10° before TDC, the start of injection, or timing, is said to be 10° BTDC. Optimal timing will depend on the engine design as well as its <b>speed</b> and load, and is usually 4° BTDC in 1,350-6,000 HP, net, [...] "medium speed" [...] locomotive, marine and stationary diesel engines.|$|R

40|$|Fuel {{injection}} {{systems in}} modern diesel engines are {{designed and built}} to comply with very stringent environmental standards. They should also meet {{the highest level of}} fuel economy. Drivability, rapid response and easy and accurate control are a common demand. Changing the fuel characteristics could affect the performance of the fuel injection system. This study focuses on the evaluation of fuel spray characteristics of straight used cooking oil (SUCO) and its blends with petroleum diesel (PD) as a surrogate for pure PD. Used cooking oil blends have quite different physical properties from those of pure PD. Data for the lower heating value (LHV), density and viscosity were obtained from laboratory analysis. These data were merged with the physical and thermodynamic conditions of the diesel engine of interest to evaluate the dynamic behaviour of the fuel jet in 360 ° of crank rotation namely, the compression stroke, and the power stroke including the injection process. Engine operational conditions were calculated using a diesel dual thermodynamic cycle taking into account fuel injection adjustment at three different <b>speeds,</b> namely, <b>idle</b> <b>speed,</b> maximum torque <b>speed</b> and rated power <b>speed.</b> The results showed that fuel jet characteristics vary with SUCO content in the fuel blend. Two ranges of SUCO content in the blends were distinguished, 0 – 80 % SUCO content and 80 – 100 % SUCO content. Both showed a constant rate of change of jet characters per 10 % increase in SUCO content in the fuel blend. Lower rates of change of fuel characters were observed at 0 - 80 % SUCO content.
