5|$|Specter has {{received}} a 61% rating from the AFL-CIO. <b>He</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> cloture on the Employee Free Choice Act in 2007. In early 2009, Specter announced {{he would not be}} voting for cloture on the same act in the 111th Congress. After Specter switched parties, he changed his position on the issue again, and {{wrote a letter to the}} unions indicating he supported card check legislation.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 1920s, McNary {{supported}} the development of federal hydroelectric power dams, and in 1933, he introduced legislation {{that led to the}} building of the Grand Coulee and Bonneville dams on the Columbia, as public works projects. <b>He</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> the US joining the World Court in 1926. He favored buying more National Forest lands, reforestation, fire protection for forests via the Clarke–McNary Act, and farm support. Although vetoed by President Calvin Coolidge, the McNary–Haugen Farm Relief Bill was the forerunner of the farm legislation of the New Deal.|$|E
5|$|A {{supporter}} of American {{intervention in the}} Middle East, Lynch has made twelve trips to Iraq {{and a total of}} ten trips to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Part of the purpose of these visits was to ensure accountability in reconstruction projects. <b>He</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> the Iraq War authorization in 2002, against the Democratic House leadership, and later voted to continue funding the war. He has since supported Obama's drawdown of troops in Iraq throughout 2010 and 2011. He also supports Obama's renewal of the War in Afghanistan, and was the only Massachusetts representative to vote for funding for Obama's Afghanistan initiative. Lynch voted for increased foreign aid to Pakistan in 2009, but along with Oversight Chairman John F. Tierney, he pushed for strict oversight of the aid's distribution.|$|E

50|$|Raj is {{next and}} <b>he</b> <b>votes</b> <b>for</b> Fish, because <b>he</b> {{considers}} {{her to be}} a big threat. Nai then casts his <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Lori. There are 2 <b>votes</b> <b>for</b> Lori and 1 <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Fish. Leo is the last person to cast his vote. Marion informs him, that if <b>he</b> <b>votes</b> <b>for</b> Lori, then she will be going home. But if <b>he</b> decides to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Fish, then there will a tie. This means that the person with the lowest percentage weight-loss at this week’s weigh-in eliminated, and that is Fish. As Leo prepares to reveal his <b>vote,</b> <b>he</b> says “Both ladies sitting below the yellow line are capable of doing things that I even in all these weeks still can’t seem to do. There’s no lack of effort from either of them. Over and over again it’s just a game, so with that being said, my <b>vote</b> is <b>for</b> Solid Gold Fish.” The tie vote means that, the journey for Fish has come to an end.|$|R
5|$|In 1906, Roosevelt {{backed the}} Hepburn Bill, {{imposing}} railroad regulation. Many Republicans initially {{wanted nothing to}} do with the bill, and Senate Republican leader Nelson Aldrich entrusted management of the bill to Tillman. Aldrich hoped the outspoken South Carolinian would cause the defeat of the bill. To Aldrich's surprise, Tillman soberly and competently conducted the bill through much of the legislative process. Tillman withdrew from the bill (though <b>he</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> it) after Roosevelt got a provision for federal court review of agency decisions included, which Tillman opposed. The president and the southern senator ended on worse terms than before, but there was great public attention on the Hepburn Bill, and Tillman gained considerable respect for his role.|$|E
5|$|McGovern has {{a pro-choice}} record on abortion. He {{voted against the}} Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in October 2003 and the Unborn Victims of Violence Act in February 2004. He {{supports}} stem cell research, having {{voted in favor of}} the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act in 2005, 2007, and 2009. <b>He</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2007, which would have prevented employment {{discrimination on the basis of}} sexual orientation. He voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment, which would have constitutionally outlawed same-sex marriage, in 2004 and 2006, and co-sponsored the Respect for Marriage Act of 2009, which would allow the federal government to recognize same-sex marriages.|$|E
5|$|On two issues, women's suffrage, and the {{prohibition}} of alcohol, where picking the wrong side would have damaged his presidential prospects in 1920, he prospered by taking nuanced positions. As senator-elect, he indicated {{that he could not}} support votes for women until Ohio did. Increased support for suffrage there and among Senate Republicans meant that by the time Congress voted on the issue, Harding was a firm supporter. Harding, who drank, initially voted against banning alcohol. <b>He</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> the Eighteenth Amendment, which imposed Prohibition, after successfully moving to modify it by placing a time limit on ratification, which was expected to kill it. Once it was ratified anyway, Harding voted to override Wilson's veto of the Volstead Bill, which implemented the amendment, assuring the support of the Anti-Saloon League.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{incumbent}} Republican {{members of}} Congress announced {{they would not}} <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Trump. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham says <b>he</b> will not <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> either Trump or Clinton {{in the fall and}} urged other Republicans to [...] "un-endorse" [...] Trump. Illinois Senator Mark Kirk said he plans to write in a name, possibly David Petraeus or Colin Powell. New York Rep. Richard Hanna, who is retiring {{at the end of this}} term, was the first Republican to say <b>he</b> will <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Hillary Clinton. Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger said Trump [...] "for me is beginning to cross a lot of red lines in the unforgivable on politics" [...] and <b>he</b> will <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> a write-in candidate or not vote. Pennsylvania Rep. Charlie Dent said Trump crossed [...] "a bridge too far"; <b>he</b> plans to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> a write-in candidate. Virginia Rep. Scott Rigell, also retiring at the end of this term, said <b>he</b> will <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson.|$|R

5|$|Under the new constitution, each of Kentucky's {{legislative}} districts chose an elector, {{and these}} electors voted {{to choose the}} governor. Both Logan and Garrard were chosen as electors from their respective counties. On the first ballot, Logan received the votes of 21 electors, Garrard received 17, and Todd received 14. A lone elector cast his vote for John Brown, a Frankfort attorney who would soon be elected to the U.S. Senate. Some speculated that Garrard's moral character prevented him from voting for himself, but his political acumen prevented him from voting for a rival, so <b>he</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> Brown, who had not declared his candidacy. No proof exists {{that this was the}} case, however.|$|E
5|$|Various {{advocacy}} groups have given Biden scores or grades {{as to how}} well his votes align with the positions of each group. The American Civil Liberties Union gives him an 80 percent lifetime score, with a 91 percent score for the 110th Congress. Biden opposes drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and supports governmental funding to find new energy sources. Biden believes action must be taken on global warming. He co-sponsored the Sense of the Senate resolution calling on the United States {{to be a part}} of the United Nations climate negotiations and the Boxer-Sanders Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, the most stringent climate bill in the United States Senate. Biden was given an 85percent lifetime approval rating from AFL-CIO, and <b>he</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).|$|E
5|$|Hand {{had voted}} for Hoover in 1928, {{and he did}} so again in 1932; but in 1936, <b>he</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> the Democrats and Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a {{reaction}} to the economic and social turmoil that followed the Wall Street Crash of 1929. With the Great Depression setting in, Hand favored a policy of interventionist central government. He came to accept Frankfurter's view that redistribution of wealth was essential for economic recovery. Hoover resisted this approach, favoring individualism and free enterprise. Roosevelt, on the other hand, promised the voters a New Deal. They elected him on a platform of strong executive leadership and radical economic reform. Hand voted for Roosevelt again in 1940 and 1944, but he remained vigilant on the constitutional dangers of big government. Like others, including Walter Lippmann, he sensed the dictatorial potential of New Deal policies. He had no hesitation in condemning Roosevelt's 1937 bill to expand the Supreme Court and pack it with New Dealers.|$|E
50|$|He adamantly {{supported}} {{the implementation of}} free trade. <b>He</b> <b>voted</b> against renewal of the sugar duties, 9 Feb., and objected to the higher duty on East as opposed to West Indian produce, 4 May 1821. He opposed the timber duties. <b>He</b> <b>voted</b> silently <b>for</b> parliamentary reform, 25 Apr., 3 June, and spoke in its favour at the Westminster anniversary reform dinner, 23 May 1822. <b>He</b> again <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> criminal law reform, 4 June.|$|R
25|$|<b>He</b> has <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> {{establishing}} a nationwide AMBER alert system for missing children.|$|R
5000|$|Young has {{indicated}} an anti-gay right stance, and believes marriage should be {{between a man}} and a woman. He has compared gay relations to bulls having sex. <b>He</b> <b>voted</b> against protections <b>for</b> gay and lesbian people in the workplace. He has stated that, “I’ve hired a person of a different orientation,” continuing with, “That’s personal. ... I do believe in the Bible. Always have and always will. But hiring is different.” <b>He's</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> making gay adoptions illegal, and in 2009 voted against sexual orientation being enforced as a protected status against hate crimes.|$|R
5|$|Mason {{retained}} {{his interest}} in western affairs, hoping in vain to salvage the Ohio Company's land grant. He and Jefferson were among the few delegates to be told of George Rogers Clark's expedition to secure control of the lands north of the Ohio River. Mason and Jefferson secured legislation authorizing Governor Henry to defend against unspecified western enemies. The expedition was generally successful, and Mason received a report directly from Clark. Mason sought to remove differences between Virginia and other states, and although he felt the 1780 settlement of the boundary dispute with Pennsylvania, the Mason-Dixon line (not named for George Mason) was unfavorable to Virginia, <b>he</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> it enthusiastically. Also in 1780, Mason remarried, to Sarah Brent, from a nearby plantation, {{who had never been}} married and was 52 years old. It was a marriage of convenience, with the new bride able {{to take some of the}} burden of parenting Mason's many children off his hands.|$|E
5|$|The Junta {{suffered}} from internal {{conflicts between the}} conservatives (led by Cornelio Saavedra) and the liberals (led by Mariano Moreno). Azcuénaga was aligned with Moreno. Although he opposed {{the expansion of the}} Junta into the Junta Grande, <b>he</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> the proposal, perhaps under pressure of Saavedra. Mariano Moreno resigned in December, and all his supporters were forced to resign in May 1811. Azcuénaga was exiled to the Mendoza Province, and lost his military rank. His wife requested instead an exile to the closer Luján, which was declined. The Junta was replaced by the First Triumvirate. Azcuénaga still had a positive image among his peers, and the political change allowed his return and the restitution of his rank. However, a mistake with the documentation gave him only the rank of colonel; he could only retrieve his rank of Brigadier in 1814. He was appointed Governor intendant of Buenos Aires (ruling over the province, whereas the Triumvirate had a national authority).|$|E
5|$|Henry B. Payne (November 30, 1810September 9, 1896) was an American {{politician}} from Ohio. Moving to Ohio {{from his}} native New York in 1833, he quickly established himself in law and business while becoming a local leader in Democratic politics. After serving in the Ohio Senate, Payne was elected to a single term in the United States House of Representatives in 1874. In the House, he worked unsuccessfully for a compromise {{in the debate over}} whether all of the nation's currency should be backed by gold. He was defeated for reelection, but served on the Electoral Commission that convened in early 1877 to resolve the dispute over the results of the 1876 presidential election. He ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1880, but lost to Winfield Scott Hancock, who would go on to lose the general election to James A. Garfield. He was elected to the United States Senate in 1884. His election by the Ohio legislature was tainted with charges of bribery, but after investigation by the Senate, Payne was permitted to keep his seat. In the Senate, <b>he</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> moderate tariff reforms and against the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, but was otherwise a reliable Democratic vote. He did not run for reelection, and died in 1896.|$|E

While he {{described himself as}} [...] "still basically a conservative" [...] he also stated that he [...] "believed societies should be judged by how they treat their less fortunate".|$|R

5|$|Mariano Moreno {{had several}} {{contacts}} with groups seeking {{the removal of}} Cisneros, but was not strongly involved with the May Revolution, which considered {{the fall of the}} Junta of Seville a reason to depose the viceroy and create a local junta. At the time, Moreno was still loyal to Álzaga. He attended the May 22 open Cabildo, but according to the father of Vicente Fidel López and the father-in-law of Bartolomé Mitre (both direct witness) he stayed silent at one side and did not join the debate. <b>He</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> Saavedra's proposal: to remove viceroy Cisneros and replace him with a Junta. Manuel Hermenegildo Aguirre, captain of hussars, proposed that the Cabildo take the reins of government, with five men appointed as counselors, Moreno among them. However, nobody else voted for that proposal, and it {{was the only one that}} included him. Moreno felt betrayed when the Cabildo twisted the results of the open Cabildo and created a Junta that would be headed by Cisneros. He refused any further contacts with the revolutionaries and stayed home during the remaining events. The definitive members of the Junta came from a popular petition signed on May 25, which was given to the Cabildo. The reasons of Moreno's inclusion in the list are unclear, as with all other members of the Junta. A commonly accepted theory considers it to be a balance between Carlotists and Alzaguists.|$|E
