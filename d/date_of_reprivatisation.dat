50|$|In 1983 {{the first}} {{generation}} of the Computer Model for Feasibility Analysis and Reporting (COMFAR), a computation tool for financial analysis of investments, was released. Since then, this UNIDO software has been developed further, to also support the economic appraisal of projects.The Computer Model for Feasibility Analysis and Reporting (COMFAR III Expert) is intended as an aid in the analysis of investment projects. The main module of the program accepts financial and economic data, produces financial and economic statements and graphical displays and calculates measures of performance. Supplementary modules assist in the analytical process. Cost-benefit and value-added methods of economic analysis developed by UNIDO are included in the program and the methods of major international development institutions are accommodated. The program is applicable for the analysis of investment in new projects and expansion or rehabilitation of existing enterprises as, e.g., in the case <b>of</b> <b>reprivatisation</b> projects. For joint ventures, the financial perspective of each partner or class of shareholder can be developed. Analysis can be performed under a variety of assumptions concerning inflation, currency revaluation and price escalations.|$|R

Time to events (BCR, skeletal metastasis, or death) was calculated from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> prostatectomy or from the start of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy. Cause of death (prostate cancer or other cause) was determined by an independent monitor (JÖ and AL) blinded to the PET/CT results.|$|R

50|$|Most {{linguists}} such as Burrow {{argue that}} the strong similarity between the Avestan of the Gāthās—the oldest part of the Avesta—and the Vedic Sanskrit of the Rigveda pushes the <b>dating</b> <b>of</b> Zarathustra {{or at least the}} Gathas closer to the conventional Rigveda <b>dating</b> <b>of</b> 1500-1200 BCE, i.e. 1100 BCE, possibly earlier. Boyce concurs with a lower <b>date</b> <b>of</b> 1100 BCE and tentatively proposes an upper <b>date</b> <b>of</b> 1500 BCE. Gnoli dates the Gathas to around 1000 BCE, as does , with the caveat of a 400-year leeway on either side, i.e. between 1400 and 600 BCE. Therefore, the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the Avesta could also indicate the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the Rigveda.|$|R
