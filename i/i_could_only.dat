25|$|If all looting is wrong, as {{in theory}} it is, {{then they have}} been to blame: {{but there are times}} when the laws of nature assert {{themselves}} over the laws of civilization, and this was a case in point. You must remember that these men had just endured a long siege, that they had been bereft of everything they possessed and that they had hundreds of men, similarly destitute, who were dependent upon them. What was their position? Had they come to me and said, 'Give us money and food,' <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> have replied in the negative, or, at all events, to the effect that I could not feed their converts, and so they took the law into their own hands. It has been a case of poetical or primitive justice. But, granted that this sort of justice was admissible, I do not admit that the missionaries abused it. I have not heard of a single instance of a missionary looting for any purpose other than that of feeding themselves and their converts who were dependent on them.|$|E

500|$|At {{the age of}} 12, Hooper read a book {{entitled}} How to Make Film and Television and {{decided he wanted to}} become a director. For the next year Hooper researched filmmaking from publications such as On Camera by Harris Watts. Aged 13, he made his first film, entitled Runaway Dog, using a clockwork 16mm Bolex camera his uncle had given to him. Hooper said: [...] "The clockwork would run out after thirty seconds, so the maximum shot length was thirty seconds. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> afford a hundred feet of Kodachrome reversal film, which cost about twenty-five , and you had to send off for two weeks to be processed. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> make silent movies, because sound was too expensive and complicated." [...] He slowed down the frame rate of the camera so he could maximise what little film stock he had. Hooper classified the short, about a dog which kept running away from its owner, as a comedy, and filmed it on location in Oxfordshire.|$|E

Karan added, [...] "As I wrote the film, I realised that Yashvardhan Raichand is the backbone of the film and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> see one actor playing the role — Amitabh Bachchan."

Tougher Than Nails produced a Top 20 hit in its title track, followed by [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Only</b> Bring You Back", which peaked at number 50 and spent only eight weeks on the charts. This latter song was also his last charting single.

500|$|The makeup for the {{character}} of The Great Mutato was designed and created by special effects supervisor Tony Lindala. The Mutato mask went through several design iterations on paper, including 10–15 drawings and a color rendition. Constructed from latex, and containing an articulated second mouth, it cost $40,000 and took between five and seven hours to apply. In addition to the mask, Chris Owens wore contact lenses and dentures. Owens later recalled that [...] "the makeup had taken seven hours, and then I had sat around for three or four. And now I was going {{to sit in the}} dark, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> see out of one eye. They put a big contact lens in." [...] Initial versions of the costume were deemed [...] "too human looking" [...] and so a newer design was chosen.|$|E

500|$|The reunion album, titled simply Byrds, was {{released}} on March 7, 1973 to mixed reviews. [...] As a result, a planned tour {{in support of the}} album failed to materialize. [...] Among the album's shortcomings, critics made note of a lack of sonic unity and the absence of the Byrds' signature jangly guitar sound. [...] Nonetheless, the album managed to climb to number 20 on the Billboard Top LPs & Tapes chart and number 31 in the UK. [...] In the United States, the album became the band's highest charting LP of new material since 1965's Turn! Turn! Turn!, which had also been the last Byrds' album to feature Gene Clark as a full member. [...] Among the tracks included on the album were McGuinn's folk-flavored [...] "Sweet Mary", the Joni Mitchell cover [...] "For Free", a re-recording of Crosby's song [...] "Laughing" [...] (which had originally appeared on his 1971 solo album, If <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Only</b> Remember My Name), and a pair of Neil Young songs. [...] The album also featured the Gene Clark compositions [...] "Changing Heart" [...] and [...] "Full Circle", the latter of which had provided the reunion album with its working title and was subsequently released as a single, although it failed to chart.|$|E

We're just a few episode's into this show and I've already been enjoying their chemistry". She also praised Searle's performance saying, [...] "When Irina described cutting up Callum's body it was with an eerie coldness. She liked the man and he cared for her. Yet, once dead {{he was no longer}} an asset to her but a problem that needed to be disposed of, literally. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> imagine the parts of yourself you'd have to shut down {{to be able to take}} a hacksaw to someone you were fond of".
