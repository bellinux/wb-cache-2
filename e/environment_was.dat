5|$|Beilhart {{was born}} March 4, 1867 in Columbiana County, Ohio to a Lutheran {{father and a}} Mennonite mother. The ninth of 11 children, Beilhart {{was raised in the}} Lutheran church and his early home <b>environment</b> <b>was</b> {{strictly}} religious. Jacob did not receive {{much in the way of}} formal education. His father died when he was six or seven years old so Jacob attended only elementary school. At the age of 17, Beilhart went to work at his brother-in-law's harness shop in southern Ohio and, when they moved to Ottawa, Kansas, Jacob went with them.|$|E

5|$|During {{early years}} of colonisation, the {{surrounding}} trees were cut down and the river's gravel used in road making and construction of buildings. As the natural <b>environment</b> <b>was</b> removed, the banks were eroded and the riverbed gradually levelled as waterholes filled. By 1878 the river was noted to be a malodorous, black sewer rather than the sylvan stream of the 1830s.|$|E
5|$|His second book, It Doesn't Have To Be Like This, {{an outline}} of his views on the <b>environment,</b> <b>was</b> {{published}} in 1989, and he was regularly invited to high-profile events.

5|$|Shooting long {{scenes in}} a zero-g <b>environment</b> <b>was</b> a challenge. Eventually, the team {{decided to use}} computer-generated imagery for the spacewalk scenes and {{automotive}} robots to move Bullock's character for interior space station scenes. This meant that shots and blocking had to be planned well in advance for the robots to be programmed. It also made the production period much longer than expected. When the script was finalized, Cuarón assumed it would take about a year to complete the film, but it took {{four and a half}} years.|$|E

5|$|The depositional <b>environment</b> <b>was</b> a nearshore {{one where}} the {{seashore}} alternated between advance (transgression) and retreat (regression). At Zion, the limestones and fossils of the Timpoweap, Virgin Limestone, and Shnabkaib members of the Moenkopi Formation document transgressive episodes. Unlike the Timpoweap and Virgin Limestone members, the Shnabkaib contains abundant gypsum and interbedded mudstone resulting from deposition in a restricted marine environment with complex watertable fluctuations. Regressive, red bed layers separate the transgressive strata. Ripple marks, mud cracks, and thinly laminated bedding suggest that these intervening red shale and siltstone units were deposited in tidal flat and coastalplain environments.|$|E
5|$|A {{commission}} {{appointed by}} Governor Chiles published {{a report in}} 1995 stating that South Florida was unable to sustain its growth, and {{the deterioration of the}} <b>environment</b> <b>was</b> negatively affecting daily life for residents in South Florida. The environmental decline was predicted to harm tourism and commercial interests if no actions were taken to halt current trends. Results of an eight-year study that evaluated the C were submitted to the United States Congress in 1999. The report warned that if no action was taken the region would rapidly deteriorate. A strategy called the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was enacted to restore portions of the Everglades, Lake Okeechobee, the Caloosahatchee River, and Florida Bay to undo the damage of the past 50years. It would take 30years and cost $7.8billion to complete. Though the plan was passed into law in 2000, it has been compromised by politics and funding problems.|$|E

5|$|Although Beebe {{continued}} to use Nonsuch Island as his base of operations throughout the 1930s, {{with the onset of}} World War II in 1939 it was announced that the ferry linking Bermuda to New York would soon be making its final run, requiring Beebe and his team to hastily abandon their station there. Transportation to and from Bermuda resumed in 1940, and Beebe returned there in May 1941, but the <b>environment</b> <b>was</b> slowly being transformed due to the war. The large number of military ships made docking difficult, most of the island's reefs were being destroyed in order to construct an airfield, and the combination of construction activity and pollution made observation of the sea life impossible. Appalled by the destruction, Beebe finally rented his station at Nonsuch Island to a military contractor and returned to New York.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the storm}} {{affected}} several countries along its path, Waka left {{the most significant}} losses in Tonga, where it killed one person and wrought 104.2million paʻanga ($51.3million USD) in damage. Hundreds of structures, including 200 in the island's largest city, {{and much of the}} nation's agriculture were destroyed. Winds in excess of 185km/h (115mph) battered Vava'u, defoliating nearly every tree on the island. In addition to infrastructural and public losses, the <b>environment</b> <b>was</b> also severely affected; a native species of bat lost roughly 80% of its population {{due to the lack of}} fruit. Following the storm, Tonga requested international aid to cope with the scale of damage. Due to the severity of damage, the name Waka was later retired and replaced with Wiki. According to a study by Janet Franklin et al., storms similar in intensity to Waka, on average, strike Tonga once every 33years.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the system}} had a {{partially}} exposed low-level circulation center, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) as the depression {{was likely to}} intensify as it was situated over high sea surface temperatures and in a favorable environment. However, by September4, wind shear quickly increased and dislocated all of the convection associated with the depression {{from the center of}} circulation. This led to the JTWC canceling their TCFA as the <b>environment</b> <b>was</b> no longer favorable for development. The following day, the JTWC declared that the system had dissipated and was no longer a suspect area for tropical cyclone development as the system was virtually stationary off the coast of Vietnam. The JMA, on the other hand, continued to monitor the cyclone as a tropical depression. Although previously declaring that the system dissipated early on September6, the JTWC began monitoring the re-developing system later that day. Convective banding had reformed, wind shear had decreased and the cyclone had less interaction with land as it slowly moved further into the South China Sea. However, late on September8, both agencies declared that the depression had dissipated off the coast of Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the most}} {{satisfying}} moments in the Go series, the IGN and TouchArcade reviewers appreciated the game mechanic of determining how best to use a hack or drone to slip past enemies. The IGN reviewer found the game's puzzles somewhat harder than those of its predecessors, but was able to easily resolve them upon after taking brief breaks. The game's minimalism also led to some complications. Some of the solutions, he complained, were dependent on unintuitive player experimentation, such as realizing that the invisibility device {{also served as a}} projectile. Some of these visual cues were lost amidst the game's visual presentation. TouchArcade wondered whether the simplified <b>environment</b> <b>was</b> an aesthetic choice or the result of efforts to save on development costs. The GameSpot reviewer was disappointed to see an option for paid puzzle solutions in an otherwise short game about discovering the secret to a puzzle on one's own. Compared to the main series, in which the player may stake out a building at a distance, the experimentation in Deus Ex Go is limited to finding the right answer rather than finding multiple routes to solve the same problem.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} approach was {{the development of}} the ADS or armoured suit, which isolates the diver from the pressure at depth, at the cost of mechanical complexity and limited dexterity. The technology first became practicable in the middle 20th century. Isolation of the diver from the <b>environment</b> <b>was</b> taken further by the development of remotely operated underwater vehicles in the late 20th century, where the operator controls the ROV from the surface, and autonomous underwater vehicles, which dispense with an operator altogether. All of these modes are still in use and each has a range of applications where it has advantages over the others, though diving bells have largely been relegated to a means of transport for surface supplied divers. In some cases combinations are particularly effective, such as the simultaneous use of surface orientated or saturation surface supplied diving equipment and work or observation class remotely operated vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Believing {{their first}} {{attempts}} {{to be too}} derivative, the developers held brain storming sessions. During a session, they agreed that one of Asteroidss favorable elements was its wrapping effect. They felt a game that allowed the player to fly off the screen would be exciting, and decided to create a game world larger than the screen displayed. The game's <b>environment</b> <b>was</b> made longer than the screen, with the visible area scrolling horizontally. Expanding on the idea, they envisioned a version of Space Invaders rotated 90degrees. By changing the orientation of Space Invaders design, the ship moved up and down while flying horizontally. Large asteroids, an element from Asteroids, were then added to the game world, but were later removed because the staff felt it lacked enjoyment. Jarvis intended the screen to scroll only from left to right; fellow Williams employee Steve Ritchie, however, convinced him the game {{should be able to}} scroll in either direction.|$|E
