40|$|In {{this paper}} we treat {{numerical}} computation methods for linear programming. Started {{from the analysis}} of the efficiency and <b>defficiency</b> <b>of</b> the simplex procedure, we present new possibilities offered by the interior-point methods, which appears from practical necessity, from the need of efficient means of solving large-scale problems. We realise the implementation in Java of the Karmarkar’s method...|$|R

40|$|In this research, {{data mining}} and {{decision}} tree techniques were analyzed {{as well as}} the induction of rules to integrate their many algorithms into the database managing system (DBMS), PostgreSQL, due to the <b>defficiencies</b> <b>of</b> the free use tools avaialable. A mechanism to optimize the performance of the implemented algorithms was proposed with the purpose of taking advantage of the PostgreSQL. By means of an experiment, it was proven that the time response and results obtained are improved when the algorithms are integrated into the managing system...|$|R
40|$|The analogo-resistant mutants of yeast C. utilis {{have been}} {{received}} with high (by 10 to 20 times) {{content of the}} free lysine in the cellular pool {{as compared with the}} original strains. The mutants with blocked lysine katabolism on the early stages have been recevied. The positive influence of the mutation by the lysine katabolism on the content of the free lysine in the cells of the analogo-resistant mutants has been shown. The strains, containing lysine by 30 - 70 % more in the biomass, have been obtained. The obtained quantities of lysine of the mutants in the cellular protein, completely eliminate the <b>defficiency</b> <b>of</b> lysine of the plant producers, existing at present. The obtained mutants can by used in the industrial productionAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R

The article’s primary intention is to show {{how important it is to}} quickly gather precise data, to define the exact structure of the damage and the degree <b>of</b> <b>defficiency</b> <b>of</b> the capacities remaining. All this will serve to establish a priority list for the repair, reconstruction and construction of new facilities in agriculture and kindered primary activities...|$|R
