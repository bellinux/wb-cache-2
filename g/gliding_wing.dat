It is necessary to apply new materials and include appropriate production technologies in a shipbuilding process. This paper suggests some of the materials to be used for production of thinner components resulting in an overall lighter structure. Accordingly, appropriate surface treatment technology, shot-peening, is proposed to achieve a higher strength of critical structural elements. It is also shown that same technological process can improve fatigue strength of treated elements which is of great importance due to significant fatigue problem of considered structures...|$|E

40|$|AbstractHigh {{altitude}} air-launched autonomous {{underwater vehicle}} (AL-AUV) is a new anti-submarine field, which is designed on the Lockheed Martin’s high altitude anti-submarine warfare weapons concept (HAAWC) and conducts the basic aerodynamic feasibility {{in a series of}} wind tunnel trials. The AL-AUV is composed of a traditional torpedo-like AUV, an additional ex-range <b>gliding</b> <b>wings</b> unit and a descending parachute unit. In order to accurately and conveniently investigate the dynamic and static characteristic of high altitude AL-AUV, a simulation platform is established based on MATLAB/SIMULINK and an AUV 6 DOF (Degree of Freedom) dynamic model. Executing the simulation platform for different wing’s parameters and initial fixing angle, a set of AUV gliding data is generated. Analyzing the recorded simulation result, the velocity and pitch characteristics of AL-AUV deployed at varying wing areas and initial setting angle, the optimal wing area is selected for specific AUV model. Then the comparative simulations of AL-AUV with the selected wings are completed, which simulate the AUV gliding through idealized windless air environment and gliding with Dryden wind influence. The result indicates that the method of wing design and simulation with the simulation platform based on SIMULINK is accurately effective and suitable to be widely employed...|$|R

50|$|When a bird flaps, {{as opposed}} to <b>gliding,</b> its <b>wings</b> {{continue}} to develop lift as before, but the lift is rotated forward to provide thrust, which counteracts drag and increases its speed, which {{has the effect of}} also increasing lift to counteract its weight, allowing it to maintain height or to climb. Flapping involves two stages: the down-stroke, which provides the majority of the thrust, and the up-stroke, which can also (depending on the bird's wings) provide some thrust. At each up-stroke the wing is slightly folded inwards to reduce the energetic cost of flapping-wing flight. Birds change the angle of attack continuously within a flap, as well as with speed.|$|R

40|$|Many flying animals {{use both}} {{flapping}} and gliding flight {{as part of}} their routine behaviour. These two kinematic patterns impose conflicting requirements on wing design for aerodynamic efficiency and, in the absence of extreme morphing, wings cannot be optimised for both flight modes. In <b>gliding</b> flight, the <b>wing</b> experiences uniform incident flow and the optimal shape is a high aspect ratio wing with an elliptical planform. In flapping flight, on the other hand, the wing tip travels faster than the root, creating a spanwise velocity gradient. To compensate, the optimal wing shape should taper towards the tip (reducing the local chord) and/or twist from root to tip (reducing local angle of attack). We hypothesised that, if a bird is limited in its ability to morph its wings and adapt its wing shape to suit both flight modes, then a preference towards flapping flight optimization will be expected since this is the most energetically demanding flight mode. We tested this by studying a well-known flap-gliding species, the common swift, by measuring the wakes generated by two birds, one in gliding and one in flapping flight in a wind tunnel. We calculated span efficiency, the efficiency of lift production, and found that the flapping swift had consistently higher span efficiency than the gliding swift. This supports our hypothesis and suggests that even though swifts have been shown previously to increase their lift-to-drag ratio substantially when <b>gliding,</b> the <b>wing</b> morphology is tuned to be more aerodynamically efficient in generating lift during flapping. Since body drag can be assumed to be similar for both flapping and gliding, it follows that the higher total drag in flapping fligh...|$|R

50|$|As {{is true for}} any {{structure}} {{shaped by}} natural selection, bird anatomy has evolved to fit a particular species' behavior and lifestyle. For example, birds that live in dense forests and require high maneuverability and precise landing capabilities tend to have wing shapes and body plans that reduce stability to allow the execution of fast turns and sudden accelerations. Seabirds, on the other hand, tend to fly for extended periods in open air because land masses are distantly separated and floating {{on the surface of}} the water can be metabolically costly due to the temperature differential between air and sea water. As a result, large sea birds rely mostly on soaring flight because it allows these animals to achieve relatively continuous lift without the added metabolic cost of flapping their wings. Because birds fly at an angle relative to the wind during dynamic soaring, they must be able to achieve flight speeds greater than this head wind. Consequently, birds that rely on dynamic soaring tend to have high wing loadings and high aspect ratios. In other words, <b>gliding</b> birds have <b>wing</b> shapes that allow them to behave more like fixed wing aircraft and rely mostly on passive gliding. Albatrosses have the largest wingspan of any extant bird, evidence of their primary reliance on aerodynamic and slope soaring techniques to achieve their extremely long migration patterns.|$|R
40|$|We {{compared}} migrating {{behavior of}} Broad-winged Hawks (Buteo platypterus) at two sites along their migration corridor: Hawk Mountain Sanctuary in eastern Pennsylvania and the Kéköldi Indigenous Reserve in Limón, Costa Rica. We counted {{the number of}} times focal birds intermittently flapped their wings and recorded the general flight type (straight-line soaring and <b>gliding</b> on flexed <b>wings</b> versus circle-soaring on fully extended wings). We used a logistic model to evaluate which conditions were good for soaring by calculating the probability of occurrence or absence of wing flaps. Considering that even intermittent flapping is energetically more expensive than pure soaring and gliding flight, we restricted a second analysis to birds that flapped during observations, and used the number of flaps to evaluate factors influencing the cost of migration. Both the occurrence and extent of flapping were greater in Pennsylvania than in Costa Rica, and during periods of straight-line soaring and gliding flight compared with circle-soaring. At both sites, flapping was more likely during rainy weather and early and late in the day compared with the middle of the day. Birds in Costa Rica flew in larger flocks than those in Pennsylvania, and birds flying in large flocks flapped less than those flying alone or in smaller flocks. In Pennsylvania, but not in Costa Rica, the number of flaps was higher when skies were overcast than when skies were clear or partly cloudy. In Costa Rica, but not in Pennsylvania, flapping decreased as temperature increased. Our results indicate that birds migrating in large flocks do so more efficiently than those flying alone and in smaller flocks, and that overall, soaring conditions are better in Costa Rica than in Pennsylvania. We discuss how differences in instantaneous migration costs at the two sites may shift the species 2 ̆ 7 migration strategy from one of time minimization in Pennsylvania to one of energy minimization in Costa Rica...|$|R
50|$|The adult's plumage {{consists}} of dark grey-brown coloration on the upperparts, head and upper chest, {{with an occasional}} slightly lighter edging to these feathers. The body underparts are feathered white with sparse but conspicuous blackish-brown spotting. The underwing coverts are dark brown, with the remiges being pale streaked with black, overall imparting the wings of adults a dark look. The underside of the tail has similar barring as the remiges while the upperside is the same uniform brown as the back and upperwing coverts. The eyes of mature martial eagles are rich yellow, while the cere and large feet pale greenish and the talons black. Martial eagles have a short erectile crest, which is typically neither prominent nor flared (unlike that of the crowned eagle) and generally appears as an angular back to a seemingly flat head. This species often perches in a quite upright position, with its long wings completely covering the tail, causing it be described as “standing” rather than “sitting” on a branch when perched. In flight, martial eagles bear long broad wings with relatively narrow rounded tips that can appear pointed at times {{depending on how the}} eagle is holding its wings. It is capable of flexible beats with <b>gliding</b> on flattish <b>wings,</b> or slightly raised in a dihedral. This species often spends much {{a large portion of the}} day on the wing, more so than probably any other African eagles, and often at a great height. Juvenile martial eagles are conspicuously distinct in plumage with a pearly gray colour above with considerable white edging, as well as a speckled grey effect on crown and hind neck. The entire underside is conspicuously white. The wing coverts of juveniles are mottled grey-brown and white, with patterns of bars on primaries and tail that are similar to adult but lighter and greyer. In the 4th or 5th years, a very gradual increase to brownish feather speckling is noted but the back and crown remain a fairly pale grey. At this age, there may be increasing spots on throat and chest which coalesce into a gorget and some spots on abdomen may variably manifest as well. The eyes of juveniles are dark brown. This species reaches adult plumage by its seventh year with the transition to adult plumage happening quite rapidly after many years in a little-changing juvenile plumage.|$|R
