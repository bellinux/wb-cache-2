40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{construct}} a plausible theory of experience-based welfare, Wayne Sumner imposes two requirements on the relevant kind of experience: the <b>information</b> <b>requirement</b> and the autonomy requirement. I argue that both requirements are problematic. First, I argue (very briefly) that a well-know case like ‘the deceived businessman’ need not support the <b>information</b> <b>requirement</b> as Sumner believes. Second, I introduce a case designed to cast further doubt on the <b>information</b> <b>requirement.</b> Third, I attend to a shortcoming in Sumner’s theory of welfare, namely that it is unclear which of later and informed assessments are {{to be treated as}} authoritative {{when it comes to the}} evaluation of a person’s welfare. Finally, I suggest that, in combination with ‘welfarism’ (to which Sumner subscribes, and which has it that welfare is all that matters from a moral viewpoint), the <b>information</b> <b>requirement</b> entail morally troublesome conclusions: e. g. the conclusion that, from a moral point of view, we should, other things being equal, only to be concerned with the alternative that makes one person slightly better off in respect of welfare instead of also being morally concerned with the alternative that makes one person very happy...|$|R
40|$|Supporting {{competitive}} {{business analysis}} of financial reports through the automated {{analysis and interpretation}} of their natural language sections, presents specific challenges including {{information that can be}} ambiguous, camouflaged, or tacitly hidden within the narrative. These sections present terminology and structural challenges for information extraction that require the application of linguistic and heuristic based domain modelling to identify the <b>information</b> <b>requirement.</b> This thesis investigates a modelling approach that incrementally builds the business analysts <b>information</b> <b>requirement</b> as a series of Semantic Paths grounded in domain linguistic and user heuristics. A Competitive Analysis Ontology (CAO) is defined to provide semantic representation of the <b>information</b> <b>requirement</b> necessary to drive linguistic analysis and information extraction. The evaluation of the CAO within the financial sub-domain of competitive analysis is investigated, through the development of the Analyst Work Bench (AWB), is presented. The AWB linguistically analyses a Form 10 -Q 2 ̆ 7 s disclosure sections, automatically populates the CAO and provides the analyst 2 ̆ 7 s <b>information</b> <b>requirement.</b> The AWB leverages the CAO Semantic Paths for information search and extraction capability, to support an analyst perform a competitive analysis, with reduced manual effort.

2500|$|Most analysts view BPR and IT as irrevocably linked.

The IT infrastructure and BPR are interdependent in the sense that deciding the <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> for the new business processes determines the IT infrastructure constituents, and a recognition of IT capabilities provides alternatives for BPR. Building a responsive IT infrastructure is highly dependent on an appropriate determination of business process information needs.

2500|$|Shared {{situation}} awareness {{can be defined}} as [...] "the degree to which team members possess the same SA on shared SA requirements" [...] (Endsley & Jones, 1997, p.47; 2001, p.48). As implied by this definition, there are <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> that are relevant to multiple team members. A major part of teamwork involves the area where these SA requirements overlap—the shared SA requirements that exist {{as a function of the}} essential interdependency of the team members. In a poorly functioning team, two or more members may have different assessments on these shared SA requirements and thus behave in an uncoordinated or even counter-productive fashion. Yet in a smoothly functioning team, each team member shares a common understanding of what is happening on those SA elements that are common—shared SA. Thus, shared SA refers to the overlap between the SA requirements of the team members, as presented in Figure 3. As depicted by the clear areas of the figure, not all information needs to be shared. Clearly, each team member is aware of much that is not pertinent to the others on the team. Sharing every detail of each person's job would only create a great deal of [...] "noise" [...] to sort through to get needed information. [...] It is only that information which is relevant to the SA requirements of each team member that is needed.|$|E
