With {{the advent}} of two new techniques, collisionally induced dissociative {{ionization}} and neutralization reionization mass spectrometry, {{it is possible to}} investigate the structure and stability of neutrals as well as ions. Fragmentation mechanisms of alkyl phenyl ethers. The metastable fragmentation mechanisms of alkyl phenyl ethers and methyl pentyl ethers have been thoroughly investigated. It has been shown that the formation of an ion/radical complex is the key step in the metastable loss of olefin from alkyl phenyl ethers and loss of methanol from methyl pentyl ethers. The alkyl moiety in an ion/radical complex between a primary alkyl cation and a phenoxy radical undergoes a rate determining isomerization to a secondary or tertiary alkyl cation at an energy above the dissociation threshold for the resulting complex. A β(H+) is then immediately transferred from the alkyl cation to the phenoxy radical followed by dissociation to products. Assigning structures to isomeric (C 5,H+. ions. The ten (C 5,H+. isomers may be distinguished based on their heats of formation, low ionizing electron energy mass spectra and charge stripping mass spectra. The fragmentation mechanisms for H 2 O loss from 1 -pentanol and HCl loss from 1 -chloropentane were determined the aid of deuterium labelling and identification of the product (C 5,H+. ions.
