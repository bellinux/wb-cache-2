40|$|Certain states {{resort to}} {{diplomatic}} assurances to facilitate and legitimise {{the removal of}} non-nationals to third states with dubious human rights records. Typically, these removals involve two countries where human rights are conceived of in different ways and institutionalised to different degrees. Given their practical importance in the U. S. programme of "extraordinary renditions" {{as part of the}} ongoing "war on terror", diplomatic assurances have definitely moved into the domain of high politics. Earlier, such assurances were mainly seen as a migration control tool. Now, cases are reported where they provided a prelude to the interrogation, or incapacitation of perceived enemies in less protective jurisdictions. In this working paper, I argue that the combination of diplomatic assurances and rendition represent a contemporary form of ban. Their main function is to perform a double move: to assure the rendering community of its own faithfulness to human rights law, while the captive is given to human rights law in its withdrawal. This argument is developed in three main steps. First, I will explore the effects of diplomatic assurances on the international law of human rights. In Section 2, I shall demonstrate that a specific <b>diplomatic</b> <b>assurance</b> constitutes an agreement to disagree on the precise content of the torture prohibition in international human rights law. Section 3 explains why diplomatic assurances must be regarded as treaties under international law. In Section 4, I explore the uneasy relationship between diplomatic assurances and multilateral human rights instruments, with treaty law unable to reduce ambiguity. Second, I will attempt to explain the structures of which diplomatic assurances form part, and show how such assurances deny the articulation of human rights violations on multiple levels: by courts, by the captive, by the monitoring diplomat, and by the norm itself. Section 5 will be devoted to this task. Finally, in the last step, I will argue that the silence thus produced is not accidental, but must be seen {{as an integral part of}} the productivity of human rights law in a system of nation-states...|$|E
40|$|The {{practice}} of so-called diplomatic guarantees in recent international law The {{aim of this}} thesis is to analyze the {{practice of}} so-called <b>diplomatic</b> <b>assurances</b> (guarantees) in contemporary international law and its possible impact on existing obligations of States related {{to the protection of}} human rights, especially in relation to the ban on torture. <b>Diplomatic</b> <b>assurances</b> enable a transfer of an individual from one State to another. They include an undertaking of the State receiving an individual that he or she will be treated in accordance with the conditions set by the sending State, i. e. generally in accordance with the human rights obligations. However, it has recently received a great deal of public attention due to a number of suspicious returns of alleged terror suspects into the countries with poor human rights record including a record of torture. Consequently, the opinion criticizing the reliance on <b>diplomatic</b> <b>assurances</b> evolved describing <b>diplomatic</b> <b>assurances</b> as a tool how to circumvent current obligations of States under international human rights law.

40|$|Inspired by the {{recently}} concluded litigation seeking to deport the radical Islamic preacher Abu Qatada from the UK to Jordan, this paper aims at examining the 2012 {{judgment of the}} ECtHR {{by focusing on the}} question under which circumstances a deportation with <b>diplomatic</b> <b>assurances</b> (DWA) may be permissible under the European Convention on Human Rights. Relevant background information will be provided concerning the interplay of the use of the DWA policy and the European Convention on Human Rights as well as concerning the particular circumstances that led to the ECtHR’s ruling in Abu Qatada. In the following analysis of the judgment, the focus will be on the interplay of the DWA policy and the European Convention on Human Rights with special regard to art 3 and art 6 of the Convention. Finally, the impact of this judgment on the future jurisprudence and the DWA policy will be shown. In the light of this judgment, it will be argued that the counter terrorism means of deporting a non-national terrorist suspect with <b>diplomatic</b> <b>assurances</b> seems to be compatible with the Convention if the <b>diplomatic</b> <b>assurances</b> given guarantee a sufficient protection of the human rights of the transferee, which due to the uncertain effects of the DWA policy, still has to be decided on a case-by-case basis...|$|R
40|$|In this master’s thesis, I analyse the {{legality}} discourse of <b>diplomatic</b> <b>assurances</b> {{in the cases}} of expulsion to torture. The reason for this study is that there are controversies in International Human Rights Law surrounding the permissibility of creating and using <b>diplomatic</b> <b>assurances</b> in torture-expulsion cases. The ongoing discussion about the validity of assurances {{in the cases of}} expulsion to torture could be divided into two conflicting categories: oppositional approach and optimistic approach. What both approaches {{have in common is that}} they argue that there is a pertinent need to evaluate if there are substantial grounds to believe that the returnee would be in danger of being subjected to torture. This evaluation process is known as torture risk assessment, which is inherent within the application of the principle of non-refoulement to torture, as a jus cogens norm of International Law. The jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, in the landmark case of Othman (Abu Qatada) v. the United Kingdom, shows that by creating strong <b>diplomatic</b> <b>assurances,</b> which for example, encompass effective post-return monitoring and enforcement mechanisms, the real risk of torture shall be removed and the individual could be returned safely. This strengthening of <b>diplomatic</b> <b>assurances</b> in the cases of expulsion to torture is a practical response to compensate for the ambiguity inherent in different aspects of the concept of torture. This ambiguity includes uncertainties about what torture is and when and how it might happen. This is the main reason for the need to conduct torture risk assessment and to formulate effective and enforceable assurances in the cases of expulsion to torture. Based on this, assurances should be seen as the manifestation of States’ intent to create binding international obligations in direct connection and with reference to their obligations under the principle of non-refoulement to torture...|$|R

40|$|In {{the course}} of the 'War on Terrorism' the United States has been {{permitted}} to use Shannon Airport, Ireland and Irish airspace for the purposes of refuelling, stop over, and fly over. Suspicion abounds that the United States has exercised these rights in relation to planes involved in 'extraordinary rendition' and, as a result, that Ireland is in breach of its obligation of non-refoulement under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The Irish Government claims that it has received comprehensive and unequivocal <b>Diplomatic</b> <b>Assurances</b> from the United States that no persons have been, are being, or will be 'rendered' through Irish airspace and Shannon Airport and that these Assurances are sufficient to fulfill Ireland's Article 3 obligations, should they arise. This essay, forthcoming in the Irish Yearbook of International Law, examines two fundamental questions that arise in relation to this issue: (1) is Ireland's jurisdiction engaged as a 'transit state' under Article 1 of the ECHR, and (2) if jurisdiction is engaged, could the <b>Diplomatic</b> <b>Assurances</b> provided be sufficient for Article 3 purposes.

This Article introduces the subject by describing a complaint filed {{in a lawsuit}} by Canadian citizen Maher Arar. The United States sent Arar from John F. Kennedy airport to Syria, where he was tortured and was held in a grave-sized cell for nearly a year. Arar alleges that his transfer violated the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“CAT”). Arar’s lawsuit may be dismissed before the court reaches the substance of his claims. But much of the evidence needed to evaluate his charges is already {{a matter of public}} record. This Article attempts to compile that evidence, which has been reported in hundreds of different sources, into single coherent account for the first time. This factual information, important in its own right, is also crucial in addressing the Bush administration’s most common defense of rendition: the argument that before every rendition it obtains <b>diplomatic</b> <b>assurances</b> that a suspect will not be tortured, and these are enough to reduce the odds of torture to under 50 percent and comply with Article 3 of the CAT. Article 3 requires the administration to consider all evidence relevant to the danger of torture before transferring a prisoner.

50|$|Though De Witt {{tended to}} believe the {{repeated}} <b>diplomatic</b> <b>assurances</b> by the French and English {{that they had no}} invasion in mind, many Dutch politicians and military men interpreted the French diplomatic activities in the German principalities, the preparing of the English Navy, and the raising of large armies as sure signs of an imminent war. On 25 February 1672, William III, despite his youth, was appointed Captain-General of the confederate Dutch army. Factional strife and uncertainty about the French strategy prevented establishing a strong field army; most of the 83,000 troops (70,700 infantry and 12,710 cavalry in June 1672) were assigned to the fortresses. Whereas the Dutch Republic was thus ill-prepared for a land campaign, it had a more favourable situation at sea, even though the States General decided to limit the naval budget to 4,776,248 guilders (down from an original projected budget of 7,893,992 guilders) in order not to provoke the English.|$|R

Rather, it is the growing use of these agreements as part of extradition or deportation proceedings or as part of irregular transfers such as extraordinary renditions in order to reduce state obligations under the human rights framework. The heavy reliance on these agreements by the United Kingdom, particularly after 9 / 11, illustrates aptly the changing approach towards national security...|$|R

The private troubles these impure victims are experiencing are the loss of many of the rights most of us enjoy (for example, the right to liberty and the right to a fair trial).

40|$|Resumé Aj The {{purpose of}} my thesis {{is to provide}} a {{detailed}} view of prohibition of torture in contemporary practice of States. De iure is the absolute prohibition of torture unquestionable. However situation de facto is more complicated. States are very inventive in finding ways of circumventing this absolute prohibition. Their justification for circumventing the prohibition of torture may be called various things, such as <b>diplomatic</b> <b>assurances,</b> extraordinary rendition, interpretation of the definition of torture, national security, etc. Due to the limited scope of this work, I have selected the approaches of those States, which I find most worrisome and I will address them by presenting the practice of these individual States. This thesis has focused on an approach of certain European States, USA and Israel in their attempts to circumvent the absolute prohibition of torture. All examples support the topic of this thesis, however in different contexts. The thesis is composed of three core chapters. Chapter One deals with the legal status of the prohibition of torture. Chapter Two affirms the absolute prohibition of torture by case - law of ECtHR in cases Chahal v UK and Saadi v Italy. Chapter Three is subdivided into three parts. Part one reveals disturbing willingness of German courts as well as German [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In December 2001, the Swedish {{television}} programme “Kalla Fakta” uncovered {{the story of}} Ahmed Agiza and Muhammed El Zari, who after having been denied asylum in Sweden, were arrested {{by the police and}} deported in haste to Egypt. The two men were suspected of terrorist activities and even though Egypt was well-known to mistreat political opponents in general, and alleged Islamic terrorists in particular, the Swedish government decided to have them transferred. Both Agiza and El Zari later claimed that they were tortured in Egypt. The disclosure resulted in a massive outcry and the Swedish government were heavily criticised by a great number of both domestic and international actors for having violated its international law obligations and Agiza’s and El Zari’s human rights. Sweden, on the other hand, claimed that it had done whatever one could possibly require to ensure that the men were treated correctly, while also making sure that its national security was protected. This claim sheds a light on an old conflict that has been reinforced by the emerge of the globalised threat from terrorism and the violent and repressive responses towards it; namely, how to at once respect state security and human rights. The attacks of 9 / 11 and the “Global War on Terrorism” (the GWoT) have created an atmosphere where this conflict has increased to a level so that it now seems unsolvable and where the proponents of each perspective seem to have less and less understanding for the arguments of the opponent. The main argument of many governments, as well as many others, is that human rights and democracy can only be ensured and protected by states and that this requires that threats against the states security have to be eliminated. The human rights advocates, on the contrary, claim that fundamental institutions such as democracy, {{the rule of law and}} human rights cannot be protected by the undermining of the same. This dissertation focuses on the use of <b>diplomatic</b> <b>assurances,</b> a method where one state assures another state that they will refrain from torturing a returnee upon apprehension, and how the systematic use of such a method could undermine the principle of non-refoulement. The main objective is to discuss if and how <b>diplomatic</b> <b>assurances,</b> as being part of the Global War on Terrorism, might create a parallel legal sphere for alleged terrorist in which they are denied fundamental human rights. To do this, I contextualise the issue in a wider political discussion, claiming that one of the major reasons for this development is the general de-legitimisation of opposing political apprehensions as being non-political, and illustrating this with the securitisation (de-politicisation) of terrorism. I argue that by labelling people as terrorist, they are both denied access to the political sphere and de-humanised. The enduring answer on how to meet the terrorist threat is, according to me, not to wage a war but to widen the scope of our understanding of the political...|$|R
40|$|In Saadi v. Italy, the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) {{unanimously}} {{reaffirmed the}} absolute {{character of the}} prohibition of torture and inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment provided by article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). In the case at issue, the ECtHR held that {{the decision of the}} Italian government to deport a suspected terrorist to Tunisia — where he would have faced a “real risk” of torture — would have resulted in a violation of article 3 ECHR. This note presents the facts surrounding the case and analyzes the main issues addressed by the decision, with reference to the arguments presented by the parties and interveners before the Court. Despite the express prohibition in article 15 (2) of the ECHR of any derogation to article 3, the Court’s decision is, nonetheless, of major importance in light of the claims advanced by several states since September 2001 that, in the effort to provide a more secure environment for citizens and to fight international terrorism, the protection of some fundamental rights should be balanced against national security concerns. The Court rejected these claims and strongly reaffirmed the principle that no circumstance, including the threat of terrorism, can justify exposing an individual to the risk of serious human rights mistreatments. The principles reaffirmed in Saadi have recently found application in Ben Khemais v. Italy, where the ECtHR addressed in further detail the persuasiveness of <b>diplomatic</b> <b>assurances</b> when ascertaining whether there is a real risk of ill-treatment in the receiving country...|$|R
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Since the 9 / 11 {{terrorist}} attacks, the United States has transferred {{close to}} a hundred individuals suspected of terrorism to foreign jurisdictions through {{a process known as}} extraordinary rendition. This is an infamous program that allows for the transfer of individuals to a foreign jurisdiction for interrogation, detention, or trial. While the use of extraordinary rendition attracts widespread controversy regarding its use and legality, it remains a vital tool for combating international terrorism. Evidence in this thesis lends support to extraordinary rendition program, but recognizes that while the program strengthens the country’s ability to gather vital intelligence to combat terrorism, there are methods to improve the program. The extraordinary rendition program requires an assessment of the totality of circumstances before a extraordinary rendition is permitted; reliance on <b>diplomatic</b> <b>assurances</b> from countries that hold a good human rights record; and subsequent monitoring of individuals rendered to foreign states to ensure that transfers comply with U. S. and international law. Evidence suggests that extraordinary rendition aids in the ability to gather sensitive intelligence and serves as a gathering tool used by American presidents to preserve freedom and peace; however, in the eyes of critics, this program represents a perversely autonomous and un-American legal maneuver that avoids due process. This thesis seeks to discuss common misconceptions associated with the extraordinary rendition program and identify the major points of controversy. The first part explores the history of the extraordinary rendition program and provides an understanding of its roots and procedures. The second part, discusses the executive branch’s attempts to conduct extraordinary renditions morally and responsibly, and examines the legal oversight and accountability gaps surrounding the program. Part three identifies the line of authority empowering the President to conduct extraordinary renditions. It also outlines the struggle of the legislative, judicial and executive branches to strengthen the extraordinary rendition program’s compliance with the rule of law by increasing oversight and accountability. Finally, Part four discusses the future of the extraordinary rendition program. The discussion presents possible solutions to correct oversight and accountability problems and suggests a multi-faceted approach that raises the bar for extraordinary renditions, thereby closing the oversight and accountability gaps...|$|R
40|$|The {{practice}} of rendition - the involuntary transfer {{of an individual}} across borders without recourse to extradition or deportation proceedings - is not new. Indeed, the practice {{has been used by}} governments for more than a century. Famous renditions include that of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann from Argentina to Israel, and terrorist Carlos “the Jackal” (Ilich Ramirez Sanchez) from Sudan to France. Although such renditions have been controversial in human rights circles, they have been celebrated by many as crucial in the fight against impunity for grave crimes and are sometimes called “rendition to justice. ” The administration of former U. S. President George W. Bush was criticized for the new {{practice of}} “extraordinary rendition” - the transfer of suspects to countries known for the systematic use of torture. U. S. officials at the time defended the practice, relying on justifications developed to support “rendition to justice” and arguing that the practice was legal. Despite these justifications, international human rights bodies and intergovernmental bodies have determined that the extraordinary form of rendition is unlawful under human rights law. Although individuals have faced significant legal hurdles in fighting the practice in the U. S. legal system (most prominently {{in the form of the}} state secrets doctrine), there is little doubt among international law experts that extraordinary rendition is prohibited. Despite this clear consensus, there is no similar agreement concerning the practice of informal transfers - renditions of the non-“extraordinary” kind - more generally in the context of counter-terrorism efforts. This article fills the void in the literature by examining the legal norms governing such transfers and setting out a minimum standard that must be upheld whenever a state transfers an individual. As a threshold matter, formal processes for transfer may not be intentionally bypassed and the transferring state must have a valid legal basis for apprehending the individual in contemplation of transfer. Substantive rules protect individuals against transfer to a real risk of: torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment; persecution; enforced disappearance; or arbitrary deprivation of life. Procedural rules guarantee the individual the ability to challenge the basis for his or her apprehension/detention in advance of transfer before an independent decision-maker on the grounds provided for in international law. Where <b>diplomatic</b> <b>assurances</b> are used, they must be accompanied by rigorous safeguards including judicial review and effective post-return monitoring by the transferring state...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{lies at the}} {{junction}} of migration control and refugee protection. As asylum is a migration-related matter, {{it can be difficult}} for States to dissociate it from the fight against irregular immigration. Asylum, as a measure for protecting refugees and other persons in need of international protection, may thus easily come into conflict with policies and practices derived from strict border control considerations. This thesis concentrates upon this tension and aims, primarily, to investigate - with a specific focus on the European Union (EU) geographical context - whether the implementation of bilateral agreements linked to the readmission of irregular migrants can hamper refugees’ access to protection, understood here as the combination of the right to non-refoulement and an individual’s right to have access to asylum procedures and effective remedies before return. The material content and the normative scope of these protection standards is thus analysed through the lens of international refugee and human rights law and in respect of the traditional rules of treaty interpretation. The central objective of this thesis is to develop the concept of agreements linked to readmission by broadening – to my knowledge, for the first time - the scope of legal analysis to the multifaceted framework of bilateral cooperation arrangements connected to the readmission of irregular migrants from the EU to third countries of origin or transit. This encompasses written accords employed to facilitate the forced return of undocumented migrants from the territory of an EU Member State (standard readmission agreements and <b>diplomatic</b> <b>assurances</b> on the fair and humane treatment of the deportee, especially if formalized within MoUs), and those agreements for technical and police cooperation that are de facto utilized by EU Member States to divert migrants back to the ports of departure before they arrive to the destination country. In order to fully understand the real impact of bilateral agreements linked to readmission on refugee rights, it is necessary to acknowledge that the study of legal texts alone will not suffice in gaining a sufficiently comprehensive approach. Rather, equal attention has also to be accorded to the implementation of the law, and, as a result, a number of case studies have been incorporated as an integral element of the methodological framework. This thesis concludes that the text of agreements linked to readmission does not seem to raise per se issues of incompatibility with core refugee rights. However, in situations of informal border controls, massive arrivals, public emergency, and pre-arrival maritime interceptions, the enforcement of these bilateral agreements can de facto hamper refugees’ access to protection. Therefore, this thesis will make a number of recommendations as a platform for further discussion among legal scholars and policy-makers...|$|R

40|$|The interwar period {{represents}} {{an era of}} emerging growth and maturity in Australian foreign and defence relations, with a distinct focus shift from Imperial to regional matters. However, this expression of independent policy has been largely overlooked in the existing literature. Rather, Australian policy makers of this era have been framed as disinterested in policy making, lacking direction and preferring ‘to deal with the world one step removed through Whitehall’. Such interpretations have overlooked significant policy changes throughout this period, painting Australia as a timid and naïve nation, content to follow Britain’s every policy and demand. This article will challenge such views, drawing upon a recent growth in literature that supports the notion of growing assertiveness in Australian foreign and defence policy throughout the 1920 s and 1930 s. In doing so, this article will seek to redefine the interwar image of Australia. This will be achieved through an examination of Australia’s response to the increasingly doubtful <b>diplomatic</b> and security <b>assurances</b> it received from Britain throughout the 1920 s and 1930 s.

50|$|The Battle of Gallipoli {{occurred}} on 29 May 1416 between {{a squadron of}} the Venetian navy and the fleet of the Ottoman Empire off the Ottoman naval base of Gallipoli. The battle was the main episode of a brief conflict between the two powers, resulting from an Ottoman raid against Venetian possessions in the Aegean Sea in late 1415 and early 1416. The Venetian fleet, under Pietro Loredan, was charged with transporting Venetian envoys to the Sultan, but was authorized to attack if the Ottomans refused to negotiate. The subsequent events are known chiefly from a letter written by Loredan after the battle. The Ottomans exchanged fire with the Venetian ships {{as soon as the}} Venetian fleet approached Gallipoli, forcing the Venetians to withdraw.

Although a crushing Venetian victory, which confirmed Venetian naval superiority in the Aegean Sea for the next few decades, the settlement of the conflict was delayed until a peace treaty was signed in 1419.|$|R
40|$|This book is {{concerned}} with the subject of anti-terrorism laws and their impact on the rights of refugees and asylum seekers. In particular, it looks at the compatibility of anti-terrorism laws with international human rights law instruments. Over the last decade international terrorism and the subsequent anti-terrorism laws have created insecurities both for States and individuals and, as a result, have become important issues both internationally and nationally. This book critically evaluates these topical subject areas, which States are frequently reluctant to divulge information on details due to their political nature and the sensitive security-centered information they entail. Contained herein is a comparative study of law and policy, which attempt to fill gaps in current analysis in the literature. I argue that the recent anti-terrorism and asylum law has had a dire impact on the legal rights of asylum seekers. More specifically, the core international human rights standards that are central to the integrity of World War II asylum law have become weakened and to a significant extent even perverted by special criminal law responses to national security and terrorist threats after 9 / 11 by the a number of Western States. While there is a wide spectrum of anti-terrorism laws, there are also a number of safeguards and rights provided by international human rights law, instruments designed to provide legal protection for individuals. Some states - the U. S., the U. K., and Australia - have chosen to disregard the legal protections they are obliged to uphold, arguing that the current security climate justifies the exceptional nature of such apparently negative action. Apart from the politics of security concerns, international relations and media priorities contribute to the moulding of laws and policies. This has been particularly the case for the current treatment of asylum seekers. Most of the anti-terrorism laws and policies impact on the treatment and rights of non-nationals and immigrants, particularly on those seeking protection either as refugees or asylum seekers. This impact can be seen in two spheres, one within context of immigration control - including asylum determination processes - and another within the judicial procedures involved when asylum seekers are suspected of being a threat to national security and/or a terrorist. The measures that will be focused are detention; restriction of movement and exclusion. Chapter One examines why immigrants seeking protection are considered threatening to the host State and how policies are moulded by this idea. Historical events, international law and relations, foreign policy and domestic politics are all examined. This chapter emphasises and explains how the nexus of territorial security and the movement of persons and terrorism have changed in nature since September 11, 2001. It portrays a scenario of rights vs. rights: on the one hand the rights of individuals who seek protection and, on the other, the right of a State to protect itself and provide security to its citizens. The contest of rights takes place in a dualist environment created by governments ("us" and "them") and the national security concerns of the state subordinate individual rights. In doing so the Chapter One concludes that with the use of anti-terrorism and national security law and policy asylum seekers and refugees are criminalised and treated with discontent which has resulted in their basic human and legal rights being curtailed. Chapter Two has three aims: an analysis of the labeling and definition of a terrorist act; an examination of the theoretical and jurisprudential approaches to the exclusion of refugees and asylum seekers suspected of being terrorist; and, an exploration of the dignitary principles (that should be) used when assessing the possible exclusion from protection. Analysis of jurisprudence and policy since September 11, 2001, suggests the interpretation and use of exclusion clauses in the Refugee Convention have been transformed and, as a result gave rise to many criticisms. The conclusion is reached that when applied in its full spirit the Refugee Convention provides an effective and wide scope of protection both for the host states seeking security from terrorism and the individuals seeking refuge. However, the states have chosen to go beyond what the Refugee Convention proscribes and this trend has had a dire impact on the legal rights of asylum seekers and refugees. Chapter Three examines the respective anti-terror laws and procedures in Australia, the U. K. and the U. S., and the impact they have had on the legal rights of refugees and asylum seekers. It involves critiquing substantive law and an analysis of how and why the recent counter-terrorism legislation has been created. It pinpoints the tensions and contentious issues governments have experienced and sought to address. In doing so, differences and similarities are drawn out. For example, while the U. S. and the U. K. have codified aspects of international human rights law instruments in their domestic legislation and, consequently, also have procedures which provide a scrutiny of anti-terror laws and policy, Australia differs in her stance towards any scrutiny over her national laws and has viewed any criticism with suspicion and discontent. Moreover, while the U. S. and the U. K. have experienced terrorist attacks on their soil thus giving them the context in which anti-terror measures were argued to be justified, Australia used these attacks abroad to expand most of the anti-terror legislation. In comparing counter terrorism law and policy, specific provisions that directly or potentially have an impact on asylum seekers and refugees have been identified and compared in three different jurisdictions. In light of relevant international and regional human rights legal instruments, the conclusions underline how the rights of asylum seekers and refugees have been altered and/or reduced. Chapter Four examines how international law is incorporated in the three countries examined and how international human rights law standards become relevant to and indispensable in State practice. It selectively critiques the important, contentious and topical areas of mandatory detention, procedural rights and the rule of law, and the recent practice of <b>diplomatic</b> <b>assurances.</b> While emphasising the importance of international human rights law in relation to counter-terrorism and protection seekers, the chapter���s conclusion is that state practice - {{in a number of areas}} - does not fully comply with the international human rights law. Chapter Five, in the light of dignitary principles emanating from international law and academia, provides a number of safeguards and recommendations which, if implemented, could ensure that States observe the minimum standards of international human rights whilst protecting their national security and combating terrorism. In this chapter conclusions are also drawn on the success of anti-terror laws, and the desirability of their use in immigration control context. Evaluation is by a survey of successful prosecutions, as well as by reference to the ethical methods envisaged by international human rights law. In concluding remarks section, the themes addressed throughout the book are drawn together and a number of areas for further research are highlighted...|$|R
40|$|Pirates are {{literally}} {{getting away with}} murder. Modern pirates are attacking vessels, hijacking ships at gunpoint, taking hostages, and injuring and killing crew members. 1 They are doing so with increasing frequency. According to the International Maritime Bureau (“IMB”) Piracy Reporting Center’s 2009 Annual Report, there were 406 pirate attacks in 2009 —a number {{that has not been}} reached since 2003. Yet, in most instances, a culture of impunity reigns whereby nations are not holding pirates accountable for the violent crimes they commit. Only a small portion of those people committing piracy are actually captured and brought to trial, as opposed to captured and released. For example, in September 2008, a Danish warship captured ten Somali pirates, but then later released them on a Somali beach, even though the pirates were found with assault weapons and notes stating how they would split their piracy proceeds with warlords on land. Britain’s Royal Navy has been accused of releasing suspected pirates, 7 as have Canadian naval forces. Only very recently, Russia released captured Somali pirates—after a high-seas shootout between Russian marines and pirates that had attacked a tanker carrying twenty-three crew and US$ 52 million worth of oil. 9 In May 2010, the United States released ten captured pirates it had been holding for weeks after concluding that its search for a nation to prosecute them was futile. In fact, between March and April 2010, European Union (“EU”) naval forces captured 275 alleged pirates, but only forty face prosecution. Furthermore, when pirates are tried, they are often tried by Kenya or other African nations, rather than by the capturing nation. Kenya has entered into agreements with Canada, China, Denmark, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States to try the pirates these nations capture. Mauritius, Seychelles, and Tanzania have executed similar agreements to prosecute captured pirates. In an effort to aid prosecutions, Western states have pledged money—about US $ 10 million since May 2009 —to alleviate the strain on the “poorly equipped and corrupt criminal justice system” and {{to cover the cost of}} transporting witnesses, training police and prosecutors, and upgrading prisons and courts. 16 In fact, in late June 2010, the United Nations Office on Drug and Crimes (“UNODC”) used funds from donor nations to help open a new high-security courtroom in Mombasa, Kenya to prosecute pirates. 17 But why are Western states refusing to prosecute pirates on their own soil even though they—more so than less-developed nations—have the money and institutional capabilities to bring pirates to justice in a swift and fair manner? After all, these states are providing Kenya and other African nations with funds and support to help them conduct piracy trials. They are spending billions to support the various naval patrols that are capturing pirates—but thereafter releasing them to continue their criminal activities. While several reasons have been advanced to explain why nations may not be regularly prosecuting pirates, one reason often given to explain the reluctance of Western nations to try pirates on their own soil is the threat of asylum claims by convicted pirates. This reason has been advanced by academics and government representatives, among others. Roger Middleton, a researcher for Chatham House, the London-based think tank, explained it this way: “These countries don’t want to be bombarded by claims of asylum from the pirates, who would ask not to be deported to Somalia, a country at war. ” In fact, in April 2008, the British Foreign Office warned the Royal Navy that detaining pirates at sea could be a violation of their human rights and could also lead to asylum claims by pirates seeking to relocate to Europe. A former Tory chairman stated that ministers in Parliament had indicated privately that the reason captured pirates were not being brought to Britain for trial (including the sixty-six suspected pirates captured by the Royal Navy in 2009 —all of whom were thereafter released) was because of fears those pirates might seek asylum in the country. And at least some pirates have actually threatened to seek asylum in theWest. Reports indicate that two of the pirates on trial for attacking a Dutch vessel have declared their intention to try to stay on as residents. Nevertheless, although the threat of asylum claims is frequently offered to explain Western nations’ reluctance to prosecute pirates in their territories, what is not addressed is whether this fear has any actual basis in fact or law. Instead, the statement that nations are afraid of asylum claims is followed by little explanation at all—and certainly no legal analysis of the international or domestic laws on which convicted pirates would base their claims for asylum. In any event, even if the fear of asylum claims is well-founded, is this a reason to allow Western nations to avoid their duty to prosecute crimes that violate international law? Although some pirates are being prosecuted, why should others get away with murder solely because Western nations fear asylum claims? This Article is concerned with these issues and examines international refugee law and international human rights law in an effort to determine the likely viability of any asylum claims that may be brought by pirates convicted in the West. Based on an analysis of the text of the main international treaties governing asylum and non-refoulement, as well as interpretations of the provisions contained in those treaties, this Article concludes there is little reason to believe that Western states would be required to grant refugee status (as that term is defined in the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees) to convicted pirates. Among other things, pirates are not a group that is subject to persecution, and pirates have committed the types of serious and violent crimes that should exclude them from claiming refugee status—and thus, the residence and other benefits associated with being granted asylum. Second, states should be able to legally expel or deport convicted pirates under international human rights treaties since most pirates are likely unable to show they would face torture if expelled or returned to their country of origin. Even if pirates could show they risk torture or other inhumane treatment upon return, states may be able to satisfy their international obligations regarding non-refoulement and return pirates if the state receives <b>diplomatic</b> <b>assurances</b> that the authorities would not resort to such treatment. Furthermore, under the recent European Qualitative Directive, European Union Member States are not required to grant benefits such as residence permits to individuals who have committed serious and violent crimes, even though the European Convention on Human Rights prohibits refoulement to face torture or other ill treatment. Finally, even if there is some risk that some pirates can mount successful asylum or non-refoulement claims, the risk is one that developed Western states should assume because of the greater good that will come from ensuring that pirates are brought to justice (especially by way of fair trials and processes that respect human rights). 26 Developed nations risk asylum claims (by pirates and others) simply because they are developed—a status that typically carries with it an expectation that the state will protect human rights and enforce the rule of law. In this instance, enforcing the rule of law means that nations must invoke universal jurisdiction or use the prohibitions contained in international treaties and in their own domestic laws to prosecute violent and dangerous pirates even if it means they must consider and adjudicate some additional asylum claims. Bringing to justice the pirates that commit violent acts and disrupt international waters is a goal as worthy as numerous others where nations accept the risk of asylum claims, and pirates are unlikely to be deterred from committing those acts unless nations commit to end the current culture of impunity. Part I of this Article describes the modern piracy problem, including the international law governing piracy, and the culture of impunity that surrounds it. Part II provides a brief overview of the international law providing protection for those seeking asylum, focusing on international refugee law as well as the primary treaties under international human rights law that govern the transfer of persons and specifically prohibit transfer to states where those persons would be subjected to torture or ill treatment. Parts III and IV analyze international refugee law and international human rights law in the context of potential claims by convicted pirates seeking asylum and protection against nonrefoulement. The Article concludes by suggesting that although prosecuting pirates may require states to also consider additional asylum claims, the risk that states will have to grant such claims is small and also a burden they should assume so that pirates may be brought to justice...|$|R
