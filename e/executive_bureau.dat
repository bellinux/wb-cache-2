Its heads were generally regarded as chancellors (as it always had two heads, known as the Shàngshūpúshè (尚書僕射)).

25|$|When Habré {{rebelled against}} Goukouni in 1980, Nouri {{was once again}} by his side, and for this he was tried by a special {{criminal}} court and on June 13, 1981, sentenced together with Idriss Miskine to hard labour for life, while {{the leader of the}} FAN, Habré, was sentenced to death. This did not deter Nouri from returning to prominence when Habré conquered the capital N'Djamena in 1982: as Habré's right hand, Nouri became the new regime's number 2. In 1984 he was made Commissioner for External Affairs in the <b>Executive</b> <b>Bureau</b> of the country's only legal party, the National Union for Independence and Revolution (UNIR), and was to eventually obtain the chairmanship of the party.|$|E
25|$|The Aircraft Board {{came under}} severe {{criticism}} {{for failure to}} meet goals or its own claims of aircraft production, followed by a highly publicized personal investigation by Gutzon Borglum, a harshly vocal critic of the board. Borglum had exchanged letters with President Wilson, a personal friend, from which he assumed an appointment to investigate had been authorized, which the administration soon denied. Both the U.S. Senate and the Department of Justice began investigations into possible fraudulent dealings. President Wilson also acted by appointing a Director of Aircraft Production on April 28, 1918, and abolished the Air Division of the OCSO, creating a Division of Military Aeronautics (DMA) with Brigadier General William L. Kenly brought back from France to be its head, to separate supervision of aviation from {{the duties of the}} Chief Signal Officer. Less than a month later, Wilson used a war powers provision of the Overman Act of May 20, 1918, to issue Executive Order No. 2862 that suspended {{for the duration of the}} war plus six months the statutory responsibilities of the Aviation Section and removed the DMA entirely from the Signal Corps (reporting directly to the Secretary of War). The DMA was assigned the function of procuring and training a combat force. In addition, the executive order created a Bureau of Aircraft Production (BAP), a military organization with a civilian director, as a separate <b>executive</b> <b>bureau</b> to provide the aircraft needed.|$|E
25|$|From 2001 to 2004, Ponta {{held the}} rank of Secretary of State {{as head of the}} government's Control Department. In 2006, a civil servant at the Ministry of Education (who was in an ongoing feud with Ponta) charged that Ponta, while holding this office, covered up corrupt {{activities}} undertaken by former minister Hildegard Puwak, who was cleared of wrongdoing in a report issued by Ponta. Additionally, he helped uncover cases of fraudulent use of Phare funds. In 2001 he also joined the supervisory council of the Authority for State Assets Recovery, and that year he was part of a special committee investigating penal infractions committed by members of the government. In March 2004, he became Minister-Delegate for Control of International Grant Programmes Implementation and for Monitoring the Application of the Acquis Communautaire. A PSD member by 2002, he was from July to November of that year head of the Interim National Council of the Social Democratic Youth (TSD). That October, he {{became a member of the}} PSD's national council, and joined its <b>executive</b> <b>bureau</b> the following month, when he also became president of the TSD, remaining as such for four years. In 2005, he became a vice president of Ecosy, while he has been a vice president of the PSD since December 2006. At the 2004 election, Ponta won a seat in the Chamber of Deputies, where he served as both secretary and vice president of its permanent bureau; he was re-elected in 2008. That December, he became a minister in the incoming Boc cabinet.|$|E

500|$|The 6th Congress {{was held}} at the February 8 House of Culture from 10–14 October 1980, with a recess on 11 October. Compared to its predecessor, the 6th Congress was fairly short. It began with opening {{addresses}} by Kim Il-sung, the <b>Executive</b> <b>Bureau,</b> the Secretariat and the Credentials Committee. After the opening remarks, the congress' agenda was decided: [...] "(1) Summing up the work of the Party Central Committee; (2) Evaluation of the work of the Party Central Auditing Committee; (3) Revision of the Party Rules and (4) Election of the central leading agencies of the Party." [...] This was followed by a report on the Central Committee's performance since the 5th Congress. The 6th Congress was adjourned on 11 October, and 12 October began with the election of a committee to draft congressional decisions. Lee Nak-bin then delivered a report on the work of the Central Auditing Committee since the 5th Congress.

5000|$|The <b>Executive</b> Policy <b>Bureau</b> was {{established}} at the 2nd Conference in October 1966, and was similar to its counterpart in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) during the Stalin era. The formal head of the <b>Executive</b> Policy <b>Bureau</b> is the Chairman and it was responsible for overseeing and implementing party policies and supervising party organs. Although the <b>Executive</b> Policy <b>Bureau's</b> degree of independence is unknown, it is probably subservient to the WPK leader (again, similar to the CPSU Secretariat under Stalin). Until 1966, the WPK had no body similar to the Secretariat; this was unusual, since a Secretariat {{was one of the}} most powerful bodies in other ruling communist parties. The Secretariat {{was established}} during a power struggle as a means of strengthening Kim Il-sung's control over the party's lower-level organizations; for this reason, a large majority of 1st Secretariat members were full or candidate members of the WPK Politburo. After the power struggle ended in 1967-1968, the Secretariat's status waned; this [...] "has been reflected by the lower status of cadres appointed to the Secretariat in recent years", especially at the 6th Congress. At that congress, only three members (out of nine) served concurrently as full Politburo members: Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il and Kim Jung-rin (not a Kim family member).|$|R
