25|$|To be an {{efficient}} manufacturing facility, a loomshop needed good daylight, controlled ventilation, un-obstructed space, provision for storage, heat, and access for goods and workers. Hand looms were manual, the artisan raised the heddles using foot levers, {{and threw the}} shuttle {{the width of the}} loom by hand, forward and back. The left hand was used to operate the batten that compressed the pick. Broader cloth could not be woven this way, so the weaver used a child to throw back the shuttle. John Kay's flying shuttle of 1733, removed the need for the child. The weaver <b>jerked</b> <b>the</b> two hammers or pickers with a picking stick held in the right hand. The pickers propelled the shuttle, and the left hand operated the batten.|$|E
2500|$|At the retrofire event, {{the pitch}} horizon scanner malfunctioned once more, forcing Carpenter to {{manually}} control his reentry, which {{caused him to}} overshoot the planned splashdown point by [...] ("The malfunction of the pitch horizon scanner circuit [...] dictated that the pilot manually control the spacecraft attitudes during this event.") The PHS malfunction <b>jerked</b> <b>the</b> spacecraft off in yaw by 25 degrees to the right, accounting for [...] of the overshoot; the delay caused by the automatic sequencer required Carpenter to fire the retrorockets manually. This effort took two pushes of the override button and accounted for another 15 to [...] of the overshoot. The loss of thrust in the ripple pattern of the retros added another , producing a [...] overshoot.|$|E
