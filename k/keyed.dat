5|$|Nordic {{folk music}} {{encompasses}} traditions from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland and the dependent countries Åland Islands, Faroe Islands, and Greenland, and nearby regions. Specific instruments vary between countries and regions, but some common instruments include the lur, säckpipa, Hardanger fiddle, <b>keyed</b> fiddle, willow flute, harp, mouth harp, and animal horns. Common genres in Nordic folk include ballads, herding music, and dance music, genres which trace {{back to the}} medieval era. Often, Nordic melodies will contain the phrase C2-B-G.|$|E
5|$|The Raptors {{finished}} 41-41, six fewer wins {{than the}} previous season, but still good enough for a playoff spot as the 6th seed. They were pitted against Dwight Howard and the resurgent Orlando Magic. In Game 1, Dwight Howard gave the Magic their first playoff win since 2003 as they practically led the entire game. Howard would put up a 29–20 in Game 2, as Hedo Türkoğlu scored the final four go-ahead points to give the Magic a 2–0 lead. The Raptors would respond with a strong Game 3 victory <b>keyed</b> by great point guard play from Ford and José Calderon. However, Jameer Nelson, Rashard Lewis and Keith Bogans <b>keyed</b> strong three point shooting in Game 4 and overcame Bosh's 39 points and 15 rebounds to bring the Magic out of Toronto with a 3–1 lead. Howard would finish off the series in Game 5 as impressively as he started: 21 points, 21 rebounds, 3 blocks. Whereas the preceding season was considered a success, the 2007–08 campaign was considered a disappointment. Weaknesses in Toronto's game—rebounding, defence, {{and a lack of}} a swingman—were brought into sharp focus during the playoffs, and changes were expected to be made to the roster.|$|E
5|$|When Press Your Luck {{returned}} after the weekend break, the episode {{started with the}} same freeze frame image. Tomarken (again chroma <b>keyed</b> over the image) then brought the viewers {{up to speed on}} what Friday's episode entailed, first by introducing Larson's opponents and then explaining what Larson had done so far, before the game resumed. Freeze frames were also used to lead {{into and out of the}} first two commercial breaks, with voice overs by Tomarken leading into and out of them.|$|E

5|$|Goffman {{uses the}} metaphor of {{conversation}} being a stage play. A plays tone will shift throughout the performance due to the actions taken by the actors; {{this is similar to}} how a discussion is <b>keyed</b> – based on what either person says or does over the course of an interaction, the key will change accordingly. The parallels go further, though. Goffman also claims that a speaker details a drama more often than they provide information. They invite the listener to empathize and, as was explained above, they’re often not meant to be stirred to take action, but rather to show appreciation; during a play this generally takes the form of applause.|$|E
5|$|Doug Flutie {{made his}} NFL {{debut in the}} fourth quarter for the Chicago Bears. The Bears took an early 14–0 lead after Mike Tomczak's 37-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Willie Gault. The play occurred after Ervin Randle's recovery of a Calvin Thomas fumble was nullified due to an offsides penalty on Craig Swoope. While the Buccaneers' defense improved later in the game, it was not enough to overcome the problems of the injury-battered offense. Nathan Wonsley suffered a broken neck while making a tackle on the opening kickoff. This was followed by injuries to Jerry Bell, Phil Freeman, Craig Swoope, and Willie Gillespie. Calvin Magee played with a prior injury, as did James Wilder and Leonard Harris, though both were forced to leave the game. With Gerald Carter left as the only experienced receiver, the Bears <b>keyed</b> on him, and with Bell, Wonsley and Wilder out, the Buccaneers could not run.|$|E
5|$|In the {{accordion}} experiment, Home {{sat at a}} table, with Crookes and another observer {{on either side of}} him, each with a foot on one of Home's feet. Home inserted his hand inside a wire cage that was pushed under the table. One of Home's hands was placed {{on the top of the}} table, and the other inside the cage which held an accordion on the non-key side, so the <b>keyed</b> end was hanging downwards. The accordion was reported to have played musical sounds. However, the amount of light in the room was not stated, and {{the accordion}} was not observed in good light. According to Frank Podmore there was no evidence the accordion played at all, as the keys were not observed to have moved. Podmore suggested the musical sounds could have come from an automatic instrument that Home had concealed.|$|E

25|$|<b>Keyed</b> or Fingered brass {{instruments}} used holes along {{the body of}} the instrument, which were covered by fingers or by finger-operated pads (keys) in a similar way to a woodwind instrument.

25|$|Though tries {{are usually}} <b>keyed</b> by {{character}} strings, {{they need not}} be.

50|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{technique used}} in public <b>key</b> cryptography {{is the use}} of asymmetric <b>key</b> algorithms, where a <b>key</b> used by one party to perform encryption {{is not the same as}} the <b>key</b> used by another in decryption. Each user has a pair of cryptographic <b>keys</b> - a public encryption <b>key</b> and a private decryption <b>key.</b> For example, a <b>key</b> pair used for digital signatures consists of a private signing <b>key</b> and a public verification <b>key.</b> The public <b>key</b> may be widely distributed, while the private <b>key</b> is known only to its proprietor.
