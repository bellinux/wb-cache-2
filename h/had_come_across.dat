5|$|Nevertheless, {{three out}} of the serial's twelve episodes have been recovered. 16mm copies of episodes 5 and 10 were {{returned}} in the early 1980s, under unclear circumstances (with rumour claiming they {{were found in the}} basement of a Mormon church). Episode 2 was returned in 2004 by former BBC engineer Francis Watson. He <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>across</b> the film in the 1970s, while clearing a projector testing room at the BBC's Ealing Studios. Instead of disposing of the film as instructed, he brought it home – eventually to return it to the Corporation when he realised the value of the material.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1892, as the {{aftershock}} of the stand-off was still being felt throughout the county, two alleged horse rustlers were gunned down by range detectives east of the Big Horn River. The killers escaped the law with assistance from Otto Franc, a rancher who had sided with the large cattle company faction. On May 24, 1893, Nate Champion's brother, Dudley Champion, came to Wyoming looking for work before he {{was shot and killed}} in cold blood. Fifteen miles from town, Dudley <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>across</b> the ranch of Mike Shonsey, who, after seeing the young man, immediately grabbed a gun and fired at him. A coroner's inquiry ruled Shonsey's actions were self-defense and he was acquitted of murder. Afterwards, Shonsey left the country before the officials could continue with the investigation. A year before, Shonsey actually met Nate Champion near the Beaver Creek Canyon, where a fight almost commenced between the two as Nate suspected that Shonsey was one of the five men who had attacked him in his cabin. He further threatened Shonsey and demanded he give up the names {{of the rest of the}} assassins. This event made Shonsey harbor hatred toward Nate and probably toward his brother Dudley as well. Dudley Champion was the last person killed who was associated with the Johnson County War.|$|E

25|$|Christianity {{was most}} likely first {{introduced}} into the lands of present-day Ukraine by the Goths, who established the Chernyakhov culture in the 2nd century. Although not a Christian people as a whole, the incoming Ostrogoths certainly had relations with Christian centres such as Rome and <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>across</b> missionaries in the lands they had previously inhabited; it is therefore believed {{that some of the}} Gothic inhabitants of Oium were Christian, as they had established churches in other lands occupied by the Goths. However, the Gothic control over the area proved to be short-lived, as the Hunnic Empire swept into the area in the 4th century, making any lasting impression by the Goths unlikely.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} D-Day, Major General Taylor and the {{commander}} of the 101st Airborne Division Artillery, Brigadier General Anthony McAuliffe returned from their foray at Pouppeville. Taylor had control of approximately 2,500 of his 6,600 men, most of which were {{in the vicinity of the}} 506th CP at Culoville, with the thin defense line west of Saint Germain-du-Varreville, or the division reserve at Blosville. Two glider airlifts had brought in scant reinforcements and had resulted in the death of his assistant division commander (ADC), Brigadier General Don Pratt.

This suspicion was heightened, when the crew of the discovery boat came aboard and informed the captain they <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>across</b> a new moccasin as well as the partially butchered remains of a seal. At dinner that evening, the crew observed a man approaching the ship who was shortly joined by eight to ten others. Both Barnard and the survivors from the Isabella had harboured concern the other party was Spanish and were relieved to discover their respective nationalities.|$|E
25|$|In August 1984 Jennings handed {{off control}} of the nodelist to the group in St. Louis, mostly Ken Kaplan and Ben Baker. Kaplan <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>across</b> Fido as part of finding a BBS {{solution}} for his company, which worked with DEC computers and {{had been given a}} Rainbow computer and a USRobotics 1200bit/s modem. From then on, joining FidoNet required one to set up their system and use it to deliver a netmail message to a special system, Node 51. The message contained various required contact information. If this message was transmitted successfully, it ensured {{that at least some of}} the system was working properly. The nodelist team would then reply with another netmail message back to the system in question, containing the assigned node number. If delivery succeeded, the system was considered to be working properly, and it was added to the nodelist. The first new nodelist was published on 21 September 1984.|$|E

25|$|In {{the next}} two years, {{especially}} during the period between April 1867 and March 1868, the 8th US Cavalry were in almost constant combat with the Apache {{and became one of}} the US Army's most experienced cavalry regiments. When several bands of Apache began raiding settlements, killing settlers and stealing livestock throughout the territory in the late summer and fall of 1868, Wortman was among the troopers tasked with protecting the entire Arizona Territory. These consisted of no more the 50 or 60 soldiers, mainly taken from Troops B and L of the 8th US Cavalry, who faced repeated ambushes and were often shot at by snipers during their duties. On one of these patrols, Wortman led a 15-man scouting party across the Salinas River. He had made three previous patrols in the area under Lieutenant Colonel Thomas C. Devin, then commanding officer of the 8th US Cavalry, and was familiar with the area. He and his group found a small rancheria nearby, seemingly deserted like many other camps they <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>across,</b> where they were attacking in a poorly planned ambush by four Apaches. All four were killed by the troopers. One of them was killed, shot in the chest at point-blank range, by Wortman himself when the Apache charged at him with a knife.|$|E
500|$|Tillman later {{recalled}} that [...] "the leading white men of Edgefield" [...] had decided [...] "to seize {{the first opportunity}} that the Negroes might offer them to provoke a riot and teach the Negroes a lesson" [...] by [...] "having the whites demonstrate their superiority by killing {{as many of them}} as was justifiable". Hamburg was their first such opportunity. Ninety-four white men, including Tillman, were indicted by a coroner's jury, but none was prosecuted for the killings. Butler blamed the deaths on intoxicated factory workers and Irish-Americans who <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>across</b> the bridge from Augusta, and over whom he had no control.|$|E

[...] Smart later told The New York Times that she decided she was eager to play the role after reading the character's introductory scene, and commented that in her almost 30years of acting she <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>across</b> few roles that offered the possibilities that this one did: a character that is sexy, mysterious, and powerful, yet is mentally unstable and has lost her trust and respect for her husband.|$|E

500|$|The Canadian border {{along the}} {{southern}} edge of Alberta was occupied by the Blackfoot Confederacy, a First Nation whose economy was based on hunting bison. The Blackfoot had suffered badly from smallpox, and were under increasing pressure from rival groups of Sioux and Piegans that had crossed into Canada, fleeing the expansion of the United States military across the southern plains. Whiskey-traders from the United States <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>across</b> the border, selling alcohol to the aboriginal peoples, fuelling social problems and outbreaks of violence. Although the region remained relatively safe, there was no civil government, and military explorers highlighted the [...] "lawlessness" [...] and lack of [...] "security for life or property" [...] that resulted from the absence of a formal justice system.|$|E
500|$|As {{with several}} others of his works, Fleming {{appropriated}} {{the names of}} people he knew for the story's characters.

Arran, an advocate of the relaxation of the British laws relating to homosexuality, heard about the use of his name before publication and complained to Fleming about it, but was ignored and the name was retained for the novel. During his trip to America Fleming <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>across</b> the name Spang—old German for [...] "maker of shoe buckles"—which he appropriated for the villainous brothers.|$|E

A lot of the folks who represented summer and spring and fall had been killed and assassinated. The only season left is winter. ...Bobby Kennedy and Dr. King and John Kennedy, those were folks who represented spring and summer, and they killed them. So we wanted to do an album about where we were. And we weren't trying to depress people, hell, they were living it, they already knew but we were trying to describe it and were certainly not alone... we felt as though a part of it was the folks in charge of the political structure. They were snowmen..." ...|$|E
500|$|The four of {{them would}} get {{together}} in Vannucci's garage to work on song ideas. They would also sneak into the band room at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (where Vannucci was studying classical percussion) at night to practice. It was during this period that the band wrote much of their debut album Hot Fuss including hit singles [...] "Somebody Told Me" [...] and [...] "Smile Like You Mean It". The band continued playing at small venues around their hometown, often playing Sunday nights at a transvestite bar named Sasha's (later renamed Tramps). It wasn't long before they {{caught the attention of}} Braden Merrick, an A rep for Warner Bros. Records who <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>across</b> their demo on a website dedicated to unsigned bands in the Las Vegas area; after attending a live show he offered to help the band find a record deal and eventually became their manager. He took the band to the San Francisco area, to Berkeley, California, to record demos with former Green Day manager Jeff Saltzman, they then sent the demo tapes out to major record labels in the US. The band was invited to perform at a number of showcases but were ultimately not signed, the band however did catch the eye of Alex Gilbert, who was an A rep from the United Kingdom. Gilbert took a demo with him back to the UK and showed it to his friend Ben Durling, who worked at the newly formed Independent label Lizard King Records in London. Despite not yet meeting the band in person, Lizard King were quick to offer the band a deal based on the strength of the five song demo. The Killers signed with the British label in July 2003.|$|E
500|$|In the 1971 Candidates matches, Fischer {{was set to}} {{play against}} Soviet {{grandmaster}} and concert pianist Mark Taimanov in the quarter-finals. [...] "Their match was to begin in May 1971 in Vancouver, Canada, on the beautiful campus of the University of British Columbia." [...] "Analysts and players alike predicted that Fischer would win the Candidates, but not without a struggle. Tal predicted that Fischer would win 5½–4½ against Taimanov." [...] " [...] saw himself as the firm favorite in the Taimanov match. He was not alone; the noncommunist press was of the same mind. Only Taimanov insisted that he could win, dismissing Fischer as a mere computer". Taimanov had reason to be confident. He was backed by the firm guidance of Botvinnik, who [...] "had thoroughly analysed Fischer's record and put together a 'dossier' on him", from {{when he was in}} talks to play Fischer in a match [...] "a couple of years earlier". After Fischer defeated Taimanov in the second game of the match, Taimanov asked Fischer how he managed {{to come up with the}} move 12. N1c3, to which Fischer replied [...] "that the idea was not his—he <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>across</b> it in the monograph by the Soviet master Alexander Nikitin in a footnote". Taimanov said of this: [...] "It is staggering that I, an expert on the Sicilian, should have missed this theoretically significant idea by my compatriot, while Fischer had uncovered it in a book in a foreign language!" [...] With the score at 4–0, in Fischer's favor, the fifth game adjournment was a sight to behold. Schonberg explains the scene:Taimanov came to Vancouver with two seconds, both grandmasters. Fischer was alone. He thought that the sight of Taimanov and his seconds was the funniest thing he had ever seen. There Taimanov and his seconds would sit, six hands flying, pocket sets waving in the air, while variations were being spouted all over the place. And there sat Taimanov with a confused look on his face. Just before resuming play [...] the seconds were giving Taimanov some last-minute advice. When poor Taimanov entered the playing room and sat down to confront Fischer, his head was so full of conflicting continuations that he became rattled, left a Rook en prise and immediately resigned. Fischer beat Taimanov by the score of 6–0. [...] "The record books showed that the only comparable achievement to the 6–0 score against Taimanov was Wilhelm Steinitz's 7–0 win against Joseph Henry Blackburne in 1876 in an era of more primitive defensive technique." [...] "Who would have imagined that any challenger's match would ever have been decided by a perfect score, when the participants are all to be ranked among the strongest players in the world?" [...] "It is difficult to portray to non-chess players the magnitude of such a shutout. A typical result between well-matched players might be, say, six wins to four, with nine draws". Taimanov later recalled, [...] "When Grand Masters play, they see the logic of their opponent's moves. One's moves may be so powerful that the other may not be able to stop him, but the plan behind the moves will be clear. Not so with Fischer. His moves did not make sense..." ...|$|E
