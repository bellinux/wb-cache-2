5|$|A {{pathology}} {{has been}} identified on the tail of Apatosaurus, caused by a growth defect. Two caudal vertebrae are seamlessly fused along the entire articulating surface of the bone, including the arches of the neural spines. This defect might {{have been caused by}} the lack or inhibition of the substance that forms intervertebral disks or joints. It has been proposed that the whips could have been used in combat, but the tails of diplodocids were quite light and narrow compared to Shunosaurus and mamenchisaurids, and thus to <b>injure</b> another animal with the tail would severely <b>injure</b> the tail itself.|$|E
5|$|At {{the high}} school, Shane and Otis split up after {{struggling}} against {{a horde of}} walkers. Both <b>injure</b> their legs while escaping, slowing their progress down. Shane and Otis seemingly are out of options for survival. They begin to limp back to their truck, eventually running low on ammo.|$|E
5|$|Gerardo Mazzetta {{and colleagues}} (1998) {{propose that the}} horns might also {{have been used to}} <b>injure</b> or kill small prey. Though horn cores are blunt, they may have had a similar form to modern bovid horns if there was a keratinous covering. However, this would be the only {{reported}} example of horns being used as hunting weapons in animals.|$|E

5|$|The Monster saves a young shepherdess (Anne Darling) from drowning. Her screams {{upon seeing}} him alert two hunters, who shoot and <b>injure</b> the creature. The hunters raise a mob that sets out in pursuit. Captured and trussed to a pole, the Monster is hauled to a dungeon and chained. Left alone, he breaks his chains, kills {{the guards and}} escapes into the woods.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} renewed calls {{by many in}} Japan for the United States to {{make more}} effort in reducing crimes and accidents involving U.S. military personnel who <b>injure</b> or kill Japanese citizens. In response to the accident, the Navy changed its policies regarding civilian visits to its ships.|$|E
50|$|Attacks {{were focused}} on the central parts of Iraq on 1 May, {{including}} a pair of bombings in Al-Karmah that killed a Sahwa member and <b>injured</b> at least 16 other militiamen. A suicide bomber killed six east of Fallujah, while another blast and a shooting inside the city left three soldiers and a policeman dead and another officer <b>injured.</b> Four policemen died in a roadside bombing in Baiji, while two others were killed in twin bombings in Ramadi. At least thirteen others were <b>injured</b> in those incidents, including 3 officers. Bombings and shootings in Baqubah killed three, including a local cleric, and <b>injured</b> 11 others. Roadside bombings killed a soldier and <b>injured</b> four civilians in Kanaan and Tal Afar. Similar attacks <b>injured</b> five others in Kirkuk and Jalawla. In the capital Baghdad a bomb blast ripped through the Husseiniya neighborhood, killing 4 and <b>injuring</b> 12 others. At nearby Abu Ghraib mortar fire <b>injured</b> at least 11 civilians. Despite the overall reduction in violence, at least 25 were killed and 73 <b>injured</b> during the day - figures {{much higher than the}} average daily death toll before the Hawija clashes on 23 April. These dropped on 2 May, when only 12 killed and 23 <b>injured</b> were reported from across the country, most of them members of the security forces. Clashes in Mosul killed three, while a political candidate was assassinated in the city as well. A suicide bomber killed a captain and <b>injured</b> 4 soldiers in Abu Faraj, and a bombing killed 2 soldiers and <b>injured</b> another in Yusufiya. The chief of police for Kirkuk Province escaped an assassination attempt, which <b>injured</b> four policemen guarding him. Roadside blasts killed 2 civilians and <b>injured</b> 6 others in Baqubah and Ramadi. Gunmen <b>injured</b> 4 policemen in Numaniya, while 2 others were <b>injured</b> and one killed in a bombing in Karbala. A Katuysha rocket attack near Abu Ghraib killed one soldiers and <b>injured</b> 2 others.|$|R

5|$|A few teleosts are dangerous. Some, like eeltail catfish (Plotosidae), scorpionfish (Scorpaenidae) or {{stonefish}} (Synanceiidae) have venomous spines {{that can}} seriously <b>injure</b> or kill humans. Some, like the electric eel and the electric catfish, {{can give a}} severe electric shock. Others, such as the piranha and barracuda, have a powerful bite and have sometimes attacked human bathers. Reports indicate {{that some of the}} catfish family can be large enough to prey on human bathers.|$|E
5|$|After {{missing a}} few weeks, Mercury {{returned}} wearing a protective face mask and his injury was worked into the angle, with {{both he and}} Nitro attempting to <b>injure</b> the Hardys in various ways for revenge. MNM lost to The Hardys at the Royal Rumble, and again at the No Way Out pay-per-view in February which concluded the feud. He also wrestled in singles competition on SmackDown! until {{he was released from}} his WWE contract on March 26, 2007.|$|E
5|$|Ancient texts use ahimsa to mean non-injury, {{a broader}} concept than non-violence. Non-injury implies not killing others, {{as well as}} not hurting others mentally or verbally; it {{includes}} avoiding all violent means—including physical violence—anything that injures others. In classical Sanskrit literature of Hinduism, another word Adrohi is sometimes used instead of Ahimsa, {{as one of the}} cardinal virtues necessary for moral life. One example is in Baudhayana Dharmasutra 2.6.23: वाङ्-मनः-कर्म-दण्डैर् भूतानाम् अद्रोही (One who does not <b>injure</b> others with words, thoughts or acts is named Adrohi).|$|E

5|$|As the {{fortress}} expands and develops, new noble positions become available. While regular dwarves {{will be happy}} with simple rooms provided to them, dwarves appointed or elected to noble positions will need more luxurious accommodation. Nobles will even make demands and , getting negative thoughts {{if they are not}} fulfilled. A justice system is present to punish criminals, for example, dwarves who <b>injure</b> or kill another dwarf or destroy furniture. Occasionally, a vampire dwarf, with a fake background history, may arrive with a migrant wave and start killing and feeding on the other citizens without being noticed.|$|E
5|$|Coloured {{gold and}} green, the frogs are {{voracious}} eaters of insects, {{but will also}} eat larger prey, such as worms and mice. Unlike most frogs, they are active at day, although this is mostly to warm in the sun. They {{tend to be less}} active in winter except in warmer or wetter periods, and breed in the warmer months. Males reach maturity after around 9 months, while for the larger females, this does not occur until they are two years old. The frogs can engage in cannibalism, and males frequently attack and <b>injure</b> one another if they infringe on one another's space.|$|E
5|$|Coral {{reefs and}} shallow marine environments are threatened, {{not only by}} natural events and {{increased}} sea temperatures, but also by such man-made problems as pollution, sedimentation and destructive fishing practices. Pollution {{may be the result}} of run-off from the land of sewage, agricultural products, fuel or chemicals. These may directly kill or <b>injure</b> marine life, or may encourage the growth of algae that smother native species, or form algal blooms with wide-ranging effects. Oil spills at sea can contaminate reefs, and also affect the eggs and larva of marine life drifting near the surface.|$|E

50|$|Gunmen using {{silencers}} shot 10 soldiers dead at {{a checkpoint}} in Mushada, northwest of Baghdad, <b>injuring</b> at least 10 others. At least seven explosions and several shootings killed 8 and wounded 29 in Kirkuk, while a suicide car bombing killed 11 officers and <b>injured</b> 31 others at an anti-terrorism office in Daquq. A suicide bombing at a tea shop in Tal Afar killed 7 and <b>injured</b> 25. Attacks in Mosul killed another nine people and <b>injured</b> 27. Ten {{people were killed}} and 9 <b>injured</b> in three separate incidents in Diyala Province near Baqubah, most of them members of the security forces. A car bomb in Kut killed at least 7 and <b>injured</b> more than 70 others. Four police officers were killed and six <b>injured</b> in attacks around Fallujah. Gunmen killed two civilians at a market in Baaj, and a bomb in Tuz Khormato killed a woman and <b>injured</b> 4 others. Bombings also took place in Badush, Abu Ghraib, Al Wajehiya, Hawija, Ramadi and Iskandariya, killing 4 and leaving 24 <b>injured.</b> Unidentified gunmen killed three and <b>injured</b> 5 others in several attacks in Dhouib, al-Rasul and Aswad.|$|R

5|$|Crush {{injuries}} {{are common in}} major disasters, especially in earthquakes. The aftermath of the 1988 Spitak earthquake prompted the establishment, in 1995, of the Renal Disaster Relief Task Force, a working group of the International Society of Nephrology (a worldwide body of kidney experts). Its volunteer doctors and nurses assisted {{for the first time}} in the 1999 İzmit earthquake in Turkey, where 17,480 people died, 5392 were hospitalized and 477 received dialysis, with positive results. Treatment units are generally established outside the immediate disaster area, as aftershocks could potentially <b>injure</b> or kill staff and make equipment unusable.|$|E
5|$|Destruction and {{encroachment}} {{of habitat}} by humans is another threat to loggerhead sea turtles. Optimum nesting beaches are open-sand beaches above the high-tide line. However, beach development deprives them of suitable nesting areas, {{forcing them to}} nest closer to the surf. Urbanization often leads to the siltation of sandy beaches, decreasing their viability. Construction of docks and marinas can destroy near-shore habitats. Boat traffic and dredging degrades habitat and can also <b>injure</b> or kill turtles when boats collide with turtles {{at or near the}} surface.|$|E
5|$|For {{the most}} part, slaves were treated harshly and oppressively during the Roman republican period. Under Republican law, a slave was not {{considered}} a person, but property. Owners could abuse, <b>injure</b> or even kill their own slaves without legal consequence. While there were many grades and types of slaves, the lowest—and most numerous—grades {{who worked in the}} fields and mines were subject to a life of hard physical labor.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} 1965 that {{recruitment}} of fighters increased along with popular support, and the strike teams were able to increase in size. The increase in popular support was {{in part due to}} FRELIMO agencies' offer of help to exiled Mozambicans, who had fled the conflict by travelling to nearby Tanzania. Like similar conflicts against the French and United States forces in Vietnam, the insurgents also used landmines to a great extent to <b>injure</b> the Portuguese forces, thus straining the armed forces' infrastructure and demoralising soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Large whales, such as mysticetes, are {{not usually}} subject to predation, but smaller whales, such as monodontids or ziphiids, are. These species are preyed on by the killer whale or orca. To subdue and kill whales, orcas {{continuously}} ram them with their heads; this can sometimes kill bowhead whales, or severely <b>injure</b> them. Other times they corral the narwhals or belugas before striking. They are typically hunted by groups of 10 or fewer orcas, but they are seldom attacked by an individual. Calves are more commonly taken by orcas, but adults can be targeted as well.|$|E
5|$|Many {{plants have}} {{external}} structural defenses that discourage herbivory. Depending on the herbivore’s physical characteristics (i.e. size and defensive armor), plant structural defenses on stems and leaves can deter, <b>injure,</b> or kill the grazer. Some defensive compounds are produced internally but are released onto the plant’s surface; for example, resins, lignins, silica, and wax cover the epidermis of terrestrial plants and alter {{the texture of}} the plant tissue. The leaves of holly plants, for instance, are very smooth and slippery making feeding difficult. Some plants produce gummosis or sap that traps insects.|$|E
