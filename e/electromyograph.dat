The <b>electromyographs</b> during parturition were characterized by synchronic and well propagated phases of activity that could first appear {{at any of the}} four electrodes; however, initiation occurred most frequently at the electrodes on the two extreme ends of a horn. Analysis of the relative occurrence of tubocervically and cervicotubally propagated activity phases indicated that the latter were present, and even could dominate, before and during expulsion of the piglets. The mean duration of the activity phases decreased and their mean propagation-time along the horn increased after emptying of the horn. However, before as well as after completion of delivery, a wide range in propagation-time of even two successive activity phases was measured. It is concluded that a decrease in uterine volume is responsible for the rather abrupt changes of the characteristics of myometrial activity upon delivery of the piglets from a horn.

Results showed the size of motor units increased linearly with increased force production, and firing rate remained constant to 30% maximum force and then increased with greater generation of force.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence {{that individuals with}} non-specific low back pain (LBP) have altered movement coordination., however, the relationship of this neuromotor impairment to recurrent pain episodes is unknown. To assess coordination while minimizing the confounding influences of pain we characterized automatic postural responses to multi-directional support surface translations in individuals {{with a history of}} LBP who were not in an active episode of their pain.

Individuals with LBP demonstrated reduced peak trunk torques, and enhanced activation of the trunk and ankle muscle responses following perturbations. These results suggest that individuals with LBP use a strategy of trunk stiffening achieved through co-activation of trunk musculature, aided by enhanced distal responses, to respond to unexpected support surface perturbations. Notably, these neuromotor alterations persisted between active pain periods and could represent either movement patterns that have developed in response to pain or could reflect underlying impairments that may contribute to recurrent episodes of LBP...|$|R

Forces generated via intraspinal microstimulation at different hindlimb positions were recorded and interpolated, generating representations of force patterns at the paw. <b>Electromyographs</b> (EMGs) of hindlimb muscles, medial gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, vastus lateralis, and biceps femoris posterior, were also collected to examine relationships between activated muscles and force pattern types. The same four force pattern types obtained in spinal-intact cats were found in chronic spinal cats. Proportions of force patterns in spinal cats differed significantly from those in intact cats, but no significant differences in proportions were observed among individual spinal groups (Op-control, NTF, Trained, and Combination). However, the proportions of force patterns differed significantly between trained (Trained and Combination) and untrained groups (Op-control and NTF). Thus the frequency of expression of some response types was modified by injury {{and to a lesser extent}} by training. Force pattern laminar distribution differed in spinal cats compared with intact, with more responses obtained dorsally (0 – 1, 000 μm) and fewer ventrally (3, 200 – 5, 200 μm).

40|$|To {{elucidate}} the cortical circuitry controlling primate forelimb muscles we investigated the synaptic interactions between neighboring motor cortex cells that had postspike output effects in target muscles. In monkeys generating isometric ramp-and-hold wrist torques, pairs of cortical cells were recorded simultaneously with independent electrodes and corticomotoneuronal (“CM”) cells {{were identified by}} their postspike effects on target forelimb muscles in spike-triggered averages (SpTAs) of <b>electromyographs</b> (EMGs). The response patterns of the cells were determined in response-aligned averages and their synaptic interactions were identified by cross-correlograms of action potentials. The possibility that synchronized firing between cortical cells could mediate spike-correlated effects in the SpTA of EMG was examined in several ways. Sixty-two pairs consisted of one CM cell and a non-CM cell; 15 of these had correlogram peaks of the same magnitude as that of other pairs, but the synchrony peaks did not mediate any postspike effect from the non-CM cell. Twelve pairs of simultaneously recorded CM cells were cross-correlated. Half had features (usually synchrony peaks) in their cross-correlograms and the cells of these pairs also shared some target muscles in common. The other half had flat correlograms and, {{in most of these}} pairs, the CM cells affected different muscles. The latter group included pairs of CM cells that facilitated synergistic muscles. These results indicate that common synaptic input specifically affects CM cells that have overlapping muscle fields.

The {{purposes of this study}} were to examine the between-limbs difference in reflex contraction latency of the hamstring muscles in patients with unilateral ACLD and to investigate its relationship with instability and function. Fifty patients with arthroscopically diagnosed unilateral ACLD were measured bilaterally for reflex hamstring contraction latency (RHCL), and 20 normal volunteers were similarly tested. The subjects were measured in a position of single-limb full weight-bearing with the knee flexed 30 degrees. An anteriorly directed shear force was applied to the tibia, and surface <b>electromyographs</b> (EMGs) recorded the activity of the hamstrings in response to the applied force. The latency of contraction was defined as the time from initial tibial movement, identified by accelerometry, to the onset of increased hamstring EMG activity. Both legs were tested and a between-limbs difference was computed. A significant difference in RHCL was found between the limb with ACLD and the control limb. The mean RHCL of the limb with ACLD was nearly double that of the unaffected limb, for a significant mean between-limbs difference (p < 0. 05). The mean between-limbs difference for the control subjects was not statistically significant. The conclusion is that patients with ACLD have an increased RHCL of the injured leg. As the RHCL is dependent on proprioceptive activity around the joint, it {{can be used as a}} measure of proprioceptive ability. The loss of the neurophysiological protective reflex involving the anterior cruciate ligament and hamstrings in patients with ACLD is likely to be a contributory factor in the decreased joint stability experienced by these patients...|$|R

40|$|The {{process by}} which an animal is able to {{elaborate}} an immune response against its own tissues is thought to underlie a number of degenerative disorders. One system which may provide insight into this phenomenon is experimental myasthenia gravis (EMG) 1 (1). Laboratory animals immunized with purified nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) produce anti-receptor antibodies and often develop myasthenia (2). Characteristics shared by human myasthenics and myasthenic animals include: muscular weakness and flaccid paralysis which is aggravated by exercise and relieved by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, hypersensitivity to curare, low amplitude miniature endplate potentials, decrementing compound muscle action potentials in <b>electromyographs,</b> simplification of the postsynaptic membrane at the neuromuscular junction, {{and the presence of}} circulating antibodies reactive with autologous AChR (3 - 6). Although many studies have detailed the consequences of anti-AChR antibodies binding at the neuromuscular junction, less attention has been focused on the mechanisms regulating the induction, maintenance, and suppression of the anti-AChR immune response. The present investigation describes murine EMG which, in principle, will permit these mechanisms to be examined. Mice have several distinct advantages over animals previously studied (rabbit [1], rat [7, 8], guinea pig [7], and monkey [9]). The immune system of the mouse is better characterized than that of any other animal, and the availability of inbred, congenic, and recombinant strains permit genetic analysis. Different functional subclasses of lymphocytes can be distinguished by antisera against cell surface antigens. Finally methodology exists for the selective manipulation of the mouse immune system. Another advantage of the mouse EMG system derives from the availability of several mouse muscle cell lines. In the studies described, use is made of the mouse nonfusing muscle cell line BC 3 H- 1 (10). This cell line is a rich source of mouse AChR (11, 12) and is well suited for use as a target tissue in in vitro studies of the mouse anti-AChR immune response...|$|R
