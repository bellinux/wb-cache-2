5|$|Despite the game's <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> resources, reviewers {{felt that}} the game's visuals were only marginally—if at all—better than for {{contemporary}} games, such as the previous year's Banjo-Kazooie. In fact, IGN felt that Donkey Kong 64 was not as pretty as Banjo-Kazooie, especially in its water and backgrounds, though it still ranked among the console's prettiest games. The setting is barren and nondescript at first, and only later introduces lighting effects and richer textures. IGN hoped for more from Rare, and while its reviewer praised the game's particle effects (e.g., in the desert wind), he considered the game's dynamic lighting overused. N64 Magazine said that the enhanced effects were most often used for decoration, though they also played some role in puzzles based on illuminating paths. Reviewers noted graphical difficulties even with the extra memory, such as frame rate slowdowns and distant features not appearing in any detail, though overall they considered the added graphical flourishes commendable. GameSpot also saw a lack of variety in the game's environment.|$|E
5|$|The first EC-137 {{made its}} maiden flight on 9 February 1972, with the fly-off {{between the two}} radars taking place during March–July that year. Favorable test results led to the {{selection}} of Westinghouse's radar for the production aircraft. Hughes's radar was initially {{thought to be a}} certain winner, simply because much of its design was also going into the new F-15 Eagle's radar program. The Westinghouse radar used a pipelined fast fourier transform (FFT) to digitally resolve 128 Doppler frequencies, while Hughes's radars used analog filters based on the design for the F-15 fighter. Westinghouse's engineering team won this competition by using a programmable 18-bit computer whose software could be modified before each mission. This computer was the AN/AYK-8 design from the B-57G program, and designated AYK-8-EP1 for its much <b>expanded</b> <b>memory.</b> This radar also multiplexed a beyond-the-horizon (BTH) pulse mode that could complement the pulse-Doppler radar mode. This proved to be beneficial especially when the BTH mode is used to detect ships at sea when the radar beam is directed below the horizon.|$|E

40|$|Cache {{and memory}} {{compression}} {{systems have been}} developed for improving memory system performance of high-performance parallel computers. Cache compression systems can reduce onchip cache miss rate and off-chip memory traffic by storing and transferring cache lines in compressed form, while memory compression systems can <b>expand</b> main <b>memory</b> capacity by storing memory pages in compressed form. However, these systems have not been quantitatively evaluated on an identical condition, making it difficult to understand the performance of a new system relative to the existing systems. In this paper, we provide an identical execution-driven simulation environment for these systems. To the best of our knowledge, none has been evaluated the performance of cache and memory compression systems by using an execution-driven simulator. Experimental results show that cache compression systems reduce cache miss rate by 16 % and memory traffic by 30 %, while it <b>expands</b> <b>memory</b> capacity by less than 160 %. The results also show that memory compression systems significantly <b>expand</b> <b>memory</b> capacity by over 270 %. Based on these experimental analyses, we finally provide future research directions on the compression systems...|$|R

25|$|Windows 2.0 was {{released}} in December 1987, and was more popular than its predecessor. It features several improvements to the user interface and memory management. Windows 2.03 changed the OS from tiled windows to overlapping windows. The result of this change led to Apple Computer filing a suit against Microsoft alleging infringement on Apple's copyrights. Windows 2.0 also introduced more sophisticated keyboard shortcuts and could make use of <b>expanded</b> <b>memory.</b>|$|E
25|$|The first PC {{operating}} systems to integrate such technology were Compaq DOS 3.31 (via CEMM) and Windows/386 2.1, both released in 1988. Since the 80286 version of Windows 2.0 (Windows/286), Windows applications {{did not suffer}} from the 640 KB barrier. Prior to DOS extenders, if a user installed additional memory and wished to use it under DOS, they would first have to install and configure drivers to support either <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> specification (EMS) or extended memory specification (XMS).|$|E

25|$|The {{protected}} mode of the 80286 was not utilized until {{many years after}} its release, {{in part because of}} the high cost of adding extended memory to a PC, but also because of the need for software to support the large user base of 8086 PCs. For example, in 1986 the only program that made use of it was VDISK, a RAM disk driver included with PC DOS 3.0 and 3.1. A DOS could utilize the additional RAM available in {{protected mode}} (extended memory) either via a BIOS call (INT 15h, AH=87h), as a RAM disk, or as emulation of <b>expanded</b> <b>memory.</b> The difficulty lay in the incompatibility of older real-mode DOS programs with protected mode. They simply could not natively run in this new mode without significant modification. In protected mode, memory management and interrupt handling were done differently than in real mode. In addition, DOS programs typically would directly access data and code segments that did not belong to them, as real mode allowed them to do without restriction; in contrast, the design intent of protected mode was to prevent programs from accessing any segments other than their own unless special access was explicitly allowed. While it was possible to set up a protected-mode environment that allowed all programs access to all segments (by putting all segment descriptors into the GDT and assigning them all the same privilege level), this undermined nearly all of the advantages of protected mode except the extended (24-bit) address space. The choice that OS developers faced was either to start from scratch and create an OS that would not run the vast majority of the old programs, or to come up with a version of DOS that was slow and ugly (i.e., ugly from an internal technical viewpoint) but would still run a majority of the old programs. Protected mode also did not provide a significant enough performance advantage over the 8086-compatible real mode to justify supporting its capabilities; actually, except for task switches when multitasking, it actually yielded only a performance disadvantage, by slowing down many instructions through a litany of added privilege checks. In protected mode, registers were still 16-bit, and the programmer was still forced to use a memory map composed of 64kB segments, just like in real mode.|$|E
2500|$|Windows 2.1 was {{released}} in two different versions: Windows/286 and Windows/386. Windows/386 uses the virtual 8086 mode of the Intel 80386 to multitask several DOS programs and the paged memory model to emulate <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> using available extended memory. Windows/286, {{in spite of its}} name, runs on both Intel 8086 and Intel 80286 processors. It runs in real mode but can make use of the high memory area.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} {{versions of}} SpeedScript {{were designed for}} the 40-column Commodore 64 and the 22-column VIC-20. When the Commodore 128 was released, featuring an 80-column display, many users requested {{an updated version of}} SpeedScript {{to take advantage of this}} new capability. In June 1986, Compute!'s Gazette published SpeedScript-80, a short patch for SpeedScript 3.0 or higher, which enabled the use of the VDC's new 80-column capabilities on a Commodore 128 running in 64 mode. However, this did not take advantage of the C128's <b>expanded</b> <b>memory,</b> and a few minor commands were eliminated due to the alterations to the existing code. [...] SpeedScript-80 was enhanced soon after with SpeedScript-80 Revisited, by Bob Kodadek.|$|E

50|$|The MicroVAX II {{supported}} 1 to 16 MB {{of memory}} through zero, {{one or two}} memory expansion modules. The MS630 memory expansion module was used for <b>expanding</b> <b>memory</b> capacity. Four variants of the MS630 existed: the 1 MB MS630-AA, 2 MB MS630-BA, 4 MB MS630-BB and the 16MB MS630-CA. The MS630-AA was a dual-height module, whereas the MS630-BA, MS630-BB and MS630-CA were quad-height modules. These modules used 256 Kb DRAMs and were protected by byte-parity, with the parity logic located on the module. The modules connected to the CPU module via the backplane through the C and D rows and a 50-conductor ribbon cable. The backplane served as the address bus and the ribbon cable as the data bus.|$|R
50|$|Intel {{processors}} {{from the}} 386 onward allowed a virtual 8086 mode, which simplified the hardware required to implement <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> for DOS applications. <b>Expanded</b> <b>memory</b> managers such as Quarterdeck's QEMM product and Microsoft's EMM386 supported the <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> standard without requirement for special memory boards.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Expanded</b> <b>memory</b> is an {{umbrella}} term for several incompatible technology variants. The {{most widely used}} variant was the <b>Expanded</b> <b>Memory</b> Specification (EMS), which was developed jointly by Lotus Software, Intel, and Microsoft, so that this specification was {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "LIM EMS." [...] LIM EMS had several versions. The first widely implemented version was EMS 3.2, which supported up to 8 MB of <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> and uses parts of the address space normally dedicated to communication with peripherals (upper memory) to map portions of the <b>expanded</b> <b>memory.</b> EEMS, an <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> management standard competing with LIM EMS 3.x, was developed by AST Research, Quadram and Ashton-Tate; it could map any area of the lower 1 MB. EEMS ultimately was incorporated in LIM EMS 4.0, which supported up to 32 MB of <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> and provided some support for DOS multitasking as well. IBM however created its own <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> standard called XMA.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Expanded</b> <b>Memory</b> Specification or EMS is the {{specification}} {{describing the}} use of <b>expanded</b> <b>memory.</b> EMS functions are accessible through software interrupt 67h.

5000|$|Allocation {{and use of}} <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> was not {{transparent}} to application programs.

Although applications could use <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> with relative freedom, many other software components such as drivers and TSRs were still normally constrained to reside within the 640K [...] "conventional memory" [...] area, which soon became a critically scarce resource.|$|E
50|$|The name EMM386 {{was used}} for the <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> {{managers}} of both Microsoft's MS-DOS and Digital Research's DR-DOS, which created <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> using extended memory on Intel 80386 CPUs. There also is an EMM386.EXE available in FreeDOS.|$|E
50|$|IBM {{developed}} their own memory standard called <b>Expanded</b> <b>Memory</b> Adapter (XMA); the IBM DOS driver for it was XMAEM.SYS. Unlike EMS, the IBM expansion boards could be addressed both using an <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> model and as extended memory. The <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> hardware interface used by XMA boards is however incompatible with EMS. A XMA2EMS.SYS driver provided however EMS emulation for XMA boards. XMA boards were first introduced for the 1986 (revamped) models of the 3270 PC.|$|E

50|$|Later, some {{motherboard}} chipsets of Intel 80286-based computers implemented an <b>expanded</b> <b>memory</b> {{scheme that}} did not require add-on boards, notably the NEAT chipset.
