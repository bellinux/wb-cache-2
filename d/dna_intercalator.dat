50|$|There {{are several}} ways {{molecules}} (in this case, also known as ligands) can interact with DNA. Ligands may interact with DNA by covalently binding, electrostatically binding, or intercalating. Intercalation occurs when ligands of an appropriate size and chemical nature fit themselves in between base pairs of DNA. These ligands are mostly polycyclic, aromatic, and planar, and therefore often make good nucleic acid stains. Intensively studied <b>DNA</b> <b>intercalators</b> include berberine, ethidium bromide, proflavine, daunomycin, doxorubicin, and thalidomide. <b>DNA</b> <b>intercalators</b> are used in chemotherapeutic treatment to inhibit DNA replication in rapidly growing cancer cells.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that caffeine can act as an antimutagen and inhibit the cytoxic and/or cytostatic effects of some DNA intercalating agents. It has been suggested that this inhibitory effect may be due to complexation of the <b>DNA</b> <b>intercalator</b> with caffeine. In this study we employ optical absorption, fluorescence, and molecular modeling techniques to probe specific interactions between caffeine and various DNA intercalators. Optical absorption and steady-state fluorescence data demonstrate complexation between caffeine and the planar <b>DNA</b> <b>intercalator</b> acridine orange. The association constant of this complex is determined to be 258. 4 +/- 5. 1 M- 1. In contrast, solutions containing caffeine and the nonplanar <b>DNA</b> <b>intercalator</b> ethidium bromide show optical shifts and steady-state fluorescence spectra indicative of a weaker complex with an association constant of 84. 5 +/- 3. 5 M- 1. Time-resolved fluorescence data indicate that complex formation between caffeine and acridine orange or ethidium bromide results in singlet-state lifetime increases consistent with the observed increase in the steady-state fluorescence yield. In addition, dynamic polarization data indicate that these complexes form with a 1 : 1 stoichiometry.

During this process, DNA undergoes significant structural rearrangements, first lengthening before relaxing to a shorter DNA-ligand complex in the intermediate state to form a molecular lock.

40|$|Many anticancer drugs, such as {{doxorubicin}} (DXR), intercalate into nuclear DNA {{of cancer}} cells, thereby inhibiting their growth. However, {{it is not}} well understood how such drugs interact with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Using cell and molecular studies of cultured cells, we show that DXR and other <b>DNA</b> <b>intercalators,</b> such as ethidium bromide, can rapidly intercalate into mtDNA within living cells, causing aggregation of mtDNA nucleoids and altering the distribution of nucleoid proteins. Remodelled nucleoids excluded DXR and maintained mtDNA synthesis, whereas non-remodelled nucleoids became heavily intercalated with DXR, which inhibited their replication, thus leading to mtDNA depletion. Remodelling was accompanied by extensive mitochondrial elongation or interconnection, and was suppressed in cells lacking mitofusin 1 and optic atrophy 1 (OPA 1), the key proteins for mitochondrial fusion. In contrast, remodelling was significantly increased by p 53 or ataxia telangiectasia mutated inhibition (ATM), indicating a link between nucleoid dynamics and the genomic DNA damage response.

40|$|Changes in {{methylation}} of promoter {{or first}} exon may mimic {{the effect of}} mutations of various tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) or proto- oncogene. Repression of various genes during malignant transformation is due to CpG island hypermethylation and chromatin remodeling. Transcriptional-silencing {{is due to the}} Hypermethylation of promoter of various TSGs. However, hypomethylation of regulatory DNA sequences activates transcription of proto-oncogene, retrotransposons, as well as genes encoding proteins involved in genomic instability and malignant cell metastasis. The methylation of genomic DNA in malignant cells is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases DNMT 1. DNA methylation can be induced by the tobacco-specific carcinogen NNK. The role of DNMT 1 -mediated methylation in tobacco carcinogenesis remains unclear. In a human lung cell line, glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK 3 β) phosphorylatedDNMT 1 to recruit β-transducin repeat–containing protein (βTrCP), resulting in DNMT 1 degradation, and that NNK activated AKT, inhibiting GSK 3 β function and thereby attenuating DNMT 1 degradation. Chemotherapy using <b>DNA</b> <b>intercalators</b> {{is one of the most}} successful approaches to cancer treatment. Induction of apoptosis in tumor cells is due t <b>DNA</b> <b>intercalators</b> that are believed to inhibit DNA polymerases and topo-isomerases,.

Global hypomethylation in the absence of DNMT 1 down-regulation is apparent in non-primate placentas and invitro derived human cyto-trophoblast stem cells, suggesting that DNMT 1 down-regulation is not an absolute requirement for genomic hypomethylation in all instances.

40|$|The {{cytotoxic}} {{mechanism of}} selected anthracene-containing, DNA-intercalating antitumor agents (azonafides) was investigated. The hypothesis tested {{was that these}} compounds kill tumor cells via poisoning DNA topoisomerase II (TOPO II). This hypothesis was based on observations that similar <b>DNA</b> <b>intercalators</b> poison TOPO II as a contributing mechanism to their cytotoxicity. The agents studied had nuclear effects similar to other <b>DNA</b> <b>intercalators.</b> The azonafides inhibited DNA and RNA synthesis with lesser effects on protein synthesis. They produced DNA damage consistent with TOPO II poisoning, including single strand breaks, double strand breaks and DNA/protein crosslinks. Of the five analogs studied, the two with the greatest cytotoxic potency produced less DNA damage than the other analogs. Furthermore, the DNA damage produced by these two highly toxic analogs did not correlate with their cytotoxic potencies whereas the DNA damage production by the less toxic analogs did. This observation suggests {{that there may be}} disparate mechanisms of toxicity among the azonafides. All analogs studied inhibited the activity of purified TOPO II. However, {{there was no evidence of}} TOPO II poisoning in these experiments. Intracellular TOPO II poisoning assays revealed that only two of the five analogs poisoned TOPO II. This suggests that TOPO II poisoning is involved in the mechanism of action of some azonafide analogs. However, like other <b>DNA</b> <b>intercalators,</b> there may be alternate, possibly novel, mechanisms involved in their toxicity. Additional studies investigated the effect of metabolism on the activity of the parent compound (azonafide). Four metabolites resulting from in vitro metabolism of azonafide were identified including two desmethyl species, an N-oxide metabolite and a carboxylic acid metabolite. The two desmethyl species retained cytotoxic activity and inhibited TOPO II, but were less potent than the parent. The N-oxide and carboxylic acid metabolites were inactive in cytotoxicity analyses. These findings show that metabolism of azonafide represents a deactivation pathway and not a bioactivation scheme...|$|R

The first chapter {{describes the}} synthesis and evaluation of compounds for use in nuclide therapy. Carboranes are frequently used in the development of drugs for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy. New routes for monohydroxylation at the B and C atoms of p-carborane have been developed. The Suzuki-Miyaura reaction has been applied to the cross-coupling of bis(neopentyl glycolato) diboron or bis(pinacolato) diboron and 2 -I-p-carborane. The synthesized derivatives are important intermediates in the synthesis of a number of potentially biologically active carborane-containing molecules. The <b>DNA</b> <b>intercalator</b> doxorubicin has been functionalized to enable 125 I labelling. The aim of combining the <b>DNA</b> <b>intercalator</b> with 125 I was to achieve high delivery of cytotoxic radiation to the nucleus. The DNA-binding ability and cellular uptake of the synthesized compounds have been evaluated. One of the compounds bound strongly to DNA and had similar cellular uptake as daunorubicin, which makes the compound very interesting for further biological evaluation. The second chapter describes the use of polypeptide conjugates to broaden our knowledge of molecular recognition. The polypeptides consist of 42 amino acids each and are designed to fold into helix-loop-helix motifs that dimerize due to their amphiphilic character.
