40|$|The term {{complexity}} derives etymologically {{from the}} Latin plexus, which means interwoven. Intuitively, {{this implies that}} something complex is composed by elements {{that are difficult to}} separate. This difficulty arises from the relevant interactions that take place between components. This lack of separability is at odds with the classical scientific method - which has been used since the times of Galileo, Newton, Descartes, and Laplace - and has also influenced philosophy and engineering. In recent decades, the scientific study of complexity and complex systems has proposed a paradigm shift in science and philosophy, proposing novel methods that take into account relevant interactions.

40|$|It’s {{just over}} a month until the UK general {{election}} and many Brits {{seem to have lost}} trust in their traditional politicos. Whether it’s the UK Independence Party (UKIP) scapegoating the European Union and immigrants, a rise in nationalism (the Scottish National party), or Russell Brand’s teenage anarchism, faith in facile, and sometimes ugly, solutions is on the march. It’s a huge relief, therefore, to hear that the editors of the DSM (the main reference book for psychiatric classification), are considering a new category of disorder to cover this condition. Clearly many critical things have been said about the burgeoning amount of psychiatric diagnosis, here and elsewhere. However, I’ve just looked at the DSM <b>draft</b> <b>entry</b> (reproduced below), and think that this time, the American Psychiatric Association might really be onto something.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} a {{model of}} community collaborative research in which the linguist aligns documentary research with the needs and linguistic capacities of a community {{that is trying to}} reverse language shift. The linguist working on a grammar of the language responds to community topics and questions as they arise. At the same time, the writing of the grammar crucially involves members of the community as assistants. We discuss one project of this type, where the goal is the production of a grammar designed for use both by linguists and members of the community. This follows in the growing tradition of writing high quality reference grammars which can be used by speakers of that language (c. f. Valentine 2001). A community reference grammar for Inuktitut has as its primary goal that the grammar be broad ranging in topics, extending beyond the pages of inflectional paradigms which characterize most grammars of this language. Issues such as WH questions and how quantifiers are used will be included. A second goal is that the grammar be of immediate and direct use to the community. In order to ascertain that the grammar is readable and therefore useable by members of the community, the linguist must obtain feedback from language professionals (translators, language teachers, curriculum developers) within the community. This is done through the internet, where draft sections of the grammar are posted. Assistants have been hired to serve as readers and liaison to the other interested members of the community. This has two secondary purposes. Errors or omissions in the discussion are caught; the online drafts serve as a catalyst for discussion about language within the community and on the radio. A linguist is unlikely to be aware of what language professionals within the community actually need and want to know at any particular moment. In one recent case the linguist was asked to identify a set of elements. These elements are possessive suffixes which have a complex set of portmanteau features, including a) person and number of possessor, b) number of possessum and c) case. There is also some slight variation within the community. The question led to a <b>draft</b> <b>entry</b> on this topic, which is being read by the liaison assistants. In this manner, the construction of a reference grammar is one intersecting piece in the overall community effort to reverse language shift...|$|E
