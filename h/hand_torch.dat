25|$|The {{process of}} making the large open end (bell) of a brass {{instrument}} is called metal beating. In making the bell of, for example, a trumpet, a person lays out a pattern and shapes sheet metal into a bell-shape using templates, machine tools, handtools, and blueprints. The maker cuts out the bell blank, using hand or power shears. He hammers the blank over a bell-shaped mandrel, and butts the seam, using a notching tool. The seam is brazed, using a torch and smoothed using a hammer or file. A draw bench or arbor press equipped with expandable lead plug is used to shape and smooth the bell and bell neck over a mandrel. A lathe is used to spin the bell head and to form a bead {{at the edge of}} bell head. Previously shaped bell necks are annealed, using a <b>hand</b> <b>torch</b> to soften the metal for further bending. Scratches are removed from the bell using abrasive-coated cloth.|$|E

5|$|A {{shortage}} of 9mm ammunition for the Owen Guns was discovered, apparently because the ammunition {{was in the}} LST {{that had not been}} completely unloaded. An emergency airdrop was requested at 10:30. In Port Moresby, the 1st Air Maintenance Company prepared 30 parachutes, each attached to two boxes containing 2,560 rounds of 9mm ammunition, a total of 153,600 rounds. This was loaded onto three USAAF B-24 Liberator bombers at Wards Airfield that took off at 16:55. They arrived over the Finschhafen area after dark at 19:15, where a drop zone in a Kunai patch was marked by men holding <b>hand</b> <b>torches.</b> Of the 115,000 rounds that were dropped, about 112,000 were recovered.|$|R

2500|$|At [...] a Condor {{appeared}} to shadow the convoy and a Martlet chased it away before returning {{for lack of}} fuel. In the afternoon a Martlet spotted two U-boats and the convoy made an emergency turn. The U-boats were forced to submerge and Martlets patrolled overhead keeping them down until having to return when low on fuel. It was so dark that the aircraft were guided to the flight deck with <b>hand</b> <b>torches</b> and again the night was quiet. On 21 December, 802 NAS could only keep three Martlets operational, take-off and landing was dangerous in the heavy swell and the pilots were very tired. After the last patrol, the commander of Audacity ordered the ship out of the convoy [...] to the starboard as usual but no escorts could be spared. At [...] a ship {{at the rear of}} the convoy was torpedoed and nearby ships fired snowflakes, illuminating the area to both sides. Gerhard Bigalk in U-751 saw the silhouette of Audacity at close range and at [...] torpedoed Audacity which began to sink at the stern. Two more torpedoes from U-571 hit the escort carrier, a big explosion blew off the front end and the ship began to sink at the head. Audacity sank head first at [...] west of Cape Finisterre.|$|R
60|$|So {{she rode}} {{on all that}} day also till as the sun began to sink, from a hill whereon grew large {{euphorbia}} trees, on a plain backed by mountains, she saw the town surrounded by a fence, inside of which were thousands of huts, that in their turn surrounded a great open space. Now they pushed forward quickly, and as darkness fell approached the main gate of the place, where, as usual, {{there was no one}} to be seen. But here they did not enter, marching on till they came to another gate, that of the Intunkulu, the King's house, where, their escort done, the regiment turned and went away, leaving Rachel alone with the envoy, Tamboosa, who still led the white ox. They entered this gate, and presently came to a second. It was that of the Emposeni, the Dwelling of the King's wives, out of which appeared women crawling on the ground before Rachel, and holding in their left <b>hands</b> <b>torches</b> of grass. These undid the baggage from the ox, and at their signals, for they did not seem to dare to speak to her, Rachel dismounted. Thereon Tamboosa saluted her, and taking the horse by the bridle, led it away with the ox.|$|R
6000|$|When father became {{convinced}} that the book had actually been suppressed, {{he tried to get}} the fact into the newspapers; but his communications were ignored. At a political meeting of the socialists, where many reporters were present, father saw his chance. He arose and related the history of the suppression of the book. He laughed next day when he read the newspapers, and then he grew angry to a degree that eliminated all tonic qualities. The papers made no mention of the book, but they misreported him beautifully. They twisted his words and phrases away from the context, and turned his subdued and controlled remarks into a howling anarchistic speech. It was done artfully. One instance, in particular, I remember. He had used the phrase [...] "social revolution." [...] The reporter merely dropped out [...] "social." [...] This was sent out all over the country in an Associated Press despatch, and {{from all over the country}} arose a cry of alarm. Father was branded as a nihilist and an anarchist, and in one cartoon that was copied widely he was portrayed waving a red flag at the head of a mob of long-haired, wild-eyed men who bore in their <b>hands</b> <b>torches,</b> knives, and dynamite bombs.|$|R
