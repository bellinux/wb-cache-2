25|$|Although {{the firm}} still served the textile industry, Murray began to {{consider}} how the design of steam engines could be improved. He wanted to make them simpler, lighter, and more compact. He also wanted the steam engine to be a self-contained unit that could readily be assembled on site with pre-determined accuracy. Many existing engines suffered from faulty assembly, which took much effort to correct. One problem that Murray faced was that James Pickard had already patented the crank and flywheel method of converting linear motion to circular motion. Murray ingeniously got round this difficulty by introducing a hypocycloidal gear. This consisted of a large fixed ring with internal teeth. Around the inside of this ring a smaller gear wheel, with half the outer one's diameter, would roll driven by the piston rod of the steam engine, which {{was attached to the}} gear's rim. As the piston rod moved backwards and forwards in a straight line, its linear motion would be converted into circular motion by the gear wheel. The gear wheel's bearing was attached to a crank on the <b>flywheel</b> <b>shaft.</b> When he used the hypocycloidal gear he was able to build engines that were more compact and lightweight than previous ones. However, Murray ceased to use this type of motion as soon as Pickard's patent expired.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Adding {{a fourth}} {{rotational}} axis can {{solve the problem}} of gimbal lock, but it requires the outermost ring to be actively driven so that it stays 90 degrees out of alignment with the innermost axis (the <b>flywheel</b> <b>shaft).</b> Without active driving of the outermost ring, all four axes can become aligned in a plane as shown above, again leading to gimbal lock and inability to roll.|$|E
50|$|The large {{vertical}} blowing engine illustrated {{was built}} in the 1890s by E. P. Allis Co. of Milwaukee (later to form part of Allis-Chalmers). The air pumping cylinder is above the steam power cylinder and crosshead. The main force of the piston is transmitted to the air cylinder by a purely reciprocating action and the flywheels are there merely to smooth the action of the engine. The <b>flywheel</b> <b>shaft</b> is mounted below the steam piston, the paired connecting rods driving downwards and backwards.|$|E
50|$|The gearbox input <b>shaft,</b> <b>flywheel</b> {{and engine}} backing plate were {{changed with the}} advent of the five-main-bearing engine in 1965. Therefore, the {{transmission}} for a three-main-bearing engine (1962-1964) differed from its later counterpart.|$|R

50|$|Like {{the beam}} engines, the main {{force of the}} piston is {{transmitted}} to the air cylinder by a purely reciprocating action and the flywheels are there merely to smooth {{the action of the}} engine. To permit adjustment though, the steam piston rod only goes as far as the crosshead and above this there are twinned rods to the air piston. The <b>flywheel</b> <b>shaft</b> is mounted below the steam piston, the paired connecting rods driving downwards and backwards to make this a return connecting rod engine.|$|E
5000|$|Another special was the NCB Gyro or Electrogyro Locomotive. Based on a [...] 4-wheeled 0-4-0 frame {{fitted with}} two [...] "gyro units" [...] (see Flywheel energy storage) made by Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon of Switzerland. The gyros were principally a 3ton {{horizontal}} flywheel enclosed in a vessel filled with low pressure hydrogen. A vertically mounted three-phase squirrel-cage electric motor/generator was directly coupled to each <b>flywheel</b> <b>shaft.</b> The motor took its power from a side-mounted supply at static posts via a four-contact swinging arm extended or retracted pneumatically by the driver. Power {{could only be}} taken whilst the loco was stationary alongside one of these posts. When the gyros had reached the required speed, the driver would retract the contact arm, switch the motor to generation and controlled the locomotive {{in a similar way}} to a diesel-electric loco. Charging posts had to be strategically placed around the site. A contact arm was provided {{on each side of the}} locomotive, although it is not clear if posts were installed on one or both sides of the track. Each gyro operated between 3,000rpm when fully 'charged;' and 1,800rpm before recharging. Recharging took 2minutes and the locomotive could work for around 30 minutes before recharging. It weighed 34tons and had a maximum speed of 15 mph.|$|E

This, in effect, slid backwards and forwards admitting steam to one end of the cylinder then the other. Matthew Murray improved the working of these valves by driving them with an eccentric gear attached to the rotating shaft of the engine.|$|E
50|$|The drive {{between the}} {{crankshafts}} was unusual. Rather {{than the typical}} geared drive, as used by the Jumo, there was a triangular coupling rod frame, driven by an overhung crank {{on the end of}} each crankshaft. This frame in turn drove the <b>flywheel</b> and output <b>shaft.</b> The frame also drove the fuel injection pump, mounted in the top vee between the cylinders.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{thick-walled}} composite cylinders in structural applications {{has seen}} tremendous {{growth over the}} last decade. Applications include pressure vessels, <b>flywheels,</b> drive <b>shafts,</b> spoolable tubing, and production risers. In these applications, the geometry of a composite cylinder is axisymmetric {{but in many cases}} the applied loads are non-axisymmetric and more rigorous analytical tools are required for an accurate stress analysis. A closed-form solution is presented for determining the layer-by-layer stresses, strains, and displacements and first-ply failure in laminated composite cylinders subjected to non-axisymmetric loads. The applied loads include internal and external pressure, axial force, torque, axial bending moment, uniform temperature change, rotational velocity, and interference fits. The formulation is based on the theory of anisotropic elasticity and a state of generalized plane deformation along the axis of the composite cylinder. Parametric design trade studies can be easily and quickly computed using this closed-form solution. A computer program that was developed for performing the numerical calculations is described and results from specific case studies are presented...|$|R
40|$|Abstract â€“ The {{ring-shaped}} hydrogen plasma of ASDEX Upgrade (AUG), {{an experimental}} tokamak for nuclear fu-sion research, carries an electric current up to 1. 4 MA. The generation and magnetic confinement of the plasma current requires an electric power {{of several hundred}} MVA for short time periods (up to 10 s). To keep away the pulsed load from the public utility grid, the power and energy is pro-vided by separate networks based on flywheel generators. Voltage distortions measured on the 10. 5 kV busbars were increased by resonances caused by the subtransient reac-tance of one generator and the stray capacitance of the transmission cables. The shape of the busbar voltages could be significantly improved by a simple modification of exist-ing static var compensators. The dynamic load curves of feedback controlled fusion experiments feature frequencies which {{are in the same}} range as the first eigenfrequency of the <b>flywheel</b> generator <b>shaft</b> lines (about 25 Hz). In order to protect the generators from subsynchronous resonances (SSR) torque sensors were installed. The paper presents simulated and measured results and describe the measures taken to achieve a significant reduction of torsional stresses in the generator shaft lines...|$|R
40|$|Abstract::- This paper {{addresses}} {{the development and}} performance of a Human Powered Flywheel Motor (HPFM) operated forge cutter. This set-up is used to cut crop residues like maize stovers, sorghum stovers in dry condition. This cut stovers can be fed to cattle directly. The current practice by small livestock farmers is to cut stover manually by axe or machetes. The mechanized cutters also available which are hand operated as well as electric motor driven. But today there is severe power shortage in country like India, particularly in rural and remote area. It is convergent {{to the fact that}} the hand muscles are weaker than leg muscles. The concept of human powered flywheel motor is used to develop the pedal operated forge cutter. In this set-up flywheel is used as a motor or a store for energy. The operator pumps the energy into flywheel by pedaling bicycle- drive mechanism with a speed rising gear pair. After a one minute pedaling is stopped, and then <b>flywheel</b> <b>shaft</b> is connected to cutter shaft. The stored energy is enough to operate cutter effectively and efficiently. The test performance of developed cutter shows the remarkable improvements over hand operated forage cutter...|$|E
40|$|Theory and {{simulation}} results {{have demonstrated that}} four, variable speed flywheels could potentially provide the energy storage and attitude control functions of existing batteries and control moment gyros (CMGs) on a satellite. Past modeling and control algorithms {{were based on the}} assumption of rigidity in the flywheel?s bearings and the satellite structure. This dissertation provides {{simulation results}} and theory which eliminates this assumption utilizing control algorithms for active vibration control (AVC), <b>flywheel</b> <b>shaft</b> levitation and integrated power transfer and attitude control (IPAC) that are effective even with low stiffness active magnetic bearings (AMB), and flexible satellite appendages. The flywheel AVC and levitation tasks are provided by a multi input multi output (MIMO) control law that enhances stability by reducing the dependence of the forward and backward gyroscopic poles with changes in flywheel speed. The control law is shown to be effective even for (1) Large polar to transverse inertia ratios which increases the stored energy density while causing the poles to become more speed dependent and, (2) Low bandwidth controllers shaped to suppress high frequency noise. These two main tasks could be successfully achieved by MIMO (Gyroscopic) control algorithm, which is unique approach. The vibration control mass (VCM) is designed to reduce the vibrations of flexible appendages of the satellite. During IPAC maneuver, the oscillation of flywheel spin speeds, torque motions and satellite appendages are significantly reduced compared without VCM. Several different properties are demonstrated to obtain optimal VCM. Notch, band-pass and low-pass filters are implemented in the AMB system to reduce and cancel high frequency, dynamic bearing forces and motor torques due to flywheel mass imbalance. The transmitted forces and torques to satellite are considerably decreased in the present of both notch and band-pass filter stages. Successful IPAC simulation results are presented with a 12 [%] of initial attitude error, large polar to transverse inertia ratio (IP / IT), structural flexibility and unbalance mass disturbance. Two variable speed control moment gyros (VSCMGs) are utilized to demonstrate simultaneous attitude control and power transfer instead of using four standard pyramid configurations. Launching weights including payload and costs can be significantly reduced...|$|E
40|$|The ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) tokamak {{requires}} an electrical power up {{to a few}} hundred MVA for a time period of 10 â€“ 20 s. The power and energy is provided by three separate networks based on flywheel generators. In 1999, during a routine check performed on generator EZ 3, {{it was discovered that}} coupling bolts of the <b>flywheel</b> generator <b>shaft</b> were deformed. Given that the active load of the generator (~ 100 MW) in service is well below the design value of the shaft (~ 800 MW), the damages may only be explained by a torsional resonance of the shaft line, itself excited by active power transients from the converter loads. A value of 23. 6 Hz was calculated for the first eigen-frequency of the shaft line. Frequencies between 10 and 30 Hz have been identified in the spectrum of the load curves. Since torsional shaft oscillations are characterised by very low damping, torsional resonance can become dangerous even for over-dimensioned generator shafts. Therefore, a novel `torque' measurement system was installed. The paper presents results from calculations and measurements showing that devices capable to measure the stress in the shaft line are essential for generator protection in feedback controlled fusion experiments...|$|R
40|$|The {{enhancement}} {{of the early}} design stages, {{in the production of}} aeronautical engines, has been shown decisive, for developing efficient and reliable final products. Nevertheless, in most of industrial engineering design problems, the amount of design variables is large. Moreover, several nonlinearities characterize the behaviour of the physical phenomena involved and the derivatives are seldom known for all the functions. Besides, objective functions exhibit several local extremes, whereas the designer as well as the practitioner is usually interested in the global one. In this context, stochastic and evolutionary optimization have been shown capable to provide reliable solutions while keeping the computational cost at a reasonable level. Existing tools for the design and optimization of engine components deal with the optimal and detailed design of specific engine components, thus requiring several computational time and efforts to gain optimized design parameters. Hence, existing tools fit for later design phases. Conversely, this paper proposes an integrated design and optimization environment, for automatically designing optimal aeronautical piston engine configuration, still in the conceptual design stage. The optimization is performed using the MATLAB genetic algorithm (GA) toolboxÃ‚Â®, while the automatic design of the optimized components is carried out in cascade to the optimization phase. In particular, a single-objective GA is used to evaluate the optimal dimensions of engine components related to motion, namely: crankshaft, connecting rods and screws, <b>flywheel,</b> propeller <b>shaft</b> and torsional vibration damper. For testing the efficiency of the integrated environment, the conceptual design of components of a 4 -in-line Diesel aeronautical piston engine is proposed, starting from an existing similar engine. Results show a reduction of the 20 Ã‚Â % of weight of the crankshaft in comparison to the original configuration. The proposed environment seems to be a promising tool for a fast and reliable conceptual design of piston engines for aeronautical purposes...|$|R
40|$|The {{design for}} a human powered battery charger was {{analyzed}} and a redesign was proposed. The original product was designed in the MIT ME course 2. 009 to power a LED projector {{that will be used}} to teach literacy classes in Mali. The goals of the new design are to decrease the cost and usability of the alpha prototype, producing a minimum of 60 W that is required to provide a 10 : 1 use to charge ratio for the 6 W projector. The alpha prototype utilizes a modified rowing motion to move a device produces power through a constant force spring, a small motor. A voltage regulator safely charges the battery using the voltage output of the motor. The rowing motion requires a number of moving parts and expensive components and although the complex motion combines the power available from the leg and arm muscles, the movement is not simple to understand or particularly comfortable to use. A model was created to test a proposed redesign that simplifies the product in several areas. The new design will use the arm muscles only to provide the necessary power and will avoid costs by making the charger a stationary product. The model is made of a recoil spring and pulley mechanism mounted to a freewheel, which turns a <b>shaft</b> and <b>flywheel.</b> The <b>shaft</b> would then be connected to a motor to charge the battery in a similar manner to that of the alpha prototype. (cont.) The experiments performed and calculations on the model provided information that suggests that a flywheel based design does provide sufficient power for a 60 W output. Further research will be needed to accurately ascertain the cost of a product and whether it can be manufactured for under $ 50. Preliminary analysis suggests {{that it is possible to}} meet both the cost and power requirements of the product. by Lisa Chandler. Thesis (S. B.)

5000|$|Being {{much shorter}} than the {{predominant}} multiple units, electric locomotives can suffer from a problem known as [...] "gapping" [...] - becoming marooned between supplies at breaks in the electrical supply and snatching at the couplings whilst moving as they come {{on and off the}} power. The latter places undue stress on couplings and has been known to cause separations of a train. Raworth overcame this by having a motor-generator set (booster) with a large <b>flywheel</b> on the <b>shaft</b> between the two. The traction current, instead of feeding the traction motors directly through the control assembly, powered a large motor which turned a <b>shaft</b> with the <b>flywheel</b> and fed into the generator. The output of the generator could be combined with the 3rd rail power to reduce or boost the voltage applied to the traction motors. With the generator output polarity reversed, the control assembly could deliver around 1200 V DC by combining the generator output with the 650 V from the 3rd rail to give positive 650 V and negative 500-600 V - leading to the nickname [...] "boosters". The flywheel ensured the generator continued to turn whilst no current was available from the 3rd rail, thus ensuring a continuous supply to the traction motors.|$|R
40|$|This work {{involves}} {{the development of}} a new actuation system for high speed valves. The valve actuation system proposed in this work, named as energy coupler actuator (ECA), is to couple the translational valve components (poppet or spool) with a kinetic energy source (pump/motor <b>shaft,</b> <b>flywheel,</b> and etc.). The coupling system can allow dynamic coupling or decoupling to control the valve position. An ECA using a MR fluid coupling was selected to develop the first prototype of an energy coupler actuated valve (ECAV). MR fluid offers many advantages such as symmetric actuation performance to allow high pressure at either port, large and scalable actuation force, proportional control, long stroke in a short time and small moving mass. A unique contribution of this work is the development of valve models, which integrate the finite-element analysis (2 D, 2 D axisymmetric and 3 D) and 1 D lumped parameter equations. A multi-physics coupled model for an ECAV system was also developed using this method. The simulation study based on this model was performed to analyze the significant design parameters including dimensional parameters and operating parameters, resulting in two optimal design solutions of an ECA. A prototype ECA was fabricated based on one of the design solutions. The experimental testing of this prototype showed that it is capable of reaching the target 1. 5 mm stroke, equivalent to a 100 L/min @ 5 bar according to a CFD solution, within 3 ms. Moreover, a 7 mm long stroke was achieved in just 7 ms. The measurement results corresponded with the simulation results, validating the multi-physics model developed for this prototype ECA. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{rural areas}} of many countries, the supply of {{electricity}} has always been scarce due to the relative isolation from the national electricity distribution system. In New Zealand for example, many high country farm houses rely almost entirely on diesel generating sets for power. This method of power generation costs more than urban electricity supply. However, a recent advance in control technology, and a new turbine concept have shown that very small hydro power schemes also known as microhydro, can now produce urban quality electricity at a cost not much greater than urban supply. Through research and testing a 5 kW microhydro generating set was developed. The design of the micro hydro generating set involves the utilisation of the latest control technology, and proprietary components. The single most important contribution {{to the development of}} the microhydro generating set was the use of an electronic load governor with the run-of-the-river principle which results in constant flow operation of the turbine. This eliminates the need for a precision speed governor and accurate turbine flow control and thus greatly simplifies the turbine design. A malfunction protection system and a load management system have also been incorporated to allow maximum utilisation of the power output without risk of damage to the generating equipment. The use of a Delphi electronic load governor in conjunction with a brushless, self excited and self regulated synchronous generator have produced a stable electrical output of 5 kW at 230 V, 50 Hz, AC, when using an appropriate <b>flywheel</b> to provide <b>shaft</b> inertia to dampen out electrical transients. It was found that shaft inertia of four times that recommended by the governor manufacturer, was required. One of the simplest turbines is a centrifugal pump operating in the reverse mode. Tests have shown that centrifugal pumps perform exceptionally well as power recovery turbines, with efficiencies similar or in some cases even greater than that for the pumping case without any modification. Consequently, the combination of well established mechanical and control hardware, simplifies the design and installation of a microhydro scheme to a technical task rather than one requiring the expertise of a design engineer. A set of five machines was designed, covering the range of heads and flows most commonly encountered in hilly isolated areas. The operating conditions cover heads ranging from 30 m to 150 m and flows ranging from 30 l/s to 10 l/s respectively...|$|R
