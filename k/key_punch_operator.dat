50|$|Though no perfect {{method to}} {{quantify}} the increase in revenue can be relied upon, yet there are clear evidences which suggested that substantial increase in revenue was registered due to improved custom processes. I will quote only one instance. Before WeBOC the exemption of withholding tax was used to be granted on submitting hard copy of exemption certificate to the PRAL <b>key</b> <b>punch</b> <b>operator,</b> who entered that number manually and importer used to get exemption. A large number of fake exemption certificates were detected in the past. In WeBOC system the exemption and concessions were being entered on line by the Commissioner (IRS). Commissioner Withholding Tax, Karachi had acknowledged the fact in a meeting that in new automated system collection of withholding tax at import stage had increased more than 15-20% (to the tune of 15-20 billion rupees) after its implementation. A chunk of this amount is attributed to automation.|$|E

Hackers are by no means a new threat and have routinely featured in news stories during the last two decades. Indeed, they have become the traditional ‘target’ of the media, with the standard approach being to present the image of either a ‘teenage whiz kid’ or an insidious threat.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to analyze the 1973 and 1975 {{vocational}} business and office education graduates trained in the intensive office laboratory, the data processing laboratory, and the cooperative office education programs in Region VI of the State of Indiana. Tables were constructed to display aggregate and detailed data pertaining to: 1. employment status of graduates 2. reasons for graduate unemployment 3. length of time graduates have beenemployed 4. satisfaction of the graduates withcurrent employment 5. perception of the graduates of thehigh school vocational programs 6. number of graduates continuing posthigh school training 7. type of institutions serving thegraduates post high school trainingneeds 8. occupational classification of the employed vocational business and office education graduates 9. graduate participation in the Office Education Association. So that the {{purpose of the}} study could be met, all 577 vocational business and office education graduates were surveyed. The data was based on a return of 365 questionnaires or a 68. 9 per cent return. A questionnaire was developed and field tested. After the graduates returned the questionnaire, questionnaires were mailed to the employers of the graduates employed in an office occupation to determine the validity of the data collected. Some of the findings are: 1. Sixty-nine per cent of the graduates were employed, twenty per cent were not seeking employment, and eleven per cent were seeking employment. 2. Over seventy-six per cent of the employed graduates were employed in office occupations and fifty-three per cent were still employed in the first employment position. 3. Fifty-four per cent of the employed graduates were employed within the same geographic area where the vocational training was provided and forty-six per cent had been employed longer than thirteen months. 4. Seventy-one per cent of the unemployed graduates had been employed since graduation. 5. Twenty per cent of the employed cooperative office education graduates and twenty per cent of the intensive office education graduates were employed as secretaries. 6. Twelve per cent of the data processing graduates were employed as computer operators and twelve per cent as <b>key</b> <b>punch</b> <b>operators.</b> 7. Fifteen per cent of the employed graduates and forty-three per cent of the unemployed graduates were enrolled in post high school training. Based on the data, some of the conclusions are: 1. The vocational programs currently underway must be meeting the needs of the graduates since more than ninety per cent of all vocational business and office education graduates within Region VI have been employed. 2. Vocational programs are training students for employment positions which meet the desires of graduates since more than seventy-five per cent of the respondents working in office occupations were satisfied with the current employment position. 3. The vocational programs must be providing the necessary training within the current vocational business and office education programs since more than ninety per cent of the graduates working in office positions indicated that they were adequately prepared for the position. Following are some of the recommendations of the study: 1. A comprehensive longitudinal follow-up study should be conducted on the vocational graduates that follows the progression of the graduatesin and out of the labor market and post-secondary education institutions. 2. Follow-up studies should be conducted every one and three years and a standard questionnaire should be adopted by the Indiana State Department of Public Instruction. 3. A follow-up study should be conducted with the employers of the vocational graduates to ascertain the extent of employer satisfaction with the job competence and performance of the graduates.

25|$|A {{keypunch}} is {{a device}} for manually entering data into punched cards by precisely punching holes at locations {{designated by the}} keys struck by the operator. Early keypunches were manual devices. Later keypunches were mechanized, often resembling a small desk, with a keyboard similar to a typewriter, and with hoppers for blank cards and stackers for punched cards. In 1901, Herman Hollerith invented and patented the mechanical <b>key</b> <b>punch</b> that was operated by keys, like a typewriter, and that advanced the card automatically to the next column after each punch. Later models would be motor driven with rudimentary programming features.|$|R

50|$|Some early {{keypunch}} machines used {{a keyboard}} with 12 labeled <b>keys</b> to <b>punch</b> the correct holes in paper cards.

Before fitting the tape to the caster it is turned over so that the first holes read on each line set {{the width of the}} variable space. The subsequent holes determine the position of a frame, or die case, that holds the set of matrices for the face being used. Each matrix is a rectangle of copper recessed with the shape of the letter. Once the matrix is positioned over the mould that forms the rest of the piece of type being cast, molten type metal is injected.|$|R
