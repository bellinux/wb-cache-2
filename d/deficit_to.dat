5|$|Ferrari's team orders {{caused them}} to be fined $100,000 by the race {{stewards}} but avoided further punishment from the FIA World Motor Sport Council in September 2010. The result meant Alonso reduced the points <b>deficit</b> <b>to</b> be 13 behind Vettel in the Drivers' Championship, while leader Lewis Hamilton extended his advantage over teammate Jenson Button by two points.

McLaren maintained their lead in the Constructors' Championship although Red Bull's finish of third and sixth meant they reduced the gap by one point. Ferrari's one-two result allowed them to reduce the points <b>deficit</b> <b>to</b> Red Bull slightly. Mercedes and Renault remained in fourth and fifth positions, with eight races left in the season.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this paper is to {{investigate}} the long-run causal relationship between budget and trade <b>deficits</b> empirically <b>to</b> see if they are really twins. The Ricardian equivalance hypothesis states that in theory there exists no causal relationship between the two. According to Keynesian view however there is a causal channel from budget <b>deficits</b> <b>to</b> trade <b>deficits.</b> In the empirical literature, the evidence is mixed. This work employs the cointegration analysis with error correction modeling to test both the existence of long-run relationship and causality issues. The evidence presented in this paper is mainly in favor of the Keynesian twin deficit hypothesis. It also suggests two way causality, not only running from budget <b>deficits</b> <b>to</b> trade <b>deficits</b> but also the other way round...|$|R

5|$|Despite {{entering}} the crisis {{with a low}} level of public debtroughly 40% of GDPand a moderate deficit compared to many European nations, the UK's ability to take discretionary fiscal action was limited by the burden of bank bail-outs on public finances. The tax revenue from financial services, which was conservatively estimated at 13.9% of UK tax income in 2007, fell alarmingly as the crisis affected bank profits. This contributed to a significant rise in the <b>deficit</b> <b>to</b> an estimated £175billion (12.4% of GDP) in 2009–10 and a rise in the national debt to above 80% of GDP at its peak. The UK had significant automatic stabilisers which contributed far more than discretionary action and more than most other countries.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the third}} period Eric Staal tied the game at seven with his first goal of the game. Minutes later Duchene got a breakaway, but before he could take a shot, Ovechkin threw his stick at the puck, {{resulting}} in the first penalty shot in All-Star game history, and only the third penalty assessed during the past ten years of All-Star competition. Duchene took the shot against Henrik Lundqvist, who stopped the attempt. Kris Letang scored shortly after the penalty shot to give back the lead to Team Staal. Briere scored a little over a minute later assisted by Weber and Henrik Sedin to re-tie the game. Weber's assist was his fourth of the game making him the second defenceman in history to record four assists in an All-Star Game (Ray Bourque, 1985). Team Lidstrom added two more goals before Rick Nash scored to cut the <b>deficit</b> <b>to</b> one. With about {{a minute and a half}} left in the game, Team Staal pulled their goaltender for the extra attacker. The decision backfired as Eriksson scored on the empty net with 1:11 remaining. Eric Staal scored with 33.6 seconds remaining to bring his team back within one goal, but they failed to get another shot on goal before time ran out. By coming back from a four-goal <b>deficit</b> <b>to</b> win the game Team Lidstrom set the record for biggest comeback victory in All-Star history. Lidstrom finished the game with a +7 rating, the highest rating since 1991 when Adam Oates was also a +7 for the Wales Conference. Tim Thomas earned the victory becoming the first goaltender to win three straight All-Star Games. Patrick Sharp was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) after registering one goal and two assists in a losing cause for Team Staal. The combined 21 goals was the fourth highest total in NHL All-Star Game history.|$|E

40|$|Fiscal deficits {{have been}} at the {{forefront}} of macroeconomic adjustment in the 1980 s, both in developing and developed countries. Fiscal deficits were blamed in good part for the assortment of ills that beset developing countries in the 1980 s: over-indebtedness leading to the debt crisis beginning in 1982, high inflation, and poor investment and growth performance. This paper will examine the evidence for the macroeconomic effects of fiscal deficits, using the results of a set of ten case studies done for the Bank research project,"The Macroeconomics of Public Sector Deficits. "The ten cases were Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Morocco, Mexico, Pakistan, Thailand and Zimbabwe. The authors first present a summary of the stylized facts on fiscal adjustment. Then the results are presented of the decomposition of the deficit in the case studies. The results of the case studies are then used <b>to</b> relate <b>deficits</b> <b>to</b> macro economic imbalances: first by analyzing the relationship of <b>deficits</b> <b>to</b> private consumption and investment; and second by examining the relationship of <b>deficits</b> <b>to</b> external imbalances. While macroeconomic imbalances are clearly interrelated, the authors assume the effects of such an interrelationship are small and use a sequence of partial equilibrium analysis of each type of imbalance.
