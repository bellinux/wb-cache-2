40|$|A {{comparison}} between main design methods for unpaved roads {{is presented in}} this paper. An unpaved road {{is made up of}} an unbound aggregate base course lying on a usually weak subgrade. A geosynthetic might be put between the two in reinforcing and separating function. The goal of a design method is to find the appropriate thickness of the base course knowing at least traffic volume, wheel load, tire pressure, undrained cohesion of the subgrade, allowable rut depth and influence of the reinforcement. Geosynthetics can reduce the thickness or the quality of aggregate required and improve the durability of an unpaved road. Geotextiles contribute to save aggregate <b>through</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>friction</b> and separation, while geogrids through interlocking between his apertures and lithic base elements. In the last chapter a case study is discussed and design thicknesses with two design methods for the three possible cases (i. e. unreinforced, geotextile reinforced, geogrid reinforced) are calculated...|$|R

40|$|An {{unstructured}} grid {{storm surge}} {{model of the}} west coast of Britain, incorporating a high-resolution representation of the Mersey estuary is used to examine storm surge dynamics in the region. The focus of the study is the major surge that occurred during the period 11 - 14 November 1977, which has been investigated previously using uniform grid finite difference models and a finite element model of {{the west coast of}} Britain. However, none of these models included the Mersey estuary. Comparison of solutions in the eastern Irish Sea with those computed with these earlier models showed that, away from the Liverpool Bay region, the inclusion of the Mersey estuary had little effect. However, {{at the entrance to the}} Mersey, its inclusion did influence the solution. By including a detailed representation of the Mersey estuary within the model, it was possible to conduct a detailed study of storm surge propagation in the Mersey, which had never previously been performed. This detailed study showed for the first time that the surge's temporal variability within the estuary is influenced by surge elevation at its entrance. This varies with time as a function of spatial and temporal variations of wind stress over the west coast of Britain. Within the Mersey, calculations show that the spatial variability is mainly determined by changes in bottom topography, which had not been included in earlier finite difference models. However, since water depth is influenced by variations in tidal elevation, this, together with tide surge <b>interaction</b> <b>through</b> bottom <b>friction</b> and momentum advection, influences the surge. The ability of the finite element model to vary the mesh in near-shore regions to such an extent that it can resolve the Mersey and hence the impact of the Mersey estuary upon the Liverpool Bay circulation shows that it has distinct advantages over earlier finite difference models. In the absence of detailed measurements within the Mersey at the time of the surge, it was not possible to validate predicted surge elevations within the Mersey. However, significant insight into physical processes influencing the surge propagation down the estuary, its reflection and spatial/temporal variability could be gained...|$|R

40|$|A {{paradigm}} for isothermal, mechanical rectification of stochastic fluctuations is introduced in this paper. The central {{idea is to}} transform energy injected by random perturbations into rigid-body rotational kinetic energy. The prototype considered in this paper is a mechanical system consisting {{of a set of}} rigid bodies in <b>interaction</b> <b>through</b> magnetic fields. The system is stochastically forced by white noise and dissipative <b>through</b> mechanical <b>friction.</b> The Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution at a specific temperature defines the unique invariant measure under the flow of this stochastic process and allows us to define ``the temperature'' of the system. This measure is also ergodic and weakly mixing. Although the system does not exhibit global directed motion, it is shown that global ballistic motion is possible (the mean-squared displacement grows like t squared). More precisely, although work cannot be extracted from thermal energy by the second law of thermodynamics, it is shown that ballistic transport from thermal energy is possible. In particular, the dynamics is characterized by a meta-stable state in which the system exhibits directed motion over random time scales. This phenomenon is caused by interaction of three attributes of the system: a non flat (yet bounded) potential energy landscape, a rigid body effect (coupling translational momentum and angular momentum <b>through</b> <b>friction)</b> and the degeneracy of the noise/friction tensor on the momentums (the fact that noise is not applied to all degrees of freedom).

5000|$|The {{interacting}} molecular {{structures that}} break {{the structure of}} solvent exchange the heat or the oscillations or the electron clouds on weakening cohesive force (CF) of solvent. However the solvent structure opposes the interaction of solute molecules to maintain its own structures. Thus the friction and triction both are developed. The triction depicts a thermodynamic restriction to break down or disrupt the solvent structure by solute interaction. Contrary to the triction the friction depicts a molecular force restriction. The thermodynamic disruption of solvent structure leads to develop intermolecular forces (IMF). Friccohesity of solute solvent interactions predicts a quantitative disruption of CF and formation of IMF in the same proportion. Thus the friccohesity is kinetic concept materialized <b>through</b> <b>friction</b> and triction both. Thus in solubilization or dispersion sciences the friccohesity predicts a level of solute and solvent <b>interaction</b> <b>through</b> molecular <b>interaction</b> engineering. Friccohesity becomes a most mobile theory to accommodate the geometrical spaces to support the electronic contact between the similar molecules with definite CF and dissimilar molecules or distributing force factor or friction to overcome opposing resistance. The friccohesity becomes a modern model to simulate not only the molecular contact but also successful exchange of the interacting activities in terms of activation energy, entropy, and Gibbs energy defined by triction.|$|R
