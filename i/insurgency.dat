5|$|Beato, who {{had covered}} {{military}} operations in India and China, was probably attracted by {{the news of the}} annexation. While he arrived in Burma after the main military operations ended, he would still get {{to see more of the}} action, as the annexation by the British led to an <b>insurgency</b> which lasted for the following decade. This allowed Beato to take a number of pictures of British military in operations or at the Royal Palace, Mandalay, as well as <b>insurgency</b> soldiers and prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{disbanding}} of the camps, {{the defeated}} {{forces of the}} former regime continued a cross-border <b>insurgency</b> campaign into Rwanda from North Kivu. The insurgents maintained a presence in Rwanda's north western provinces and were supported by the predominantly Hutu population, {{many of whom had}} lived in the refugee camps before they were attacked. In addition to supporting the wars in the Congo, Kagame began a propaganda campaign to bring the Hutu to his side. He integrated former soldiers of the deposed genocidal regime's military into the RPF-dominated national army and appointed senior Hutu to key local government positions in the areas hit by <b>insurgency.</b> These tactics were eventually successful; by 1999, the population in the north west had stopped supporting the <b>insurgency</b> and the insurgents were mostly defeated.|$|E
5|$|Having been {{promoted}} to lieutenant general in November 2008, Dutton succeeded Army Lieutenant General Jonathon Riley as Deputy Commander of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan, a position he occupied until November 2009.

McChrystal, then overall commander of troops in the country, formulate a new strategy to combat the <b>insurgency,</b> which included {{an increase in the}} number of troops. Dutton was succeeded in his post at ISAF by Lieutenant General (later General Sir) Nick Parker at the end of 2009.|$|E

40|$|Since the Second World War, {{there has}} been a shift away from interstate warfare to a {{relative}} increase in intra-state conflict and <b>insurgencies.</b> In addition, a growing number of these <b>insurgencies</b> can be described as ‘transnational’, in that they are supported by outside state and non-state actors and may also pursue activities beyond their borders. This thesis attempts to analyse and explain the shift from interstate warfare to the emergence of transnational <b>insurgencies.</b> This study proposes and evaluates two possible explanations. First, interstate warfare is thought by many scholars to be declining in value as changing technology, economic systems, and domestic and international politics have raised the costs and constraints of interstate warfare while yielding reduced benefits. Second, there is evidence that transnational <b>insurgencies</b> are more effective and possess wider capabilities than domestic <b>insurgencies</b> by utilising transnational networks for external support, strategic alliances, and illicit activities. The study evaluates whether these factors have deterred interstate warfare while incentivising indirect methods through the initiation or support of transnational <b>insurgencies.</b> This thesis first reviews indirect warfare and the development of <b>insurgencies</b> over history and, in particular, how they have qualitatively changed since 1945 in their transnational relationships and activities. It then provides a theoretical and empirical analysis of the changing value of direct interstate warfare and the strategies and calculus by which states outsource to <b>insurgencies</b> as an alternative to interstate warfare. Third, it reviews the transnational networks and the changing effectiveness and capabilities of transnational <b>insurgencies.</b> Finally, it concludes with a case study of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, examining the decision and outcome of state outsourcing to Afghan <b>insurgencies</b> (i. e. the Northern Alliance) ...|$|R

5|$|By late 1996, Hutu militants {{from the}} camps were {{launching}} regular cross-border incursions, and the RPF-led Rwandan government launched a counteroffensive. Rwanda provided troops and military training to the Banyamulenge, a Tutsi {{group in the}} Zairian South Kivu province, helping them to defeat Zairian security forces. Rwandan forces, the Banyamulenge, and other Zairian Tutsi, then attacked the refugee camps, targeting the Hutu militia. These attacks caused {{hundreds of thousands of}} refugees to flee; many returned to Rwanda despite the presence of the RPF, while others ventured further west into Zaire. The defeated forces of the former regime continued a cross-border <b>insurgency</b> campaign, supported initially by the predominantly Hutu population of Rwanda's north western provinces. By 1999, a programme of propaganda and Hutu integration into the national army succeeded in bringing the Hutu to the government side and the <b>insurgency</b> was defeated.|$|E

5000|$|The {{internal}} conflict in Myanmar began after the country's independence in 1948, as successive central governments of Myanmar (or Burma) fought myriad ethnic and political rebellions. Some {{of the earliest}} <b>insurgencies</b> were by Burmese-dominated [...] "multi-colored" [...] leftists, and by the Karen National Union (KNU).

Luthor tries to use the kryptonite weapon to kill Superman, but Shazam (Joey Naber) stops him, allowing Superman to execute him.

5|$|Questions then arose {{among the}} U.S. {{administration}} and military leadership {{as to the}} best method by which Hanoi (the perceived locus of the <b>insurgency)</b> could be dissuaded from its course of action. The answer seemed to lie {{in the application of}} air power. By 1964 most of the civilians surrounding President Lyndon B. Johnson shared the Joint Chiefs of Staff's collective faith in the efficacy of strategic bombing to one degree or another. They reasoned that a small nation like North Vietnam, with a tiny industrial base that was just emerging after the First Indochina War, would be reluctant to risk its new-found economic viability to support the <b>insurgency</b> in the south. Constantly affecting this decision-making process were fears of possible counter moves or outright intervention by the Soviet Union, the PRC, or both. The civilians and the military were divided, however, on the manner of affecting Hanoi's will to support the southern <b>insurgency.</b> The civilians thought in terms of changing the regime's behavior while the military men were more concerned with breaking its will.|$|E

5|$|Some {{academics}} {{suggest that}} the <b>insurgency</b> in Kashmir is at least partly {{a result of the}} manner in which it was integrated into India. Kashmir, uniquely amongst princely states, was not required to sign either a Merger Agreement or a revised Instrument of Accession giving India control over a larger number of issues than the three originally provided for. Instead, the power to make laws relating to Kashmir was granted to the Government of India by Article 5 of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir and was, under Article 370 of the Constitution of India, somewhat more restricted than in relation to other states. Widmalm argues that during the 1980s, a number of Kashmiri youth began to feel that the Indian government was increasingly interfering in the politics of Jammu and Kashmir. The elections of 1987 caused them to lose faith in the political process and begin the violent <b>insurgency</b> which is still ongoing. Similarly, Ganguly suggests that the policies of the Indian government towards Kashmir meant that the state, unlike other parts of India, never developed the solid political institutions associated with a modern multi-ethnic democracy. As a result, the growing dissatisfaction with the status quo felt by an increasingly politically aware youth was expressed through non-political channels which Pakistan, seeking to weaken India's hold over Kashmir, transformed into an active <b>insurgency.</b>|$|E
