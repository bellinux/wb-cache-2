Only Phase 1 A was funded by DOE and executed by Honeywell. The major objectives of Phase 1 A of the project included: (1) Sensor validation and operation of fast-response PM and NOx sensors; (2) Control system modeling of low-pressure EGR controls, development of control strategies, and initial evaluation of these models and strategies for EGR control in diesel engines; (3) Sensor testing to understand applicability of fast-response PM sensors in determining loading rates of the particle trap; and (4) Model validation and sensor testing under steady-state and transient operational conditions of actual engines. In particular, specific objectives included demonstration of: (1) A PM sensor response time constant (T 10 - T 90) of better than 100 milliseconds (msec); (2) The ability to detect PM at concentrations from 0. 2 to 2 Bosch smoke number (BSN) or equivalent; (3) PM sensor accuracy to within 20 % BSN over the entire range of operation; and (4) PM sensor repeatability to within 10 % over the PM entire sensor range equivalent to a BSN of 0. 2 to 2...|$|R
