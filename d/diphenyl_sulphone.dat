Several drugs, including isonicotinyl hydrazide (isoniazid), diamino <b>diphenyl</b> <b>sulphone</b> (dapsone), hydralazine, and some sulphonamides, are meta-bolised by the liver enzyme acetyl transferase. There is individual {{variation in the}} rate at which acetylation occurs and two phenotypes, rapid and slow, are usually recognised, which show an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.

40|$|The cure {{kinetics}} of triglycidyl p-amino phenol (TGAP) {{epoxy resin}} with a diamine (4, 4 -diamino <b>diphenyl</b> <b>sulphone</b> [DDS]), reinforced with montmorillonite (MMT), {{has been studied}} by differential scanning calorimetry. The isothermal cure reaction consists of two parts: a rapid intra-gallery reaction, attributed to homopolymerization of the TGAP catalyzed by the MMT and the extra-gallery cross-linking reaction of the TGAP with the DDS. Increasing cure temperature promotes the intra-gallery reaction, which should promote an exfoliated nanostructure; this is confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. These results indicate that this system (TGAP/DDS/MMT) is an excellent candidate for achieving exfoliated polymer-layered silicate nanocomposites and identifies a protocol for optimizing the degree of exfoliation.

40|$|Wood-based {{epoxy resin}} was {{synthesized}} from resorcinol-liquefied wood. First, wood components were depolymerized and liquefied by reaction with resorcinol. The resorcinol-liquefied wood {{with plenty of}} hydroxyl groups could {{be considered as a}} precursor for synthesizing wood-based epoxy resin. Namely, the phenolic-OH groups of the liquefied wood reacted with epichlorohydrine under alkali condition. By the glycidyl etherification, epoxy functionality was introduced to the liquefied wood. The wood-based epoxy resin was cured with 4, 4 ’- diamino <b>diphenyl</b> <b>sulphone</b> (DDS) and the thermal and mechanical properties were evaluated. The flexural modulus and strength of the cured wood-based epoxy resin were comparable to those of the petroleum-based bisphenol-A type epoxy resin (diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A: DGEBA). The mechanical and adhesive properties of the wood-based epoxy resins suited well for matrix resins of fiber reinforced composites. Therefore, biomass composites consist of ramie fibers and the wood-based epoxy resin were fabricated. The flexural modulus and strength of the biomass composites were equivalent to those of the same fiber reinforced bisphenol-A type epoxy composites...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} of molecular models of crosslinked polymers {{is an area}} of some difficulty and considerable interest. We report here a new method of constructing these models and validate the method by modelling three epoxy systems based on the epoxy monomers bisphenol F diglycidyl ether (BFDGE) and triglycidyl-p-amino phenol (TGAP) with the curing agent diamino <b>diphenyl</b> <b>sulphone</b> (DDS). The main emphasis of the work concerns the improvement of the techniques for the molecular simulation of these epoxies and specific attention is paid towards model construction techniques, including automated model building and prediction of glass transition temperatures (T(g)). Typical models comprise some 4200 - 4600 atoms (ca. 120 - 130 monomers). In a parallel empirical study, these systems have been cast, cured and analysed by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) to measure T(g). Results for the three epoxy systems yield good agreement with experimental T(g) ranges of 200 - 220 °C, 270 - 285 °C and 285 - 290 °C with corresponding simulated ranges of 210 - 230 °C, 250 - 300 °C, and 250 - 300 °C respectively...|$|E

In 16 % in which the dilator muscle could be detected, it was atrophic, and in 11 % the pigmented epithelium was thinned and atrophic. Cellular inflammatory infiltrations were seen in 88 % of all specimens. They were mostly slight in eyes which before operation had been without posterior synechiae of the iris. In most of the eyes in which posterior synechiae had been present moderate or heavy inflammatory cell infiltrates composed of lymphocytes and plasma cells, often associated with macrophages, neutrophils, or eosinophils, were found.

40|$|The use of poly(ethylene-co-methacrylic acid) (EMAA) as an {{efficient}} and repeatable thermally activated healing agent {{in a high}} performance diglycidyl ether of bis phenol A (DGEBA) /diethyl toluene diamine (DETDA) mendable epoxy composite is presented. Despite curing above the melting point of EMAA (Tm = 85 °C), healing was facilitated by incorporating a preliminary low temperature curing step of 5 h at 80 °C, prior to epoxy cure at 150 °C. Healing was subsequently shown to occur at 130 °C, 150 °C and 200 °C via a pressure delivery mechanism derived from a condensation reaction between EMAA and the residual hydroxyl groups formed during epoxy cure. Healing was repeatable over 5 healing cycles despite a gradual reduction in efficiency, while efficiency increased with increasing healing temperature. Importantly, healing was evident at 130 °C, despite the epoxy network remaining in the glassy state at this temperature (Tg = 150 - 158 °C). As well as creating high performance mendable composites based upon DGEBA/DETDA, EMAA particles distributed evenly {{on the surface of}} the crack plane were found to enhance mode I interlaminar fracture toughness by up to 200 % for both DETDA and 4, 4 diamino <b>diphenyl</b> <b>sulphone</b> (44 DDS) systems...|$|E

The results obtained from DSC were applied to autocatalytic and diffusion controlled kinetic models. The reaction mechanism broadly showed autocatalytic behaviour regardless {{of the presence of}} PEEK-T. At higher PEEK-T concentration, more diffusion controlled mechanism was observed. The rate of curing reaction decreased with increase in thermoplastic content and also with the lowering of curing temperature. The activation energies of the blends are higher than that of the neat resin. The blends showed a phase separated morphology. The dispersed phase showed a homogeneous particle size distribution. The T-g of the neat resin decreased with the decrease in cure temperature. Two T-g's corresponding to the epoxy rich and thermoplastic rich phases were observed in the dynamic mechanical spectrum. The storage modulus of 10 and 20 phr PEEK-T blends are found to be greater than the neat resin. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to determine whether the ductility and toughenability of a highly cross-linked epoxy resin, which has a high glass transition temperature, Tg, can be enhanced by the incorporation of a ductile thermoplastic resin. Diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A (DGEBA) cured by diamino <b>diphenyl</b> <b>sulphone</b> (DDS) was used as the base resin. Polyethersulphone (PES) was used as the thermoplastic modifier. Fracture toughness and shear ductility tests were performed to characterize the materials. The fracture toughness of the DDS-cured epoxy was not enhanced by simply adding PES. However, in the presence of rubber particles as a third component, the toughness of the PES–rubber-modified epoxy was found to improve with increasing PES content. The toughening mechanisms were determined to be rubber cavitation, followed by plastic deformation of the matrix resin. It was also determined, through uniaxial compression tests, that the shear ductility of the DDS-cured epoxy was enhanced by the incorporation of PES. These results imply that the intrinsic ductility, which had been enhanced by the PES addition, was only activated under the stress state change due to the cavitation of the rubber particles. The availability of increasing matrix ductility seems to be responsible for the increase in toughness...|$|E
40|$|The {{isothermal}} cure of {{a highly}} reactive tri-functional epoxy resin, tri-glycidyl para-amino phenol (TGAP), with diamino <b>diphenyl</b> <b>sulphone</b> (DDS), at two different cure temperatures Tc has been studied by both conventional differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and by a stochastic temperature modulated DSC technique, TOPEM. From a series of isothermal cure experiments for increasing cure times, the glass transition temperature Tg {{as a function of}} isothermal cure time is determined by conventional DSC from a second (non-isothermal) scan, and the vitrification time tv is obtained as the time at which Tg = Tc. In parallel, TOPEM experiments at the same Tc lead directly to the determination of tv from the sigmoidal change in the quasi-static heat capacity. It is not possible to identify the glass transition temperature of the fully cured system, Tg∞, in a third scan by conventional DSC. In contrast, with TOPEM a second (non-isothermal) scan at 2 K/min after the isothermal cure gives rise to three separate transitions: devitrification of the partially cured and vitrified material; almost immediate vitrification as the Tg of the system again rises; finally another devitrification, at a temperature approximating closely to Tg∞. Thus with TOPEM it is possible to obtain a calorimetric measure of the glass transition temperature of this fully cured system. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E

Then, {{by analyzing the}} chromatograms of gaseous low-temp oxidation products and GC/MS of the extractable matter of the oxidation residue, we summarizing the mechanism of low-temp sulfur model compound oxidation. The results show that between 30 °C to 80 °C, the interaction between diphenyl sulfide and oxygen is mainly one of physical adsorption. After 80 °C, chemical adsorption and chemical reactions begin. The main reaction mechanism in the low-temp oxidation of the model compound diphenyl sulfide is diphenyl sulfide generates diphenyl sulfoxide, and then this sulfoxide is further oxidized to <b>diphenyl</b> <b>sulphone.</b> A small amount of free radicals is generated in the process. The model compound cysteine behaves differently from diphenyl sulfide. The main reaction low-temp oxidation mechanism involves the thiol being oxidized into a disulphide and finally evolving to sulfonic acid, along with SO 2 being released at 130 °C and also {{a small amount of}} free radicals. We also conducted an experiment on coal from Xingcheng using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results show that the major forms of organic sulfur in the original coal sample are thiophene and sulfone. Therefore, it can be inferred that there is none or little mercaptan and thiophenol in the original coal. After low-temp oxidation, the form of organic sulfur changes. The sulfide sulfur is oxidized to the sulfoxide, and then the sulfoxide is further oxidized to a sulfone, and these steps can be easily carried out under experimental conditions. What’s more, the results illustrate that oxidation promotes sulfur element enrichment on the surface of coal...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{heterogeneous}} oxidation of N-(2 -phenylthioethyl) benzamide in a {{dispersion of}} water was performed with twice {{the amount of}} hydrogen peroxide at 60 C for 72 h as a model reaction of the oxidation of poly(amide-sulphide) (polymer 1), and the corresponding N-[2 -(phenylsulphoxy) -ethyl]benzamide and N-[2 -(phenylsulphonyl) ethyl]benzamide were ob-tained in 5 % and 95 % yields respectively. This suggests that the alkyl phenyl sulphide group was easily oxidized with time via the alkyl phenyl sulphoxide group into the alkyl phenyl sulphone group. On the other hand, when heterogeneous oxidation of diphenyl sulphide in a dispersion of water was carried out with twice the amount of hydrogen peroxide at 60 C for 72 h, the cor-responding diphenyl sulphoxide and <b>diphenyl</b> <b>sulphone</b> were obtained in 77 % and 23 % yields, respectively. Therefore, the oxidation rate of the diphenyl sulphide group was much slower {{than that of the}} alkyl phenyl sulphide group, and the heterogeneous oxidation of diphenyl sulphide with excess hydrogen peroxide in a dispersion of water primarily produced diphenyl sulphoxide under the same conditions. On the basis of these model reactions, the heterogeneous oxidation of polymer 1, which was prepared by the polyaddition of bis(4 -mercaptophenyl) sulphide with m-phenylenebis(2 -oxazoline), was performed with one to three times the amount of hydrogen peroxide in a dispersion of water at 60 C, and the Tg of the resulting polymers gradually increased with reaction time from 111 C to 165 C. When the oxidization was carried out with three times the amount of hydrogen peroxide for 48 h, the polymer with major structure, poly(amide-sulphone) (polymer 3), was obtained. Polymer 3 was also easily prepared by the oxidization of polymer 1 with equivalent amounts of sodium periodate in a dispersion of water at 60 C for 48 h. 1...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the formulation of}} a ternary thermosetting adhesive which consists of a diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A (DGEBA) epoxy resin cured with 3, 3 ’-diamino <b>diphenyl</b> <b>sulphone</b> (3, 3 ’-DDS) hardener and modified through the addition of carboxyl- terminated butadiene-acrylonitrile (CTBN) rubber and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Processing implications of the novel adhesive in the film form are considered in order to manufacture bonded specimens for characterisation of the adhesive performance in structural joints. The ternary blend which represents the novel adhesive formulation is also characterised in bulk form. The cure kinetics behaviour of the novel ternary blend is investigated using differential scanning calorimetry which shows 10 % reduction in the total reactivity, and therefore reduced final crosslinking density, {{with the addition of}} the carbon nanotubes. A cure kinetics model is developed for the novel ternary thermoset. From characterisation of cast samples, a toughening effect of the phase separated rubber particles is observed, from 144 to 317 J/m 2, with a further increase to 551 J/m 2 {{in the presence of the}} carbon nanotubes. In the absence of rubber, the nanotubes alone produce a minimal effect upon the thermo-mechanical and mechanical characteristics of the resin. The morphology of the cured material is affected by the presence of the nanoparticles, resulting in the reduction of the mean rubber particle size from 3 µm to below 1 µm. The electrical conductivity of the cured resin samples is found to increase by six orders of magnitude, up to 3. 6 x 10 - 3 S/m in the ternary blend for a low carbon nanotube concentration of 0. 3 wt%. DCB and ELS tests are used to study the performance of the novel adhesive in a joint configuration. The adhesive joint strength is dependent on the substrate type as well as on the surface preparation. The novel adhesive is also examined under fatigue in a ‘bonded crack retarder’ application.

For PES bottles migration analysis of <b>diphenyl</b> <b>sulphone</b> (DPS), 4, 4 '-dichlorodiphenyl sulphone (DCPS) and 4, 4 '-dihydroxydiphenyl sulphone (DHPS; also known as bisphenol S), was done using the two different analytical methods with detection limits around 0. 1 - 0. 3 µg/kg, and therefore much below their respective legislative limits of migration of 50 - 3000 µg/kg, respectively (EU, 2002). In parallel, 40 bottles made of polycarbonate were analysed for the migration of BPA using a method validated at EU level and modified to a lower detection limit of 0. 1 µg/kg.

None of the 30 bottles made of PES released any detectable amounts of DCPS or DHPS and only 2 bottles released a very low amount of DPS of around 1 µg/kg in the milk food simulant compared to a limit of 3000 µg/kg.
