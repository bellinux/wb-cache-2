50|$|The musk <b>duck</b> <b>breeding</b> season {{varies with}} {{rainfall}} and water levels, but is typically between July and January, {{with the greatest}} number of clutches laid in September or October, the austral spring. Despite a number of more general studies, little is known about musk <b>duck</b> <b>breeding.</b> During breeding season, they give off the musky odour from which the species derives its common name. Also, in the season males advertise themselves loudly with a repetitive sequence of sounds: first, a ker-plonk splash made with the feet {{on the surface of the}} water; then two soft, sharp cuc cuc calls; then a loud whistle and a deep grunt. This sequence can be started at any time of day or night, with or without an associated visual display, and repeated every 4 or 5 seconds for as long as half an hour at a time. Although male musk ducks have a large leathery lobe below the bill and this swells during the breeding season, it is not connected to the vocal cavities and appears to be purely for visual purposes.|$|E

40|$|<b>Ducks</b> <b>breeding</b> in Fennoscandia {{represent}} {{a large part}} of the total population in Europe, and variations in reproductive success can affect continental population trajectories. It is therefore essential to understand processes affecting breeding success. In this thesis I have looked at temporal and spatial food abundance patterns and how these influence <b>breeding</b> <b>ducks.</b> Egg laying and hatching are often assumed to coincide with peaks in available food. No such peak in food abundance was evident in a boreal catchment based on six years of data. Even without clear food abundance peaks, changes in spring arrival can still lead to suboptimal breeding. I have investigated the importance of spring arrival and its effect on spring phenology and breeding success in two dabbling ducks (teal and mallard). Both species can change breeding time in response to variations in spring arrival; however, early springs have a negative effect on teal. Total food abundance is also important, and fish are known to reduce invertebrates, thus potentially affecting survival of ducklings. In a descriptive study I was able to illustrate that fish reduce the availability of invertebrate prey. Fish also reduce the number of <b>breeding</b> <b>ducks,</b> which is probably a result of competition although pike predation on ducklings can also be of importance. To investigate the effects of pike predation, I introduced adult pike to two lakes that were previously fishless. The number of pairs that settled was not affected by pike, but the subsequent breeding success was reduced significantly. The negative impact of pike on <b>breeding</b> <b>ducks</b> is likely to favour adaptations of anti-predator behaviour. In experimental trials, naïve ducklings recognised and responded to calls from predatory birds. They did not, however, avoid pike, although they displayed a very strong response to simulated pike attacks. They ran on the water, scattered and reassemble far from the initial attack. The lack of identification appears to be compensated by the ability to respond instantly to threat and thus reduce losses...|$|R

Here are hatched three-quarters of all the ducks raised in the United States. During a recent seven-year period the three-state area of Minnesota and the Dakotas produced an average of 4 to 5 million ducks annually (Janzon, 1947). This wetland region which once comprised 115, 000 square miles in five states had shrunk to about 56, 000 square miles by 19. 56 (Lynch, 1956).
