5|$|After {{holding out}} in Arnhem for four nights and three days, the 2nd Parachute Battalion {{surrendered}} overnight. At Oosterbeek there was around 3,000 {{men of the}} 1st Airborne Division dug in to form a perimeter. Everything including ammunition was now <b>in</b> <b>short</b> supply {{and most of the}} men had not eaten for over twenty-four hours.|$|E
5|$|Another {{long night}} at general {{quarters}} was anticipated by CTF 38. This intelligence was proved correct <b>in</b> <b>short</b> order. TGs38.1, 38.2, and 38.3 all suffered mass enemy air attacks between roughly 15:00–18:30 hours.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the middle}} of the film we show the Purim festival, a victory festival which the Jews {{celebrate}} as a festival of revenge on the Goyim, the Christians. Here I am depicting authentic Jewry as it was then and as it now continues unchecked in Poland. In contrast to this original Jewry, we are presented with Süss, the elegant financial adviser to the Court, the clever politician <b>in</b> <b>short,</b> the Jew in disguise.|$|E
5|$|As {{it moved}} into {{position}} around Bardia in December 1940, the 6th Division was still experiencing shortages. It {{had only two}} of its three artillery regiments, and only the 2/1st Field Regiment was equipped with the new 25-pounders, which it had received only that month. The 2/2nd Field Regiment was still equipped with twelve 18-pounders and twelve 4.5-inchhowitzers. Only A Squadron of the 2/6th Cavalry Regiment was on hand, {{as the rest of}} the regiment was deployed in the defence of the frontier posts at Al-Jaghbub and Siwa Oasis. The 2/1st Machine Gun Battalion had been diverted to Britain. Its place was taken by a British Army machine-gun battalion, the 1st Northumberland Fusiliers. The 2/1st Antitank Regiment had likewise been diverted, so each infantry brigade had formed an antitank company but 2-pounders were <b>in</b> <b>short</b> supply, and only eleven guns were available instead of the 27 required. The infantry battalions were particularly short of mortars, and ammunition for the Boys anti-tank rifle was <b>in</b> <b>short</b> supply.|$|E

5|$|Despite heavy weathering, {{the ditch}} is still visible <b>in</b> <b>short</b> sections, {{which can be}} 45yards wide and up to 5feet deep. A 330-yard stretch through Denton Golf Course, and a section running through Platt Fields Park, are {{considered}} the best preserved remains.

5|$|Following the Dunkirk {{evacuation}} in 1940, Britain faced {{a shortage}} of weapons. In particular, there was a severe scarcity of anti-tank weapons, many of {{which had to be}} left behind in France. One of the few resources not <b>in</b> <b>short</b> supply was petroleum oil since supplies intended for Europe were filling British storage facilities.|$|E
5|$|Hardcore punk was the {{response}} of American youths to the worldwide punk rock explosion of the late 1970s. Hardcore stripped punk rock and New Wave of its sometimes elitist and artsy tendencies, resulting <b>in</b> <b>short,</b> fast, and intense songs that spoke to disaffected youth. Hardcore exploded in the American metropolises of Los Angeles, Washington, DC, New York and Boston and most American cities had their own local scenes {{by the end of}} the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|His writing {{style is}} best {{described}} as equal parts anger, confidence, and pageantry. Scalia has a taste for garish analogies and offbeat allusions—often very funny ones—and he speaks in no uncertain terms. He is highly accessible and tries not to get bogged down in abstruse legal jargon. But most of all, Scalia's opinions read like they're about to catch fire for pure outrage. He does not, <b>in</b> <b>short,</b> write like a happy man.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>short,</b> Cobb {{does not}} {{conceive}} of dialogue as useful primarily to convert or be converted, {{but rather as}} useful in order to transform both parties mutually, allowing for a broadening of ideas and a reimagining of each faith in order that they might better face {{the challenges of the}} modern world.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>short,</b> the Wrights {{discovered}} the true {{purpose of the}} movable vertical rudder. Its role was not to change the direction of flight (as a rudder does in sailing), but rather, to aim or align the aircraft correctly during banking turns and when leveling off from turns and wind disturbances. The actual turn—the change in direction—was done with roll control using wing-warping. The principles remained the same when ailerons superseded wing-warping.|$|E

5|$|Most bovids {{alternately}} {{feed and}} ruminate throughout the day. While those that feed on concentrates feed and digest <b>in</b> <b>short</b> intervals, the roughage feeders take longer intervals. Only small {{species such as}} the duiker browse {{for a few hours}} during day or night. Feeding habits are related to body size; while small bovids forage in dense and closed habitat, larger species feed upon high-fiber vegetation in open grasslands.|$|E
5|$|On the ground, the Australian magpie {{moves around}} by walking, {{and is the}} only member of the Artamidae to do so; woodswallows, butcherbirds and currawongs all tend to hop with legs parallel. The magpie has a short femur (thigh bone), and long lower leg below the knee, suited to walking rather than running, {{although}} birds can run <b>in</b> <b>short</b> bursts when hunting prey.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the few}} {{resources}} not <b>in</b> <b>short</b> supply was petroleum oil; supplies intended for Europe were filling British storage facilities. Considerable effort and enthusiasm was put into making use of petroleum products as a weapon of war. The Army had not had flame-throwers since the First World War, but a significant number were improvised from pressure greasing equipment acquired from automotive repair garages. Although limited in range, they were reasonably effective.|$|E
