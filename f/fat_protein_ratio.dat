40|$|This thesis {{formed on}} the {{observation}} {{of the influence of}} body condition score (BCS) before calving on the prevalence of ketosis after calving and the structure of mixed ration on prevalence of rumen acidosis in production herd. This thesis was made on the farm AGROBOS Ltd. in Slatina where 165 cows are raised. 25 cows and 10 heifers were assessed in dry period and whole herd of dairy cows in the production hall was monitored for performance (PM). Body condition score of cows and heifers was assessed in the period before calving on a five point scale with resolution of 0. 25 points. Blood samples were taken from them {{from the base of the}} tail after calving. The concentration of betahydroxybutyrate (BHB) was monitored in blood at first to fourth days after calving using FreeStyle Optimum NEO. The structure of mixed ration in the production hall was evaluated using Penn State separator. The <b>fat</b> <b>protein</b> <b>ratio</b> from the PM system MOOML was observed and evaluated for incidence of chronic rumen acidosis. The measured values of BHB, the structure of the diet and the fat - protein ratio values were compared with the recommended values. As a criterium for a healthy state, the BHB concentration of 1. 4 mmol / l was selected. The rumen acidosis limit for the <b>fat</b> <b>protein</b> <b>ratio</b> was set at 1. 1. A lower fat protein ration was designated as ruminal acidosis. The suggested ration amounts for cows have been adjusted based on a grain mixture which was separately administered to dairy farms by the milking robot. Ketosis was detected in 83 % of cows on the second or higher lactation of which 9. 5 % had higher condition before calving, so 3. 75 point or higher. All evaluated heifers suffered ketosis after calving and 70 % had elevated condition before calving. The structure of the mixed ration had the highest deviations in proportions of large particles on upper sieve of separator. Up to 50 % of the particles for a mesh size of 19 mm were found. The average <b>fat</b> <b>protein</b> <b>ratio</b> was 1. 12 in the whole herd. Cows, which was measured for BHB and subsequently monitored in performance during first lactation, had in the first period the average proportion of fat - protein ratio of 1. 09, suggesting that the heifers on average suffered from ruminal acidosis in early lactation. Cows at second and higher lactation had in the first month of performance the average ratio of fat and protein of 1. 17. Measured values: BCS and BHB; F/P and structure of mixed ration were statistically evaluated using correlation. But we have not confirmed of dependence on one production illness...|$|E
40|$|Cystic ovarian disease (COD) is a {{considerable}} reason for economical losses in beef and dairy cows. Approximatly 30 % of all dairy cows develop COD at least once during their life time. COD {{is defined as a}} fluid filled structure on the ovary exceeding 25 mm in diameter with no palpable luteal structure present. It may be assumed that negative energy balance post partum causes pituitary insufficiency. Diagnosing COD by rectal palpation is reported to be unsafe. The objective of this investigation was to analyse the pevalence of COD and risk factors that are associated with cystic ovarian disease (COD) in dairy cattle. 132 Holstein Friesian cows of a commercial dairy farm were monitored from drying off, beginning of transition period, at calving and post partum every other week until ten weeks after calving. Blood samples were collected, centrifuged and stored at ý 20 oC until analysis. They were analysed for aspartate amino transferase (AST), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), Bilirubin, blood glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), glutamate dehydrogenase (GlDH), free fatty acids (FFA) and insulin. Net acid base excretion levels in urine (NABE), urine pH, body condition (BCS) and back fat thickness (BFT) were measured at the same time from eight weeks ante partum until ten weeks post partum. Urine samples were collected at the same time. NABE and urine pH were determined immediately. Every other week cows were examined clinically per rectum. After 50 d post partum the diagnosis of cysts was subsequently supported by ultrasound. After calving, twice weekly milk samples were collected and stored at ý 20 oC until analysis for progesterone. The samples of cows developing COD were analysed and compared to controls without COD. Prevalence of COD peaked six weeks post partum (18. 9 %). Six to ten weeks post partum, significantly higher levels of FFA and Bilirubin were observed in cows with follicle-theca-cysts. During the post partum period NSBA and pH level of urine of cows with follicle-theca-cysts were significantly lower than of cows without COD. Between drying off and transition we observed high increases of back-fat-thickness in cows with follicle-theca-cysts. We observed a significantly higher milkfat content and <b>fat</b> <b>protein</b> <b>ratio</b> in cows with follicle-theca-cysts on the first milktest day. The prevalence of COD increased with number of lactation. 	 Until 70 d post partum COD was found in 15. 4 % of examination by rectal palpation (n= 632). After analysing progesterone level 24 % of the cows showed ovarian dysfunction. From the observed 15. 4 % COD, 64 % did not show impaired cyclicity. In total there were more follicle-lutein-cysts than follicle-theca-cysts (61. 7 % vs. 38. 3 %). Scanned cows (n= 44) showed 63. 6 % follicle-theca-cysts and 43. 2 % follicle-lutein-cysts. After analysing progesterone, fewer cows (38. 6 %) were diagnosed of having follicle-theca-cysts and follicle-lutein-cysts (18. 2 %), respectively. Diagnosis of ovarian cysts, affecting adversely cows´ reproduction, made by single palpation per rectum or single ultrasonography are insufficient. Only analysis of progesterone profiles can clearly indicate ovarian dysfunction. The results of this investigation showed the enduring strain of the liver, caused by massive lipomobilisation (bilirubin, FFA) and latent acidotic (NABE, pH of urine) metabolism. Until 10 weeks pp the negative energy balance seems to have an effect on liver metabolism. Ketosis and fatty degeneration of liver increases the risk of follicle-theca-cysts especially 6 and 8 weeks post partum. The risk of cysts´ development can not be exactly predicted. The risk of COD can be reduced by assuring a smooth transition period limiting lipomobilisation and risk of acidosis. It remains to be investigated why cows under identical farm conditions and feeding respond differently to the stress of lactation. <br /...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry to measure milk ketone bodies to detect hyperketonemic cows and compare this method with milk <b>fat</b> to <b>protein</b> <b>ratio</b> to detect hyperketonemia. Plasma and milk samples were obtained weekly from calving to wk 9 postpartum from 69 high-producing dairy cows. The reference test for hyperketonemia was defined as plasma concentration of ß-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) = 1, 200 µmol/L. The weekly prevalence of hyperketonemia during the first 9 wk of lactation was, on average, 7. 1 %. Both BHBA and acetone in milk, determined by FTIR, had a higher sensitivity (80 %) to detect hyperketonemia compared with milk <b>fat</b> to <b>protein</b> <b>ratio</b> (66 %). Specificity was similar for the 3 diagnostic tests (71, 70, and 71 %). In conclusion, FTIR predictions of BHBA or acetone in milk can detect cows with hyperketonemia in early lactation with a higher accuracy compared with the use of milk <b>fat</b> to <b>protein</b> <b>ratio.</b> Because of the high proportion of false-positive tests, there are concerns about the practical applicability of FTIR predictions of acetone, BHBA, and <b>fat</b> to <b>protein</b> <b>ratio</b> in milk to detect hyperketonemic cows...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Milk urea {{concentration}} (MU) used by dairy pro-ducers {{for management}} purposes {{can be affected}} by selection for milk traits. To assess this problem, genetic parameters for MU in Polish Holstein-Friesian cattle were estimated {{for the first three}} lactations. The genetic correlation of MU with milk production traits, lactose percentage, <b>fat</b> to <b>protein</b> <b>ratio</b> (FPR) and somatic cell score (SCS) were computed with two 5 -trait random regression test-day models, separately for each lacta-tion. Data used for estimation (159, 044 daily observations) came from 50 randomly sampled herds. (Co) variance compo-nents were estimated with the Bayesian Gibbs sampling meth-od. The coefficient of variation forMU in all three parities was high (40 – 41 %). Average daily heritabilities of MU were 0. 22 for the first parity and 0. 21 for the second and third lactations. Average genetic correlations for different days in milk in the first three lactations between MU and other traits varied. They were small and negative for protein percentage (from − 0. 24 to − 0. 11) and for SCS (from − 0. 14 to − 0. 09). The weakest genetic correlation between MU and fat percentage, and be-tween MU and lactose percentage were observed (from − 0. 10 to 0. 10). Negative average genetic correlation with the <b>fat</b> to <b>protein</b> <b>ratio</b> was observed only in the first lactation (− 0. 14). Genetic correlations with yield traits were positive and ranged from low to moderate for protein (from 0. 09 to 0. 33), fat (from 0. 16 to 0. 35) and milk yield (from 0. 20 to 0. 42).

To find a possible association between postpartum diseases and FPR in dairy cattle, was the second {{objective of}} this study. 	Data collected from 1200 Holstein Frisian milking cows were used in this study. Daily milk <b>fat</b> to <b>protein</b> <b>ratios</b> were collected from each cow up to 21 days in milk (DIM) for the first objective. A FPR> 1. 5 measured in more than 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 days within 21 DIM were collected. Pregnancy loss and time to pregnancy within 300 DIM were collected. For the second objective, data was collected in the first 30 days after parturition for presence of the postpartum diseases metritis, ketosis, displaced abomasum (DA), indigestion and mastitis. 	In statistical analysis no significance was found for FPR in more than 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 days within 21 DIM. For this reason, one or more days was chosen for further analysis since the number of cows were most equally distributed between low and high FPR and pregnancy per AI to first service. Chi-square and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to find a possible association between the variables. 	No significant outcome between FPR> 1. 5 for one or more days during the first 21 DIM and pregnancy to first AI. An association was found for the postpartum diseases DA, metritis and ketosis with FPR> 1. 5. No significant association was found between mastitis and FPR> 1. 5, and indigestion and FPR> 1. 5.

40|$|Improvement {{of dairy}} cow {{fertility}} {{by means of}} genetic selection has become increasingly important over the last decades. Because fertility traits are difficult to measure and have low heritabilities, indicator traits are of interest to supplement the prediction of genetic merit for female fertility. This paper examines milk-based traits that could be potential predictor of fertility: changes in <b>protein</b> and <b>fat</b> composition, <b>fat</b> to <b>protein</b> <b>ratio,</b> urea, lactose, ketone bodies, and mid-infrared prediction of body energy traits. The pattern of genetic correlations between these traits and fertility over days in milk is likely related to the cow’s energy balance state.

Interval to first insemination (INT), 56 -day non-return rate after first insemination, number of inseminations (maximum of 3) {{and number of}} days open (DO) were used as measures of fertility. These measures {{were related to the}} production of milk, <b>fat,</b> <b>protein,</b> fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM), and to the <b>ratio</b> of <b>fat</b> to <b>protein</b> during the first 100 and 305 days of lactation. Breeding receipts from artificial insemination were matched with milk records. Cows were required to have at least one test-day record and one insemination record. A 2 -trait restricted maximum likelihood (REML) procedure for an unequal design was used, according to a model that included fixed effects of herd, year, season, age within parity and genetic group of cow and random effects of sire and error. Heritability estimates were between 0. 05 and 0. 09 for INT and 0. 01 and 0. 03 for DO. Small positive phenotypic correlations were found between yield traits and DO and INT.

The effect of subclinical ketosis on test day milk yields were studied separately for each parity using the mixed model analysis. The statistical model included the fixed effect of ketosis index, calving year-month, lactation stage and random effect of animals included in the study. The prevalence peak of subclinical ketosis occurred in the first month of lactation. Subclinical ketosis had a significant negative effect on daily milk yield.

The average cumulative milk production was 8, 200 kg. Conception (or not) within 5 intervals measured in days (20 to 60 d, 61 to 81 d, 82 to 102 d, 103 to 123 d, 124 to 144 d) was modeled {{as a function of}} milk yields and milk constituents at the start of lactation using multilevel discrete-time survival models. Milk yield, weight and percentage of <b>fat,</b> <b>protein,</b> and lactose, and somatic cell counts on the first 2 test-days of lactation were corrected for either stage of lactation alone or stage of lactation and time of year. Five hundred and 1, 628 herds, respectively, were used for parameter estimation and cross-validation. Covariates were retained in the final model if their coefficient was at least twice its standard error and their inclusion resulted in a decrease in the deviance. Overall, 73 % of cows recalved. The percentage of cows that had conceived by d 20, 61, 82, 103, 124, and 145 were 0. 5, 7. 3, 17. 9, 29. 3, 38. 7, and 46, respectively. The probability of conception before 145 d in milk increased with lower milk production on the second test-day, higher percentage of protein on the second test-day, and higher percentage of lactose on the first test-day. Positive associations were of a limited magnitude but nonetheless significant with the percentage of protein on the first test-day, the percentage of butterfat on the first test-day, and somatic cell count on both test-days.

Changes in covariances between BCS and milk production traits on a daily basis have not been investigated before and could be useful for determining which BCS estimated breeding values (EBV) might be practical for selection in the future. Field staff from Valacta milk recording agency (Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, QC, Canada) collected BCS from Quebec herds several times per cow throughout the lactation. Average daily heritabilities and genetic correlations among the various traits were similar to literature values. On an average daily basis, BCS was genetically unfavorably correlated with milk yield (i. e., increased milk yield was associated with lower body condition). The unfavorable genetic correlation between BCS and milk yield became stronger as lactation progressed, but was equivalent to zero for the first month of lactation. Favorable genetic correlations were found between BCS with Prot%, SCS, and Lact% (i. e., greater BCS was associated with greater Prot%, lower SCS, and greater Lact%). These correlations were strongest in early lactation. On an average daily basis, BCS was not genetically correlated with Fat% or MUN, but was negatively correlated with F:P. Furthermore, BCS at 5 and 50 d in milk (DIM) had the most favorable genetic correlations with milk production traits over the lactation (at 5, 50, 150, and 250 DIM). Thus, early lactation BCS EBV shows potential for selection. Regardless, this study showed that the level of association BCS has with milk production traits is not constant over the lactation. Simultaneous selection for both BCS and milk production traits should be considered, mainly due to the unfavorable genetic correlation between BCS with milk yield. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Spearman rank correlation coefficient, a non-parametric alternative to the Pearson correlation coefficient {{was used to determine}} the correlation between reproductive parameters of the herd and the milk data record. In the time interval of 60 to 90 days postpartum the highest correlation was found between FRP and CC (r= 0. 415, p< 0. 05). FPR was diagnostically evaluated using ROC (receiver operating characteristics) analysis which is based on completed 2 x 2 tables. A complete ROC analysis, including the area under the curve (AUC), provides an index of accuracy by demonstrating the limits of FPR's ability to discriminate between cows with different CC interval. The optimal cut-off value of FPR at 1. 34 provided the best discrimination power according to CC of 120 days. A cut-off value of FPR at 1. 1 was selected to enable over 90 % correct identification of cows with CC below 120 days. On the other hand, cows with FPR above 1. 44 were over 90 % correctly identified as cows with CC above 120 days. Kaplan-Meier survival curves show a significant difference in CC between cows with FPR lower and upper of 1. 34. CC lower than 120 days was observed in 80 %of cows with FPR lower than 1. 34 and only in 40 % of cows with FPR higher than 1. 34.

40|$|The {{goal for}} this applied {{research}} {{was to assess the}} production and composition of buffalo milk when Oil Palm kernel flour and Oil Palm kernel cake are supplemented to their diet. Thirty buffaloes from the grasslands of the Andes valleys in Colombia with 1 to 3 lactations and an average weight of 575 kg were selected for the experimental. The animals were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three experimental groups: (T 1 Control Group) with no diet supplements, (T 2) 1000 g·day- 1 of oil palm kernel cake and 350 g·day- 1 of molasses diet supplement, and (T 3) 1150 g·day- 1 of oil palm kernel flour. During the first 100 days of lactation, the milk livestock were individually weighed and milked. Milking was scheduled every 15 days, for a total of seven samples. The supplement consumption was recorded and a bromatological analysis of grasses was performed. The chemical composition of the milk was determined using an ultrasonic Ekomilk analyzer and a fatty acid full profile analysis was made using High Liquid Pressure Chromatography (HLPC). A 7 x 3 multiple variable statistical analysis was performed by sampling seven fifteen day periods and three types of diet. The average values of milk components observed were: 3. 54 % protein; 7. 4 % fat; total solids 16. 9 %; non-fat solids 9. 5 %; 2. 1 <b>fats</b> to <b>protein</b> <b>ratio.</b> The profile of fatty acids showed 2. 34 % of polyunsaturated; 33. 1 % of monounsaturated; 64. 6 % of unsaturated fatty acids; and 0. 96 % of Omega 6 acids.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{associations}} between nutrition and mortality {{at the national}} level. Altogether four aspects of this association are explored: (1) total calories with expectation of life, (2) dietary composition with expectation of life, (3) total calories with the age patterns of mortality, and (4) dietary composition with the age patterns of mortality. The data consist of life tables and national food balance sheets for 341 populations from 96 countries. A preliminary principal components analysis conducted on the dietary composition data yields three dietary components: (1) the overall {{quality and quantity of}} the diet, (2) the relative contribution of carbohydrates versus fats, and (3) the relative contribution of <b>fats</b> versus <b>proteins.</b> The results indicate that expectation of life at birth increases with total calories, with overall quality and quantity of the diet, and with the <b>ratio</b> of <b>fats</b> to <b>proteins.</b> The <b>ratio</b> of carbohydrates to fats is negatively associated with level of mortality. However, evidence indicates that the main effect of the <b>ratio</b> of <b>fats</b> to <b>proteins</b> is reversed when diets are high in quality and that all the effects tend to saturate at high nutrient availability. Variation in nutrition is also strongly associated with the international variation in age patterns of mortality. For example, when expectation of life is held constant, populations with higher quality diets tend to have lower childhood mortality and higher adult mortality. The results indicate that nutritional patterns are highly correlated with much of the world wide variation in mortality and may be a useful criterion for selecting or predicting the best suited model life table for use on a particular population...|$|R

Data for a total of 329 lactations, from 162 (65 HF, 48 J and 49 F 1) cows, were available. Milk yield was highest for HF, intermediate for F 1 and lowest for J, while milk <b>fat</b> and <b>protein</b> concentrations were highest for J, intermediate for F 1 and lowest for HF. Yield of <b>fat</b> plus <b>protein</b> was highest for F 1, intermediate for HF and lowest for J. Mean bodyweight was 523, 387 and 466 kg for HF, J and F 1, respectively. Body condition score was greater for the J and F 1 compared to HF. Reproductive efficiency was similar for the HF and J but superior for the F 1. The Moorepark Dairy Systems Model was used to simulate a 40 ha farm integrating biological data for each breed group. Milk output was highest for systems based on HF cows. Total sales of milk solids and, consequently, milk receipts were higher with J and F 1 compared to HF. Total costs were lowest with F 1 cows, intermediate with HF and highest with J. Overall farm profitability was highest with F 1 cows, intermediate with HF and lowest with J.

40|$|Milk {{recording}} {{consists in}} the regular, usually monthly, collection of a milk sample {{from all the}} lactating cows of a dairy herd. A large sample of milk recording data collected in England and Wales between 2004 and 2006 {{was used in this}} thesis. A sample of 8, 211, 988 recordings in 2, 128 herds, representing 16 % of the dairy herds in activity in December 2006, were described and analysed. Calvings followed a seasonal pattern with 80 % more calving in September than in May. Milk production was highest in May (26. 5 kg) and lowest in October (24. 1 kg). Butterfat was stable, close to 4 % from October to March and reached a minimum at 3. 7 % in June and July. Protein stayed between 3. 2 and 3. 3 % all the year. Geometric mean somatic cell count was between 177 and 180 between October and March and reached 205, 000 cells/mL in July and August. At the individual cow level, the mean milk yield, percentage of butterfat, percentage of <b>protein,</b> <b>fat</b> to <b>protein</b> <b>ratio</b> and somatic cell count (geometric mean) were 26. 4 kg, 3. 96 %, 3. 29 %, 1. 21 and 90, 000 cells/mL, between 5 and 305 days in milk. Changes in individual cow somatic cell counts around a threshold of 200, 000 cells/mL between consecutive recording dates were used to predict bulk milk somatic cell count at both the herd-year and test-day levels. The main contributors to bulk milk somatic cell counts were cows staying above the threshold for 2 consecutive test-days. Milk yields and composition at the start of lactation were used to predict the calving to conception interval. Higher milk yield, lower percentage of protein, lower percentage of lactose, higher somatic cell count and higher percentage of butterfat were associated with lower probabilities of conception before 145 days in milk.

40|$|Genetic {{selection}} {{allows for}} permanent improvement of dairy cow fertility and health. However, these traits are generally complex, difficult to record, and lowly heritable (< 0. 10). Hence, indicators {{have been proven}} as useful in the prediction of genetic merit for direct fertility and health traits {{as long as they}} are easier to measure, heritable, and genetically correlated. Considering that changes in (fine) milk composition over the lactation reflects the physiological status of the cow, the mid-infrared (MIR) analysis of milk opens the door to a whole new range of potential indicator traits of fertility and health. Previous studies investigated the phenotypic and genetic relationships between fertility and MIR-predicted phenotypes, most of them being related to negative postpartum energy balance and body fat mobilization (e. g., <b>fat</b> to <b>protein</b> <b>ratio,</b> urea, fatty acids profile). Results showed that a combination of various fatty acids traits (e. g., C 18 : 1 cis- 9 and C 10 : 0) could be used to improve fertility. Furthermore, occurrence of (sub-) clinical ketosis has been related to milk-based phenotypes such as fatty acids and ketone bodies. Hence, MIR-predicted acetone and β-hydroxybutyrate contents in milk were demonstrated as useful for breeding cows less susceptible to ketosis. Although studies investigating the genetic association among mastitis and MIR-predicted phenotypes are scarce, a wide range of traits, potentially predicted by MIR spectrometry, are worth considering. It includes traits related to the disease response of the cow (e. g., lactoferrin), to the reduced secretory activity (e. g., lactose) and to the alteration of blood-milk barrier (e. g., minerals, citrate). Moreover, direct MIR-prediction of fertility and health traits should be further considered. To conclude, MIR-predicted phenotypes have a role to play in the improvement of dairy cow fertility and health. However, further studies are warranted to (1) grasp underlying associations among MIR-predicted indicator and fitness traits, (2) estimate the genetic parameters, and (3) include these traits in broader breeding strategies.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to investigate the association of descriptors of herd environment with phenotypic levels and breeding values of fertility and health traits. Analyses were performed for 82, 080 first-lactation heifers and 173, 787 multiparous cows. Fourteen environmental parameters were defined that described herd environment, such as average protein production, average somatic cell score (SCS), average calving interval, and average body condition score (BCS). Herds with lower average SCS had, in general, more desirable values for almost all analyzed traits (i. e., days to first service was 7 d shorter), as did herds with lower average calving interval (i. e., 2. 8 % lower incidence of predicted mastitis). Herds with higher average protein production had slightly poorer fertility but more desirable values for all other analyzed traits (i. e., 5. 1 % less predicted mastitis, 0. 4 lower SCS, and 0. 6 higher BCS). Variance components and breeding values of sires were estimated by applying a random regression on the environmental parameters. In general, genetic variances varied generally only slightly across environments. However, based on data exclusively for heifers, the genetic variance for number of inseminations was 4. 1 times higher in herds with a higher number of inseminations, 1. 9 times higher for survival in herds with higher <b>fat</b> to <b>protein</b> <b>ratio,</b> and 1. 7 times higher for predicted mastitis in herds with higher number of inseminations. Based on the heifer data, the lowest estimated genetic correlation across environments was 0. 76 (SE 0. 21) for first-service conception between herds with differing average BCS. The minimum based on the cow data was 0. 65 (SE 0. 10) for survival between herds with differing average ages at calving. The relative importance of some fertility traits compared with yield traits doubled across environments. Possible reranking of individual animals within a population and the changes in genetic variance across environments suggests that environment-specific breeding values should be estimated for use in customized selection indice...|$|R
