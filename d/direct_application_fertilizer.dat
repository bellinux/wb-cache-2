"The {{sugarcane}} {{enters the}} sugar mill and is processed {{along one of}} two product chains: the sugar chain (containing the originally conceived sugar reﬁnery and the alcohol plant) or the paper chain (containing the pulp and paper mills). Each downstream (internal) company uses the by-products from upstream companies as secondary material inputs. In addition, careful attention is given to reducing the residual waste and to its ultimate disposal. The sugar chain results in the ultimate production of sugar, alcohol, cement, and compound fertilizer (i.e., fertilizer with a speciﬁc ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium). In the sugar reﬁnery, the sugarcane “juice” that is released in the crushing and grinding assembly in the sugar mill is reﬁned in a carbonation process that yields a higher quality reﬁned sugar than does the sulﬁtation process {{that is used by}} the majority of cane sugar plants in China (Wei 2004). Wei notes that sulﬁtation is favored by the GG’s competitors, in part, because the ﬁlter mud (one of the wastes from the reﬁning process) from sulﬁtation can easily be disposed of as a <b>direct</b> <b>application</b> <b>fertilizer.</b> Filter mud from the carbonation process, on the other hand, can have a signiﬁcant negative effect on the local soil if it is applied directly to the land. The GG has addressed this problem by using the carbonation ﬁlter mud as an input to the State-owned cement production facility it manages, rather than as a fertilizer. The GG contributes the ﬁlter mud and pays for transportation costs, balancing the savings from not having to pay for disposal. The fuel for the cement plant is coal, introducing an added environmental burden on the symbiosis. The residues from the alcohol plant (molasses)—which once would have been released into the environment—are now used as input to the production of compound fertilizer, which goes back to the sugarcane ﬁelds, thus closing this loop. The paper chain is driven by the input of bagasse, which is the residue from the sugar mill, minus the pith; that is, the soft interior portion of the cane. Sixty percent of the bagasse has ﬁbers long enough for paper-making. The short ﬁbers of the pith are used as fuel in a cogeneration power plant. Earlier, the GG burnt the bagasse in its power plant and sold it to homeowners for cooking and heating. The pulping operation that prepares the bagasse for conversion into paper requires a signiﬁcant addition of alkali, which ends up in the residue of that operation. The GG has constructed an alkali recovery plant that recycles the waste from the pulping operation (black liquor), generating a white sludge that can be used as input to the cement mill, which is primarily a part of the sugar chain. The pulp is processed by one of the three paper mills, where a major waste (white liquor) is generated and subsequently treated to recover major portions of ﬁber and water, which are recycled to the paper mills.” ...|$|E

40|$|The Chatham Rise {{phosphorite}} nodules {{have significant}} resource potential {{in terms of}} their distribution and concentration on the sea floor, and their end use as a phosphatic fertilizer. The most effective use of the nodules is as a <b>direct</b> <b>application</b> <b>fertilizer</b> which, at present, could assume a 10 % share of the New Zealand market, expanding to at least 25 % depending on its agronomic success. Technology for recovering the nodules has been only recently developed and commercial deep ocean mining is unprecedented worldwide. The mine site, in depths of about 400 metres and 600 kilometres from the mainland, presents many unknowns. Two options for mining are proposed and examined: 1) the lease of a mining ship for operation 4 - 5 months of a year, and 2) the purchase of a mining vessel for year-round operation. The first option appears to be cheaper overall at $ 45 - 70 /tonne phosphorite delivered to a New Zealand port. A pronounced economies of scale effect tends to halve operating costs if production rate is doubled. The net present value of the mining venture is subject to various constraints (the most significant of which is risk. There is risk associated with resource potential, mining technology, economics, and the legal and administrative framework governing operations. Risks are identified for each investor: Fletcher Challenge Ltd., West German interests, and New Zealand. It is determined that conflict exists among their various objectives for developing the phosphorite. Mining will cause stress to the marine environment. The nodules provide substrate for many benthic organisms which in turn are food for some demersal fish and other species. It is difficult to determine how the environment will recover from mining or if effects will be contained within the mine area. Long term impacts such as the cumulative effect of large amounts of fine sediment dispersed over much of the Chatham Rise, are also difficult to predict. This and the destruction of the habitat of ling may have adverse consequences for the Chatham Rise fishery. Risk is a significant consideration in novel, high technology developments such as the proposed Chatham Rise mining and as such, must be accounted for in policy. Policy must, therefore, be flexible and designed to cope with the unexpected.

40|$|Although the soybean was {{introduced}} into the United States in 1804, it is only recently that its production has increased {{to the point where}} as a cash-grain crop it ranks fourth in the United States and second in the Midwest. It is perhaps owing to the relatively new status of the soybean as an important crop that the soil fertility requirements are not as yet well understood. Notwithstanding the fact that soybean yields increase with the fertility level of the soil, experiments in the Midwest have shown in general that soybeans do not give the profitable response to <b>direct</b> <b>application</b> of <b>fertilizer</b> that is obtained with corn.

40|$|In {{less than}} 50 years Africa {{has changed from}} a food {{exporting}} region to being the largest importer of food worldwide. An increase {{in the use of}} fertilizers could help to rectify this situation but imported fertilizers are expensive to purchase and to transport to remote rural areas. The use of locally-available supplies, on the other hand, would transform the availability and cost of the much-needed plant nutrients. Throughout Africa crop production is constrained by low-fertility soils and even with adequate moisture soil nutrient levels are invariably insufficient for crops to express their full yield potential. Compost and manure can help maintain soil fertility but only by removing nutrients from elsewhere. Nitrogen-fixing plants can add nutrients to the soil, but even they contribute relatively small quantities of nitrogen and should be seen as a complement to fertilizer nitrogen rather than a substitute (see Spore No. 40 'Azolla for rice'). In addition to nitrogen, plants require a range of major and minor nutrients including phosphorus, potash, sulphur, calcium, magnesium, manganese and boron. A fertilizer demonstration programme organized by FAO over a decade ago showed that on traditional African farms nitrogen is almost always the nutrient which most limits crop yield; phosphorus is a close second. Potash deficiencies are more localized, but sulphur deficiency is now widely recognized as being as important as nitrogen and phosphorus in many areas. Several African countries have reserves of oil or natural gas which are sufficient to produce ammonia for nitrogen fertilizers, and some are using them for this purpose. Countries that have excess hydro-electric power can produce ammonia by the electrolytic hydrogen process. However, low rainfall has reduced water levels in major hydro-electric dams and they have had little surplus electricity after meeting the soaring industrial and domestic demand. Fertilizer resources in Africa According to the International Fertilizer Development Center - Africa, there are agromineral deposits throughout West Africa that may have potential as indigenous sources of plant nutrients. IFDC-Africa has launched a programme to start the long and arduous process of identifying these deposits and developing proposals for research projects to examine the agronomic and economic feasibility of using these materials (mainly phosphatic) as sources of nutrients for food production. IFDC-Africa will establish a database on West African deposits of phosphate, sulphur, lime, gypsum and dolomite. Phosphate deposits have been found in 36 African countries: the main producers are Algeria, Côte d'lvoire, Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Tunisia and Zimbabwe. Of the ACP countries, only Senegal and Zimbabwe produce sufficient phosphate for export. Several countries have indigenous ores which present processing problems, although some of those which prove unsuited to chemical processing might be suited to <b>direct</b> <b>application.</b> <b>Fertilizer</b> production Zambia is one country where locally-available phosphate rocks could, in theory, reduce the need for imported phosphatic fertilizers, the annual requirement for which is over 30, 000 t. A local company, Mining Exploration (MINEX), has carried out tests using acidulation on low grade areas to make Partially Acidulated Phosphate Rock (PAPR), which has been used successfully on maize and soya beans. MINEX has also shown that where residual brown soils, resulting from the weathering of carbonates, are washed the coating of iron oxide is removed and ores of 10 % grade can be enriched to 30 % phosphorus. This technique looks promising but the washing process requires large volumes of water: and water is in short supply in this region. There is virtually no production of potash in Africa although resources are reported to exist in more than ten countries. Solar evaporation of potash brines could provide a possible source in several countries. National options Faced with insufficient foreign exchange and transport difficulties almost all African ACP countries must develop whatever local resources are available for enhancing soil fertility. Preventing soil erosion and avoiding the burning of crop residues will reduce the loss of soil nutrients, and composting crop wastes and integrating nitrogen-fixing crops and trees into farming systems will go some way towards meeting crop requirements. Research is needed into simple, low-cost processing of low-grade rocks into utilizable fertilizers. Where deposits are too small for large-scale commercial exploration, they can still be useful regionally or locally. And where labour-intensive extraction and processing is the only alternative, this {{can be seen as a}} source of employment for rural people in slack seasons. In the final analysis government planning must recognize that the central position of food production in national economies demands that more resources be directed to all activities that can increase food production, including the utilization of all local resources for fertilizer production: oil and natural gas, hydro-electricity and native ore deposits.
