5|$|From the Sea of Marmara, {{the wall}} turns sharply to the northeast, {{until it reaches}} the Golden Gate, at about 14m above sea level. From there and until the <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Rhegion the wall follows {{a more or less}} {{straight}} line to the north, climbing the city's Seventh Hill. From there the wall turns sharply to the northeast, climbing up to the <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> St. Romanus, located near the peak of the Seventh Hill at some 68m above sea level. From there the wall descends into the valley of the river Lycus, where it reaches its lowest point at 35m above sea level. Climbing the slope of the Sixth Hill, the wall then rises up to the <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Charisius or <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Adrianople, at some 76m height. From the <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Adrianople to the Blachernae, the walls fall to a level of some 60 m. From there the later walls of Blachernae project sharply to the west, reaching the coastal plain at the Golden Horn near the so-called Prisons of Anemas.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eastern}} side of the land walls stands the second major {{entrance}} to the city, the <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Ploče. This gate is protected by the freestanding Revelin Fortress, which are connected by a wooden drawbridge and a twin-spanned stone bridge spanning a protective ditch. The Outer <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Ploče was designed and constructed by architect Mihajlo Hranjac in 1628, while the two bridges to the Revelin Fortress were built in the 15th century by Paskoje Miličević. Miličević was also designed the Pile Gate bridges, which explains the similarities between the bridges. Over the bridge, just like with the <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Pile, there is the statue of Saint Blaise, the patron saint of Dubrovnik.|$|E

United had the second-highest average {{attendance}} in English non-League football {{with an average}} <b>gate</b> <b>of</b> 3,059 and were the 87th best supported club across all divisions.

Their average league attendance then levelled out at approximately 2,000 per game, before rising to an average of 2,155 in 2014–15, the then-seventh highest attendance in non-League football. After moving to Broadhurst Park in May 2015, the club averaged a <b>gate</b> <b>of</b> 3,394 in 2015–16, a season-on-season increase of over 57% and the fourth highest attendance in non-League football.|$|E

5|$|Jaquio tells Ryu {{his master}} plan of using Ashtar as a pawn, used to awaken the true evil. He {{plans to use}} the Dark Sword of Chaos to use Irene's life force to open the <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Darkness and call up all the demons, while Ryu awakens them from their sleep. Jaquio then {{challenges}} Ryu to a showdown in which Ryu defeats him. Before Ryu and Irene can destroy the evil altar though, Jaquio's blood awakens the Dark Sword, which opens up the <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Darkness, shocks Irene and Ryu with its energy. The Demon Jashin arrives through the <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Darkness and reanimates the corpse of Jaquio. He then turns into a demonic wall, which Ryu, after borrowing strength from his Dragon Sword, defeats. Jashin is once again sealed away, the Dark Sword then breaks apart, the <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Darkness closes and disappears, and Ryu flees with Irene out of the temple just as it collapses. He then begins to mourn for Irene, who is presumed to be dead, when the power of the Dragon Sword revives her. Irene tells Ryu that she felt like she had been dreaming for a long time. Ryu tells her that the incident is over, and the game ends as the two watch the sun set.|$|E

5|$|The moat was {{situated}} {{at a distance}} of about 20m from the outer wall. The moat itself was over 20m wide and as much as 10m deep, featuring a 1.5m tall crenellated wall on the inner side, serving as a first line of defence. Transverse walls cross the moat, tapering towards the top {{so as not to be}} used as bridges. Some of them have been shown to contain pipes carrying water into the city from the hill country to the city's north and west. Their role has therefore been interpreted as that of aqueducts for filling the moat and as dams dividing it into compartments and allowing the water to be retained over the course of the walls. According to Alexander van Millingen, however, there is little direct evidence in the accounts of the city's sieges to suggest that the moat was ever actually flooded. In the sections north of the <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> St. Romanus, the steepness of the slopes of the Lycus valley made the construction maintenance of the moat problematic; it is probable therefore that the moat ended at the <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> St. Romanus, and did not resume until after the <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Adrianople.|$|E
5|$|The {{so-called}} Fourth Military Gate {{stands between}} towers 59 and 60, {{and is currently}} walled up. Recently, {{it has been suggested}} that this gate is actually the <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> St. Romanus, but the evidence is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|The wall {{contained}} nine main gates, which pierced {{both the}} inner and the outer walls, {{and a number of}} smaller posterns. The exact identification of several gates is debatable for a number of reasons. The Byzantine chroniclers provide more names than the number of the gates, the original Greek names fell mostly out of use during the Ottoman period, and literary and archaeological sources provide often contradictory information. Only three gates, the Golden Gate, the <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Rhegion and the <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Charisius, can be established directly from the literary evidence.|$|E

5|$|A later popular Polish legend {{related to}} the history of the Polish {{coronation}} weapon, the Szczerbiec sword, is the tale of the Golden <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Kiev, upon which the Szczerbiec was supposedly notched when Bolesław's entered the city. This legend has no historical basis, however, and the gate was only built approximately 20years later, while the sword itself was not forged until 200years later. It is of course possible, however unlikely, that Bolesław notched another gate with another sword, thus giving rise to the legend.|$|E
