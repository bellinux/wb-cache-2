5|$|Perhaps no {{work of art}} so {{imperfect}} ever announced {{such power}} in the artist—perhaps no artist so powerful ever rested his fame on so imperfect a production—as Thalaba. The author calls it a metrical romance; he might <b>have</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> a lyrical one; for the story is told, as in an ode, by implication; not directly, as in an epopoeia. It is a gallery of successive pictures. Each is strikingly descriptive... but the personages, like the figures of landscape-painters, are often almost lost in the scene: they appear as the episodical or accessory objects.|$|E
5|$|La Cousine Bette is {{considered}} Balzac's last great work. His trademark use of realist detail combines with a panorama of characters returning from earlier novels. Several critics have hailed it as {{a turning point}} in the author's career, and others <b>have</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> a prototypical naturalist text. It has been compared to William Shakespeare's Othello as well as Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace. The novel explores themes of vice and virtue, as well as the influence of money on French society. Bette's relationship with Valérie is also seen as an important exploration of homoerotic themes. A number of film versions of the story have been produced, including a 1971 BBC mini-series starring Margaret Tyzack and Helen Mirren, and a 1998 feature film with Jessica Lange in the title role.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of Sedna resurrected {{the question of}} which astronomical objects should be considered planets and which should not. On 15 March 2004, articles on Sedna in the popular press reported that a tenth planet had been discovered. This question was answered under the International Astronomical Union definition of a planet, adopted on 24 August 2006, which mandated that a planet must have cleared the neighborhood around its orbit. Sedna has a Stern–Levison parameter estimated to be much less than 1, and therefore cannot be considered to have cleared the neighborhood, even though no other objects have yet been discovered in its vicinity. To be a dwarf planet, Sedna must be in hydrostatic equilibrium. It is bright enough, and therefore large enough, that this {{is expected to be}} the case, and several astronomers <b>have</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> one.|$|E
25|$|In June 1941, German and Italian {{consulates}} were closed, {{and there}} were suggestions Japan's should be closed, as well. They were not, because they continued to provide valuable information (via MAGIC) and neither President Roosevelt nor Secretary Hull wanted trouble in the Pacific. Had they been closed, however, it is possible Naval General Staff, which had opposed the attack from the outset, would <b>have</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> off, since up-to-date information on {{the location of the}} Pacific Fleet, on which Yamamoto's plan depended, would no longer have been available.|$|E

International organizations have assessed that human rights violations in North Korea have no parallel in the contemporary world. The Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), led {{by a member of}} the ruling family, holds power in the state and leads the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of which all political officers are required to be members.|$|E

25|$|The House of Breath {{is a novel}} {{written by}} the American author William Goyen. It was his first book, {{published}} in 1950. It is not a novel in the usual sense in that it lacks traditional plot and character development. Upon its publication, reviewers noted the book for its unusual literary technique and style. Goyen called it a series of “arias”. Some critics <b>have</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> not a novel at all but a work to be read as poetry, over and over. The book touches on themes of family (kinship), human sexuality, place, time, and memory. It received critical acclaim upon its publication, not commercial success, but it did lead the way for support of the author’s further work through fellowships.|$|E
25|$|If, {{like other}} Platonists, he {{designated}} the material principle as undefined duality, the world-soul was probably described by {{him as the}} first defined duality, the conditioning or defining principle of every separate definitude {{in the sphere of}} the material and changeable, but not extending beyond it. He appears to <b>have</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> in the highest sense the individual soul, in a derivative sense a self-moving number, that is, the first number endowed with motion. To this world-soul Zeus, or the world-spirit, has entrusted - in what degree and in what extent, we do not learn - dominion over that which is liable to motion and change. The divine power of the world-soul is then again represented, in the different spheres of the universe, as infusing soul into the planets, Sun and Moon, - in a purer form, in the shape of Olympic gods. As a sublunary daemonical power (as Hera, Poseidon, Demeter), it dwells in the elements, and these daemonical natures, midway between gods and men, are related to them as the isosceles triangle is to the equilateral and the scalene. The divine world-soul which reigns over the whole domain of sublunary changes he appears to have designated as the last Zeus, the last divine activity.|$|E

"Mother Simpson" [...] {{is one of}} Oakley and Weinstein's {{favorite}} episodes; they <b>have</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> {{a perfect}} combination of real emotion, good jokes, and an interesting story. In 1996, [...] "Treehouse of Horror VI" [...] was submitted for the Emmy Award in the [...] "Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour)" [...] category because it had a 3D animation sequence, which they felt would have given it the edge. Pinky and the Brain eventually went on to win. Bill Oakley feels that had this episode been submitted, it would have easily won. The joke about Homer apparently being familiar with Walt Whitman is one of David Silverman's favorite jokes.|$|E

While Psy's original lyrics talk about the lifestyle of the Gangnam people, Latino's version is about a man that is enjoying his bachelor's party in a club, wanting (and having) sex with many women, so drunk that he says he does not know if he's really going to get married the next day. Latino had stated that it was an authorized version.|$|E

500|$|The Good Terrorist {{has been}} {{labelled}} a [...] "political novel" [...] by the publishers and some reviewers, including Alison Lurie in The New York Review of Books. Lurie stated that as political fiction, it is [...] "one {{of the best}} novels... about the terrorist mentality" [...] since Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent (1907), although this was questioned by William H. Pritchard in The Hudson Review, who wrote that compared to Conrad, The Good Terrorist is [...] "shapeless". Several commentators <b>have</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> more a novel about politics than political fiction. In From the Margins of Empire: Christina Stead, Doris Lessing, Nadine Gordimer, Louise Yelin called the work a novel about politics, rather than a political novel per se.|$|E
500|$|The battle {{occurred}} {{in the aftermath of}} the Battle of Wisconsin Heights, as Black Hawk's band fled the pursuing militia. The militia caught up with them on the eastern bank of the Mississippi River, a few miles downstream from the mouth of the Bad Axe River. The battle that followed was very one-sided: historians <b>have</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> a [...] since the 1850s. The fighting took place over two days, with the steamboat Warrior present on both days. By the second day, Black Hawk and most of the Native American leaders had fled, though many of the band stayed behind. The victory for the United States was decisive and the end of the war allowed much of Illinois and present-day Wisconsin to be opened for further settlement.|$|E
500|$|When it was built, {{many critics}} called the {{building}} too extreme, {{and lacking in}} style.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970, and named as part of the National Historic Landmark South Dearborn Street – Printing House Row North Historic District in 1976.
