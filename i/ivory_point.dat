60|$|First, {{although}} it was unnecessary as all the servants had gone to rest, I locked that door of my study which opened into the hall. The other door I {{did not think of}} locking, for beyond it was nothing but the private staircase which led to the wing of the house occupied by Jane and myself. Then I took off my coat and rolled up my shirt sleeve, fastening it with a safety-pin to the linen upon my shoulder. After this I lit a spirit-lamp and sterilised my lancet by heating it in the flame. Now, having provided myself with an <b>ivory</b> <b>point</b> and unsealed the tiny tube of lymph, I sat down in a chair so that the light from the electric lamp fell full upon my arm, and proceeded to scape the skin with the lancet until blood appeared in four or five separate places. Next I took the <b>ivory</b> <b>point,</b> and, after cleansing it, I charged it with the lymph and applied it to the abrasions, being careful to give each of them a liberal dose. The operation finished, I sat still awhile letting my arm hang {{over the back of the}} chair, in order that the blood might dry thoroughly before I drew down my shirt sleeve.|$|E
50|$|Clubs, stones, {{and sticks}} {{were the primary}} hunting tools during the Upper Paleolithic period, {{including}} the Gravettian period. Bone, antler, and <b>ivory</b> <b>points</b> have all been found at sites in France; but proper stone arrowheads and throwing spears did not appear until the Solutrean period (~20,000 Before Present). Due to the primitive tools, many animals were hunted at close range.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{existence}} of shaped bone and <b>ivory</b> <b>points,</b> {{to be used}} as awls or with wooden hafts, has been suggested for the Lower Paleolithic sites of Torralba and Ambrona and for several Middle Paleolithic sites, such as Vaufrey, Combe Grenal, Pech de l'Aze´ I and Camiac. The use of hafted bone and <b>ivory</b> <b>points</b> would imply a spear armature technology similar to that well documented in the Upper Paleolithic, often considered an innovation introduced to Europe by anatomically modern humans. The controversial <b>ivory</b> <b>points</b> from the two Spanish sites, whose fracture morphology is considered natural by G. Haynes (1991), have been reanalyzed, checking for putative traces of human manufacture and utilization as described by Howell & Freeman (1983), i. e., polish, flaking of stem, ground edges, striations from manufacture and contact with a haft or binding. We have been able to study 19 new proboscidean tusk tips from the ongoing Ambrona excavations by a Spanish team. For these and nine other Middle Paleolithic bone and antler points we use optical and SEM microscope analysis, taphonomic analysis, comparative observations of Upper Paleolithic bone points, experimental observations of manufacturing traces, modern tusk samples, and data on several bone and antler pseudo-points from carnivore accumulations. We show that none of the objects we have studied can be interpreted as an intentionally shaped point. The absence of hafted bone points in the Middle Paleolithic of Europe is contrasted with evidence of the use of hafted stone points since OIS 5 or earlier in Eurasia and Africa. We suggest that the absence of organic spear armatures in the Middle Paleolithic is not due to a deficiency in the technology of Neandertals but may be tied to the organizational strategies of the hunters and to patterns of game choice and capture...|$|R
50|$|Its mildly {{fragrant}} {{flowers are}} high centered, have 17 to 35 petals {{and an average}} diameter of 15 cm (6"). Their colour is weather dependent and can reach from lemon to <b>ivory.</b> The <b>pointed,</b> ovoid buds open to very large flowers with an elegant, opulent bloom form. They grow mostly solitary on long firm stems and appear quite late, but then almost continuously throughout the season.|$|R
25|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th Century {{vaccination}} {{was done}} either directly with vaccine produced on the skin of calves or, particularly in England, with vaccine obtained from the calf but then maintained by arm-to-arm transfer; initially in both cases vaccine could be dried on <b>ivory</b> <b>points</b> for short term storage or transport but increasing use was made of glass capillary tubes for this purpose towards {{the end of the}} century. During this period there were no adequate methods for assessing the safety of the vaccine and there were instances of contaminated vaccine transmitting infections such as erysipelas, tetanus, septicaemia and tuberculosis. In the case of arm-to-arm transfer there was also the risk of transmitting syphilis. Although this did occur occasionally, estimated as 750 cases in 100 million vaccinations, some critics of vaccination e.g. Charles Creighton believed that uncontaminated vaccine itself was a cause of syphilis. Smallpox vaccine was the only vaccine available during this period, and so the determined opposition to it initiated a number of vaccine controversies that spread to other vaccines and into the 21st century.|$|R

60|$|Now {{the figure}} of the glorious woman held a rod in either hand, and the rod in her right hand was white and of ivory, and the rod in her left hand was black and of ebony. And as those who came up before her throne greeted her, so she pointed now with the wand of ivory in her right hand, and now with the wand of ebony in her left hand. And with the wand of <b>ivory</b> she <b>pointed</b> to the gates of ivory, through which came light and laughter, and with the wand of ebony she pointed to the gates of coal, through which came {{blackness}} and groans. And as she pointed, so those who greeted her turned, and went, some through the gates of light and some through the gates of blackness.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the application of}} new dating strategies and protocols to the temporal position of Szeleta Cave, the Szeletian itself, and the Aurignacian of the Bükk mountains. In particular, it is advocated that the confusing chronological patterning seen for the Early Upper Palaeolithic of the Bükk mountains is largely the result of dating materials of uncertain anthropogenic origin and of incomplete removal of contaminants; hence we present here results of dating anthropogenically-modified bones, including bone, antler and <b>ivory</b> projectile <b>points,</b> using the ultrafiltration technique pioneered by the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit. The results have yielded a {{possible explanation for the}} confusing pattern of dates seen for Szeleta cave, and also helped to extend the earliest-known osseous projectile points back to 37 / 38 ka 14 C BP through the use of direct dating...|$|R
50|$|Artifacts at {{this zone}} are largely {{incomplete}} but include retouched flakes, scrapers, large a quartz chopper/scraper/plane. Also found at this zone are several ivory tusk fragments with scratches {{that could have}} come from stone tools. One tusk fragment has a stone microchip embedded in one of the scratches bolstering this theory. A cache was also found with <b>ivory</b> artifacts, two <b>points,</b> and a possible handle. One of the ivory fragments from this cache was radiocarbon dated to approximately 15,800 B.P. The age of the ivory suggests that it was scavenged by the occupants from a much older kill site as opposed to the inhabitants killing and processing the mammoth themselves.|$|R

Her {{function}} is as Diamond's horse, as she is able to shift into one. She hates Lady <b>Ivory</b> to the <b>point</b> of having somewhat murderous intentions, though she is always stopped by Diamond. Her hatred may be partially {{based on the fact that}} she cares for Diamond deeply, though he would never reciprocate her affection. She also seems to dislike Lazuli as she lets her escape when she was in Sable with Diamond and she doesn't prevent her from running off again at Emerald Castle.|$|R

50|$|It {{was then}} that the illithids first encounted the voor. The voor {{were one of the}} {{greatest}} threats the illithid empire ever faced. An insectoid race utterly immune to psionics, the voor reproduced using spores capable of floating through the airless reaches of outer space indefinitely before finding a place to transform into larvae, using whatever inorganic materials were on hand to create their bodies. The standard slave armies of the illithids were unable to stop the voor invasion, so in desperation a long-vanished illithid Creed constructed tumerogenesis tanks to impart certain physical, spiritual, and psionic enhancements on selected slave-soldiers. After thousands of years of slavery and controlled breeding, the illithid thralls were no longer recognizable as the humans they once were. They were longer of limb, with skin the tawny color of old <b>ivory</b> and slightly <b>pointed</b> ears.|$|R

5000|$|The Golden Lions {{eventually}} {{faced the}} NCAA National Champion Duke University basketball {{team in the}} first round of the tournament. Arkansas-Pine Bluff was the only Division I institution from the state of Arkansas to qualify for the NCAA tournament. For his teams outstanding accomplishments on the court Ivory was named the 2010 HSRN National Coach of the Year becoming the first coach from Arkansas-Pine Bluff to be awarded such honors. While head coach George Ivory is still attempting to bring major, young talent into the Golden Lions men's basketball roster, he is still having a standout career as one of the best coaches in UAPB history. Following in his footsteps, his oldest son Jacob <b>Ivory,</b> a standout <b>point</b> guard on the Murrah High School basketball team, made his commitment to Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) [...] He was announced a dandy dozen for the 2013-2014 season, meaning he was one of the top twelve players in the state of Mississippi. He averaged 14 points, 7 assists, 5 rebounds, and 4 steals per game last year. He was key to Murrah’s 2013 MHSAA 6A title win. Ivory made the 2013 Clarion-Ledger All-Metro and All-State lists for basketball. In the Mississippi North-South All-Star Basketball Game played this summer, Ivory led the North team in scoring with 16 points.|$|R
