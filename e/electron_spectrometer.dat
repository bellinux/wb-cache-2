We show that a 90 degrees deflection angle can be realized by a combination of two novel deflectors with 90 degrees and 180 degrees deflection angles each.

50|$|Segregation {{to grain}} boundaries, for example, {{can lead to}} grain {{boundary}} fracture {{as a result of}} temper brittleness, creep embrittlement, stress relief cracking of weldments, hydrogen embrittlement, environmentally assisted fatigue, grain boundary corrosion, and some kinds of intergranular stress corrosion cracking. A very interesting and important field of study of impurity segregation processes involves AES of grain boundaries of materials. This technique includes tensile fracturing of special specimens directly inside the UHV chamber of the Auger <b>Electron</b> <b>Spectrometer</b> that was developed by Ilyin.Segregation to grain boundaries can also affect their respective migration rates, and so affects sinterability, as well as the grain boundary diffusivity (although sometimes these effects can be used advantageously).|$|E
50|$|As the {{electron}} beam {{passes through the}} sample, some electrons in the beam lose energy via inelastic scattering interactions with electrons in the sample. In electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), the energy lost by {{the electron}}s in the beam is measured using an <b>electron</b> <b>spectrometer,</b> allowing features such as plasmons, and elemental ionization edges to be identified. Energy resolution in EELS is sufficient to allow the fine structure of ionization edges to be observed, which means that EELS {{can be used for}} chemical mapping, as well as elemental mapping. In STEM, EELS can be used to spectroscopically map a sample at atomic resolution. Recently developed monochromators can achieve an energy resolution of ~10 meV in EELS, allowing vibrational spectra to be acquired in STEM.|$|E
50|$|The plasma experiment's {{goal was}} to study the ionized gases (plasma) of the solar wind, the {{temperature}} and density of its electrons, and how the planets affected the velocity of the plasma stream. The experiment contained two components, facing in opposite directions. The Scanning Electrostatic Analyzer was aimed toward the Sun, and could detect positive ions and electrons, which were separated {{by a set of}} three concentric hemispherical plates. The Scanning <b>Electron</b> <b>Spectrometer</b> was aimed away from the Sun, and detected only electrons, using just one hemispherical plate. The instruments could be rotated about 60 degrees to either side. By gathering data on the solar wind's movement around Mercury, the plasma experiment could be used to verify the magnetometer's observations of Mercury's magnetic field. Using the plasma detectors, Mariner 10 gathered the first in situ solar wind data from inside Venus' orbit.|$|E

50|$|In {{electron}} energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) a material {{is exposed to}} a beam of electrons with a known, narrow range of kinetic energies. Some of the electrons will undergo inelastic scattering, {{which means that they}} lose energy and have their paths slightly and randomly deflected. The amount of energy loss can be measured via an <b>electron</b> <b>spectrometer</b> and interpreted in terms of what caused the energy loss. Inelastic interactions include phonon excitations, inter- and intra-band transitions, plasmon excitations, inner shell ionizations, and Cherenkov radiation. The inner-shell ionizations are particularly useful for detecting the elemental components of a material. For example, one might find that a larger-than-expected number of electrons comes through the material with 285 eV less energy than they had when they entered the material. This is approximately the amount of energy needed to remove an inner-shell electron from a carbon atom, which can be taken as evidence that there is a significant amount of carbon present in the sample. With some care, and looking at a wide range of energy losses, one can determine the types of atoms, and the numbers of atoms of each type, being struck by the beam. The scattering angle (that is, the amount that the electron's path is deflected) can also be measured, giving information about the dispersion relation of whatever material excitation caused the inelastic scattering.|$|E
50|$|Table-top {{laser-based}} angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy {{had been}} developed by some research groups. Daniel Dessau of University of Colorado, Boulder, made the first demonstration and applied this technique to explore superconducting system. The achievement not only greatly reduces the costs and size of facility, but also, most importantly, provides the unprecedented higher bulk sensitivity due to the low photon energy, typically 6 eV, and consequently the longer photoelectron mean free path (2-7 nm) in the sample. This advantage is extremely beneficial and powerful {{for the study of}} strongly correlated materials and high-Tc superconductors in which the physics of photoelectrons from the topmost layers might be different from the bulk. In addition to about one-order-of-magnitude improvement in the bulk sensitivity, the advance in the momentum resolution is also very significant: the photoelectrons will be more broadly dispersed in emission angle when the energy of incident photon decreases. In other words, for a given angular resolution of the <b>electron</b> <b>spectrometer,</b> the lower photon energy leads to higher momentum resolution. The typical momentum resolution of a 6 eV laser-based ARPES is approximately 8 times better than that of a 50 eV synchrotron radiation ARPES. Besides, the better momentum resolution due to low photon energy also results in less k-space accessible to ARPES which is helpful to the more precise spectrum analysis. For instance, in the 50 eV synchrotron ARPES, electrons from the first 4 Brillouin zones will be excited and scattered to contribute to the background of photoelectron analysis. However, the small momentum of 6 eV ARPES will only access some part of the first Brillouin zone and therefore only those electrons from small region of k-space can be ejected and detected as the background. The reduced inelastic scattering background is desirable while doing the measurement of weak physical quantities, in particular the high-Tc superconductors.|$|E
5000|$|In typical {{laboratory}} use, {{a sample}} {{is placed in}} the specimen chamber of a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Because the SEM uses a beam of electrons to illuminate the sample and produce the three dimensional images often seen in lay news reports and publications as well as professional journals, the sample must be able to conduct electricity. If the sample is metallic, electron conduction is already present because of the natural electrical conductivity of metal. It is non-metallic, the sample is usually coated with a layer of gold and platinum approximately twenty nanometers deep. This is sufficient for the sample to be conductive without being so thick as to [...] "hide" [...] elements present within the sample. When the electrons emitted by the SEM collide with electrons in the atoms of the sample, the physics of typical electron-electron collisions apply, such that sample electrons having less energy in their orbital shells than the energy setting of the SEM (kev setting), will be displaced from their orbits by the higher energy SEM electrons. This leaves the atom in an unstable state, which is remediated by higher energy electrons in the sample [...] "dropping" [...] down to occupy the electron shells previously ejected by the higher energy SEM electrons. In order to accomplish this, the higher energy electrons within the atom must relinquish the excess energy that exists between the ejected electrons and the higher energy electrons. One way of doing this is by the creation of photons of xray energy. This energy can be detected by the <b>electron</b> <b>spectrometer</b> with a detector placed within the specimen chamber of the SEM, and the electrons can be identified as to the elements from which they were emitted. This gives a qualitative picture of which elements are present within the sample, because the energy dispersive spectrometer can scan the entire group of elements present up to the kev setting of the SEM, which is user controlled by simply switching a knob or pressing a button to set the upper limit of the kev power of the SEM's electron beam. It should be noted that by coating non-conductive samples with gold and platinum as described above, significant peaks will appear on the graph at the kev points of gold and platinum. These peaks can usually be easily removed from the graph by the software of the spectroscopy system should they overshadow areas where naturally occurring elements are present. If these elements include gold or platinum, the problem can be sidestepped in the beginning by using carbon as the coating agent. Carbon is electrically conductive but sufficiently [...] "light" [...] such that the typical energy dispersive spectrometer {{will not be able to}} detect it within its usual range of detection, which often goes down to sodium but has difficulty detecting lighter elements without the use of a separate wavelength detector.|$|E
