This approach aims at {{the integration of the}} company level (micro-level) and the industry level (macro-level) into the penetration mechanism.

A <b>Gompertz</b> <b>curve</b> was modelled on the yield data and showed good predictive properties. QTL analyses were done on the raw measurements and on the individual parameters of the <b>Gompertz</b> <b>curve</b> and its predicted growth for each interval. Half-sib and variance component linkage analysis revealed QTL with different modes of inheritance but with low resolution. This was complemented by association studies using single markers or haplotypes, and additive, dominance, parent-of-origin and epistatic QTL effects. All association analyses were done on phenotypes pre-corrected for pedigree effects. These methods detected QTL positions with high concordance {{to each other and}} with greater refinement of the linkage signals. Two-locus interaction analysis detected no epistatic pairs of QTL. Overall, using stringent thresholds we identified QTL regions using linkage analyses, corroborated by 6 individual SNPs with significant effects as well as two putatively imprinted SNPs. Conclusions We obtained consistent results across a combination of intra- and inter- family based methods using flexible linear models to evaluate a variety of models. The <b>Gompertz</b> <b>curve</b> fitted the data really well, and provided complementary information on the detected QTL.

However, at least from a practical point of view, the plausibility of their testing framework regarding the market potential m is not unquestionable. The results {{presented in this article}} suggest that the utility-based approach could achieve more accurate forecasts when applying a more reasonable range for m, rather than varying it between 2 and 15 times the cumulative sales by the end of year 7 as proposed by NN (2011).

40|$|While {{generally}} {{justifying the}} large amount of money invested in the treatment effort, evaluation studies of treatment centers for drug addiction do not offer a rational method of allocating scarce resources among the various available treatment programs. The problem is further confounded by different costs associated with the different programs and also because clients rarely complete the prescribed treatment. We developed functional relationships between treatment outcomes and time in treatment that allow the inclusion of probable length of stay of patients and cost per week for a particular treatment program in the evaluation considerations. The model evolved from a drug addiction treatment system operating in Newark, New Jersey consisting of six different treatment centres. Treatment outcome measures are derived from a psychosocial questionnaire which was administered to patients at appropriate time intervals. The questionnaire probed into the important facets of human behavior as related to the use or non-use of drugs for non-medical reasons. <b>Gompertz</b> <b>curves</b> reflecting treatment benefit are computed for each treatment center by least square fit of the collected data to appropriate differential equations and used together with cost of treatment retention rates to compute expected net benefit for each treatment center.

Methods: We collected 4, 320 mammograms (age range, 24 - 83 years) from 970 women in the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study and the Australian Breast Cancer Family Registry. Women had on average 4. 5 mammograms (range, 1 - 14). DA, PDA, and NDA were measured using the Cumulus software and normalized using the Box-Cox method. Correlations in the normalized risk-predicting measures over time intervals of different lengths were estimated using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling of <b>Gompertz</b> <b>curves.</b> Results: Mean normalized DA and PDA were constant with age to the early 40 s, decreased over the next two decades, and were almost constant fromthemid- 60 sonward. Mean normalizedNDA increased nonlinearly with age.

To derive a gross-domestic product (GDP) -dependent Gompertz function, Chinese GDP is estimated using a recursive dynamic Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. The Gompertz function is estimated using historical data on vehicle development trends in North America, Pacific Rim and Europe to overcome the problem of insufficient long-running data on Chinese vehicle ownership. Results indicate that the number of projected vehicle stocks for 2050 is 300, 455 and 463 million for low-, medium-, and high-growth scenarios respectively. Furthermore, the growth in China’s vehicle stock will increase beyond the inflection point of <b>Gompertz</b> <b>curve</b> by 2020, but will not reach saturation point during the period 2014 – 2050.

However, both equations have noteworthy shortcomings when fitting some empirical features of economic growth: the logistic equation is characterized by strong symmetries, whilst the growth rate is decreasing in the case of both equations. In this paper, we have set out to overcome these limitations by defining a family of unimodal differential equations which includes the logistic and Gompertz equations and covers practically the whole spectrum of sigmoid curves. We have identified three sub-families of these differential equations, all offering good mathematical expressions. Using these, it is possible to obtain an acceptable fit for any S-shaped curve.

The Hanwoo cows (n = 3, 373) were born in 97 Hanwoo commercial farms in the 17 cities or counties of Gyeongbuk province, Korea, between 2000 and 2007. A total of 5, 504 ultrasound measurements were collected for the cows at the age of 13 to 165 months in 2007 and 2008. Wither height (HW), rump height (HR), the horizontal distance between the top of the hips (WH), and girth of chest (GC) were also measured. Analysis of variance was conducted to investigate variables affecting LMA and BFT. The effect of farm nested in location was included in the statistical model, as well as the effects of HW, HR, WH, and GC as covariates. All of the effects were significant in the analysis of variance for LMA and BFT (p< 0. 01), except for the HR effect for LMA.

Despite that the true model used to simulate the data was the logistic growth model, the Gompertz model provided a good fit of the data. Genomic breeding values calculated from predicted phenotypes were highly correlated with the breeding values obtained by directly using the respective observed phenotypes. The accuracies between the true and estimated breeding value at time 600 were above 0. 93, even though t 600 was outside the time range used when fitting the data.

(1981). The CWSI was used to develop exponential yield-CWSI relationships for a range of water-deficit-stressed and well-watered alfalfa during a growth cycle. The exponential curves became more curvilinear with time. The CWSI allowed the 1983 and 1984 yield data to be combined for the yield-CWSI curves;A response surface of yield, the CWSI, and time was developed by combining the exponential yield-CWSI curves with double expo- nential <b>Gompertz</b> <b>curves</b> of yield regressed on time. The response surface equation had an R-squared of 0. 65 (n = 395);Analysis of windspeed effects on canopy minus air temperature and the CWSI indicated that highly water-deficit-stressed alfalfa showed stronger responses to increased windspeed than well-watered alfalfa. The CWSI was better kept within its theoretical boundaries of 0 and 1 by the incorporation of windspeed into its upper and lower limits. When row cover is incomplete, as it was for this experiment, the lower limit may be more adequately character- ized by the addition of more meteorological variables;Growth analyses of leaf area, total dry weight, and leaf dry weight showed that highly water-deficit-stressed alfalfa had more leaf dry weight and leaf area per unit total dry weight than well-watered alfalfa, but low leaf area to leaf dry weight ratios, meaning that water-deficit-stressed alfalfa had thicker leaves than well-watered alfalfa;Well-watered alfalfa had more total dry weight, leaf area, and leaf dry weight than water-deficit-stressed alfalfa; Reference;Idso, S.
