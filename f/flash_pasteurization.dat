5|$|After the E.coli outbreak, Odwalla {{improved}} {{the safety of}} several of its production processes. Before the fruit enters the factory, it is washed, sorted and sanitized. Once it has reached the plant, the apples, carrots, and citrus fruits are separated and washed again. The fruit is pressed to get the juice, which is then flash pasteurized and bottled. A sample undergoes quality testing, and, if it passes, the batch is shipped in refrigerated trucks to various distribution centers in the United States. Odwalla juice has a relatively short shelf life compared to other beverages and thus must be refrigerated. However, after the introduction of <b>flash</b> <b>pasteurization</b> in 1996 and a new plastic bottle in 2001, the shelf life has been considerably extended. Generally, Odwalla products are sold in special Odwalla-brand displays at grocery and convenience stores, instead of being intermixed with other products.|$|E

40|$|In the {{developing}} world, {{many women are}} unable to breastfeed their children due to disease, malnourishment or lack of time to invest in breastfeeding. In an attempt to address the medical issues this causes, human breast milk banks have been established {{in some of these}} communities and healthy mothers have been encouraged to donate their breast milk for infants who would not otherwise have access to breast milk. Since many of these banks are located in resource limited areas, they often lack proper refrigeration and pasteurization equipment. Improper refrigeration and incomplete pasteurization of donated breast milk often results in the donated breast milk being infected with Escherichia coli (E. coli). Recently, non- governmental organizations such as PATH, a leader in global health innovation, have stepped in to develop simple methods for <b>flash</b> heat <b>pasteurization</b> {{that can be used in}} resource limited areas without current equipment. However, there is no existing way to ensure that breast milk has been pasteurized properly by <b>flash</b> heat <b>pasteurization.</b> Thus, there is an immediate need for a sensor that can detect pathogenic E. coli bacteria in the breast milk after this pasteurization. The objective of our project is to design an economical paper-based microfluidic sensor that tests for levels of E. coli in donated breast milk. The goal is to ensure that all distributed breast milk pasteurized by the <b>flash</b> heat <b>pasteurization</b> process is safe for infants to consume before it is distributed...|$|R

50|$|<b>Flash</b> <b>pasteurization</b> is {{performed}} to kill spoilage microorganisms prior to filling containers, {{in order to}} make the products safer and to extend their shelf life compared to the unpasteurised foodstuff. For example, one manufacturer gives the shelf life of its pasteurized milk as 12 months. It must be used in conjunction with sterile fill technology (similar to aseptic processing) to prevent post-pasteurization contamination.|$|E

In the early years of canned orange juice, the acidity of the juice caused the juice to have a metallic taste. In 1931, Dr. Philip Phillips developed a <b>flash</b> <b>pasteurization</b> process that eliminated this problem and significantly increased the market for canned orange juice.|$|E

50|$|The {{next step}} {{is one of the}} most vital in the {{processing}} of orange juice. Pasteurization is important in destroying naturally occurring enzymes that are associated with deterioration of the juice. Pectinesterase is infamous for its deteriorative activity in orange juice. In the pasteurization process, juice is generally rapidly heated to 197 °F for about 40 seconds. Several industry leaders use <b>flash</b> <b>pasteurization,</b> which is carried out by tubular or plate-type heat exchangers. In order to prevent over heating, turbulent flow is vital to heat the juice rapidly. Cans are filled with the pasteurized juice and inverted immediately to allow the juice to sterilize the inside parts of the lid. The orange juice filled can is sealed and cooled to 90 to 100 °F by spinning on the conveyor belt under cool water sprays. Quality of storage is determined by time and temperature. Juice must be stored at cool temperatures to prevent deterioration.|$|E
50|$|A handle, {{located on}} the first floor, {{controls}} a trap door {{on the bottom of}} the hopper, which allows the fruit to fall thru to the first floor chute. On their way down the chute, the apples are chopped into small pieces, about four bushels at a time, and are then placed in a special nylon blanket. This process continues until up to 12 blankets are stacked on top of one another.The layers of chopped apples are on a large turntable that rotates under the apple press. The press used at Yates Cider Mill is called a ‘screw press’ because large screws turn to make the press go down, putting 50 tons of pressure on the blankets of chopped apples for 15 minutes. As the press goes down on the blankets, the cider comes thru the weave in the cloth leaving the seeds, peelings and pulp inside the blanket. All by-products are then discarded down a chute in the floor and into a small railroad car under the mill. Periodically, the car is transferred to the dump area. The cider then flows from the press to chilled mixing tanks. From there, the cider is filtered to remove any and all small apple particles. <b>Flash</b> <b>pasteurization</b> is the last step before bottling. The cider is heated to 160 degrees Fahrenheit for six seconds and then immediately cooled back down to 35 degrees and bottled. In one autumn weekend, the mill juices over half a million apples and can produce 300 gallons of cider an hour.|$|E

40|$|Mother’s own milk (MOM) is {{the first}} choice in preterm infant feeding, {{and when it is}} not {{available}} or is insufficient, donor human milk (DHM) is recommended. It has been shown that feeding preterm infants with human milk is less related to major morbidities, enhances feeding tolerance and prevents metabolic syndrome in childhood. As The Committee on Nutrition of the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) states, specific guidelines for Human Milk Banks (HMB) are needed to guarantee the best possible compromise between microbiological safety and nutritional/biological quality of human milk (HM). Currently, Holder pasteurization (HoP: pasteurization process at 62. 5 - 63 °C for 30 minutes) is recommended by all international guidelines: this method inactivates bacterial and viral pathogens but it also affects some nutritional and biological properties of human milk. New methods to ameliorate the biological quality and safety of DHM are under investigation in the last years. High Pressure Processing (HPP) is a non- thermal process used in food industries: this technology inactivates pathogenic microorganisms by applying hydrostatic high pressure, however further researches are required before applying this technology in milk banking. Ultraviolet-C irradiation (UV-C) is another non-thermal method capable of reducing vegetative bacteria in human milk and it also seems to preserve higher levels of immunological proteins than HoP. High-temperature short-time pasteurization (HTST: <b>flash</b> <b>pasteurization,</b> 72 °C for 5 - 15 seconds) currently is available only at industrial level, but it could represent an alternative to HoP seeming to maintain the protein profile and some of the key active components of DHM.

40|$|In {{the last}} ten years can be {{recorded}} a multiple number of minibreweries, called sometimes craft breweries I tis not caused only by demand of kinds of beer characterised by special types of beer styles, but as well by the fact, that they are not anyway regulated and keep their natural taste and smell. The problém of unregulated (unfiltered and unpasteurized) beers starts by the contamination during their production and it may cause their relatively fast spoiling. Shelf life of these beers is e few weeks only. The time of their minimal shelf life is influenced by a lot of factors content of alcohol, rest extract and mentioned extent of contamination. The breweries called as industrial or commercional treat their beers by pasteurization or filtration which cause inactivation or killing of the microorganisms or their elimination. These beers are microbiologically stabile, they are not liable to quick spiling and i tis possible to insure their longer shelf life. Pasteurized a filterd beers show changes in their sensorial character. The aim of this diploma thesis was to determinate the condition of <b>flash</b> <b>pasteurization</b> of unfiltered beers with the aim of microbiological stability and simultaneously no changes of their sensorial quality. The experiment is finally in treatment unfiltered beer by differnt dosing of pasteurization units and following microbiological analysis, able to demonstrate the stability effect. The analysis were used with unfiltered and unpasteurized beers and with unfiltered beers where the pasteurization doses 20 PU, 30 PU, 40 PU, 60 PU, 80 PU and 100 PU were used. The idividual parameters were watched within the horizont of 4 months. The part of these tests was even microbiological analysis of the rinse water. Another task was to find out the dates from the microbiological controls of beer in selected small breweries, which use in order to heighten of microbiological stability, different kinds of filtration, to verify their effectivity and to appreciate their acceptability for minibreweries. The test showed the effectiveness of pasteurization of unfiltered beer with the rations 40 PU minimally. Where higher ratins were used could be seen apparent sensorial changes. The pasteurization of unfiltered beers are for craft breweries useful only in case of higher production of bottled beer or beer for export, because the financial expenses bound with provision flash pasteurizer are to big and for minibreweries mostly limiting. The kieselguhr filtration as well the ultrafiltration are for minibreweries unusefull, as they could not be able to insure such conditions that provide their proper affectiveness...|$|E
