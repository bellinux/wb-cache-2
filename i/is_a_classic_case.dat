500|$|The {{origin of}} the English word [...] (Old English catt) and its {{counterparts}} in other Germanic languages (such as German Katze), descended from Proto-Germanic *kattōn-, is controversial. It has traditionally {{thought to be a}} borrowing from Late Latin cattus [...] "domestic cat", from catta (used around 75 AD by Martial), compare also Byzantine Greek , Portuguese and Spanish gato, French chat, Maltese qattus, Lithuanian katė, and Old Church Slavonic kotъ (kotka), among others. The Late Latin word is generally thought to originate from an Afro-Asiatic language, but every proposed source word has presented problems. Many references refer to [...] "Berber" [...] (Kabyle) kaddîska [...] "wildcat" [...] and [...] "Nubian kadīs" [...] as possible sources or cognates, but M. Lionel Bender says the Nubian term is a loan from Arabic قِطَّة qiṭṭa. Jean-Paul Savignac suggests the Latin word is from an Egyptian precursor of Coptic [...] (šau) [...] "tomcat" [...] or its feminine form suffixed with , but John Huehnergard says [...] "the source [...] was clearly not Egyptian itself, where no analogous form is attested." [...] Huehnergard opines it is [...] "equally likely that the forms might derive from an ancient Germanic word, imported into Latin and thence to Greek and to Syriac and Arabic". Guus Kroonen also considers the word to be native to Germanic (due to morphological alternations) and Northern Europe, and suggests that it might ultimately be borrowed from Uralic, cf. Northern Sami gađfe [...] "female stoat" [...] and Hungarian hölgy [...] "stoat; lady, bride" [...] from Proto-Uralic *käďwä [...] "female (of a fur animal)".

Roberts) and bureaucracy existed alongside feudalism, while in Europe, bureaucracy emerged as a counter system to feudal order.Therefore, according to some historians the term feudalism, is not supposed to be an exact fit to the Western Zhou political structure but it can be considered a system analogous to the one that existed in medieval Europe.

His Pigs for the Ancestors: Ritual in the Ecology of a New Guinea People was published in 1968 and again in 1984 It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>classic</b> <b>case</b> study of human ecology in a tribal society and the roles of culture and ritual. The research comes from his fieldwork and time spent with the Maring tribe of Papua New Guinea, who lacked hereditary chiefs or officials. Instead of treating whole cultures as separate units, he focused [...] "on populations in the ecological sense, that is, {{as one of the}} components of a system of trophic exchanges taking place within a bounded area." [...] (Biersack,1999,5). Rappaport explained his reasoning behind using populations as opposed to cultures, [...] "Cultures and ecosystems are not directly commensurable. An ecosystem is a system of matter and energy transactions among unlike populations or organisms and between them and the non-living substances by which they are surrounded. 'Culture' is the label for the category of phenomena distinguished from others by its contingency upon symbols." [...] (Biersack,1999, 6). Throughout his work, he studied how an ecosystem maintains itself through a regulatory force. He aimed to show the adaptive value of different cultural forms in maintaining the pre-existing relationship with their environment. In this case, it was ritual acting as the regulator, when pigs were sacrificed during times of warfare. This was done by the tribal members to acquit themselves of debts to the supernatural. Herds of pigs were maintained and fattened until the required work load pushed the limits of the tribes carrying capacity, in which case the slaughter began.|$|E
