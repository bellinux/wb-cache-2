40|$|This paper {{identifies}} {{three types}} of export subsidies: taxpayer, consumer only, and producer financed. A consumer only <b>financed</b> <b>export</b> subsidy involves price discrimination and revenue pooling. We show that consumer only <b>financed</b> <b>export</b> subsidies are more trade distorting than taxpayer <b>financed</b> <b>export</b> subsidies. Domestic price discrimination alone is a consumer tax. We describe {{the conditions under which}} price discrimination for a non-traded product like fluid milk but not for a traded product also constitutes an export subsidy. Price discrimination in world markets combined with revenue pooling in the domestic market is a production subsidy (like New Zealand Dairy Board practices). We show that producer <b>financed</b> <b>export</b> subsidies can only exist if a consumer only or a taxpayer <b>financed</b> <b>export</b> subsidy is in place first. Trade distortion with a producer tax on a taxpayer <b>financed</b> <b>export</b> subsidy differs from that of a tax on a consumer only <b>financed</b> <b>export</b> subsidy. The WTO Panel ruling on Canadian dairy pricing for three milk classes is shown to be inconsistent with the economic definition of export subsidies. We conclude that export subsidies are inadequately dealt with in the Agreement o...|$|R
