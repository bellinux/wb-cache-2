25|$|Development of {{the engine}} and <b>engine</b> <b>accessories</b> was the {{responsibility}} of Bristol Siddeley, while BAC {{was responsible for the}} variable intake and overall engine installation, and Snecma the exhaust nozzle/thrust reverser/noise attenuation and the afterburner. Britain was to have a larger share in production of the Olympus 593 as France had a larger share in fuselage production. Ground test running {{of the engine}}s was co-ordinated between Bristol Siddeley, Patchway, the National Gas Turbine Establishment (NGTE), Pystock, UK, and the Centre d'Essais des Propulseurs (CEPr) at Saclay, France.|$|E
25|$|The {{basic design}} of the Typhoon was a {{combination}} of traditional Hawker construction (such as used in the earlier Hawker Hurricane) and more modern construction techniques; the front fuselage structure, from the engine mountings {{to the rear of the}} cockpit, was made up of bolted and welded duralumin or steel tubes covered with skin panels, while the rear fuselage was a flush-riveted, semi-monocoque structure. The forward fuselage and cockpit skinning was made up of large, removable duralumin panels, allowing easy external access to the engine and <b>engine</b> <b>accessories</b> and most of the important hydraulic and electrical equipment.|$|E

Automatic belt {{tensioner}} for stabilization of <b>Engine</b> <b>accessory</b> belt system is made increase its life, decrease {{noise and vibration}} and increase its commercial value. Therefore, it is important finding test mode to assess life of automatic {{belt tensioner}}. However, measurement and analysis test result in practical test condition on real road needs requiring much test time and finance. In this study, there is analyzed and established test mode which is loaded measured equivalent damage in real working condition, compared test condition of pre-established test mode and FTP- 75 mode of fuel efficiency test and verified {{advantages and disadvantages of}} each mode. Because FTP- 75 Mode is for measuring fuel efficiency related with engine, applying FTP- 75 mode is estimated suitability for test of <b>engine</b> <b>accessory.</b> Comparison and assessment of damage is investigated structure and pulley part. Equivalent damage is calculated with Palmgren-Miner Rule and representative stress method, test condition of automatic belt tensioner is investigated. This investigation is regarded as being useful to life evaluation of both automatic belt tensioner and other <b>engine</b> <b>accessory</b> component...|$|R
50|$|As the Air Force {{moved through}} its {{first decade of}} independence, its aircraft, <b>engines,</b> <b>accessories,</b> and support {{equipment}} became increasingly sophisticated and complex, requiring use of new technologies and innovative programs {{to meet the challenges}} of the future.|$|R
25|$|Engines on the 737 Classic series (-300, -400, -500) and Next-Generation series (-600, -700, -800, -900) do {{not have}} {{circular}} inlets like most aircraft. The 737 Classic series featured CFM56 turbofan engines, which yielded significant gains in fuel economy {{and a reduction in}} noise over the JT8D engines used on the −100 and −200, but also posed an engineering challenge given the low ground clearance of the 737. Boeing and engine supplier CFMI solved the problem by placing the engine ahead of (rather than below) the wing, and by moving <b>engine</b> <b>accessories</b> to the sides (rather than the bottom) of the engine pod, giving the 737 a distinctive non-circular air intake.|$|E
25|$|During development, Camm and the Hawker {{design team}} had placed a high {{priority}} on making the Tempest easily accessible to both air and ground crews; to this end, the forward fuselage and cockpit areas of the earlier Hurricane and the Tempest and Typhoon families were covered by large removable panels providing access to as many components as possible, including flight controls and <b>engine</b> <b>accessories.</b> Both upper wing roots incorporated panels of non-slip coating. For the pilot a retractable foot stirrup under the starboard root trailing edge was linked {{to a pair of}} handholds which were covered by spring-loaded flaps. Through a system of linkages, when the canopy was open the stirrup was lowered and the flaps opened, providing easy access to the cockpit; as the canopy was closed, the stirrup was raised into the fuselage and the flaps snapped shut.|$|E
500|$|The first prototype, {{with the}} {{internal}} designation of T, made its first flight on 11 June 1941. Its initial flight tests, conducted by the manufacturer between 1 July and 5 October, were a disappointment as it could reach only a speed of [...] at , [...] slower than estimated. The three-bladed [...] AV-5L-114 propellers were exchanged for four-bladed [...] AV-9B-L-149 propellers and the engine installation was redesigned, after wind tunnel tests by TsAGI (Central Aero and Hydrodynamics Institute), which revealed that the poorly designed <b>engine</b> <b>accessories</b> were the major cause of the excess drag. After modifications, the aircraft reached [...] {{at an altitude of}} [...] Its time to [...] was 5.5 minutes. Even with the improvements the LII (Lyotno-Issledovatel'skiy Institoot—Flight Research Institute) did not recommend production, but recommended that development and testing should continue. The German advance on Moscow in October 1941 forced the Institute and the DIS to evacuate to Kazan while the OKO and its factory went to Kuibyshev. The failure of the AM-37 to enter production doomed the project, albeit temporarily.|$|E
50|$|Underdrive pulleys {{increase}} {{engine output}} {{by reducing the}} draw of the <b>engine's</b> <b>accessories</b> by slowing them down and reducing the HP they use. Horsepower gains from underdrive pulleys can vary by vehicle, <b>engine,</b> number of <b>accessories</b> {{and the amount of}} underdrive (Improvements of up to 5-15 HP at the wheels have been seen). Additional and significant performance improvements can be seen by reducing the weight of the pulley versus the original pulley. Gains can range from 3-6 HP per pound of weight reduced.|$|R
50|$|Although bulky, {{the engine}} was wide only at the top. The width across the {{crankshaft}} was relatively narrow as the CBX had a stacked <b>engine</b> <b>accessory</b> arrangement, whereby the alternator and ignition items were positioned behind the cylinder block. This arrangement produced an acceptable engine width low down and moved critical items out of harm's way {{in the event of}} grounding.|$|R

2500|$|The 567 is {{laid out}} with <b>engine</b> <b>accessories</b> (oil and water pumps and governors) at the [...] "forward" [...] end and the power take off at the [...] "rear" [...] end. The blowers and {{camshafts}} are at the [...] "rear" [...] end of the engine, with the blowers mounted above the power take off."The full line of engines was designed with the same general arrangement, revising basically only the length of crankshaft and crankcase to [...] the required number of cylinders. It appeared that the most satisfactory method of having the <b>engine</b> <b>accessories</b> such as pumps, governor, etc. easily maintained would be to drive them through a gear train at the forward end of the engine, that is, opposite the power take-off end. Having {{the location of the}} pumps all {{at one end of the}} engine, called the accessory drive end, fitted very well into locomotive installation. A leaf spring flexible drive gear mounted on the crankshaft was used to eliminate all crankshaft torsional vibration from the gear train."By using either one or two blowers for an 8 or 12 cylinder engine respectively and mounting them above the main generator, it was possible to shorten the overall length of the engine and generator installation. This was one of the main original objectives. The blowers as well as the camshafts were driven at the power take-off end of the engine by another gear train." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although the Griffon was {{designed}} for naval aircraft, on 8 November 1939 N E Rowe of the Air Ministry suggested fitting the Griffon in a Spitfire. Three weeks later permission was given to Supermarine to explore the possibilities of adapting the Griffon to the Spitfire; in response Supermarine issued 'Specification 466' on 4 December. This decision led {{to a change in}} the disposition of the <b>engine</b> <b>accessories</b> to reduce the frontal area of the engine as much as possible. As a result the frontal area of the bare Griffon engine was [...] compared with [...] of the Merlin, despite the Griffon's much larger capacity. This redesigned engine first ran on 26 June 1940 and went into production as the Griffon II.|$|E
50|$|There {{were a few}} {{reasons why}} the replica was built. First of all, the company wanted to have the Präsident for the jubilee celebrations, and {{secondly}} the original underwent modifications of <b>engine,</b> <b>accessory,</b> lights, the convertible top {{as well as of}} the colour livery, and thus it couldn't represent the factory's very first car. The work on replica started in March 1974 and were scheduled to be finished on 1 May 1977.|$|R
25|$|Later testing {{involved}} {{the use of}} an exhaust turbine which was a half-scale version of that used in the Whittle W.1 turbojet, the first British jet engine to fly. Unlike a conventional turbocharger the turbine was coupled to the <b>engine's</b> <b>accessory</b> driveshaft and acted as a power recovery device. It was thought that using the turbine would lower fuel consumption allowing the engine to be used in larger transport aircraft. This was confirmed during testing, but failures due to severe overheating and drive shaft fractures were experienced.|$|R

2500|$|Boeing {{engineer}} Mark Gregoire led {{a design}} team, which cooperated with CFM International to select, modify and deploy a new engine and nacelle {{that would make}} the 737-300 into a viable aircraft. They chose the CFM56-3B-1 high-bypass turbofan engine to power the aircraft, which yielded significant gains in fuel economy and a reduction in noise, but also posed an engineering challenge, given the low ground clearance of the 737 and the larger diameter of the engine over the original Pratt & Whitney engines. Gregoire's team and CFM solved the problem by reducing the size of the fan (which made the engine slightly less efficient than it had been forecast to be), placing the engine ahead of the wing, and by moving <b>engine</b> <b>accessories</b> to the sides of the engine pod, giving the engine a distinctive non-circular [...] "hamster pouch" [...] air intake. Earlier customers for the CFM56 included the U.S. Air Force with its program to re-engine KC-135 tankers.|$|E
2500|$|The J402-CA-400 was a {{single-shaft}} engine, {{with one}} axial compressor stage and one centrifugal compressor stage. The compressed air was combusted in an annular combustor, and then {{passed through a}} single high-pressure turbine stage before being exhausted. Because the engine was designed for a one-time use missile, its service life was only one hour. The primary challenge of the [...] "wooden round" [...] requirement was to design the engine to be as reliable as possible. To that end, significant {{efforts were made to}} reduce the number of individual parts throughout the engine. For example, the rotor system of the J402 had 16 parts, while the J69 (the parent engine) had 149 parts for the same system. Another simplifying measure was to eliminate the standard gearbox. All the <b>engine</b> <b>accessories,</b> like the fuel pump and electrical alternator, ran directly off the rotor shaft. Engine starting was another reliability-critical function of the engine, and to accomplish that requirement, the J402 utilizes pyrotechnic cartridges to start the engine. Finally, the engine was among the first to feature a fully electronic analog fuel controller.|$|E
2500|$|Tractors {{and heavy}} {{equipment}} were often multifuel in the 1920s through 1940s, running spark-ignition and low-compression engines. Thus many farm tractors {{of the era}} could burn gasoline, alcohol, kerosene, and any light grade of fuel oil such as diesel fuel, heating oil, or tractor vaporising oil, according to whichever was most affordable in any region at any given time. On U.S. farms during this era, the name [...] "distillate" [...] often referred {{to any of the}} aforementioned light fuel oils. The engines did not start as well on distillate, so typically a small auxiliary gasoline tank was used for cold starting, and the fuel valves were adjusted several minutes later, after warm-up, to switch to distillate. <b>Engine</b> <b>accessories</b> such as vaporizers and radiator shrouds were also used, both with the aim of capturing heat, because when such an engine was run on distillate, it ran better when both it and the air it inhaled were warmer rather than at ambient temperature. Dieselization with dedicated diesel engines (high-compression with mechanical fuel injection and compression ignition) replaced such systems and made more efficient use of the diesel fuel being burned.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s Boeing {{selected}} the CFM56-3 to exclusively power the Boeing 737-300 variant. The 737 wings were {{closer to the}} ground than previous applications for the CFM56, necessitating several modifications to the engine. The fan diameter was reduced, which reduced the bypass ratio, and the <b>engine</b> <b>accessory</b> gearbox was moved {{from the bottom of}} the engine (the 6o'clock position) to the 9o'clock position, giving the engine nacelle its distinctive flat-bottomed shape. The overall thrust was also reduced, from , mostly due to the reduction in bypass ratio.|$|R
50|$|Electric {{systems have}} an {{advantage}} in fuel efficiency {{because there is no}} belt-driven hydraulic pump constantly running, whether assistance is required or not, and this is a major reason for their introduction. Another major advantage is the elimination of a belt-driven <b>engine</b> <b>accessory,</b> and several high-pressure hydraulic hoses between the hydraulic pump, mounted on the engine, and the steering gear, mounted on the chassis. This greatly simplifies manufacturing and maintenance. By incorporating electronic stability control electric power steering systems can instantly vary torque assist levels to aid the driver in corrective maneuvers.|$|R

2500|$|The 400 was {{replaced}} for 1970 with the [...] Buick V8, {{used in the}} GS 455. The base model V8 was rated 350hp (260kW) and [...] at 2800 rpm. In the optional Stage1 trim it was rated** 360hp (268kW) and 510lb·ft (691Nm) at a low 2800 rpm. As with all American engines produced prior to the 1972 model year, these were SAE gross ratings, which are generally significantly higher than SAE net ratings and are not indicative of what actual production engines produce in their [...] "as installed" [...] condition (with all <b>engine</b> <b>accessories</b> and full exhaust system in place). [...] The fastest magazine test results from this period were obtained by MOTOR TREND Magazine, which managed to extract a 13.38 ET @ 105.5 MPH from their 3,810 pound GS Stage 1 coupe test car. Using Hale's Trap Speed formula, this result indicated actual [...] "as installed" [...] peak HP of approximately 360 SAE Net (ironically the same as its advertised Gross Figure, meaning this engine was very conservatively rated for that time period). [...] The use of the larger sized 455 block created a maintenance problem by the exhaust manifolds being in too {{close proximity to the}} upper and lower A-arm bushings.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the rotation vibration {{dynamics of the}} pulleys and the tension arms, and to estimate the vibrations of the belts and the slip ratio between the belt and the pulleys in the <b>engine</b> front-end <b>accessory</b> drive systems, a systematic modelling and analytical method is proposed for <b>engine</b> front-end <b>accessory</b> drive systems; this {{can be used for}} modelling <b>engine</b> front-end <b>accessory</b> drive systems with different layouts and different numbers of tensioners, including automatic and fixed tensioners. In the modelling, the rotational pulleys are classified as fixed-axis pulleys and moveable-axis pulleys (such as the pulley in the tensioner). Moreover, the belt spans are classified as the belt spans between the two fixed pulleys, and the belt spans adjacent to the pulley of a tensioner. The equations of motion for each type of pulley and the tension calculation equations for each type of belt span are developed. In this way, the equations of motion for all the pulleys and the tensioner arms can be obtained easily, irrespective of the layout of the tensioners. To obtain the dynamic rotational vibration responses of an <b>engine</b> front-end <b>accessory</b> drive system by the conventional Runge-Kutta method, high-efficiency algorithms or methods are also proposed for calculating the tangent-point coordinates between a belt and the adjacent pulleys and the belt length of the contact arc on one pulley.
