40|$|International audienceEarthquakes are feared {{because they}} often strike so suddenly. Yet, there are innumerable reports of pre-earthquake signals. Widespread {{disagreement}} exists in the geoscience community how these signals can be generated in the Earth's crust and whether they are early warning signs, related to the build-up of tectonic stresses before major seismic events. Progress in understanding and eventually using these signals has been slow because the underlying physical process or processes are basically not understood. This has changed with the discovery that, when igneous or high-grade metamorphic rocks are subjected to deviatoric stress, dormant electronic charge carriers are activated: electrons and <b>defect</b> <b>electrons.</b> The activation increases the number density of mobile charge carriers in the rocks and, hence, their electric conductivity. The <b>defect</b> <b>electrons</b> {{are associated with the}} oxygen anion sublattice and are known as positive holes or pholes for short. The boundary between stressed and unstressed rock acts a potential barrier that lets pholes pass but blocks electrons. Therefore, like electrons and ions in an electrochemical battery, the stress-activated electrons and pholes in the "rock battery" have to flow out in different directions. When the circuit is closed, the battery currents can flow. The discovery of such stress-activated currents in crustal rocks has far-reaching implications for understanding pre-earthquake signals...|$|E

40|$|The {{basis of}} many non-seismic pre-earthquake signals, in {{particular}} low frequency electromagnetic (EM) emissions, are transient electric currents that {{flow in the}} Earth’s crust.

By monitoring the time evolution of the photoinduced excited state which {{is associated with the}} photocatalyzed dissociation of ethanol on Ti- 5 c sites of TiO 2 (110), the fractal-like kinetics of this surface photocatalytic reaction has been obtained. The measured photocatalytic dissociation rate on reduced TiO 2 (110) is faster than that on the oxidized surface. This is attributed to the larger defect density on the reduced surface which lowers the reaction barrier of the photocatalytic reaction at least methodologically.

An improved version of the extended-ion method {{which is based on}} the one electron Hartree-Fock approximation is used to perform these calculations. Its main feature is the exclusive use of floating 1 s Gaussian functions as basis. For the multi-electron defect systems, the calculation of matrix elements of two electron interaction terms is a most difficult problem.

If burst-like, these currents should lead to the emission of low frequency electromagnetic radiation. Understanding how electronic charge carriers are stress-activated in rocks, how they spread or flow probably holds the key to deciphering a wide range of pre-earthquake signals.

40|$|Prior {{to major}} {{earthquakes}} many {{changes in the}} environment have been documented. Though often subtle and fleeting, these changes are noticeable at the land surface, in water, in the air, and in the ionosphere. Key to understanding these diverse pre-earthquake phenomena has been the discovery that, when tectonic stresses build up in the Earth’s crust, highly mobile electronic charge carriers are activated. These charge carriers are <b>defect</b> <b>electrons</b> on the oxygen anion sublattice of silicate minerals, known as positive holes, chemically equivalent to O− in a matrix of O 2 −. They are remarkable inasmuch as they can flow out of the stressed rock volume and spread into the surrounding unstressed rocks. Travelling fast and far the positive holes cause a range of follow-on reactions when they arrive at the Earth’s surface, where they cause air ionization, injecting massive amounts of primarily positive air ions into the lower atmosphere. When they arrive at the rock-water interface, they act as •O radicals, oxidizing water to hydrogen peroxide. Other reactions at the rock-water interface include the oxidation or partial oxidation of dissolved organic compounds, leading to changes of their fluorescence spectra. Some compounds thus formed may be irritants or toxins to certain species of animals.

40|$|Abstract—Seismic {{waves are}} the most {{dramatic}} and most intensely studied manifestations of earthquakes. However, we also know of non-seismic phenomena, which precede large earthquakes. Some {{of them have been}} reported for centuries, even millennia. The list is long and diverse: bulging of the Earth’s surface, changing well water levels, ground-hugging fog, low frequency electromagnetic emission, earthquake lights from ridges and mountain tops, magnetic field anomalies up to 0. 5 % of the Earth’s dipole field, temperature anomalies by several degrees over wide areas as seen in satellite images, changes in the plasma density of the ionosphere, and strange animal behavior. Because it seems nearly impossible to imagine that such diverse phenomena could have a common physical cause, there is great confusion and even greater controversy. This explains why reports on non-seismic pre-earthquakephenomena are regarded with suspicion in the scientific community. This may change with the recent discovery that igneous and metamorphic rocks, which make up a major portion of the Earth’s crust, contain electric charge carriers, which have been overlooked in the past. These charge carriers are <b>defect</b> <b>electrons</b> in the valence band, i. e., positive holes. Under normal conditions they are dormant, but when they ‘‘wake up’’, the rocks begin to sparkle and glow. This paper describes the physical and chemical nature of these positive holes, how they are introduced into minerals and rocks, and how they become activated. Evidence will be presented that, once the positive holes are generated, currents propagate through the rocks leading to electromagnetic emission, to positive surface potentials, to corona discharges, to positive ion emission, and to mid-infrared radiation. These phenomena are expressions of the same fundamental process: the ‘‘awakening’ ’ of dormant positive hole charge carriers that turn rocks momentarily into p-type semiconductors...|$|E
40|$|Though {{ubiquitous}} in minerals of igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks, peroxy defects {{have been widely}} overlooked in the past. The charge carriers of interest are positive holes, chemically equivalent to O^- in a matrix of O^ 2 -, physically <b>defect</b> <b>electrons</b> in the O^ 2 - sublattice, highly mobile, able to propagate fast and far. O^- are oxidized relative to O^ 2 -. As such O^- {{are not supposed to}} exist in minerals and rocks that come from deep within the Earth crust or upper mantle, where the environments are overwhelmingly reduced. In order to understand how peroxy defects are introduced, we look at peroxy defects in a crystallographically and compositionally well characterized model system: single crystals of nominally high-purity MgO, grown from the melt under highly reducing conditions. During crystallization the MgO crystals incorporate OH^- through dissolution of traces of H_ 2 O into the MgO matrix, leading to a solid solution (ss) Mg_ 1 -δ(OH) _ 2 δO_ 1 - 2 δ, where δ < 1. During cooling, ss turns into a metastable supersaturated solid solution (sss). During further cooling, OH^- pairs at Mg^ 2 + vacancy sites rearrange their electrons, undergoing a redox conversion, which leads to peroxy anions, O_ 2 ^ 2 -, plus molecular H_ 2. Being diffusively mobile, the H_ 2 can leave their Mg^ 2 + vacancy sites, leaving behind cation-deficient Mg_ 1 -δO. During reheating O_ 2 ^ 2 - break up, releasing positive hole charge carriers, which affect the electrical conductivity behavior. In rocks, similar changes in the electrical conductivity are observed in the temperature window, where peroxy defects of the type O_ 3 Si-OO-SiO_ 3 break up. They release positive holes, which control the electrical conductivity response along the geotherm. Comment: 30 pages, 8 figure...|$|E

Thus, understanding and control of defects, including dopants in low-dimensional systems, hold great promise for engineered materials and nanoscale devices. Here, we characterize experimentally {{the effects of a}} single <b>defect</b> on <b>electrons</b> and phonons in single-wall carbon nanotubes. The effects demonstrated here are unusual in that they are not caused by defect-induced symmetry breaking. Electrons and phonons are strongly coupled in sp 2 carbon systems, and a defect causes renormalization of electron and phonon energies. We find that near a negatively charged <b>defect,</b> the <b>electron</b> velocity is increased, which in turn influences lattice vibrations locally. Combining measurements on nanotube ensembles and on single nanotubes, we capture the relation between atomic response and the readily accessible macroscopic behaviour. Interest in the fundamental and applied properties of sp 2 -hybridized carbon nanomaterials such as nanotubes, nanohorns, nanoribbons and sheets centres on their uniqu...|$|R
