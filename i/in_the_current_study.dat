[...] <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>study</b> subjects (93) {{were distributed to}} 2 groups, 46 {{were randomly assigned to}} mantra group and 47 to control group. Participants of the mantra group demonstrate a decrease in intrusive thoughts, anger, stress level.

30|$|Other {{limitations}} are {{that most women}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>study</b> had a normal BMI {{and the proportion of}} women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>study</b> with pre-pregnancy overweight or obesity was smaller than among women of childbearing age in Sweden in general. The GWG for the women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>study</b> seems to be a slightly lower compared to nationwide registry data (Holowko et al. 2014), but this could be {{explained by the fact that}} body weight of women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>study</b> were weighed in gestational week 36 and not at term. Also, PAL <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>study</b> was measured using a subjective method which could be considered a limitation. Excessive GWG in this study was defined in accordance with the IOM guidelines. These recommendations were created for the American pregnant population but Nordic data is included in the report, and the guidelines are likely to be relevant also in a Swedish population. The participants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>study</b> reported consuming more fruit and berries, bread, fish, dairy, juice and sugared beverages, but less red meat compared to the corresponding Swedish female population (31 – 44  years of age) in a large nationwide dietary survey (Amcoff et al. 2012). In addition, participants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>study</b> had higher education than the general population. Therefore, this sample of pregnant women may not be representative of the general population of pregnant women in Sweden.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} check the {{feasibility}} of the BFGS preconditioners, we investigate the convergence rate of the GCR with conventional preconditioners and <b>the</b> BFGS preconditoners. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>studies,</b> <b>the</b> diagonal scaling and the SSOR are employed as conventional preconditioners, and the BFGS and the L-BFGS are newly developed preconditioners. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> cases of BFGS and L-BFGS, the choice of initial Hessian matrices remains an issue. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>studies,</b> <b>the</b> diagonal scaling preconditioner is employed as an initial Hessian matrix for the BFGS and the L-BFGS, and the SSOR preconditioner is employed for the L-BFGS as well. <b>In</b> addition, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of the L-BFGS, we must determine m, which {{is the number of}} previous iterations to be taken into consideration. Unfortunately, with our best knowledge, there is no obvious rule on the choice of m even for the L-BFGS as a nonlinear equation solver. Therefore, we investigate the convergence rate with various m i.e. m = 3, 5, 7, and 10. The algorithms of each preconditioner are given <b>in</b> <b>the</b> “Methods” section <b>in</b> this article.|$|R
