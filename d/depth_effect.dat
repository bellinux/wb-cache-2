40|$|AbstractBased on a {{model of}} {{transverse}} chromatic aberration (TCA) of the eye and perceptual effects previously discussed by the same author, {{it was predicted that}} colour induced binocular depth perception (chromostereopsis) is possible from images containing red or blue along with achromatic information (grey and black); that the direction of the perceived depth from certain colours should differ for the same TCA conditions; and that a greater depth perception should be possible in a blue/achromatic image than a red/achromatic image. Results of TCA manipulations support all three predictions and demonstrate that colour induced <b>depth</b> <b>effects</b> can be perceived in images having only achromatic information and a single non-achromatic colour. It is argued that optical factors, image characteristics and perceptual factors all {{play an important role in}} colour <b>depth</b> <b>effects</b> under natural viewing conditions. Further, the possibility is raised that colour and texture patterns which produce colour <b>depth</b> <b>effects</b> have evolved within certain species for camouflage or other behavioural purposes...|$|R

But if the cube rotates, the visual system will extract the necessary information for perception of the third dimension from the movements of the lines, and a cube is seen. This is an example of the kinetic <b>depth</b> <b>effect.</b> The effect also occurs when the rotating object is solid (rather than an outline figure), provided that the projected shadow consists of lines which have definite corners or end points, and that these lines change in both length and orientation during the rotation.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} model the {{calculation}} of depth values from relative movement, many efforts {{have been made to}} infer these values using other information like geometry and measurements of objects and their positions.

50|$|As {{with other}} depth cues, the kinetic <b>depth</b> <b>effect</b> {{is almost always}} {{produced}} {{in combination with other}} effects, most notably the motion parallax effect.

The observed gamma-ray distribution can be explained best by models with a flattened halo distribution of axis ratio ~ 0. 3.

5000|$|Evidence for the stereoptic {{effect is}} often quite easy to see. For example, when {{red and blue}} are viewed {{side by side on}} a dark surrounding, most people will view the red as [...] "floating" [...] in front of the blue. However, this is not true for everyone, as some people see the {{opposite}} and others no effect at all. This is the same effect that both Goethe and De Wilde had indicated in their observations. While a majority of people will view red as [...] "floating" [...] in front of blue, others experience a reversal of the effect in which they see blue floating in front of the red, or no <b>depth</b> <b>effect</b> at all. While this reversal may appear to discredit chromostereopsis, it does not and instead, as originally proposed by Einthoven, can be explained by an increase in the effect and subsequent reversal via blocking of the eccentric position of the pupil with respect to the optical axis.The diverse nature of the chromostereoptic effect is because the color <b>depth</b> <b>effect</b> is closely intertwined with both perceptual and optical factors. In other words, neither the optical nor the perceptual factors can be taken in insolation to explain chromostereopsis. This multifactorial component of chromostereopsis offers one explanation of the reversal of the effect in different people given the same visual cues.|$|E

50|$|In 1963, Wallach, Moore and Davidson artificially {{increased}} disparity {{by having}} subjects look through a telestereoscope, a device {{which uses a}} mirror arrangement to simulate an increased distance between the eyes. When they viewed a wireform cube through the telestereoscope, subjects reported that the cube’s depth appeared greater than its width and height, {{a result of the}} greater disparity generated by the telestereoscope. After this, the cube was made to rotate slowly while the subjects watched. This created a conflict between two depth cues: while the artificially-increased disparity was indicating that the cube’s depth was greater than its other two dimensions, the kinetic <b>depth</b> <b>effect</b> (which is not affected by disparity) was presenting cues consistent with a normal rotating cube, of equal size on all sides.|$|E
5000|$|Over {{two centuries}} ago, {{the effect of}} color depth {{perception}} was first noted by Goethe in his Farbenlehre (Theory of Colours) in which he recognized blue as a receding color and yellow/red as a protruding color. He argued that, [...] "like we see the high sky, the far away mountains, as blue, {{in the same way}} a blue field seems to recede…(also) One can stare at a perfectly yellow/red field, then the color seems to pierce into the organ". This phenomenon, now referred to as chromostereopsis, or the stereoptic effect, explains the visual science behind this color <b>depth</b> <b>effect,</b> and has many implications for art, media, evolution, as well as our daily lives in how we perceive colors and objects.|$|E
5000|$|Objects at 25 to 30 feet, {{instead of}} having the subtle depth that one being there would see, or what would be {{recorded}} with a normal baseline, will have the much more dramatic depth that would be seen from 7 to 10 feet.

In other words, the baseline is chosen to produce the same <b>depth</b> <b>effect,</b> regardless of the distance from the subject. As with true ortho, this effect is impossible to achieve in a literal sense, since different objects in the scene will be at different distances and will thus show different amounts of parallax, but the geometric stereographer, like the ortho stereographer attempts to come as close as possible.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe goal of {{the present}} study is to compare the {{strengths}} of <b>depth</b> <b>effects</b> induced by different types of vertical disparity. We use a nulling task, in which the <b>depth</b> <b>effects</b> induced by vertical disparity are nulled by horizontal disparity. The advantage of this method is that it prevents cue conflicts from arising between disparity and other depth cues. The ratios between horizontal and vertical disparity that evoke the percept of a fronto-parallel stimulus vary per type of vertical disparity. The ratios determined for vertical scale and vertical quadratic mix (vertical scale with a horizontal gradient) vary strongly across subjects. The ratios for vertical shear are constant, since all subjects needed the same amount of horizontal and vertical shear to perceive a fronto-parallel plane. In these experiments, one conflict cannot be avoided, namely the conflict between vertical disparity and oculomotor signals. This conflict may cause differential weighting of vertical disparity and oculomotor signals, which could explain the individual differences. The different ratios for different types of vertical disparity suggest that weighting is specific for each type of vertical disparity and the associated oculomotor signal...|$|R
40|$|While {{experiments}} on metals {{have been performed}} {{since the early days}} of NMR (and DNP), the use of bulk metal is normally avoided. Instead, often powders have been used in combination with low fields, so that skin <b>depth</b> <b>effects</b> could be neglected. Another complicating factor of acquiring NMR spectra or MRI images of bulk metal is the strong signal dependence on the orientation between the sample and the radio frequency (RF) coil, leading to non-intuitive image distortions and inaccurate quantification. Such factors are particularly important for NMR and MRI of batteries and other electrochemical devices. Here, we show results from a systematic study combining RF field calculations with experimental MRI of $^ 7 $Li metal to visualize skin <b>depth</b> <b>effects</b> directly and to analyze the RF field orientation effect on MRI of bulk metal. It is shown that a certain degree of selectivity can be achieved for particular faces of the metal, simply based on the orientation of the sample. By combining RF field calculations with bulk magnetic susceptibility calculations accurate NMR spectra can be obtained from first principles. Such analyses will become valuable in many applications involving battery systems, but also metals, in general...|$|R
