5|$|Financial {{integration}} among {{industrialized nations}} grew substantially during the 1980s and 1990s, as did liberalization of their capital accounts. Integration among financial markets and banks rendered {{benefits such as}} greater productivity and the broad sharing of risk in the macroeconomy. The resulting interdependence also carried a substantive cost in terms of shared vulnerabilities and increased exposure to systemic risks. Accompanying financial integration in recent decades was a succession of deregulation, in which countries increasingly abandoned regulations over the behavior of financial intermediaries and simplified requirements of disclosure {{to the public and}} to regulatory authorities. As economies became more open, nations became increasingly exposed to external shocks. Economists have argued greater worldwide financial integration has resulted in more volatile capital flows, thereby increasing the potential for financial market turbulence. Given greater integration among nations, a systemic crisis in one can easily infect others. The 1980s and 1990s saw a wave of currency crises and sovereign defaults, including the 1987 Black Monday stock market crashes, 1992 <b>European</b> <b>Monetary</b> <b>System</b> crisis, 1994 Mexican peso crisis, 1997 Asian currency crisis, 1998 Russian financial crisis, and the 1998–2002 Argentine peso crisis. These crises differed in terms of their breadth, causes, and aggravations, among which were capital flights brought about by speculative attacks on fixed exchange rate currencies perceived to be mispriced given a nation's fiscal policy, self-fulfilling speculative attacks by investors expecting other investors to follow suit given doubts about a nation's currency peg, lack of access to developed and functioning domestic capital markets in emerging market countries, and current account reversals during conditions of limited capital mobility and dysfunctional banking systems.|$|E
5|$|Following the Smithsonian Agreement, {{member states}} of the European Economic Community adopted a {{narrower}} currency band of 1.125% for exchange rates among their own currencies, creating a smaller scale fixed exchange rate system known as the snake in the tunnel. The snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel EEC countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies. In 1979, the <b>European</b> <b>Monetary</b> <b>System</b> (EMS) phased out the currency snake. The EMS featured two key components: the European Currency Unit (ECU), an artificial weighted average market basket of European Union members' currencies, and the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), a procedure for managing exchange rate fluctuations in keeping with a calculated parity grid of currencies' par values. The parity grid was derived from parities each participating country established for its currency with all other currencies in the system, denominated in terms of ECUs. The weights within the ECU changed in response to variances in the values of each currency in its basket. Under the ERM, if an exchange rate reached its upper or lower limit (within a 2.25% band), both nations in that currency pair were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign exchange market and buy or sell the under- or overvalued currency as necessary to return the exchange rate to its par value according to the parity matrix. The requirement of cooperative market intervention marked a key difference from the Bretton Woods system. Similarly to Bretton Woods however, EMS members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible for exchange rates approaching their bounds, as identified by a divergence indicator which measured deviations from the ECU's value. The central exchange rates of the parity grid could be adjusted in exceptional circumstances, and were modified every eight months on average during the systems' initial four years of operation. During its twenty-year lifespan, these central rates were adjusted over 50 times.|$|E

40|$|Contemporaries, and {{economic}} historians, have noted several features of medieval and early mod-ern <b>European</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>systems</b> {{that are hard}} to analyze using models of centralized exchange. For example, contemporaries complained of recurrent shortages of small change and argued that an abundance/dearth of money had real effects on exchange. To confront these facts, we build a random matching monetary model with two indivisible coins with different intrinsic values. The model shows that small change shortages can exist in the sense that adding small coins to an economy with only large coins is welfare improving, This effect is amplified by increases in trading opportunities. Further, changes in the quantity of monetary metals affect the real economy and the amount of exchange as well as the optimal denomination size. Finally, the model shows that replacing full-bodied small coins with tokens is not necessarily welfare improving...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the rising}} {{divergence}} in sectoral wage moderation within <b>European</b> <b>Monetary</b> Union (EMU) member states since {{the introduction of}} the Euro is examined. During the 1980 s and 1990 s, wage restraint cycles between exposed, manufacturing sectors, and sheltered, private services sectors within EMU candidate-countries were highly synchronous, and differences in wage inflation between sectors within countries was low. After 1996, significant divergence in sectoral wage inflation emerged, and synchronicity of wage restraint cycles between sectors collapsed after 1999. This paper will address the question of why divergence occurred between sectoral wage restraint within EMU countries after 1996. It will be argued that monetary union’s removal of national exchange rate pegs and inflation criteria, and the central banks that enforced them, accentuated wage preference divergence between actors in the exposed and sheltered sectors, enabling unions in sheltered sectors to push for high wage increases while unions in more exposed sectors had to continue with wage moderation due to competitiveness constraints. Unlike some political science literature that assumes powerful, protected sectors produce excessive wage inflation {{at the expense of the}} exposed sector, it will be argued that the <b>European</b> <b>Monetary</b> <b>System’s</b> fixed exchange rate arrangements, and more importantly the Maastricht inflation criteria, provided an effective monetary constraint on sheltered sector wage growth, keeping sheltered sector wage moderation in line with wage restraint developments in the exposed sector in the 1980 s and early 1990 s...|$|R
25|$|Until the 19th century, {{the global}} <b>monetary</b> <b>system</b> was loosely linked at best, with Europe, the Americas, India and China (among others) having largely {{separate}} economies, and hence <b>monetary</b> <b>systems</b> were regional. <b>European</b> colonization of the Americas, {{starting with the}} Spanish empire, led to the integration of American and <b>European</b> economies and <b>monetary</b> <b>systems,</b> and <b>European</b> colonization of Asia led to the dominance of European currencies, notably the British pound sterling in the 19th century, succeeded by the US dollar in the 20th century.
