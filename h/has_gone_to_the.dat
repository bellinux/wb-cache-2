5|$|Hubert Humphrey brought {{national}} {{attention to the}} state with his address at the 1948 Democratic National Convention. Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since 1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota {{is the only state}} in the nation that did not vote for Ronald Reagan in either of his presidential runs. Minnesota <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1960, with the exception of 1972, when it was carried by Richard Nixon and the Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|Distributed in most territories by 20th Century Fox, The Great Silence was theatrically {{released}} to a mediocre commercial reception in Italy, but it fared better in other countries. The film was withheld from release in the United States until 2001, {{when it was}} made available on DVD by Fantoma Films and Image Entertainment. Controversial for its bleak and dark tone, the film's reputation grew, and it gained a cult following {{in the wake of}} its release. The Great Silence is now widely regarded by fans and authorities on Spaghetti Westerns {{as one of the greatest}} films of the genre, and is acknowledged as Corbucci's masterpiece. Praise <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> acting, the utilization of snowbound landscapes, Ennio Morricone's score, and the film's subversion of several conventions of the Western film genre.|$|E

King Tommen Baratheon, Joffrey's eight-year-old brother, now rules in King's Landing under his mother, Cersei Lannister. Brienne, the Maid of Tarth, {{is on a mission}} to find Sansa Stark, aided by Jaime Lannister. Sansa is hiding in the Vale, {{protected}} by Petyr Baelish, who has murdered his wife Lysa Arryn and named himself Protector of the Vale and guardian of eight-year-old Lord Robert Arryn.|$|E
25|$|The Damned {{are taken}} to Hell and {{received}} by Demons is {{in stark contrast to}} the previous one. Signorelli <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> extremes of his fantasy and evocative powers to portray his cataclysmic vision of the horrible fate, the agony and the despair of the damned. He uses the naked human body as his only expressive element, showing the isolated bodies entangling each other, merging in a convoluted mass. They are overpowered by demons in near-human form, depicted in colours of every shade of decomposing flesh. Above them, a flying demon transports a woman. This is probably a depiction of the Whore of the Apocalypse.|$|E
25|$|Linux {{distributions}} {{have also}} gained popularity with various {{local and national}} governments. The federal government of Brazil {{is well known for}} its support for Linux. News of the Russian military creating its own Linux distribution has also surfaced, and has come to fruition as the G.H.ost Project. The Indian state of Kerala <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> extent of mandating that all state high schools run Linux on their computers. China uses Linux exclusively as the operating system for its Loongson processor family to achieve technology independence. In Spain, some regions have developed their own Linux distributions, which are widely used in education and official institutions, like gnuLinEx in Extremadura and Guadalinex in Andalusia. France and Germany have also taken steps toward the adoption of Linux. North Korea's Red Star OS, developed since 2002, is based on a version of Fedora Linux.|$|E

500|$|... "The Revenge" [...] {{was first}} {{read by the}} cast of the show on February 13, 1991 and was filmed {{in front of a}} live {{audience}} on February 20, 1991. Filming of the episode had been delayed two days due to President's Day. Both Alexander and Louis-Dreyfus praised the scene in which Jerry and George discuss the types of employment George could apply for after he quit his job. Louis-Dreyfus stated she was jealous that she was not in the scene. A number of scenes in the episode were removed prior to broadcast, such as one in which George and Kramer meet in the hallway and Kramer informs George that Jerry <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> laundromat. The writers decided that George could just say Kramer told him Jerry was at the laundromat and, upon that addition, the scene was cut. Initially, during Jerry and George's conversation about jobs, George mentions Regis Philbin, when they discuss George being a talk show host. Additional dialogue between George and Jerry at the laundromat was also removed. Because the episode [...] "The Stranded" [...] did not air until mid season three, the few references [...] "The Revenge" [...] contained to the episode, were cut. The Newman subplot was significantly reduced; the character initially appeared in one scene, but it was never filmed. In that scene, he would have explained to Jerry and Kramer that he jumped from the roof, but an awning broke his fall, though Jerry and Kramer would remain skeptical. The episode also involved the second appearance of Harold the building superintendent, who had previously appeared in [...] "The Apartment". Harold would inform the main characters that Newman made up the story about the awning breaking his fall, though, with the reduction of the Newman subplot, the scene was removed.|$|E

[...] He went on to claim that Le Pen won 18% of the vote by campaigning to pull France out of the euro and, with reference to a poll finding only 3% of French voters consider immigration the main issue, that the National Front cannot owe its popularity to the issue.
