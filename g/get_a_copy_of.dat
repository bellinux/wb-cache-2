5|$|The {{authenticity}} of the casket letters has {{been the source of}} much controversy among historians. It is impossible now to prove either way. The originals, written in French, were probably destroyed in 1584 by Mary's son. The surviving copies, in French or translated into English, do not form a complete set. There are incomplete printed transcriptions in English, Scots, French, and Latin from the 1570s. Other documents scrutinised included Bothwell's divorce from Jean Gordon. Moray had sent a messenger in September to Dunbar to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> the proceedings from the town's registers.|$|E

They also made the v1.1 patch available for download. The gaming press lauded Bungie's handling of the situation, praising their decision to take the financial hit and recall the game.|$|E
25|$|Machine-readable {{passports}} {{originally had}} no signature field, {{a source of}} much controversy as Filipinos applying for foreign visas, whether for travel or employment, have either been requested to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> their passport application form to verify their signature, or denied altogether. Newer versions of this passport eventually had the signature field at the back cover, below the important reminders for Philippine passport holders, while older versions have the field stamped on.|$|E

This may result in daughter cells with differential proportions of organelle genotypes.|$|R
25|$|The Clinton Community Garden, a {{neighborhood}} garden, {{is a result}} of the actors living in the area. Since they mostly work at night in the local theatres, they took time to create a garden in what was then a rubble-strewn lot on West 48th Street between Ninth and Tenth avenues Eventually it contributed to the area's gentrification.

25|$|Information {{provided}} in koseki is detailed and sensitive and makes discrimination possible against such groups as burakumin or illegitimate children and unwed mothers, for example. As the burakumin liberation movement gained strength in postwar Japan some {{changes were made}} to family registries. In 1974 a notice that prohibited employers from asking prospective employees to show their family registry was released by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. In 1975 one's lineage name was deleted and in 1976 access to family registries was restricted. As of April 2007, anyone interested was eligible to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> someone else's koseki. However, on May 1, 2008, a new law was implemented to limit the persons eligible for a copy to the persons whose names are recorded in a given koseki and those who need such a copy to exercise their due rights (debt collectors, executors of wills). Anyone who is listed on a koseki, even if their name has been crossed off by reason of divorce {{and even if they}} are not a Japanese citizen, is eligible to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> that koseki. One can obtain a copy in person or by mail. Lawyers can also obtain copies of any koseki if a person listed is involved in legal proceedings.|$|E
25|$|A {{whiteboard}} grid {{is used to}} plan episodes a {{few weeks}} in advance, based on release schedules, events like E3, interviews, and other segments. They try to time reviews so they occur before or in the week the game is released, however, being a television show with a longer production period than most online content, {{this is not always}} possible. One challenge is having publishers provide games early enough to be reviewed and filmed in time. Often they receive debug code which can only be played on debug consoles, and developers are usually still working out kinks, so will provide a list of bugs for the team to take into account. Good Game also have to be wary of embargo dates as reviews can't be broadcast before then. Even if the embargo ends a few hours after a Good game episode, the review must be held back for a week. Sometimes, Good Game can only <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> the game after it is released, and Bajo points out that while this is sometimes due to random factors it can also be a sign that the game is bad. They try to avoid having too many of the same type of game in each week, and try to include games on all consoles. They hope that all this will ensure there is something for everyone.|$|E

5|$|Modern historians, however, {{doubt the}} {{veracity}} of this theory. For one thing, notes Kenneth R. Beesley, the Deseret News and every book published in the alphabet prominently feature {{the key to the}} alphabet, and anyone without a key could have <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> Journey to Great-Salt-Lake City, or traveled to Salt Lake City themselves and bought one.

500|$|Since its introduction, the {{effectiveness}} of the Parental Advisory label has frequently been called into question. Jon Wiederhorn from MTV News suggested that artists benefited from the label and noted that younger customers interested in explicit content could more easily find it with a label attached. On behalf of Westword, Andy Thomas implied that the label was purposeless on the grounds that a young customer [...] "would <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> the album sooner or later from a friend or another lethargic record store clerk" [...] like the cashier that sold him a labeled pressing of [...] (1992) by White Zombie in his childhood. He noted that its intended reaction in parents was varied; his lax mother was indifferent towards the warning, while the mother of his stricter companion did not allow her child to listen to the record.|$|E
500|$|Doing another {{appearance}} on Taylor Reid's news show, C.J. gets blind-sided with news about resigned Vice President John Hoynes. A New York Times interview leaked {{on the internet}} has him claiming the President and Leo asked him to stay once the sex scandal broke (which, as seen on Life on Mars, is true). C.J. manages to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> the interview, and {{it becomes clear that}} he is trying to portray his former boss and the Chief of Staff in a bad light. When it also emerges that he is writing a book (titled [...] "Full Disclosure"), the White House staff suspect he is planning a presidential run, and that his tactics will involve a smear campaign against the current administration, to distance himself and thereby appear in a better light. As a pre-emptive response, they draw up a long and detailed list of Hoynes' worst policy blunders from his time in office, to use if he should decide to campaign at their expense.|$|E

50|$|The {{second type}} of shared {{applications}} are multi-user 2D Java applications.

Users can then either synchronize with the presenter or navigate through the slides independently. Another example is the shared whiteboard. This allows multiple users {{to draw on the}} board at the same time.
