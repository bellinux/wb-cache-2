60|$|Accordingly, the {{arrangements}} were all made for Rollo's departure the next day, with his uncle George, for New Haven. Jennie {{finally decided to}} go with her father and mother. The idea of sailing at midnight determined her; for such an adventure, attractive as it was in Rollo's eyes, seemed quite formidable in hers. Rollo had a very pleasant ride to New Haven, amusing himself all the way with the beauties of English scenery and the continual novelties that every where met his eye. When they at last arrived at New Haven, they found that the harbor consisted merely of a straight, artificial canal, cut in from the sea, where probably some small stream had originally issued. The sides of this harbor were lined with piers, and on one of the piers was a great hotel, forming a part, as it were, of the railway station. There were a few houses and other buildings near, but there was no town to be seen. The railway was {{on one side of the}} hotel, and the water was on the other. When the train stopped, one of the railway servants opened the door for Mr. George and Rollo to get out, and Mr. George went directly into the hotel to make arrangements for rooms and for dinner, while Rollo, eager to see the ships and the water, went through the <b>house</b> <b>to</b> the <b>pier</b> on the other side. He found that there was a pretty broad space on the pier, between the hotel and the water, with a shed upon it for merchandise, and extra tracks for freight trains. The water was quite low in the harbor, and the few vessels that were lying at the pier walls were mostly grounded in the mud. There was one steamboat lying opposite the hotel, but it was down so low that, at first, Rollo could only see the top of the smoke-pipe. Rollo went to the brink of the pier and looked down. The steamer appeared very small. It was painted black. There were very few people on board. Rollo had a great mind to go on board himself, as there was a plank leading down from the <b>pier</b> <b>to</b> the top of the paddle box. But it looked rather steep, and so Rollo concluded to postpone going on board till Mr. George should come out with him after dinner.|$|R

50|$|After a {{brief period}} of repairs, Auburn shifted <b>to</b> <b>pier</b> 16, South Brooklyn, on the 17th.

25|$|Workers {{repeat the}} entire process three more times until the ice pier is {{approximately}} 6.7m (22ft) thick. Wooden utility poles drilled about four deep into the final ice pier support electrical and telephone service <b>to</b> the <b>pier.</b> Moreover, during the final construction phase, personnel mount shorter poles in the ice edge to serve as bollards <b>to</b> secure the <b>pier</b> <b>to</b> the shore at McMurdo.
