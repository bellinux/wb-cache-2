5|$|Although C# {{applications}} {{are intended to}} be <b>economical</b> with regard to memory and processing power requirements, the language {{was not intended to}} compete directly on performance and size with C or assembly language.|$|E
5|$|Buses are {{generally}} favoured for commuting {{short to medium}} distances, while train fares are more <b>economical</b> for longer distance commutes.|$|E
5|$|Since the 17th {{century the}} first step in European steel {{production}} has been the smelting of iron ore into pig iron in a blast furnace. Originally employing charcoal, modern methods use coke, which has proven more <b>economical.</b>|$|E
5|$|Soil {{is still}} an <b>economical</b> {{material}} for many applications, and may have low environmental impact both during and after construction.|$|E
5|$|Soybean oil, not <b>economical</b> as a fuel crop, but {{appealing}} as {{a byproduct}} of soybean crops for other uses.|$|E
5|$|Zinc: {{the easiest}} metal to cast; high ductility; high impact strength; easily plated; <b>economical</b> for small parts; {{promotes}} long die life.|$|E
5|$|As of 2009, {{graphene}} {{appears to}} be the strongest material ever tested. The process of separating it from graphite will require some further technological development before it is <b>economical</b> for industrial processes. If successful, graphene could be used in the construction of a space elevator. It could also be used to safely store hydrogen for use in a hydrogen based engine in cars.|$|E
5|$|Because {{there are}} no other large cities in the Republic of Macedonia, and because of {{political}} and <b>economical</b> centralisation, a large number of Macedonians living outside of Skopje work in the capital city. The dynamism of the city also encourages rural exodus, not only from Macedonia, but also from Kosovo, Albania and Southern Serbia.|$|E
5|$|Before the Test series began, the West Indian cricket team played three One Day Internationals against England in May 1988. All of the ODIs were won by England, largely {{thanks to}} disciplined, <b>economical</b> bowling by Gladstone Small, Phil DeFreitas and Derek Pringle {{throughout}} and good batting performances from Mike Gatting in the First (82*) and Third (40*) ODIs. England retained the Texaco Trophy.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s, {{developments}} {{in the pattern of}} oil transportation indicated that it would soon become most <b>economical</b> to move oil between the Middle East and Europe using ultra large crude carrier (ULCC) vessels. These vessels were so large {{that they would not be}} able to enter most of the older ports on the Atlantic Ocean, North Sea, and English Channel coasts.|$|E
5|$|Northamptonshire {{entered the}} {{competition}} in the second round, {{in which they were}} drawn against Surrey County Cricket Club. They won the match by six wickets, aided by a century from Geoff Cook which earned him the man of the match award. In the quarter-finals, they beat Leicestershire by eight wickets, with particularly <b>economical</b> bowling from Sarfraz Nawaz and Richard Williams helping to limit their opponents to 180, a total which Northamptonshire reached with 4.2 overs to spare. Northamptonshire batted first during their semi-final against Sussex, a match which they won by 37 runs. Allan Lamb and Peter Willey shared a partnership of 157 for the fourth wicket, and Willey's <b>economical</b> bowling was then instrumental in restricting Sussex to 218, for which he was named man of the match.|$|E
5|$|Overall, Fleet Air Arm {{casualties}} during Operation Goodwood were 40 airmen {{killed and}} 17 aircraft destroyed. Nabob was also {{judged to be}} beyond <b>economical</b> repair, and was withdrawn from service. On the German side, Tirpitz suffered only superficial damage.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{years have}} seen changes as bigger leaner {{carcasses}} were demanded. This issue of size featured in Galloway circles causes great debate. Some of the adjustments made was the adoption of AI and Embryo Transfer. Today the breed's original characteristics are now back in demand. This {{is due to the}} demand of high quality meat that requires <b>economical</b> production.|$|E
5|$|Sales for Super Cubs have {{increased}} in Japan with upgrades to the engine and the installation of fuel injection for Japanese domestic market models starting from 2007, making it more powerful, more <b>economical</b> and cleaner. With respect to newer, plastic body underbone designs, such as the Wave, the original Cub remains popular.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{differ on}} why the order was issued, speculating that the company wanted the land for a dump site, no longer wanted to tend to the town's maintenance, or decided it was not <b>economical</b> to own houses anymore. No one in {{authority}} revealed {{what was to become}} of the land.|$|E
5|$|Such vast cargoes {{would be}} carried by boat {{as far as}} possible, by sea and/or river, and only the {{shortest}} possible distance overland. That is because transport on water was far more <b>economical</b> than on land (as it remains today, although the differential is smaller).|$|E
5|$|Switzerland {{developed}} an efficient system to recycle old newspapers and cardboard materials. Publicly organised collection by volunteers and <b>economical</b> railway transport logistics started {{as early as}} 1865 {{under the leadership of}} the notable industrialist Hans Caspar Escher (Escher Wyss AG) when the first modern Swiss paper manufacturing plant was built in Biberist.|$|E
5|$|The A, B, and C {{prototype}} models all coupled {{an external}} Beckman pH meter to the optical component to obtain readouts. In developing the Model D, Beckman took the direct-coupled amplifier circuit from the pH meter and combined the optical and electronic components {{in a single}} housing, making it more <b>economical.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Civic Party {{accused the}} {{government}} of misleading the public: the development plans for the North Island Line precluded the restoration the pier before 2016. Christine Loh criticised Donald Tsang for failing to grasp the <b>economical,</b> cultural and social importance of heritage.|$|E
5|$|The Government tasks the Prime Minister, the First Vice-Prime Minister for Economy and Minister of Finance, Minister of Interior, Minister of Defense, Minister of Industry and Trade, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Agriculture and Minister of Labor and Social Affairs to (1) conduct {{any and all}} procedural, {{political}} and diplomatic measures necessary to prevent adoption of such a proposal of European Directive, that would amend the Directive No. 91/477/EEC {{in a way which}} would excessively affect the rights of the citizens of the Czech Republic and which would have negative effect on internal order, defense capabilities and <b>economical</b> or labor situation in the Czech Republic and (2) enforce such changes to the proposal of directive that would amend the directive no. 91/477/EEC that will allow preservation of the current level of civil rights of citizens of the Czech Republic and which will prevent negative impact on internal order, defense capabilities and <b>economical</b> and labor situation in the Czech Republic.|$|E
5|$|The Simca Vedette {{is a large}} car, {{manufactured}} from 1954 to 1961 by the French automaker Simca, {{at their}} factory in Poissy, France. It was marketed with different model names according to trim and equipment levels. The Vedette was Simca's largest model {{at that time and}} it spawned a more <b>economical</b> version, the Simca Ariane.|$|E
5|$|The finale {{completes the}} {{interconnectedness}} {{of the work}} with a theme audibly {{similar to those of}} the first movement and the minuet and trio. The movement is the most <b>economical</b> of all: the exposition and development commence with nearly identical passages and conclude in exactly the same way.|$|E
5|$|The last train ran on 4 July 1991, {{four days}} after the plant closed. Without {{production}} at the plants {{there was no need for}} the railway; it would be more <b>economical</b> to transport the few last products by truck. The final hauled several wagons down to the coast for scrapping. The closing of the Rjukan Line also terminated operations on the Tinnoset Line, where passenger traffic had remained until 1991.|$|E
5|$|The reduced length while {{retaining}} the same beam as the prior Connecticut class {{resulted in a}} disadvantageous length-to-beam ratio, causing reduced performance relative to that class. Not only was their top speed a knot slower, but also their <b>economical</b> speed was reduced by one and half knots. They also had 25% less coal storage, further reducing their operating range.|$|E
5|$|The {{songs on}} Obscured by Clouds are all short and <b>economical,</b> in {{contrast}} to the lengthy instrumentals found on other Floyd albums. A strong country music influence was present on several tracks, with prominent use of acoustic guitar. The album also featured the VCS 3 synthesizer, which Wright had purchased from the BBC Radiophonic Workshop.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two primary}} centres of <b>economical</b> {{activity}} in Southcoteâ€”Coronation Square and Southcote Farm Lane. Coronation Square {{is home to}} a number of commercial and community premises, including a post office, takeaway food outlets, newsagents, healthcare businesses and a pet shop; as well as a community centre and library. The square also featured a public house until its demolition in 2011; the land was subsequently used for affordable housing.|$|E
5|$|Whereas Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) or Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) {{are typical}} data-link {{protocols}} for larger networks such as WANs; Ethernet and Token Ring are typical data-link protocols for LANs. These protocols {{differ from the}} former protocols {{in that they are}} simpler, e.g., they omit features such as quality of service guarantees, and offer collision prevention. Both of these differences allow for more <b>economical</b> systems.|$|E
5|$|After the Gold Rush had concluded, gold {{recovery}} operations continued. The final stage to recover loose gold was to prospect for gold that had slowly washed {{down into the}} flat river bottoms and sandbars of California's Central Valley and other gold-bearing areas of California (such as Scott Valley in Siskiyou County). By the late 1890s, dredging technology (also invented in California) had become <b>economical,</b> and {{it is estimated that}} more than 20million ounces (620t) were recovered by dredging (worth approximately US$28billion at December 2010 prices).|$|E
5|$|By 1801 the {{population}} of the Minster-in-Sheppey parish, which included both Sheerness and the neighbouring town of Minster, reached 5,561. In 1816, one of the UK's first co-operative societies was started in Sheerness, chiefly to serve the dockyard workers and their families. The Sheerness <b>Economical</b> Society began as a co-operative bakery but expanded to produce and sell a range of goods. By the middle of the 20th century, the society had spread across the Isle of Sheppey and had been renamed the Sheerness and District Cooperative Society.|$|E
5|$|Frederick William {{took over}} Brandenburg-Prussia {{in times of}} a political, <b>economical</b> and {{demographic}} crisis caused by the war. Upon his succession, the new elector retired the Brandenburgian army, but had an army raised again in 1643/44. Whether or not Frederick William concluded a truce and neutrality agreement with Sweden is disputed: while a relevant 1641 document exists, it was never ratified and has repeatedly {{been described as a}} falsification. However, it is not disputed that he established the growth of Brandenburg-Prussia.|$|E
5|$|Galba {{may have}} chosen to award Halotus the lucrative procuratorship {{for any number of}} reasons; during his reign, Galba was known for making often unpopular {{political}} and <b>economical</b> actions, supposedly for what was, at least in Galba's mind, the financial health of the city. Halotus' great rise in status, and his subsequent prosperity, may have been in some way beneficial in Galba's eyes. Less specifically, the move would certainly have had some degree of benefit for Galba in some way, whether indirectly, or directly, economically or financially.|$|E
5|$|In 1834, in British Guiana, a German physician, Carl Warburg, invented an {{antipyretic}} medicine: 'Warburg's Tincture'. This secret, proprietary remedy contained quinine {{and other}} herbs. Trials {{were made in}} Europe in the 1840s and 1850s. It was officially adopted by the Austrian Empire in 1847. It was considered by many eminent medical professionals {{to be a more}} efficacious antimalarial than quinine. It was also more <b>economical.</b> The British Government supplied Warburg's Tincture to troops in India and other colonies.|$|E
5|$|In 1975 the {{university}} changed again its organizational structure into Faculties, and new programs were created, for example Social Communication and Journalism, Social Work {{were established in}} the Faculty of Humanities. In 1977, {{in order to avoid}} the desertion of several faculty members, it was established the professorship career system based in academic, investigative, and administrative merits. In 1976, with the creation of the Socio <b>Economical</b> Research Center, the first steps into the creation of the Sociology program in 1978 were taken.|$|E
5|$|In March 2007, a {{proposal}} to establish a station at Valby, where the Carlsberg Group is planning an urban redevelopment, was scrapped. The proposal would have increased construction costs by DKK900million and was deemed not <b>economical.</b> The increased cost was, in part, due to an extra TBM being needed to complete the project on time. The City Circle Line was passed by parliament on 1 June 2007, with only the Redâ€“Green Alliance voting in disfavor.|$|E
5|$|In early March 1947, Formidable steamed {{north to}} Rosyth {{for a brief}} refit before being reduced to reserve. She was paid off on 12 August and a later survey {{revealed}} that her wartime damage and poor material shape meant the ship was beyond <b>economical</b> repair {{at a time when}} money was very tight. She was towed to Spithead in mid-1949 and then to Portsmouth Royal Dockyard in November 1952. Formidable was sold for scrap in January 1953 and towed to Inverkeithing where she was broken up.|$|E
5|$|Motorcycle {{engineer}} Norbert Riedel {{recognized the}} need for a simple and <b>economical</b> light motorcycle during Germany's recovery from the Second World War and began to design one. By the summer of 1947, a prototype frame had been built and tested. The spine frame was made from 40mm steel tubing, as were the steering head, the single-sided front fork, and the single-sided swingarm. The wheels were interchangeable, and were mounted from the left on stub axles attached to the suspension on the right.|$|E
