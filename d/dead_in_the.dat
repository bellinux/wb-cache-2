5|$|Hitler {{lived with}} his half-niece, Geli Raubal, in an {{apartment}} at Prinzregentenplatz 16 in Munich from 1929 until her death.

40|$|SummaryIn {{patients}} with {{moderate to severe}} high-frequency hearing loss, cochlear damage may include “dead regions” {{where there are no}} functional inner hair cells and/or associated neurons. Aim: This study examines speech recognition in sensorineural impaired hearing {{patients with}} and without cochlear dead regions at high frequencies. Methods: a clinical and experimental study was made of thirty patients with sensorineural hearing loss that were classified into two groups: group 1 - included 15 subjects with hearing loss and no dead regions; and group 2 - included 15 subjects with <b>dead</b> regions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cochlea at high frequencies. Patients undertook word recognition score and speech reception threshold tests, with and without background noise. The speech tests were done with and without hearing aids in two situations: program 1 - broadband amplification (bandwidth 8000 Hz); and program 2 - amplification up to 2560 Hz, without high frequency gain. Results: For subjects with no <b>dead</b> regions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cochlea (group 1) performance improved with program 1. For subjects with <b>dead</b> regions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cochlea (group 2) performance improved with program 2. Conclusions: Subjects with no <b>dead</b> regions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cochlea benefited from high-frequency information. Subjects with <b>dead</b> regions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cochlea benefited from reduced gain at high frequencies...|$|R

5|$|Sadler {{believed}} that mediums were {{a source of}} false comfort and, after World WarI ended, fought against the increased popularity of communication with the <b>dead.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1910s and 1920s, attempting to expose purported clairvoyants became one of Sadler's favorite pastimes and he regularly worked with a Northwestern University psychologist and Howard Thurston, then a prominent magician, while investigating psychics.

5|$|The {{courtyard}} {{house is}} {{the most common type of}} home portrayed in Han artwork. Ceramic architectural models of buildings, like houses and towers, were found in Han tombs, perhaps to provide lodging for the <b>dead</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afterlife.

The artistic designs found on ceramic roof tiles of tower models are in some cases exact matches to Han roof tiles found at archaeological sites.|$|E
5|$|A mysterious {{recruiter}} approaches Wilson, {{offering an}} experimental cure for his cancer. He {{is taken to}} Ajax and Angel Dust, who inject him with a serum designed to awaken latent mutant genes. They then subject him to days of torture to induce stress to trigger any mutation Wade may have, but without success. Wilson discovers Ajax's real name, Francis, and mocks him for it. In response, Ajax leaves Wilson in a hyperbaric chamber that takes him to the verge of asphyxiation periodically over a weekend. It finally activates a superhuman healing ability that cures his cancer, but leaves him severely disfigured with burn-like scars over his entire body. He escapes from the chamber and attacks Ajax, but relents when told that his disfigurement can be cured. Ajax subdues Wilson and leaves him for <b>dead</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> burning laboratory.|$|E

5|$|Aaron Ward and Sterett, {{independently}} {{searching for}} targets, both sighted Yūdachi, who appeared {{unaware of the}} approach of the two U.S. destroyers. Both U.S.ships hit Yūdachi simultaneously with gunfire and torpedoes, heavily damaging the destroyer and forcing her crew to abandon ship. The ship did not sink right away, however. Continuing on her way, Sterett was suddenly ambushed by Teruzuki, heavily damaged, and forced to withdraw from the battle area to the east. Aaron Ward wound up in a one-on-one duel with Kirishima, which the destroyer lost with heavy damage. She also tried to retire from the battle area to the east but soon stopped <b>dead</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water because the engines were damaged.|$|E
5|$|After {{his release}} on bond, Jernigan {{returned}} to {{the room at the}} Continental Inn in Lexington where he had been living prior to his arrest. On July 18, 1984, Jernigan's son Randy found him <b>dead</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> room. An autopsy showed that Jernigan suffered from coronary atherosclerosis, and heart disease was officially listed as the cause of death. Lexington police determined that there was no evidence to suggest foul play. Jernigan's ex-wife continued to pursue Jernigan's case against Wilkinson, but a Fayette County Circuit Court Judge awarded Wilkinson a summary judgment to dismiss the case in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Around the {{painting}} lie corpses {{in various states}} of undress.

The heaped bodies in The Destroying Angel were probably directly inspired by the events Etty had witnessed in France, and perhaps also by the cholera epidemic which killed thousands in London in 1832.|$|E
