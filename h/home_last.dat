2500|$|Another home loss on September 8, {{gave the}} Cardinals 38 at home, most since their {{franchise}} 2007 season record. They had 30 wins for a [...] winning percentage, with 13 remaining home games. The 12-5 {{loss to the}} lowly Milwaukee Brewers dropped {{them out of the}} second Wild Card spot. A club that never had a dozen runs scored off it at <b>home</b> <b>last</b> year has now had it happen three times in 2016. Still seeking their first home series win since July, the Cardinals fell to 2-8 in the first game of a homestand with this loss. The last team to advance to postseason play with a losing home record was the 2001 Atlanta Braves.|$|E
2500|$|Marcus Miller {{produced}} the original {{score for the}} film, while Antonio [...] "L. A." [...] Reid and Kenneth [...] "Babyface" [...] Edmonds worked on the soundtrack. With such a wealth of new material, director Hudlin said, [...] "sometimes we used score, sometimes we'd use a song by L.A. and Face, or sometimes Marcus would {{take some of the}} songs they had written and do score interpolations of it. For example, one of the songs, [...] "Love Shoulda Brought You Home", is a great example. That came from a line of dialogue where Halle is furious with Eddie, says 'love should've brought your ass <b>home</b> <b>last</b> night,' slaps him. At that time, L.A. leans over to me and goes 'that's a great song title.' I said, 'great idea.' They write a song, [...] "Love Shoulda Brought You Home". I said, 'well, who we going to get to sing it?' And they said 'well you know, we've got this great young singer who sang the demo, Reggie. If you like the demo then we can use her.' And I said 'great, let's use her.' So that was Toni Braxton's debut. And I remember when I finally met Toni at Babyface's wedding, L.A. said, 'you owe your career to this guy, he gave you your big break,' which was really sweet." ...|$|E
