An often-overlooked message {{is that we should}} discount costs but also take into account the increase in the relative price of the ecosystem service endangered. The <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>discounting</b> would thus be counteracted, and if the rate of price rise of the item was fast enough, it might even be reversed. The scarcity that leads to rising relative prices for the environmental good will also have direct effects on the discount rate itself. The magnitude of these effects depends on properties of the economy’s technology and on social preferences. We develop a simple model of the economy that illustrates how changes in crucial technology and preference parameters may affect both the discount rate and the rate of change of values of environmental goods. The combined <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>discounting</b> and the change of values of environmental goods {{is more likely to be}} low – or even negative – the lower the growth rate of environmental quality (or the larger its decline rate), and the lower the elasticity of substitution between environmental quality and produced goods. ...|$|E

30|$|A unique {{finding of}} this study was that the direct <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> price <b>discounts</b> on affect was {{stronger}} than that on perceived savings or on perceived quality. A comparison of the three types <b>of</b> price promotion <b>effects</b> identified by Raghubir et al. (2004) indicated that the affective <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> price <b>discounts</b> (i.e., the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> price <b>discounts</b> on affect) is stronger than economic effect (i.e., the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> price <b>discounts</b> on perceived savings) or informational effect (i.e., the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> price <b>discounts</b> on perceived quality), particularly {{in the context of an}} online apparel product. Consumers perceived high hedonic value not only in the apparel products themselves (Kim and Forsythe 2007; Kim and Hong 2011), but also in the price discount they received. In addition, due to the limited information on online shopping, consumers rely more on affective reaction than on cognitive evaluations in the formation of their perceptions (Zeithaml 1988). These results indicate that price discounts play an important role in creating an affective shopping experience for online apparel shoppers.|$|R

This criterion, called the mixed Bentham-Rawls criterion, moderates the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>discounting,</b> yet permits some degree of intertemporal trade-off. It is a weighted average of two terms: (a) the sum of discounted utilities and (b) the utility level of the least advantaged generation. We derive necessary conditions to characterize growth paths that satisfy our criterion, and show that in some models with familiar dynamic specifications, an optimal path exists and displays appealing characteristics.

40|$|The present article {{discusses}} {{the economic and}} legal <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> single-product loyalty <b>discounts.</b> It is clear that arguments concerning the “pro-competitive” <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> such <b>discounts</b> must be judged with skepticism. This applies in particular to the assumed <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> loyalty <b>discounts</b> resulting from double profit surcharges or falling average costs, {{as well as in}} the context of price discrimination. I argue that many <b>of</b> the alleged <b>effects</b> could also be achieved with discount forms where the risk <b>of</b> restrictive <b>effects</b> on competition should be lower. Also, the assumed anti-competitive <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> loyalty <b>discounts</b> must be better justified economically. This article suggests using a form-based approach for the assessment <b>of</b> <b>discount</b> schemes. However, this should not amount to a restrictive assessment <b>of</b> certain <b>discount</b> schemes. For the development of such a form-based approach, it is necessary to review the theories about pro-competitive and anti-competitive effects. Therefore, this article attempts to identify which positive effects are more likely to be achieved by means <b>of</b> which <b>discount</b> forms and under which circumstances...|$|R
30|$|The most {{intriguing}} result {{in this study}} was that the direct and indirect influences <b>of</b> price <b>discounts</b> on perceived apparel quality were both significant, but opposite in direction, resulting in an insignificant total <b>effect.</b> The results <b>of</b> the negative direct <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> price <b>discounts</b> on perceived quality may explain why some previous researchers have found a negative <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> price <b>discounts</b> on perceived quality (Garretson and Clow 1999), while the results of the positive indirect <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> price <b>discounts</b> on perceived quality may explain why some other researchers have found a positive effect (Huang et al. 2014; Rungtrakulchai 2013). In addition, the total <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> price <b>discounts</b> on perceived quality was not significant in this study because the opposite direct and indirect effects cancelled each other out. The phenomenon that direct and indirect effects are in opposite directions is referred to as competitive mediation (Shrout and Bolger 2002). These results may explain why a previous study (Grewal et al. 1998 a) found that price discounts had no significant influence on perceived quality.|$|R

Since discount rates are unobservable, we use smoking behavior as a proxy to study the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>discounting</b> on wage dynamics. We find that smokers, compared to non-smokers, earn lower wages at the time they enter the labor market and experience substantially lower rates of wage growth. These differences are consistent with the discounting hypothesis, and highly robust to an extensive array of control variables. ...|$|E
30|$|The current {{analysis}} was conducted using a medium-term perspective and thus did not include estimates of fixed costs (administration, lighting, depreciation of buildings and equipment etc.) or capital costs associated with setting up the day surgery facilities. Inclusion of fixed costs {{would be unlikely to}} alter the conclusion that day surgery can be conducted more cheaply than can inpatient surgery but would likely increase the cost savings of day surgery. The effects of adding capital costs would depend on the structure and organisation of the facilities provided. As the operations resulted in similar medium-term patient outcomes and would be unlikely to produce significant differences in long-term patient resource use, the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>discounting</b> the costs would also be negligible.|$|E

If there is a complex relationship between economic activities and environmental effects, the use of indirect economic measures such as environmental taxes may be inefficient compared with direct abatement measures. Moreover, an optimal tax can not be assessed if the level of abatement efforts is sub-optimal. This calls for an integrated approach {{to the analysis of}} environmental policy, including cost-benefit analysis of abatement measures. It is shown that cost-benefit evaluations of abatement should include a shadow price on environmental qualities that is likely to increase over time. The effect of this increase may outweigh the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>discounting,</b> thus making environmental benefits of present abatement measures in the far future count even with a high discount rate...|$|E

An optimal steady state is described, {{and the effects of}} parameter changes is discussed, in particular the discount rate. The <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>discounting</b> on the optimal stock size is demonstrated to be ambiguous.

40|$|The {{traditional}} textbook {{method of}} calculating a corporation’s {{cost of debt}} capital tends to minimize the practical process used to arrive at that cost. This is particularly true if the corporation has issued a coupon bond at either premium or discount. The theoretical before-tax cost of debt is easily calculated and does include the amortization <b>of</b> the <b>discount</b> or premium, but {{the significance of this}} amortization is not apparent. Further undermining the cost-of-capital process, finance and accounting students are taught that the dollar amount of coupon interest is tax-deductible to the corporation while tending to ignore the tax <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> amortizing the <b>discount</b> or premium or the amortization of other expenses associated with the original issuance of the bond.

40|$|To study intertemporal choices, {{researchers}} typically instruct {{subjects to}} choose between smaller and sooner (SS) and larger and later (LL) rewards (e. g., gaining CNY 210 in a week vs. gaining CNY 250 in five weeks). People generally tend to discount steeply and prefer SS to LL rewards in such situations. Jiang, Hu and Zhu (2014) recently showed that adding upfront losses or gains to both SS and LL rewards can reduce people’s discounting, and they provided several possible accounts for this effect, including the salience account and the time scale hypothesis. In the current paper, based on the upfront money effect found in Jiang et al. (2014), we further showed that the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>discounting</b> decreasing could be extended to adding dated-money between SS and LL rewards and after LL rewards. The results helped us exclude both the time scale hypothesis and another possible explanation: preference for improvement.

40|$|Objective: There {{are many}} {{medicines}} {{listed on the}} Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) in which point of sale price {{is less than the}} level of the general patient co-payment. In these circumstances, the patient covers the total cost of the medicine from their own pocket with no government subsidy. The aim {{of the present study was}} to compare the consumer prices of under general co-payment prescription medicines between banner group pharmacies with open discounting policies and community pharmacies without; and to assess the impact of the April 2012 PBS price disclosure policies on the discounts offered. Methods: The consumer prices of 31 under co-payment medicines were collected from banner group pharmacy websites and individual pharmacies both before and after April 2012. PBS maximum prices were obtained from the PBS website. Absolute and relative price differences between PBS and pharmacy groups were calculated. Results: Before April 2012, banner group pharmacies provided discounts to patients of around 40 % per prescription, whereas other pharmacies provided discounts of around 15 %. Total price savings were on average $ 9 per prescription at banner group pharmacies and $ 3. 50 at other pharmacies. Percentage discounts did not change greatly after April 2012, when price decreases occurred on the PBS. Conclusions: Banner group pharmacies with pricing strategies are able to provide greater discounts to patients compared with other pharmacies. Community pharmacies still have the ability to provide substantial discounts after the April 2012 price reductions. What is known about the topic?: There is currently little known about the under co-payment medicines market in Australia and the price discounts available to patients. What does this paper add? This research shows that patients who purchase under co-payment medicines are able to save money if they purchase from pharmacies with openly advertised discounting policies. Price reductions related to the implementation of the price disclosure policy had a small effect on the discounts offered by community pharmacies to patients. What are the impacts for practitioners? The <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>discounting</b> on under co-payment medicines to patients may increase their ability to afford essential medicines. Questions remain on whether the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>discounting</b> on under co-payment medicines may affect the quality of professional services provided to patients by pharmacists. Loc P.

40|$|By {{estimating}} {{that the}} cost of unmitigated climate damages is an order of magnitude higher than most earlier estimates, the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change has had a major influence on the policy discussion on climate change. Not surprisingly, severe criticism has been levied against the report, especially by those who claim that the Stern Review's results hinge mainly on a discount rate that is too low. While we have no strong objections to the discounting assumptions adopted in the Stern Review, our main point in this article is that the conclusions reached in the Stern Review can be justified without using a low discount rate. We argue that nonmarket damages from climate change are probably underestimated and that future scarcities caused by the changing composition of the economy and climate change should lead to rising relative prices for certain goods and services. This will raise the estimated damage of climate change and modify as well as counteract the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>discounting.</b> We illustrate this effect using a slightly modified version of Nordhaus's DICE model and show that taking relative prices into account can have as large an effect on economically warranted abatement levels as a low discount rate...|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to a strong direct relationship between price discounts and price discount affect, the results also showed a significant mediating <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> price <b>discount</b> affect {{on the relationship between}} price discounts and perceived quality. When the direct <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> price <b>discounts</b> on perceived quality was examined, the results showed a negative relationship; i.e., consumers perceived that highly <b>discounted</b> products were <b>of</b> low quality. However, when price discount affect served as a mediator, the indirect relationship between price discounts and perceived quality became positive; i.e., the affect created by a price discount led to a positive perception of product quality. According to Lee and Tsai (2014), when consumers use their emotions rather than cognition to evaluate products or make purchase decisions, they pay less attention to the details and nuance, but focus instead on their affective experience, probably because affect can change the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> price <b>discounts</b> on perceived quality from negative to positive. These results support the affect-cognition model in that the affect triggered by a particular stimulus influences consumers’ cognitive responses.|$|R

40|$|Can markets assist by {{providing}} support for ecological restoration, and if so, under what conditions? The {{first step in}} addressing this question {{is to develop a}} consistent methodology for economic evaluation of ecological restoration projects. A risk analysis process was followed in which a system dynamics model was constructed for eight diverse case study sites where ecological restoration is currently being pursued. Restoration costs vary across each of these sites, as do the benefits associated with restored ecosystem functioning. The system dynamics model simulates the ecological, hydrological and economic benefits of ecological restoration and informs a portfolio mapping exercise where payoffs are matched against the likelihood of success of a project, {{as well as a number}} of other factors (such as project costs and risk measures). This is the first known application that couples ecological restoration with system dynamics and portfolio mapping. The results suggest an approach that is able to move beyond traditional indicators of project success, since the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>discounting</b> is virtually eliminated.

In this paper several empirical studies which highlight water pricing theories and related models have been reviewed. These theories explain different aspect of water pricing {{that can be used}} as a means to improve water use efficiency. Analysis of partial equilibrium can be viewed as effects of a policy on a specific sector like agriculture, but an analysis of general equilibrium often involves steady-state paths which is in fact a macro-level approach. A comparison of first best pricing with second best pricing models shows that the latter are possible when transaction costs are included. In the absence of storage capacities limits and direct costs of water, development decision studies find that the price of water held in storage must rise at the rate of interest and that the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>discounting</b> is to cause a cycle in the water price.
