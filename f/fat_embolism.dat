25|$|An {{embolism}} is the lodging of an embolus, a blockage-causing {{piece of}} material, inside a blood vessel. The embolus {{may be a}} blood clot (thrombus), a fat globule (<b>fat</b> <b>embolism),</b> a bubble of air or other gas (gas embolism), or foreign material. An embolism can cause partial or total blockage of blood flow in the affected vessel. Such a blockage (a vascular occlusion) may affect {{a part of the}} body distant from where the embolus originated. An embolism in which the embolus is a piece of thrombus is called a thromboembolism. Thrombosis, the process of thrombus formation, often leads to thromboembolism.|$|E
25|$|In normal bone, {{fractures}} {{occur when}} there is significant force applied, or repetitive trauma over a long time. Fractures can also occur when a bone is weakened, such as with osteoporosis, or {{when there is}} a structural problem, such as when the bone remodels excessively (such as Paget's disease) or is the site of the growth of cancer. Common fractures include wrist fractures and hip fractures, associated with osteoporosis, vertebral fractures associated with high-energy trauma and cancer, and fractures of long-bones. Not all fractures are painful. When serious, depending on the fractures type and location, complications may include flail chest, compartment syndromes or <b>fat</b> <b>embolism.</b>|$|E

50|$|From {{the late}} 19th century, human fat was {{produced}} and offered under the trade name Humanol as a sterile, liquified preparation for injections in Germany. In 1909 {{it was introduced}} for surgical treatment of scars, wound disinfection, and wound revisions. In the 1920s it became out of fashion after low cure rates and the incidence of <b>fat</b> <b>embolisms</b> caused by its application.Dr. Rudolf Spanner, director of the Danzig Anatomical Institute set up a process to produce soap from human fat in 1943-44 and a limited quantity of the soap was produced on his order to clean autopsy rooms.Suggested sources for the fat include Stutthof concentration camp, Danzig Municipal Jail, and a Danzig psychiatric hospital.Until the 1960s various manufacturers offered alleged wrinkle creams for external use (Hormocenta of Hormocenta Cosmetic Böttger GmbH, or Placentubex C of Merz Pharmaceuticals) containing human fat from placentas collected from midwives and obstetric departments for industrial purposes. The use of human placentas was terminated in favour of animal products. In Peru a group of gangsters called pishtacos was accused of having manufactured and marketed human fat, the case turned out as a free invention of the investigators.|$|R

30|$|This {{retrospective}} study presents the experience gained {{through use of}} reamed femoral nails and reports results and respective complications. This study included 415 femur fractures (312 men and 101 women {{with a mean age}} of 27.8  years) that were treated from 1993 to 2004. The fractures were classified according to AO, and 74 open fractures were included and typed according to the Gustilo classification. Dynamic nailing was performed for nearly all type A fractures and static nailing for types B and C. After a mean follow-up of 1.5  years, union rate was 97.8 %. The complications were: 9 non-unions, 14 delayed-unions, 4 torsional malunions, 6 limb length discrepancies (shortening) and 30 nerve pareses due to traction. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) occurred below the knee in 4 patients, while there were recorded 3 pulmonary and 2 <b>fat</b> <b>embolisms,</b> 1 superficial and 1 deep infection. There were 28 broken screws identified postoperatively. Logistic regression analysis revealed that type B and C were associated with increased risk of complications, with respective odds ratios of 3.1 (95 % CI =  1.3 – 7.2, P =  0.011) and 4.3 (95 % CI =  1.8 – 10.3, P =  0.001) when compared to type A patterns. All patients returned to their activities in a mean time of 10  months. Intramedullary nailing is still the treatment of choice for femoral shaft fractures, but knowledge of potential complications and their association with certain fracture patterns is needed.|$|R
40|$|In 1972 {{an article}} in the Lancet {{described}} an accidental infusion of a “Milk Drip ” meant to be infused intragastrically but was “inadvertently ” infused intravenously (Wallace, Payne et al. 1972). The patient had immediate severe consequences of this intravenous infusion of a feeding. Over the following 30 plus years there have been numerous case reports of accidental connections of feeding lines to intravenous lines, intravenous lines and feeding lines to tracheostomy cuffs, blood pressure monitors to intravenous lines and other life threatening connections of compatible tubing to the wrong line (Lanigan 2002; FDA 2003; Eakle, Gallauresi et al. 2005). To date there has been no progress in eradicating this avoidable error. The common element in each of these tragic errors is the presence of a “luer lock ” connector that Debora Simmons, MSN, RN makes connecting therapeutic products easy but also allows fatal errors when they are mistakenly connected. Blood pressure cuffs to intravenous lines can cause air embolisms, feeding tubes to intravenous lines cause sepsis and <b>fat</b> <b>embolisms</b> and intrathecal infusions of vincristine are fatal. The commonality is that each one of these errors involves a luer lock connector (FDA 2003). Initial reactions to these case reports may be to question the vigilance of the nurse. How could a careful nurse accidentally connect the wrong lines? The answer is complex and includes many different factors that contribute to making this type of error. ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Fat</b> <b>embolism</b> usually {{occurs when}} {{endogenous}} (from sources within the organism) fat tissue escapes {{into the blood}} circulation.

40|$|Objective: Clinical {{application}} of autologous fat grafting (AFG) is quickly expanding. Despite the widely acceptance, long-term survival rate (SR) of AFG remains a question not yet solved. Meanwhile, although rare, severe complications related to AFG including vision loss, stroke even death {{could be seen}} in the literature. Data Sources: A comprehensive research of PubMed database to June 2013 was performed according to guidelines of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons Fat Graft Task Force Assessment Methodology. Articles were screened using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Study Selection: Data collected included patient characteristics, surgical technique, donor site, recipient site, graft amount, and quantified measurement methods. Patient cohorts were pooled, and SR was calculated. All the severe complications were also summarized according to the different clinical characteristics. Results: Of 550 articles, 16 clinical articles and 10 animal studies met the inclusion criteria and provided quantified measurement methods. Totally, 596 patients were included. SR varied from 34 % to 82 % in breast and 30 - 83 % in the facial area. Nude mice were applied to investigate human fat grafting SR (38. 3 - 52. 5 % after 15 weeks). Rabbits were commonly used to study animal AFG SR (14. 00 - 14. 56 % after 1 -year). Totally, 21 severe complications were reported, including death (2), stroke (10), vision loss (11, 8 of which accompanied with stroke), sepsis (3), multiple abscess (1) and giant fat necrotic cyst (2). Ten of these complications happened within 10 years. Conclusions: There is no unified measurement method to evaluate fat graft SR until now and no clinical evidence to show better SR according to different donor and recipient cite. Body mass index change between pre- and postoperation may be the bias factor in evaluating <b>fat</b> SR. <b>Fat</b> <b>embolisms</b> of the ophthalmic artery and the middle cerebral artery are the most severe complication of AFG and still lack of effective treatment...|$|R

40|$|Background: Clinical and {{experimental}} {{studies have suggested}} that the maximum risk of thrombogenesis oc-curs during, rather than after, total hip arthroplasty. With use of conventional cementing techniques, insertion of a femoral component results in marrow embolization of tissue thromboplastin into the veins of the proximal part of the femur, leading to activation of the clotting cascade and thrombogenesis. We hypothesized that an operative technique designed for the prevention of <b>fat</b> and bone-marrow <b>embolism</b> can also reduce the inci-dence of postoperative deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Methods: A total of 130 consecutive patients with osteoarthritis who were to have a primary total hip arthro-plasty were {{randomly assigned to one of}} two groups. One group consisted of sixty-five patients (sixty-five hips) who had the femoral component inserted with our standard cementing technique without use of a bone vac-uum, and the other group included sixty-five patients (sixty-five hips) who had the femoral component cemented with use of a bone-vacuum technique. In the hips managed with the bone vacuum, suction (– 800 mbar) was ap-plied to a drainage cannula placed along the linea aspera of the femur in order to prevent an increase in in-tramedullary pressure during the insertion of the stem. We measured the incidence of intraoperative <b>fat</b> and bone-marrow <b>embolism</b> with use of echocardiography and a transesophageal probe and the incidence of deep-vein thrombosis with use of serial duplex ultrasonography on the day before the operation and on postoperativ...|$|R
