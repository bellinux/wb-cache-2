40|$|<b>Hammadah</b> al Hamra 126 (HAH 126) {{is a new}} ureilite {{recovered}} from the Sahara desert in 1995. This meteorite experienced fairly extensive weathering in the desert environment. Olivines in HAH 126 are more intensely reduced than those in other ureilites which have been studied to date. We have obtained a cooling rate of 0. 1 - 0. 7 ℃/hour for the reduction rims of olivines using diffusion calculations. This cooling rate is slightly slower than those for other ureilites. Rims of pigeonite grains in HAH 126 often show high-Ca contents. These Ca-rich materials resemble those which are present at olivine rims in Y- 74123 ureilite. This fact suggests that Ca-rich melt was present at grain boundaries (H. OGATa et al.; Meteoritics, 25, 195, 1991) ...|$|E

40|$|The CB chondrites are metal-rich chondritic meteorites having {{characteristics}} that sharply distinguish them from other chondrites [1], including (1) high metal abundances (60 - 80 vol. % metal), (2) most chondrules have cryptocrystalline or barred textures, (3) moderately volatile lithophile elements are highly depleted and (4) nitrogen is enriched {{in the heavy}} isotope. Similarities in mineral composition, as well as oxygen and nitrogen isotopic compositions of the CB to CR and CH chondrites are consistent with derivation of these chondrite groups from a common nebular reservoir, hence their grouping in the CR clan [1, 2, 3, 4].

40|$|<b>Hammadah</b> al Hamra 286 (HaH 286) {{is one of}} the Saharan meteorites {{found in}} Lybia in 2000. The me-teorite was {{classified}} as an eucrite in 2001 (Grossman & Zipfel, 2001).

40|$|The iodine-xenon {{system has}} been {{analyzed}} in samples of 7 chondrules from the CB chondrites Gujba and <b>Hammadah</b> al Hamra (HaH) 237. One sample from Gujba defined a high temperature iodine-xenon isochron corresponding to closure 1. 87 ± 0. 4 Ma before closure of Shallowater enstatite. Motivated by this result, we employ outlier rejection to re-evaluate the Shallowater age, leading to a modified value of 4562. 3 ± 0. 4 Ma (1 s̀). In this process, the datum obtained by combining our I-Xe age for Gujba with the literature Pb-Pb age is rejected as an outlier, indicating that in this sample the I-Xe system closed earlier than the accepted Pb-Pb age of chondrules from CB chondrites.

40|$|CB (Bencubbin-type) {{carbonaceous}} chondrites {{differ in}} many ways from more familiar CV and CO carbonaceous chondrites and from ordinary chondrites. CB chondrites are very rich in Fe-Ni metal (50 - 70 vol%) and contain magnesian silicates mainly as angular to sub-rounded clasts (or chondrules) with barred olivine (BO) or cryptocrystalline (CC) textures. Both metal and silicates appear to have formed by condensation. The sizes of silicate clasts vary greatly between the two subgroups of CB chondrites: large (up to one cm) in CB(sub a) chondrites, and typically to much much less than 1 mm in CB(sub b) chondrites. The compositional and mineralogical differences between these subgroups and between the CB(sub s) {{and other types of}} chondrites suggest different environment and possibly different timing of chondrule formation. In order to constrain the timing of chondrule forming processes in CB(sub s) and understand genetic relationship between their subgroups, we have determined Pb-isotopic ages of silicate material from the CB(sub a) chondrite Gujba and CB(sub b) chondrite <b>Hammadah</b> al Hamra 237 (HH 237 hereafter) ...|$|E

40|$|Aims: Embolisation of atheromatous debris during {{catheter}} manipulation {{is considered}} to underlie acute cerebrovascular events (CVE) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). However, the relationship between aorta atheroma burden and acute CVE after TAVI has not been established. We investigated the impact of aorta atheroma burden on acute CVE. Methods and Results: Preoperative multislice computed tomographic (MSCT) images in 278 patients receiving TAVI were analysed. Total atheroma volume (TAV) was calculated by measuring aorta vessel and lumen areas in every 1 mm cross-sectional image. Acute CVE was observed in 16 patients. Patients having acute CVE {{were more likely to}} have a prior CVE (p= 0. 002), and to exhibit greater TAV in the ascending aorta (12. 8 ± 3. 5 vs. 7. 0 ± 2. 1 cm 3, p 10. 3 cm 3 and in the aortic arch > 2. 9 cm 3 predicted acute CVE. The incidence of acute CVE was highest (36. 4 %) if patients had a prior CVE and TAV in the ascending aorta and the aortic arch above cut-offs. Conclusions: Patients with acute CVE after TAVI had greater aorta atheroma burden. Our findings might underscore preoperative MSCT analysis of aorta atherosclerosis to identify high-risk patients for acute CVE, who might require an embolic protection device during TAVI.

40|$|Gujba is a {{coarse-grained}} meteorite fall {{composed of}} 41 vol% large kamacite globules, 20 vol% large light-colored silicate globules with cryptocrystalline, barred pyroxene and barred olivine textures, 39 vol% dark-colored, silicate-rich matrix, and rare refractory inclusions. Gujba resembles Bencubbin and Weatherford in texture, oxygen-isotopic composition and in having high bulk delta N- 15 values (approximately + 685 % 0). The He- 3 cosmic-ray exposure age of Gujba (26 +/- 7 Ma) is essentially {{identical to that}} of Bencubbin, suggesting that they were both reduced to meter-size fragments in the same parent-body collision. The Gujba metal globules exhibit metal-troilite quench textures and vary in their abundances of troilite and volatile siderophile elements. We suggest that the metal globules formed as liquid droplets either via condensation in an impact-generated vapor plume or by evaporation of preexisting metal particles in a plume. The lower the abundance of volatile elements in the metal globules, the higher the globule quench temperature. We infer that the large silicate globules also formed from completely molten droplets; their low volatile-element abundances indicate that they also formed at high temperatures, probably by processes analogous to those that formed the metal globules. The coarse-grained Bencubbin-Weatherford-Gujba meteorites may represent a depositional component from the vapor cloud enriched in coarse and dense particles. A second class of Bencubbin-like meteorites (represented by <b>Hammadah</b> a 1 Hamra 237 and QUE 94411) may be a finer fraction derived from the same vapor clou...|$|E

40|$|Obesity is {{associated}} with adverse atherosclerotic cardiovascular events. While various metabolic abnormalities associated with obesity promote plaque formation, the morphological phenotype of atherosclerotic plaque has not been well characterized {{in the setting of}} obesity. Frequency-domain optical coherence tomography (FD-OCT) enables in vivo visualization of plaque microstructures associated with vulnerability. We characterized plaque microstructures in obese patients. FD-OCT imaging was performed in 308 patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients were stratified according to {{the presence or absence of}} obesity (body mass index[*]>[*] 30 [*]kg/m(2)). Plaques in obese (n[*]=[*] 129) and non-obese (n[*]=[*] 179) patients were compared with regard to clinical characteristics and FD-OCT-derived features of plaque vulnerability. Obese patients were more likely to be younger (p[*]=[*] 0. 01), female (p[*]=[*] 0. 01) and have a history of hypertension (p[*]=[*] 0. 01). Higher levels of triglyceride (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001) and glucose (p[*]=[*] 0. 02), whereas a lower level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (p[*]=[*] 0. 02) was observed in obese patients. FD-OCT imaging demonstrated thinner fibrous caps (85. 3 [*]±[*] 31. 1 vs 110. 1 [*]±[*] 32. 4 [*]µm, p[*]=[*] 0. 01) and a higher prevalence of thin-cap fibroatheroma (28. 8 vs 14. 3 %, p[*]=[*] 0. 01) in obese patients, which remained significant after controlling for differences in clinical characteristics. Achieving a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level[*]<[*] 1. 8 [*]mmol/l was associated with thicker fibrous caps in obese patients, but only to the level observed in non-obese patients with suboptimal lipid control. Obese patients harbor more vulnerable plaques in association with atherogenic risk factors.

40|$|Background: Spotty {{calcification}} is a morphological {{characteristic of}} a vulnerable plaque phenotype. While this calcium pattern is considered an active process, promoted by inflammation, it is unknown whether spotty calcification associates with development of microstructures observed in vulnerable plaques. As frequency-domain optical coherence tomography (FD-OCT) enables visualization of microstructures associated with plaque vulnerability, we investigated the association between spotty calcification and plaque microstructures by using FD-OCT. Methods: A total of 300 patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD), having clinical indication for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), were analyzed. Totally 280 non-culprit lipid plaques within the target vessel requiring PCI were evaluated by FD-OCT. Spotty calcification {{was defined as a}} presence of lesion < 4 mm in length, containing an arc of calcification < 90 ° on FD-OCT. Plaque microstructures were compared in non-culprit lipid-rich plaques with and without spotty calcification. RESULTS: Spotty calcification was observed in 39. 6 % of non-culprit lipid-rich plaques, with 30. 6 % of these plaques demonstrating multiple spotty calcifications. Plaques containing spotty calcification exhibited a greater lipid index (= averaged lipid arc × lipid length); 1, 511. 8 ± 1, 522. 3 vs. 815. 2 ± 1, 040. 3 mm°, P< 0. 0001), thinner fibrous caps (89. 0 ± 31. 6 vs. 136. 5 ± 32. 5 µm, P= 0. 002) and a higher prevalence of microchannels (45. 9 % vs. 17. 7 %, P= 0. 007). A significant association was observed between the number of spotty calcifications per plaque and fibrous cap thickness (r=- 0. 40, P= 0. 006). Increased number of spotty calcification was also associated with a higher prevalence of microchannel within plaques (P= 0. 01). Conclusions: In patients with stable CAD requiring PCI, the presence of spotty calcification imaged by FD-OCT was associated with features of greater plaque vulnerability.

40|$|Aortic {{atherosclerosis}} {{has been}} linked with worse peri- and post-procedural outcomes following a range of aortic procedures. Yet, there are currently no standardized methods for non-invasive volumetric pan-aortic plaque assessment. We propose a novel means of more accurately assessing plaque volume across whole aortic segments using computed tomography angiography (CTA) imaging. Sixty patients who underwent CTA prior to trans-catheter aortic valve implantation were included in this analysis. Specialized software analysis (3 mensio Vascular™, Pie Medical, Maastricht, Netherlands) was used to reconstruct images using a centerline approach, thus creating true cross-sectional aortic images, akin to those images produced with intravascular ultrasonography. Following aortic segmentation (from the aortic valve to the renal artery origin), atheroma areas were measured across multiple contiguous evenly spaced (10 mm) cross-sections. Percent atheroma volume (PAV), total atheroma volume (TAV) and calcium score were calculated. In our populations (age 79. 9 ± 8. 5 years, male 52 %, diabetes 27 %, CAD 84 %, PVD 20 %), mean ± SD number of cross sections measured for each patient was 35. 1 ± 3. 5 sections. Mean aortic PAV and TAV were 33. 2 ± 2. 51 % and 83, 509 ± 17, 078 mm(3), respectively. Median (IQR) calcium score was 1. 5 (0. 7 - 2. 5). Mean (SD) inter-observer coefficient of variation and agreement for plaque area among 4 different analysts was 14. 1 (5. 4), and the mean (95 % CI) Lin's concordance correlation coefficient was 0. 79 (0. 62 - 0. 89), effectively simulating a Core Laboratory scenario. We provide an initial validation of cross-sectional volumetric aortic atheroma assessment using CTA.

40|$|The winonaites are {{primitive}} achondrites {{which are}} associated with the IAB iron meteorites. Textural evidence implies heating to at least the Fe, Ni-FeS cotectic, but previous geochemical studies are ambiguous about the extent of silicate melting in these samples. Oxygen isotope evidence indicates that the precursor material {{may be related to the}} carbonaceous chondrites. Here we analysed a suite of winonaites for modal mineralogy and bulk major- and trace-element chemistry in order to assess the extent of thermal processing as well as constrain the precursor composition of the winonaite -IAB parent asteroid. Modal mineralogy and geochemical data are presented for eight winonaites. Textural analysis reveals that, for our sub-set of samples, all except the most primitive winonaite (Northwest Africa 1463) reached the Fe, Ni-FeS cotectic. However, only one (Tierra Blanca) shows geochemical evidence for silicate melting processes. Tierra Blanca is interpreted as a residue of small-degree silicate melting. Our sample of Winona shows geochemical evidence for extensive terrestrial weathering. All other winonaites studied here (Fortuna, Queen Alexander Range 94535, <b>Hammadah</b> al Hamra 193, Pontlyfni and NWA 1463) have chondritic major-element ratios and flat CI-normalised bulk rare-earth element patterns, suggesting that most of the winonaites did not reach the silicate melting temperature. The majority of winonaites were therefore heated to a narrow temperature range of between ~ 1220 (the Fe, Ni-FeS cotectic temperature) and ~ 1370 K (the basaltic partial melting temperature). Silicate inclusions in the IAB irons demonstrate partial melting did occur in some parts of the parent body (Ruzicka and Hutson, 2010), thereby implying heterogeneous heat distribution within this asteroid. Together, this indicates that melting was the result of internal heating by short-lived radionuclides. The brecciated nature of the winonaites suggests that the parent body was later disrupted by a catastrophic impact, which allowed the preservation of the largely unmelted winonaites. Despite major-element similarities to both ordinary and enstatite chondrites, trace-element analysis suggests the winonaite parent body had a arbonaceous chondrite-like precursor composition. The parent body of the winonaites was volatile -depleted relative to CI, but enriched compared to the other carbonaceous classes. The closest match are the CM chondrites, however, the specific precursor is not sampled in current meteorite collections...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the metal-rich chondrites QUE 94411 (QUE), <b>Hammadah</b> al Hamra 237 (HH 237) and Bencubbin with an {{emphasis}} on the petrographical and mineralogical effects of the shock processing that these meteorite assemblages have undergone. Iron-nickel metal and chondrule silicates are the main components in these meteorites. These high-temperature components are held together by shock melts consisting of droplets of dendritically intergrown FeNi metal/sulfide embedded in ferrous silicate glass. The silicate glass component of the shock melt is substantially more FeO-rich (FeO: 30 to 40 wt%) than the prevailing chondrule silicates (FeO less than 5 wt%). Fine-grained matrix material, which is a major component in most other chondritic assemblages, is extremely scarce in QUE 4411 and HH 237; it has not been observed in Bencubbin. This material occurs as rare, hydrated, and fine-grained matrix lumps with major and minor element abundances roughly similar to the ferrous silicate shock melts (and CI). We infer that hydrated, fine-grained material, compositionally similar to these matrix lumps, was originally present between the FeNi metal grains and chondrules, but was preferentially heated by the shock wave and melted. Other shock-related features in QUE 94411, HH 237, and Bencubbin include a distinct alignment and occasionally strong plastic deformation of metal and chondrule fragments. However, the existence of chemically zoned and metastable FeNi metal condensates condensates in direct contact with shock melts indicates that the shock did not substantially increase the average temperature of the aggregate. TEM analyses of the FeNi metal droplets embedded in the shock melts show martensitic crystal structures, indicating rapid cooling, essentially quenching, of the shock melts. These findings indicate that the preshock temperature of the assemblage was low. Because porphyritic olivine-pyroxene chondrules are absent in QUE 94411, HH 237, and Bencubbin, {{it is difficult to determine}} the precise shock stage of these meteorites, but the shock was probably relatively light (S 2 - S 3; 5 - 20 GPa) consistent with a bulk temperature increase of the assemblages of less than 200 C. The higher pressures within this range (i. e. 15 - 20 GPa) are consistent with the findings of shock produced diamonds in Bencubbin. The many mineralogical, petrological and isotopic (e. g. O and N) similarities between Bencubbin, Weatherford, Gujba and QUE/HH 237 have been used to argue for a common origin of these meteorites on a single asteroidal parent body. The findings of this study, which indicate similar shock processing, lend support to this view...|$|E
