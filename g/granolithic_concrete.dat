It is generally used as flooring, or as paving (such as for sidewalks). It has a similar appearance to concrete, and is used to provide a durable surface where texture and appearance are usually not important (such as outdoor pathways or factory floors). It is commonly laid as a screed. Screeds are a type of flooring laid on top of the structural element (like reinforced concrete) to provide a level surface on which the [...] "wearing flooring" [...] (the flooring which people see and walk on) is laid. A screed can also be laid bare, as it provides a long-lasting surface.|$|E

The test model of inserted floor fragment represents three- layer structure based on bearing steel frame made of thin- sheet cold-bent zinc-coated C- like section profiles. The test have shown that the fire resistance of fragment of this inserted floor is 47 minutes, which corresponds to classification REI 45 according to GOST 30247. 0 - 94. Fire resistance of this floor is lower than steel-aggregate <b>granolithic</b> <b>concrete</b> slab based on profiled deck (REI 90) and lower than reinforced beamless floor (REI 150), however according to The Technical Regulations of Fire Safety Requirements and SNiP 21. 01 - 97 this inserted floor represents degree II-III of fire resistance, while buildings with degree III of fire resistance may have up to 5 floors with total area not more than 2000 m 2 according to SNiP 2. 08. 02 - 89 “Public buildings and constructions”. Also it is allowed to use this floor in dwelling single- family houses with height up to 3 floors (up to 150 m 2 each) in accord with SNiP 31 - 02 - 2001 “Dwelling single- family houses”...|$|E
