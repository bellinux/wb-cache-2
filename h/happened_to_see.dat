5|$|Mahendra {{was born}} in 1939 into a Sri Lankan Tamil family in the village Amirthakali near Batticaloa, Sri Lanka. Born to a {{professor}} father, he did his schooling at Methodist Central College and St. Michael's College, Batticaloa. As a teenager, he was drawn towards films by his class teacher. It was during this time he <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Bicycle Thieves (1948) and Battleship Potemkin (1925). When {{he was at the}} sixth grade, he got an opportunity to witness the making of David Lean's The Bridge on the River Kwai (shot in Sri Lanka) during a school field trip. Inspired by Lean's personality, Mahendra determined to become a film-maker.|$|E
25|$|Andersson's {{good fortune}} in {{stumbling}} across prospects continued in 2001 when he <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{a game in}} which Jonathan Ericsson, at the time a center, had been switched to defense temporarily due to injuries on his team. Ericsson had not garnered any attention from other scouts as a forward, but Andersson thought he was an excellent defender with great size and reach, and so recommended that Ericsson should move to defense permanently. The Wings subsequently drafted Ericsson with the last pick in the 2002 draft on Andersson's word of his potential as a defender, and is currently playing in the NHL with the Wings.|$|E

Producer Larry Rosen <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the broadcast and was impressed by her performance. Rosen and his business partner, musician Dave Grusin, {{set out to find}} Schuur by contacting Stan Getz. This led to a recording contract with GRP Records. Nancy Reagan invited Schuur to perform at the White House a second time, for a [...] "Ladies of the Senate" [...] luncheon in 1987, where she performed as a vocalist with the Count Basie Orchestra. She returned to the White House a third time to perform for President Clinton in 1995.|$|E

2500|$|Polyakov {{suddenly}} died of {{a stroke}} {{at the age of}} 50 during a funeral ceremony for Anton (Abram) Warshawsky (Warshawsky's son Leon was married to Polyakov's daughter). He was buried in a family vault at Saint Peterburg's Jewish Cemetery. Admiral Ivan Shestakov recalled that [...] "... apart from the Tsar's funeral, I never <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> such a mass of people as attended Polyakov's funeral". The cemetery still stands but Polyakov vault has been destroyed. The tomb of Samuel Polyakov by Mark Antokolski was salvaged and placed in the Russian Museum collection. Another statue of Polyakov by Antokolski is on display in the Museum of Arts in Saratov, one of the many institutions sponsored by Polyakov.|$|E
2500|$|In 1945, aged 62, Bardsley married 45-year-old Gertrude Cope, {{his wife}} {{until his death}} in 1954. [...] The last time they met, leaving the funeral of Dr. Rowley Pope, Jack Fingleton asked Bardsley his thoughts: [...] "I was just {{thinking}}," [...] said the old cricketer, [...] "what a great bloke old Doc was. [...] I was thinking of him, and then I just <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> So-And-So across there, and I thought, Poor old So-And-So. [...] By cripes, he's looking old.

2500|$|Capp also lampooned popular {{recording}} idols of the day, such as Elvis Presley ("Hawg McCall," [...] 1957), Liberace ("Loverboynik," [...] 1956), the Beatles ("the Beasties," [...] 1964)—and in 1944, Frank Sinatra. [...] "Sinatra was {{the first}} great public figure I ever wrote about," [...] Capp once said. [...] "I called him 'Hal Fascinatra.' I remember my news syndicate was so worried about what his reaction might be, {{and we were all}} surprised when he telephoned and told me how thrilled he was with it. He always {{made it a point to}} send me champagne whenever he <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> me in a restaurant..." [...] (from Frank Sinatra, My Father by Nancy Sinatra, 1985). On the other hand, Liberace was [...] "cut to the quick" [...] over Loverboynik, according to Capp, and even threatened legal action—as would Joan Baez later, over [...] "Joanie Phoanie" [...] in 1967.|$|E
2500|$|A week or {{two after}} graduating, she <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a US Civil Service ad in The Philadelphia Inquirer looking for women with degrees in mathematics. During World War II, the US Army was hiring women to {{calculate}} bullet and missile trajectories at Ballistic Research Laboratory, which had been established at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Aberdeen, Maryland, with staff from both the Aberdeen Proving Ground and the Moore School of Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania [...] She immediately called her two fellow math majors, Frances Bilas and Josephine Benson about the ad. Benson couldn't meet up with them, so Kathleen and Fran met in Philadelphia one morning in June 1942 for an interview in a building on South Broad Street (likely the Union League of Philadelphia Building). One week later, they were both hired as human [...] "computers" [...] at a pay grade of SP-4, a subprofessional civil service grade. The starting pay was $1620 annually. Kathleen stated the pay was [...] "very good at the time". They were notified to report {{to work at the}} Moore School of Engineering. Their job was to compute ballistics trajectories used for artillery firing tables, mostly using mechanical desk calculators and extremely large sheets of columned paper. The pay was low, but both Kathleen and Fran were satisfied to have attained employment that used their educations (having had no prior employment experience) and that served the war effort.|$|E
2500|$|He aroused much {{controversy}} by his {{series of three}} pictures: firstly, of a Roman execution (the Crucifixion by the Romans (1887)); secondly, [...] "Suppression of the Indian Revolt by the English" [...] depicting sepoys being blown from cannons; and, thirdly, of the execution of Nihilists in St Petersburg. His picture Suppression of the Indian Revolt by the English depicted executions carried out by tying victims to the barrels of guns. Vereshchagin's detractors argued that such executions had only occurred in the Indian Rebellion of 1857, but the painting depicted modern soldiers of the 1880s, implying that the practice was then current. Because of its photographic style, the painting appeared to present itself as an impartial record of a real event. In the Magazine of Art in December 1887, Vereshchagin defended himself by saying {{that if there were}} another rebellion then the British would use this method again.By the late 19th century, Vereshchagin had gained popularity, not only in Russia, but also abroad and his name never left the pages of the European and American press. From his earliest works, unlike most contemporary battle pieces depicting war as a kind of parade, Vereshchagin graphically depicted the horrors of war. [...] "I loved the sun all my life, and wanted to paint sunshine. When I <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> warfare and say what I thought about it, I rejoiced that I would be able to devote myself to the sun once again. But the fury of war continued to pursue me," [...] Vereshchagin wrote. One day, in 1882, Vereshchagin’s exhibition in Berlin was visited by German Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke the Elder. Vereshchagin brought Moltke to his painting The Apotheosis of War. The picture evoked a sort of confusion in the Field Marshal. After his visit to the exhibition, Moltke issued an order forbidding German soldiers to visit it. The Austrian war minister did the same. He also declined the artist's offer to let Austrian officers see his pictures free of charge at the 1881 exhibition in Vienna.|$|E

2500|$|In June 2009, Chakraverti {{collaborated with}} filmmaker Anjan Dutt and Sarika {{to make a}} film called The Loving Doll, with the story taken from Sacred Evil again. It will be filmed in Hindi with bits of English. Sarika plays the central {{character}} of a middle-aged woman obsessed about losing her looks. The story revolves around a married couple beset with personal problems, triggered by a doll owned by the wife. Charaverti said: [...] "After the film Sacred Evil, I have been approached by several directors for another film but the inspiration was not there. This time around there was a synchronicity— Sarika phoned me to ask if I was thinking of another film. She has long wanted to play the woman in The Loving Doll [...] Then I <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Madly Bangalee, and liked Anjan’s work very much. I think he has the touch {{to be able to handle}} the subject of The Loving Doll. So I contacted him and he was very interested in the project. Though he works in a very different genre from mine, I think there is empathy between his work and mine." [...] Chakraverti also said that she may play the part of a healer in the film, [...] "It’s the director’s prerogative. We will do what is best for the film." [...] In April 2010, ETV Bangla created a serial called Dibaratrir Galpo, which was based on Beloved Witch. The plot of Dibaratrir Galpo, directed by Tathagata Banerjee, centres around a dispute between two aristocratic Bengali families, but the lead character (played by Sudipta Chakraborty) was shown as a follower of Wicca who learns to develop her psychic power and uses it to counter the machinations of her enemies. Chakraverti appeared on the commercials for the serial because she felt that her deglamorised presence helped audiences in the suburbs see elderly women, who are often branded as witches, in a positive light. [...] "I felt that the story of Dibaratrir Galpo would take to esoteric ideas very well. It has a women-oriented theme and it will show how the negative aspects of the esoteric can be countered." ...|$|E
