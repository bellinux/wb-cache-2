There is currently debate about whether a 25 or 100 year decommissioning strategy should be adopted. After 80 years short-lifetime radioactive material in the defuelled core would have decayed to the point that human access to the reactor structure would be possible, easing dismantling work. A shorter decommissioning strategy would require a fully robotic core <b>dismantling</b> <b>technique.</b>|$|R
40|$|The failure {{criteria}} and the constitutive relation of materials for an early-age concrete {{are the most}} common reasons to conduct the nonlinear analysis and to assess the concrete structures during the construction stage. The delay of theoretical advancement in this field resulted into a mismatch between the rough theories and the advanced algorithms, which were adopted for the estimation and analysis of early-age concrete structures. It is often impossible to find an appropriate way to determine the {{failure criteria}} and its constitutive relation that may serve as a baseline. As a consequence, the development and the application of advanced techniques of construction, for example, early <b>dismantling</b> construction <b>technique</b> of formwork, have severely been restrained. Therefore, the study of the failure criteria and its constitutive relation of concrete materials at early-age are important. In this paper, the cubic compressive strength, the prismatic compressive strength, and the axial tensile strength are determined by carrying out a strength test on C 20 concrete material at an early-age. Next, the failure criteria of C 20 early-age concrete material in the octahedral stress space have been studied and analyzed by using the regression analysis and by deriving the mathematical relation...|$|R
40|$|Assessing the {{structural}} performance of existing concrete bridges is nowadays a major task. Nonlinear finite element (FE) analysis can quantify their capacity, evaluate strengthening interventions and prevent premature <b>dismantle.</b> However, this <b>technique,</b> mainly performed with 2 D/ 3 D FE, is seldom used at true scale {{due to the}} great complexity and computational costs involved. In this paper, the loading test of a strengthened concrete bridge in Sweden (Örnsköldsvik) is simulated using a 1 D model. The bridge failed in combination of shear–bending–torsion triggered by fibre-reinforced polymer bond failure. Consecutive levels of refinement of the 1 D model are presented and available results from higher order models are compared. The study of {{the structural}} response involved comparing displacements, strains, cracking patterns and failure mechanisms.

For this reason, new <b>dismantling</b> <b>techniques</b> with adequate blood supply to the bony fragments have been developed. Apart from the maxillo cheek flap, other composite flaps have been described. These flaps may be combined if necessary in selected cases.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the importance of}} building reconstruction {{and the need for}} improving the available formwork systems used for strengthening of structural elements during reconstruction. Citing the results of the analysis of the Russian and foreign scientific publications, the authors emphasize the necessity of replacing costly wooden formworks with high-technology reusable all-purpose and mobile formwork systems. Considering that such requirements are met by rubber-fabric formworks, the authors have developed a pneumatic formwork and showed by way of experiment that the labor intensity of installation and dismantling of such formworks is much lower as compared with conventional wooden formworks, which makes this research original. The paper further describes the design of the suggested formwork and the installation and <b>dismantling</b> <b>techniques.</b> The versatility of the formwork is confirmed by its ability to easily adapt to any structural elements (pier foundations, columns, beams etc.) ensured by the flexibility of rubber-fabric materials. This system can be used for structural elements having various geometric shapes (round, rectangle, trapezoidal) and dimensions. Their transportability is warranted not only by the dimensions and flexibility, but also by a small weight. The use of pneumatic formworks contributes to resolving the problem of conservation such valuable natural material as wood...|$|E
40|$|The European Gypsum Industry {{wishes to}} promote a {{circular}} economy mindset across Europe by creating a deconstruction culture. Gypsum products can be counted amongst the very few construction materials where “closed-loop” recycling is possible, i. e. where the waste is {{used to make the}} same product again. The European Gypsum Industry is conscious of those challenges which are embedded in the Waste Framework Directive 1 and wants to rationalize even more its efforts in conjunction with the relevant operators in the construction chain to recover construction and demolition waste. The European Gypsum Industry wants to enhance the access to natural resources by developing outstanding C&D waste management that will divert C&D waste from landfill applying the waste hierarchy (prevent-reuse-recycle-recover, dispose) in accordance with the life-cycle impact of gypsum products and systems (from extraction until the end-of-life). Applying <b>dismantling</b> <b>techniques</b> instead of demolishing the building will lead to sorting and recycling of non-load bearing elements for re-use in the production process. However, as the waste characterization differs, the production processes of the manufacturers must be adapted to increase the recycled content in the product. This needs research and development. Deconstruction is an essential step in waste recycling feasibility and should become mandatory if we want to obtain a circular economy. Deconstruction should also be applied in major renovation and light renovation of buildings. Internal partition in an office can be dismantled in case of refurbishment of that office, which is not the case currently. Education of the workforce is here essential to create a dismantling mentality when it is easy to be implemented...|$|E

The results will be presented in a web-based database where manuals, guides, national documents, references and literature studies are easily accessible. Case studies that exemplify the practical use of methods from the participating countries will also be available. The project is divided into four groups that concentrate on recycling {{of different types of}} road materials. They are: - unbound road materials, - hydraulically-bound road materials, - asphalt-based materials, - other materials (e. g. ash, slag, rubber tires, contaminated sediment and vegetation from ditches).

40|$|The {{dismantling}} of the BR 3 reactor produces quite large masses of contaminated materials, mainly metals or concrete. The main management routes are: conditioning of the radioactive wastes and disposal, recycling of radioactive materials in the nuclear sector and the recycling of cleared materials in the industrial sector or their evacuation as industrial waste. The paper {{is focused on the}} management of the dismantled contaminated metals. It gives an overview of the main management routes followed with their associated <b>dismantling</b> and decontamination <b>techniques.</b> The administrative and the technical aspects starting from the dismantling up to the final evacuation are dealt with. The radiochemical characterization is also important at all the steps of the dismantling process. Characterization is performed on site before dismantling to guarantee the workers safety and for the selection of the right evacuation route. Melting in a nuclear foundry either for clearance or for reuse in the nuclear sector is used at SCK·CEN for low level metallic materials.

40|$|Decommissioning and dismantlement {{of nuclear}} power plants (NPP) present a final phase of the nuclear power plant {{lifetime}} and essential part of an effective nuclear safety culture. While some countries are implementing nuclear exit strategies and other building new nuclear power plants or prolonging their lifetimes, decommissioning of facilities is imminent. This paper gives a short overview on decommissioning and <b>dismantling</b> strategies and <b>techniques</b> as {{an introduction to the}} applicability of radioactive metal waste recycling and reuse. General estimations suggest that majority of the waste mass resulting from decommissioning and dismantling is radiologically unrestricted material. Remaining one-third is the radioactive material with different ranges of radioactivity. To present radioactive metal scrap recycling in practice, paper addresses estimations on metal waste amounts resulting from decommissioning, use of melting as a possible recycling method (with regard to secondary waste generated) and aspects of environmental and health impacts. Additionally, a best practice example of decommissioning process in a pressurized water reactor (PWR) technology NPP is given to provide context for possible future decommissioning of NPP Krško. After consideration of available data on decommissioning waste management, the conclusion is that while the decision on decommissioning strategies and technologies is not straightforward but unique to each country, current experiences give important context to complexity and potential of decommissioning and provide a basis for future actions...|$|R
40|$|Product {{design is}} a complex process that {{requires}} design engineers taking into consideration а number of factors simultaneously. Though the primary aim is to fulfil a given function in a cost effective manner, in recent years considerable emphasis {{has been placed on}} designing products that result in minimal negative environmental impact. In the past, research has focussed on developing tools that assist designers in selecting suitable materials and manufacturing processes {{in the early stages of}} product design itself. A correct choice of materials can have a significant impact on promoting Design for Environment (DfE) and determining suitable End of Life (EoL) strategies such as recycling, reuse and remanufacture. This dissertation highlights the importance of implementing design aspects such as Design for Assembly (DfA) and Design for Disassembly (DfD). Included is a case study which illustrates the benefits of implementing DfD in the design of a passenger car door. Through a prudent selection of suitable materials, manufacturing processes and also joining and <b>dismantling</b> <b>techniques,</b> the overall sustainability of the product can been increased. It is seen that in order to incorporate DfE principles in product design, the designers must deal with vast amounts of data simultaneously. Dealing with such large quantities of data can be tricky. This dissertation proposes arranging materials, manufacturing processes and assembly and disassembly techniques in the form of an ontology so that designers can have access to design information in a systematic and precise format. The principles to construct a DfE tool that assists design engineers not only select suitable materials, manufacturing processes and assembly/disassembly methods, but also helps analyse every stage of the product’s life and measure its impact on the environment during the initial stages of design itself have been provided in this dissertation...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} project {{took place}} in the European project semester in spring 2016 and was settled at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya in Vilanova I la Geltrù. This project was initiated by PICVISA, a sub company of the Calaf Group. For example, they are offering some material treatments like sorting of recycling materials. This recycling is for today’s society getting a very important topic because of the environmental pollution and the limited natural resources. But for some specific materials a way to recycle is still missing. The goals of this project were to describe the end of life vehicle recycling and finally solve a specific sorting problem of the company. Therefore, a thoroughly research of the actual literature was done to describe the used <b>dismantling</b> <b>techniques,</b> the materials of a car and reuse possibilities. Also there is an overview of all the different actual sorting techniques which are existing in the market. All these research topics lead to some materials which cannot be sorted at the moment. One of these materials are plastics when they are black coloured. This is also the specific problem of PICVISA. In order to estimate the market for this type of materials, there is a market analysis of the end of life vehicle treatment done. This carried out, that there is a quite huge market for this specific type of materials (50 - 100 M € in whole Europe). That’s why {{it seems to be a}} good idea continue working in this business field. So the next step is a brainstorming which collects several different thoughts to solve the issue and also the criteria to assess them. Then, these criteria are ranked regarding to their importance with an analytical hierarchy process. With this it is possible to evaluate each idea in a decision matrix. This leads to the most proper solution according to the given criteria. In this case the choice was an electrostatic sorting method. In this method, the plastic particles are charged electrostatically, in this use, because of the friction between the single particles (tribo-charging). Because of the electrostatic effects and unequal dielectric constants of the plastics, these materials are charged differently. So it is possible to separate them in a high voltage field. In order to separate several types of plastic, only more of those machines are needed in a row, because there is a tribo-electric charging row among all the plastics...|$|E
40|$|Each year, {{more than}} 50 million {{vehicles}} {{reach the end}} of their service life throughout the world. More than 95 % of these vehicles enter a comprehensive recycling infrastructure that includes auto parts recyclers/dismantlers, remanufacturers, and material recyclers (shredders). Today, about 75 % of automotive materials are profitably recycled via (1) parts reuse and parts and components remanufacturing and (2) ultimately by the scrap processing (shredding) industry. The process by which the scrap processors recover metal scrap from automobiles involves shredding the obsolete automobiles, along with other obsolete metal-containing products (such as white goods, industrial scrap, and demolition debris), and recovering the metals from the shredded material. The single largest source of recycled ferrous scrap for the iron and steel industry is obsolete automobiles. The non-metallic fraction that remains after the metals are recovered from the shredded materials (about 25 % of the weight of the vehicle) [...] commonly called shredder residue [...] is disposed of in landfills. Over the past 10 to 15 years, a significant amount of research and development has been undertaken to enhance the recycle rate of end-of-life vehicles (ELVs), including enhancing <b>dismantling</b> <b>techniques</b> and improving remanufacturing operations.

40|$|DIRECT-MAT is {{a three-year}} European project aiming to {{facilitate}} the sharing of national experiences on dismantling and recycling or safe disposal of road and road related materials at the European level. It was initiated within the EC 7 th Framework Programme Transport first call and is comprised of partners from fifteen participating countries for a budget of 1, 2 million Euros. The project runs through 2009 – 2011 and involves building a European Web database and drafting best practice guides on <b>DIsmantling</b> and RECycling <b>Techniques</b> for road MATerials (“DIRECT-MAT”). The intention is that project results shall support the daily work of practitioners, researchers and standardisation bodies. Several materials are addressed – unbound, hydraulically bound and asphalt road materials, but also other materials related to road use but not commonly recycled in road construction. These include tyre shreds, sediment from ditches, industrial by-products and reinforcement materials. The work programme is organised into seven work packages where four packages focus on the various construction materials, one {{is devoted to the}} database and the remaining two work packages to management & coordination and dissemination. Dissemination activities include cooperation with a Reference Group consisting of end users in several countries; presentations in national and international papers and conferences as well as the arrangement of national seminars and a European workshop for end users. Continuous project information will be available at [URL] At present, many European countries have acquired experience in dismantling and recycling road materials back into roads. However, research results are not widely implemented and national documents are not often available to specialists from other countries. In this European project, twenty partners cooperate to build a web database that will provide access to validated guidelines, national document references, harmonised literature reviews and practical application case studies based on jobsite data sets. In this way DIRECT-MAT will actively contribute to generating closer cooperation between research and practice within road material recycling and also contribute to reducing the waste disposal associated with roads...|$|R

In the United States, more than 95 % of the 10 - 15 million scrapped vehicles annually enter a comprehensive recycling infrastructure that includes auto parts recyclers/dismantlers, remanufacturers, and material recyclers (shredders). Today, over 75 % of automotive materials, primarily the metals, are profitably recycled via (1) parts reuse and parts and components remanufacturing and (2) ultimately by the scrap processing (shredding) industry.

The single largest source of recycled ferrous scrap for the iron and steel industry is obsolete automobiles. The non-metallic fraction that remains after the metals are recovered from the shredded materials - commonly called shredder residue - constitutes about 25 % of the weight of the vehicle, and it is disposed of in landfills. This practice is not environmentally friendly, wastes valuable resources, and may become uneconomical. Therefore, it is not sustainable. Over the past 15 - 20 years, a significant amount of research and development has been undertaken to enhance the recycle rate of end-of-life vehicles, including enhancing <b>dismantling</b> <b>techniques</b> and improving remanufacturing operations. However, most of the effort has been focused on developing technology to separate and recover non-metallic materials, such as polymers, from shredder residue. To make future vehicles more energy efficient, more lightweighting materials - primarily polymers, polymer composites, high-strength steels, and aluminum - will be used in manufacturing these vehicles. Many of these materials increase the percentage of shredder residue that must be disposed of, compared with the percentage of metals that are recovered. In addition, the number of hybrid vehicles and electric vehicles on the road is rapidly increasing. This trend will also introduce new materials for disposal {{at the end of their}} useful lives, including batteries. Therefore, as the complexity of automotive materials and systems increases, new technologies will be required to sustain and maximize the ultimate recycling of these materials and systems.

This will result in increased energy consumption and increased damage to the environment, including increased greenhouse gas emissions. The recycling of polymers, other organics, and residual metals in shredder residue saves the equivalent of over 23 million barrels of oil annually.
