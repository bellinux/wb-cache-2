5|$|Axe to <b>Fall</b> <b>was</b> {{met with}} {{widespread}} critical acclaim. It has {{been referred to}} as the band's most accessible album to date, and was compared with Converge's widely lauded Jane Doe.|$|E
5|$|Shadows Fall {{has been}} mainly {{described}} as metalcore and thrash metal. Originally, Shadows <b>Fall</b> <b>was</b> a melodic death metal band. With {{the release of}} the band's 2002 album The Art of Balance, Shadows Fall moved away from the melodic death metal genre. Shadows Fall has been compared by Steve Huey of AllMusic to Gothernburg death metal, including Gothernburg death metal band In Flames.|$|E
5|$|Whilst {{the civil}} war was raging, the Turks in Anatolia took the {{opportunity}} to seize Philadelphia in 1390, marking the end of Byzantine rule in Anatolia, although by now the city was far from Imperial rule. The city had long been under only nominal Imperial rule and its <b>fall</b> <b>was</b> of little strategic consequence to the Byzantines – whose Emperor had to suffer the humiliation of accompanying the Sultan during the campaign.|$|E
50|$|East Twin <b>Falls</b> <b>is</b> {{located about}} 15 {{miles west of}} Joyce, Washington. The <b>falls</b> <b>are</b> within the Olympic National Forest. The <b>falls</b> <b>are</b> located {{directly}} off of East Twin Road which is accessible from State Route 112. The <b>Falls</b> <b>are</b> approximately 40 feet in height.|$|R
50|$|Catawba <b>Falls</b> <b>is</b> {{part of the}} Pisgah National Forest. For many years, {{while the}} <b>falls</b> <b>were</b> located on public land, visitor access to the <b>falls</b> <b>was</b> heavily restricted. The only access points to the <b>falls</b> <b>were</b> a trail that went through private property, and an access point off of Interstate 40. Use of either access point was illegal.|$|R
50|$|Access to the <b>falls</b> <b>is</b> {{restricted}} to a viewing platform at milemarker 361.2 on the Blue Ridge Parkway. The <b>falls</b> <b>is</b> {{directly in the}} City of Asheville's watershed, so {{direct access to the}} <b>falls</b> <b>is</b> strictly prohibited.|$|R
5|$|A {{speculator}} to {{his very}} core, Little never put away {{any of his}} fortune {{to prepare for a}} rainy day; any money he made on the stock market, he immediately invested back into it. Thus when the Panic of 1857 destroyed his investment fortune, Little was left penniless. He would live out {{the rest of his life}} under the wing of his last protége, David Groesbeck. Little was only ever able to make small trading returns to the market in his later years, and the magnitude of his <b>fall</b> <b>was</b> often the target of mockery from his former peers. He died a broken man. Little died on March 28, 1865, and his funeral was held on March 31 at New York's Grace Church. His pall-bearers included Jesse Hoyt and Edward Prime; Reverend Thomas House Taylor officiated at his funeral.|$|E
5|$|After Antietam, Ewing {{was placed}} on sick leave because of chronic dysentery, and was {{promoted}} to Brigadier General on November 29, 1862. He transferred West and served throughout the campaign before Vicksburg, leading the assaults made by General Sherman; and upon its <b>fall</b> <b>was</b> placed in command of a division in the XVI Corps. At Chattanooga, he was given command of the 4th Division of the XV Corps, which formed the advance of Sherman's army and carried Missionary Ridge. Prior to the Battle of Chattanooga, Ewing's command led a diversionary raid {{that resulted in the}} destruction of the Empire State Iron Works in Dade County, Georgia, which was being refurbished to increase the South's manufacturing capability. Sherman considered Ewing his most reliable division commander.|$|E
5|$|As of 2008, three Czech {{films have}} been {{nominated}} for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, one of which, Jan Svěrák's Kolya, has won the award. Another of Svěrák's films, Dark Blue World, was submitted to the Academy for the 74th Academy Awards, but not accepted as a nominee. The two other Czech directors to have films accepted as nominees are Jan Hřebejk and Ondřej Trojan. Hřebejk's Divided We <b>Fall</b> <b>was</b> accepted as a nominee for the 73rd Academy Awards, but his submission for the 77th Academy Awards, Up and Down, was not. Trojan's Želary was a nominee for the 76th Academy Awards.|$|E
50|$|The <b>falls</b> <b>are</b> {{occasionally}} {{confused with}} much larger Mazama <b>Falls,</b> which <b>is</b> two kilometers upstream. Ironically enough, Mazama <b>Falls</b> <b>is</b> officially named while Wells Creek Falls isn’t {{despite the fact}} almost nobody has ever seen Mazama Falls up close & Wells Creek <b>Falls</b> <b>is</b> regularly visited by people driving up Wells Creek Road.|$|R
50|$|Madison Creek <b>Falls</b> <b>is</b> {{located within}} the Olympic National Park near the Elwha River, west of Port Angeles, Washington. The <b>falls</b> <b>is</b> about 50 feet high and has a light flow in a {{horsetail}} shape. Another higher <b>falls</b> <b>is</b> located above the first, but is completely inaccessible. The paved trail to the <b>falls</b> <b>is</b> very short (less than 100 meters) and is wheelchair accessible.|$|R
50|$|Karuma <b>Falls</b> <b>is</b> {{located on}} the Kigumba-Gulu Highway, {{immediately}} south of where the highway crosses the River Nile. Karuma <b>Falls</b> <b>is</b> approximately 97 km, by road, northeast of Masindi and approximately 77 km, by road, south of Gulu, the largest city in Northern Uganda. Karuma <b>Falls</b> <b>is</b> also the location of Karuma Power Station, the largest hydropower project in Uganda with a planned capacity of 600 megawatts. The coordinates of Karuma <b>Falls</b> <b>are</b> 2° 14' 3.00"N, 32° 14' 47.00"E (Latitude:2.234167; Longitude:32.246390). The average elevation of Karuma <b>Falls</b> <b>is</b> about 1000 m above sea level.|$|R
5|$|By 1704, the War of the Spanish Succession was in {{its fourth}} year. The {{previous}} year {{had been one of}} success for France and her allies, most particularly on the Danube, where Marshal Villars and the Elector of Bavaria had created a direct threat to Vienna, the Habsburg capital. Vienna had been saved by dissension between the two commanders, leading to the brilliant Villars being replaced by the less dynamic Marshal Marsin. Nevertheless, by 1704, the threat was still real: Rákóczi's Hungarian revolt was already threatening the Empire's eastern approaches, and Marshal Vendôme's forces threatened an invasion from northern Italy. In the courts of Versailles and Madrid, Vienna's <b>fall</b> <b>was</b> confidently anticipated, an event which would almost certainly have led to the collapse of the Grand Alliance.|$|E
5|$|Competing at {{her first}} Summer Olympics, Aicha Fall {{qualified}} for the London Games as a wildcard, as she had set no time for her event, the 800 meters. She was {{to compete in the}} 2012 World Junior Championships in Athletics 800 meters but did not start the event. She competed on August 8 in Heat 5 against seven other athletes. She posted a time of 2 minutes and 27.97 seconds, finishing sixth and setting a national record in the process. She placed ahead of Palestine's Woroud Sawalha (2 minutes and 29.16 seconds) and behind Canada's Melissa Bishop (2 minutes and 09.33 seconds) in a heat led by Ukraine's Nataliia Lupu (2 minutes and 8.35 seconds). Overall, <b>Fall</b> <b>was</b> 24.12 seconds behind the slowest athlete that progressed to the semi-finals and therefore did not advance.|$|E
5|$|In September 1928, Decline and <b>Fall</b> <b>was</b> {{published}} {{to almost}} unanimous praise. By December, {{the book was}} into its third printing, and the American publishing rights were sold for $500. In the afterglow of his success, Waugh was commissioned to write travel articles {{in return for a}} free Mediterranean cruise, which he and Gardner began in February 1929, as an extended, delayed honeymoon. The trip was disrupted when Gardner contracted pneumonia and was carried ashore to the British hospital in Port Said. The couple returned home in June, after her recovery. A month later, without warning, Gardner confessed that their mutual friend, John Heygate, had become her lover. After an attempted reconciliation failed, a shocked and dismayed Waugh filed for divorce on 3 September 1929. The couple apparently met again only once, during the process for the annulment of their marriage a few years later.|$|E
5000|$|Shivanasamudram: The waterfalls, the Ganganchukki and the Bharachukki, cascade down 90 meters. These <b>falls</b> <b>are</b> {{the source}} of Asia's first Hydro Electric Power Statin called [...] "Shimsa". The <b>falls</b> <b>are</b> in full splendour during July-August. The <b>falls</b> <b>are</b> 22 km from the Bangalore.|$|R
50|$|The Bridal Veil <b>Falls</b> <b>is</b> a {{waterfall}} near Queenstown, Otago, in New Zealand. It {{is one of}} numerous streams and waterfalls in this region. This <b>fall</b> <b>is</b> only notable {{because it has been}} given a common name (Bridal Veil <b>Falls),</b> <b>is</b> clearly visible from the road and the stream from this fall runs under the third bridge of the Routeburn Track. This <b>fall</b> <b>is</b> over Torlesse Terrane metamorphic rock.|$|R
50|$|Rainbow <b>Falls</b> <b>was</b> first {{discovered}} by the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Rainbow Falls and downstream Crooked <b>Falls</b> <b>are</b> the only two waterfalls on the Missouri-Mississippi river system to remain in an almost-natural condition. Black Eagle Falls and Great <b>Falls</b> <b>are</b> half- occupied by their dams' powerhouses, and Colter <b>Falls</b> <b>is</b> submerged. The waterfall received {{its name from the}} frequent presence of rainbows in its spray before the dams were built.|$|R
5|$|Investigators {{found that}} Fall and a {{relative}} {{had received a}} total of about $400,000 from Doheny and Sinclair, and that the transfers were contemporaneous with the controversial leases. <b>Fall</b> <b>was</b> ultimately convicted in 1929 for accepting bribes and, in 1931, became the first U.S. cabinet member to be imprisoned for crimes committed while in office. Sinclair was convicted only of contempt of court for jury tampering. Doheny was brought to trial before a jury in April 1930 for giving the bribe Fall had been convicted of accepting, but he was acquitted.|$|E
5|$|The Croatian {{government}} was criticised for {{its approach to}} the battle. Surviving defenders and right-wing political parties accused it of betrayal and of deliberately sacrificing Vukovar to secure international recognition for Croatia. The only explanation that many people were willing to accept for the town's <b>fall</b> <b>was</b> {{that it had been}} given up as part of a conspiracy. The commanders of the Croatian forces in Vukovar, Mile Dedaković and Branko Borković, both survived the battle and spoke out publicly against the government's actions. In an apparent attempt to silence them, both men were briefly detained by Croatian military police, and the Croatian government suppressed an issue of the newspaper Slobodni tjednik that published a transcript of a telephone call from Vukovar, in which Dedaković had pleaded with an evasive Tuđman for military assistance. The revelations caused public outrage and reinforced perceptions that the defenders had been betrayed.|$|E
5|$|For his successes, Licario {{was rewarded}} with the post of megas konostaulos, head of the Latin mercenaries, and {{eventually}} appointed as megas doux after Philanthropenos's death in ca. 1276; the first foreigner to be thus honoured. He commanded the Byzantine navy {{in a series of}} expeditions against the Latin-held Aegean islands. The first to <b>fall</b> <b>was</b> Skopelos, whose fortress was believed to be impregnable. Licario, however, knew that it lacked water supplies. Thus, he attacked it during the hot and dry summer of 1277 and forced its surrender. Its lord, Filippo Ghisi, was captured and sent to Constantinople; his other possessions, the islands of Skyros, Skiathos and Amorgos, were also taken soon after. After that, Licario went on to capture the islands of Kythera and Antikythera off the southern coast of the Morea, and later Kea, Astypalaia, and Santorini in the Cyclades. The great island of Lemnos was also captured, although its lord, Paolo Navigajoso, withstood a three-year siege before surrendering.|$|E
50|$|These <b>falls</b> <b>are</b> {{frequently}} {{referred to}} incorrectly as Middle Whatcom Falls or Lower Whatcom <b>Falls.</b> Middle <b>falls</b> <b>is</b> located down creek near {{the western edge}} of the park and not reachable by trail. The area surrounding the middle <b>falls</b> <b>was</b> devastated by the Olympic Pipeline disaster and is off limits to the public. The lower <b>falls</b> <b>are</b> actually located a couple miles downstream just above the estuary at Maritime Heritage Park.|$|R
50|$|Coon Creek <b>Falls,</b> <b>is</b> a 250 ft plunge {{waterfall}} which {{shares a}} plungepool with Fall Creek <b>Falls.</b> The <b>falls</b> <b>are</b> not always present, {{depending on the}} amount of precipitation in the area. The <b>falls</b> <b>are</b> located near Spencer, Tennessee in Fall Creek Falls State Park.|$|R
5000|$|Anna Ruby <b>Falls</b> <b>is</b> {{one of four}} popular waterfalls {{located in}} the Forest near Helen, Georgia.

5|$|In 1998, Labonte {{was asked}} to leave the band due to {{personal}} and artistic differences. He had ideas for a side project while {{a member of the}} band, and went on to form All That Remains. The band looked for a replacement vocalist and eventually recruited Milford, MA native Brian Fair of the pioneering metalcore band Overcast. The band had been friends with Fair for years. After a US Summer tour with Shai Hulud, Overcast disbanded and the band asked Fair if he would like to join Shadows Fall. While on tour Shadows <b>Fall</b> <b>was</b> signed to Century Media Records. The band recorded its second studio album Of One Blood with Fair on vocals in 2000, and the release included re-recorded songs from Somber Eyes to the Sky. In 2001, David Germain decided to leave the band due to alcoholism, and was replaced by former Stigmata and Burning Human drummer Jason Bittner.|$|E
5|$|Paul's {{youngest}} son, Andrew (now {{played by}} Jordan Smith), comes {{to stay with}} his father. Paul suffers financial difficulties and embezzles money from Lassiter's. He also frames Declan for an accident at a building site, that he himself caused. Diana Marshall (Jane Badler) comes to Erinsborough to find evidence of Paul's embezzlement. Paul asks her to take over Lassiter's with him and they have sex. Rebecca gives Paul an ultimatum; leave Lassiter's or leave the family. He then hands over management of the hotel to Declan for six months. Paul discovers Diana is working with Declan to remove him from the company and he contacts Rosemary Daniels (Joy Chambers), who fires Diana. Meanwhile, Paul threatens Declan. When Rebecca finds out about Paul's affair and threats towards Declan, she pushes him from the Lassiter's mezzanine. Paul survives and blackmails Rebecca into staying with him, causing their marriage to deteriorate. Rebecca later convinces Paul to sign an affidavit, which states that his <b>fall</b> <b>was</b> an accident, and she leaves him and the country. Paul falls out with local councillor Ajay Kapoor (Sachin Joab) and plots to ruin Ajay's career, after the local police station is closed down and merged with another.|$|E
5|$|Shadows <b>Fall</b> <b>was</b> {{formed in}} 1995 by guitarists Jonathan Donais and Matt Bachand, then good {{friends from the}} local music scene. Bachand had {{previously}} been {{a founding member of}} a death metal band and Donais a member of the metalcore band Aftershock. By 1996 the band had found a complete lineup with the addition of Damien McPherson (vocals), Mark Laliberte (bass), and David Germain (drums). Also in 1996, Adam Dutkiewicz performed live drums to fill in for Germain. By late 1996, the band recorded and released a demo titled Mourning a Dead World, of which only about 200 copies were produced. It consisted of the songs Lifeless, Suffer the Season, Fleshold, Forever Lost, A Souls Salvation, and Deadworld. McPherson decided to leave the band, and was replaced by Philip Labonte in 1997. Around the same time, bass guitarist Paul Romanko, formally of the hardcore band Pushbutton Warfare, was recruited as a permanent replacement for Laliberte, who had originally joined on a temporary basis. Now with a more solid lineup, the band released its first EP, To Ashes, with Dutkiewicz playing as a session drummer. The band's name, according to Bachand, comes from the title of a comic book published in the early 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>falls</b> <b>were</b> {{reportedly}} {{discovered in}} 1938 by American entomologist and physician Paul A. Zahl, {{who wrote that}} the noise created by the <b>falling</b> water <b>was</b> deafening already before the <b>falls</b> <b>were</b> visible.|$|R
50|$|The <b>falls</b> <b>were</b> {{regarded}} as sacred under the Fuji cult. Another waterfall, the Otodome <b>Falls</b> <b>is</b> approximately a five-minute walk away.|$|R
50|$|Dangars <b>Falls</b> <b>are</b> located 16 km {{south-south-east}} of Armidale, on Salisbury Waters. They {{have a total}} fall of 120 metres. These <b>falls</b> <b>were</b> previously named Gostwick <b>Falls,</b> and <b>are</b> {{also known}} as Dangarsleigh <b>Falls.</b> They <b>are</b> in the Oxley Wild Rivers National Park, {{at the head of}} Dangars Gorge.|$|R
5|$|The U.S. had intervened {{repeatedly}} in Mexico under Wilson, and had withdrawn diplomatic recognition, setting conditions for reinstatement. The Mexican government under President Álvaro Obregón wanted recognition before negotiations, but Wilson and his final Secretary of State, Bainbridge Colby, refused. Both Hughes and Fall opposed recognition; Hughes instead sent a draft treaty to the Mexicans in May 1921, which included pledges to reimburse Americans for losses in Mexico since the 1910 revolution there. Obregón {{was unwilling to}} sign a treaty before being recognized, and worked to improve the relationship between American business and Mexico, reaching agreement with creditors, and mounting a public relations campaign in the United States. This had its effect, and by mid-1922, <b>Fall</b> <b>was</b> less influential than he had been, lessening the resistance to recognition. The two presidents appointed commissioners to reach a deal, and the U.S. recognized the Obregón government on August 31, 1923, just under a month after Harding's death, substantially on the terms proffered by Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The firefighters built bashings, {{walls of}} sandbags, turf and sand, {{approximately}} 18feet (5.5metres) deep and 17feet (5.2metres) {{up to the}} tunnel's roof to prevent smoke filling {{the rest of the}} workings and allow men to explore areas previously cut off. Within two days the temperatures dropped and the volume of smoke was reduced. Although the fire was contained, miners still faced several obstacles, including roof collapses and large pockets of trapped firedamp. The first collapse consisted of more than 100 tons of debris, while another <b>fall</b> <b>was</b> more than 300feet (91.5metres) long and 30 to 40feet (10–12metres) high. Clearing the falls and finding bodies was slow, and it took until 8 November for the first of the 4 working districts to be explored and cleared of bodies. Many victims were unidentifiable—either the explosion, fire or subsequent decomposition had taken its toll—and many had to be identified by their personal effects, although some bodies remained unidentified.|$|E
5|$|The major field {{operation}} of the <b>fall</b> <b>was</b> Hood's Franklin-Nashville Campaign, an invasion of Tennessee, which he undertook despite Beauregard's counsel that it made little operational or logistical sense. Hood did not treat Beauregard with the respect due to the department commander, communicating his plans reluctantly and making movements {{without regard to the}} consequences for his supply line, which Beauregard scrambled to maintain. While Hood traveled through Alabama and into Tennessee, Union Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman began his March to the Sea from Atlanta to Savannah, which focused Beauregard's attention back to Georgia. He was ineffective in stopping, or even delaying, Sherman's advance. He had inadequate local forces and was reluctant to strip defenses from other locations to concentrate them against Sherman. Furthermore, Sherman did an excellent job of deceiving the Confederates as to the intermediate and final targets of his march. Savannah fell on December 21 and Sherman's army began to march north into South Carolina in January. Also in late December, Beauregard found out that Hood's army had been severely damaged in its defeat at the Battle of Nashville; there were very few men in fighting condition who could oppose Sherman's advance.|$|E
50|$|Turtleback Falls, {{also called}} Umbrella <b>Falls,</b> <b>is</b> a {{waterfall}} in Western North Carolina, located near Brevard. The <b>falls</b> <b>is</b> {{located on the}} Horsepasture River in the Pisgah National Forest. The <b>falls</b> <b>is</b> usually accessed by a hike starting in Gorges State Park which passes through Pisgah National Forest property.|$|R
50|$|Wolf Creek <b>Falls</b> <b>is</b> {{located in}} Olympic National Park in Clallam County, Washington {{approximately}} 10 miles (16 km) south west of Port Angeles, Washington.
