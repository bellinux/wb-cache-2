40|$|It {{had been}} {{believed}} in the conventional practice {{that the risk of}} a bank going bankrupt is lessened in a straightforward manner by transferring the risk of loan defaults. But the failure of American International Group in 2008 posed a more complex aspect of financial contagion. This study presents an extension of the asset network systemic risk model (ANWSER) to investigate whether credit default swaps mitigate or intensify the severity of financial contagion. A protection buyer bank transfers the risk of every possible <b>debtor</b> <b>bank</b> default to protection seller banks. The empirical distribution of the number of bank bankruptcies is obtained with the extended model. Systemic capital buffer ratio is calculated from the distribution. The ratio quantifies the effective loss absorbency capability of the entire financial system to force back financial contagion. The key finding is that the leverage ratio is a good estimate of a systemic capital buffer ratio as the backstop of a financial system. The risk transfer from small and medium banks to big banks in an interbank network does not mitigate the severity of financial contagion.

It related with effective fund facility needed for development from financial institution, especially bank which has function as institution collecting fund from society in savings and distribute it to society in order to rise people wealth rate (Section 1 number 2 Rule No. 10 / 1998 about Banking). One of Bank efforts was distributing debt to society. The effort owed certain risks. Debt giving close with risk where debtor did agreement violation. One of the agreement violation happened was collateral transfer which often happened in bank and the transfer was transfer to fiducia collateral. This action caused stuck debt since debtor has no more responsibility to pay debtor installment since debt caused by collateral guaranteed to bank has been sold so the debtor has no obligation to pay their debt in bank. The research has statement of problems: (1) how is the debtor responsibility to fiducia collateral transfer to third party in doing business capital debt in BPR Mandiri Adiyatra? (2) What efforts done by BPR Mandiri Adiyatra in overcome the fiducia collateral to third party which was done by debtor in business capital debt?

From the fiducia collateral selling, there needed to pay all the debtor obligation and cost from the ‘under-hand’ selling, then if there was residue of fund, it would be returned into debtor and/or third party.

Using unsolicited takeovers between 1992 and 2003, we find that bank lending intensity and bank client network (the number of firms that the bank deals with) have a significant and positive effect on the probability of a borrower firm becoming a target. We find that this effect is enhanced in cases where the target and acquirer have a relationship with the same bank and is robust to the inclusion of several firm characteristics including the presence of large external shareholders. Moreover, takeover completion rates are positively related to bank lending intensity. Finally, we find that the equity market views takeovers where the target and the acquirer deal with the same bank more positively relative to takeovers with no bank involvement. Overall, the evidence supports the view that banks increase the disciplining role of the market for corporate control. ...|$|R

40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the interbank market collapse of 2007 - 08, the scope of sys-temic risk research has broadened to encompass a wide range of channels, notably asset correlations, default contagion, illiquidity contagion, and asset firesales. In cur-rent models of systemic risk, two facets of contagion, namely funding illiquidity and insolvency, are treated as two distinct and separate phenomena. The main goal of the double cascade model we introduce is to integrate these two facets as two faces of the same coin. In a default cascade, insolvency of a given bank will create a shock to the asset side of the balance sheet of each of its creditor banks. Under some cir-cumstances, such “downstream ” shocks can cause further insolvencies that may build up to create a global insolvency cascade. On the other hand, in a stress cascade, illiquidity that hits a given bank will create a shock to the liability side of the balance sheet of each of its <b>debtor</b> <b>banks.</b> Under some circumstances, such “upstream ” shocks can cause further illiquidity stresses that may build up to create a global illiquidity cascade. Our paper will introduce a deliberately simplified network model of insolvency and illiquidity that can quantify how illiquidity or default of one bank influences the overall level of liquidity stress and default in the network. Under an assumption we call “locally tree-like independence”, we derive large-network asymptotic cascade formulas. Results of numerical experiments then demonstrate that these asymptotic formulas agree qualitatively with Monte Carlo results for large finite networks, and quantitatively except when the system is placed in an exceptional “knife-edge ” con-figuration.
