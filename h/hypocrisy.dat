5|$|Modern historians {{consider}} this highly implausible however, noting that malicious rumours {{such as those}} concerning Domitia's alleged infidelity were eagerly repeated by post-Domitianic authors, and used to highlight the <b>hypocrisy</b> of a ruler publicly preaching a return to Augustan morals, while privately indulging in excesses and presiding over a corrupt court. Nevertheless, the account of Suetonius has dominated imperial historiography for centuries.|$|E

5|$|The PTC {{has been}} {{frequently}} criticized for <b>hypocrisy,</b> slanted reporting and only criticizing shows that {{are aimed at}} adults. Critics of the PTC have alleged that it supports increased governmental censorship of television by lobbying the FCC for indecency enforcement for certain television shows and inaccurately reporting on the V-Chip {{in order to further}} their agenda.|$|E

5000|$|The album {{received}} moderately positive reviews, with critics {{noting that}} the album would appeal to the band's fanbase but did not advance <b>Hypocrisy's</b> sound. Chris Dick, writing for Decibel Magazine, criticized End of Disclosure for its [...] "potluck songwriting", which gave {{the impression that the}} album was [...] "cycling through various stages of <b>Hypocrisy's</b> (and the Abyss's) repertoire, giving it a shiny, modern coat of paint and calling it an album". [...] Natalie Zed, writing for About.com, praised the album for the [...] "menace and hostility" [...] of its atmosphere but described it as [...] "an album that revisits familiar themes rather than breaks new ground". Laura Wiebe, writing for Exclaim!, claimed that the album accomplished Peter Tägtgren's intended goal of going [...] "back to basics", but also noted that the album generally [...] "rolled out more like a highlight reel of <b>Hypocrisy's</b> specialties".|$|R

5|$|The next day, the K Foundation's publicist, Mick Houghton, {{claimed that}} the voting for the K Foundation's award was {{supposed}} to produce a tie, to illustrate the <b>hypocrisy</b> of the Turner award committee, but that strangely the result had been a huge margin of victory for Whiteread. He speculated that the few thousand voters had just liked or rather disliked {{the sound of her}} name.|$|E
5|$|Themes {{of class}} {{consciousness}} and conflict are {{also present in}} the book. Critics interpreted the stance the novel took against French class-based discrimination and <b>hypocrisy</b> as quite radical, although some French critics found that this made the novel an unsubtle satire of fading social stereotypes. There are also literary allusions in the novel, referencing comic books, movies, music, and paintings.|$|E
5|$|Although Haynes was a prohibitionist, he was {{a critic}} of the Indiana Branch of the Ku Klux Klan, which was in the height of its power during the 1910s and 1920s. In letters to friends and fellow prohibitionists, he {{ridiculed}} the organization for using violent and illegal tactics to achieve prohibition, and accused them of <b>hypocrisy</b> for supporting many anti-prohibition Democratic politicians. Kokomo politics was dominated by the Klan during that period and it is unknown if Haynes spoke publicly against the organization.|$|E

5|$|Fielding {{started work}} on his fourth play, The Temple Beau, in April 1729, but did not finish {{until the end of}} the year. Rejected by his first theatre, the play had to be {{performed}} at another one, where it had 13 shows its first year and few revivals thereafter. The play is about Wilding, a young law student who gives up his studies to seek pleasure, and his attempts to marry a woman for her money. Fielding focuses on <b>hypocrisy</b> and gender equality in marriage with characters' interaction with Wilding.|$|E
5|$|Forensic {{evidence}} on the package eventually leads to Bardale, and then to The Judge. The Judge is arrested for questioning, and knowing {{that there is not}} enough evidence to warrant sentencing him, he offers Black a job with him. Black refuses, but The Judge is released. Bardale is incensed that The Judge has manipulated the law to his own ends, and passes sentence on him for <b>hypocrisy.</b> Finding Bardale alone in a farmhouse, Black discovers that the convict had fed The Judge to his pigs.|$|E
5|$|He criticised the <b>hypocrisy</b> of {{chastity}} {{for women}} and argued that it should also either belong to men, {{or not at all}} for both individuals. While fighting against this, Periyar advocated {{to get rid of the}} Devadasi system. In his view it was an example of a list of degradations of women attaching them to temples for the entertainment of others, and as temple prostitutes. As a further liberation of women, Periyar pushed for the right of women to have an education and to join the armed services and the police force.|$|E

5|$|In 1929, Evans {{acknowledged}} that membership levels had declined but predicted a dramatic turnaround would soon occur. His prediction was inaccurate. This loss of members {{resulted in a}} Klan that was a skeleton of its former self. Historians have attributed this loss of membership to ineptness and <b>hypocrisy</b> {{on the part of}} Klan leadership. McVeigh argues that the Klan's inability to form alliances with other political groups led to the sharp loss of political power and solidarity within the group.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, the {{political}} climate in Italy (under Mussolini) became unacceptable to Escher. He {{had no interest in}} politics, finding it impossible to involve himself with any ideals other than the expressions of his own concepts through his own particular medium, but he was averse to fanaticism and <b>hypocrisy.</b> When his eldest son, George, was forced at the age of nine to wear a Ballila uniform in school, the family left Italy and moved to Château-d'Œx, Switzerland, where they remained for two years.|$|E
5|$|A {{doctoral}} student of Curie, Marguerite Perey, {{became the first}} woman elected to membership in the Academy– over half a century later, in 1962. Despite Curie's fame as a scientist working for France, the public's attitude tended toward xenophobia—the same that had led to the Dreyfus affair–which also fueled false speculation that Curie was Jewish. During the French Academy of Sciences elections, she was vilified by the right wing press who criticised her for being a foreigner and an atheist. Her daughter later remarked on the public <b>hypocrisy</b> as the French press often portrayed Curie as an unworthy foreigner when she was nominated for a French honour, but would portray her as a French hero when she received a foreign one such as her Nobel Prizes.|$|E
5000|$|Writing in The Observer, Rachel Aspden {{feels that}} the book [...] "may be angry, {{but it is also}} {{extremely}} funny. Ghali neatly skewers the pretensions of the Cairene elite along with the <b>hypocrisies</b> of empire... In Ghali's Cairo, almost everything is phoney." ...|$|R
2500|$|Voltaire {{chose to}} use his middle name as his {{performance}} name because his namesake [...] "saw through the <b>hypocrisies</b> of humanity and commented on them through satire. In essence, {{he was able to}} educate people about the world around them by making them laugh." ...|$|R

5|$|Although a Junimist for a {{large part}} of his life, Ion Luca Caragiale himself saw a {{precursor}} in Heliade, and even expressed some sympathy for his political ideals. During the 1890s, he republished a piece by Heliade in the Conservative Party's main journal, Epoca. One of Caragiale's most significant characters, the Transylvanian schoolteacher Marius Chicoş Rostogan, shares many traits with his counterparts in Heliade's stories. Developing his own theory, he claimed that there was a clear difference between, on one hand, the generation of Heliade Rădulescu, Ion Câmpineanu, and Nicolae Bălcescu, and, on the other, the National Liberal establishment formed around Pantazi Ghica, Nicolae Misail and Mihail Pătârlăgeanu—he identified the latter grouping with <b>hypocrisy,</b> demagogy, and political corruption, while arguing that the former could have found itself best represented by the Conservatives.|$|E
5|$|Americans' mistrust and {{dislike of}} lawyers was a {{frequent}} topic of dissection in social problem films such Lawyer Man (1933), State's Attorney, and The Mouthpiece (1932). In films such as Paid (1930), the legal system turns innocent characters into criminals. The life of Joan Crawford's character is ruined and her romantic interest is executed so that she may live free, although she is innocent of the crime for which the district attorney wants to convict her. Religious <b>hypocrisy</b> was addressed in such films as The Miracle Woman (1931), starring Barbara Stanwyck and directed by Frank Capra. Stanwyck also portrayed a nurse and initially reluctant heroine who manages to save, via unorthodox means, two young children in danger from nefarious characters (including Clark Gable as a malevolent chauffeur) in Night Nurse (1931).|$|E
5|$|Another {{traditionally}} respected {{group which}} Joehana criticizes is the hajjis, those Muslims {{who have been}} on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. The hajjis in Joehana's stories are generally greedy and lustful, without any interest in the good of humanity. In Tjarios Agan Permas, for instance, Hajji Serbanna displays his <b>hypocrisy</b> by damning usury as haraam (sinful) while charging high interest rates for a loan, and refuses to complete the mandatory prayers because he is waiting on a guest bearing large gifts. The hajji is portrayed as wearing so much make-up that, in the opinion of Kartini et al., it is as if he is deliberately dressing as a clown.|$|E
50|$|His {{creation}} ‘Bhaiya’ was {{the medium}} through which Ishar Singh attacked the various <b>hypocrisies,</b> superstitions and other absurdities he observed around him.

"Mr. Kipling {{differs from}} other ballad-writers {{of the day}} in [...] that he has that rare possession, imagination, and he has the [...] temerity to speak out what is in him with no {{conventional}} [...] reservations or deference to the <b>hypocrisies</b> of public [...] opinion."--Boston Beacon.|$|R
50|$|The {{second point}} of {{dissection}} {{in the book}} is its detailed, unrestrained examination of Christianity and its role in both American society and in the oppression of the Negro race. This examination takes place {{in the first part of}} the second essay, in which the author describes, with occasional poeticism, the joy with which he first became involved in the Christian church. He also describes his subsequent growing disillusionment with the church and its teachings. He describes at length how that disillusionment simultaneously deepened and broadened as he became older, detailing what he sees as the church's <b>hypocrisies,</b> developing theories about how the <b>hypocrisies</b> affected and continue to affect American life. He suggests that the only way America can become what it has the potential to become is to abandon Christian teaching.|$|R
