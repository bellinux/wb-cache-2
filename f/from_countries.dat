40|$|AbstractThe {{positive}} outcomes of FDI inflows from developed or {{developing countries are}} well known from the literature.

Focusing on Malaysian manufacturing sector, this study attempts to identify the risk averseness of FDI <b>from</b> developed <b>countries</b> against FDI <b>from</b> developing <b>countries...</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{formation}} of an RTA that includes country H and country F as member countries dictates the removal of country H’s tariff barriers on imports coming <b>from</b> <b>country</b> F, but keeps them imposed on those coming <b>from</b> <b>country</b> J. These preferences create trade flows <b>from</b> <b>country</b> F to country H, displacing less efficient country H’s domestic production. However, it diverts trade from the more efficient country J to the less efficient country F. This is because the market price of imported goods <b>from</b> <b>country</b> F, which is now equivalent to P 3 [*]≡[*]SF, {{is lower than the}} market price of imported goods <b>from</b> <b>country</b> J, which remains at P 2 [*]≡[*]SJ(τ). Consequently, country H now produces the quantity [OQ 3] and imports the quantity [Q 3 Q 4] from the RTA member country F. The welfare analysis reveals that the RTA formation induces an increase in consumer surplus by the area [P 2 GNP 3]. However, there is a decrease in producer surplus by the area [P 2 CKP 3]. Also, tariff revenues, which were initially collected by <b>country</b> H’s government <b>from</b> imports coming <b>from</b> <b>country</b> J (i.e., the quantity [Q 1 Q 2]), are now lost. The loss in governmental tariff revenues is equivalent to the area [CGVU]. Summing up, the net effect on national welfare of <b>country</b> H <b>from</b> the RTA formation is equivalent to the area [(CKL[*]+[*]GMN)-LMVU]e.|$|R

The euro has most specifically stimulated investment in companies that come <b>from</b> <b>countries</b> that previously had weak currencies.

Whereas the Byzantine Empire centered in Greece and Anatolia maintained rare incidences of correspondence with the Tang, Song and Ming dynasties of China, the Roman papacy sent several missionaries and embassies to the early Mongol Empire as well as to Khanbaliq (modern Beijing), the capital of the Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty.|$|E
