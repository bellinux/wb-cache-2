This led to the discoveries that CardSystems had been keeping data in unencrypted form that it was contractually obligated to delete, and that its own network was vulnerable to <b>infiltration</b> <b>by</b> hackers. Visa and American Express subsequently dropped it as {{a credit card}} processing company. CardSystems was acquired by Pay By Touch. The buyout was completed on December 9, 2005.

40|$|Objective. Infiltration of {{rheumatoid}} arthritis (RA) synovial tissue (ST) by differentiated dendritic cells (DC) is a consistent feature {{in patients with}} active disease. However, mononuclear cells (MNC), including DC, may be nonspecifically chemoattracted to inflammatory sites regardless of etiology, Therefore, to evaluate the specificity of ST <b>infiltration</b> <b>by</b> differentiated DC, synovial biopsies from patients with RA, spondylarthropathy (SpA), osteoarthritis (OA), and gout were examined. Methods. Formalin-fixed ST sections were analyzed by double immunohistochemical staining for vascularity and <b>infiltration</b> <b>by</b> differentiated DC, lymphocytes, and macrophages. Results, DC containing nuclear RelB were found in perivascular MNC aggregates from patients with all arthritides studied. <b>Infiltration</b> <b>by</b> differentiated DC was similar in RA and SpA ST, but reduced in OA ST. Differentiated DC were always observed in close association with lymphocytes, and the correlation between these variables suggested that the infiltration of inflammatory sites by DC and lymphocytes was associated. Conclusion, Perivascular <b>infiltration</b> <b>by</b> DC, lymphocytes, and macrophages is nonspecifically related to inflammation, but signals present in RA and SpA ST lead to more intense cellular infiltration and accumulation...|$|R
