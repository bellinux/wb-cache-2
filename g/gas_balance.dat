50|$|The nexus {{created by}} the {{different}} views on impacts caused by industrial production is exemplified by several contributions to the discussion about producer or consumer responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions data are reported to the IPCC as contributions of producing industries located in a particular country rather than as embodiments in products consumed by a particular population, irrespective of productive origin. However, especially for open economies, {{taking into account the}} greenhouse gases embodied in internationally traded commodities can have a considerable influence on national greenhouse <b>gas</b> <b>balance</b> sheets. Assuming consumer responsibility, exports have to be subtracted from, and imports added to national greenhouse gas inventories. In Denmark, for example, Munksgaard and Pedersen (2001) report that a significant amount of power and other energy-intensive commodities are traded across Danish borders, and that between 1966 and 1994 the Danish foreign trade balance in terms of CO2 developed from a 7 Mt deficit to a 7 Mt surplus, compared to total emissions of approximately 60 Mt. In particular, electricity traded between Norway, Sweden and Denmark is subject to large annual fluctuations due to varying rainfall in Norway and Sweden. In wet years Denmark imports hydro-electricity whereas electricity from coal-fired power plants is exported in dry years. The official Danish emissions inventory includes a correction for electricity trade and thus applies the consumer responsibility principle.|$|E

SUBJECTS: Twenty-six adult female New Zealand white rabbits. INTERVENTION: Anesthesia and pneumoperitoneum. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In anesthetized rabbits arterial blood <b>gases,</b> acid-base <b>balance,</b> oxygenation values, and lactate concentrations were assayed during 2 hours. Spontaneous breathing, superficial and optimal ventilation without pneumoperitoneum, and with pneumoperitoneum at low (6 mm Hg) and higher (10 mm Hg) insufflation pressures were compared.

In their natural state, peatlands act as sinks of carbon dioxide, but sources of methane.

30|$|Results and Discussion For {{existing}} {{oil palm}} plantations, two main fields for possible optimisation can be identified: one is improving the plantation management, {{the other is}} increasing {{the efficiency of the}} utilisation of waste products such as fibres and husks or oil mill effluents. For newly-planned oil palm plantations alternative land use scenarios have to be considered. The results show a big potential for optimisation. Thus, the greenhouse <b>gas</b> <b>balance</b> improves slightly if plantations are run more efficiently. If the waste products are used to generate energy, there are significantly positive effects on the greenhouse <b>gas</b> <b>balance,</b> especially through the reduction of methane emissions. By running a plantation in a professional best-practice way, 4.8  t of greenhouse gases can be saved annually per hectare cultivation area, expressed as CO 2 equivalents. If newly-planned oil palm plantations are established on fallow land, greenhouse gas emissions can be further reduced by an additional 4.8  t of CO 2 equivalents per hectare and year. From an economic perspective, this may be more costly than clearing primary forest but it is advantageous for both the greenhouse <b>gas</b> <b>balance</b> and the biodiversity of the concerned areas. All in all, exploiting the whole potential for optimisation could result in the saving of 10.2  t CO 2 equivalents per hectare and year more than it is the case in the existing mode of cultivation.|$|E

The greenhouse <b>gas</b> <b>balance</b> was calculated by subtracting to the net carbon removal, the fossil carbon emissions and the additional emissions of carbon as CH 4. Two different approaches were applied for estimating the net carbon removal in the sector: the stock-change and the atmospheric-flow approach. The global greenhouse <b>gas</b> <b>balance</b> was a net removal of carbon that varied between 401 and 1033 Gg Ceq yr- 1, respectively with the stock-change and the atmospheric-flow approaches. The difference between the two estimates is equivalent to the carbon exported in wood and forest products. Both forest and forest products were carbon sinks, as their stocks have been increasing. About 94 % of the total change in carbon stocks in the sector was due to forest, whereas paper was the forest product with the major contribution to the increase of carbon stocks. Fossil carbon emissions accounted for 13 % of the total carbon emissions in the sector and decreased the net carbon removal by 18 and 34 %, respectively with the atmospheric-flow and the stock-change approaches.
