40|$|Do Financial {{accounting}} practices as per the political setup and their administrative strategies, pose problems to {{the pace of}} Socio-economic development of any nation ? This paper addresses this question with a preview to the dawn of human civilizations on earth, and mathematically cumulating the thoughts of Socio-economic development in four facets, from Individual to National level. Different Financial Management Techniques are used under the two divergent political setups, namely the Capitalism and the Communism. A capitalist setup provides the freedom of corporate control under each individual entrepreneur or a corporate unit (I), under private or government control (G), to function as an autonomous body. These units could function towards their self goals, using the "Return on Investment" as their motivating guideline. A communist setup represents a centralised approach through individual work contributions at micro level. Under this setup, the national demand is pre-assessed and fixed by the State. The financial management is taken care by the State Bank. These <b>financial</b> <b>overviews</b> lead {{to the conclusion that}} irrespective of the political setup, the Socio-economic development is a Three Dimensional Closed Cycle Economic process, namely Manpower, Materials and Techno-commercial infrastructure, in a preset Seven Sequential order. Of these, the Manpower is the Prime component. It should be supported by adequate Infrastructure Systems, and Performance Feed back. The Politico-Financial overview infers that the Cost and Quality of Domestic goods and services, decide the status of Socio-economic development. This directly depends upon the proper utilisation pattern of the three ingredients and the Productivity orientation of the Prime component (Manpower). The world experiences support the Closed Cycle Economic process. The inferences are supported with examples from Britain, Germany, India, Russia and USA. The matter is supported with 4 Creative and Comprehensive Schematic Diagrams summarising the Financial Approaches of Capitalist/Communist setup, Closed Cycle Economics and the Productivity relationship of the Prime component Manpower, respectively. This Research Paper is based on a study survey by the Author to various countries functioning under different Political and Financial accounting Appraisal Techniques.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this thesis was to obtain an {{understanding}} {{of the way in which}} accounting practices that are constantly in transition generate the information that is disclosed in corporate annual reports (CARS). The study shows that CARS may be seen as a product of two main interrelated information processing systems, the first being the mandatory financial information system (MFIS) and the second the discretionary information system (DIS). The MFIS uses accounting practices such as generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which include International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), International Accounting Standards (IASs), JSE regulations and the Companies' Act requirements, in producing the information disclosed in CARS. The needs of users to reduce the uncertainty and risks in their decision making have an influence on the constantly evolving accounting practices. Standard-setting bodies play a major role in the development and refinement of GAAP. On the other hand, the DIS, in order to provide a complete picture of business entities, uses discretionary accounting practices to produce the contextual information contained in CARS. These discretionary accounting practices are also currently in transition. They cater for the production of information on the business environment, and provide an operating and <b>financial</b> review, <b>overview</b> of strategy, forward-looking information, key performance indicators and information on corporate governance and transparency. Standard-setting bodies may be able to use the contextual information contained in CARS to develop and refine the GAAP used by the MFIS.

In 2008, three major revenue sources under performed when compared against projections; sales tax, permit revenue and gambling tax revenue. Collectively these three revenue sources finished the year $ 556, 110 below projections.

Although this is the case, as staff looks towards the remainder of 2008 we have started to see economic conditions negatively impacting some of the City’s primary operating revenue sources. Specific areas of concern are: • Gambling revenue down 14. 3 % from projections due to declining card room activity through March 2008. Card room gambling tax returns for April through June are not remitted to the City until July 30, 2008, but a review of those returns continue to show declining activity. • Interest revenue is 1. 2 % below projections due to falling interest rates.
