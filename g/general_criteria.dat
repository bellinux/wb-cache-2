5|$|By many <b>general</b> <b>criteria</b> {{of mutual}} intelligibility, the Continental Scandinavian {{languages}} {{could very well}} be considered dialects of a common Scandinavian language. However, because of several hundred years of sometimes quite intense rivalry between Denmark and Sweden, including a long series of wars from the 16th to 18th centuries, and the nationalist ideas that emerged during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the languages have separate orthographies, dictionaries, grammars, and regulatory bodies. Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish are thus from a linguistic perspective more accurately described as a dialect continuum of Scandinavian (North Germanic), and some of the dialects, such as those on the border between Norway and Sweden, especially parts of Bohuslän, Dalsland, western Värmland, western Dalarna, Härjedalen, Jämtland and Scania, could be described as intermediate dialects of the national standard languages.|$|E

500|$|All of Bundy's known {{victims were}} white females, most of middle-class backgrounds. Almost all {{were between the}} ages of 15 and 25 and most were college students. He {{apparently}} never approached anyone he might have met before. (In their last conversation before his execution, Bundy told Kloepfer he had purposely stayed away from her [...] "when he felt the power of his sickness building in him.") Rule noted that most of the identified victims had long straight hair, parted in the middle—like Stephanie Brooks, the woman who rejected him, and to whom he later became engaged and then rejected in return. Rule speculated that Bundy's animosity toward his first girlfriend triggered his protracted rampage and caused him to target victims who resembled her. Bundy dismissed this hypothesis: [...] "hey ... just fit the <b>general</b> <b>criteria</b> of being young and attractive", he told Hugh Aynesworth. [...] "Too many people have bought this crap that all the girls were similar ... almost everything was dissimilar ... physically, they were almost all different." [...] He did concede that youth and beauty were [...] "absolutely indispensable criteria" [...] in his choice of victims.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A <b>general</b> <b>criterion</b> for integer {{ambiguity}} searching {{is derived}} in this paper. The criterion {{takes into account}} not only the residuals caused by ambiguity parameter changing, but also the residuals caused by coordinates changing through ambiguity fixing. The search {{can be carried out}} in a coordinate domain, in an ambiguity domain or in both domains. The three searching scenarios are theoretically equivalent. The optimality and uniqueness properties of the proposed criterion are also discussed. A numerical explanation of the <b>general</b> <b>criterion</b> is outlined. The theoretical relationship between the <b>general</b> <b>criterion</b> and the commonly used least squares ambiguity search (LSAS) criterion is derived in an equivalent case in detail. It shows that the LSAS criterion {{is just one of the}} terms of the equivalent criterion. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the behaviour of the two components of the equivalent criterion...|$|R

This paper develops a new <b>general</b> <b>criterion</b> that determines whether these catastrophic events will occur. Primarily this is done {{in the context of the}} many car-following models described in the literature. The <b>general</b> <b>criterion</b> is shown to agree with the specific stability conditions of these models, including those in which drivers taken into account vehicles more than one ahead. As described in the literature, when the flow is stable, columns of vehicles are seen to smooth any perturbations to the flow. This enables the <b>general</b> <b>criterion</b> to be extended to include non-identical drivers. The stability criterion is also seen to agree with those established from continuum theory. Finally, the stability condition is considered with respect to data obtained from the M 25 in the U. K. ...|$|R

We first provide a <b>general</b> <b>criterion</b> that proves the symmetrizability of this model, which implies hyperbolicity and local well-posedness in H^s(R^ 2), with s> 2. Then, we analyze rigorously the eigenstructure associated to this model and prove a more <b>general</b> <b>criterion</b> of hyperbolicity and local well-posedness, under weak density-stratification assumption. Finally, we consider a new conservative two-layer shallow water model, prove the hyperbolicity and the local well-posedness and rely it to the basic two-layer shallow water model.
