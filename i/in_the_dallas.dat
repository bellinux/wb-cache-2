5|$|Dallas and Fort Worth {{experienced}} one {{of their}} greatest oil-related construction booms in 1930 and 1931, when {{the opening of the}} East Texas oil field helped establish Dallas as the financial center for the oil industry in Texas and Oklahoma.

50|$|As a {{response}} to the newly formed league and the presence of an AFL franchise <b>in</b> <b>Dallas,</b> <b>the</b> NFL quickly placed a new franchise of their own <b>in</b> <b>Dallas,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dallas</b> Cowboys.
