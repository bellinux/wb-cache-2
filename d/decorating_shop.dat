500|$|After {{his release}} from captivity in 1953, Misch {{returned}} to what was then West Berlin. He arrived home on New Year's Eve 1953 to the house which was [...] from the Führerbunker. At the time, Misch's wife worked as a teacher in Neukölln. Misch struggled for several years with {{what to do with}} his life after captivity. He was offered various odd jobs, among others as a porter in a hospital and as a driver. Most of these job offers were through his wartime contacts, and required moving away from Berlin, which his wife refused to do. He finally obtained a loan backed by wealthy German philanthropists to buy out a painting and interior <b>decorating</b> <b>shop</b> from a retiree in Berlin. He ran this modest business successfully, and during the early Allied occupation of Berlin also became involved in the making of peanut butter for American troops. The business had been started by Misch's old friend, Adolf Kleinholdermann. This sideline business became so successful that Misch considered leaving his shop. His wife convinced him to remain in the painting and interior decorating business. In 1975, Gerda was elected to the parliament of West Berlin in which she served for several years. Years later Gerda developed Alzheimer's and died in 1998. Misch continued to manage his shop until his retirement at age 68 in 1985.
