When Groening realized that animating Life in <b>Hell</b> <b>would</b> require the rescinding of publication rights for his life's work, he chose another approach and formulated his version of a dysfunctional family.|$|E

This work detailed the punishments that awaited sinners, and Osbert was accused of accepting gifts from both sides of lawsuits. Coggeshall did state that Osbert was [...] "most expert in worldly law" [...] and was famous for [...] "his overflowing eloquence and experience in the law". According to Coggeshall, Osbert's punishment in <b>Hell</b> <b>would</b> consist of having to swallow hot coins and then being forced to vomit the coins back up.

Richard Sakai contacted Groening to see if he had any other characters {{he would be willing to}} let Fox merchandise, and, in short, Groening developed a dysfunctional family that became the Simpsons. Garth Ancier contends that Groening created the characters at home and brought them the next day, while Phil Roman claims Groening sketched out the characters on the drive to Fox. Groening's account states he hurriedly formulated The Simpsons while waiting in the lobby of Brooks's office for the pitch meeting, which is the most common and famous story.

Bart was modeled after Groening's older brother, Mark, but given a different name which was chosen as an anagram of [...] "brat". The stories were written and storyboarded by Matt Groening. The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead they just traced over his drawings. The animation was produced domestically at Klasky Csupo, with Wesley Archer, David Silverman, and Bill Kopp being animators for the first season. After season one, it would be animated by Archer and Silverman thereafter. Gyorgyi Peluce was the colorist and the person who decided to make the characters yellow.|$|E
500|$|John Hick criticised the Augustinian theodicy when he {{developed}} his own theodicy in 1966. Hick supported {{the views of}} the German theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher, which he classified as Irenaean, who argued that the world is perfectly suited for the moral development of humans and that this justifies the existence of evil. He insisted that, while the Augustinian theodicy attempted to justify historical occurrences of evil, the Irenaean theodicy seeks to justify God eternally. Hick saw Augustine's view that a perfect world went wrong as incoherent and contradictory, and argued that, if humans were made perfectly good, then it should have been impossible for them to have made an immoral choice. He questioned the success of the theodicy with the charge that it does not remove the blame for evil from God: Augustine presented a theology of predestination; Hick argued that, if God knew the choices that his creation would make, he must be responsible for them. Hick's theodicy rejected the idea of the inheritance of sinfulness, and he believed that an eternal <b>hell</b> <b>would</b> render [...] "a Christian theodicy impossible". The Irenaean theodicy does not, as the Augustinian theodicy does, attempt to protect God from being responsible for evil; rather, it argues that God is responsible but justified for it because of the benefits it has for human development. Both theodicies stress the perfection of God's creation, but differ in why the world is seen as perfect. Augustine also believed, as Hick did, that bringing good out of evil is preferable to the evil not occurring in the first place.|$|E
500|$|Shin Megami Tensei If... was {{developed}} as a spin-off from the main series. Its smaller world scope came about because the game's director Kouji Okada felt he had reached the limit of {{what he could do}} with large-scale worlds in the previous Shin Megami Tensei games. The main concept was for a high school setting rendered in three dimensions where a portal to <b>hell</b> <b>would</b> open, creating a more self-contained adventure. The modelling for Karukozaka High School was based on pictures from writer Ryutaro Ito's school album as they had no other visual resources. The project's working title was Shin Megami Tensei X. The Partner system was divided into main and sub categories, with three to four playable characters available. The ability for sub characters to wield COMPs and need to be rescued was planned, but both were rejected. The Guardian system was designed by future Megami Tensei director Katsura Hashino. The game's music was written by Tsukasa Masuko. One of the game's main themes, the Karukozaka High School school song heard during the ending, had lyrics written by Ito, who based them on the lyrics of his own school's song. Masuko was unimpressed when Ito asked for the lyrics {{to be added to the}} song. While only one line is ever heard in-game, Ito created three lines. If... was completed in a very short span of time, so much so that in 2003 Okada later described the development time as being [...] "unthinkable" [...] for any developer.|$|E
