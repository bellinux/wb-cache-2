5|$|No Man <b>Knows</b> <b>My</b> History: The Life of Joseph Smith is a 1945 book by Fawn McKay Brodie, {{the first}} {{important}} non-hagiographic biography of Joseph Smith, {{the founder of}} Latter Day Saint movement. The book has not gone out of print, and 60 years after its first publication, its publisher, Alfred A. Knopf, continues to sell about a thousand copies annually. A revised edition appeared in 1971, and on the 50th anniversary of its first publication, Utah State University issued a volume of retrospective essays about the book, its author, and her methods.|$|E

500|$|Nevertheless, Brodie's {{book has}} been criticized by some scholars, most often for its {{speculative}} interpretations of early Mormon history and its presumptions about Smith's internal motivation. In reviewing No Man <b>Knows</b> <b>My</b> History, Vardis Fisher (himself a prolific novelist—and atheist—who remained unconvinced by Brodie’s theory of Smith's motivations) incorrectly speculated that Brodie would “turn novelist in her next book.” ...|$|E
500|$|In May 1946, the LDS Church excommunicated Brodie. She {{never tried}} to regain her membership. Brodie once wrote to a friend that what she {{suffered}} from her disillusionment with Mormonism [...] "had {{to do with the}} pain I caused my family. [...] The disillusionment itself was...a liberating experience." [...] Before No Man <b>Knows</b> <b>My</b> History was published, Brodie sought to comfort her parents, [...] "You brought us all up to revere the truth, which is the noblest ideal a parent can instill in his children, {{and the fact that we}} come out on somewhat different roads certainly is no reflection on you." [...] Brodie's mother and three sisters were enthusiastic about the book, but Thomas McKay refused to read it.|$|E

500|$|For [...] {{more than}} a quarter century Fawn Brodie's No Man <b>Knows</b> <b>My</b> History has been {{recognized}} by most professional American historians as the standard work on the life of Joseph Smith and perhaps the most important single work on early Mormonism. At the same time the work has had tremendous influence upon informed Mormon thinking, as shown by the fact that whole issues of B.Y.U. Studies and Dialogue have been devoted to considering questions on the life of the Mormon prophet raised by Brodie. There is evidence that her book has had strong negative impact on popular Mormon thought as well, since to this day in certain circles in Utah to acknowledge that one has [...] "read Fawn Brodie" [...] is to create doubts as to one's loyalty to the Church.|$|E
500|$|Its title, No Man <b>Knows</b> <b>My</b> History, {{alludes to}} a comment Joseph Smith {{made in a}} speech shortly before his {{assassination}} in 1844. [...] Brodie presents the young Joseph as a lazy, good-natured, extroverted, and unsuccessful treasure seeker. In an attempt to improve his family's fortunes, he developed the notion of golden plates and then {{the concept of a}} religious novel, the Book of Mormon. [...] It was based in part on View of the Hebrews, an earlier work by a contemporary clergyman Ethan Smith. Brodie asserts that at first Joseph Smith was a deliberate impostor; but at some point, in nearly untraceable steps, he became convinced that he was a prophet. She wrote that he never escaped [...] "the memory of the conscious artifice" [...] that created the Book of Mormon.|$|E

500|$|During her research, Brodie {{discovered}} {{primary sources}} {{that had previously}} been overlooked or neglected. She presented the young Joseph Smith as a good-natured, lazy, extroverted, and unsuccessful treasure seeker, who, in an attempt to improve his family's fortunes, first developed the notion of golden plates and then the concept of a religious novel, the Book of Mormon. This book, she claims, was based in part on an earlier work, View of the Hebrews, by a contemporary clergyman Ethan Smith. [...] Brodie asserts that at first Smith was a deliberate impostor, who at some point, in nearly untraceable steps, became convinced that he was indeed a prophet—though without ever escaping [...] "the memory of the conscious artifice" [...] that created the Book of Mormon. Jan Shipps, a preeminent non-LDS scholar of Mormonism, who rejects this theory, nevertheless has called No Man <b>Knows</b> <b>My</b> History a [...] "beautifully written biography...the work of a mature scholar [...] represented the first genuine effort {{to come to grips with}} the contradictory evidence about Smith's early life." ...|$|E
500|$|Although No Man <b>Knows</b> <b>My</b> History criticized many {{foundational}} Mormon {{beliefs about}} Joseph Smith, the LDS Church {{was slow to}} condemn the work, even as the book went into a second printing. [...] In 1946, The Improvement Era, an official periodical of the Church, said {{that many of the}} book's citations arose from doubtful sources and that the biography was [...] "of no interest to Latter-day Saints who have correct knowledge of the history of Joseph Smith." [...] The [...] "Church News" [...] section of the Deseret News had a lengthy critique: it praised the biography's [...] "fine literary style" [...] and denounced it as [...] "a composite of all anti-Mormon books that have gone before." [...] In the booklet, [...] "No, Ma'am, That's Not History", the BYU professor and LDS historian and apologist Hugh Nibley challenged Brodie. [...] He asserted that she had cited sources supportive only of her conclusions while conveniently ignoring others. Brodie described the Deseret News pamphlet as [...] "a well-written, clever piece of Mormon propaganda," [...] but she dismissed the more popular [...] "No, Ma'am, That's Not History" [...] as [...] "a flippant and shallow piece." ...|$|E

She had been cautioned about this trip beforehand due to the frequent insurgency activities in Central Luzon of the Hukbalahap, the military arm of the Communist Party of the Philippines. She shrugged off the threat, remarking on {{the morning of}} the trip, [...] " [...] Taruc <b>knows</b> <b>my</b> white hair and he will not hurt me."

2500|$|During a 1971 {{conference at}} Columbia University, a {{creative}} writing student asked Borges what he regarded as [...] "a writer's duty to his time". Borges replied, [...] "I think a writer's {{duty is to}} be a writer, and if he can be a good writer, he is doing his duty. Besides, I think of my own opinions as being superficial. For example, I am a Conservative, I hate the Communists, I hate the Nazis, I hate the anti-Semites, and so on; but I don't allow these opinions to find their way into my writings—except, of course, when I was greatly elated about the Six Days' War. Generally speaking, I think of keeping them in watertight compartments. Everybody <b>knows</b> <b>my</b> opinions, but as for my dreams and my stories, they should be allowed their full freedom, I think. I don't want to intrude into them, I'm writing fiction, not fables." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nibley {{also wrote}} about LDS Temples, the {{historical}} Enoch, similarities between Christian Gnostic and Latter-day Saint beliefs, {{and what he}} believed to be anti-Mormon works.

He wrote many scholarly articles, including a widely referenced study of the Roman sparsiones. His Berkeley dissertation was on Roman Festival Games. He has been published in Classical Journal, Western Political Quarterly, Western Speech, Jewish Quarterly Review, Church History, Revue de Qumran, Vigililae Christianae, The Historian, The American Political Science Review, and the Encyclopaedia Judaica. Possibly his most contentious essay was [...] "The Passing of the Church: Forty Variations on an Unpopular Theme," [...] from 1961. He shifted from scholarly to LDS publications in the mid-sixties.
