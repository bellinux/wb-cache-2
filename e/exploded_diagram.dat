Williams describes the album as [...] "a treat {{from start to}} finish" [...] offering [...] "an innocent optimism that will always be worth a listen". New Zealand Herald critic Graham Reid considers [...] "Dream Scene" [...] to be [...] "by far the most psychedelic and out-there piece by any Beatle to that time", adding that [...] "towards the end you can almost anticipate Lennon's Revolution 9 coming in." [...] Reid describes the album as, variously, [...] "peculiar and terrific" [...] and [...] "one {{of the most interesting}} and courageously different of [...] solo albums".|$|E

50|$|<b>Exploded</b> <b>diagrams</b> {{are common}} in {{descriptive}} manuals showing parts placement, or parts contained in an assembly or sub-assembly. Usually such diagrams have the part identification number and a label indicating which part fills the particular position in the diagram. Many spreadsheet applications can automatically create <b>exploded</b> <b>diagrams,</b> such as <b>exploded</b> pie charts.|$|R

The design and operation of the Dynavector system (with positive displacement very-low-inertia nonrotating vane motor) are reviewed. Feasibility studies, contract data, and findings of braking tests are described. <b>Exploded</b> <b>diagrams</b> of Dynavector details are displayed. Success in using powered wheels in lieu of aircraft main engines for on-ground movements should bring benefits in energy conservation, noise abatement, reduced pollution, and alleviated congestion in the terminal area...|$|R

50|$|An exploded-view {{drawing is}} a {{technical}} drawing {{of an object}} that shows the relationship or order of assembly of the various parts. It shows the components of an object slightly separated by distance or suspended in surrounding space {{in the case of}} a three-dimensional <b>exploded</b> <b>diagram.</b> An object is represented as if there had been a small controlled explosion emanating from the middle of the object, causing the object's parts to be separated relative distances away from their original locations.|$|E
50|$|An <b>exploded</b> view <b>diagram</b> shows {{component}} parts dis-assembled in some way, {{so that each}} {{can be seen on}} its own. These views are common in technical manuals, but are also used in architecture, either in conceptual diagrams or to illustrate technical details. In a cutaway view parts of the exterior are omitted to show the interior, or details of internal construction. Although common in technical illustration, including many building products and systems, the cutaway is in fact little-used in architectural drawing.|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{embedding}} of {{diamond dust}} onto a polyethylene-coated Al plate {{has been used}} to make a blocking filter for FIR applications. The Al plate is sandwiched between two Mylar 'blankets' and the air between the layers is removed by means of a small vacuum pump. After the polyethylene is heated and softened, the diamond dust is applied to the polyethylene coating using a brush. The optimum diamond dust grain sizes corresponding to polyethylene layer thicknesses of 9 - 12 microns are given in a table, and the application of the blocking filter to spectrometric measurements in the FIR is described. An <b>exploded</b> view <b>diagram</b> of the layered structure of the blocking filter is provided...|$|R
5000|$|Seattle Weekly News said this: [...] "The {{journals}} {{are like}} an <b>exploded</b> <b>diagram</b> of a tormented soul, a maelstrom of self-pity, intolerant pride, morbid introspection, ingenious self-delusion, merciless self-knowledge, showbiz revulsion, starstruck effusion, Faustian ambition, otherworldly detachment, and an iron will helpless to help itself. Packed into 280 pages are shocking confessions, sweetly eloquent letters to brilliant friends, hard-nosed band plans, fulminating political screeds, obscene cartoons, haunting video treatments, and lyrical poetry of tremulous Romantic sensitivity, Bukowskian crudity, dadaist flippancy, and modernist opacity."

50|$|The {{first of}} the famous Soviet {{airliner}} series to appear, in 1963, was the Tupolev Tu-104, the first medium haul jet aircraft to go into regular sustained airline service. The early Plasticart Tu-104 {{set the standard for}} all the kits that followed. It was scaled at 1:100 which whilst not common for aircraft kits at the time, was close to FROG models' 1:96 scale and matched well with contemporary East German TT trains such as Berliner Bahn. In addition, the kit set a standard for being simple to assemble, with a minimal number of parts, sturdy landing gear and a full decal sheet. Instructions were a let-down though - often printed in German, Russian, Polish and Czech, these were aimed squarely at consumers in the Comecon countries, were Plasticart kits were both affordable and plentiful. There was an <b>exploded</b> <b>diagram,</b> but no English instructions.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} study investigated how an individual 2 ̆ 7 s mental rotation ability can affect {{his or her}} performance in manual assembly operations and whether different kinds of work instructions can enhance an individual 2 ̆ 7 s mental rotation activities during the course. The study also examined the fitness of a proposed cognitive model for manual assembly operations {{and the effectiveness of}} resulting work instructions. The participants were asked to perform assembly tasks of a one-cylinder, four-cycle small engine according to the work instruction provided. The work instruction treatment consisted of product assembly information {{in the form of an}} <b>exploded</b> <b>diagram,</b> step-by-step procedures, or an animated video. Through the participant following the on screen work instructions and assembling three dimensional parts in a computer simulation environment, the tactile information through contacting the product was reduced to the minimum and thus the performing of mental rotation activities was enforced. ^ The experiment design for this study was a two-by-three factorial design, where there are two levels of individual mental rotation ability and three levels of treatments. Vandenburg 2 ̆ 7 s Mental Rotation Test was used as a pretest instrument to differentiate the participants 2 ̆ 7 spatial ability. A treatment of work instructions then was assigned randomly to each participant to assemble the given products accordingly. The performance of participants was measured through a compounded Performance Index; both the speed and accuracy were measured. Participants in the study were undergraduate students from several academic majors in the engineering and technology fields and primarily first and second year student. ^ Results of the study showed main effects and interaction between two independent variables. Nevertheless, only the performance difference between two MRT groups was significant. There was no evidence of significant performance difference between different work instruction treatment groups. Less than one third of participants favored the work instructions provided, which might directly affect the learning outcomes of the remaining participants. More participants preferred having step-by-step procedural work instructions than the other two; around one third of participants preferred a combination of all three presentation strategies. ...|$|E
