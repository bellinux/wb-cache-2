5|$|The <b>diagnostic</b> <b>criteria</b> for SCSFLS {{is based}} on the 2004 International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edn (ICHD-II) (Table 1) (50) criteria. However, the {{presentation}} of patients with confirmed diagnosis may be very {{different from that of the}} clinical <b>diagnostic</b> <b>criteria</b> and cannot be considered authoritative.|$|E
5|$|Standard <b>diagnostic</b> <b>criteria</b> require {{impairment}} in social interaction and repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, activities and interests, without significant delay in language or cognitive development. Unlike the international standard, the DSM-IV-TR criteria also required significant {{impairment in}} day-to-day functioning; DSM-5 eliminated AS {{as a separate}} diagnosis in 2013, and folded it into the umbrella of autism spectrum disorders. Other sets of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>criteria</b> have been proposed by Szatmari et al. and by Gillberg and Gillberg.|$|E
5|$|A {{task force}} of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society (MDS) has {{proposed}} <b>diagnostic</b> <b>criteria</b> for Parkinson’s disease as well as research criteria for the diagnosis of prodromal disease, but these will require validation against the more established criteria.|$|E

5|$|As Ukrainian {{psychiatrist}} Ada Korotenko notes, {{the use of}} punitive psychiatry allowed {{of avoiding}} the judicial procedure during which the accused might declare the impossibility to speak publicly and the violation of their civil rights. Making a psychiatric diagnosis is insecure and can {{be based on a}} preconception. Moreover, while diagnosing mental illness, subjective fuzzy <b>diagnostic</b> <b>criteria</b> are involved as arguments. The lack of clear <b>diagnostic</b> <b>criteria</b> and clearly defined standards of diagnostics contributes to applying punitive psychiatry to vigorous and gifted citizens who disagree with authorities. At the same time, most psychiatrists incline to believe that such a misdiagnosis is less dangerous than not diagnosing mental illness.|$|E
5|$|The {{constellation}} of anomalies seen with Nasodigitoacoustic syndrome {{result in a}} distinct diagnosis. The <b>diagnostic</b> <b>criteria</b> for the disorder are broad distal phalanges of the thumbs and big toes, accompanied by a broad and shortened nose, sensorineural hearing loss and developmental delay, with predominant occurrence in males.|$|E
5|$|Assessment of {{intellectual}} functioning including memory testing can further characterise {{the state of}} the disease. Medical organisations have created <b>diagnostic</b> <b>criteria</b> to ease and standardise the diagnostic process for practising physicians. The diagnosis can be confirmed with very high accuracy post-mortem when brain material is available and can be examined histologically.|$|E

50|$|One <b>diagnostic</b> <b>criterion</b> of narcissistic {{personality}} disorder {{is a lack}} of empathy and an unwillingness or inability to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others.|$|R
5|$|Autism is a neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} impaired social interaction, impaired verbal and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice {{signs in the}} first two years of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress. The <b>diagnostic</b> <b>criteria</b> require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three.|$|E
5|$|Many {{children}} with AS are initially misdiagnosed with {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD). Diagnosing adults is more challenging, as standard <b>diagnostic</b> <b>criteria</b> are designed for children and the expression of AS changes with age. Adult diagnosis requires painstaking clinical examination and thorough medical history gained from both the individual and other people who know the person, focusing on childhood behavior.|$|E
5|$|No {{single test}} has {{adequate}} {{sensitivity and specificity}} to diagnose pelvic inflammatory disease. A large multisite U.S. study found that cervical motion tenderness as a minimum clinical criterion increases {{the sensitivity of the}} CDC <b>diagnostic</b> <b>criteria</b> from 83 percent to 95 percent. However, even the modified 2002 CDC criteria do not identify women with subclinical disease.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{work out}} a {{qualitative}} <b>diagnostic</b> <b>criterion</b> for basic syndromes of traditional Chinese medicine in patients with primary liver cancer. Methods: Based on the collection and analysis of related medical literature, clinical investigation, and experts’ discussion, a preliminary qualitative <b>diagnostic</b> <b>criterion</b> for basic syndromes of traditional Chinese medicine in patients with primary liver cancer was formulated. Then it was used in clinic to be verified and revised repeatedly till it was improved to be a satisfied formal criterion. Results: The basic syndromes listed in the qualitative <b>diagnostic</b> <b>criterion</b> for basic syndromes in patients with primary liver cancer consisted of two parts: excessive syndromes, including the syndromes of stagnation of qi, blood stasis, excess-heat and dampness, and deficient syndromes, including the syndromes of deficiency of qi, deficiency of blood, deficiency of yin and deficiency of yang. Each of the above syndromes could be diagnosed according to specific combination of its corresponding symptoms or signs. The clinical verification {{results showed that the}} total matching ratio was 73. 92 % between the diagnoses made according to the criterion and the diagnoses acquired from the experts’ experience. Conclusions: The qualitative <b>diagnostic</b> <b>criterion</b> for basic syndromes of traditional Chinese medicine in patients with primary liver cancer is coincident with the experts’ clinical practice. However, it needs to be further studied...|$|R

5|$|He was {{particularly}} interested in dementia praecox (which he favored renaming schizophrenia), and found diffuse anatomic differences in the brains of schizophrenic patients. These changes were ignored or dismissed as artifactual by other investigators for several decades. Serious attention to Southard's findings did not reemerge in the medical literature until the 1990s, but changes in <b>diagnostic</b> <b>criteria</b> complicate the application of Southard's findings to modern schizophrenic patients. Shortly before his death Southard wrote and presented Non-dementia non-praecox: note on the advantages to mental hygiene of extirpating a term, but did not live to see it published.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association {{released}} the fifth {{edition of the}} DSM (DSM-5). To be diagnosed with schizophrenia, two <b>diagnostic</b> <b>criteria</b> have to be met {{over much of the}} time of a period of at least one month, with a significant impact on social or occupational functioning for at least six months. The person had to be suffering from delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. A second symptom could be negative symptoms, or severely disorganized or catatonic behaviour. The definition of schizophrenia remained essentially the same as that specified by the 2000 version of DSM (DSM-IV-TR), but DSM-5 makes a number of changes.|$|E
25|$|The new {{criterion}} {{is not a}} <b>diagnostic</b> <b>criterion</b> but {{a classification}} criterion to identify disease with a high likelihood of developing a chronic form. However a score of 6 or greater unequivocally classifies {{a person with a}} diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.|$|R

5|$|There is no {{laboratory}} test for serotonin syndrome. Therefore, diagnosis is by symptom observation and {{investigation of the}} patient's history. Several <b>diagnostic</b> <b>criteria</b> have been proposed. The first rigorously evaluated criteria were introduced in 1991 by Harvey Sternbach, a {{professor of psychiatry at}} UCLA. Researchers in Australia later developed the Hunter Toxicity Criteria Decision Rules, which have better sensitivity and specificity, 84% and 97%, respectively, when compared with the gold standard of diagnosis by a medical toxicologist. As of 2007, Sternbach's criteria were still the most commonly used.|$|E
5|$|Lorna Wing popularized {{the term}} Asperger {{syndrome}} in the English-speaking medical community in her 1981 {{publication of a}} series of case studies of children showing similar symptoms, and Uta Frith translated Asperger's paper to English in 1991. Sets of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>criteria</b> were outlined by Gillberg and Gillberg in 1989 and by Szatmari et al. in the same year. AS became a standard diagnosis in 1992, when it was included in the tenth edition of the World Health Organization's diagnostic manual, International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10); in 1994, it was added to the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic reference, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).|$|E
5|$|Medical {{organizations}} have created <b>diagnostic</b> <b>criteria</b> to ease and standardize the diagnostic process, {{especially in the}} early stages of the disease. The most widely known criteria come from the UK Queen Square Brain Bank for Neurological Disorders and the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. The Queen Square Brain Bank criteria require slowness of movement (bradykinesia) plus either rigidity, resting tremor, or postural instability. Other possible causes of these symptoms need to be ruled out. Finally, three or more of the following supportive features are required during onset or evolution: unilateral onset, tremor at rest, progression in time, asymmetry of motor symptoms, response to levodopa for at least five years, clinical course of at least ten years and appearance of dyskinesias induced by the intake of excessive levodopa.|$|E

5000|$|By blood film, one <b>diagnostic</b> <b>criterion</b> for {{infectious}} mononucleosis {{is the presence}} of 50% lymphocytes with at least 10% atypical lymphocytes (large, irregular nuclei), while the person also has fever, pharyngitis, and swollen lymph nodes. The atypical lymphocytes resembled monocytes when they were first discovered, thus the term [...] "mononucleosis" [...] was coined.|$|R
50|$|ACTH {{stimulation}} test - Confirmation requires {{evaluation of}} an ACTH stimulation test. Basline plasma cortisol and urine cortisol/Cr ratios are unreliable for confirming the diagnosis. One major <b>diagnostic</b> <b>criterion</b> is abnormally decreased post-ACTH plasma cortisol. Normal plasma cortisol after ACTH stimulation rules out adrenal insufficiency. The only accurate test for hypoadrenocorticism is an ACTH stimulation test.|$|R
5|$|Non-genetic, environmental, post-infectious, or psychosocial factors—while not causing Tourette's—can {{influence}} its severity. Autoimmune processes {{may affect}} tic onset and exacerbation in some cases. In 1998, a {{team at the}} US National Institute of Mental Health proposed a hypothesis based on observation of 50 children that both obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and tic disorders may arise in a subset of children {{as a result of}} a poststreptococcal autoimmune process. Children who meet five <b>diagnostic</b> <b>criteria</b> are classified, according to the hypothesis, as having Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections (PANDAS). This contentious hypothesis is the focus of clinical and laboratory research, but remains unproven.|$|E
5|$|Eighty {{percent of}} self-harm {{involves}} stabbing or cutting the skin {{with a sharp}} object. However, the number of self-harm methods are only limited by an individual's inventiveness and their determination to harm themselves; this includes burning, self-poisoning, alcohol abuse, self-embedding of objects, hair pulling, bruising/hitting one's self, scratching to hurt one's self, knowingly abusing over the counter or prescription drugs, and forms of self-harm related to anorexia and bulimia. The locations of self-harm are often areas {{of the body that}} are easily hidden and concealed from the detection of others. As well as defining self-harm in terms of the act of damaging the body, it may be more accurate to define self-harm in terms of the intent, and the emotional distress that the person is attempting to deal with. Neither the DSM-IV-TR nor the ICD-10 provide <b>diagnostic</b> <b>criteria</b> for self-harm. It is often seen as only a symptom of an underlying disorder, though many people who self-harm would like this to be addressed.|$|E
5|$|Frequency {{estimates}} vary enormously. In 2015 it {{was estimated}} that 37.2 million people globally are affected. A 2003 review of epidemiological studies of children found autism rates ranging from 0.03 to 4.84 per 1,000, with the ratio of autism to Asperger syndrome ranging from 1.5:1 to 16:1; combining the geometric mean ratio of 5:1 with a conservative prevalence estimate for autism of 1.3 per 1,000 suggests indirectly that the prevalence of AS might be around 0.26 per 1,000. Part of the variance in estimates arises from differences in <b>diagnostic</b> <b>criteria.</b> For example, a relatively small 2007 study of 5,484 eight-year-old children in Finland found 2.9 children per 1,000 met the ICD-10 criteria for an AS diagnosis, 2.7 per 1,000 for Gillberg and Gillberg criteria, 2.5 for DSM-IV, 1.6 for Szatmari et al., and 4.3 per 1,000 for the union of the four criteria. Boys seem to be more likely to have AS than girls; estimates of the sex ratio range from 1.6:1 to 4:1, using the Gillberg and Gillberg criteria. Females with autism spectrum disorders may be underdiagnosed.|$|E
