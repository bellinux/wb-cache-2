Large structural deflections under nominal loads and flight conditions, point out that a linear structural model is often inadequate in the accurate flutter prediction. In place of a linear Euler-Bernoulli theory, usually sufficient {{in the evaluation of}} natural frequencies of slender structures when deflections are lower than transversal dimensions, a nonlinear analysis is required as there is strong dependency between natural frequencies and beam deflections which could lead to flutter instability at lower flight speeds.

Rotor control in autorotation for teetering and articulated hub types is examined in more detail for a compound helicopter (rotor and fixed wing) using the comprehensive analysis CAMRAD II. Autorotation {{is found to be}} possible at two distinct trim conditions with different sharing of lift between the rotor and wing. Stability predictions obtained using the analytical rigid flapping blade analysis and a rigid blade CAMRAD II model compare favorably. For the flapping blade analysis, the teetering rotor is found to be the most stable hub type, showing no instabilities up to an advance ratio of 3 and a Lock number of 18.

The main problem of the technology relating to the manufacturing of heavy duty machine components using metal powders is associated with the difficulty to obtain sufficiently high, homogeneously distributed densities across the product volume. The tests were carried out using a test stand allowing the deformation under uniaxial compression combined with torsion. The sintered test specimens were made from the NC 100. 24 iron powder.

The wing had an aspect ratio of 1. 5 based on the wing semispan and an NACA 64 A 010 airfoil shape. The flutter boundary of the model was determined for a Mach number range of 0. 5 to 0. 97. The shape of the transonic flutter boundary was determined. Actual flutter points were obtained on both the subsonic and supersonic sides of the flutter bucket. The model exhibited a deep transonic flutter bucket over a narrow range of Mach number. At some Mach numbers, the flutter conditions were extrapolated using a subcritical response technique.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the influence of}} parametric variation in individual rotor/wing design variables on whirl flutter stability improvements of a soft in-plane tiltrotor. This {{is followed by the}} use of formal gradient-based design optimization. The simulations are based on a full-scale soft in-plane Boeing model 222 rotor on a semispan wing. For this baseline configuration, the flatwise flexibility and chordwise flexibility are both outboard of the pitch bearing and produce destabilizing pitch-flap and pitch-lag couplings. The most influential rotor parameter in improving flutter stability characteristics is the distribution of flatwise flexibility vis-à-vis the pitch bearing, and large improvements are observed when flatwise flexibility is moved inboard. However, this can result in a large increase in lag frequency and turn the design into a stiff in-plane configuration. Using frequency constraints during optimization of rotor parameters and carefully selecting the airspeed range over which optimization is conducted results in improvement in subcritical wing mode damping and increase in critical flutter speed. Other rotor parameters changes that have some benefit are reduction in overall chordwise stiffness, positive increase in pitch-flap and pitch-lag coupling, and increase in control system stiffness. Wing design parameters are unable to increase the critical flutter speed but can improve the subcritical damping, primarily through an increase in wing <b>torsion</b> <b>frequency</b> and a simultaneous reduction in wing beam mode frequency. Optimization using a combination of rotor/wing design parameters yields a 35 kt increase in whirl flutter speed (from 390 to 425 kt) and an increase in subcritical damping from less than 1 % t...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an analytical and experimental {{study to determine}} the mechanical characteristics of the pump mounting, bell housing type. For numerical purposes, the mount was modelled as a thin circular cylindrical shell with cutouts, stiffened with rings and stringers; the boundary conditions {{were considered to be}} either clamped-free or clamped-supporting rigid heavy mass. The theoretical study was concerned with both the static response and the free vibration characteristics of the mount. The approach was based on the Rayleigh-Ritz approximation technique using beam characteristic (axial) and trigonometric (Circumferential) functions in the displacement series, in association with the Love - Timoshenko thin shell theory. Studies were carried out to determine the effect of the supported heavy mass on the static response, frequencies and mode shapes; in addition, the effects of stringers, rings and cutouts on vibration characteristics were investigated. The static and dynamic formulations were both implemented on the Hewlett Packard 9845 computer. The experimental study was conducted to evaluate the results of the natural frequencies and mode shapes, predicted numerically. In the experimental part, a digital computer was used as an experiment controller, which allowed accurate and quick results. The following observations were made: 1. Good agreements were obtained with the results of other investigators. 2. Satisfactory agreement was achieved between the theoretical and experimental results. 3. Rings coupled the axial modal functions of the plain cylinder and tended to increase frequencies, except for the <b>torsion</b> modes where <b>frequencies</b> were reduced. Stringers coupled the circumferential modal functions and tended to decrease frequencies. The effect of rings was stronger than that of stringers. 4. Cutouts tended to reduce frequencies; in general, but this depends on the location of the cutouts; if they are near the free edge then an increase in frequencies is obtained. Cutouts coupled both axial and circumferential modal functions. 5.

Comparison of the lean-on and lean-off seating posture shows that the occupied seat in lean-off posture seat do not show significant structural resonant frequency changes from its corresponding unoccupied seat. This indicates that the interaction of the human body trunk and the seatback is relatively significant for the transmission of the vibration to the human body...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} {{behavior of}} spinning laminated composite pretwisted plates (turbo-fan blade-like) with small (less than 10 % by volume) integral viscoelastic damping patches was investigated at NASA-Lewis Research Center. Ten different plate sets were experimentally spin tested {{and the resulting}} data was analyzed. The first-four plate sets investigated tailoring patch locations and definitions to damp specific modes on spinning flat graphite/epoxy plates {{as a function of}} rotational speed. The remaining six plate sets investigated damping patch size and location on specific modes of pretwisted (30 degrees) graphite/epoxy plates. The results reveal that: (1) significant amount of damping can be added using a small amount of damping material, (2) the damped plates experienced no failures up to the tested 28, 000 g's and 750, 000 cycles, (3) centrifugal loads caused an increase in bending frequencies and corresponding reductions in bending damping levels that are proportional to the bending stiffness increase, and (4) the centrifugal loads caused a decrease in <b>torsion</b> natural <b>frequency</b> and increase in damping levels of pretwisted composite plates...|$|R
