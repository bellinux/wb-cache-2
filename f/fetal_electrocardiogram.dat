40|$|Abstract- Fetal ECG is an {{important}} parameter in medical field. <b>Fetal</b> <b>Electrocardiogram</b> (FECG) identifies the congenital heart problems at the earlier stage. <b>Fetal</b> <b>Electrocardiogram</b> (FECG) signal is extracted from blood pressure mother‟s abdomen. FECG signal is recorded at the thoracic and abdominal area of blood pressure mother‟s skin. The thoracic ECG {{is considered to be}} completely maternal ECG (MECG) of blood pressure mother. The abdominal ECG {{is considered to be a}} combination of blood pressure mother‟s ECG signals and foetus‟s ECG signals and random noise. The maternal component of abdominal ECG is a nonlinear transformed version of the Maternal ECG. The method Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is used to identify the nonlinear transformation of maternal ECG. For identifying the nonlinear transformation and the FECG is extracted by subtracting the non linear version of the MECG signal from the abdominal ECG signal. ANFIS is trained with particle swarm optimization for better quality of signal. This method can be validated on both real and synthetic ECG signals.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} a new method for extracting the fetal heart rate (fHR) and the fetal {{heart rate variability}} (fHRV) signal non-invasively using abdominal maternal electrocardiogram (mECG) recordings. The extraction {{is based on the}} fundamental frequency (Fourier’s) theorem. The fundamental frequency of the mother’s electrocardiogram signal (fo-m) is calculated directly from the abdominal signal. The heart rate of the fetus is usually higher than that of the mother; as a result, the fundamental frequency of the <b>fetal’s</b> <b>electrocardiogram</b> signal (fo-f) is higher than that of the mother’s (fo-f> fo-m). Notch filters to suppress mother’s higher harmonics were designed; then a bandpass filter to target fo-f and reject fo-m is implemented. Although the bandpass filter will pass some other frequencies (harmonics), we have shown in this study that those harmonics are actually carried on fo-f, and thus have no impact on the evaluation of the beat-to-beat changes (RR intervals). The oscillations of the time-domain extracted signal represent the RR intervals. We have also shown in this study that zero-to-zero evaluation of the periods is more accurate than the peak-to-peak evaluation. This method is evaluated both on simulated signals and on different abdominal recordings obtained at different gestational ages.

TE further increased from mid to late, for the fetuses with RMSSD of fetal heart rate being larger than 4 msec in the late gestation.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{pre-existing}} {{compression of}} the left ventricle in congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) could be aggravated by the amplified lung growth after fetoscopic endoluminal tracheal occlusion (FETO). Our aim was to document left ventricular (LV) size and function in fetuses with isolated left-sided CDH and to document the effect of FETO on the fetal heart. METHODS: We determined cardiac axis, LV diameters, ejection fraction, shortening fraction, mitral E/A index and myocardial performance index (MPI) in 27 fetuses with isolated left-sided CDH, and compared these with values in a reference population (n = 117). In fetuses with severe CDH that subsequently underwent FETO and/or reversal of occlusion, additional measurements were obtained 24 h before and after each fetal intervention. We recorded <b>fetal</b> <b>electrocardiograms</b> non-invasively in six CDH fetuses and compared {{the duration of the}} QRS complex with data obtained from 12 controls. RESULTS: LV end-diastolic diameter was 32 % smaller in CDH fetuses than in controls (P < 0. 0001) but LV function was comparable. QRS duration was no different between CDH and control fetuses. FETO did not affect cardiac size but reduced the MPI (P = 0. 004). Reversal of FETO had no significant effect on cardiac size and function. CONCLUSIONS: CDH fetuses have a smaller left ventricle than do healthy fetuses. There is no overall adverse impact of CDH and FETO on LV cardiac function. Copyright (c) 2009 ISUOG.

40|$|Non-invasive <b>fetal</b> <b>electrocardiograms</b> (FECGs) are an {{alternative}} method to standard means of fetal monitoring which permit long-term continual monitoring. However, in abdominal recording, the FECG amplitude is {{weak in the}} temporal domain and overlaps with the maternal electrocardiogram (MECG) in the spectral domain. Research {{in the area of}} non-invasive separations of FECG from abdominal electrocardiograms (AECGs) is in its infancy and several studies are currently focusing on this area. An adaptive noise canceller (ANC) is commonly used for cancelling interference in cases where the reference signal only correlates with an interference signal, and not with a signal of interest. However, results from some existing studies suggest that propagation of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals from the maternal heart to the abdomen is nonlinear, hence the adaptive filter approach may fail if the thoracic and abdominal MECG lack strict waveform similarity. In this study, singular value decomposition (SVD) and smooth window (SW) techniques are combined to build a reference signal in an ANC. This is to avoid the limitation that thoracic MECGs recorded separately must be similar to abdominal MECGs in waveform. Validation of the proposed method with r 01 and r 07 signals from a public dataset, and a self-recorded private dataset showed that the proposed method achieved F 1 scores of 99. 61 %, 99. 28 % and 98. 58 %, respectively for the detection of fetal QRS. Compared with four other single-channel methods, the proposed method also achieved higher accuracy values of 99. 22 %, 98. 57 % and 97. 21 %, respectively.

The {{purpose of this study}} in fetal sheep was to assess the feasibility of a minimally invasive fetoscopic approach for fetal transesophageal electrocardiography and stimulation aimed at diagnosis and termination of these tachycardias. Methods and Results —We studied a total of 10 fetal sheep (87 to 103 days of gestation; term 5145 days). We entered the amniotic cavity using a percutaneous fetoscopic approach and placed various electrophysiology catheters into the fetal esophagus. We recorded the number of animals in which fetoscopic transesophageal electrocardiography and stimulation were successful and assessed pacing success and thresholds for different catheters. In addition, we monitored for potential adverse effects from stimulation and for other complications of the operation. Recording of transesophageal electrocardiograms was successful in all fetal sheep. Capture during stimulation was successfully documented by additional <b>fetal</b> bipolar surface <b>electrocardiograms</b> in 7 fetuses. In fetuses in which <b>fetal</b> surface <b>electrocardiograms</b> were not recorded, pacing stimulus artifacts interfered with documentation of capture. Although stimulation thresholds were high, the maternal rhythm was not affected by fetal stimulation.

Different indirect methods to extract the <b>Fetal</b> <b>Electrocardiogram</b> (FECG) signal from an ECG recorded on the mother’s abdomen have been proposed.

With timely diagnosis perinatal pathology, birth injuries, antenatal stillbirths and newborn perinatal death can be prevented. At the moment in the world there are no complexes which enable monitoring of the fetus without any risk to his health. So the main aim of this work is development of hardware and software system to assess the functional status of the mother and fetus by {{the analysis of the}} signals recorded from the abdominal electrodes. Objectives: 1)  to formulate the requirements to noninvasive monitoring system and functional state assessment of mother and fetus. 2)  to develop algorithms and software for monitoring system and functional state assessment of mother and fetus. 3)  to determine fetus functional state at 32 – 33 week in women with uncomplicated pregnancies and in women with placental insufficiency in the compensation stage and subcompensation. The system concept is based on fetal heart rate recognition and analysis. Fetal heart rate has been extracted from the mixed signals received from abdominal electrodes. This technique is passive for a body so there is no research time limit. Device for simultaneous registration of <b>fetal</b> and maternal <b>electrocardiogram</b> is high sensitive bioamplifier with low level of intrinsic noises, high input resistance and suppression of inphase noises more than 80 DB.

40|$|Background. Congenital {{atrioventricular}} block (CHB) is {{the most}} frequent manifestation of neonatal lupus which is attributed to anti-Ro/SSA and/or anti-La/SSB-mediated inflammation and subsequent fibrosis of the atrioventricular node. Despite the observation of a direct role for maternal antibodies in inducing CHB both in vitro and in vivo studies, the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Currently no therapy {{is found to be}} effective in the treatment of 2 nd and 3 rd degree CHB induced by maternal antibodies; also because the rarity of the disease does not allow for controlled clinical trials. Objectives. To explore the role of anti-Ro 52 antibodies in the pathogenesis of CHB by identifying of the epitope specificity of anti-p 200 antibodies. To study in an animal model the effect on heart conduction system of the different doses of injected human IgG antibodies from a CHB patient. To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of a combined therapy protocol utilizing plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and betamethasone and the effect of this treatment on anti-Ro 52, anti-p 200 and anti-La antibody levels. Materials and Methods. Laboratory methods: ELISA assay, circular dichroism spectroscopy and antibody purification. Procedure: antibody transfer by intra-peritoneally injection of purified IgG. Instrumental methods: <b>fetal</b> ecocardiography and <b>electrocardiogram</b> recordings. Treatment strategy: Six consecutive women diagnosed CHB underwent a combination therapy protocol composed of weekly plasmapheresis, fortnightly 1 g/Kg IVIG and daily Betamethasone (4 mg/day) throughout pregnancy. IVIG (1 g/Kg) treatment in the neonates was begun at birth and administered every fifteen days until passive maternal antibodies became undetectable. Statistical analysis: Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney U, two way ANOVA and Spearman’s tests; p< 0. 05 was considered as significant. Results and Conclusion. Part I: The epitope specificity of anti-p 200 antibodies was the position 233. We suggest that this antibody specificity might be a tool to identify high risk pregnancies for CHB. The results might contribute to identify antibody specificity closely associated with development of CHB and to provide the possibility to explore the role of this antibody in the pathogenesis of CHB. Part II: We developed an animal model for CHB by a simple technique of passive transfer of human IgG from a patient with a child with CHB. High levels (4 mg) of anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La antibodies induce bradycardia, atrioventricular time prolongation and a decreased cardiac performance. Whereas, low levels (2 mg) of these antibodies determine a decrease in cardiac performance. Part III: The obtained results from these case series are: a) the efficacy in treating 2 nd degree CHB, and b) the safety of plasmapheresis and IVIG therapies. The low number of treated cases, the relatively short follow-up (mean 22. 7 months ± 10. 4 SD, range 12 - 42 months) and the high cost of the procedure can all be considered limits. Part IV: Plasmapheresis reduces the levels of anti-Ro 52, anti-p 200 and anti-La antibodies. However, a decrease of antibody amounts in patients with the highest anti-Ro 52 antibody levels has not been demonstrate...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of <b>fetal</b> <b>electrocardiogram</b> (f- ECG) waveforms, {{as well as}} fetal heart-rate (fHR) evaluation, provide {{important}} information {{about the condition of}} the fetus during pregnancy. A continuous monitoring of f-ECG, for example using the technologies already applied for adults ECG tele-monitoring (e. g., Wireless Body Sensor Networks, WBSNs), may increase early detection of fetal arrhythmias. In this work, we propose a novel framework, based on Compressive Sensing (CS) theory, for the compression and joint detection/classification of mother and fetal heart beats...|$|E

In this paper, a method for removal of background noise and artifacts from FECG signals using adaptive filters is proposed. The proposed method uses adaptive noise cancellation and digital filters for FECG extraction. Proposed FECG extraction algorithm is implemented in MATLAB using simulink models. Simulation results shows that fetal heart rate can be extracted by counting the peaks of R-R interval from the extracted FECG noise free signal...|$|E
