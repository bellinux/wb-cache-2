The approach resulted in the Enterprise nearing the edge of the nebula, and they quickly depart. Afterwards, D'Sora reveals to Data over a romantic dinner in his quarters that she broke up with her boyfriend because he was emotionally unavailable and then pursued <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the same. Data realises that she is breaking up with him and explains that he will delete the subroutine. D'Sora departs and Data blows out the candles seemingly unperturbed.|$|E
5|$|Estes' {{organization}} {{attracted a}} $3,000 donation from Anita Bryant, and her pastor traveled to Seattle to give advice on Estes' campaign. However, where Estes {{planned to use}} the network of conservative churches in the city, many members were discouraged from working with <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a Mormon. The tone of the advertising for the campaign was more dire than in Miami; ads claimed homosexuals were responsible for half the murders and suicides in major cities and half the cases of syphilis. Perhaps the most significant factor of the campaign was Estes' co-chair, a police officer named Dennis Falk. Two months before election day, Falk shot and killed a suspect {{who turned out to}} be a black, mentally retarded, young boy. The black community was furious with Falk, and transferred their anger to Initiative Thirteen.|$|E

Mijangos Lopez had been under the fatal impression {{that the government was}} not going to assassinate <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> on a wheelchair since 1958.|$|E

I didn't see any blood. His head didn't seem to move.... I felt like I was a million miles away, like this was all a dream.|$|E

25|$|Historians differ {{over the}} motive for his {{conversion}} to Islam. Some suggest it was a reaction to a social slight inflicted upon <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a Jew, while others suggest he was forcibly converted {{at the edge of}} a sword (which prompted Maimonides to comment upon Anusim). Despite his conversion to Islam, his works continued to be studied at the Jewish Baghdad Academy, a well-known academy, into the thirteenth century. He was a follower of Avicenna's teaching, who proposed an explanation of the acceleration of falling bodies by the accumulation of successive increments of power with successive increments of velocity.|$|E
25|$|In 1965 {{he married}} schoolteacher Linda Moore in Bakersfield, but they {{divorced}} two years later. Unable {{to find any}} gainful employment, he became a migrant worker. Dalkowski experienced problems with alcohol abuse. He drank heavily {{as a player and}} his drinking escalated after the end of his career. He received help from the Association of Professional Ball Players of America (APBPA) periodically from 1974 to 1992 and went through rehabilitation. He was able to find a job and stay sober for several months but soon went back to drinking. The APBPA stopped providing financial assistance to <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> using the funds to purchase alcohol.|$|E
25|$|Martínez {{was named}} the AL Pitcher of the Month in April, May, June and September 1999 – 4 times in a single season. Martínez punctuated his {{dominance}} in the 1999 All-Star Game start at Fenway Park, when he struck out Barry Larkin, Larry Walker, Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire and Jeff Bagwell in two innings. It {{was the first time}} any pitcher struck out the side to start an All-Star Game, and the performance earned Martínez the All-Star Game MVP award. Martínez later said that the 1999 All-Star break was especially memorable for <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> able to meet the members of the MLB All-Century Team and get an autograph from Ted Williams.|$|E

25|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} his disappearance, Heim {{was the target of}} a rapidly escalating manhunt and ever-increasing rewards for his capture. Following his escape there were reported sightings in Latin America, Spain and Africa, as well as formal investigations aimed at bringing him to justice, some of which took place even after he had apparently died in Egypt. The German government offered €150,000 for information leading to his arrest, while the Simon Wiesenthal Center launched Operation Last Chance, a project to assist governments in the location and arrest of suspected Nazi war criminals who are still alive. Tax records prove that, as late as 2001, Heim's lawyer asked the German authorities to refund capital gains taxes levied on <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> living abroad.|$|E
25|$|Bladel, {{a disgruntled}} former employee, {{had been arrested}} three months later in Indiana and extradited to Michigan. He had agreed {{to talk to the}} police without counsel. At his {{arraignment}} he requested that counsel be appointed for <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> indigent. The detective in charge of the investigation was present at the arraignment. A notice of appointment was then mailed to a law firm, but before the law firm received the notice, two police officers interviewed Bladel in the county jail and obtained a confession from him. Prior to that questioning, the officers had advised Bladel of his Miranda rights. Although Bladel had inquired about his representation several times since the arraignment, he was not told that a law firm had been appointed to represent him.|$|E
25|$|Donald Nathan Aldrich (24 October 1917 – 3 May 1947) was a United States Marine Corps Reserve {{captain and}} World War II flying ace. With 20 victories, Aldrich was the fifth-highest-scoring Marine Corps ace of the war. He joined the Royal Canadian Air Force after the United States Army Air Corps refused <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> married. Aldrich became an {{instructor}} pilot {{and transferred to}} the United States Marine Corps in late 1942. He joined VMF-215 in the Solomon Islands campaign in June 1943, flying the Vought F4U Corsair. Aldrich added to his 20 victories in three combat tours with six probables, the highest total number of probables in the Marine Corps. Postwar, Aldrich continued {{to serve in the}} Marine Corps and was killed in a 1947 plane crash.|$|E

25|$|On 17 August 1962, a teenaged East German, Peter Fechter, {{was shot}} in the pelvis by East German guards while trying to escape from East Berlin. His body lay tangled in a barbed wire fence, and he bled to death, {{in full view of the}} world's media. American {{soldiers}} could not rescue <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a few metres inside the Soviet sector. East German border guards were reluctant to approach him for fear of provoking Western soldiers, one of whom had shot an East German border guard just days earlier. More than an hour later, Fechter's body was removed by the East German guards. A spontaneous demonstration formed on the American side of the checkpoint, protesting the action of the East and the inaction of the West.|$|E
25|$|In spring 1642 the Irish Catholics formed {{their own}} government, the Catholic Confederation, with its capital at Kilkenny, {{and began to}} raise their own regular troops, more {{organized}} and capable than the irregular militia of the 1641 rebellion. Also in early 1642 the king sent in troop reinforcements from England and Scotland. The Irish Confederate War was under-way. Ormonde mounted several expeditions from Dublin in 1642, that cleared the area around Dublin of Confederate forces. He secured control of the area historically known as the Pale, and re-supplied some outlying garrisons, without serious contest. The Lords Justices, who suspected <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> related {{to many of the}} Confederate leaders, recalled him from command, after he had succeeded in lifting the siege of Drogheda in March 1642. In April he relieved the royalist garrisons at Naas, Athy and Maryborough, and on his return to Dublin he won the Battle of Kilrush against a larger force. He received the public thanks of the English Parliament and a monetary reward, and in September 1642 was put in command with a commission direct from the king.|$|E
25|$|When Lindsay Hassett {{retired after}} the 1953 Ashes Series his vice-captain Arthur Morris was not {{appointed}} to succeed <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not a state captain. In 1954-55 Australia had not played a Test series since and the selectors were divided {{as to who}} should be captain. As with everything else down under cricket was divided between the power centres of Sydney, New South Wales and Melbourne, Victoria. The fast bowling all-rounder Keith Miller was captain of New South Wales and {{the winner of the}} 1954-55 Sheffield Shield. He had the obvious advantage of being an automatic selection for the Australian team, and was a charismatic and inspirational leader on the field. Against him was his cavalier approach to the game and that he was little inclined to enforce discipline. His rival was the captain of Victoria, the off-spinner Ian Johnson. Johnson had been little used on the 1948 tour and was left behind in 1953 and was not an automatic selection for the Test team. However, {{he was the son of}} the Test selector William Johnson, had attended the elite Wesley College. Lindsay Hassett and the chairman of selectors Don Bradman favoured Johnson and he was appointed captain by the A.C.B.. Unlike Miller he was seen as a safe pair of hands and he was an astute captain and a fine ambassador for Australian cricket, but not everybody was happy with the choice. Frank Tyson reckoned that his innings victory in the First Test cost Australia the series as it confirmed Johnson in the captaincy, whereas Miller might have won the next three vital Tests. As it was vice-captain Arthur Morris was blamed for the defeat in Sydney and (strangely) Melbourne and the selectors stuck by Johnson. He went on to captain the successful Australian tour of the West Indies in 1954-55, where his diplomacy ensured that he did not suffer the same problems as Len Hutton in 1953-54, and his captaincy was considered to be equal to that of Richie Benaud. He retired after the Australian tour of England, Pakistan and India in 1956, where he again failed to regain the Ashes after being 1-0 up in the series.|$|E

[...] Cosimo III conceded defeat and recalled Gian Gastone to Florence in 1708; he never saw his wife again.|$|E
500|$|This {{rejection}} {{was not to}} last: a {{group of}} influential young Social Crediters, including the Premier's son Preston, started a movement to draft Strom.

[...] Strom accepted their overtures, but as late as a week before he announced his candidacy he was still offering to step aside in favour of another candidate of the young Turks' choice.|$|E
500|$|McCartney {{attended}} Stockton Wood Road Primary School in Speke from 1947 until 1949, when {{he transferred}} to Joseph Williams Junior School in Belle Vale because of overcrowding at Stockton. In 1953, with only three others out of ninety examinees, he passed the 11-Plus exam, meaning he could attend the Liverpool Institute, a grammar school rather than a secondary modern school. In 1954, he met schoolmate George Harrison on the bus from his suburban home in Speke. The two quickly became friends; McCartney later admitted: [...] "I tended to talk down to <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a year younger." ...|$|E
