50|$|The ring {{oscillator}} {{is a member}} of the class of time delay oscillators. A time-delay oscillator consists of an inverting amplifier with a delay element between the amplifier output and its input. The amplifier must have a gain greater than 1 at the intended oscillation frequency. Consider the initial case where the amplifier input and output voltages are momentarily balanced at a stable point. A small amount of noise can cause the amplifier output to rise slightly. After passing through the time-delay element, this small output voltage change will be presented to the amplifier input. The amplifier has a negative gain of greater than 1, so the output will change in the direction opposite to this input voltage. It will change by an amount larger than the input value, for a gain greater than 1. This amplified and reversed signal propagates from the output through the time-delay and back to the input where it is amplified and inverted again. The result of this sequential loop is a square-wave signal at the amplifier output with the period of each half of the square wave equal to the time delay. The square wave will grow until the amplifier output voltage reaches its limits, where it will stabilize. A more exact analysis will show that the wave that grows from the <b>initial</b> <b>noise</b> may not be square as it grows, but it will become square as the amplifier reaches its output limits.|$|E

Burgers equation @ t u + u:ru = u (1) is a simplied version of the Navier-Stokes equation, in which the terms of pressure and force are neglected. First introduced by Burgers (see [6]) as a simple model for hydrodynamic turbulence, Burgers equation also appears in dierent elds such as the theory of the interfaces for ballistic aggregation or in cosmology for the formation of superstructures in the universe (see [19] and references therein).

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} novel Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filter for linear {{system in which}} initial state, process and {{measurement}} noises are only known to be bounded (they can vary on compact sets, e. g., polytopes). This means that no probabilistic assumption is imposed on the distributions of <b>initial</b> state and <b>noises</b> besides the knowledge of their supports. These are the same assumptions {{that are used in}} set-membership estimation. By exploiting a formulation of set-membership estimation in terms of set of probability measures, we derive the equations of the set-membership PHD filter, which consist in propagating in time compact sets that include with guarantee the targets’ states. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the comparison with a sequential Monte Carlo PHD filter which instead assumes that <b>initial</b> state and <b>noises</b> have uniform distributions.

We assume that the signal consists of noise only during a short initialization period, and the <b>initial</b> <b>noise</b> characteristics are learned. The background noise is usually non-stationary, and hence the estimation requires to be adaptively updated or tracked.

40|$|It {{has been}} proven that the noise-tuning-based {{hysteretic}} noisy chaotic neural network (NHNCNN) can use the noise tuning factor to improve the optimization performance obviously at lower <b>initial</b> <b>noise</b> levels while can not at initial higher noise levels. In order to improve the optimization performance of the NHNCNN at initial higher noise levels, we introduce a new noise tuning factor into the activation function and propose an improved hysteretic noisy chaotic neural network (IHNCNN) model. By regulating {{the value of the}} newly introduced noise tuning factor, both noise levels of the activation function and hysteretic dynamics in the IHNCNN can be adjusted to help to improve the global optimization ability as the <b>initial</b> <b>noise</b> amplitude is higher. As a result, the IHNCNN can exhibit better optimization performance at initial higher noise levels. In order to demonstrate the advantage of the IHNCNN over the NHNCNN, the IHNCNN combined with gradual expansion scheme (GES) is applied to solve broadcast scheduling problem (BSP) in wireless multihop networks (WMNs).
