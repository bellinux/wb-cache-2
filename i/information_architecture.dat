40|$|Part 2 : Large Scale and Complex Information Systems for DevelopmentInternational audienceHealth {{sectors in}} {{developing}} countries are commonly struggling with disarrayed health <b>information</b> <b>architectures,</b> where multiple vertical, disease-specific programmes have implemented their isolated information systems. A consequence is parallel and overlapping systems where information is stored at different locations and in different formats. To address this, multiple global standardization efforts to harmonize health <b>information</b> <b>architectures</b> have been initiated. Still, there is only limited knowledge {{about the role of}} these global standardization communities in shaping national health <b>information</b> <b>architectures.</b> This article is based on a case study of the global Open Health Information Exchange (OpenHIE) standardization community. With an Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) ecosystem perspective, we aim to improve our understanding of the relationships between global standardization communities and national ICT ecosystems. Theoretically, we contribute with our conceptualization of national ICT ecosystems...|$|R

It is an emerging discipline and community of practice focused on bringing together principles of design and architecture to the digital landscape.

These activities include library systems and database development.|$|E

This framework should include easy to integrate patterns. The proposed just-in-time framework can change the <b>information</b> system's <b>architecture</b> and its implementation outcomes. The atomic <b>information</b> system <b>architecture's</b> role and applied the patterns are of crucial importance for the implementation phase of the complex business transformation projects; where these patterns can be adapted in a just-in-time manner, using atomic building blocks 1, 2, 26. There is also a need to govern (or control) the atomic <b>information</b> system <b>architecture's</b> patterns for business transformation projects; unfortunately an adaptable atomic <b>information</b> system <b>architecture</b> pattern for such projects is inexistent. An atomic <b>information</b> system <b>architecture</b> pattern can be also used in the enterprise's production activities which comes after the finalization of the implementation phase of business transformation project (business transformation project), to control and govern the resultant business system. The atomic <b>information</b> system <b>architecture's</b> pattern main component is the atomic building block that manages the implementation of autonomous business service transactions.

40|$|ABSTRACT: With recent {{advances}} in wireless technology, wireless networks can potentially offer a lowcost alternative to traditional cable-based systems, while providing flexible and reconfigurable <b>information</b> <b>architectures</b> tailored for sensing and control systems. Compared to cabled systems, wireless networks {{need to deal with}} the constraints of communication bandwidth, latency, range, and reliability. A prototype wireless sensing and control system has been developed to address some of the above mentioned information constraints.
