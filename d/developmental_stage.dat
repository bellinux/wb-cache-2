5|$|Insects are a {{major factor}} in the low yields of African cowpea crops, and they affect each tissue {{component}} and <b>developmental</b> <b>stage</b> of the plant. In bad infestations insect pressure is responsible for over 90% loss in yield. The legume pod borer, Maruca vitrata, is the main pre-harvest pest of the cowpea. Other important pests include pod sucking bugs, thrips and the post-harvest cowpea weevil, Callosobruchus maculatus.|$|E
5|$|In Odile's <b>developmental</b> <b>stage,</b> {{its heavy}} {{rainfall}} and storm surge inflicted minor coastal damage across southwestern Mexico and three deaths in Oaxaca and Jalisco. The most significant storm impacts {{occurred on the}} Baja California Peninsula, where damages amounted to approximately MXN$16.6billion (US$1.22billion). Power outages spurred by Odile's intense winds and rain cut electricity to 92%of the population of Baja California Sur. Severe flooding also occurred, causing rivers to swell and the mass evacuation {{of people out of}} hazardous low-lying areas. The remnants of Odile brought rains and unseasonably powerful thunderstorms to the southwestern United States. In total, Odile led to the deaths of 18people throughout its nine-day existence.|$|E
5|$|In plants, {{signaling}} by auxins, or phytohormones {{that order}} {{the direction and}} tropism of plant growth, induces the targeting of a class of transcription factor repressors known as Aux/IAA proteins for proteasomal degradation. These proteins are ubiquitinated by SCFTIR1, or SCF in complex with the auxin receptor TIR1. Degradation of Aux/IAA proteins derepresses transcription factors in the auxin-response factor (ARF) family and induces ARF-directed gene expression. The cellular consequences of ARF activation depend on the plant type and <b>developmental</b> <b>stage,</b> but are involved in directing growth in roots and leaf veins. The specific response to ARF derepression {{is thought to be}} mediated by specificity in the pairing of individual ARF and Aux/IAA proteins.|$|E
30|$|Hence {{the present}} study was done to provide a simple and {{practical}} method for assessing skeletal maturity using orthopantomographs, and to compare the eight <b>developmental</b> <b>stages</b> of the right mandibular second molar with that of six <b>developmental</b> <b>stages</b> of modified MP 3 of the right hand.

5|$|Although the {{presence}} of an embryo per se would be equivocal regarding this issue, the conditions in which the embryo were preserved provide strong evidence that Dinocephalosaurus was viviparous. There is no preserved calcified eggshell surrounding the embryo, despite {{the presence}} of delicately-preserved calcified elements from other animals at Luoping. This is consistent with the eggshells surrounding the embryos of viviparous reptiles being non-calcified membranes. Furthermore, the relative proportions of the humerus and the fibula in the embryo, compared with the maternal individual and IVPP V13898 from Panxian, indicate that the embryo is around 12% of the size of its mother. Combined with its ossified bones, this suggests that the embryo was at an advanced <b>developmental</b> <b>stage,</b> whereas crocodilians, birds, turtles, and tuataras lay eggs at very early developmental stages.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} Amarylidaceae genera, Narcissus {{contains}} unique isoquinoline alkaloids. The first alkaloid {{to be identified}} was lycorine, from N. pseudonarcissus in 1877. These are considered a protective adaptation, and are utilised in the classification of species. Nearly 100 alkaloids {{have been identified in}} the genus, about a third of all known Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, although not all species have been tested. Of the nine alkaloid ring types identified in the family, Narcissus species most commonly demonstrate the presence of alkaloids from within the Lycorine (lycorine, galanthine, pluviine) and Homolycorine (homolycorine, lycorenine) groups. Hemanthamine, Tazettine, Narciclasine, Montanine and Galantamine alkaloids are also represented. The alkaloid profile of any plant varies with time, location, and <b>developmental</b> <b>stage.</b> Narcissus also contain fructans and low molecular weight glucomannan in the leaves and plant stems.|$|E
5|$|In {{those species}} which {{reproduce}} sexually, haploid cells bud from the spores. Depending {{on the environmental}} conditions, either a myxamoeba or a myxoflagellate buds from the spore. Myxamoebae move like amoebae – that is, crawling on the substrate – and are produced in dry conditions. Myxoflagellates, which are peritrichous and can swim, develop in moist to wet environments. Myxoflagellates almost always have two flagella; one is generally shorter than the other and sometimes only vestigial. The flagella are used for locomotion and to help to move food particles closer. If the humidity changes, cells can switch between the two manifestations. Neither form has a cell wall. This <b>developmental</b> <b>stage</b> (and the next one) serves as a nourishment provider and {{is also known as}} the first trophic phase (nourishment phase). In this monocellular phase, the Myxogastria consume bacteria and fungus spores, and probably dissolved substances, and they reproduce through simple cell division. If the environmental conditions change adversely in this phase, for example extreme temperature, extreme dryness or food shortage, the Myxogastria may switch to very long-lived, thin-shelled quiescent states – the so-called microcysts. For that to happen, the myxamoebae assume a round shape and secrete a thin cell wall. In this state they can easily survive one year or longer. If living conditions improve, they become active again.|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims Plant growth, the {{increase}} of organ dimensions over time, and development, the change in plant structure, are often studied as two separate processes. However, there is structural and functional evidence that these two processes are strongly related. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the co-ordination between growth and development using mango trees, which have well-defined <b>developmental</b> <b>stages.</b> Methods <b>Developmental</b> <b>stages,</b> determined in an expert way, and organ sizes, determined from objective measurements, were collected during the vegetative growth and flowering phases of two cultivars of mango, Mangifera indica. For a given cultivar and growth unit type (either vegetative or flowering), a multistage model based on absolute growth rate sequences deduced from the measurements was first built, and then growth stages deduced from the model were compared with <b>developmental</b> <b>stages.</b> Key Results Strong matches were obtained between growth <b>stages</b> and <b>developmental</b> <b>stages,</b> leading to a consistent definition of integrative <b>developmental</b> growth <b>stages.</b> The growth stages highlighted growth asynchronisms between two topologically connected organs, namely the vegetative axis and its leaves. Conclusions Integrative <b>developmental</b> growth <b>stages</b> emphasize that <b>developmental</b> <b>stages</b> are closely related to organ growth rates. The results are discussed in terms of the possible physiological processes underlying these stages, including plant hydraulics, biomechanics and carbohydrate partitioning. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

5|$|The rotund to {{ellipsoid}} spores are 7.5–10µm {{long and}} 6–7.6µm wide. The surface ornamentation extends to 0.5µm high and is mainly from warts and short, wide ridges, which are linked through few fine lines {{to form an}} incomplete net (reticulum). The suprahilar area, a distinctly limited zone above the , is weakly amyloid. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and measure 45–60 × 9.5–12µm. They are roughly cylindrical to somewhat club-shaped and often have an oil droplet or a granular body. The sterigmata are 4.5–5.5µm long. The thin-walled pleurocystidia are sparse, but somewhat common near the gill edge. They are protruded and are 45–65µm long and 5–8µm wide, they are sometimes smaller near the gill edge. Nearly spindle-shaped, they are often straightened or constricted like a string of pearls at the apex. The body is often fine and grained. Pseudocystidia are largely present. They are 4–6µm wide and are sometimes protruded, but are often shorter than the basidioles (basidia in the early <b>developmental</b> <b>stage).</b> The basidioles are cylindric to spiral and have an ochre-coloured substance, similar to the laticifers. Near the top they are, however, almost hyaline (transparent). The gill edge is usually sterile and has a few to many cheilocystidia. The thin-walled cheiloleptocystidia are 15–25µm long and 5–10µm wide. They are almost club-shaped or irregularly shaped and transparent, and often contain a granular material. The cheilomacrocystidia are also thin-walled and measure 25–50µm long and 6–8µm wide. They are slightly spindle-shaped and often have a tip resembling a string of pearls; their interior is hyaline or granular. Laticifers are abundant, striking and body is ochre coloured. The cuticle of the cap is an ixocutis, whereby the hyphae are linked in a jellylike matrix, that can swell up in moisture to become heavily slimy.|$|E

25|$|Age {{and genetic}} factors {{influence}} {{the risk of}} developing alcohol-related neurotoxicity. Adolescence, especially early adolescence (i.e. before age 15), is a critical and delicate <b>developmental</b> <b>stage</b> for specialised neuronal and synaptic systems mature. This critical <b>developmental</b> <b>stage</b> is where lifelong adult traits e.g., talents, reasoning and complex skills mature; however alcohol and in particular binge drinking may disrupt and interfere with this developmental process. Adolescence is also a period of development characterised by a high level of novel seeking, thrill seeking and risk taking behaviour and thus alcohol and other drug experimentation and abuse is common. An adolescent rat study found that a relatively short exposure to high levels of alcohol resulted in long-lasting changes to functional brain activity with corresponding abnormalities in EEG brain waves that persisted into adulthood, including persisting disturbances in sleep EEG with a reduction in slow wave sleep. These EEG findings are similar to premature aging. According to one review of the literature, if the <b>developmental</b> <b>stage</b> of adolescence is similar to the <b>developmental</b> <b>stage</b> of the fetus with regard to sensitivity to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol, and if long-lasting or permanent damage to the brain occurs similar to what animal studies suggest, then this represents a major public health issue due to the high levels of alcohol use by adolescents. Indeed, alcohol can affect the remodeling and functional changes in synaptic plasticity and neuronal connectivity in different brain regions that occurs during adolescence (see this related article).|$|E
