40|$|This study {{examined}} the perception and cortical representation of <b>harmonic</b> complex <b>tones,</b> {{from the perspective of}} the spectral fusion evoked by such sounds. Experiment 1 tested whether ferrets spontaneously distinguish <b>harmonic</b> from inharmonic <b>tones.</b> In baseline sessions, ferrets detected a pure tone terminating a sequence of inharmonic tones. After they reached proficiency, a small fraction of the inharmonic tones were replaced with <b>harmonic</b> <b>tones.</b> Some of the animals confused the <b>harmonic</b> <b>tones</b> with the pure tones at twice the false-alarm rate. Experiment 2 sought correlates of harmonic fusion in single neurons of primary auditory cortex and anterior auditory field, by comparing responses to <b>harmonic</b> <b>tones</b> with those to inharmonic tones in the awake alert ferret. The effects of spectro-temporal filtering were accounted for by using the measured spectrotemporal receptive field to predict responses and by seeking correlates of fusion in the predictability of responses. Only 12 % of units sampled distinguished <b>harmonic</b> <b>tones</b> from inharmonic tones, a small percentage that is consistent with the relatively weak ability of the ferrets to spontaneously discriminate <b>harmonic</b> <b>tones</b> from inharmonic tones in Experiment 1...|$|R

40|$|Perception and neural coding of harmonicity 1 Despite much attention, the {{cortical}} {{representation of}} harmonic sounds has eluded explanation. This study approached {{the problem from}} the point of view of the spectral fusion evoked by such sounds. Experiment 1 tested whether ferrets automatically fuse <b>harmonic</b> <b>tones.</b> In baseline sessions, fer-rets detected a pure tone terminating a sequence of inharmonic tones. After they reached proficiency in the baseline task, a small fraction of the inhar-monic tones were replaced with <b>harmonic</b> <b>tones.</b> Some of the animals con-fused the <b>harmonic</b> <b>tones</b> with the pure tones at twice the false-alarm rate, indicating that ferrets can fuse the components of a <b>harmonic</b> <b>tone.</b> Exper-iment 2 sought correlates of harmonic fusion in single neurons of primary auditory cortex (AI) and anterior field (AAF), by contrasting responses to <b>harmonic</b> <b>tones</b> with those to inharmonic tones in the awake alert ferret. The effects of spectrotemporal filtering were accounted for by using the mea-sured spectrotemporal receptive field to predict responses and by seeking correlates of fusion in the predictability of responses. Only twelve percent of units sampled distinguished <b>harmonic</b> <b>tones</b> from inharmonic tones. The paucity of such units suggests that processes mediating harmonic fusion and pitch perception are unlikely to be centered in AI or AAF...|$|R

50|$|The QY10's <b>tone</b> <b>generator</b> is a sample-based {{synthesizer}} using Yamaha's 12-bit Advanced Wave Memory synthesis technology.

In microcontroller system, PIC 16 F 877 microcontroller is used to control the call processing. Dial tone, busy tone and ring tone are provided during call progress. Instead of using ready made <b>tone</b> <b>generator</b> IC, oscillator based <b>tone</b> <b>generator</b> is used. The results of this telephone exchange system are perfect for homes and small businesses needing the extensions. It requires the phone operation control system, the analog interface circuit and the switching circuit. This exchange design will contain eight channels. It is the best low cost, good quality telephone exchange for today‚Äôs telecommunication needs. It offers the features available in much more expensive PBX units without using high-priced phones.

40|$|Hierarchical {{processing}} {{suggests that}} spectrally and temporally complex stimuli will evoke more activation than do simple stimuli, particularly in non-primary auditory fields. This hypothesis {{was tested using}} two tones, a single frequency <b>tone</b> and a <b>harmonic</b> <b>tone,</b> that were either static or frequency modulated to create four stimuli. We interpret the location of differences in activation by drawing comparisons between fMRI and human cytoarchitectonic data, reported in the same brain space. <b>Harmonic</b> <b>tones</b> produced more activation than single tones in right Heschl‚Äôs gyrus (HG) and bilaterally in the lateral supratemporal plane (STP). Activation was also greater to frequency-modulated tones than to static tones in these areas, plus in left HG and bilaterally in an anterolateral part of the STP and the superior temporal sulcus. An elevated response magnitude to both frequency-modulated tones {{was found in the}} lateral portion of the primary area, and putatively in three surrounding non-primary regions on the lateral STP (one anterior and two posterior to HG). A focal site on the posterolateral STP showed an especially high response to the frequency-modulated <b>harmonic</b> <b>tone.</b> Our data highlight the involvement of both primary and lateral non-primary auditory regions...|$|R
