40|$|Abstract. This is {{a survey}} on <b>eigenfunctions</b> of the Laplacian on Riemannian {{manifolds}} (mainly compact and without boundary). We discuss both local results obtained by analyzing <b>eigenfunctions</b> on small balls, and global results obtained by wave equation methods. Among the main topics are nodal sets, quantum limits, and Lp norms of global <b>eigenfunctions.</b> The {{emphasis is on}} the connection between the behavior of <b>eigenfunctions</b> and the dynamics of the geodesic flow, reflecting the relation between quantum mechanics and the underlying classical mechanics. We also discuss the analytic continuation of <b>eigenfunctions</b> of real analytic Riemannian manifolds (M, g) to the complexification of M and its applications to nodal geometry. Besides <b>eigenfunctions,</b> we also consider quasi-modes and random linear combinations of <b>eigenfunctions</b> with close eigenvalues. Many examples are discussed...|$|R

25|$|If the {{interval}} is unbounded, {{or if the}} coefficients have singularities at the boundary points, one calls L singular. In this case, the spectrum no longer consists of eigenvalues alone and can contain a continuous component. There is still an associated <b>eigenfunction</b> expansion (similar to Fourier series versus Fourier transform). This is important in quantum mechanics, since the one-dimensional time-independent Schrödinger equation is a special case of a S–L equation.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} <b>eigenfunctions</b> of the edge-based Laplacian on a graph and the {{relationship}} of these functions to random walks on the graph. We commence by discussing the set of <b>eigenfunctions</b> supported at the vertices, and demonstrate the relationship of these <b>eigenfunctions</b> to the classical random walk on the graph. Then, from an analysis of functions supported only on the interior of edges, we develop a method for explicitly calculating the edge-interior <b>eigenfunctions</b> of the edge-based Laplacian. This reveals a connection between the edge-based Laplacian and the adjacency matrix of backtrackless random walk on the graph. The edge-based <b>eigenfunctions</b> therefore correspond to some <b>eigenfunctions</b> of the normalised Hashimoto matrix. Comment: 10 pages, 1 figur...|$|R
