5|$|These {{features}} were absent from earlier Sumerian excavations. Sophisticated techniques of arrangement of texts, coupled with their composition, evidence the great antiquity of archival and library practices, {{which may be}} far older than {{was assumed to be}} the case before the discovery of the Ebla library. A sizable portion of the tablets contain literary and lexicographic texts; evidence seems to suggest the collection also served—at least partially—as a true library rather than a collection of archives intended solely for use by the kings, their ministers, and their bureaucracy. The tablets show evidence of the early transcription of texts into foreign languages and scripts, classification and cataloging for easier retrieval, and arrangement by size, <b>form</b> <b>and</b> <b>content.</b> The Ebla tablets have thus provided scholars with new insights into the origin of library practices that were in use 4,500 years ago.|$|E

40|$|Quality {{of tourist}} travel is a {{relative}} category, because its success depends on the subjective perception of the personality of tourists on a tourist trip. For this reason, any tourist trip can be treated {{from the perspective of}} different types of figurative forms of tourists' personality, which also determine different quality of tourist travel, which, in turn, makes them different. Thus, any tourist trip, unto itself, has its own uniqueness, taking on the <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> <b>content</b> created, for the most part, by the tourists themselves, along with all other tourism stakeholders involved in this process. These <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> <b>contents</b> are primarily conditioned by the spiritual profile of tourists' personality and their psychological and motivational preferences, which is symbolically represented in the figurative context of a chess game. In addition to this, identification of essential characteristics of different spiritual profiles of tourist's personality, must be a starting point for the programming of overall <b>content</b> <b>and</b> especially of animation <b>and</b> cultural <b>content...</b>|$|R

25|$|A {{much more}} {{plausible}} {{theory is that}} the templon models, in both <b>form</b> <b>and</b> <b>content,</b> the decorative wall of the Torah screen in Jewish synagogues of the 2nd and 3rd centuries. These, too, had three main divisions: a central door leading to the altar, smaller flanking passages, and a distribution of parts similar to a templon. The Torah screen was probably not the direct prototype of the templon; it probably derives from the imitation of the Torah screen in the altar of a typical Syrian pagan temple.|$|E
25|$|Workplace {{bullying}} overlaps to {{some degree}} with workplace incivility but tends to encompass more intense and typically repeated acts of disregard and rudeness. Negative spirals of increasing incivility between organizational members can result in bullying, but isolated acts of incivility are not conceptually bullying despite the apparent similarity in their <b>form</b> <b>and</b> <b>content.</b> In case of bullying, the intent of harm is less ambiguous, an unequal balance of power (both formal and informal) is more salient, and the target of bullying feels threatened, vulnerable and unable to defend himself or herself against negative recurring actions.|$|E

25|$|However, {{evidence}} of Shakespeare's authorship {{has also been}} found within the play. For example, Samuel Johnson argued that the play was more competently written than King John, Richard II, 1 Henry IV, 2 Henry IV and Henry V, and, therefore, not attributing it to Shakespeare based on quality made little sense. A similar point is made by Lawrence V. Ryan, who suggests that the play fits so well into Shakespeare's overall style, with an intricate integration of <b>form</b> <b>and</b> <b>content,</b> that it was most likely written by him alone.|$|E
25|$|The {{literary}} {{criticism of the}} Renaissance developed classical ideas of unity of <b>form</b> <b>and</b> <b>content</b> into literary neoclassicism, proclaiming literature as central to culture, entrusting the poet and the author with preservation of a long literary tradition. The birth of Renaissance criticism was in 1498, with the recovery of classic texts, most notably, Giorgio Valla's Latin translation of Aristotle's Poetics. The work of Aristotle, especially Poetics, {{was the most important}} influence upon {{literary criticism}} until the late eighteenth century. Lodovico Castelvetro {{was one of the most}} influential Renaissance critics who wrote commentaries on Aristotle's Poetics in 1570.|$|E
25|$|Gluck {{had long}} pondered the {{fundamental}} problem of <b>form</b> <b>and</b> <b>content</b> in opera. He thought both of the main Italian operatic genres – opera buffa and opera seria – had strayed too far from what opera should really be and seemed unnatural. Opera buffa had long lost its original freshness. Its jokes were threadbare and the repetition of the same characters made them seem no more than stereotypes. In opera seria the singing was devoted to superficial effects and the content was uninteresting and fossilised. As in opera buffa, the singers were effectively absolute masters of the stage and the music, decorating the vocal lines so floridly that audiences could no longer recognise the original melody. Gluck wanted to return opera to its origins, focusing on human drama and passions and making words and music of equal importance.|$|E

40|$|Fifty {{patients}} with a primary diagnosis of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) were studied {{during the course of}} the year 1994 from a phenomenological point of view in order to delineate the various <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> <b>contents</b> of obsessions <b>and</b> compulsions. An attempt was made to highlight the frequency with which the different <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> <b>contents</b> occur. Six types of obsessions were identified: doubts, thoughts, fear (phobia), images, impulses and miscellaneous. Compulsive acts were classified into two types: yielding <b>and</b> controlling. The <b>contents</b> of obsessions could be classified into eight broad categories as relating to: dirt and contamination, germs, aggression, sex, religion, blasphemy, illness and indecisiveness. Thirty eight percent of the patients displayed obses-sional thoughts related to dirt and contamination, while forty per cent showed religious and blasphemous obsessional thoughts and doubts. Fifty six percent of the patients had compulsions of which 36 % were multiple, while 20 % displayed only a single compulsion. The paper discusses these findings and emphasizes the role played by socio-cultural and religious factors in shaping the character of an obsessional thought content...|$|R

25|$|Every cleric in Holy Orders {{and many}} other members of {{religious}} orders must publicly join in or privately read aloud (i.e. using the lips {{as well as the}} eyes—it takes about two hours in this way) the whole of the Breviary services allotted for each day. In large churches where they were celebrated the services were usually grouped; e.g. Matins and Lauds (about 7.30 A.M.); Prime, Terce (High Mass), Sext, and None (about 10 A.M.); Vespers and Compline (4 P.M.); and from four to eight hours (depending on the amount of music and the number of high masses) are thus spent in choir. Lay use of the Breviary has varied throughout the Church's history. In some periods laymen did not use the Breviary as a manual of devotion to any great extent. The late Medieval period saw the recitation of certain hours of the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin, which was based on the Breviary in <b>form</b> <b>and</b> <b>content,</b> becoming popular among those who could read, and Bishop Challoner did much to popularise the hours of Sunday Vespers and Compline (albeit in English translation) in his 'Garden of the Soul' in the eighteenth century. The Liturgical Movement in the twentieth century saw renewed interest in the Offices of the Breviary and several popular editions were produced containing the vernacular as well as the Latin.|$|E
