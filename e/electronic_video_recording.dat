50|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Recording,</b> or EVR, was a film-based video {{recording}} format developed by Hungarian-born engineer Peter Carl Goldmark at CBS Laboratories in the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|In 1967 CBS Laboratories {{introduced}} the <b>Electronic</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Recording</b> format, which used video and telecined-to-video film sources, {{which were then}} recorded with an electron-beam recorder at CBS' EVR mastering plant {{at the time to}} 35mm film stock in a rank of 4 strips on the film, which was then slit down to 4 8.75 mm film copies, for playback in an EVR player.|$|E
50|$|P.M.G Toulon, a French {{inventor}} {{working at}} Westinghouse Electric during the 1950s and 1960s patented {{a system in}} 1952 (US Patent 3198880) which used a slow spinning disc with a spiral track of photographically 1.5 millimeter wide recorded frames, along with a flying spot scanner, which swept over them to produce a video image. This {{was intended to be}} synchronously combined with playback from a vinyl record. It appears a working system was never produced. It has similarities with the tape based <b>Electronic</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Recording</b> system, which was released for professional use.|$|E

The only known copy of the play was junked in 1968, as was the standard practice of the time, {{despite the fact that}} Dylan and lead actor David Warner were by then famous. Although extensive searches have been made by the BBC, only partial audio recordings of four songs sung by Dylan survive.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a paper and pencil-based method for capturing naturally occurring interactions in ethnographic fieldwork notes where no <b>electronic</b> (audio / <b>video)</b> <b>recording</b> equipment can be used. The method {{was developed for}} a study exploring the practical accomplishment of hospital-based physiotherapy education. Physiotherapy is a movement and touch-based healthcare profession where students learn by shadowing and co-working with qualified therapists. To observe real time placement-based physiotherapy education {{it was important to}} capture the non-verbal and physical (contact and spatial), as well as the verbal elements of the observed interactions. The method is based on Laban-Bartenieff Movement Analysis and the work of Birdwhistell, Heath, and Goffman and captures the minutiae of some elements of participants’ interactional use of gaze and space. This paper describes the development of the method and illustrates its use in the context of hospital-based physiotherapy education...|$|R

40|$|<b>Video</b> <b>recording</b> is underused in {{improving}} patient safety and understanding performance shaping factors in patient care. We report {{our experience of}} using <b>video</b> <b>recording</b> techniques in a trauma centre, including how to gain cooperation of clinicians for <b>video</b> <b>recording</b> of their workplace performance, identify strengths of video compared with observation, and suggest processes for consent and maintenance of confidentiality of <b>video</b> <b>records.</b> <b>Video</b> <b>records</b> are {{a rich source of}} data for documenting clinician performance which reveal safety and systems issues not identified by observation. Emergency procedures and <b>video</b> <b>records</b> of critical events identified patient safety, clinical, quality assurance, systems failures, and ergonomic issues. <b>Video</b> <b>recording</b> is a powerful feedback and training tool and provides a reusable record of events that can be repeatedly reviewed and used as research data. It allows expanded analyses of time critical events, trauma resuscitation, anaesthesia, and surgical tasks. To overcome some of the key obstacles in deploying <b>video</b> <b>recording</b> techniques, researchers should (1) develop trust with <b>video</b> <b>recorded</b> subjects, (2) obtain clinician participation for introduction of a new protocol or line of investigation, (3) report aggregated <b>video</b> <b>recorded</b> data and use clinician reviews for feedback on covert processes and cognitive analyses, and (4) involve multidisciplinary experts in medicine and nursing...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{increasing}} numbers of researchers have begun to investigate second language acquisition within the socio-cultural context in which it occurs using qualitative methods and approaches such as an ethnographic approach. This frequently entails audio and/or <b>video</b> <b>recording</b> {{of the participants in}} naturalistic contexts. Yet theoretical and methodological issues related to <b>video</b> <b>recording</b> have not yet received {{a great deal of attention}} in the second language acquisition literature. The purpose of this paper is to initiate such a discussion among SLA researchers. This is accomplished by reviewing the visual anthropology, educational anthropology, and ethnographic filmmaking literature on three questions concerning the collection of valid <b>video</b> <b>recorded</b> data: a) How should the interaction be <b>video</b> <b>recorded?</b> b) Who should be <b>video</b> <b>recorded?</b> c) Who should do the <b>video</b> <b>recording?</b> Examples from my own research are presented to illustrate the kinds of problems that might be encountered in each of these areas. Finally I present my reflections on the decisions I made when videotaping so that other SLA researchers using <b>video</b> <b>recording</b> might gain some insights that will assist them when dealing with the theoretical, methodological and practical considerations of planning and implementing their SLA studies using an ethnographic approach...|$|R

5|$|Throughout the 1970s, {{electro-mechanical}} arcade {{games were}} gradually replaced by <b>electronic</b> <b>video</b> games, following {{the release of}} Pong in 1972, with 1978's Space Invaders dealing a yet more powerful blow to the popularity of mechanical games. Light guns used in <b>electronic</b> <b>video</b> games work in the opposite manner to their mechanical counterparts: the sensor is in the gun and pulling the trigger allows it to receive light from the on-screen targets. Computer light pens had been used for practical purposes at MIT in the early 1960s, and the Magnavox Odyssey had a light gun accessory, {{in the production of}} which Nintendo was involved.|$|R

40|$|Background: Technological {{developments}} {{allow for}} a variety of applications of <b>video</b> <b>recording</b> in health care, including endoscopic procedures. Although the value of video registration is recognized, medicolegal concerns regarding the privacy of patients and professionals are growing. A clear understanding of the legal framework is lacking. Therefore, this research aims to provide insight into the juridical position of patients and professionals regarding <b>video</b> <b>recording</b> in health care practice. Methods: Jurisprudence was searched to exemplify legislation on <b>video</b> <b>recording</b> in health care. In addition, legislation was translated for different applications of video in health care found in the literature. Results: Three principles in Western law are relevant for <b>video</b> <b>recording</b> in health care practice: (1) regulations on privacy regarding personal data, which apply to the gathering and processing of video data in health care settings; (2) the patient <b>record,</b> in which <b>video</b> data can be stored; and (3) professional secrecy, which protects the privacy of patients including video data. Practical implementation of these principles in <b>video</b> <b>recording</b> in health care does not exist. Conclusion: Practical regulations on <b>video</b> <b>recording</b> in health care for different specifically defined purposes are needed. Innovations in video capture technology that enable video data to be made anonymous automatically can contribute to protection for the privacy of all the people involved...|$|R
