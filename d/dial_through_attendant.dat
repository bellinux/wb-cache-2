50|$|To place {{calls to}} certain other Northern California exchanges, such as Sacramento, Stockton, and Vallejo in Northern California, dial {{customers}} would dial ‘’0’’ {{to reach an}} operator. The operator <b>dialed</b> <b>through</b> a tandem switch and directly called numbers in those cities. These calls were indicated by {{a star in the}} telephone directory. For other call destinations, customers dialed ‘’211’’ to reach a long distance operator who would connect the customer using manual trunks to reach a distant operator.|$|R
5000|$|It {{originally}} formed one of {{a network}} of 18 Zone Switching Centres within the United Kingdom (UK) telephone system that provided trunk switching facilities within its own charge group and to Group Switching Centres (GSC) within an area broadly comprising the West Midlands and central Wales. The exchange formed part of the trunk mechanisation plan commenced in 1939 to permit operators from originating GSCs to <b>dial</b> <b>through</b> to a distant UK subscriber without requiring further operator intervention. Later, it was additionally used to switch subscriber dialled trunk calls after its introduction at Bristol in 1958.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, a {{payphone}} operator collects an FCC-mandated fee of 49.4¢ {{from the}} owner of a toll-free number for each call successfully placed to that number from the payphone. This results in many toll-free numbers rejecting calls from payphones in an attempt to avoid this surcharge; calling cards, which require the caller to <b>dial</b> <b>through</b> a toll-free number, will often pass this surcharge back to the caller, either as a separate itemized charge, a 50¢ to 90¢ increase in the price of the call, or (in the case of many pre-paid calling cards) the deduction of an extra number of minutes from the balance of the pre-paid card.|$|R

This interview was given during her visit to one of the Facebook Friends. In the article she says there are different types of friendships one makes in their lifetime. There are friends whom you will spend time to just have a coffee, some you keep in touch through the various social networking sites, and others you add in your speed <b>dial.</b> <b>Through</b> this journey, Brooks recounts, she had added every friend she has met in her speed dial.|$|R
5000|$|One {{method of}} adding a {{bandspread}} control {{was to put}} a relatively small value variable tuning capacitor and dial directly in parallel with the main tuning variable capacitor ( [...] or connected to a tap on the coil of the tuned circuit). The smaller capacitor would have much less effect on the resonant frequency than the main capacitor, allowing fine discrimination of the tuned frequency. A second method, mechanical bandspread, was a second tuning knob connected through a gear train to the main tuning knob; each turn of the bandspread dial moved the main <b>dial</b> <b>through</b> {{a small part of}} its range, improving the precision of tuning.|$|R

5000|$|The {{computer}} industry needed {{a way to}} tell the modem what number to <b>dial</b> <b>through</b> software. The earlier separate dialers had this capability, but only {{at the cost of}} a separate port, which a microcomputer might not have available. Another solution would have been to use a separate set of [...] "command pins" [...] dedicated to sending and receiving commands, another could have used a signal pin indicating that the modem should interpret incoming data as a command. Both of these had hardware support in the RS-232 standard. However, many implementations of the RS-232 port on microcomputers were extremely basic, and some eliminated many of these pins as a cost saving measure.|$|R
5000|$|The first digital {{pocket watch}} was the {{invention}} of Austrian engineer Josef Pallweber who created his [...] "jump-hour" [...] mechanism in 1883. Instead of a conventional dial, the jump-hour featured two windows in an enamel <b>dial,</b> <b>through</b> which the hours and minutes are visible on rotating discs. The second hand remained conventional. By 1885 Pallweber mechanism {{was already on the}} market in pocket watches by Cortébert and IWC; arguably contributing to the subsequent rise and commercial success of IWC. The principles of Pallweber jump-hour movement had appeared in wristwatches by the 1920s (Cortébert) and are still used today (Chronoswiss Digiteur). While the original inventor didn't have a watch brand at the time, his name has since been resurrected by a newly established watch manufacturer.|$|R

50|$|This {{is a type}} of {{maintaining}} power which needs to be engaged before re-winding is started. It consists of a weighted arm (bolt) with a ratchet pawl on the end of it which engages with the edge of the first wheel to keep it turning while the weight or spring is wound. To make sure that it was always operated, the hole in the <b>dial</b> <b>through</b> which the clock is wound is covered with a shutter which can be moved out of the way by pushing down on a lever {{at the side of the}} dial. This lever also engages the bolt. A similar type of mechanism is sometimes used on turret clocks. Because these take much longer to wind, and are usually wound by trained staff, the bolt carries a segment of a gear wheel rather than a single pawl and is engaged manually.|$|R

The Centre also has about 240 Linux and Windows 2000/XP PCs, and 40 engineering Graphics workstations. All the computers in the centre are connected through a 10/100 Mbit/s network. Computer Centre supports an institute-wide 100 Mbit/s fiber optic network that connects all the academic departments, central library, and administrative departments to the Computer Centre.

50|$|Dialers are {{necessary}} to connect to the internet (at least for non-broadband connections), but some dialers are designed to connect to premium-rate numbers. The providers of such dialers often search for security holes in the operating system installed on the user's computer {{and use them to}} set the computer up to <b>dial</b> up <b>through</b> their number, so as to make money from the calls. Alternatively, some dialers inform the user what it is that they are doing, with the promise of special content, accessible only via the special number. Examples of this content include software for download, (usually illegal) trojans posing as MP3s, trojans posing as pornography, or 'underground' programs such as cracks and keygens.|$|R

CBS had likely been carrying NFL games since at least 1935, when George A.

50|$|Radio {{stations}} in North America {{are permitted to}} uplink to satellite. WSM in Nashville, Tennessee, {{received a lot of}} attention in the 1980s as it was delivered via C-band alongside The Nashville Network. Very few stations actually distribute themselves through C-band, as there is not much reason to do so and the station's audio can be <b>dialed</b> in <b>through</b> either ISDN lines, or listened to via an audio stream over the internet (if the station offers such). Ones that do, like WEEI in Boston, often do so to feed their station to others that simulcast the programming. This is the case with several {{stations in}} Mexico, as radio broadcasting in that country is very nationalized and most local stations are merely 24-hour-a-day affiliates of a national network.|$|R
