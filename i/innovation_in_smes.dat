30|$|This {{review study}} has {{revealed}} several key issues regarding open <b>innovation</b> <b>in</b> <b>SMEs.</b> There is {{limited number of}} studies in the top-notch journals. Scholars from the European Union have {{played a major role}} in the literature. Some Asian countries such as China, South Korea, and Taiwan have been explored to a considerable extent. The articles on open <b>innovation</b> <b>in</b> <b>SMEs</b> have appeared in a wide range of journals. Simple statistical analyses are used in most of the studies. Hence, future studies should adopt highly sophisticated analysis techniques. Most of the impactful articles are based on panel data. Studies based on primary data would bring very intuitive results.

We attended to the dearth of studies on <b>innovation</b> <b>in</b> <b>SMEs</b> and then extended our review of studies on SMEs to other fields.

We found that the former stream of literature has attracted more studies. Plenty of {{studies have been done}} on innovation in large firms; however, there is a dearth of studies on the types of innovation that SMEs pursue. We developed our research questions to expose this aspect of the literature.|$|E

Very important is to prepare young entrepreneurs in this context besides the achieving of skills like leading, coordination, organisation and creativity. Vocational education and training of entrepreneurs should enable the integration of people with special needs i. e. by mentoring. Conclusions of studies and projects coordinated by the author show that issues like problem-based learning, informal and social learning, diversity, mentoring by intensive use of social media can contribute to growth and <b>innovation</b> <b>in</b> <b>SMEs</b> and to increase the motivation of staff.

30|$|In general, SMEs lack both {{managerial}} {{and technical}} skills for their effectiveness (Rahman and Ramos 2010). They are less active than large firms in open innovation {{because of their}} particular characteristics such as organization, culture and strategy. A study by the OECD found that only 5 - 20 % of SMEs are actively using open innovation approach. Studies on open <b>innovation</b> <b>in</b> <b>SMEs</b> are fragmented (Bianchi et al. 2010; Colombo et al. 2014). Some scholars argue that SMEs can achieve greater benefits from the open innovation than larger firms because of their less bureaucracy, increased willingness to take risks, and faster ability to react to changing environments (Parida et al. 2012). In addition, studies also show that open innovation is a promising means for SMEs to overcome their challenges and increase their profitability (Gassmann et al. 2010). Methods that can help SMEs to overcome barriers to the successful implementation of open innovation are necessary to explore. Consequently, integration of fragmented state of the literature is essential. The objective {{of this study is}} to examine current research on open <b>innovation</b> <b>in</b> <b>SMEs</b> to integrate empirical findings and to point out future research agenda.|$|E
