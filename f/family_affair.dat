5|$|Niedermayer missed several games {{early in}} the 2001–02 season due to back pain, and his 33 points on the season was his lowest in six seasons. Niedermayer and the Devils reached their fourth Stanley Cup Final in 2002–03. The series was a <b>family</b> <b>affair,</b> as Scott's brother Rob {{was a member of}} the {{opposing}} Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. When asked, their mother admitted she was hoping Rob's Mighty Ducks would win as Scott already had two championships to his name. Scott dashed his brother and mother's hopes, recording two assists in the deciding seventh game to lead the Devils to a 3–0 victory, and win his third Stanley Cup.|$|E
5|$|Of these, Ganesh Chaturthi is {{the most}} popular in the state of Maharashtra, however, Diwali, the most popular festival of Hindus {{throughout}} India, is equally popular in Maharashtra. Deshasthas celebrate the Ganesha festival as a domestic <b>family</b> <b>affair.</b> Depending on a family's tradition, a clay image or shadu is worshiped for one and a half, three and a half, seven or full 10 days, before ceremoniously being placed in a river or the sea. This tradition of private celebration was inspired by the public celebration introduced in 1894 by Bal Gangadhar Tilak. Modak is a popular food item during the festival. Ganeshotsav also incorporates other festivals, namely Hartalika and the Gauri festival, the former is observed with a fast by women whilst the latter by the installation of idols of Gauris.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, Baillie {{teamed up}} with singer Adam Ant (whose drummer Hayley Leggs had been a member, {{alongside}} Baillie, of burlesque troupe The Satanic Sluts) to compose the song Gun in Your Pocket, about Ross, Brand and the entire affair. He intended to release the song as the lead single for his ninth album Adam Ant Is the Blueblack Hussar in Marrying the Gunner's Daughter (with a rerecording of early 1980s outtake Who's A Goofy Bunny Then? as the B-side in tribute to the recently deceased Malcolm McLaren). Gun in Your Pocket was performed live {{on at least one}} occasion, at a guerilla gig (one of several he played around this time) at London's Troubadour Café on 2 April 2010, and was setlisted, (but not performed) at Adam's Pirate Metal Extravanganza concert at the Scala on 30 April 2010, while the recording received a club play when Adam DJ'd at the <b>Family</b> <b>Affair</b> clubnight in Shoreditch, London on 24 April.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the agency}} {{representing}} Blair did not send {{her for the}} role, Blair's mother took her to meet with Warner Bros.'s casting department and then with Friedkin. Pamelyn Ferdin, a veteran of science fiction and supernatural drama, was {{a candidate for the}} role of Regan, but was ultimately turned down because her career thus far had made her too familiar to the public. April Winchell was considered, until she developed pyelonephritis, which caused her to be hospitalized and ultimately taken out of consideration. Denise Nickerson, who played Violet Beauregarde in Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, was considered, but the material troubled her parents too much, and they pulled her out of consideration. Anissa Jones, known for her role as Buffy in <b>Family</b> <b>Affair,</b> auditioned for the role, but she too was rejected, for much the same reason as Ferdin. The part went instead to Blair, a relative unknown until the film's success.|$|E

500|$|A santon (Provençal: [...] "little saint") {{is a small}} hand-painted, {{terracotta}} nativity scene figurine {{produced in}} the Provence region of southeastern France. In a traditional Provençal crèche, the santons represent various characters from Provençal village life such as the scissors grinder, the fishwife, and the chestnut seller. The figurines were first created during the French Revolution when churches were forcibly closed and large nativity scenes prohibited. Today, their production is a <b>family</b> <b>affair</b> passed from parents to children. During the Christmas season, santon makers gather in Marseille and other locales in southeastern France to display and sell their wares.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} to the video was positive. A writer from Singersroom praised it as a [...] "tear jerker", describing it as a [...] "throwback music video" [...] that was appropriate for Valentine's Day. Echoing Singersroom, a writer from SoulBounce called it [...] "a lovey doveymusic video right in time for Valentine's Day". She wrote that the visual was [...] "a <b>family</b> <b>affair</b> {{that will give you}} all the feels," [...] saying that [...] "it's great to get a glimpse at [...] happily ever after". Anthony Chocolate from WDAS-FM called the video [...] "romantic," [...] and Donovan felt that it was [...] "an equally touching affair". Donovan also enjoyed the casting of Zion and Taylor, believing that they [...] "g the video some authenticity".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{attempts}} to broaden their appeal, {{the issue of}} foreigners remained central to the party's rhetoric. Janmaat was convicted of [...] "inciting racial hatred" [...] by the Dutch courts for speaking out against multiculturalism. His conviction later {{came to be seen}} as unwarranted by mainstream observers. Janmaat and Schuurman, who were to marry in 1996, dominated the party. With Schuurman's son head of the party office, the Centre Democrats became almost a <b>family</b> <b>affair.</b> Janmaat remained skeptical of initiatives outside his own control, and expelled multiple local council members from the party. While much of this was due to local cooperationunauthorized by the Centre Democrats leadershipwith the more radical Centre Party '86 (CP'86), Janmaat later agreed to coordinate joint demonstrations with it. The cooperation soon fell apart and Janmaat distanced himself from CP'86 as the 1998 election approached.|$|E

500|$|Rescued by Rover was {{predominantly}} a <b>family</b> <b>affair</b> – Cecil Hepworth's wife, Margaret, {{wrote the}} scenario {{and played the}} role of the mother on screen. Hepworth himself directed, painted the scenery and acted as the father. Their child was the baby on screen, and the part of Rover was played by the family dog, Blair. Two professional actors were paid to appear, Sebastian Smith as the soldier, and his wife as the old woman who stole the baby. The two actors were paid half a guinea each; Hepworth would recall [...] "We couldn't get them for less". The film is often cited as the first film to have used paid actors. Completing the cast was Mabel Clark, who had previously played Alice in Hepworth's version of Alice in Wonderland, as the child's nurse. Clark was also the cutting room assistant.|$|E
500|$|The {{choice of}} Kim Jong-il as Kim Il-sung's {{successor}} met with considerable criticism. Critics accused Kim Il-sung {{of creating a}} dynasty, turning North Korea into a feudal state. An anonymous South Korean critic said, [...] "Hereditary succession of power [...] inevitable consequence of the elder Kim's irrevocable commitment to the dream of founding a dynasty {{of his own and}} of his family", adding that Kim Jong-il's rise to power was proof of the [...] "degeneration" [...] of the WPK into a [...] "thoroughly personalized <b>family</b> <b>affair</b> built up around a personality cult." [...] The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Communist Party of China and other ruling parties of socialist states did not approve Kim Jong-il's appointment as heir apparent. Kim Il-sung's choice of successor arguably concerned the promotion of revolutionary zeal in the country (taking into account the negative treatment Joseph Stalin received from his successor).|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of Departures at the Academy Awards, critic Saburō Kawamoto found the film to show a Japan that the Japanese could relate to, in that, in a nation whose customs put great weight on visits to ancestral graves, a death was always a <b>family</b> <b>affair.</b> [...] He {{believed}} the film had a samurai beauty to it, with its many scenes of families sitting seiza. Critic [...] gave the film a 90% rating, and credited the performances of the two leads {{for much of the}} film's success. [...] He praised its emotional impact and its balance of seriousness and humour, but was more critical of the father–son relationship, which he considered overdone. [...] Maeda attributed the film's international success, despite its heavily Japanese content, to its clear depiction of Japanese views on life and death. He found the film's conceptual scale to have an affinity to that of Hollywood (something he considered lacking in most Japanese films).|$|E

500|$|Fitzsimmons went {{to court}} to {{overturn}} Earp's decision. Newspaper accounts and testimony {{over the next two}} weeks revealed a conspiracy among the boxing promoters to fix the fight's outcome. Newspapers across the United States republished the stories from the San Francisco papers and looked for local angles. On December 14, 1896, the San Francisco Call quoted a story from the New York Journal by Alfred H. Lewis, [...] "who knew the 'bad men' in Arizona. He said that the Earps in Tombstone were [...] "stage robbers" [...] who [...] "stood up stages and plundered express companies for a livelihood... The Earps, Wyatt, Virgil, Warren and Julian, had treated themselves to many a killing... Warren Earp, who was a stage-company guard, meekly put his hands over his head... it was from all standpoints a <b>family</b> <b>affair</b> {{on the part of the}} Earps. Often they got as high as $25,000... Virgil, as marshal, would enlist Wyatt, Warren and Julian, together with Curly Bill, their cousin, and hunt the hold-ups." [...] Earp was parodied in editorial cartoon caricatures by newspapers across the United States.|$|E
