5|$|Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter is {{the final}} id-developed game, {{released}} in December 1991 for MS-DOS. Originally planned to be the third episode of <b>Goodbye,</b> Galaxy and sixth episode overall, it was changed before development began to be a stand-alone game—stylized as Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter!—published as a retail title through FormGen. Due to differing timelines between FormGen and Apogee, despite being numbered as the sixth episode it was developed in between the fourth and fifth; it also features a modified engine from <b>Goodbye,</b> Galaxy.|$|E

5|$|Commander Keen in <b>Goodbye,</b> Galaxy (stylized as <b>Goodbye,</b> Galaxy!) is {{a two-part}} episodic side-scrolling {{platform}} video game developed by id Software {{and published by}} Apogee Software in 1991 for MS-DOS. It consists of the fifth and sixth episodes of the Commander Keen series, though they are numbered as the fourth and fifth, as Commander Keen in Keen Dreams is outside of the main continuity. The game follows the titular Commander Keen, an eight-year-old child genius, as he first journeys through the Shadowlands to rescue the Gnosticenes so they may ask the Oracle how the Shikadi plan to destroy the galaxy, and then through the Shikadi's Armageddon Machine to stop them. The two episodes feature Keen running, jumping, and shooting through various levels while opposed by aliens, robots, and other hazards.|$|E
5|$|During March 2015, Smith sent {{a letter}} to the entire city of Baltimore, announcing that he would test free agency.

5|$|For Vorticons, Carmack {{had created}} {{adaptive}} tile refresh {{to produce a}} scrolling effect on computers not powerful enough to redraw the entire screen when the player moved. For <b>Goodbye,</b> Galaxy, he wanted to scroll the background at a different rate than the foreground, but again computers of the time were not powerful enough to do so smoothly. To implement parallax scrolling without having to manage all of the elements moving past each other, {{he came up with}} a plan to instead save combinations of overlapping foreground and background elements in memory and display the appropriate combination for where Keen was on the screen, so that the game only needed to pick the correct image rather than recalculate what that image would be. Hall, meanwhile, had received feedback from parents who did not like that the enemies in Vorticons left behind corpses instead of disappearing like in other games; he did not want the violence to have no effects, and so in Dreams replaced the raygun with pellets that temporarily stunned enemies. He was not satisfied with this change, and while considering ways to remove Keen's parents during the introduction for <b>Goodbye,</b> Galaxy, came up with a stun gun which would leave behind permanently stunned enemies. Additionally, music, which was not included in prior Keen games, was added to <b>Goodbye,</b> Galaxy, composed by Bobby Prince.|$|E

5|$|Id Software did {{not produce}} any more games in the Commander Keen series after <b>Goodbye</b> Galaxy besides the co-developed Aliens Ate My Babysitter. Another trilogy of episodes, titled The Universe Is Toast, was planned for December 1992, but was {{cancelled}} after the success of id's Wolfenstein 3D and development focus on Doom. A final Keen game, Commander Keen, was developed for the Game Boy Color in 2001 by David A. Palmer Productions in association with id Software, and published by Activision. <b>Goodbye</b> Galaxy has been released as part of several collections since its first release: the id Anthology compilation in 1996, a compilation release by Apogee in 1998 of Invasion of the Vorticons and <b>Goodbye,</b> Galaxy, a similar compilation in 2001 by 3D Realms titled Commander Keen Combo CD, and the 3D Realms Anthology in 2014. They have also been released for modern computers through a DOS emulator, and sold through Steam since 2007 {{as a part of}} the Commander Keen Complete Pack. According to Steam Spy, as of June 2016 approximately 200,000 copies have been sold through Steam.|$|E
