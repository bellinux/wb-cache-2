[...] According to music journalist Charles Shaar Murray, the album [...] "completely changed notions of what a guitar could sound like, or indeed, what music could sound like", while The Miami Herald credited Are You Experienced with introducing acid rock, classic rock, and the guitar aesthetic of heavy metal. Critic Robert Christgau called it a [...] "bombshell debut" [...] in his review for Blender and said its songs were innovative <b>for</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> utilized three-minute pop structures as a medium for Hendrix's unprecedentedly heavy and turbulent guitar and loud, powerful hooks, which greatly appealed to young listeners.|$|E

500|$|Early in 1940, the Paris Group {{decided on}} {{theoretical}} grounds that heavy water {{would be an}} ideal moderator <b>for</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> intended to use it. They asked the French Minister of Armaments to obtain as much heavy water {{as possible from the}} only source, the large Norsk Hydro hydroelectric station at Vemork in Norway. The French then discovered that Germany had already offered to purchase the entire stock of Norwegian heavy water, indicating that Germany might also be researching an atomic bomb. The French told the Norwegian government of the possible military significance of heavy water. Norway gave the entire stock of [...] to a Deuxième Bureau agent, who secretly brought it to France just before Germany invaded Norway in April 1940. On 19 June 1940, following the German invasion of France, it was shipped to England by the Earl of Suffolk and Major Ardale Golding, aboard the steamer [...] The heavy water, valued at £22,000, was initially kept at HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs, and was later secretly stored in the library at Windsor Castle. The Paris Group moved to Cambridge, with the exception of Joliot-Curie, who remained in France and became active in the French Resistance.|$|E

Initially, the band {{did not have a}} clear plan <b>for</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> would release the material being written. At the time, Clayton said, [...] "I don't know if what we're doing here is the next U2 album or a bunch of rough sketches that in two years will turn into the demos for the next U2 album." [...] The Edge was a proponent of making an EP of new material to promote the upcoming leg of the tour, describing his mentality as thus: [...] "We've got a bit of time off. We've got some ideas hanging around from the last record, let's do an EP, maybe four new songs to spice the next phase of the tour up a bit. It'll be a fan thing. It'll be cool." ...|$|E
500|$|Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik was {{a seminal}} album for Southern hip hop. During the early 1990s, {{the scene was}} largely discredited {{by the rest of}} the hip hop {{community}} as misogynistic and inferior to other scenes, particularly East Coast and West Coast hip hop. Those scenes dominated the hip hop market, and acts from other regional scenes were often produced by either East Coast or West Coast producers. The album offered an artistically credible alternative, both musically and lyrically, to those regional scenes and was produced by an Atlanta-based production team. Music journalist T. Hasan Johnson notes [...] "Outkast's first submission to the music industry" [...] as significant <b>for</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> [...] "broke from the binary production options split by California and New York artists", viewing that their decision to boast their region and a native production team [...] "signaled a break from the conventional split between East and West hip hop aesthetics and openly demonstrated that the South could produce street-certified, quality music." [...] Nicole Hodges Persley cites its release as a critical moment in hip hop and writes that it [...] "marked a break in bicoastal hip hop sound".|$|E

While driving with Brian and using his feet on the steering wheel, Peter crashes into a young woman's car, leading Brian to ensure she is okay. The woman apologizes to Brian, and he asks her out. She accepts, but when he comes to her house to pick her up, her mother Rita says she has just left with somebody else. Brian keeps talking to Rita and finds himself attracted to her. After dating for several weeks, they sneak into the Griffin home late one night, but the family finds out the next morning and ridicules Rita behind her back. [...] Brian attempts to convince the family that Rita is a wonderful, charming woman despite the fact that she's significantly older than he is, and invites her to dinner to prove his point. It doesn't go well: they demand that she reveal her age, and she breaks down and admits that she's 50. Infuriated with the Griffins, Brian goes to console Rita, and proposes to her.

500|$|They {{met with}} Katzenberg {{at a conference}} table in the Team Disney {{building}} at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank. Catmull and Smith considered {{it would be difficult}} to keep Katzenberg interested in working with the company over time. They considered it even more difficult to sell Lasseter and the junior animators on the idea of working with Disney, who had a bad reputation <b>for</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> treated their animators, and Katzenberg, who had built a reputation as a micromanaging tyrant. Katzenberg asserted this himself in the meeting: [...] "Everybody thinks I'm a tyrant. I am a tyrant. But I'm usually right." [...] He threw out the idea of a half-hour special and eyed Lasseter as the key talent in the room: [...] "John, since you won't come work for me, I'm going to make it work this way." [...] He invited the six visitors to mingle with the animators—"ask them anything at all"—and the men did so, finding they all backed up Katzenberg's statements. Lasseter felt he would be able to work with Disney and the two companies began negotiations. Pixar at this time was on the verge of bankruptcy and needed a deal with Disney. Katzenberg insisted that Disney be given the rights to Pixar's proprietary technology for making 3-D animation, but Jobs refused. In another case, Jobs demanded Pixar would have part ownership of the film and its characters, sharing control of both video rights and sequels, but Katzenberg refused. Disney and Pixar reached accord on contract terms in an agreement dated May 3, 1991, and signed on in early July. Eventually, the deal specified that Disney would own the picture and its characters outright, have creative control, and pay Pixar about 12.5% of the ticket revenues. It had the option (but not the obligation) to do Pixar's next two films and the right to make (with or without Pixar) sequels using the characters in the film. Disney could also kill the film at any time with only a small penalty. These early negotiations would become a point of contention between Jobs and Eisner for many years.|$|E
