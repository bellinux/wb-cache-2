5|$|The {{density of}} indium, 7.31g/cm3, is also greater than gallium, but lower than thallium. Below the {{critical}} temperature, 3.41K, indium becomes a superconductor. At standard temperature and pressure, indium crystallizes in the face-centered tetragonal crystal {{system in the}} space group I4/mmm (lattice parameters:a=325pm, c=495pm): this is a slightly distorted face-centered cubic structure, where each indium atom has four neighbours at 324pm distance and eight neighbours slightly further (336pm). Indium displays a ductile viscoplastic response, found to be size-independent in tension and compression. However {{it does have a}} size effect <b>in</b> <b>bending</b> and indentation, associated to a length-scale of order 50–100µm, significantly large when compared with other metals.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{proteins}} that bind DNA are well-understood examples of non-specific DNA-protein interactions. Within chromosomes, DNA {{is held in}} complexes with structural proteins. These proteins organize the DNA into a compact structure called chromatin. In eukaryotes, this structure involves DNA binding to a complex of small basic proteins called histones, while in prokaryotes multiple types of proteins are involved. The histones form a disk-shaped complex called a nucleosome, which contains two complete turns of double-stranded DNA wrapped around its surface. These non-specific interactions are formed through basic residues in the histones, making ionic bonds to the acidic sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA, and are thus largely independent of the base sequence. Chemical modifications of these basic amino acid residues include methylation, phosphorylation, and acetylation. These chemical changes alter {{the strength of the}} interaction between the DNA and the histones, making the DNA more or less accessible to transcription factors and changing the rate of transcription. Other non-specific DNA-binding proteins in chromatin include the high-mobility group proteins, which bind to bent or distorted DNA. These proteins are important <b>in</b> <b>bending</b> arrays of nucleosomes and arranging them into the larger structures that make up chromosomes.|$|E

25|$|A typical plywood {{panel has}} face veneers {{of a higher}} grade than the core veneers. The {{principal}} function of the core layers {{is to increase the}} separation between the outer layers where the bending stresses are highest, thus increasing the panel's resistance to bending. As a result, thicker panels can span greater distances under the same loads. <b>In</b> <b>bending,</b> the maximum stress occurs in the outermost layers, one in tension, the other in compression. Bending stress decreases from the maximum at the face layers to nearly zero at the central layer. Shear stress, by contrast, is higher {{in the center of the}} panel, and at the outer fibres.|$|E
25|$|On July 17, 1864, {{just before}} the Battle of Peachtree Creek on July 20, 1864, Confederate President Jefferson Davis {{replaced}} General Joseph E. Johnston as commander of the Army of Tennessee defending Atlanta with the aggressive Lieutenant General, temporary General, John Bell Hood. On July 22, 1864, Hood ordered Lieutenant General Hardee to maneuver around the left flank of the Union Army east of Atlanta for a surprise attack while Major General Cheatham, then in command of Hood's former corps, {{was to make a}} diversionary attack {{on the front of the}} Union force and the cavalry commander, Major General Joseph Wheeler, would attack their supply line. The Battle of Atlanta, fought east and south of the city and near the Union supply lines further east at Decatur, Georgia, ensued. During a hard day of fighting after a night march to get into position, Hardee's men succeeded <b>in</b> <b>bending</b> back the Union left flank and retaking some breastworks that had been built by the Confederates earlier. Union Major General James B. McPherson, who was killed during the battle, anticipated the Confederate maneuver against the far end of his flank, reshaped his line and sent reinforcements to the flank.|$|E

2500|$|City {{or urban}} blues styles were more codified and elaborate, as a {{performer}} was no longer within their local, immediate community, and had {{to adapt to a}} larger, more varied audience's aesthetic. Classic female urban and vaudeville blues singers were popular in the 1920s, among them [...] "the big three"—Gertrude [...] "Ma" [...] Rainey, Bessie Smith, and Lucille Bogan—and Victoria Spivey. Mamie Smith, more a vaudeville performer than a blues artist, was the first African American to record a blues song in 1920; her second record, [...] "Crazy Blues", sold 75,000 copies in its first month. Ma Rainey, the [...] "Mother of Blues", and Bessie Smith each [...] " [...] around center tones, perhaps in order to project her voice more easily to the back of a room". Smith would [...] "sing a song in an unusual key, and her artistry <b>in</b> <b>bending</b> and stretching notes with her beautiful, powerful contralto to accommodate her own interpretation was unsurpassed".|$|E
2500|$|Historically, women's bicycle frames had a {{top tube}} that {{connected}} {{in the middle}} of the seat tube instead of the top, resulting in a lower standover height at the expense of compromised structural integrity, since this places a strong bending load in the seat tube, and bicycle frame members are typically weak <b>in</b> <b>bending.</b> This design, referred to as a step-through frame or as an open frame, allows the rider to mount and dismount in a dignified way while wearing a skirt or dress. While some women's bicycles continue to use this frame style, there is also a variation, the mixte, which splits the top tube laterally into two thinner top tubes that bypass the seat tube on each side and connect to the rear fork ends. The ease of stepping through is also appreciated by those with limited flexibility or other joint problems. Because of its persistent image as a [...] "women's" [...] bicycle, step-through frames are not common for larger frames.|$|E

2500|$|Li Bai had {{a strong}} sense of himself as being part of a poetic tradition. The [...] "genius" [...] of Li Bai, says one recent account, [...] "lies at once in his total command of the {{literary}} tradition before him and his ingenuity <b>in</b> <b>bending</b> (without breaking) it to discover a uniquely personal idiom...." [...] Burton Watson, comparing him to Du Fu, says Li's poetry, [...] "is essentially backward-looking, that it represents more a revival and fulfillment of past promises and glory than a foray into the future." [...] Watson adds, as evidence, that of all the poems attributed to Li Bai, about one sixth are in the form of yuefu, or, in other words, reworked lyrics from traditional folk ballads. As further evidence, Watson cites the existence of a fifty-nine poem collection by Li Bai entitled Gu Feng, or In the Old Manner, [...] which is, in part, tribute to the poetry of the Han and Wei dynasties. His admiration for certain particular poets is also shown through specific allusions, for example to Qu Yuan or Tao Yuanming, and occasionally by name, for example Du Fu.|$|E
2500|$|Often such buildings, {{especially}} if constructed on a moderate slope, are erected {{on a platform}} connected to a perimeter foundation through low stud-walls called [...] "cripple wall" [...] or pin-up. This low wall structure itself may fail in shear or in its connections to itself at the corners, leading to the building moving diagonally and collapsing the low walls. The likelihood of failure of the pin-up can be reduced by ensuring that the corners are well reinforced in shear and that the shear panels are well connected to {{each other through the}} corner posts. This requires structural grade sheet plywood, often treated for rot resistance. This grade of plywood is made without interior unfilled knots and with more, thinner layers than common plywood. New buildings designed to resist earthquakes will typically use OSB (oriented strand board), sometimes with metal joins between panels, and with well attached stucco covering to enhance its performance. In many modern tract homes, especially those built upon expansive (clay) soil the building is constructed upon a single and relatively thick monolithic slab, kept in one piece by high tensile rods that are stressed after the slab has set. This poststressing places the concrete under compression – a condition under which it is extremely strong <b>in</b> <b>bending</b> and so will not crack under adverse soil conditions.|$|E
