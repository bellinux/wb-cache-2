5|$|The {{music video}} sees Little Mix {{adopting}} a new heavier look including leather outfits, bullet chains and gothic makeup, and explores themes of jealousy and obsession. It features the group hunting down {{men who have}} wronged them. Filmed in comic book movie style, Little Mix play female assassins who stalk and then kidnap men they are obsessed with. In one scene, Perrie Edwards is angrily driving a car while next to a male passenger who is bound and gagged. Edwards sports glossy red lipstick and a biker jacket, keeping <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> the road and paying no mind to the camera as wind blows through her hair. Jade Thirlwall is seen stalking a man outside his bedroom window. Standing outside the window ledge, Thirlwall spies on a man who captured her heart. Thirlwall wears metallic silver and black striped highwaisted trousers, with a white shirt, black bow tie and braces. Jesy Nelson's scene {{is similar to that}} of Edwards. Nelson races to her destination in a vintage convertible with a lace visor covering her eyes as police sirens flash behind her. In another scene, Leigh-Anne Pinnock masterminds the story's plots in a secret room with a wall of evidence the group has compiled, of which includes maps and clippings.|$|E
25|$|Surmounted on {{the main}} altar is a {{beautiful}} statue of St. Lucy holding up <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> {{the palm of her}} hand. The exquisite stained glass windows when lit by sunlight create a panorama of colour further enhancing the transepts of the church. In a far corner of the church is a circular Baptismal Font of white marble carved with cherubs, and crowned by a statue of John the Baptist. On going up the narrow staircase that leads to the choir loft, one encounters 'Anthony Thomas', an enormous bell weighing 4300lbs. The bell has intricate engravings of elaborate floral wreaths and holy figures and symbols of Christianity, and it is the largest of the four bells shipped from Marseilles and christened at the cathedral in 1903. The choir loft also contains a unique pipe organ donated to the cathedral in 1934.|$|E

She saves him and becomes jealous of Ustane. [...] The latter is ordered to leave Leo and never to set <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> him again. Ustane refuses, however, and Ayesha eventually strikes her dead with magic. Despite the murder of their friend, Holly and Leo cannot free themselves from the power of Ayesha's beauty and Leo becomes bewitched. In explaining her history, Ayesha shows Leo the perfectly preserved body of Kallikrates, which she has kept with her, but she then dissolves the remains with a powerful acid, confident that Leo is indeed the reincarnation of her former lover.|$|E

500|$|Marta Hoelsher of Technorati Media said: [...] "The biggest news {{of season}} two, though, is the {{appearance}} of Donna Mills as Abby Cunningham, the blonde bombshell who wreaks havoc all through the neighborhood. With {{the appearance of}} Abby, things really started to heat up and get interesting. No marriage is off limits when Abby sets <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> it. Played to perfection by Donna Mills, Abby is wicked, vicious, bitchy, and heartless enough to keep us loving and hating her for years. Abby's clashes with Karen MacKenzie and Val were legendary, and season two gets things rolling. After a fairly peaceful start to the season, we start to see {{the beginnings of the}} rivalry that defines the show for years: [...] Karen vs. Abby. [...] It's fun watching their early friendship evolve into a bitter rivalry." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{her first}} appearance, Abby meets and marries Jeff Cunningham. They move to San Luis Obispo, California, and have two children, Olivia and Brian. When she and Jeff divorce, Abby moves to San Diego. [...] On {{the way she}} stops to visit her brother, Sid, and decides to stay in Knots Landing. She rents a house on Seaview Circle, and has an affair with Richard Avery. [...] Abby soon sets <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> {{neighbor}} Gary Ewing, which becomes obvious after she starts working as a bookkeeper for Knots Landing Motors. She and Gary get the company involved with the mob, which results in her brother Sid's death. At the same time, Jeff kidnaps her children. She eventually gets them back. Abby and Gary go into a methanol business together and start an affair. Valene finds out and kicks Gary out, so he moves in with Abby. Gary soon inherits millions from his father Jock Ewing's death. Abby uses the money to manipulate those around her, and Gary starts drinking again. Gary sobers up and buys a ranch, similar to Southfork, the ranch his family owns. They move there and marry.|$|E
500|$|When {{she first}} arrived in Genoa City, Angelina set <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart), whom she {{developed}} a huge crush on. Of her crazy crush, DeGarmo said: [...] "Ooh, she wants him bad! Angie has her eyes, her heart and her body set on landing Kevin â€” and it scares him to death." [...] She said that Kevin was too sweet and nervous, and is weakened to Angelina's preying on him. [...] "She loves seeing him squirm" [...] DeGarmo stated. Of working with Rikaart, she said: [...] "Greg and I can't stop laughing during our scenes together." [...] During an interview with MSN, she stated: [...] "I've had the great pleasure sharing the screen with Mr. Greg Rikaart. Angelina gets {{a little bit of}} a crush on Kevin, and she's not afraid not to show it. It's a blast, because she makes him incredibly nervous [...] The sparks that fly on screen are just hilarious. It's wonderful to be a part of." [...] Just before Kevin was set to marry his girlfriend Chloe Mitchell (Elizabeth Hendrickson), Angelina persuaded him to help her escape town, as she was in danger. They returned home safe.|$|E

500|$|Most of {{the fifth}} chapter of the Bala Kanda Book of the Adhyatma Ramayana (embedded in the Brahmanda Purana, c. 14th century) is {{dedicated}} to the Ahalya episode. Like most other versions of the story, Ahalya is turned into stone and advised to engross herself in meditation of Rama, [...] "the Supreme Lord". When Rama touches the stone with his foot on Vishvamitra's advice, Ahalya rises as a beautiful maiden and sings a long panegyric dedicated to Rama. She describes his iconographic form and exalts him as an avatar of Vishnu and source of the universe to whom many divinities pay their respects. After worshipping him, she returns to Gautama. At the end of the narrative, Ahalya's hymn is prescribed as an ideal benediction for a devotee to gain Rama's favour. The Awadhi Ramacharitamanasa (16th century) drops the narrative of Indra's visit to Ahalya. In this epic, Vishvamitra tells Rama that the cursed Ahalya has assumed the form of a rock and is patiently awaiting the dust from Rama's feet. Ahalya tells Rama that Gautama was right to pronounce the curse, and she deems it as the greatest favour, for as a result, she feasted <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> Rama, who liberated her from her worldly existence. As in the Adhyatma Ramayana, Ahalya lauds Rama as the great Lord served by other divinities, asks for the boon of eternal engrossment in his devotion and afterwards leaves for her husband's abode. The narrative ends with praise for Rama's compassion. Tulsidas alludes to this episode numerous times in the Ramacharitamanasa while highlighting the significance of Rama's benevolence. Commenting on this narrative in the Ramacharitamanasa, Rambhadracharya says that Rama destroyed three things: the sin of Ahalya by his sight, the curse by the dust of his feet and the affliction by the touch of his feet, evidenced by the use of the Tribhangi (meaning [...] "destroyer of the three") metre in the verses which form Ahalya's panegyric.|$|E
