5|$|As Neerja boards Pan Am 73, it is {{revealed}} that the Abu Nidal organization, a Libyan-sponsored terrorist group, plans to <b>hijack</b> the plane in Karachi. The plane takes off from Mumbai's Sahar International Airport and lands in Karachi, where the four Abu Nidal terrorists, disguised as security officers escorting a Libyan diplomat, <b>hijack</b> the plane. Neerja quickly alerts the cockpit, and the three American pilots escape through the overhead hatch, fleeing to the terminal under fire from the hijackers. The American pilots had {{just enough time to}} escape, as the hijackers did not realize that the cockpit of a Boeing 747 is located upstairs.|$|E

The second part of this thesis provides an overview the offence of aircraft <b>hijacking,</b> providing the foundation for this thesis. This part defines and introduces the terminology of aircraft <b>hijacking,</b> the relationship between <b>hijacking</b> and aerial terrorism, the categories of aerial terrorism, a comparative analysis of the concept of aircraft <b>hijacking,</b> the historic evolution of <b>hijacking,</b> and the present situation and characters of <b>hijacking.</b> Next, the third part will conduct a comprehensive study of the international Conventions available for combating <b>hijacking,</b> including the Tokyo Convention, The Hague Convention and the Montreal Convention. The fourth part will study domestic laws available for combating aircraft <b>hijacking,</b> including those of the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Canada, France, the Russian Federation, and the People's Republic of China. Finally, the fifth part of this thesis will analyze the concerted enforcement of international Conventions for combating <b>hijacking...</b>|$|R

30|$|<b>Hijacking</b> JavaScript functions: To {{keep track}} of events on each state, D-ForenRIA <b>hijacks</b> several {{corresponding}} JavaScript methods. This includes overriding methods such as setTimeout, setInterval, etc. One may wonder whether this overriding interferes with the RIA if the RIA itself <b>hijacks</b> these methods. To mitigate this issues, D-ForenRIA’s <b>hijacking</b> mechanism is executed after possible <b>hijacking</b> codes executed, and it includes the RIA’s code for the <b>hijacked</b> method. In other words, D-ForenRIA first executes the application’s code for the JavaScript event (such as setTimeout) and then instruments its required code. This approach guarantees execution of the RIA’s code before the code required by D-ForenRIA.|$|R

40|$|BGP prefix <b>hijacking</b> is {{a serious}} {{security}} threat on the Internet. In this {{paper we propose a}} region-based BGP announcement filtering scheme (RBF) to improve the BGP security. In contrast to existing solutions that indifferently prevent or detect prefix <b>hijacking</b> attacks, RBF enables differentiated AS and prefix filtering treatment and blends prefix <b>hijacking</b> prevention with deterrence. RBF is a light-weight BGP security scheme that provides strong incremental deployment incentive and better prefix <b>hijacking</b> deterrence. Experimental studies based on real Internet numbers allocation information and BGP traces show that RBF is a feasible and effective scheme in improving BGP security. For example, on the days without known BGP prefix <b>hijacking</b> attacks, {{only a small number of}} BGP announcements will be flagged as attacks. Importantly, by applying RBF to known BGP prefix <b>hijacking</b> attacks, we show that RBF can detect and filter both large-scale and smallscale BGP prefix <b>hijacking</b> attacks even if only a single prefix is <b>hijacked...</b>|$|R

40|$|Research Area : Networking and communicationResearch Topics: Computer Networks, Internet SecurityIP prefix <b>hijacking</b> {{is known}} as one of the top {{security}} threats targeting today's Internet routing infrastructure. Several schemes have been proposed to either detect or mitigate prefix <b>hijacking</b> events. However, none of these approaches is adopted and deployed in large-scale on the Internet due to reasons such as scalability, economical practicality, or unrealistic assumptions about the collaborations among ISPs. As a result, there is lack of actionable and deployable solutions for dealing with prefix <b>hijacking.</b> In this paper, we study key issues related to deploying and operating an IP prefix <b>hijacking</b> detection and mitigation system. Our contributions include (i) deployment strategies for <b>hijacking</b> detection and mitigation system (named as TOWERDEFENSE) : a practical service model for prefix <b>hijacking</b> protection and effective algorithms for selecting agent locations for detecting and mitigating prefix <b>hijacking</b> attacks; and (ii) large scale experiments on PlanetLab and extensive analysis on the performance of TOWERDEFENSE. We demonstrate that, by using only a few agents, TOWERDEFENSE can detect and mitigate prefix <b>hijacking</b> with up to 99. 8 % and 98. 2 % success ratios respectively...|$|R

5|$|Players can use {{a variety}} of weapons to fight enemies. The game {{features}} a large arsenal of weapons, from two-handed pistols to rocket launchers, and a variety of sea, land and air vehicles. Players can drive them, jump on top of them or hide in front of them while they are moving and <b>hijack</b> enemy vehicles, triggering a series of quick-time events. Initially, the player must acquire weapons and vehicles in the field. Early in the game, they encounter a black market supplier from whom weapons and vehicles can be purchased (with optional delivery to the player's location by helicopter). As more chaos points are gained, additional weapons, vehicles and an extraction option become available on the black market. All black-market weapons and vehicles can be upgraded in steps with weapon and vehicle components in the game world; over 2,000 parts may be acquired. Players use a beacon to access the market.|$|E
