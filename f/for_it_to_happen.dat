Urb mentioned that he learned the video game Leon's mannerisms from watching clips posted on YouTube, commenting that [...] "he doesn't have a high-pitched voice.

500|$|In early 2011, Christian Svensson at Capcom {{said that}} there were no plans at the time to release Ace Attorney Investigations 2 in regions outside Japan, due to higher {{localization}} costs than estimated returns; according to Eshiro, however, the main reason for the lack of a localization was scheduling, as all the staff working on the game had disbanded and moved to different teams after finishing the game, and were unable to work on a localization.

He exploits this to make his latest attempt to kill Bart legally over state lines, but is foiled again and gets taken away by state police. Bob briefly appears in [...] "At Long Last Leave" [...] (season 23, 2012), where he attends a town meeting to decide if the Simpson family should be banished from Springfield, {{and is one of}} many who express their desire <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> In [...] "The Man Who Grew Too Much" [...] (season 25, 2014), he was revealed as a Chief Scientist for a genetic engineering company named Monsarno, having received the position after he was selected as a test subject and published the results of the experiments to which he was subjected. He and Lisa bond over their interest in Walt Whitman, but Bob soon reveals that he has also genetically modified himself to give himself various superhuman abilities, intending to acquire DNA from the relics of various historical figures stored in the Springfield Museum to make himself a superhuman dictator. However, after he is provoked into a fight, he realizes that he has become a crude monster and jumps off the Springfield Dam, surviving because the gills he gave himself allow him to survive in the lake.|$|E

40|$|From late 1945 {{through the}} middle of 1946, Hungary {{experienced}} the most gigantic inflation of modern history. But in August 1946, the astronomical price increases stopped, and lasting price stability followed. Indeed, the contrast is so dramatic that it is viewed by some as an economic miracle surpassing even the post-war German Wirschaftswunder. On the surface, the Hungarian hyperinflation, which witnessed a depreciation of the currency unit, the pengo of about 10 - 27, seems a kind of madness that raises two interlinked questions: First, how could such a fantastic destruction in the value of a currency take place, and second, what possible motive could anyone have for creating this inflation or at least <b>for</b> allowing <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen...</b>|$|R
