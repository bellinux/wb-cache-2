Sarah allows Little Bee to stay with her, intent on helping her become a legal British citizen. Lawrence, who is still involved with Sarah, disapproves of her actions and contemplates turning Little Bee in to the police. When he informs Little Bee that he is considering this, she responds that allowing her to stay would be {{what is best for}} Sarah, so if Lawrence turns her in, Little Bee will get revenge by telling his wife Linda about his affair. The two reach an uneasy truce. After spending several days together, Sarah, Lawrence, Little Bee and Charlie take a trip to the park. Charlie goes missing, and Little Bee calls the police while Sarah searches for him. Although he is quickly found, the police become suspicious of Little Bee, and discover that she is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>illegally.</b>|$|E

3000|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, a registry-based {{random sample}} has limitations {{that are relevant}} for {{the selection of the}} migrant population. For example, persons who have recently moved and have not yet registered at their new place of residence cannot be covered by the register. This is particularly relevant for migrants in Germany, {{who are most likely to}} be unfamiliar with the practice of registration (Salentin 2014). In certain circumstances, moves from one municipality to another are reported only with considerable delay, or only if proof of current residence is required for other purposes. In addition, some migrants fail to deregister with their local registration office when they permanently return to their country of origin. In consequence, <b>in</b> some cases, <b>the</b> addresses of selected individuals are no longer current (Martin et al. 2015). Moreover, migrants may be residing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> host <b>country</b> <b>illegally.</b> According to an estimate provided by the Hamburgisches Weltwirtschaftsinstitut (2010), 3 the proportion of illegal immigrants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> target population <b>in</b> Germany at <b>the</b> time of sample selection in PIAAC Germany was approximately [...]. 5 %.

25|$|The law prohibits {{all forms}} of {{trafficking}} in persons; however, {{there were reports that}} persons were trafficked to, from, through, and within <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> Women from Russia, other <b>countries</b> of <b>the</b> former Soviet Union, China, Mongolia, the Philippines, and other Southeast Asian countries were trafficked to <b>the</b> <b>country</b> for sexual exploitation and domestic servitude. They were recruited personally or answered advertisements and were flown to Korea, often with entertainer or tourist visas. In some instances, once these visa recipients arrived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> employers <b>illegally</b> held victims' passports. In addition some foreign women recruited for legal and brokered marriages with Korean men ended up in situations of sexual exploitation, debt bondage, and involuntary servitude once married. Korean women were trafficked primarily for sexual exploitation to the United States, sometimes through Canada and Mexico, as well as to other countries, such as Australia and Japan. Relatively small numbers of migrants seeking opportunities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> were believed to have become victims of trafficking as well, although the MOL Employment Permit System reduced the number of workers trafficked into <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> There were reports that human traffickers exploited ROK passports for the purpose of human trafficking.

5|$|As in all {{occupied}} {{countries in}} Europe, food, fuel and clothing were strictly rationed by the German authorities. Even with the stringent rationing, {{the food and}} materials which civilians should officially have been entitled to were not always available. A significant black market also existed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> supplying food <b>illegally</b> at very high prices to those that could afford it. Information and the press were strictly controlled by the German government and news was greatly restricted. Nevertheless, the sales of collaborationist newspapers like Le Soir and the newspapers of pro-collaborationist political parties like Le Pays Réel remained high. A large number of underground newspapers were also published and distributed – the underground paper La Libre Belgique achieved a circulation of 30,000.|$|R

25|$|Ironically, as Corey's {{politics}} {{turned against}} his Stalinist beliefs, he ran {{afoul of the}} Federal prosecutors. In December 1950, Corey was served with a deportation warrant from the US Department of Justice charging {{that he had been}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>illegally</b> almost his entire life and for being a Communist. His father had come to the United States without obtaining naturalization papers and young Louis had decided against filing later due to his 1917 conviction as a conscientious objector.

Margarita did claim {{that she and her}} family had searched for her daughter but were unable to locate her, for which she became the subject of much criticism and anger when Anjelica was identified in 2013. Other reports reveal that her family also neglected to report her missing, as some of the family members, including Margarita, were apparently illegal immigrants. They feared that if it was discovered that some were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>illegally</b> during the course of an investigation, they would be deported.|$|E
40|$|The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is a {{multilateral}} international treaty designed to effectively govern {{the return of}} children abducted (often by a parent) and taken to a foreign country. In most cases, if the “left-behind” parent applies for relief under the Convention {{within a year of}} the abduction, the child must be returned to <b>the</b> <b>country</b> of origin for a custody hearing. If, however, the application for return is made more than one year after abduction and the child is now “well-settled” in their new environment, the application may be denied under the well-settled affirmative defense provided by Article 12 of the Convention. The Convention does not, however, specify which factors are to be considered in a well-settled determination, and courts have frequently grappled with how immigration status (particularly, whether the abducting parent and child are living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new <b>country</b> <b>illegally)</b> should impact <b>the</b> determination. U. S. and international courts have adopted one of three approaches to the issue: granting immigration status considerable weight <b>in</b> <b>the</b> determination, treating immigration status as {{one of a number of}} equally weighted factors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> determination, or granting immigration status considerably little weight <b>in</b> <b>the</b> determination. This Note addresses this conflict and concludes that courts should generally accord immigration status little weight, except where uncertain immigration status is likely to affect the child’s future prospects, irrespective of a deportation risk...|$|R

500|$|Some legal scholars, {{opposed to}} the idea that jus soli should apply to the {{children}} of illegal aliens, have argued that the Wong Kim Ark precedent does not apply when alien parents are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>illegally.</b> [...] John C. Eastman, a former dean of the Chapman University School of Law, has argued that Wong Kim Ark does not entitle U.S.-born children of illegal aliens to gain automatic citizenship because, in his opinion, being subject to the jurisdiction of the United States requires a status of [...] "full and complete jurisdiction" [...] that does not apply to aliens who are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>illegally.</b> [...] Eastman further argues that the Wong Kim Ark decision was fundamentally flawed in the way it dealt with the concept of jurisdiction, and that the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924—which followed Wong Kim Ark—would not have been necessary if Congress had believed [...] "that the Citizenship Clause confers citizenship merely by accident of birth." [...] A similar analysis of the jurisdiction question has been proposed by Professor Peter H. Schuck of the Yale School of Law and Rogers M. Smith, political science professor at Yale. According to law professor Lino Graglia of the University of Texas, even if Wong Kim Ark settled the status of children of legal residents, it did not do so for children of illegal residents; Graglia asserts that the case weighs against automatic birthright for illegal immigrants because the Court denied such citizenship for an analogous group, namely [...] "children of alien enemies, born during and within their hostile occupation". [...] Richard Posner, a judge of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, has also criticized the granting of citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants, suggesting that Congress can and should act to change this policy. [...] Charles Wood, former counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on immigration, has also opposed the practice, urging (in 1999) that it be stopped as quickly as possible, either by an act of Congress or a constitutional amendment.|$|E
500|$|In {{the words}} of a 2007 legal {{analysis}} of events following the Wong Kim Ark decision, [...] "The parameters of the jus soli principle, as stated by the court in Wong Kim Ark, have never been seriously questioned by the Supreme Court, and have been accepted as dogma by lower courts." [...] A 2010 review {{of the history of the}} Citizenship Clause notes that the Wong Kim Ark decision held that the guarantee of birthright citizenship [...] "applies to children of foreigners present on American soil" [...] and states that the Supreme Court [...] "has not re-examined this issue since the concept of 'illegal alien' entered the language". [...] Since the 1990s, however, controversy has arisen over the longstanding practice of granting automatic citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants, and legal scholars disagree over whether the Wong Kim Ark precedent applies when alien parents are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>illegally.</b> Attempts have been made from time to time in Congress to restrict birthright citizenship, either via statutory redefinition of the term jurisdiction, or by overriding both the Wong Kim Ark ruling and the Citizenship Clause itself through an amendment to the Constitution, but no such proposal has been enacted.|$|E

In a 2006 National Center for School Engagement report, Susana Herrera, the program coordinator for Houston's Truancy Reduction Demonstration Project, indicated that social service agencies and government officials estimated Gulfton's population to be 60,000, with 20,000 juveniles.

Jaime de la Isla, the assistant superintendent of the Houston Independent School District, said in 2000 that it was possible that the district lost significant amounts of money because residents of Gulfton were not counted in the 1990 United States Census, and that the district receives federal funds for bilingual programs, free and reduced lunch, and special education based on numbers in the U.S. census. Steve Murdock, a demographer for the state of Texas, said that [...] "he major problem in an undercount is not an immigration issue.
