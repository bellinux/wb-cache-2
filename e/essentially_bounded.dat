40|$|International students’ {{connectedness}} {{with their}} peers, {{institutions and the}} broader community significantly affects their learning and wellbeing.

This paper analyses the motives and nature of international students’ intercultural connectedness. It is based on a study that includes more than 150 interviews and fieldwork with international students and staff from 25 vocational education colleges in Australia. Drawing on Blumer’s symbolic interactionism theory as a conceptual framework, the study found international students’ motivation to engage in intercultural connectedness is linked to not only their desire for respect and recognition for intellectual, cultural and linguistic capacities and diversities but also for employment aspirations. The research shows various dimensions in which intercultural engagement is seen to encompass not only empathy, sociability and equity but also employability.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a phase space error control, {{which is a}} generalisation of the error control rst proposed in [8]. Variable time-stepping algorithms for initial value ordinary dierential equations are traditionally designed {{to solve a problem}} for a xed initial condition and over a nite time. It can be shown that these algorithms may perform poorly for long time computations which pass through a small neighbourhood of a xed point. In this regime there are orbits that are bounded in space but unbounded in time, and the classical error-per-step or error-per-unit-step philosophy may be improved upon. A new error criterion is introduced that <b>essentially</b> <b>bounds</b> the truncation error at each step by a fraction of the solution arc length over the corresponding time interval. This new control can be incorporated within a standard algorithm as an additional constraint at negligible additional computational cost.

Thirty children (6 - 11 years) performed a novel EAM test.

Executive functions, and episodic and personal semantic memory were assessed. Results showed that recent autobiographical memories (AMs) were mainly episodic, unlike remote ones. An age-related increase in the indices of episodicity and specific spontaneity for recent AMs was mainly mediated by an age-related increase in {{the efficiency of the}} three cognitive abilities. Remote AMs varied only slightly with age (overall spontaneity), reflecting improvements in semantic abilities.

40|$|Memory {{management}} {{is a critical}} issue in stream processing involving stateful operators such as join. Traditionally, the memory requirement for a stream join is query-driven: a query has to explicitly define a window for each (potentially unbounded) input. The window <b>essentially</b> <b>bounds</b> {{the size of the}} buffer allocated for that stream. However, outputs produced by such approach may not be desirable (if the window size {{is not part of the}} intended query semantic) due to the volatile input characteristics. We discover that when streams are ordered or partially ordered, it is possible to use a data-driven memory management scheme for improved performance. In this work, we present a novel data-driven memory management scheme, called Window-Oblivious Join (WO-Join), which adaptively adjusts the state buffer size according to the input characteristics. Our performance study shows that, compared to traditional Window-Join (W-Join), WO-Join is more robust with respect to the dynamic inputs and therefore produces higher quality results with lower memory costs. 1...|$|R
