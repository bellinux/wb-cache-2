5000|$|<b>Flightstop</b> - Toronto Eaton Centre a {{collection}} of life sized Canada geese in flight hanging over the main section of the mall. In 1982, the installation {{was the subject of}} a leading Canadian court decision on moral rights, Snow v. The Eaton Centre Ltd.|$|E
50|$|Michael Snow was {{commissioned}} to do a sculpture called <b>Flightstop</b> {{consisting of a}} number of Canada geese in flight in the atrium of the Toronto Eaton Centre. During the Christmas season of 1981 the Eaton Centre placed red ribbons around the necks of the geese. Snow brought an action against the Centre to get an injunction to have the ribbons removed. He had argued that the ribbons offended the integrity of, and distorted, his work.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{success of}} an {{aircraft}} mission {{is subject to}} the fulfillment ofsome operational requirements before and during each flight. As theserequirements depend essentially on the aircraft system components and themission profile, the effects of failures can be very significant if they are notanticipated. Hence, one should be able to assess the aircraft operationalreliability with regard to its missions {{in order to be able}} to cope with failures. This paper addresses aircrafts operational reliability modeling to supportmaintenance planning during the mission achievement. We develop a modelingapproach to represent the aircraft system operational state taking into accountthe mission profile as well as the maintenance facilities available at the <b>flightstop</b> locations involved in the mission. It is illustrated using Stochastic ActivityNetworks (SANs) formalism, based on an aircraft subsystem...|$|E
