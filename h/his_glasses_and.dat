5|$|Meanwhile, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) teaches Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{about his}} {{favorite}} movie, Die Hard, {{and attempts to}} recite all the dialogue from memory while an impressed Erin checks his accuracy using an online transcript. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), who is still away in the Caribbean after sailing his family's boat, emails Erin and {{says that he is}} going to stay for a few weeks. Hurt, Erin decides to watch Die Hard with Pete rather than just hear him quote it. While watching the movie, Erin begins to cry and Pete tries to comfort her by placing his arm around her. In the meantime, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) tells Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) about the Scranton Strangler case he was on. After boring her for what is implied to be several hours, she hushes him, before gently kissing him. Toby then whips off <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> <b>and</b> kisses her back.|$|E
5|$|Takamatsu is {{an honor}} student who has a polite {{personality}} and wears glasses. He mainly contributes to the SSS through intelligence gathering and other affairs but does not actively fight. Yuri herself says to not be fooled by <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> <b>and</b> that he is actually an idiot. Though appearing to be slender, he works out and is actually well-built muscle-wise. After he first reveals this, he tends to take his shirt off, much to everyone's discomfort. He is absorbed by a shadow and is turned into an NPC. However, having strong enough feelings (according to Yuri), {{he is able to}} regain his senses and manages to disappear like the others. He carries a Desert Eagle as a side-arm, but is also seen using a Sig 552.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{known for}} coming to council {{meetings}} in blue jeans with unkempt hair, Layton worked to change his image {{to run for mayor}} in the 1991 civic election. He also started wearing contact lenses, abandoning <b>his</b> <b>glasses,</b> <b>and</b> traded in his blue jeans for suits. In February 1991, Layton became the first official NDP candidate for the mayoralty, pitting him against centrist incumbent Art Eggleton. In a move that surprised many, Eggleton elected not to run again.|$|E

25|$|Rakes was {{swinging}} {{the flag and}} trying to hit him, not trying to spear him as it appears in the photo, and he narrowly missed. Landsmark was bloodied during the incident. An examination of all the photographs in the roll Forman shot reveals that Rakes missed Landsmark with the flag. Although anti-busing activist Jim Kelly appears to pin Landsmark's arms behind him, he is actually helping Landsmark to his feet. Kelly later positions himself between Landsmark and the other protestors to protect the lawyer. Landsmark had already been knocked to the ground, losing <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> <b>and</b> suffering a broken nose, {{by the time he}} got up the famous picture was taken.|$|E
25|$|New York City Police Commissioner Julius Enderby is {{secretly}} {{a member}} of the Medievalists, a subversive anti-robot group which pines for the 'olden days' where men did not live in the 'caves of steel'. He uses his position to engineer meetings with Spacer Dr. Sarton under the guise of further cooperation, but he actually intends to destroy R. Daneel - who lives with and resembles Dr. Sarton. Enderby orders R. Sammy to bring a blaster through the unmonitored 'open air' (something that no Earthman could countenance), but {{in the heat of the}} moment Enderby drops <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> <b>and</b> fails to distinguish between the human and robot, accidentally shooting the human. Knowing that Baley's wife is also a Medievalist, he assigns Baley to the case, working with R. Daneel who represents the Spacers, and spreads a rumour about humanoid robots amongst the subversives to throw suspicion on Baley when Enderby later destroys R. Sammy with radiation. Furthermore, Daneel rules out Enderby as the murderer as his brain patterns show him incapable of deliberately killing.|$|E
500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov's {{studies and}} his change in {{attitude}} regarding music education brought him the scorn of his fellow nationalists, {{who thought he was}} throwing away his Russian heritage to compose fugues and sonatas. After he strove [...] "to crowd in as much counterpoint as possible" [...] into his Third Symphony, he wrote chamber works adhering strictly to classical models, including a string sextet, a string quartet in F minor and a quintet for flute, clarinet, horn, bassoon and piano. About the quartet and the symphony, Tchaikovsky wrote to his patroness, Nadezhda von Meck, that they [...] "were filled with a host of clever things but... imbued with a dryly pedantic character". Borodin commented that when he heard the symphony, he kept [...] "feeling that this is the work of a German Herr Professor who has put on <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> <b>and</b> is about to write Eine grosse Symphonie in C".|$|E

2500|$|At 2:38 pm EST, while {{filling in}} time with some {{observations}} about the security presence in Dallas, which had been increased due to a disastrous visit by United Nations Ambassador Adlai Stevenson to the city earlier in 1963, Cronkite was handed a new bulletin. After looking it over for a moment, he took off <b>his</b> <b>glasses,</b> <b>and</b> made the official announcement: ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{lecture at}} the Zoological Institute of the University of Zurich also was {{interrupted}} by two groups of protesters. The first group {{was a group of}} disabled people who staged a brief protest {{at the beginning of the}} lecture. They objected to inviting an advocate of euthanasia to speak. At the end of this protest, when Singer tried to address their concerns, a second group of protesters rose and began chanting [...] "Singer raus! Singer raus!" [...] ("Singer out!") When Singer attempted to respond, a protester jumped on stage and grabbed <b>his</b> <b>glasses,</b> <b>and</b> the host ended the lecture. The first group of protesters was distressed by this second, more aggressive group. It had not intended to halt the lecture and even had questions to ask Singer. Singer explains [...] "my views are not threatening to anyone, even minimally" [...] and says that some groups play on the anxieties of those who hear only keywords that are understandably worrying (given the constant fears of ever repeating the Holocaust) if taken with any less than the full context of his belief system.|$|E
2500|$|The RUC at Forkhill {{received}} an emergency call at 3.45 pm reporting {{that there were}} two dead men on the Edenappa Road. Police arrived on the scene at 3.54 pm, where they found Breen lying dead on the roadside; alongside the body was his pen, <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> <b>and</b> the white handkerchief that he had been carrying. His wallet, warrant card and pager were missing. Buchanan's body was behind the wheel of his car, with his seatbelt still fastened. Although the crime scene was cordoned off, the police were unable to remove the bodies or inspect the area due to a sudden snowstorm, therefore the bodies were not taken away until the following morning after they had been checked for booby-trap bombs. When the security forces inspected the scene, they found Kleenex tissue and a Lucozade bottle, but later forensic tests on the items did not find any fingerprints or saliva. Ballistic testing showed that the weapons used in the attack were two [...]223 Armalite rifles, one Ruger Mini-14 and a 7.62 Short rifle. A total of 25 rounds had been fired in the attack, 11 of the bullets had struck the car's front windscreen. One of the Armalites had last been used in a helicopter attack at Silverbridge on 23 June 1988 and the other Armalite had been used in the killing of alleged Garda informer Eamonn Maguire on 1 September 1987 at Cullaville. The other two guns were [...] "clean" [...] weapons.|$|E
