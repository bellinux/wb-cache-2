The Constitution, specifically Articles 10 and 71-74, recognizes the inalienable rights of ecosystems to exist and flourish, gives people the authority to petition on the behalf of ecosystems, and requires the government to remedy violations of these rights.

They urged the Club to support immigration reduction. The Club had previously addressed the issue of [...] "mass immigration," [...] and in 1988, the organization's Population Committee and Conservation Coordinating Committee stated that immigration to the U.S. should be limited, so as to achieve population stabilization.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Ecological crises {{associated}} with <b>the</b> global <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> natural <b>environment</b> call for dialogues and action {{to develop an}} economically and environmentally sustainable world. This paper proposes a new narrative for humanity by connecting ecology with broad ideas about occupation and occupational justice. Method: The authors reflect on literature and action projects on ecology, occupation, and occupational justice. Results: The authors propose that doing ecology is essentially occupational, and necessarily a matter of occupational justice given the strong link between poverty and <b>the</b> <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> natural <b>environment.</b> Conclusion: Eco-social occupational therapy practices are illustrated in poverty reduction projects, funded through university– community partnerships in Spain. The potential to expand eco-social occupational therapy lies in publicly embracing ecological challenges, focusing practices on changing <b>the</b> <b>environment,</b> and attracting partners to find new funding for enabling people everywhere to participate in ecological sustainability through occupation.
