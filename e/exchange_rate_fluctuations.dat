5|$|Following the Smithsonian Agreement, {{member states}} of the European Economic Community adopted a {{narrower}} currency band of 1.125% for exchange rates among their own currencies, creating a smaller scale fixed exchange rate system known as the snake in the tunnel. The snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel EEC countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies. In 1979, the European Monetary System (EMS) phased out the currency snake. The EMS featured two key components: the European Currency Unit (ECU), an artificial weighted average market basket of European Union members' currencies, and the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), a procedure for managing <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>fluctuations</b> in keeping with a calculated parity grid of currencies' par values. The parity grid was derived from parities each participating country established for its currency with all other currencies in the system, denominated in terms of ECUs. The weights within the ECU changed in response to variances in the values of each currency in its basket. Under the ERM, if an exchange rate reached its upper or lower limit (within a 2.25% band), both nations in that currency pair were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign exchange market and buy or sell the under- or overvalued currency as necessary to return the exchange rate to its par value according to the parity matrix. The requirement of cooperative market intervention marked a key difference from the Bretton Woods system. Similarly to Bretton Woods however, EMS members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible for exchange rates approaching their bounds, as identified by a divergence indicator which measured deviations from the ECU's value. The central exchange rates of the parity grid could be adjusted in exceptional circumstances, and were modified every eight months on average during the systems' initial four years of operation. During its twenty-year lifespan, these central rates were adjusted over 50 times.|$|E

This paper extends previous studies on <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>fluctuation</b> for the case of Malaysia by estimating the augmented capital asset pricing model for the price indexes sectors, including financial, plantation, properties, industrial, tin and mining, trade and services, consumer products and construction sector indexes. Moreover, this study also expands the literature by adapting the modelling proposed by Ibrahim (2008) by considering the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility, Asian financial crisis dummy and pegging <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> dummy. Such an analysis significant in part because of the importance of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>fluctuation</b> as drivers of sectoral returns. In general this study successfully documented the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>fluctuation</b> scenario in Malaysia. Overall, the result suggests that the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>fluctuation</b> in Malaysia can be categorized as the long memory in the volatility process.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility on the manufacturing sector of Nigeria. The flow and stock market theories of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> determination was adopted considering macroeconomic determinants such as balance of trade, trade openness, and net international investment. Furthermore, the influence of changes in parallel <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> official <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> and real effective <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> was modeled on the manufacturing sector output. Vector autoregression techniques and vector error correction mechanism were adopted to explore the macroeconomic determinants of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>fluctuation</b> in Nigeria and to examine the influence of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility on the manufacturing sector output in Nigeria. The <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> showed an unstable and volatile movement in Nigeria. Official <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> significantly impacted on the manufacturing sector of Nigeria and shock to previous manufacturing sector output caused 60. 76 % of the fluctuation in the manufacturing sector output in Nigeria. Trade balance, trade openness and net international investments did not significantly determine <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> in Nigeria. However, own shock accounted for about 95 % of the variation of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>fluctuation</b> in the short-run and long-run. Among other macroeconomic variables, net international investment accounted for about 2. 85 % variation of the real effective <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>fluctuation</b> in the short-run and in the long-run. Monetary authorities should maintain stability of the <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> through proper management so as to encourage local production and government should formulate and implement policies that will develop other {{sectors of the economy}} as this will widen the country’s revenue base, reduce our over reliance on oil sector for our foreign exchange earnings and in turn reduce the shocks on our domestic economy...|$|R

Data was collected from the CBN statistical bulletin in Nigeria from 2003 – 2013 and the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model was employed to estimate the model.
