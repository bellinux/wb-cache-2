5|$|The first {{example of}} a dinitrogen complex to be {{discovered}} was 2+ (see figure at right), and soon many other such complexes were discovered. These complexes, in which a nitrogen molecule donates at least one {{lone pair of electrons}} to a central metal cation, <b>illustrate</b> <b>how</b> N2 might bind to the metal(s) in nitrogenase and the catalyst for the Haber process: these processes involving dinitrogen activation are vitally important in biology and in the production of fertilisers.|$|E
5|$|No. 1 Royal Crescent is a {{historic}} house museum, owned and maintained by the Bath Preservation Trust through its membership to <b>illustrate</b> <b>how</b> wealthy owners of the late 18th century might have furnished and occupied such a house. It was purchased in 1967 by Major Bernard Cayzer, {{a member of the}} family that made its fortune through the Clan shipping line. He donated it to the Trust with an amount of money for its restoration and furnishing. The restoration was led by Philip Jebb. The Bath Preservation Trust was working during 2012–13 to re-unite Number One with its original servants' wing at Number 1A Royal Crescent, which has been in use as a separate dwelling for many years. No. 1 serves as the Trust's headquarters. Number 15 and 16 are still used as a hotel.|$|E

25|$|The most {{significant}} climate processes {{since the middle}} to late Pliocene (approximately 3 million years ago) are the glacial and interglacial cycles. The present interglacial period (the Holocene) has lasted about 11,700 years. Shaped by orbital variations, responses such as {{the rise and fall}} of continental ice sheets and significant sea-level changes helped create the climate. Other changes, including Heinrich events, Dansgaard–Oeschger events and the Younger Dryas, however, <b>illustrate</b> <b>how</b> glacial variations may also influence climate without the orbital forcing.|$|E

25|$|A drapeau tricolore with {{vertical}} red, {{white and}} blue stripes {{was approved by the}} Constituent Assembly on 24 October 1790.

The order was reversed to blue-white-red, the current design, by a resolution passed on 15 February 1794. Despite its official status, the tricolore was rarely used during the revolution. Instead, the red flag of the Jacobin Club, symbolizing defiance and national emergency, was flown. The tricolore was restored to prominence under Napoleon.|$|E

25|$|A {{variety of}} {{government}} task forces, expert panels, private institutions, politicians, and journalists have made recommendations {{for reducing the}} deficit and slowing the growth of debt. Several organizations have compared the future impact of these plans on the deficit, debt, and economy. One helpful way of measuring {{the impact of the}} plans is to compare them in terms of revenue and expense as a percentage of GDP over time, in total and by category. This helps <b>illustrate</b> <b>how</b> the different plan authors have prioritized particular elements of the budget.|$|E
25|$|An open (non-locking or {{otherwise}} traction-aided) differential always supplies close to equal torque to each side. To <b>illustrate</b> <b>how</b> this can limit torque {{applied to the}} driving wheels, imagine a simple rear-wheel drive vehicle, with one rear roadwheel on asphalt with good grip, {{and the other on}} a patch of slippery ice. It takes very little torque to spin the side on slippery ice, and because a differential splits torque equally to each side, the torque that is applied to the side that is on asphalt is limited to this amount.|$|E
25|$|Bifurcation {{theory is}} used to <b>illustrate</b> <b>how</b> small changes in {{parameter}} values can give rise to dramatically different long run outcomes, a mathematical fact {{that may be used}} to explain drastic ecological differences that come about in qualitatively very similar systems. Logistic maps are polynomial mappings, and are often cited as providing archetypal examples of how chaotic behaviour can arise from very simple non-linear dynamical equations. The maps were popularized in a seminal 1976 paper by the theoretical ecologist Robert May. The difference equation is intended to capture the two effects of reproduction and starvation.|$|E
