5|$|Unusually low or high sodium {{levels in}} humans are {{recognized}} in medicine as <b>hyponatremia</b> and hypernatremia. These conditions {{may be caused}} by genetic factors, ageing, or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea.|$|E
5|$|The local {{symptoms}} of victims bitten by the many-banded krait are usually neither serious swelling nor pain; the victims merely feel slightly itchy and numb. Systemic symptoms occur, in general, one {{to six hours}} after being bitten by this snake. Symptoms may include bilateral ptosis, diplopia, discomfort in the chest, general ache, weak feeling in limbs, ataxia, glossolysis, loss of voice, dysphagia, tunnel vision, and difficulty breathing. In case of serious bite, suppression of breathing may occur, leading to death. <b>Hyponatremia</b> is also seen, but less commonly.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hyponatremia,</b> {{an unusually}} {{low level of}} sodium in the blood that may cause {{confusion}} and seizures, is found in 40% of cases. This {{may be caused by}} low cortisol levels or by inappropriate release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary. Several other hormonal deficiencies may develop in the subacute phase. 50% have a deficiency in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), leading to undersecretion of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland and characteristic symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. 75% develop a deficiency to gonadotropins (LH and FSH), which control the reproductive hormone glands. This leads to a disrupted menstrual cycle, infertility and decreased libido.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hyponatremia</b> {{occurs in}} about 20% of those {{admitted}} to hospital and 10% of people {{during or after}} an endurance sporting event. Among those in hospital, <b>hyponatremia</b> is {{associated with an increased}} risk of death. The economic costs of <b>hyponatremia</b> are estimated at $2.6 billion in the United States.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the major}} causes of elderly falls is <b>hyponatremia,</b> an {{electrolyte}} disturbance when the level of sodium in a person's serum drops below 135 mEq/L. <b>Hyponatremia</b> {{is the most common}} electrolyte disorder encountered in the elderly patient population. Studies have shown that older patients are more prone to <b>hyponatremia</b> as a result of multiple factors including physiologic changes associated with aging such as decreases in glomerular filtration rate, a tendency for defective sodium conservation, and increased vasopressin activity. Mild <b>hyponatremia</b> ups the risk of fracture in elderly patients because <b>hyponatremia</b> has been shown to cause subtle neurologic impairment that affects gait and attention, similar to that of moderate alcohol intake.|$|E
25|$|The {{causes of}} <b>hyponatremia</b> are {{typically}} classified by a person's body fluid status into low volume, normal volume, or high volume. Low volume <b>hyponatremia</b> can occur from diarrhea, vomiting, diuretics, and sweating. Normal volume <b>hyponatremia</b> {{is divided into}} cases with dilute urine and concentrated urine. Cases in which the urine is dilute include adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, and drinking too much water or too much beer. Cases in which the urine is concentrated include syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). High volume <b>hyponatremia</b> can occur from heart failure, liver failure, and kidney failure. Conditions {{that can lead to}} falsely low sodium measurements include high blood protein levels such as in multiple myeloma, high blood fat levels, and high blood sugar.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{is based}} on the {{underlying}} cause. Correcting <b>hyponatremia</b> too quickly can lead to complications. Rapid partial correction with 3% normal saline is only recommended in those with significant symptoms and occasionally those in whom the condition was of rapid onset. Low volume <b>hyponatremia</b> is typically treated with intravenous normal saline. SIADH is typically treated with fluid restriction while high volume <b>hyponatremia</b> is typically treated with both fluid restriction and a diet low in salt. Correction should generally be gradual in those in whom the low levels have been present for more than two days.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hyponatremia</b> is {{the most}} {{commonly}} seen water–electrolyte imbalance. The disorder is more frequent in females, the elderly, and in people who are hospitalized. The incidence of <b>hyponatremia</b> depends largely on the patient population. A hospital incidence of 15–20% is common, while only 3–5% {{of people who are}} hospitalized have a serum sodium level (salt blood level) of less than 130mmol/L. <b>Hyponatremia</b> has been reported in up to 30% of elderly patients in nursing homes and is also present in approximately 30% of depressed patients on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hyponatremia</b> {{is a low}} sodium {{level in}} the blood. It is {{generally}} defined as a sodium concentration of less than 135 mmol/L (135 mEq/L), with severe <b>hyponatremia</b> being below 120 mEql/L. Symptoms can be absent, mild or severe. Mild symptoms include a decreased ability to think, headaches, nausea, and poor balance. Severe symptoms include confusion, seizures, and coma.|$|E
25|$|High volume <b>hyponatremia,</b> wherein {{there is}} {{decreased}} effective circulating volume (less blood flowing in the body) even though total body volume is increased (by {{the presence of}} edema or swelling, especially in the ankles). The decreased effective circulating volume stimulates the release of anti-diuretic hormone(ADH), which in turn leads to water retention. Hypervolemic <b>hyponatremia</b> is most commonly the result of congestive heart failure, liver failure, or kidney disease.|$|E
25|$|Serum sodium – <b>hyponatremia</b> due to {{inability}} to excrete free water resulting from {{high levels of}} ADH and aldosterone.|$|E
25|$|Low volume <b>hyponatremia,</b> wherein ADH {{secretion}} is {{stimulated by}} or associated with volume depletion (not enough {{water in the}} body).|$|E
25|$|Acute <b>hyponatremia</b> is when sodium levels drop rapidly, {{resulting}} in potentially dangerous effects, such as rapid brain swelling, which {{can result in}} coma and death.|$|E
25|$|Generally {{water intake}} {{should be limited}} to 1.5 L daily or less in {{patients}} with <b>hyponatremia,</b> though fluid restriction may be beneficial regardless in symptomatic reduction.|$|E
25|$|Large {{amounts of}} ANP {{secretion}} {{has been noted}} to cause electrolyte disturbances (<b>hyponatremia)</b> and polyuria. These indications can be a marker of a large atrial myxoma.|$|E
25|$|Urea and {{electrolytes}} {{are usually}} normal, although hypocalcemia and <b>hyponatremia</b> are possible in tuberculous meningoencephalitis due to SIADH. In advanced disease, hypoalbuminemia, hyperproteinemia, and hyperglobulinemia may be present.|$|E
25|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of <b>hyponatremia</b> include nausea and vomiting, headache, short-term memory loss, confusion, lethargy, fatigue, loss of appetite, irritability, muscle weakness, spasms or cramps, seizures, and decreased consciousness or coma.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{personnel}} aim {{to determine}} whether a seizure is caused by a change in the patient's biochemistry, such as <b>hyponatremia.</b> Neurological examinations and tests to measure levels of serum electrolytes are performed.|$|E
25|$|Fluid {{balance is}} key. Profuse {{sweating}} {{can increase the}} need for electrolyte (salt) replacement. Water intoxication (which results in <b>hyponatremia),</b> the process of consuming too much water too quickly, can be fatal.|$|E
25|$|The {{heart rate}} can be slowed by altered sodium and {{potassium}} levels, hypoxia, acidosis, alkalosis, and hypothermia. The relationship between electrolytes and HR is complex, but maintaining electrolyte balance {{is critical to}} the normal wave of depolarization. Of the two ions, potassium has the greater clinical significance. Initially, both <b>hyponatremia</b> (low sodium levels) and hypernatremia (high sodium levels) may lead to tachycardia. Severely high hypernatremia may lead to fibrillation, which may cause CO to cease. Severe <b>hyponatremia</b> leads to both bradycardia and other arrhythmias. Hypokalemia (low potassium levels) also leads to arrhythmias, whereas hyperkalemia (high potassium levels) causes the heart to become weak and flaccid, and ultimately to fail.|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{similarity}} to vasopressin, it {{can reduce the}} excretion of urine slightly. In several species, oxytocin can stimulate sodium excretion from the kidneys (natriuresis), and, in humans, high doses can result in low sodium levels (<b>hyponatremia).</b>|$|E
25|$|Increased {{water intake}} {{may also help}} in {{acclimatization}} to replace the fluids lost through heavier breathing in the thin, dry air found at altitude, although consuming excessive quantities ("over-hydration") has no benefits and may cause dangerous <b>hyponatremia.</b>|$|E
25|$|People {{who have}} <b>hyponatremia</b> who require {{hospitalisation}} {{have a longer}} length of stay (with associated increased costs) and also have a higher likelihood of requiring readmission. This is particularly the case in men and in the elderly.|$|E
25|$|Urea {{has also}} been studied as a diuretic. It was first used Dr. W. Friedrich in 1892. In a 2010 study of ICU patients, urea was used to treat euvolemic <b>hyponatremia</b> and was found a safe, inexpensive, and simple.|$|E
25|$|Vasopressin receptors {{activated}} by vasopressin are {{found on the}} basolateral membrane of the cells lining the collecting ducts of the kidneys. Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage(aSAH) results in <b>hyponatremia</b> which leads to water retention and antidiuretic hormone release causing increase in intracranial pressure and formation of cerebral edema. This can be prevented by administration of conivaptan, a safe FDA approved drug that treats euvolemic <b>hyponatremia.</b> Through the process of aquaresis, conivapten which is a vasopressin receptor antagonist improves serum sodium concentration while eliminating free water without having any negative effect on systolic blood pressure and pulse rate. Since it can decrease cerebral volume and ICP, it has a potential to treat many forms of cerebral edema.|$|E
25|$|In 1905, James Edward Brooks of North Adams, Massachusetts died of {{pneumonia}} shortly after running the marathon. In 1996, a 61-year-old Swedish man, Humphrey Siesage, {{died of a}} heart attack during the 100th running. In 2002, Cynthia Lucero, 28, died of <b>hyponatremia.</b>|$|E
25|$|There is {{tentative}} {{evidence that}} vasopressin receptor antagonists (vaptans), such as conivaptan, may be slightly {{more effective than}} fluid restriction in those with high volume or normal volume <b>hyponatremia.</b> They {{should not be used}} in people with low volume. Their use in SIADH is unclear.|$|E
25|$|Moderate and/or {{symptomatic}} <b>hyponatremia</b> {{is treated}} {{by raising the}} serum sodium level by 0.5 to 1mmol per liter per hour {{for a total of}} 8mmol per liter during the first day with the use of furosemide and replacing sodium and potassium losses with 0.9% saline.|$|E
25|$|Common {{adverse effects}} of {{acetazolamide}} include the following: paraesthesia, fatigue, drowsiness, depression, decreased libido, bitter or metallic taste, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, black feces, polyuria, kidney stones, metabolic acidosis and electrolyte changes (hypokalemia, <b>hyponatremia).</b> Whereas less common adverse effects include Stevens–Johnson syndrome, anaphylaxis and blood dyscrasias.|$|E
25|$|Mild and {{asymptomatic}} <b>hyponatremia</b> {{is treated}} with adequate solute intake (including salt and protein) and fluid restriction starting at 500 ml per day {{of water with}} adjustments based on serum sodium levels. Long-term fluid restriction of 1,200–1,800 mL/day may maintain the person in a symptom free state.|$|E
25|$|Stimulation of the {{posterior}} pituitary to release vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone, ADH) also acts on the kidneys to increase water retention. If ADH production is excessive in heart failure, Na+ {{level in the}} plasma may fall (<b>hyponatremia),</b> {{and this is a}} sign of increased risk of death in heart failure patients.|$|E
25|$|Any sign of low blood sodium (<b>hyponatremia)</b> or {{weakness}} {{should be}} treated {{with the addition of}} hematin, heme arginate, or even tin mesoporphyrin, as these are signs of impending syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) or peripheral nervous system involvement that may be localized or severe, progressing to bulbar paresis and respiratory paralysis.|$|E
25|$|Reported {{adverse events}} which were {{temporally}} correlated to duloxetine therapy include rash, reported rarely, {{and the following}} adverse events, reported very rarely: alanine aminotransferase increased, alkaline phosphatase increased, anaphylactic reaction, angioneurotic edema, aspartate aminotransferase increased, bilirubin increased, glaucoma, hepatotoxicity, <b>hyponatremia,</b> jaundice, orthostatic hypotension (especially at the initiation of treatment), Stevens–Johnson syndrome, syncope (especially at initiation of treatment), and urticaria.|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{absorption}} {{is affected}} by the release of interleukin-6 as this can cause the secretion of arginine vasopressin which, in turn, can lead to exercise-associated dangerously low sodium levels (<b>hyponatremia).</b> This loss of sodium in blood plasma can result in swelling of the brain. This can be prevented by awareness of the risk of drinking excessive amounts of fluids during prolonged exercise.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{adverse effects}} {{are usually the}} result of high or {{multiple}} doses, although single dose toxicity can occur in susceptible individuals. The most serious short-term physical health risks of MDMA are hyperthermia and dehydration. Cases of life-threatening or fatal <b>hyponatremia</b> (excessively low sodium concentration in the blood) have developed in MDMA users attempting to prevent dehydration by consuming excessive amounts of water without replenishing electrolytes.|$|E
25|$|Salt-wasting {{in early}} infancy {{does not occur}} in most cases of 11β-OH CAH but can occur because of {{impaired}} production of aldosterone aggravated by inefficiency of salt conservation in early infancy. When it occurs it resembles the salt-wasting of severe 21-hydroxylase deficient CAH: poor weight gain and vomiting in the first weeks of life progress and culminate in life-threatening dehydration, <b>hyponatremia,</b> hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis in the first month.|$|E
