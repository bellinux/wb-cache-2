40|$|Cover {{temperature}} variations {{were determined}} at four {{municipal solid waste}} landfills located in different climatic regions in North America: Michigan, New Mexico, Alaska, and British Columbia. Cover temperatures varied seasonally similarly to air temperatures and demonstrated amplitude decrement and phase lag with depth. Elevated temperatures in the underlying wastes resulted in warmer temperatures and low frost penetration in the covers compared to surrounding subgrade soils. The ranges of measured temperatures decreased and average temperatures generally increased (approximately 2 °C/m) with depth. The ranges of measured temperatures (Tmax−Tmin) were 18 – 30 °C and 13 – 21 °C and the average temperatures were 13 – 18 °C and 14 – 23 °C at 1 and 2 m depths, respectively. For soil and <b>geosynthetic</b> <b>barrier</b> materials around 1 m depth, the maximum and minimum temperatures were 22 – 25 °C and 3 – 4 °C, respectively. Frost depths were determined to be approximately 50 % of those for soils at ambient conditions. The main direction of heat flow in the covers was upward (negative gradients). The cover gradients varied between − 18 and 14 °C/m, with averages of − 7 to 1 °C/m. The gradients for soil and <b>geosynthetic</b> <b>barrier</b> materials around 1 m depth varied between − 11 and 9 °C/m {{with an average of}} − 2 °C/m. Cover thawing n-factors ranged between 1. 0 and 1. 4 and the cover freezing n-factor was 0. 6. Design charts and guidelines are provided for cover thermal analyses for variable climatic conditions...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper {{describes}} {{the background and}} remediation steps that were taken to contain migration of a subsurface hydrocarbon contaminant plume at a site in the Canadian Arctic. A composite liner consisting of a novel fluorine surface-treated high-density polyethylene geomembrane and a geosynthetic clay liner {{was selected as the}} short-term (several years) barrier solution. The paper {{describes the}} design details, the selection criteria, and the challenges that were overcome to install the barrier system. A complimentary program of site monitoring is underway together with a parallel program of laboratory testing investigating the long-term effects of freeze-thaw, low temperatures, and contact with jet fuel on specimens of the barrier components. Results from site monitoring show that the barrier system is performing as planned three years after installation. Laboratory tests completed to date show that the <b>geosynthetic</b> <b>barrier</b> materials can be expected to maintain acceptably low rates of hydrocarbon diffusion and advection well beyond the original 3 -year design life of the barrier system...|$|E
40|$|Bituminous geomembranes, {{one type}} of geosynthetics, include a hot {{bituminous}} mixture with mineral filler and reinforcement. In this study, boron production waste clay (CW) was used as filler to produce a <b>geosynthetic</b> <b>barrier</b> with bentonite, waste tire, and bitumen. Bentonite and waste tires were used as auxiliary fillers and bitumen as the binder. CW/bitumen, CW/bentonite/bitumen, and CW/waste tire/bitumen mixtures were prepared by using a laboratory mixer at 100 °C. Hot mixtures were extruded into strips by using a lab-scale corotating twin screw extruder (L/D: 40) followed by die casting (2 [*]mm × 100 [*]mm). Glass fleece or nonwoven polyester was used as reinforcement material and while die casting, {{both sides of the}} reinforcement materials were covered with bituminous mixture. Thickness, mass per unit area, tensile strength, elongation at yield, and hydraulic conductivity were used to characterize the geomembranes. Among all geomembranes, nonwoven polyester covered with 30 % bitumen- 70 % boron waste clay mixture (PK-BTM 30 CW 70) was found to be the most promising in terms of structure and mechanical behaviour. After that, consequences of its exposure to distilled water (DW), municipal solid waste landfill leachate (L-MSW), and hazardous waste landfill leachate (L-HW) were examined to use for an innovative impermeable liner on solid waste landfills...|$|E
40|$|Capping {{systems with}} mineral liners- {{compacted}} clay liners CCL {{as well as}} clay <b>geosynthetic</b> <b>barriers</b> GBR-C- are often applied as a standard cover for landfills with small or medium hazardous waste. During dry periods, the clay liners can show a suction-induced dewatering due to seasonal fluctuation of the restoration layer’s soil moisture. In addition, {{the roots of the}} vegetation can deepen and pene-trate into the mineral liner. If an ultimate suction is exceeded in the clay liner, irreversible cracks will occur and will reduce the sealing effect dramatically. The stress and deformation under which tensile cracks initially occur are imposed by the moister change of the adjacent layers and on the allowable suction of the mineral material related on its soil-physical properties and the stress conditions. Know-ing this limits of effect and resistance a mineral layer can be designed with an engineering approach. The paper briefly shows the different impacts and some design principles to reduce the probability of desiccation cracks in cover systems with mineral liners...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{provides}} theoretical background, laboratory {{data and}} full-scale measurements useful {{in understanding the}} interaction between soils and geosynthetics under unsaturated conditions. It also includes {{an evaluation of the}} current state of knowledge regarding the hydraulic properties of porous geosynthetics under unsaturated conditions relevant for <b>geosynthetic</b> capillary <b>barrier</b> design. These properties include the water retention curve and the hydraulic conductivity function. In addition, the mechanisms involved in the development of capillary barriers are evaluated to explain the storage of water at the interface between materials with contrasting hydraulic conductivity (e. g. a fine-grained soil and a nonwoven geotextile). Finally, specific applications are presented to illustrate new opportunities and applications that may result from {{a better understanding of the}} unsaturated hydraulic properties of geosynthetics. Experimental data are provided illustrating that <b>geosynthetic</b> capillary <b>barriers</b> are superior to soil-only capillary barriers. Based on this observation, it is emphasized that no capillary barrier should be designed without consideration of the enhanced performance offered by the inclusion of nonwoven geotextiles under the fine-grained soil component of the cover...|$|R
40|$|The Bentonite Mat Demonstration was {{developed}} to provide the Environmental Restoration Department with field performance characteristics and engineering data for an alternative closure cover system configuration. The demonstration was initiated in response to regulatory concerns {{regarding the use of}} an alternative cover system for future design configurations. These design considerations are in lieu of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Recommended Design for Closure Cover Systems and specifically a single compacted kaolin clay layer with a hydraulic conductivity of 1 {times} 10 {sup {minus} 7 } cm/sec. This alternative configuration is a composite <b>geosynthetic</b> material hydraulic <b>barrier</b> consisting from bottom to top: 2 ft compacted sandy clay layer (typical local Savannah River Site soil type) that is covered by a bentonite mat [...] geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) and is overlaid by a 40 mil High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) geomembrane [...] flexible membrane liner. This effort was undertaken to obtain and document the necessary field performance/engineering data for future designs and meet regulatory technical requirements for an alternative cover system configuration. The composite <b>geosynthetic</b> materials hydraulic <b>barrier</b> is the recommended alternative cover system configuration for containment of hazardous and low level radiological waste layers that have a high potential of subsidence to be used at the Savannah River Site (SRS). This alternative configuration mitigates subsidence effects in providing a flexible, lightweight cover system to maintain the integrity of the closure. The composite <b>geosynthetic</b> materials hydraulic <b>barrier</b> is recommended for the Sanitary Landfill and Low Level Radiological Waste Disposal Facility (LLRWDF) Closures...|$|R
