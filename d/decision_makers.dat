5|$|There {{have been}} critiques {{of the theory}} from several perspectives. Arguments include that it {{emphasizes}} justice {{to the exclusion of}} other moral values, such as caring; that there is such an overlap between stages that they should more properly be regarded as separate domains; or that evaluations of the reasons for moral choices are mostly post hoc rationalizations (by both <b>decision</b> <b>makers</b> and psychologists studying them) of essentially intuitive decisions.|$|E

The rules were constantly altered and elaborated upon by the political <b>decision</b> <b>makers</b> in Washington and Vientiane and bore little relation to the reality on the ground.

30|$|The {{concept of}} {{rationality}} {{to be used}} here is that of Savage (1954). That means that each <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> satisfies the Savage axioms of rational behavior. Then, the <b>decision</b> <b>maker’s</b> preferences can be represented via a utility function such that the <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> is maximizing his utility. Furthermore, the Savage axioms conceptualize the uncertainty the <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> is facing such {{that it is the}} personal beliefs that are taken into account when decisions are made. Given the independence axioms the <b>decision</b> <b>maker’s</b> preferences can be represented as an expected utility. To keep the analysis simple, it is always assumed that the <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> has utility for the payment he gets from working for the firm and the effort variable describes the discrepancy of the utility of the <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> compared to the firm. The simple interpretation of the effort variable is a personal cost that the <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> incurs to implement the chosen decision. More fundamentally it catches the fundamental difference in goals of the <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> compared to the goals of the firm.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Multiobjective {{evolutionary}} {{method is}} a way to overcome the limitation of the classical methods, by finding multiple solutions within a single run of the solution procedure. The aim of having a solution method for multiobjective optimization problem is to help the <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> in getting the best solution. Usually the <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> is not interested in a diverse set of Pareto optimal points. So, it is necessary to incorporate the <b>decision</b> <b>maker’s</b> preference so that the algorithm gives out alternative solutions around the <b>decision</b> <b>maker’s</b> preference. The problem in incorporating the <b>decision</b> <b>maker’s</b> preference is that the <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> may not have a solid guide line in comparing tradeoffs of objectives. However, it is easy for the <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> to compare in a fuzzy way. This paper discusses on incorporating a fuzzy tradeoffs in the evolutionary algorithm to zoom out the region where the <b>decision</b> <b>maker’s</b> preference lies. By using test functions it has shown {{that it is possible to}} give points in the region on the Pareto front where the <b>decision</b> <b>maker’s</b> interest lies...|$|R

We derive conditions under which the <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> prefers a sequential launch to a simultaneous launch. The conditions depend on the cost of adoption and the initial assessment of the product. We derive the optimal launch sequence.

40|$|When {{making a}} <b>decision,</b> a <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> selects {{one of several}} {{possible}} actions and hopes to achieve a desirable outcome. To make a better <b>decision,</b> the <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> often asks experts for advice. In this article, we consider two methods of acquiring advice for decision making. We begin with a method where one or more experts predict the effect of each action and the <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> then selects an action based on the predictions. We characterize strictly proper decision making, where experts {{have an incentive to}} accurately reveal their beliefs about the outcome of each action. However, strictly proper decision making requires the <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> use a completely mixed strategy to choose an action. To address this limitation, we consider a second method where the <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> asks a single expert to recommend an action. We show {{that it is possible to}} elicit the <b>decision</b> <b>maker’s</b> most preferred action for a broad class of preferences of the <b>decision</b> <b>maker,</b> including when the <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> is an expected value maximizer...|$|R
40|$|A <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> is {{interested}} in appointing one individual {{from a group of}} candidates to a public position with an exogenous wage. He must decide in what order to approach them. Candidates who are more valuable to the <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> {{are less likely to be}} available. The candidates' preferences have a social component: each candidate finds the position more attractive if he is highly ranked by the <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> (relative to the other candidates). However, the <b>decision</b> <b>maker's</b> preferences are his private information. As a result, candidates infer the <b>decision</b> <b>maker's</b> evaluation of them based on the number of candidates who have previously turned him down. The main result is that when the number of candidates is suficiently large, all of the candidates reject the <b>decision</b> <b>maker's</b> offers, including those whom he most values. Moreover, the <b>decision</b> <b>maker's</b> payoff is not monotonic in the number of candidates...|$|R
40|$|A biased, {{perfectly}} informed expert advises {{a partially}} and privately informed <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> using cheap-talk message.

The <b>decision</b> <b>maker’s</b> response to the expert’s advice becomes less sensitive under the former’s own information. In response, the expert provides advice that is con-sidered more biased, relative to the case when <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> is uninformed. For some types of <b>decision</b> <b>maker,</b> this negative, strategic effect of their own information outweighs its direct, positive effect—being informed makes them worse off.

25|$|Game theorists use the Nash {{equilibrium}} {{concept to}} analyze {{the outcome of the}} strategic interaction of several <b>decision</b> <b>makers.</b> In other words, it provides a way of predicting what will happen if several people or several institutions are making decisions at the same time, and if the outcome depends on the decisions of the others. The simple insight underlying John Nash's idea is that one cannot predict the result of the choices of multiple <b>decision</b> <b>makers</b> if one analyzes those decisions in isolation. Instead, one must ask what each player would do, taking into account the decision-making of the others.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> who can select {{one of a}} finite set of possible actions, each of which will result in one of a finite set of possible outcomes. If the <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> has preferences over these outcomes, it will naturally prefer taking some actions to others, but may be uncertain of the result of each action. In this paper we describe how a <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> can elicit expert predictions about the outcome of each action, allowing the <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> to make an informed decision. We show that strictly proper decision making, where experts {{have an incentive to}} accurately reveal their beliefs about the outcome of each action, allows the <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> to take a preferred action with probability arbitrarily close—but not equal—to one; with positive probability, the <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> must take an action at random.
