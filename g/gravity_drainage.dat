25|$|Belt press filters have 4 main zones: {{preconditioning}} zone, <b>gravity</b> <b>drainage</b> zone, linear compression (low-pressure) {{zone and}} roller compression (high-pressure) zone. Preconditioned slurry, which is flocculated and/or coagulated {{depending on the}} feed and process, is thickened in the <b>gravity</b> <b>drainage</b> zone. The <b>gravity</b> <b>drainage</b> zone is a flat or inclined belt where <b>gravity</b> <b>drainage</b> of free water occurs The <b>gravity</b> <b>drainage</b> area is sized according to feed solid concentrations. The standard size {{can be used for}} solids concentrations of 1.5 percent or greater, but a setup with a longer drainage area or extended size should be used for 1.5 to 2.5 percent feed solids for more free water drainage before compression. For dilute sludge with feed solids of less than 1.5 percent, an independent <b>gravity</b> <b>drainage</b> belt can be used. This belt is used only in the <b>gravity</b> <b>drainage</b> area, not in the pressure zones. The pressure or wedge zones use two belts, upper and lower, to sandwich the feed together, but an independent gravity zone has its own separate belt, making the belt filter a three-belt system. Depending on the required conditions of the cake, belt filters can have added washing stages and, infrared, hot gas or even microwave drying stages.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{objective}} of a belt press filter is to dewater process sludge {{and much of}} this dewatering occurs in the <b>gravity</b> <b>drainage</b> zone. The <b>gravity</b> <b>drainage</b> zone can achieve a 5 to 10 percent increase in solids concentration. The degree of dewatering in the <b>gravity</b> <b>drainage</b> zone is greatly dependent {{on the type of}} solids, the filter media and the sludge conditioning. The dewatering achieved in the <b>gravity</b> <b>drainage</b> zone is adversely affected if the sludge is poorly spread across the belt or the residence time is insufficient. Sludge conditioning is the addition of chemicals to promote flocculation of particles to form a thickened sludge and to promote dewatering. Dewatering can be promoted by the addition of surfactant and flocculation is achieved via the addition of high molecular weight polymer. Flocculation is improved with optimum polymer dosage, polymer dilution and mixing. The pH of the feed slurry must also be monitored and controlled as low pH decreases flocculation. It is important to find the optimum value for each conditioning parameter as too much polymer or mixing can {{have a negative impact on}} flocculation and greatly increase operating expenses. The effects of sludge conditioning are most apparent in the <b>gravity</b> <b>drainage</b> zone which can be easily replicated on a laboratory scale where the optimum conditioning strategy can be determined. For a belt press filter to be industrially viable it must be economically efficient and thus maximum throughput is desired. Without sufficient conditioning, the <b>gravity</b> <b>drainage</b> is generally the limiting process step, but with optimum dilution the limiting process step can be shifted to the compression zone.|$|E

5000|$|In the SAGD process, two {{parallel}} horizontal oil wells are drilled in the formation, one about 4 to 6 metres above the other.

The heat from the steam reduces the viscosity of the heavy crude oil or bitumen which allows it to flow down into the lower wellbore. The steam and associated gas rise because of their low density compared to the heavy crude oil below, ensuring that steam is not produced at the lower production well, tend to rise in the steam chamber, filling the void space left by the oil.

These studies, which started in some sample areas since long ago, were further deepened and extended to a wider number of drainage basins, representative of a variety of morphostructural conditions. The complex cause/effect relationships among factors influencing both the morphogenesis and the plano-altimetric configurations of drainage basins resulted in a large variability in the values of the denudation index (Tu), which ranged from 200 to 2500 Â t/km 2 /year. Very high values (Tu > 10, 000 Â t/km 2 /year) were obtained for small catchments belonging to the wider basins of Ombrone River and Tevere River, where fast morphological modifications occur due to the action of surface running waters and <b>gravity.</b> In the <b>drainage</b> basins affected by the most powerful denudation processes direct measurements of denudation were performed: several monitoring stations were equipped with iron stakes and disks to record the local modifications of the topographic surface with time. Whereas some of these stations have been working continuously since 1993, some others have been running only periodically. Direct measurements pertinent to periods longer than a decade indicated that mean annual values of denudation range between 1 and 2. 5 Â cm/year for slopes affected by sharp-edged and/or rounded edged badlands. Higher denudation rates (3 - 4 Â cm/year) were obtained for shorter observation periods; still higher rates were recorded for short periods at the gully bottom or in coincidence with mass movements before bench marks were turned up or damaged. Denudation processes are likely to occur discontinuously. They show a step-like trend with time and are triggered by rainfall events distributed over a number of consecutive days, though not greatly intense. Particularly, their amount should overcome the threshold of 60 Â mm per 5 consecutive days. Below this threshold the surface runoff does not seem to reach the power necessary to induce significant modifications of the topographic surface in the study area. Â© 2006 Elsevier B. V.

The {{aim of this study}} is to examine the use of inferior meatus maxillary antrostomy (IMMA) in combination with traditional maxillary antrostomy, in this challenging patient population. Methods: We performed a retrospective study from February, 2008 until April, 2014 with a 118 patients undergoing a total of 128 IMMA procedures. Data was gathered regarding patient demographic, prior therapy, post-operative medical therapy, IMMA patency, SNOT- 22 scores, Lund Mackay score, and the presence of disease recurrence. Results: 118 patients (mean age 53) underwent 128 IMMA procedures. The mean length of follow-up was 1. 6 years, and 66 % of patients had previous sinus surgery. 62 operations were for recalcitrant maxillary sinus disease, 36 for recalcitrant polyp disease, 6 for maxillary fungal disease, 4 for mucosal disease and 20 for odontogenic infections. 49 patients completed both pre and post-operative SNOT- 22 scores, and the mean scores were 39 and 21, respectively. At 3 months post-operatively, we found that patients undergoing revision surgery and patients with nasal polyposis had the greatest SNOT- 22 improvement. Males had 64 % less SNOT- 22 improvement compared to women at 3 months post operatively. In addition, 18 % of patients did not experience any symptomatic improvement at 3 months post-operatively. With regards to post-operative medical therapy, men were more likely to have been prescribed steroid irrigations and antibiotics. Patients with fungal sinusitis had the greatest need for post-operative steroids. In addition, increased age correlated to fewer post-operative steroid courses. Out of 202 total inferior windows, 197 were patent post-operatively. There were 9 patients requiring revision surgery for maxillary sinus disease following IMMA, and patients requiring revision had the poorest outcomes. Conclusion: Inferior meatal windows prove to be efficacious in patients with mucocillaray dysfunction without disrupting the normal mucociliary flow pattern. The inferior turbinate is also preserved, which may be a less destructive alternative to a mega antrostomies.

40|$|Thesis entitled: Modelling Stable Atmospheric Boundary Layers over Snow H. A. M. Sterk Wageningen, 29 th of April, 2015 Summary The {{emphasis}} of this thesis {{is on the}} understanding and forecasting of the Stable Boundary Layer (SBL) over snow-covered surfaces. SBLs typically form at night and in polar regions (especially in winter), when radiative cooling at the surface causes a cooler surface than the overlying atmosphere and a stable stratification develops. This means that potential temperature increases with height and buoyancy effects suppress turbulence. Turbulence is then dominated by mechanical origin. If sufficient wind shear can be maintained, turbulence remains active, otherwise it will cease. A proper representation of SBLs in numerical weather prediction models is critical, since many parties rely on these forecasts. For example, weather prediction is needed for wind energy resources, agricultural purposes, air-quality studies, and aviation and road traffic. Knowledge on SBLs is also essential for climate modelling. In the Arctic regions, climate change is most pronounced due to stronger changes in near-surface temperature compared to other latitudes. Though this `Arctic amplification&# 39; is not yet fully understood, possible responsible processes are the ice-albedo feedback, alterations in cloud cover and water vapour, different atmospheric and oceanic circulations, and the weak vertical mixing in the lower atmosphere. However, many interactions exist between these processes. With positive feedbacks, changes are even further enhanced. This could have worldwide consequences, i. e. due to affected atmospheric circulations and sea level rise with Greenland&# 39;s melting ice-sheets. Scientists try to explain the observed climate changes, {{as well as provide}} outlooks for future changes in climate and weather. However, the understanding is hampered by the fact that many model output variables (e. g. regarding the 2 m temperature) vary substantially between models on the one hand, and from observations on the other hand. Modelling the SBL remains difficult, because the physical processes at hand are represented in a simplified way, and the understanding of the processes may be incomplete. Furthermore, since processes can play a role at a very small scale, the resolutions in models may be too poor to represent the SBL correctly. Additionally, there are many different archetypes of the SBL. Turbulence can be continuous, practically absent, or intermittent, and vary in strength which affects the efficiency of the exchange of quantities horizontally and vertically. Processes that are considered critical for the SBL evolution are e. g. turbulent mixing, radiative effects, the coupling between the atmosphere and the underlying surface, the presence of clouds or fog, subsidence, advection, <b>gravity</b> waves, and <b>drainage</b> and katabatic flows. In this thesis, {{the focus is on the}} first three processes, as these are most dominant for the evolution of the SBL (e. g. BosveldÂ  et al., 2014 b). In Chapter 3 an idealized clear-sky case over sea-ice was studied based on the GABLS 1 benchmark study (e. g. Cuxart et al., 2006), but extended by including radiative effects and thermal coupling with the surface. Hence the following research questions were posed: Â  Question 1 : What is the variety in model outcome regarding potential temperature and wind speed profiles that can be simulated with one model by using different parametrization schemes? Question 2 : Which of the three governing processes is most critical in determining the SBL state in various wind regimes? Question 3 : Can we identify compensation mechanisms between schemes, and thus identify where possible compensating model errors may be concealed? Â  From the analysis with different parametrization schemes performed with the WRF single-column model (SCM, Question 1), it followed that quite different types of SBLs were found. Some schemes forecasted a somewhat better mixed potential temperature profile where stratification increased with height, while another scheme produced profiles with the strongest stratification close to the surface and stratification decreased with height. After only 9 h of simulation time, a difference in temperature of almost 2 K was found near the surface. Regarding the wind speed profile, some variation was found in the simulated low-level jet speed and height. Mainly the difference in atmospheric boundary-layer (BL) schemes which parametrize the turbulent mixing are responsible for these model output variations. A variation in long wave parametrization schemes hardly affected the model results. Question 2 addresses the problem whether other processes than turbulent mixing may be responsible for a similar spread in model results. A sensitivity analysis was performed where for one set of reference parametrization schemes the intensity of the processes was adjusted. The relative sensitivity of the three processes for different wind regimes was analysed using `process diagrams&# 39;. In a process diagram, two physically related variables are plotted against each other, which in this case represent either a time average or a difference over time of the variable. A line connects the reference state with the state for which the process intensity is modified. By comparing the length and orientation of the lines, the relative significance of the individual processes for the different wind speeds can be studied. Overlapping line directions identify possible compensating errors. Geostrophic wind speeds of 3, 8 and 20 m s- 1 were selected representing low, medium and high wind speeds, capturing the range of wind speeds frequently occurring in the Arctic north of 75 oN according to the ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset. Overall, a shift in relative importance was detected for the various wind regimes. With high geostrophic wind speeds, the model output is most sensitive to turbulent mixing. On the contrary, with low geostrophic wind speeds the model is most sensitive to the radiation and especially the snow-surface coupling. The impact of turbulent mixing is then minor, unless when mixing in both boundary layer and surface layer is adjusted. This stresses that proper linking between these two layers is essential. Also with one set of parametrization schemes different SBL types were simulated. Potential temperature profiles were better mixed (increasing stratification with height) for high geostrophic wind speeds, and this tended to develop to profiles with the strongest stratification near the surface (decreasing stratification with height) for low geostrophic wind speeds. However, a variety in types was also found when keeping the same wind regime, but by varying the mixing strength. With enhanced mixing, the profile became better mixed, also when the reference profile showed the strongest stratification near the surface. With decreased mixing, profiles with a stronger stratification were found, again shaped with the strongest stratification near the surface. Thus a different mixing formulation has a strong impact on the vertical profiles, even when it may not necessarily strongly affect the surface variables. Therefore, it is recommended that when a model is evaluated and optimized, the vertical structure is also regarded in this process, since near-surface variables may be well represented, strong deviations aloft are still possible. Furthermore, the process diagrams showed overlap in sensitivity to some processes. Therefore errors within the parametrizations of these processes could compensate each other and thus remain hidden (Question 3), making the model formulation possibly physically less realistic. This study did not reveal an unambiguous indication for the compensating processes regarding the various sets of variables, though overlap for single variables is seen. This study also revealed a non-linear behaviour regarding the 2 m temperature, which is also found in observations (e. g. LÃ¼pkes et al., 2008) and in a model study by McNider et al. (2012). Here the 2 m temperature decreased with enhanced mixing strength and increased with a lower mixing intensity. This counter-intuitive behaviour is explained by that mixing only occurs in a shallow layer close to the surface. Cold air that is mixed up by the enhanced mixing, is insufficiently compensated by the downward mixed relatively warm air. This behaviour was found mostly for low wind speeds or with decreased mixing at the medium wind regime, when the potential temperature profile showed the strongest stratification near the surface. The study proceeds with a model evaluation against observations in low wind speed regimes. Three stably stratified cloud-free study cases with near-surface wind speeds below 5 m s- 1 were selected with each a different surface: Cabauw in the Netherlands with snow over grass, SodankylÃ¤ in northern Finland with snow in a needle-leaf forest, and Halley in Antarctica with snow on an ice shelf. Chapter 4 presents the evaluation of the WRF- 3 D and SCM for these cases. In this study, the WRF- 3 D model was used to determine the forcings, as often not all the required observations at high resolution in time and space are available. Hence the following questions were formulated: Â  Question 4 : What is the performance of WRF in stable conditions with low wind speeds for three contrasting snow-covered sites? Question 5 : How should we prescribe the single-column model forcings, using WRF- 3 D? Â  The standard WRF- 3 D simulation had an incorrect representation of the snow-cover and vegetation fraction, which deteriorates the conductive heat flux, the surface temperatures and the SBL evolution. Indeed, Chapter 3 highlighted the critical role of the land-surface coupling representation. Adjusting the settings with site specific information, improved model simulations compared with the observations. In general, the performance of WRF- 3 D was quite good for the selected cases,|$|R
2500|$|The {{largest single}} plant in Canada {{to use in}} situ {{production}} is Imperial Oil's Cold Lake oil sand plant. This plant uses a technique called cyclic steam injection. Using this method, the company pumps high-pressure steam into {{a section of the}} underground reservoir for a week or so, then pumps the liquid oil out for as long as several months. Imperial also uses steam-assisted <b>gravity</b> <b>drainage.</b> In its SAGD production system, Imperial drills two horizontal wells, one five metres above the other. Steam injected through the upper well reduces the viscosity of the oil, which is recovered through the lower borehole. This plant produces more than [...] of bitumen per day.|$|E
2500|$|Most of the Canadian {{oil sands}} are in three major {{deposits}} in northern Alberta. They are the Athabasca-Wabiskaw oil sands of north northeastern Alberta, the Cold Lake deposits of east northeastern Alberta, and the Peace River deposits of northwestern Alberta. Between them, they cover over â€”an area larger than Englandâ€”and contain approximately [...] of crude bitumen in them. About 10% {{of the oil}} in place, or , is estimated {{by the government of}} Alberta to be recoverable at current prices, using current technology, which amounts to 97% of Canadian oil reserves and 75% of total North American petroleum reserves. Although the Athabasca deposit is {{the only one in the}} world which has areas shallow enough to mine from the surface, all three Alberta areas are suitable for production using in-situ methods, such as cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) and steam assisted <b>gravity</b> <b>drainage</b> (SAGD).|$|E
2500|$|The {{magnitude}} of the resources {{in the two countries}} is on the order of 3.5 to 4 trillion barrels (550 to 650 billion cubic metres) of original oil in place (OOIP). Oil in place is not necessarily oil reserves, and the amount that can be produced depends on technological evolution. Rapid technological developments in Canada in the 1985â€“2000 period resulted in techniques such as steam-assisted <b>gravity</b> <b>drainage</b> (SAGD) [...] that can recover a much greater percentage of the OOIP than conventional methods. The Alberta government estimates that [...] with current technology, 10% of its bitumen and heavy oil [...] can be recovered, which would give it about 200 billion barrels (32 billion m3) of recoverable oil reserves. Venezuela estimates its recoverable oil at 267 billion barrels (42 billion m3). This places Canada and Venezuela in the same league as Saudi Arabia, having the three largest oil reserves in the world.|$|E
2500|$|By 2009, the two {{extraction}} {{methods used}} were in situ extraction, when the bitumen occurs deeper within the ground, (which {{will account for}} 80 percent of oil sands development) and surface or open-pit mining, when the bitumen {{is closer to the}} surface. Only 20 percent of bitumen can be extracted using open pit mining methods, which involves large scale excavation of the land with huge hydraulic power shovels and 400-ton heavy hauler trucks. Surface mining leaves toxic tailings ponds. In contrast, in situ uses more specialized techniques such as steam-assisted <b>gravity</b> <b>drainage</b> (SAGD). [...] "Eighty percent of the oil sands will be developed in situ which accounts for 97.5 percent of the total surface area of the oil sands region in Alberta." [...] In 2006 the Athabasca deposit was the only large oil sands reservoir in the world which was suitable for large-scale surface mining, although most of this reservoir can only be produced using more recently developed in-situ technology.|$|E
2500|$|Under an Act of Parliament of 1813, Commissioners were appointed, and {{improvements}} to the drainage included the first steam pumping engine. The Corporation of the Level of Hatfield Chase was established in 1862, and another pumping engine was installed. The drains ran to the north-eastern corner of the Chase, and continued to sluices at Althorpe on the River Trent. Discharge to the Trent was subsequently moved to Keadby, and the <b>gravity</b> <b>drainage</b> was supplemented by pumps when a pumping station was built in 1940. Steam engines were gradually replaced by diesel engines, and later by electric pumps. The Environment Agency maintain eight pumping stations on the Chase, in addition to Keadby, {{and there are a}} number of smaller installations managed by the Corporation of the Level of Hatfield Chase Internal Drainage Board. Some of the pumping stations are reversible, allowing water to be extracted from the drains into the main rivers in winter, and pumped from the rivers into the drains for irrigation in summer.|$|E
2500|$|Responsibility for {{the river}} and the flood defences of the {{surrounding}} countryside changed several times during the 20th century. Under the Land Drainage Act 1930, 47 Catchment Areas were defined, covering many of the river systems of England and Wales, including the Ancholme and Winterton Beck Catchment Area. A Catchment Board had been set up to manage the area by November 1931. The Catchment Board was replaced by the Lincolnshire River Board following the passing of the River Boards Act 1948, and the new board also had responsibility for the River Welland, the River Witham and the Steeping River. Land drainage functions became the responsibility of the Ancholme Internal Drainage Board from 1951. This was formed {{under the terms of the}} Land Drainage Act 1930, and manages an area of [...] containing [...] of maintained watercourses. Around half of the water falling on this area has to be pumped into the River Ancholme, because the land is too low-lying to allow <b>gravity</b> <b>drainage.</b> The IDB maintains 12 pumping stations on the banks of the river.|$|E
2500|$|The {{costs of}} {{production}} and transportation of saleable petroleum from oil sands is typically significantly higher than from conventional global sources. Hence the economic viability of oil sands production is more vulnerable {{to the price of}} oil. The price of benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil at Cushing, Oklahoma above US$100/bbl that prevailed until late 2014 was sufficient to promote active growth in oil sands production. Major Canadian oil companies had announced expansion plans and foreign companies were investing significant amounts of capital, in many cases forming partnerships with Canadian companies. Investment had been shifting towards in-situ steam assisted <b>gravity</b> <b>drainage</b> (SAGD) projects and away from mining and upgrading projects, as oil sands operators foresee better opportunities from selling bitumen and heavy oil directly to refineries than from upgrading it to synthetic crude oil. Cost estimates for Canada include the effects of the mining when the mines are returned to the environment in [...] "as good as or better than original condition". Cleanup of the end products of consumption are the responsibility of the consuming jurisdictions, which are mostly in provinces or countries other than the producing one.|$|E
