The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a strategy to effectively control plant disease with reduced use of dithiocarbamtes. Southern corn leaf blight was the model pathosystem for the investigation. When corn plants were drench-treated with Bacillus cereus C 1 L, a rhizobacterium able to induce systemic resistance in corn plants against southern leaf blight, frequency of spraying <b>dithiocarbamate</b> <b>fungicides</b> could be decreased. The treatment of B. cereus C 1 L was able to protect maize from southern leaf blight while residues of dithiocarbamates on leaf surface were too low to provide sufficient protection. On the other hand, frequent sprays of mancozeb slightly but significantly reduced growth of corn plants under natural conditions. In contrast, application of B. cereus C 1 L can significantly promote growth of corn plants whether sprayed with mancozeb or not. Our results provide the information that plant disease can be well controlled by rhizobacteria-mediated induced systemic resistance in combination with reduced but appropriate application of <b>dithiocarbamate</b> <b>fungicides</b> just before a heavy infection period. An appropriate use of rhizobacteria can enhance plant growth and help plants overcome negative effects caused by dithiocarbamates...|$|E

40|$|The {{etiology}} of Parkinson disease (PD) is unclear but may involve environmental toxins such as pesticides leading to dysfunction of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). Here, we measured the relative toxicity of ziram (a UPS inhibitor) and analogs to dopaminergic neurons {{and examined the}} mechanism of cell death. UPS (26 S) activity was measured in cell lines after exposure to ziram and related compounds. Dimethyl- and diethyldithiocarbamates including ziram were potent UPS inhibitors. Primary ventral mesencephalic cultures were exposed to ziram, and cell toxicity was assessed by staining for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and NeuN antigen. Ziram caused a preferential damage to TH+ neurons and elevated α-synuclein levels but did not increase aggregate formation. Mechanistically, ziram altered UPS function through interfering with the targeting of substrates by inhibiting ubiquitin E 1 ligase. Sodium dimethyldithiocarbamate administered to mice for 2 weeks resulted in persistent motor deficits and a mild reduction in striatal TH staining but no nigral cell loss.

The present study analyzes 976 chemicals (including failed pharmaceuticals, alternative plasticizers, food additives, and pesticides) in Phases I and II of the U. S. EPA’s ToxCast project across 331 cell-free enzymatic and ligand-binding high-throughput screening (HTS) assays. Half-maximal activity concentrations (AC 50) were identified for 729 chemicals in 256 assays (7, 135 chemical−assay pairs). Some of the most commonly affected assays were CYPs (CYP 2 C 9 and CYP 2 C 19), transporters (mitochondrial TSPO, norepinephrine, and dopaminergic), and GPCRs (aminergic). Heavy metals, surfactants, and <b>dithiocarbamate</b> <b>fungicides</b> showed promiscuous but distinctly different patterns of activity, whereas many of the pharmaceutical compounds showed promiscuous activity across GPCRs.

All mutants showed normal growth as compared to control isolates. atrB mutants displayed increased sensitivity to anilinopyrimidine, benzimidazole, phenylpyrrole, phenylpyridylamine, strobirulin and some azole fungicides. Increased sensitivity to the natural toxic compounds camptothecin (alkaloid), the phytoalexin resveratrol (stilbene) and the mutagen 4 -nitroquinoline oxide was also found. Overexpression mutants were less sensitive {{to a wide range}} of chemicals. In addition to the compounds mentioned above, decreased sensitivity to a broader range of azoles, dicarboximides, quintozene, acriflavine and rhodamine 6 G was observed. Decreased sensitivity in overexpression mutants negatively correlated with levels of atrB expression. Interestingly, the overexpression mutants displayed increased sensitivity to <b>dithiocarbamate</b> <b>fungicides,</b> chlorothalonil and the iron-activated antibiotic phleomycin. Accumulation of the azole fungicide [14 C]fenarimol by the overexpression mutants was lower as compared to the parental isolate, demonstrating that AtrBp acts by preventing intracellular accumulation of the toxicant.

The application of a fungicide which is a toxic substance applied either to prevent the growth of, or to kill fungi {{is one of the}} methods by which plant diseases are controlled. Ethylenebisdithiocarbamate fungicides are a group of surface acting fungicides which control a broad spectrum of fungi and their associated plant diseases. Mancozeb, also commonly known as Dithane, falls under the polymeric <b>Dithiocarbamate</b> <b>fungicides</b> which have several sites of toxicity to the fungal cell. The use of Mancozeb as a fungicide is increasing worldwide due to the advantages of low acute toxicity, low production and short environmental persistence. However, it has one major disadvantage, namely its lack of oxidative stability under ambient conditions. One of the objectives {{of this study was to}} characterize the Dithane samples supplied by Dow AgroSciences in terms of their active ingredient, metal and stabilizer content, and to study the thermal decomposition behaviour of Dithane. An attempt was made to correlate the active ingredient analyses with the TGA and DSC results to establish whether the thermal stability and active ingredient content of Dithane could be simultaneously determined by thermal analysis. This approach offered the attractive advantage of shorter analysis times thus allowing the elimination of the more tedious analytical methods employed by Dow AgroSciences. Furthermore, Fourier Transform infra-red characterization of Dithane samples and metal complexes containing HMT, Mn and/or Zn was carried out in order to identify the presence of functional groups and to gain some insight into the nature of the bonding of HMT, sulfate and water. A study of the nature of the bands in the FTIR spectra of these complexes was able to highlight the nature of the bonding but could not give confirmation of the structures of these complexes. In addition to this, the amount of HMT present in the said complexes was determined by the FTIR using the standard addition method. A final objective of the study was to investigate the reconstitution of Dithane by investigating the influence of the addition order of the various constituents on the stability of the final product. The addition order was found to have a definite influence on the thermal stability of the final product as well as on the percentage of fixed HMT in the product, and the kinetics of the Mn/Zn exchang...|$|E

Bibliography: leaves 54 - 58. ix, 58 l graphs, tablesThe {{appearance}} of phytotoxic symptoms following {{the application of}} <b>dithiocarbamate</b> <b>fungicides</b> {{has been reported in}} a number of instances. Delayed phytotoxicities such as leaf spotting in peach, pear, and apple, and leaf damage to tobacco, apple, and papaya have been observed following the application of dialkyldithiocarbamates but not with the monoalkyl analogs. This suggests that the two classes of fungicides are metabolized differently by plants. Study of the metabolism of dimethyldithiocarbamates in papaya was undertaken to assess the importance of the above observations. Dimethyldithiocarbamate (DDC) labeled with 14 C in the methyl groups or 35 S in the dithiocarbamate function was applied either as the potassium or zinc salt to leaves and roots of papaya seedlings from 1 to 3 months old. Surface residues, volatile metabolites, and translocated materials found in root, stem, leaf, and cell sap were assayed at various times after application of labeled compound. The results of this work show that part of the fungicidal residue is hydrolyzed on the surface, presumably to carbon disulfide and dimethylamine, both of which could be recovered as volatile metabolites. This hydrolysis is more rapid with the potassium salt than with the zinc salt presumably due to insolubility of the latter. An appreciable portion of the applied 35 S label has been found in sulfur amino acids (free and in proteins) and inorganic sulfate. Whether {{this is due to the}} oxidation of carbon disulfide or some dimethyldithiocarbamate metabolite is not known. In the case of methyl 14 C labeled compounds, carbon dioxide was collected as a volatile metabolite and 14 C was found in many plant constituents. The exact mechanism for the transformation of dimethy 1 amine methyl groups to carbon dioxide is unknown. Among the metabolites isolated, the largest amount of foliarly applied radioactivity (22 % for 14 c-KDDC and 11 % for 35 S-KDDC) was recovered from the cell sap as dimethyldithiocarbamy 1 glucoside, identified by paper chromatography and chemical analysis. Lesser amounts were present as dimethyldithiocarbamyl alanine and 4 other unidentified radioactive compounds. Recoveries of applied radioactivity ranged from 28 % to 55 % for 35 S-KDDC, from 33 % to 99 % for 14 c-KDDC, when applied to leaves. Phytotoxicity was never observed with the more rapidly decomposed KDDC whereas it was seen with Zn(DDC) 2. The available data indicate that a slow but prolonged evolution of carbon disulfide and dimethylamine on the leaf surface as observed with Zn(DDC) 2 may result in chronic poisoning of sensitive enzyme systems.

Although both substances had an effect in streams, differences were noticed {{in the nature of the}} affected traits suggesting that chemical mode of action plays a role in functional alterations. This was illustrated by the link between negative effects of chemical exposure on detritivorous taxa and reduced litter breakdown rate in streams. Therefore, characterisation of macroinvertebrate biological traits associated with the measurement of a functional process such as litter breakdown may provide a comprehensive understanding of the effects occurring in mesocosms exposed to organic chemicals...|$|R
40|$|Ecological risk {{assessment}} of chemicals in mesocosms requires measurement {{of a large}} number of parameters at the community level. Studies on invertebrate communities usually focus on taxonomic approaches, which only provide insights into taxonomic structure changes induced by chemicals. In the present study, abundance, biomass (B), theoretical production (P), and instantaneous P/B ratio were used as endpoints to assess the effects of the commercial form of the <b>dithiocarbamate</b> <b>fungicide</b> thiram (35 mu g/L and 170 mu g/L nominal concentrations) and of the hydrocarbon water accommodated fraction (HWAF) of a petroleum distillate (0. 01 mg/L, 0. 4 mg/L, 2 mg/L, and 20 mg/L loadings) on the zooplankton community in freshwater pond mesocosms. Endpoints were measured during a 4 -wk treatment period (1 pulse/wk) followed by a 5 -mo posttreatment period to evaluate zooplankton population recovery. The chlorophyll a concentration in water was significantly increased after treatment with HWAF, whereas it was not affected by thiram treatment. Zooplankton abundance-based analysis showed effects on a limited number of taxa, whereas other endpoints (mainly the P/B ratio) revealed that more taxa were impacted, with recovery depending on the chemical and concentration. Exposure to HWAF mainly had a negative impact on cladocerans, which resulted in top-down effects (between cladocerans and phytoplankton). Thiram negatively affected rotifers and copepods, suggesting more direct toxic effects. The results show that the use of secondary production as an endpoint provides a more comprehensive assessment of potential direct and indirect effects of chemicals on a community, and they also support evidence of alteration in functional processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{ecological}} {{impact of the}} <b>dithiocarbamate</b> <b>fungicide</b> metiram was studied in outdoor freshwater microcosms, consisting of 14 enclosures placed in an experimental ditch. The microcosms were treated three times (interval 7  days) with the formulated product BAS 222 28 F (Polyram®). Intended metiram concentrations in the overlying water were 0, 4, 12, 36, 108 and 324  μg a. i. /L. Responses of zooplankton, macroinvertebrates, phytoplankton, macrophytes, microbes and community metabolism endpoints were investigated. Dissipation half-life (DT 50) of metiram was approximately 1 – 6  h {{in the water column}} of the microcosm test system and the metabolites formed were not persistent. Multivariate analysis indicated treatment-related effects on the zooplankton (NOECcommunity =  36  μg a. i. /L). Consistent treatment-related effects on the phytoplankton and macroinvertebrate communities and on the sediment microbial community could not be demonstrated or were minor. There was no evidence that metiram affected the biomass, abundance or functioning of aquatic hyphomycetes on decomposing alder leaves. The most sensitive populations in the microcosms comprised representatives of Rotifera with a NOEC of 12  μg a. i. /L on isolated sampling days and a NOEC of 36  μg a. i. /L on consecutive samplings. At the highest treatment-level populations of Copepoda (zooplankton) and the blue-green alga Anabaena (phytoplankton) also showed a short-term decline on consecutive sampling days (NOEC =  108  μg a. i. /L). Indirect effects in the form of short-term increases in the abundance of a few macroinvertebrate and several phytoplankton taxa were also observed. The overall community and population level no-observed-effect concentration (NOECmicrocosm) was 12 – 36  μg a. i. /L. At higher treatment levels, including the test systems that received the highest dose, ecological recovery of affected measurement endpoints was fast (effect period <  8  weeks) ...|$|R
40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) is {{the second}} most common {{neurodegenerative}} disease, affecting seven to ten million people worldwide. Familial forms of PD account for 5 - 10 % of all PD cases suggesting that other factors such as the environment have a {{role in the development of}} sporadic cases of PD. Epidemiological studies have indicated that exposure to pesticides increases the risk for PD. Ziram, a <b>dithiocarbamate</b> <b>fungicide</b> commonly used in California, increases the risk of PD for individuals living and working in areas where the pesticide is sprayed. Ziram has previously been found in vitro to cause selective dopaminergic cell toxicity, inhibition of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), and increased α-synuclein (α-syn) levels in primary neuronal cultures. In this dissertation we utilize zebrafish embryos (ZF, Danio rerio) to study ziram in an in vivo system and to determine if ziram’s toxicity is mediated via synuclein. We found that ziram is toxic to ZF at nanomolar concentrations and caused selective loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons and impaired swimming behavior in ZF. Since ziram increases α-syn concentrations in rat primary neuronal cultures, we investigated the effect of ziram on ZF γ-synuclein 1 (γ 1). ZF express 3 synuclein isoforms and ZF γ 1 appears to be a functional homologue of α-syn. We found that recombinant ZF γ 1 formed fibrils in vitro and overexpression of ZF γ 1 in ZF embryos led to the formation of neuronal aggregates and neurotoxicity similarly to α-syn. Importantly, knockdown of ZF γ 1 with morpholinos or disruption of oligomers with the molecular tweezer CLR 01 protected against ziram’s DA toxicity. Over the course of this dissertation we have demonstrated that ziram is selectively toxic to DA neurons in vivo and that its toxicity is synuclein-dependent. These findings provide potentially important mechanistic implications on how ziram and possibly other environmental toxins can contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as PD...|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{populations of}} aminergic neurons are {{affected}} in Parkinson's disease (PD), with serotonergic and noradrenergic loci responsible for some non-motor symptoms. Environmental toxins, {{such as the}} <b>dithiocarbamate</b> <b>fungicide</b> ziram, significantly {{increase the risk of}} developing PD and the attendant spectrum of both motor and non-motor symptoms. The mechanisms by which ziram and other environmental toxins increase the risk of PD, and the potential effects of these toxins on aminergic neurons, remain unclear. To determine the relative effects of ziram on the synaptic function of aminergic versus non-aminergic neurons, we used live-imaging at the Drosophila melanogaster larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ). In contrast to nearly all other studies of this model synapse, we imaged presynaptic function at both glutamatergic Type Ib and aminergic Type II boutons, the latter responsible for storage and release of octopamine, the invertebrate equivalent of noradrenalin. To quantify the kinetics of exo- and endo- cytosis, we employed an acid-sensitive form of GFP fused to the Drosophila vesicular monoamine transporter (DVMAT-pHluorin). Additional genetic probes were used to visualize intracellular calcium flux (GCaMP) and voltage changes (ArcLight). We find that at glutamatergic Type Ib terminals, exposure to ziram increases exocytosis and inhibits endocytosis. By contrast, at octopaminergic Type II terminals, ziram has no detectable effect on exocytosis and dramatically inhibits endocytosis. In contrast to other reports on the neuronal effects of ziram, these effects do not appear to result from perturbation of the UPS or calcium homeostasis. Unexpectedly, ziram also caused spontaneous and synchronized bursts of calcium influx (measured by GCaMP) and electrical activity (measured by ArcLight) at aminergic Type II, but not glutamatergic Type Ib, nerve terminals. These events are sensitive to both tetrodotoxin and cadmium chloride, and thus appear to represent spontaneous depolarizations followed by calcium influx into Type II terminals. We speculate that the differential effects of ziram on Type II versus Type Ib terminals may be relevant to the specific sensitivity of aminergic neurons in PD, and suggest that changes neuronal excitability could contribute to the increased risk for PD caused by exposure to ziram. We also suggest that the fly NMJ will be useful to explore the synaptic effects of other pesticides associated with an increased risk of PD...|$|R
40|$|Ethylenethiourea (ETU) and propylenethiourea (PTU) are {{the main}} {{degradation}} products of <b>dithiocarbamates</b> <b>fungicides,</b> which are widely used in agriculture from several years ago. Their determination in water at low concentrations (e. g. sub-ppb levels) is highly problematic due to their polar character and low molecular size. In the present study, two analytical methodologies have been developed and compared for the selective and sensitive determination of ETU and PTU in various types of waters. Both approaches are based on liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) with electrospray ionization, using triple quadrupole analyzer. Whereas the first methodology used an on-line solid-phase extraction (SPE) step {{in order to reach}} the adequate sensitivity, the second one avoided sample treatment and was based on direct injection into an ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC–MS/MS) system, making use of a new-generation instrument in order to reach sub-ppb analyte levels in water. Strong matrix effects (typically leading to signal enhancement) were observed for most of the evaluated waters, especially when applying the on-line SPE method, surely due to the higher amount of sample injected into the system. The use of the own analyte (ETU-d 4) as isotope-labelled internal standard (ILIS) allowed to compensate these effects and to achieve an accurate ETU quantification at low concentrations. Moreover, three simultaneous transitions, operating in selected reaction monitoring mode, were acquired for both ETU and ETU-d 4. This fact together with the evaluation of their relative intensity ratios assured the reliable identification of the analyte in the water samples. The two optimized methodologies were validated by analysis of six different samples (two drinking water, two groundwater and two surface water), spiked at two levels (0. 1 and 1. 0 μg/L), and analyzed each in quintuplicate. Satisfactory accuracy and precision, with recoveries ranging from 73 to 104 % and RSDs lower than 20 %, were obtained for ETU. Limits of detection for ETU were found to be 0. 058 μg/L and 0. 027 μg/L with direct injection and with the on-line methodology, respectively. No satisfactory recoveries were obtained, in general, for PTU despite using its own deuterium-labelled molecule for matrix effects correction. Notable differences in the chemical behaviour between PTU and PTU-d 6 were observed, which lead to significant variation in their chromatographic retention time and ionization efficiency. Thus, no satisfactory correction of matrix effects could be reached illustrating that the use of deuterated ILIS can be problematic in some particular cases. Despite the poor correction, a semi-quantitative analysis would be feasible for PTU at sub-ppb levels in water. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first article reporting the use of LC–MS/MS for the trace level determination of these problematic analytes in water...|$|R
40|$|This report {{compares the}} antifertility {{activities}} in laying hens of various <b>dithiocarbamates</b> including the <b>fungicides</b> thiram, ziram, zineb, maneb and ferbam, and the alcohol deterrent anta-buse. Ziram at 200 ppm {{in the diet}} or thiram at 125 ppm stopped egg production within 2 days and caused marked ovarian atrophy after 7 days. Ferbam at levels between 200 and 600 ppm and antabuse at levels between 125 and 500 ppm reduced but did not eliminate egg production and caused only slight ovarian regression. In contrast, zineb and maneb were without effect when tested at 600 ppm. The antifertility effects of thiram were fully reversible, since hens treated with 250 ppm for either 10 or 14 days resumed egg production after treatment, and within 5 weeks exceeded their rate of production prior to treatment. Additionally {{it was found that}} daily injec-tions of porcine FSH could reverse the antigonadal effect of thiram, and a single injection of LIIRII could overcome its anovulatory effect. Reversal by LHRH suggests that thiram might block fertility by an action within the central nervous system...|$|R
40|$|<b>Dithiocarbamates</b> (DTCs) are <b>fungicides</b> {{that require}} a {{specific}} single-residue method for detection and verification of compliance with maximum residue limits (MRLs) as established for fruit and vegetables in the EU. In this study, the use of ambient mass spectrometry was investigated for specific determination of individual DTCs (thiram, ziram) in fruit. Two complementary approaches have been investigated for their rapid analysis: (i) direct analysis in real time (DART) combined with medium-high resolution/accurate mass time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS) and high-resolution/accurate mass Orbitrap MS, and (ii) desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) combined with tandem-in-time mass spectrometry (MS 2). With both techniques, thiram deposited on a glass surface (DART) or Teflon (DESI) could be directly detected. With DART, this was also possible for ziram. Before the instrumental analysis of fruit matrix, an extract had to be prepared following a straightforward procedure. The raw extracts were deposited on a slide (DESI), or rods were dipped into the extracts (DART), after which thiram and ziram could be rapidly detected (typically 10 samples in a few minutes). In the case of thiram, the lowest calibration levels were 1 ¿mg¿kg- 1 (DART–TOFMS, DESI–MS 2) and 0. 1 ¿mg¿kg- 1 (DART–Orbitrap MS). For ziram, the achieved lowest calibration levels were 0. 5 ¿mg¿kg- 1 (DART–TOFMS) and 1 ¿mg¿kg- 1 (DART–Orbitrap MS).
