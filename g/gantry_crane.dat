5000|$|Ship-to-shore <b>gantry</b> <b>cranes</b> {{are often}} used in pairs or teams of cranes in order to {{minimize}} the time required to load and unload vessels. As container ship sizes and widths have increased throughout the 20th Century, ship-to-shore <b>gantry</b> <b>cranes</b> and the implementation of ship-to-shore <b>gantry</b> <b>cranes</b> has become more unique in order to effectively load and unload vessels while maximizing profitability and minimizing time in port. One example are systems where specialized berths built that accommodate one vessel at a time with ship-to-shore <b>gantry</b> <b>cranes</b> {{on both sides of the}} vessel. This allows for more cranes and double the workspace under the cranes to be used for transporting cargo off dock.|$|R
25|$|The August 2008 fatal {{incident}} {{was preceded by}} two other deaths involving demolition of the main <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> at the shipyard on 26 January 2005. The earlier incident resulted in an OSHA ruling against Testa Corporation of Lynnfield, Massachusetts, including a proposed $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars) fine. Following the 2005 collapse, violations involving improper cleanup and removal of asbestos found in debris left by the accident resulted in a $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars) penalty imposed against Testa by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection.|$|E
25|$|The {{refueling}} {{machine is}} mounted on a <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> and remotely controlled. The fuel assemblies can be replaced without shutting down the reactor, a factor significant for production of weapon-grade plutonium and, in a civilian context, for better reactor uptime. When a fuel assembly has to be replaced, the machine is positioned above the fuel channel, mates to it, equalizes pressure within, pulls the rod, and inserts a fresh one. The spent rod is then placed in a cooling pond. The capacity of the refueling machine with the reactor at nominal power level is two fuel assemblies per day, with peak capacity of five per day.|$|E
25|$|Belfast's skyline {{is still}} {{dominated}} today by Harland & Wolff's famous twin gantry cranes, Samson and Goliath, built in 1974 and 1969 respectively. There is also speculation about a resurgence in {{the prosperity of}} the shipyard thanks to the company's diversification into emerging technologies, particularly in renewable energy development, such as offshore wind turbine and tidal power construction, which may {{provide an opportunity to}} further improve the company's fortunes in the long term. For example, the United Kingdom planned to build 7,500 new offshore wind turbines between 2008 and 2020, creating great demand for heavy assembly work. Unlike land-based wind turbines, where assembly occurs on site, offshore wind turbines have part of their assembly done in a shipyard, and then construction barges transport the tower sections, rotors, and nacelles to the site for final erection and assembly. As a result of this, in late 2007, the 'Goliath' <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> was re-commissioned, having been moth-balled in 2003 {{due to the lack of}} heavy-lifting work at the yard.|$|E

500|$|Construction on {{the road}} system began in 1956, and the {{contract}} for construction of the bridge was signed by Commissioner of Main Roads J. Digby Leach on 16 March 1957. The bridge was built by Danish firm Christiani and Nielsen in conjunction with Western Australian engineering firm J. O. Clough & Son. Leif Ott Nilsen oversaw construction on behalf of Christiani and Nielsen. The first timber pile for the temporary staging for the construction was driven at noon on 8 June 1957. The first permanent pile for the bridge was driven home on 18 August 1957.

500|$|Like Hōshō, Hermes {{was based}} on a cruiser-type hull and she was {{initially}} designed to carry both wheeled aircraft and seaplanes. The ship's design was derived from a 1916 seaplane carrier design by Gerard Holmes and Sir John Biles, but was considerably enlarged by Sir Eustace d'Eyncourt, the Director of Naval Construction (DNC), in his April 1917 sketch design. Her most notable feature was the seaplane slipway that comprised three sections. The seaplanes would taxi onto the rigid submerged portion aft and dock with a trolley that would carry the aircraft into the hangar. A flexible submerged portion separated the rear section from the rigid forward portion of the slipway to prevent the submerged part from rolling with the ship's motion. The entire slipway could be retracted into the ship, and a <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> ran the length of the slipway to help recover the seaplanes. The design showed two islands with the full-length flight deck running between them. Each island contained one funnel; a large net could be strung between them to stop out-of-control aircraft. Aircraft were transported between the hangar and the flight deck by two aircraft lifts (elevators); the forward lift measured [...] and the rear [...] This design displaced [...] and accommodated six large Short Type 184 seaplanes and six smaller Sopwith Baby seaplanes. The ship's armament consisted of six [...] guns.|$|E

2500|$|On April 24, 2013, the Port Authority's Board of Commissioners {{awarded a}} $743.3 million {{contract}} {{to a joint}} venture of Skanska Koch and Kiewit Infrastructure Company.
