Physicians with defibrillators rushing through the city to reach a non-breathing, unconscious person whose heart had stopped were quite unusual by 1968 standards.

Using mathematical methods he experimented with various designs until {{he arrived at}} a shape cast from {{a single piece of}} iron, an improvement on the Scots plough of James Anderson of Hermiston. A single-piece cast iron plough was also developed and patented by Charles Newbold in the United States. This was again improved on by Jethro Wood, a blacksmith of Scipio, New York, who made a three-part Scots Plough that allowed a broken piece to be replaced. In 1837 John Deere introduced the first steel plough; it was so much stronger than iron designs that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> soil in areas of the US that had previously been considered unsuitable for farming.|$|E

Upon her return, Ruchoma told Bessie about her desire to buy an apartment there, and Bessie also expressed interest in buying an apartment.

Ayola commented on their previous relationship: [...] "I think they split up because Kyla is so volatile. The more we learn about Harvey the more I think he might not be the reason for their split". She expanded: [...] "They had a tempestuous relationship and Kyla is very irrational which got too much for Harvey. Harvey brings out the worst in Kyla and she just ends up yelling at him.

Originally, the song {{did not have a}} chorus and Robyn noted that Bruna's version [...] "sounded very different" [...] from her own. Robyn's version {{was one of the first}} songs recorded for the Body Talk series, but she decided to save it for a later release to give it a chance of becoming a single. In an interview with Gary Graff of The Macomb Daily, she spoke of covering Bruna's song and altering the lyrics, [...] "It didn’t have a chorus when we started working on it.

2500|$|If {{one of the}} {{two events}} {{represents}} the sending of a signal from one location and the second event represents the reception of the same signal at another location, then as long as the signal is moving {{at the speed of light}} or slower, the mathematics of simultaneity ensures that all reference frames agree that the transmission-event happened before the reception-event. However, in the case of a hypothetical signal moving faster than light, there would always be some frames in which the signal was received before it was sent so that the signal could be said to have moved backward in time. Because {{one of the two}} fundamental postulates of special relativity says that the laws of physics should work the same way in every inertial frame, if it is possible for signals to move backward in time in any one frame, it must be possible in all frames. This means that if observer A sends a signal to observer B which moves faster than light in A's frame but backwards in time in B's frame, and then B sends a reply which moves faster than light in B's frame but backwards in time in A's frame, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> out that A receives the reply before sending the original signal, challenging causality in every frame and opening the door to severe logical paradoxes.
