40|$|AbstractThe {{commercial}} greenhouse {{is one of}} {{the most}} effective cultivation methods with a yield per cultivated area up to 10 times more than free land cultivation but the use of fossil fuels in this production field is very high. The objectives of this paper are to modeling and experimental evaluation of heat and mass transfer functions in an innovative solar greenhouse with thermal screen. For this propose, a semi-solar greenhouse was designed and constructed at the North-West of Iran in Azerbaijan Province (38 ° 10 ′N and 46 ° 18 ′E with elevation of 1364 m above the sea level). The inside environment factors include <b>inside</b> air <b>temperature</b> below screen (Ta), <b>inside</b> air <b>temperature</b> above screen (Tas), crop <b>temperature</b> (Tc), <b>inside</b> soil <b>temperature</b> (Ts), cover temperature (Tri) and thermal screen temperature (Tsc) were collected as the experimental data samples. The dynamic heat and mass transfer model used to estimate the temperature in six different points of the semi-solar greenhouse with initial values and consider the crop evapotranspiration. The results showed that dynamic model can predict the <b>inside</b> <b>temperatures</b> in four different points (Ta, Tc, Tri, Ts) with MAPE, RMSE and EF about 5 – 7 %, 1 – 2 °C and 80 – 91 % for greenhouse without thermal screen and about 3 – 7 %, 0. 6 – 1. 8 °C and 89 – 96 % for six different points of greenhouse with thermal screen (Ta, Tc, Tri, Ts, Tas, Tsc), respectively. The results of using thermal screen at night (12 h) in autumn showed that this method can decrease the use of fossil fuels up to 58 % and so decrease the final cost and air pollution. This movable insulation caused about 15 °C difference between outside and <b>inside</b> air <b>temperature</b> and also made about 6 °C difference between Ta and Tas. The experimental results showed that inside thermal screen can decrease the crop temperature fluctuation at night...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the thermal behaviour of a non‐airconditioned building with walls/roof being exposed to periodic solar radiation and atmospheric air while the <b>inside</b> air <b>temperature</b> is controlled by an isothermal mass, window and door in the walls of the room. The effects of air ventilation and infiltration, the heat capacities of the isothermal storage mass inside air and walls/roof, heat loss into the ground, and the presence/absence of the window/door have been incorporated in the realistic time dependent periodic heat transfer analysis to evaluate the overall heat flux coming into the room and the <b>inside</b> air <b>temperature.</b> A numerical computer model using typical weather data for Delhi has been made to appreciate the analytical results quantitatively. It is found that the heat fluxes through different walls have different magnitudes and phase lags w. r. t. the corresponding solair temperatures. The overall heat flux coming into the room as well as the room air temperature are sensitive functions of the number of air changes per hour, closing/opening of the window and the door ventilation. The effects of the heat capacity of the isothermal mass and the basement ground are found to reduce the <b>inside</b> air <b>temperature</b> swing and the presence of a window is found to increase the <b>inside</b> air <b>temperature</b> even when the window area is much smaller than the wall/roof area. The model presented would be an aid to a building architect for good thermal design of non‐airconditioned buildings. Copyrigh...|$|R

It also must have a way that the astronauts would not be knocked around during launch or reentry. Additionally, since the inside will be weightless, there must be a way for the astronauts to stay in their seats during the flight. For this each seat has a system of straps and buckles.

50|$|In {{addition}} to being an inexpensive material with a small resource cost, adobe {{can serve as a}} significant heat reservoir due to the thermal properties inherent in the massive walls typical in adobe construction. In climates typified by hot days and cool nights, the high thermal mass of adobe mediates the high and low temperatures of the day, moderating the living space temperature. The massive walls require a large and relatively long input of heat from the sun (radiation) and from the surrounding air (convection) before they warm through to the interior. After the sun sets and the temperature drops, the warm wall will then continue to transfer heat to the interior for several hours due to the time-lag effect. Thus, a well-planned adobe wall of the appropriate thickness is very effective at controlling <b>inside</b> <b>temperature</b> through the wide daily fluctuations typical of desert climates, a factor which has contributed to its longevity as a building material.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike other tunable lasers {{that have}} a single cavity that is {{adjusted}} to change the wavelength, Santur used an array of 12 or 14 lasers, each at a different wavelength, all fabricated on a single chip at about a ten micrometre pitch. Simply switching between lasers changes the wavelength in a coarse manner. Like most wavelength controlled telecommunication lasers, the laser chip is mounted on a thermoelectric cooler to stabilize the temperature. By making small adjustments to the <b>inside</b> <b>temperature</b> of the package, fine tuning of the wavelength can be realized. Additionally, the Santur laser package contains a micromechanical mirror that deflects in both x and y axes in order to couple the laser beam to the output fiber. This [...] "switch" [...] is necessary since each laser of the array emits at a different output aperture. [...] The micromechanical mirror loosens tolerances needed for packaging and allows the assembly to be put together with coarse tolerances and aligned electronically.|$|E
