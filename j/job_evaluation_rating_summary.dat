40|$|The {{doctrine}} of comparable worth rests on {{an assumption that}} each job possesses an inherent worth independent of the market forces of supply and demand. Implementation of comparable worth further requires that inherentjob worth be measured with reasonable accuracy. This paper reports {{the results of an}} experimental study of comparable worth. Three commercial <b>job</b> <b>evaluation</b> firms <b>rated</b> the same set of 27 jobs in an actual company. Statistical analysis of the experimental data indicates that the three evaluators differed in which job trait, or constel-lation of traits, they used to evaluate inherent job worth, implying {{that at least one of}} them failed to measure inherent job worth accurately.

40|$|Abstract Primary {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to study how <b>job</b> <b>evaluation</b> can be utilized in competency management in a contemporary knowledge-intensive organization. The subject of the study lacks recent research since <b>job</b> <b>evaluation</b> dates back to era of scientific management. The problem is studied from team managers’ perspective because they are key users of <b>job</b> <b>evaluation</b> and most influential actors in daily competency management activities. The research aims to bring understanding and new viewpoints on using <b>job</b> <b>evaluation</b> in a modern organization. Theory of the research builds on theories of competency management and <b>job</b> <b>evaluation.</b> The proposed theoretical framework studies the practice of <b>job</b> <b>evaluation</b> in the context of competency management. The framework recognizes different viewpoints of top management and employees, placing team managers in the middle. Theory of competency management studies both the managerial perspective and employee needs. The research is conducted in action research method. During the research the researcher is actively involved in a development project of a <b>job</b> <b>evaluation</b> system. Research data is gathered along the project and in one additional research interview, which focuses on team managers’ use of <b>job</b> <b>evaluation</b> in competency management. The research follows the structure of action research process including three separable research cycles. <b>Job</b> <b>evaluation</b> does provide valuable information for competency management practices such as recruitment, career planning, and performance appraisal. However, recognition of these possibilities is still rather weak among team managers. The research proves the importance of team manager involvement in <b>job</b> <b>evaluation</b> and confirms the existence of contradictory expectations of managers and employees. Employees’ needs for appreciation and justice are highlighted, which requires attention from management. Contemporary use of <b>job</b> <b>evaluation</b> requires change in attitudes and awareness, which can be achieved through cultural change. Team managers are key users of the system and top management should actively manage team managers’ experience to gain acceptance. Besides pay determination, <b>job</b> <b>evaluation</b> provides a tool for communicating job expectations and evaluating performance.
