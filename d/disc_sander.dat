5000|$|The Shopsmith is a lathe-based {{multi-tool}} {{that uses}} a single motor to perform lathe, tablesaw, sanding, and drill press functions. Variations include horizontal boring and <b>disc</b> <b>sander.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Disc sander: A <b>disc</b> <b>sander</b> is most {{commonly}} implemented as a stationary machine {{that consists of}} a replaceable circular shaped sandpaper attached to a wheel turned by an electric motor or compressed air. The usually wooden work piece, (although other materials can be shaped and worked on such as plastics, metals and other soft materials), is sat on a front bench that can be adjusted to various angles. It {{can be used for}} rough or fine sanding depending on the sanding grit used.|$|E
30|$|This method {{combines}} {{two methods}} mentioned above. It takes the same measurements as Disc Model, but approximates volume by 40  mm or 10  mm high truncated cones instead of equidistant <b>discs</b> (Fig.  5) (<b>Sander</b> et al. 2002). The equation used at Frustum Sign Model was used.|$|R
50|$|A {{belt sander}} is a sander used in shaping and {{finishing}} wood and other materials. It {{consists of an}} electric motor that turns a pair of drums on which a continuous loop of sandpaper is mounted. Belt sanders may be handheld and moved over the material, or stationary (fixed), where the material is moved to the sanding belt. Stationary belt sanders are sometimes mounted on a work bench, in which case they are called bench sanders. Stationary belt sanders are often combined with a <b>disc</b> <b>sander.</b>|$|E
50|$|All modern sanding {{projects}} are completed with specialized sanding machines. The majority of material is removed by large 220 volt belt or drum sander. Belt sanders are preferred for the continuous sand paper belt design to prevent sanding machine marks in floors. The belt sander {{was invented by}} Eugen Laegler in 1969 out of Güglingen, Germany. 90% of the area can be reached with the belt/drum sander. The remaining 10% left such as edges, corners, under cabinets, and stairs, are sanded by an edge sanding machine. A finishing machine known as a multi <b>disc</b> <b>sander</b> or buffer is then used for the final sanding steps.|$|E
50|$|Shopsmith has {{its origins}} in the ShopSmith 10ER tool, a five-in-one {{woodworking}} tool for do-it-yourself consumers invented in the late 1940s by Hans Goldschmidt, an immigrant from Germany.It found a ready market among new homeowners in the period after World War II (1939-45).The compact ShopSmith 10ER combined a table saw, lathe, drill press, <b>disc</b> <b>sander</b> and horizontal boring machine.It was manufactured by Goldschmidt’s Magna Engineering Corporation of San Diego, California.Successive models included additional accessories such as a bandsaw, jigsaw, jointer and belt sander.The lawn and garden tool manufacturer Yuba Power Products of Cleveland, Ohio bought Magna and the ShopSmith product line in the late 1950s.A few years later a group of Yuba employees founded Magna American Corporation and purchased the ShopSmith brand.They started manufacturing in Raymond, Mississippi, but their company had ceased operation by 1966.|$|E
40|$|There {{are various}} forms {{and types of}} {{machines}} on the market sander, but that underlie the differences in types and sizes of functions and sizes of material, amounting to what materials will be crushed, there can be determined to use which. For materials with small sizes {{that can only be}} held by the fingers then it is advisable to use a big machine like the one in the Lab. Sisman The problem faced by the operators with the type of sander machine MODEL 6 "Belt and 9 " <b>Disc</b> <b>Sander,</b> NS: 121 001 113 existing in the Lab. Juruasn manufacturing system engineering in industrial engineering is the position operator, at operator's position in the machine do the work stands beside the machine and the operator's position must operate in a standing position which causes rapid operator to feel tired. Felt fatigue in the legs because as long as the machine operators to operate in conditions as well as the perceived standing on the waist because {{at the time of the}} material making process operator must rotate his body to reach the material or materials to be mashed. From the problems that the author gives a solution that is designing a chair that could fix the problem condition. Chair design must be able to make the operator does not quickly feel tired and can reduce the pain felt at the waist as before with the design of the rotating chair and pedestal seat or seats and footrests which can fluctuate by 10 cm with a view to the operator that has a size of more larger or smaller than could persentile adjustable. To achieve the required anthropometric data: height knee, thigh length, width, hip and elbow height in a sitting position, in order to design a machine operator chair Ergonomic sander...|$|E
