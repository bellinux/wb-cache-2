40|$|The {{dispersion}} relation for seismoelectric {{wave propagation}} in poroelastic media is formulated {{in terms of}} effective densities comprising all viscous and electrokinetic coupling effects. Using Helmholtz decomposition, two seismoelectric conversion coefficients are derived, for an incident P-wave upon an interface between a compressible fluid and a poroelastic medium. These coefficients relate the incident P-wave to a reflected electromagnetic wave in the fluid, and a transmitted electromagnetic wave in the porous medium. The dependency on angle of incidence and frequency is computed. Using orthodox and <b>interference</b> <b>fluxes,</b> it is shown that energy conservation is satisfied. A sensitivity analysis indicates that electrolyte concentration, viscosity, and permeability highly influence seismoelectric conversion. GeotechnologyCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

Candidate stars are found on near-IR objective-prism plates, and confirming observations are made with near-IR narrowband photometry and medium-resolution CCD spectroscopy. The fluxes of 36 southern and equatorial standard stars for the eight-color narrowband system are given. The way in which stars are classified in temperature and luminosity type, {{and the way the}} photometry is used to derive distances and reddening are shown.

The amplitude of the resonant peaks and dips are modulated {{by the power of}} the applied microwave irradiation and a population inversion is generated at low flux bias. These results, which can be addressed with Landau-Zener transition, are useful to develop an alternative means to initialize and manipulate the flux qubit, as well as to do a controllable population inversion used in a micromaser.

40|$|Partial wave {{theory of}} a three dmensional {{scattering}} problem for an arbitray short range potential and a nonlocal Aharonov-Bohm magnetic flux is established. The scattering process of a ``hard shere'' like potential and the magnetic flux is examined. An anomalous {{total cross section}} is revealed at the specific quantized magnetic flux at low energy which helps explain the composite fermion and boson model in the fractional quantum Hall effect. Since the nonlocal quantum <b>interference</b> of magnetic <b>flux</b> on the charged particles is universal, the nonlocal effect is expected to appear in quite general potential system and will be useful in understanding some other phenomena in mesoscopic phyiscs.

40|$|We report {{observations}} {{and analysis of}} flux monitoring of Sagittarius A* at 3 -mm wavelength using the OVRO millimeter interferometer {{over a period of}} eight days (2002 May 23 - 30). Frequent phase and flux referencing (every 5 minutes) with the nearby calibrator source J 1744 - 312 was employed to control for instrumental and atmospheric effects. Time variations are sought by computing and subtracting, from each visibility in the database, an average visibility obtained from all the data acquired in our monitoring program having similar uv spacings. This removes the confusing effects of baseline-dependent, correlated <b>flux</b> <b>interference</b> caused by the static, thermal emission from the extended source Sgr A West.

40|$|According to the Aharonov-Bohm effect, {{magnetic}} potentials have {{a direct}} significance to the motion of particles in quantum mechanics. We study this quantum effect through the scattering by several point-like magnetic fields at large separation in two dimensions. We derive the asymptotic formula for scattering amplitudes as the distances between centers of fields go to infinity. The result heavily depends on the location of centers. A special {{emphasis is placed on}} the case of scattering by fields with centers on an even line. The obtained formula depends on fluxes of fields and on ratios of distances between adjacent centers. We figure the approximate values of differential cross sections to see how the pattern of <b>interferences</b> changes with <b>flux</b> parameters...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} for {{analysing}} {{the contents of}} many metalic elements, such as Ta, Nb, Sn, Ti, W, Fe, Mn, Al, Ph, Ce, Y, Sc, Pr, Sm, Nd, U, Th etc, in refractory tantalum-niobium slag by ICP-AES was developed. The samples processing procedures involve two steps, being first decomposed by potassium carbonate and boric acid at 950 degrees C for 15 min, then leached by hydrochloride and tartaric acid at 90 degrees C for 30 min. The <b>interference</b> of <b>flux</b> and tin matrix in analyzing the other elements was eliminated by the utilization of matrix matching method. This method showed satisfactory precision and accuracy with the RSDs between 0. 27 % and 5. 48 % and the recovery rates between 94. 0 % and 109. 6 %. The analysis results indicated that highly valuable metals of Sn, Ta, Nb, Ti, W and Ce are rich in the refractory tantalum-niobium slag, showing that it has the great potential for comprehensive utilization. However, the analysis result also showed that the slag is a radioactive pollution source due to {{a small amount of}} U and Th. This method is simple and fast, and has the advantage of analyzing many elements simultaneously. The accurate analytic results provided a basis for the future researches on the comprehensive utilization of refractory tantalum-niobium slag...|$|R
40|$|Electroacoustic {{techniques}} are promising tools {{for the size}} determination and electrokinetic characterization of concentrated colloidal suspensions. When particles are not homogeneous in size and/or density, the dynamic mobility obtained {{is a kind of}} average of the mobilities of every particle. In this paper, we try to discern which averaging procedure provides a better description of the dynamic mobility of bidisperse suspensions consisting of a mixture of two very different types of particles. The results show that the amplitude of the sound wave induced by an applied ac field (electrokinetic sonic amplitude) is not just the sum of the amplitudes of the waves generated by every particle but has a larger contribution from the larger particles, although the small size entities considerably influence the behaviour of the latter because of their <b>interference</b> in the <b>fluxes</b> of the fluid and ions around them...|$|R
30|$|Over the years, we {{have found}} it {{difficult}} to quantify uncertainties in FFC CO 2 emissions (Andres et al. 2012; Olivier et al. 2014), and the inverse modelling community is well informed about some of the <b>interference</b> on <b>flux</b> inversions (Gurney et al. 2005; Peylin et al. 2011). Clearly the maximum uncertainty in FFC CO 2 emissions is found for China (Guan et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2015; Korsbakken et al. 2016). A biased higher or lower FFC CO 2 emission will lead to artificially stronger (weaker) biospheric CO 2 sink over a given land region. In the recent times, the inverse model results are post-processed by applying a FFC CO 2 emission correction term (Peylin et al. 2013; Thompson et al. 2016). This method is a good approximation when biases in assumed FFC CO 2 emission only influence land CO 2 flux of the same region, but this is probably not the case because our regional fluxes are poorly constrained by observational data (Saeki et al. 2017; Thompson et al. 2016). However, the effect of high/low bias in the rate of FFC CO 2 emission increase on the decadal variations of inversion estimated terrestrial CO 2 uptake has not been discussed in detail (Patra et al. 2016 a). Because the model transport biases do not vary significantly from year to year, our inversion systems can better constrain the interannual/decadal variation in land fluxes compared to their magnitude, provided an accurate estimation of FFC CO 2 emissions is available.|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} ways of {{investigating}} flux lines with polarised neutrons. We shall describe our recent work on IN 15 at ILL, investigating spatially varying fields perpendicular to the fluxoid axes, which are present with tilted fields in anisotropic superconductors. These field components may be detected by polarisation analysis of neutrons diffracted by the flux line lattice, and allow a detailed investigation of flux structure in such materials as YBCO and NbSe 2. A further application of polarised neutrons {{is the use of}} neutron spin-echo techniques to measure the speed of moving flux lines. We have recently demonstrated this in an Nb-Ta alloy on instruments IN 11 and IN 15, by measuring the energy change of neutrons diffracted by flux lines, which are moving under the influence of a transport current. We shall also comment on others' work on the search for <b>interference</b> terms between <b>flux</b> lattice and nuclear diffraction signals, and the use of neutron depolarisation for investigation of flux distributions in superconductors.

It {{was found that the}} quenching probabilities have some oscillatory structures due to the <b>interference</b> of reflected <b>flux</b> in the Br(P- 2 (1 / 2)) + H- 2 and Br(P- 2 (3 / 2)) + H- 2 channels by repulsive potential in the near-resonant electronic-to-vibrational energy transfer process. The final vibrational state resolved integral cross sections were found to be dominated by the quenching process Br(P- 2 (1 / 2)) + H- 2 (nu) -> Br(P- 2 (3 / 2)) + H- 2 (nu+ 1) and the nonadiabatic reaction probabilities for Br(P- 2 (1 / 2)) + H- 2 (nu = 0, 1, j(i) = 0) are quite small, which are consistent with previous theoretical and experimental results. Our calculated total quenching rate constant for Br(P- 2 (1 / 2)) + H- 2 (nu(i) = 0, j(i) = 0) at room temperature is in good agreement with the available experimental data.

40|$|The model marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum can {{accumulate}} {{high levels}} of triacylglycerols (TAGs) under nitrogen depletion and has attracted increasing attention as a potential system for biofuel production. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in TAG accumulation in diatoms are largely unknown. Here, we employed a label-free quantitative proteomics approach to estimate differences in protein abundance before and after TAG accumulation. We identified a total of 1193 proteins, 258 of which were significantly altered during TAG accumulation. Data analysis revealed major changes in proteins involved in branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolic processes, glycolysis, and lipid metabolic processes. Subsequent quantitative RT-PCR and protein gel blot analysis confirmed that four genes associated with BCAA degradation were significantly upregulated at both the mRNA and protein levels during TAG accumulation. The most significantly upregulated gene, encoding the β-subunit of methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC 2), was selected for further functional studies. Inhibition of MCC 2 expression by RNA <b>interference</b> disturbed the <b>flux</b> of carbon (mainly {{in the form of}} leucine) toward BCAA degradation, resulting in decreased TAG accumulation. MCC 2 inhibition also gave rise to incomplete utilization of nitrogen, thus lowering biomass during the stationary growth phase. These findings help elucidate the molecular and metabolic mechanisms leading to increased lipid production in diatoms...|$|R
40|$|A {{system has}} been {{developed}} to directly measure isoprene flux above a forest canopy by eddy covariance using {{the combination of a}} fast response, real-time isoprene sensor and sonic anemometer. This system is suitable for making nearly unattended, long-term and continuous measurements of isoprene fluxes. Isoprene detection is based on chemiluminescence between isoprene and reactant ozone, which produces green light at 500 nm. The sensor has a noise level (1 σ) of 450 pptv for a 1 -s integration which is dominated by random high-frequency noise that does not significantly degrade eddy covariance <b>flux</b> measurements. <b>Interference</b> from the <b>flux</b> of other compounds is primarily due to the emission of monoterpenes, propene, ethene and methyl butenol and the deposition of methacrolein and methyl vinyl ketone. The average total interference for North American landscapes in midday summer is estimated to be about 5 % for emissions and - 3 % for deposition fluxes. In only a few North American landscapes, where isoprene emissions are very low and methyl butenol emissions are high, are interferences predicted to be significant. The system was field tested on a tower above a mixed deciduous forest canopy (Duke Forest, North Carolina, USA), dominated by oak trees, which are strong isoprene emitters. Isoprene fluxes were estimated for 307 half-hour sampling periods over 10 days. Daytime fluxes ranging from 1 to 14 mg C m - 2 h - 1 were strongly correlated with light and temperature. The daytime mean flux of 6 mg C m - 2 h - 1 were strongly correlated with light and temperature. The daytime mean flux of 6 mg C m - 2 h - 1 is similar to previous estimates determined by relaxed eddy accumulation by Geron et al. [1997] at this site. Nighttime fluxes were near zero (0. 01 ± 0. 03 mg C m - 2 h - 1) ...|$|R
