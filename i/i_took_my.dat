5|$|And {{being on}} that blessed pilgrimage {{in the sacred}} city of Rome and seeing its great and ancient monuments and reading the great deeds of the Romans as {{described}} by Virgil, Sallust, Lucan, Livy, Valerius, Orosius, and other masters of history... <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> prompting from them although I am a disciple unworthy of such an undertaking. But {{in view of the}} fact that our city of Florence, daughter and offspring of Rome, was mounting and pursuing great purposes, while Rome was in its decline, I thought it proper to trace in this chronicle the origins of the city of Florence, so far as I have been able to recover them, and to relate the city's further development at greater length, and at the same time to give a brief account of events throughout the world as long as it please God, in the hope of whose favor I undertook the said enterprise rather than in reliance on my own poor wits. And thus in the year 1300, on my return from Rome, I began to compile this book in the name of God and the blessed John the Baptist and in honor of our city of Florence.|$|E

A woman who attended one such May Day event later recalled: [...] "When I was called up, <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> six [...] into the Temple, where Mr Garrick was sitting by the fine bust with great cakes before him; he took down all their names, and then gave a shilling {{and a piece of}} plum-cake to every individual one; not even leaving out poor babes in their mothers' arms." ...|$|E
500|$|Ford was {{initiated}} into Freemasonry on September 30, 1949. He later said in 1975, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> obligation {{as a master}} mason—incidentally, with my three younger brothers—I recalled the value my own father attached to that order. But I {{had no idea that}} I would ever be added to the company of the Father of our Country and 12 other members of the order who also served as Presidents of the United States." [...] Ford was made a 33° Scottish Rite Mason on September 26, 1962. In April 1975, Ford was elected by a unanimous vote Honorary Grand Master of the International Supreme Council, Order of DeMolay, a position in which he served until January 1977. Ford received the degrees of York Rite Masonry (Chapter and Council degrees) in a special ceremony in the Oval Office on January 11, 1977, during his term as President of the United States.|$|E
500|$|McCall {{was picked}} for England and Scotland under-21 sides {{on the same}} day in 1984, and chose to join the England under-21 squad for their game against Turkey. However he was only picked as a {{substitute}} and the referee blew the final whistle, with McCall waiting to come on. He later told Scottish newspaper Glasgow Herald, [...] "I felt it was a mistake almost from the start. I was put on the bench and they tried to bring me on with a minute to go. But <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> time re-tying my boots and generally warming up and luckily didn't get on, otherwise that would have been that." [...] Since he had not actually played for England, McCall was still eligible for Scotland. He eventually switched allegiances to the latter, for whom he qualified through his father. He made his Scotland debut at under-21 level in March 1988, ironically against England. McCall made one more appearance for Scotland under 21s, against France in 1990.|$|E

500|$|For {{the final}} scene with Daenerys Targaryen {{emerging}} from the great fire of the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen, the filming took place in two different locations, with the close ups of Emilia Clarke taking place on a closed set in Belfast, and the large-scale set shots taking place in Spain. In an interview, Clarke had previously indicated she had become reluctant to do nude scenes unless it served the plot. After the episode aired, Clarke made a point to indicate {{that it was not}} a body double in {{the final scene}} of the episode, stating, [...] "I'd like to remind people the last time <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> clothes off was season 3. That was awhile ago. It's now season 6. But this is all me, all proud, all strong. I'm just feeling genuinely happy I said 'Yes.' That ain't no body double!"

500|$|AM2 {{developed}} what Sega {{hoped would}} be the Dreamcast's killer app, Shenmue, a [...] "revenge epic {{in the tradition of}} Chinese cinema." [...] The action-adventure title involved the quest of protagonist Ryo Hazuki to avenge his father's murder, but its main selling point was its rendition of the Japanese city of Yokosuka, which included a level of detail considered unprecedented for a video game. Incorporating a simulated day/night cycle with variable weather, non-player characters with regular schedules, and the ability to pick up and examine detailed objects (also introducing the Quick-time event in its modern form), Shenmue went over budget and was rumored to have cost Sega over $50 million. Originally planned as the first installment in an 11-part saga, Shenmue was eventually downsized to a trilogy—and only one sequel was ever released.s development |publisher=Polygon |date=March 19, 2014 |accessdate=December 17, 2014 |quote=Yu Suzuki: The biggest challenge we encountered was project management.

[...] According to Moore, Shenmue sold [...] "extremely well", but the game had no chance of making a profit due to the Dreamcast's limited installed base. Shenmue II [...] "was completed for a much more reasonable sum", while Sato defended Shenmue as an [...] "investment [...] will someday be recouped" [...] because [...] "the development advances we learned... can be applied to other games".

2500|$|When {{black men}} wished to become Masons {{in the new}} nation the white members of the Lodge had to {{unanimously}} vote to accept a petitioner to receive Masonic degrees.

When I have to accept Negroes as brothers or leave Masonry, I shall leave it." [...] Masonic and Grand Lodges generally excluded African Americans. Since the votes were anonymous, {{it was impossible to}} identify the member who had voted against accepting a black member. The effect was the black men who had legitimately been made Masons in integrated jurisdictions could be rejected.
