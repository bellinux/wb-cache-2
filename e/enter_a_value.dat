At that time the representation of most tropical cyclones in the model was fairly poor due to the low model resolution (about 150 km in the horizontal at mid-latitudes) and the sparsity of data over the tropical oceans. Hence, a simple scheme was introduced to help initialise tropical cyclones in the global model.

Ground fault consisting of single phase to ground fault and two phase to ground fault. Ground fault current will changes the settings of ground fault relay (GFR).

Despite continued emphasis and investment, many data collection efforts still suffer from delays, inefficiency and difficulties maintaining quality. Data is often still “stuck ” on paper forms, making it unavailable for decision-makers and operational staff. We apply techniques from computer vision, database systems and machine learning, and leverage new infrastructure – online workers and mobile connectivity – to redesign data entry with high data quality. Shreddr delivers self-serve, low-cost and on-demand data entry service allowing low-resource organizations to quickly transform stacks of paper into structured electronic records through a novel combination of optimizations: batch processing and compression techniques from database systems, automatic document processing using computer vision, and value verification through crowd-sourcing.
