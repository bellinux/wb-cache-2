40|$|Abstract. Diamond {{grinding}} wheel {{is used in}} high precision grinding process, when work piece has a very high hardness. For a specific grinding interval, the wheel must be properly dressed, in order to remove swarf, sharpen the worn diamond grits, open up new diamond protrusions, and recondition the bond material. Dressing of diamond {{grinding wheel}} by alumina <b>dressing</b> <b>tool</b> has been simulated in a pin-on-disk machine in the research. Sharpening of the wheel is indicated by the increase of its roughness value, and surface microstructure with protruding sharp diamond grits. It was found that increasing of sliding distant from 100 to 500 m will increase the roughness of the wheel. The increase of contact load from 10 to 20 N will also increase roughness of the wheel, and the severity of wheel wear, indicated by high values of friction coefficient. A proper dressing of this nickel bonded SD 1200 diamond wheel is by sliding against alumina <b>dressing</b> <b>tool</b> for at least 300 m under 10 N load. Sliding velocity between 0. 1 to 0. 3 m/s has minimal effect to the results. A too large sliding distant and load will cause severe damage to wheel surface, and severe wheel wear, indicated by its large mass loss...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} in three parts {{describing}} {{the analysis and}} simulation of the grinding process. This first part {{is concerned with the}} generation of the wheel surface by single point diamond dressing. In grinding, the grinding wheel has to be dressed periodically to restore wheel form and cutting efficiency. Understanding the process of generating the grinding wheel surface is important for the control of the grinding process. Generation of the wheel surface is simulated as a single diamond dressing process on a computer generated wheel. The wheel is simulated by grains randomly spaced in the wheel volume. The topography of the wheel cutting surface is generated by simulating the action of an ideal <b>dressing</b> <b>tool</b> as it <b>dresses</b> the wheel. The simulation of the wheel topography takes account of the motion of the <b>dressing</b> <b>tool,</b> grain size, grain spacing, grain fracture and grain break-out. The simulated cutting surface is used for further simulations of grinding. The simulation of grinding using the simulated grinding wheel surface is described in Sections 2 and 3 where a comparison is made of results predicted from simulation with results obtained from experiments. By matching simulated and experimental results, it is possible to explain the relative importance of dressing and grinding parameters...|$|R

40|$|In {{manufacture}} of structural ceramic components, grinding costs can comprise up to 80 % {{of the entire}} manufacturing cost. Most of these costs arise from the conventional multi-step grinding process with numerous grinding wheels and additional capital equipment, perishable <b>dressing</b> <b>tools,</b> and labor. In an attempt to reduce structural ceramic grinding costs, a feasibility investigation was undertaken to develop a single step, roughing-finishing process suitable for producing high-quality silicon nitride ceramic parts at high material removal rates at lower cost than traditional, multi-stage grinding. This feasibility study employed combined use of laboratory grinding tests, mathematical grinding models, and characterization of resultant material surface condition. More specifically, this Phase 1 final report provides a technical overview of High-Speed, Low-Damage (HSLD) ceramic grinding and the conditions necessary to achieve the small grain depths of cut necessary for low damage grinding while operating at relatively high material removal rates. Particular issues addressed include determining effects of wheel speed and material removal rate on resulting mode of material removal (ductile or brittle fracture), limiting grinding forces, calculation of approximate grinding zone temperatures developed during HSLD grinding, and developing the experimental systems necessary for determining HSLD grinding energy partition relationships. In addition, practical considerations for production utilization of the HSLD process are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGrinding causes {{progressive}} dulling and glazing of {{the grinding}} wheel grains and clogging of the voids on the wheel's surface with ground metal dust particles, which gradually increases the grinding forces. The {{condition of the}} grains at the periphery of a grinding wheel strongly influences the damage induced in a ground workpiece. Therefore, truing and dressing {{must be carried out}} frequently. Dressing is the process of conditioning the grinding wheel surface to reshape the wheel when it has lost its original shape through wear, giving the tool its original condition of efficiency. Despite the very broad range of <b>dressing</b> <b>tools</b> available today, the single-point diamond dresser is still the most widely used dressing tool due to its great versatility. The aim of this work is to predict the wear level of the single-point dresser based on acoustic emission and vibration signals used as input variables for fuzzy models. Experimental tests were performed with synthetic diamond dressers on a surface-grinding machine equipped with an aluminum oxide grinding wheel. Acoustic emission and vibration sensors were attached to the tool holder and the signals were captured at 2 MHz. During the tests, the wear of the diamond tip was measured every 20 passes using a microscope with 10 to 100 X magnification. A study was conducted of the frequency content of the signals, choosing the frequency bands that best correlate with the diamond's wear. Digital band-pass filters were applied to the raw signals, after which two statistics were calculated to serve as the inputs for the fuzzy models. The results indicate that the fuzzy models using the aforementioned signal statistics are highly effective for predicting the wear level of the dresser...|$|E

Dressing skills involve physical development, gross and fine motor skills, as well as language/literacy and cognitive skills. Relevant research articles were reviewed which pertain to children achieving self help skills, such as dressing. The various studies demonstrated that specific training, specialized clothing, and intervention methods were helpful in teaching young children the skills of dressing. There is currently a finite amount of resources to assist children with learning independent dressing skills. This project seeks to uncover specific issues children face with dressing; and tries to determine if the originally designed instructional clothing garments will assist young children in acquiring dressing skills. To determine the efficiency and potential uses of instructional garments, Child Development specialists such as teachers, occupational therapists, and behavior interventionists, were given a survey to evaluate the garments. The survey focused on questions pertaining to specific issues young children face with learning to dress themselves, as well as how helpful these instructional clothing garments would be as <b>dressing</b> <b>tools</b> in a classroom, therapeutic setting, or in the confines of one???s own bedroom. Out of the two occupational therapists, one behavioral interventionist, and six teachers, nearly all participants agreed that children experience difficulty with dressing.

40|$|Current {{techniques}} for {{the manufacture of}} functional micro scale surface structures are both time consuming and expensive. Techniques for Ultra-Precision (UP) abrasive machining of functional surfaces, using specially manufactured tools, have previously been described for example in the grinding of riblets. However these methods are both costly and limited in their functionality. Using conventional UP grinding tools and a novel dressing technique, adapted from macro scale grinding, provides an alternative solution offering both low cost and ease of adaptability. Such a system {{would be capable of}} producing regular deterministic surface textures over a large area to a depth of 10 - 20 μm grinding in single or multiple passes. To achieve this, the grinding wheel surface is shaped with specialised geometries using a single point diamond <b>dressing</b> <b>tool.</b> The required geometry for a given surface texture can be modelled and used to design a dressing solution consisting of a dressing depth and feedrate. Adapting a conventional grinding machine (Precitech Nanoform 250 Ultra-Grind) for such a process presents many technical challenges to overcome. The quality of the finished surface will be dependent on the accuracy of the dressing process and the tool/workpiece interaction. Methods for controlling and measuring the dressing depth, feedrate, spindle speed and runout have been designed and trialled to determine the feasibility of the process. The results of the trials have been compared against the model to determine the deviation from ideal and hence the quality of the finished surface...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The tribal women, {{constitute}} {{like any}} other social group, {{about half of the}} total population. The tribal women, as women in all social groups, are more illiterate than men. Like others social groups, the tribal women share problems related to reproductive health. When primary and secondary subsistence activities are counted, women work more than men. Status of women varies in different societies. The conceptual framework to analyse women’s status comprise the seven roles women play in life and work:- parental, conjugal, domestic, kin, occupational, community and as an individual. In order to appraise the social status of women in these diverse ecological areas, the findings have been divided in to subsequent categories:- (a) a girl; daughter; a unmarried woman; (b) a married woman; (c) a widow; (d) divorcee; and (e) a barren woman. Role of women is not only of importance in economic activities, but her role in non-economic activities is equally important. The tribal women work very hard, in some cases even more than the men. All the tribal societies in the study area are patriarchal in which men dominate in public sector. However, in their own world women have a freedom, and a self-expression. With the onset of development programmes economic changes are taking place but tribal women remain traditional in their <b>dress,</b> language, <b>tools</b> and resources, because they grow food crops rather than cash crops.

40|$|Abstract. Grinding is a {{final step}} in the {{production}} chain of gears and therefore determines {{the quality of the}} product. In the industrial practice gears are cut- generally by means of a hobbing process- and their surface is hardened through a heat treatment, which has the target of increasing the wear resistance of the tooth flanks. Grinding is therefore necessary to remove the material distortions originating during the heat treatment and to fulfill dimensional and quality requirements. Usually only gears with high quality requirements are ground. Otherwise grinding is not carried out to reduce the production costs. In the recent years however the percentage of ground gears has been growing continuously due to the rising demands on load capacity, quiet running and life time as well as the increasing performance offered by the grinding processes. Generating grinding by means of cylindrical grinding worms shows the highest potential among the existing processes for gear grinding due to the high material removal performance that can be achieved. In order to use dressable worms efficiently the dressing technology has to be optimized. The present contribution describes the technology for dressing vitreous bonded grinding worms. This process is based on the use of form dressing rollers by means of which the grinding worm geometry and topography are generated. The investigations are aimed at analyzing the influence of the dressing parameters, in particular the speed ratio between <b>dressing</b> and grinding <b>tool,</b> and the attainable gear quality and surface properties. The results show significant dependencies between the dressing strategy and the grinding results...|$|R

Since the elderly population is on the rise, {{there is a need to}} highlight this growing problem, to make sure that proper assessment tools are used and to improve the standard of care given to patients with leg ulcers. The aim was to show what a difference the nurse can make to patients with leg ulcers. With all types of wounds it is imperative to establish if there is any underlying reasons since certain illnesses can cause more wounds or delay the healing process. The doctor is responsible for making the diagnosis and to prescribe the correct treatment whereas the nurse’s responsibility is for the nursing care and its documentation.

A holistic approach is therefore necessary to be able to give good standard of nursing care. The nurse can by being careful and precise when changing the <b>dressing,</b> using assessment <b>tools</b> and document, give encouragment for compliance, inform and educate patients, help a great deal in the patient’s healing process. Further research is needed to see how the nurses’ compliance can be improved, and how new knowledge can be implemented.

40|$|From burkini {{swimwear}} {{in public}} beaches to sport-scarves in competitive sport, female Islamic veiling in sport raises issues of equality, cultural sensitivity and multicultural accommodation. While {{other kinds of}} ‘headscarf’ disputes have been widely analysed by social scientists, those to do with sport and common space remain under-researched. Drawing upon ethnographic fieldwork in Helsinki, I discuss two Finnish cases about veiling, sport, female agency and spatial conflict. Using Lefebvre’s ideas about hegemonic spaces and resistance, I argue that while veiling Muslim women participating in sport in common space disrupt dominant ideas about how common space is to be used, veiling also provides these women with tools to challenge both majority and minority group understandings of appropriate behaviour and ‘normality’. The first case concerns disputes over women-only swimming hours in public swimming halls. Gender-specific swimming hours are allocated {{for the benefit of}} Muslim women who, due to their religious convictions, cannot swim in mixed-gender spaces. These have triggered public debates about how publicly-funded places for exercise are to be used, and whether gender-segregated practices involve discrimination against men. Such debates reveal two viewpoints: while the State considers positive discrimination as an obligation, its critics argue that all discrimination creates inequality, ignoring the existing inequalities that positive discrimination targets. The second case reveals how Muslim women use various sports, like jogging, cycling and swimming, as tools to claim both spatial liberty vis-a-vis their ethno-religious community, and the status of ‘normality’ in respect to mainstream Finnish society. In such strategies, being ‘appropriately’ <b>dressed</b> is the <b>tool</b> which guarantees their respectability, despite the suspicions that may be expressed against their sporting activities per se. Veiling appears as a complex of cultural expectations and challenges to them. Encompassing the State, ethnic groups and individuals, negotiations of sport reveal deep-rooted assumptions about public and common spaces...|$|R
