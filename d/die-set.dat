To prevent damage to the plug (and the expensive crimp <b>die-set),</b> the crimp tool must be carefully matched to the plug being attached. For example, termination of a cable with an 8P8C plug involves using a hand crimper or crimp machine containing an 8P8C <b>die-set</b> or an A67T standard <b>die-set.</b> An 8P8C crimp <b>die-set</b> usually looks similar to an 8P8C jack, except for the eight teeth lining the top portion of the die. When the tool is operated, the die compresses around the 8P8C plug. As the die compresses, these teeth force the plug contacts down into the conductors of the cable being terminated, permanently attaching the plug to the cable.|$|E

40|$|Equal channel angular {{pressing}} {{is one of}} {{the techniques}} in metal forming processes in which an ultra-large plastic strain is imposed on a bulk material in order to make ultra-fine grained and nanocrystalline metals and alloys. The technique is a viable forming procedure to extrude materials by use of specially designed channel dies without substantially changing the geometry by imposing severe plastic deformation. This technique has the potential for high strain rate superplasticity by effective grain refinement {{to the level of the}} submicron-scale or nanoscale. Wereview recent work on new trends in equal channel angular pressing techniques and the manufacturing of <b>die-sets</b> used for the processing of metals and alloys.

After deformation, all samples were subjected to a hardness test and the results showed improved mechanical behaviour of the ultra-fine grained copper alloy that was developed. This research provides an opportunity to examine the significance of the equal channel angular pressing process for metals and alloys.

40|$|Forging {{provides}} an elegant {{solution to the}} problem of producing complicated shapes from heated metal. This study attempts to relate some of the important parameters involved when considering, simple upsetting, closed die forging and extrusion forging. A literature survey showed some of the empirical graphical and statistical methods of load prediction together with analytical methods of estimating load and energy. Investigations of the effects of high strain rate and temperature on the stress-strain properties of materials are also evident. In the present study special equipment including an experimental drop hammer and various <b>die-sets</b> have been designed and manufactured. Instrumentation to measure load/time and displacement/time behaviour, of the deformed metal, has been incorporated and calibrated. A high speed camera was used to record the behaviour mode of test pieces used in the simple upsetting tests. Dynamic and quasi-static material properties for the test materials, lead and aluminium alloy, were measured using the drop hammer and a compression-test machine. Analytically two separate mathematical solutions have been developed: A numerical technique using a lumped-mass model for the analysis of simple upsetting and closed-die forging and, for extrusion forging, an analysis which equates the shear and compression energy requirements to the work done by the forging load. Cylindrical test pieces were used for all the experiments and both dry and lubricated test conditions were investigated. The static and dynamic tests provide data on Load, Energy and the Profile of the deformed billet. In addition for the Extrusion Forging, both single ended and double ended tests were conducted. Material dependency was also examined by a further series of tests on aluminium and copper. Comparison of the experimental and theoretical results was made which shows clearly the effects of friction and high strain rate on load and energy requirements and the deformation mode of the billet.

40|$|Demands {{of various}} {{miniature}} mechanical parts and {{products such as}} for watches, cameras, medical devices, miniature <b>die-sets,</b> and so on, are increasing more and more. Contrarily, manufacturing systems for those parts and products are becoming larger and more complicated. The research group including the authors developed the first prototype of a microfactory which consisted of miniature machine tools and manipulators, in 2000, as a countermeasure for the situation. We insisted that {{the advantage of the}} microfactory would be its capability to reduce environmental impact and costs of manufacturing, especially for diverse-types-and-small-quantity production. Since the smallness of the each machine enables factory layout change, the microfactory can control the increase of the costs when the designs of products have been modified. By replacing conventional manufacturing systems by microfactories, electrical power and initial cost of the machines can be also reduced. On the other hand, machines of the microfactory should be designed small and simple, to ensure the abovementioned advantages. It means that those machines cannot have extra power, throughput, process capability, and so on. So, in the microfactory, many design issues such as machine design, system design and process design should be solved concurrently. And for the purpose, quantitative evaluation method for machines, systems and processes of the microfactories are required first. However, the effect of the microfactory in reducing environmental impact and costs has not been examined quantitatively. If it is possible to show how microfactory can contribute to enhance the efficiency of the production systems, application area of the microfactory will greatly expand. So, as the first step of the quantitative evaluation of system design, this paper proposes a simple efficiency index based on the overall throughput, machine cost, labor cost, electricity cost, environmental impact measured by electrical power and material consumption. The proposed efficiency index is expressed by the equation, Ef=F/SQRT(C*E), where Ef is the efficiency index, F is the functionality of the system, C is the overall cost and E is the overall environmental impact. In the paper F is simply expressed by the throughput of the system. C is the sum of the labor cost, the machine cost and the electricity cost, and E is sum of equivalent CO 2 exhaust of power consumption and materials for the machines. Using the abovementioned microfactory as an example, the paper tries to examine whether the proposed index is useful in evaluating and improving the system configuration. The calculation results indicate that there are some configurations that are more efficient than the others. The calculation also shows that efficiencies of miniature systems like the microfactory are not very less than those of conventional mass production systems, when the required throughput is not very high. The result leads us to conclude that the proposed efficiency index is useful in evaluating the system design. It also insists that microfactory-like systems are hopeful for future manufacturing systems in which high functionality, low cost and low environmental impact are required. Pages: 47 - 5...|$|R

In this work we present models {{that can be used to}} predict the energy requirements, global warming potential, human health impacts, and costs of making drawn parts using zinc (kirksite) die-sets and hydraulic or mechanical presses. The methodology presented can also be used to produce models of stamping using other die materials, such as iron, for which casting data already exists. An unprecedented study on the environmental impacts and costs of zinc <b>die-set</b> production was conducted at a leading Michigan die-maker. This analysis was used in conjunction with electrical energy measurements on forming presses to complete cradle-to-gate impact and cost analyses on producing small batch size hood and tailgate parts. These case studies were used to inform a generalized model that allows engineers to predict the impacts and costs of forming based on as little information as the final part material, surface area, thickness and batch size (number of units produced). The case studies show that press electricity is an insignificant contributor to the overall impacts and costs. The generalized models highlight that while costs for small batch production are dominated by the <b>die-set,</b> the environmental impacts are often dominated by the sheet metal. These findings explain the motivation behind research into die-less forming processes such as incremental sheet forming, and emphasize the need to minimize sheet metal scrap generation in order to reduce environmental impacts.

40|$|The {{motivation}} {{behind this}} study is the lack of specialized analysis regarding internal failure caused by the adiabatic shear hand (ASB) phenomenon in the cold-headed products. Its aim was to present an integrated workability study to improve and assist cold-heading (CH) multistage design procedures to replace the current design rules of thumb, as they are neither effective nor adequate in fulfilling the needs of the new developments in the rapidly expanding CH industry. To achieve these goals, a comprehensive testing methodology and FE modeling, implemented within ABAQUS/Explicit, were established. This methodology includes an instrumented Drop Weight Compression Test (DWCT) tower equipped with a guided pocket <b>die-set</b> configuration capable of developing internal failure at different stages of ASBs and integrated metallographic inspection techniques. A validated FE model of the DWCT and guided pocket <b>die-set</b> configuration was a valuable tool in establishing the failure criteria and indicating the workability limits. A detailed experimental and FE study for the ASB stages in the CH process was introduced to uncover the affect of different parameters controlling the failure mechanisms within the ASBs in the CH process. This study investigated the effect of the thermal, geometric and the material flow softening and hardening mechanisms affecting ASB evolution. Moreover, a detailed metallurgical and FE study of the internal ductile and Transformed Adiabatic Shear Band (TASB) failures caused by the ASB phenomenon in DWCT was conducted. Three ductile failure criteria were introduced to predict the initiation and location of the internal ductile failure in the ASBs. One TASB failure criteria was introduced to predict the phase transformation to undesirable brittle martensite. These failure criteria were employed to establish integrated workability methodologies to indicate the objective workability limits. Applying these workability methodologies on multistage CH FE models showed that these methodologies are an efficient tool to predict the damage levels and failure initiation locations within the cold-headed bolts. Moreover, these methodologies were successful in optimizing the die designs in order to reduce damage levels...|$|E

The effects, of the constituent elements of GFR laminate, upon the punching characteristics of the board were studied {{by means of a}} specially designed press dynamometer located within a standard press-tool die set used on a mechanical crank press. Both hot and cold punching techniques were developed initially by the use of commercially supplied samples of both paper and GFR laminates. Laboratory manufactured polyester laminates were produced with different resins, filler sizes and forms of glass fibre re-inforcement. These experimental boards were punched and analysed in respect to specific punching criteria and laminate punched quality. The punch quality (PQ) was assessed by a quanti tative technique using a magnified image of the punched contour and a graticule; the punch contour used was of a special design to incorporate the PQ requirements and provide the extreme crack propagation geometry. The surface density of the glass fibre re-inforcement was found to' be a primary factor influencing the main punch load and shear energy criteria used. The ladder stripping load required to remove the ladder from the punch was also investigated by means of a strain-gauged stripper-pad, and showed an important sensitivity to punching temperature, which could be utilized in industry when ladder stripping is a problem. Additional to the main programme of work already outlined above, a series of test punchings were also made at different punch velocities on three other sets of equipment, one of which was an Instron testing machine using a punch and die accessory conforming to BS. 2782 requirements for shear testing of plastic sheet etc. From this basic Instron shear load information a simple mathematical model was developed to quantify the relative shear energy functions of the different punching equipments used; for the crank press <b>die-set</b> the specific shear energy (SSE) absorbed was found to be considerably higher than {{for the remainder of the}} test rigs used, thus some consideration was given to this result.
