40|$|This work {{isolates}} {{the physics}} of aerodynamics and structural dynamics from the helicopter rotor aeromechanics problem, investigates them separately, identifies the prediction deficiencies in each, improves upon them, and couples them back together. The objective {{is to develop a}} comprehensive analysis capability for accurate and consistent prediction of rotor vibratory loads in steady level flight. The rotor vibratory loads are the dominant source of helicopter vibration. There are two critical vibration regimes for helicopters in steady level flight: (1) low speed transition and (2) high speed forward flight. The mechanism of rotor vibration at low speed transition is well understood - inter-twinning of blade tip vortices below the rotor disk. The mechanism of rotor vibration at high speed is not clear. The focus in this research is on high speed flight. The goal is to understand the key mechanisms involved and accurately model them. Measured lift, chord force, pitching moment and damper force from the UH- 60 A Flight Test Program are used to predict, validate and refine the rotor structural dynamics. The prediction errors originate entirely from structural modeling. Once validated, the resultant blade deformations are used to predict and validate aerodynamics. Air loads are calculated using a table look up based unsteady lifting-line model and compared with predictions from a 3 -dimensional unsteady CFD model. Both Navier-Stokes and Euler predictions are studied. By separating aerodynamics from structural dynamics, it is established that the advancing blade lift phase problem and the problem of vibratory air loads at high speed stem from inaccurate aerodynamic modeling, not structural dynamic modeling. Vibratory lift at high speed is caused by large <b>elastic</b> <b>torsion</b> deformations (- 8 to - 10 degrees near the tip) driven by pitching moments and wake interactions on the advancing blade. The dominant phenomenon at the outboard stations (86. 5 % R to 99 % R) is the <b>elastic</b> <b>torsion.</b> Vibratory lift at these stations are dominantly 3 /rev and arise from 2 /rev <b>elastic</b> <b>torsion.</b> At the inboard stations (67. 5 % R and 77. 5 % R), the vibratory lift is impulsive in nature and is not captured by <b>elastic</b> <b>torsion</b> alone. An accurate rotor wake model is necessary in addition to accurate <b>elastic</b> <b>torsion.</b> Accurate <b>elastic</b> <b>torsion</b> requires accurate pitching moments. Lifting-line models, with airfoil tables, unsteady aerodynamics, near wake and far wake do not capture the unsteady transonic pitching moments at the outboard stations (86. 5 % R to 99 % R). A 3 -dimensional CFD analyses, both Navier-Stokes and Euler, significantly improve pitching moment predictions at the outboard stations. The 3 D Navier-Stokes CFD analysis is then consistently coupled with a rotor comprehensive analysis to improve prediction of rotor vibratory loads at high speed. The CFD-comprehensive code coupling is achieved using a loose coupling methodology. The CFD analysis significantly improves section pitching moment prediction near the blade tip. because it captures the steady and unsteady 3 D transonic effects. Accurate pitching moments drive elastic twist deformations which together with a refined rotor wake model generate the right vibratory airload harmonics at all radial stations. The flap bending moments, torsion bending moments and pitch link load predictions are significantly improved by CFD coupling...|$|E

The impact of blade dynamics on blade section lift-coefficient time histories is studied by comparing predictions from both a rigid blade analysis and an elastic blade analysis with helicopter flight test data. The elastic blade analysis better predicts high-frequency behavior of section lift.

Elastic blade motion affects the blade angle of attack by a few tenths of a degree, and up to the sixth rotor harmonic. A similar study of the influence of blade dynamics on bending and torsion moments was also conducted. The modal analysis of the predicted blade structural loads suggested that five elastic bending deg of freedom (four flap and one lag) and three <b>elastic</b> <b>torsion</b> deg of freedom contributed to calculations of the blade structural loads.

The objective of the improved design is to reduce vibratory loads at the rotor hub that are the main source of helicopter vibration. Constraints are imposed on aeroelastic stability, and move limits are imposed on the blade elastic stiffness design variables.

The critical bending Moment M_K_i takes into account the boundary conditions of the beam and the type of loading. The determination of M_K_i is based on a model where the structural steel section is laterally braced at the top flange and where the influence of the concrete slab and the distorsional effects of the web is taken into account by an elastic restraint against rotation. The influence of the bending moment distribution is allowed for by a factor which was determined for a steel section, laterally braced at the top flange but neglecting the influence <b>elastic</b> restraint against <b>torsion.</b> The influence of the <b>torsion</b> <b>elastic</b> restraint of the concrete slab and the distorsional deformations of the web are taken into account by an effective St. Venant torsion stiffness based on a one wave buckling shape.

The torque-rotation relationship is computed based on the finite-displacement (finite-rotation) theory, that is the transverse displacement components are expressed so as to be valid for large rotations and the longitudinal normal strain includes the second-order geometric non-linear term often described as the ""Wagner strain"". The proposed formulation does not stand on the assumption of a thin-walled structure and therefore the cross-section's torsional rigidity is evaluated exactly without using the so-called Saint-Venant's torsional constant. The torsional rigidity of the cross-section is evaluated directly employing the primary warping function of the cross-section depending on its shape. Three boundary-value problems with respect to the variable along the beam axis angle of twist, to the primary and to the secondary warping functions are formulated. The first one, employing the Analog Equation Method (a BEM-based method), yields a system of non-linear equations from which the angle of twist is computed by an iterative process. The remaining two problems are solved employing a pure BE method. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the method and demonstrate its efficiency and accuracy. The developed procedure retains most of the advantages of a BEM solution over a pure domain discretization method, although it requires domain discretization. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The gradient of the stress functions for plastic torsion has a constant magnitude, and hence a function of this type assumes the profile of a sand hill.

The distinctive features of the sensor are that the differential electrostatic system provides simultaneous reading of the desired signal and a control the torsional rigidity of suspension.

The presence of аlternating current (AC) voltage sources allows to get the parametric amplification of AC and significantly to improve {{the sensitivity of the}} sensor. In the simplest case, the sensor does not contain any feedback circuits. As an example, calculations of the micromechanical linear accelerations confirm that the periodic modulation of the coefficient of elastic stiffness of the suspension can significantly increase the sensitivity in the low frequency range, {{even in the absence of}} parametric resonance. Conditions for suppressions of background current participating in the output signal from a parametric pumping due to the asymmetry of the differential circuits are set. The frequency characteristics calculations of the sensor were carried out. It is expected, that the proposed sensor design ensures minimum noise level, which can be achievable in the graviinertial sensors. This design and the constructed theory can serve as a basis for creating a wide range of graviinertial devices operating on a movable base, for example, linear and angular accelerometer, gravity gradiometer, gravimeters, and inclinometers, which can be realized in the hybrid and in the micromechanical versions. </p...|$|E

We then discretize the rod and compute energies per element by employing finite element methods. Thus, the global dynamic behavior is independent of the discretization. The dynamic evolution of the rod is obtained by numerical integration of the resulting Lagrange equations of motion. We further show how this system of equations can be decoupled and efficiently solved. Since the centerline of the rod is explicitly represented, the deformation model allows for accurate contact and self-contact handling. Thus, we can reproduce many important looping phenomena. Further, a broad variety of different materials can be simulated at interactive rates. Experiments underline the physical plausibility of our deformation model...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the <b>elastic</b> {{nonuniform}} <b>torsion</b> analysis of composite cylindrical bars of arbitrary cross section consisting of materials in contact, {{each of which}} can surround {{a finite number of}} inclusions, taking into account the effect of geometric nonlinearity is presented employing the boundary element method (BEM). All of the cross section's materials are perfectly bonded together, that is separation is not allowed. The torque-rotation relationship is computed based on the finite displacement (finite rotation) theory, that is the transverse displacement components are expressed so as to be valid for large rotations and the longitudinal normal strain includes the second-order geometric nonlinear term often described as the ""Wagner strain. "" The proposed formulation does not stand on the assumption of a thin-walled structure and therefore the cross section's torsional rigidity is evaluated exactly without using the so-called Saint-Venant's torsional constant. The torsional rigidity of the cross section is evaluated directly employing the primary warping function of the cross section depending on its shape. Three boundary value problems with respect to the variable along the beam axis angle of twist, to the primary and to the secondary warping functions are formulated. The first one, employing the Analog Equation Method (a BEM based method), yields a system of nonlinear equations from which the angle of twist is computed by an iterative process. The rest two problems are solved employing a pure BE method. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the method and demonstrate its efficiency and accuracy. The developed procedure retains most of the advantages of a BEM solution over a pure domain discretization method, although it requires domain discretization. © 2009 ASCE...|$|R
