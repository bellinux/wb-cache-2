5|$|In the 21st century {{there have}} been three large {{fundraising}} campaigns at the Gallery: in 2004, to buy Raphael’s Madonna of the Pinks, in 2008, for Titian's <b>Diana</b> <b>and</b> Actaeon, and in 2012, Titian's <b>Diana</b> <b>and</b> Callisto. Both Titians were bought in tandem with the National Gallery of Scotland for £95m. Both of these major works were sold from the famous collection of the Duke of Sutherland. The National Gallery is now largely priced out of the market for Old Master paintings and can only make such acquisitions with the backing of major public appeals; the departing director Charles Saumarez Smith expressed his frustration at this situation in 2007.|$|E

The guns recovered were probably used in the American positions during the Battle of Bunker Hill.|$|E

5|$|At 22:00 on 12 November Amazone and Elisa sailed from Le Havre {{to unite}} {{with the force}} at Cherbourg, hoping to evade the {{blockade}} in the darkness. They successfully passed the patrolling <b>Diana</b> <b>and</b> Niobe but were spotted sailing northwest at 00:30 by the British ships which gave chase, Niobe turning inshore {{in an attempt to}} cut off the French line of advance. With the wind in the northeast, the French frigates were unable to pass Cape Barfleur under pursuit, and Rosseau instead turned his squadron towards the Iles Saint-Marcouf at 04:00, using superior local knowledge to bypass the pursuing British ships. The heavily fortified islands had been under British control during the French Revolutionary Wars, but reverted to the French at the Peace of Amiens in 1802. <b>Diana</b> <b>and</b> Niobe attempted to intercept the French frigates before they came under the shelter of the guns, but were only able to fire two long-distance broadsides at the trailing Elisa.|$|E
5|$|Apparently Constantine did not patronize Christianity alone. After gaining {{victory in}} the Battle of the Milvian Bridge (312), a triumphal arch—the Arch of Constantine—was built (315) to {{celebrate}} his triumph. The arch is decorated with images of the goddess Victoria. At {{the time of its}} dedication, sacrifices to gods like Apollo, <b>Diana,</b> <b>and</b> Hercules were made. Absent from the Arch are any depictions of Christian symbolism. However, as the Arch was commissioned by the Senate, the absence of Christian symbols may reflect the role of the Curia at the time as a pagan redoubt.|$|E
5|$|Dreamtime {{opens with}} the premise {{that many of those}} accused of {{witchcraft}} in early modern Christendom had been undergoing visionary journeys {{with the aid of a}} hallucinogenic salve which was suppressed by the Christian authorities. Duerr argues that this salve had been a part of the nocturnal visionary traditions associated with the goddess <b>Diana,</b> <b>and</b> he attempts to trace their origins back to the ancient world, before looking at goddesses associated with the wilderness and arguing that in various goddess-centred cultures, the cave represented a symbolic vagina and was used for birth rituals.|$|E

5|$|Girlfight {{was filmed}} over 24 days in New York and New Jersey. For scenes inside the gym where <b>Diana</b> <b>and</b> Tiny train, the filmmakers {{shot in a}} {{warehouse}} in Jersey City.

Cinematographer Patrick Cady used camera rigs that allowed the actors to hit him or the camera itself to mimic {{the feeling of being}} hit.|$|E
5|$|In 1936 Dunglass married Elizabeth Alington; her father, Cyril Alington, {{had been}} Dunglass's {{headmaster}} at Eton, and was from 1933 Dean of Durham. The service was at Durham Cathedral, conducted by Alington together with William Temple, Archbishop of York and Hensley Henson, Bishop of Durham. In {{addition to the}} large number of aristocratic guests, the household and estate staffs of the Douglas-Home properties at Douglas Castle and the Hirsel were invited. There were four children of the marriage: Caroline, Meriel, <b>Diana</b> <b>and</b> David. The last was Dunglass's heir, inheriting the earldom of Home in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Liz first {{appears in}} the episode airing on October 3, 2001, {{as the owner of}} the unnamed resort on the fictional island of St. Lisa's, located near Bermuda and the Bermuda Triangle. She helps her former boyfriend Brian O'Leary rescue Sheridan Crane {{following}} the explosion of her boat. Along with Brian, and their friend Doc, Liz becomes close with the amnesiac Sheridan while trying to help her to remember her past. Sheridan believes her name is Diana due to confusing memories of her friendship with Diana, Princess of Wales with her own; she begins a romantic relationship with Brian. Liz grows increasingly jealous of the attention Brian pays to <b>Diana</b> <b>and</b> suspicious of Brian's true identity. Liz forms a close friendship with Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald after he comes to the island to pick up a boat for his then girlfriend Beth Wallace. She thinks Luis is Diana's fiancée, but fails to reunite them, despite several attempts, before he returns home. Liz joins <b>Diana</b> <b>and</b> Brian to sail the ship back to the fictional town of Harmony. Upon returning to Harmony on Christmas Eve, Brian reveals his identity as Antonio Lopez-Fitzgerald, the long lost brother of Luis, and Liz and Diana convince him to reunite with his family. Liz again attempts to reunite Diana with Luis, but fails to do so before they return to St. Lisa's Island.|$|E

5|$|The Antonine Wall and its {{associated}} forts left a direct sculptural legacy in Scotland. There are 19 distance slabs along the wall that depict graphically the victories and marches of the legions involved in its construction. There are also surviving sculptures, including an altar to <b>Diana</b> <b>and</b> Apollo. There is a fountainhead from a bath-house {{in the shape of}} a man's head with a gaping mouth, and the head from a bust or statue, perhaps the goddess Fortuna, both found at Bearsden Roman Fort, East Dunbartonshire, both showing a local Celtic influence in their style.|$|E
5|$|The season {{produced}} 16tropical depressions, {{of which}} 14 intensified into tropical storms, 8became hurricanes, and 1became a major hurricane. Although the season {{had the highest}} number of named storms at the time, it featured only two notable storms, primarily because many of the tropical cyclones remained either weak or at sea. The two most significant storms of the season, in terms of damage and loss of life, were Hurricane <b>Diana</b> <b>and</b> Tropical Storm Marco. However, the strongest tropical cyclone of the season was Hurricane Gustav.|$|E

5|$|Tomlinson then {{attempted}} to assist Mohamed al-Fayed in his privately funded {{investigation into the}} death of Diana, Princess of Wales and al-Fayed's son Dodi.

5|$|After the 1841 general election, Melbourne was {{replaced}} as Prime Minister by Sir Robert Peel, who appointed Albert {{as chairman of}} the Royal Commission in charge of redecorating the new Palace of Westminster. The Palace had burned down seven years before, and was being rebuilt. As a patron and purchaser of pictures and sculpture, the commission was set up to promote the fine arts in Britain. The commission's work was slow, and the architect, Charles Barry, took many decisions out of the commissioners' hands by decorating rooms with ornate furnishings that were treated as part of the architecture. Albert was more successful as a private patron and collector. Among his notable purchases were early German and Italian paintings—such as Lucas Cranach the Elder's Apollo and <b>Diana</b> <b>and</b> Fra Angelico's St Peter Martyr—and contemporary pieces from Franz Xaver Winterhalter and Edwin Landseer. , of Dresden, assisted Albert in buying pictures of the highest quality.|$|E
5|$|Ciocia {{writes that}} {{with half the}} novel taking place in {{theatrical}} settings, Nan may be playing a role as character in her own life or a play on a stage set in a theatre or the streets of London. She starts as a spectator watching Kitty onstage, and later with Kitty, watching how men move and behave to improve their act. She becomes a performer, with Kitty, as a renter and again for the predatory <b>Diana</b> <b>and</b> her friends. Finally she takes the role of director as she assists and impels Ralph to perform his speech. At this point, {{she is able to}} reconcile her identity and the story ends. Waters consciously chose to create a complicated plot, and was impressed with Iris Murdoch's claim that she herself had entire stories worked out well in advance of writing them, a method Waters used with Tipping the Velvet.|$|E

5|$|Diana later goes to Hector's {{birthday}} party, but leaves {{when she}} sees Adrian getting friendly with his ex-girlfriend. When <b>Diana</b> <b>and</b> Adrian spar at their next session in the gym, he is reluctant to hit her, and she leaves before he can talk to her.
