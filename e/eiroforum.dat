50|$|Organised by <b>EIROforum,</b> a {{collaboration}} of European research organisations, the initiative Science on Stage began in 1999 as Physics on Stage (POS), with {{financial support from}} the European Commission was half funded by <b>EIROforum.</b> <b>EIROforum</b> launched the initiative to address the decreasing numbers of young physicists. The first Physics on Stage festival was at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, in 2000. Over {{the course of an}} inspiring week, more than 500 teachers from 22 countries shared activities and projects in a fair, in workshops, in performances and in presentations showed that physics can be fun. On the back of this success, Physics on Stage 2 was arranged in 2002 at ESA in Noordwijk, the Netherlands. Physics on Stage 3 followed a year later at the same location.|$|E
50|$|<b>EIROforum</b> is an {{organization}} consisting of eight European intergovernmental scientific research organisations devoted to fostering mutual activities. Presided upon by the Director Generals of the individual organizations, who meet twice a year, the organization aims to identify mutual activities amongst its members to share resources in various fields.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>EIROforum</b> plays {{a crucial}} role to {{establish}} a European Research Area. It works closely both with the European Union and national institutions and actively participates in shaping science policy in Europe. The member organisations engage in cutting-edge research activities and pool their substantial expertise in basic research resources by interacting to find common synergies.|$|E
5000|$|The {{member states}} of the European Union do have many common {{policies}} within the European Union (EU) and {{on behalf of the}} EU that are sometimes suggestive of a single state. It has a common executive (the European Commission), a single High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, a common European Security and Defence Policy, a supreme court (European Court of Justicebut only in matters of European Union law) and an intergovernmental research organisation (the <b>EIROforum</b> with members like CERN). The euro {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "single European currency", which has been officially adopted by nineteen EU countries while seven other member countries of the European Union have linked their currencies to the euro in ERM II. In addition a number of European territories outside the EU have adopted the euro unofficially such as Montenegro, the Republic of Kosovo and Andorra.|$|E
5000|$|The {{members of}} <b>EIROforum</b> soon {{realised}} {{that the lack}} of young scientists was not limited to the field of physics, so the initiative was broadened to cover all sciences and renamed Science on Stage. The first Science on Stage festival [...] took place in 2005, again at CERN in Geneva, and the second in 2007 at ESRF/ILL in Grenoble, France. The format of the Physics on Stage festivals remained and still remains unchanged. In May 2008, the financial support of the European Commission ran out. In March 2009, under the guidance of Stage on Stage Germany [...] the 27 Europeancountries involved unanimously affirmed their wish to continue the cooperation. All participants stressed the importance of regular European festivals as the flagship of the European Science on Stage activities. Alternative funding would be sought for the festivals. In October 2008, the first of these alternatively funded Science on Stage festivals took place at Urania in Berlin, organised by Science on Stage Germany [...] and sponsored by THINK ING., an initiative of the Federation of German Employers‘ Associations in the Metal and Electrical Engineering Industries. The second alternatively funded European Science on Stage festival took place from 16-19 April 2011 at the Ørestad Gymnasium [...] in Copenhagen under the motto “Science Teaching: Winning Hearts and Minds”. It was funded by the Danish Ministry of Education and organised by Danish Science Communication and the Science on Stage Europe office. The next Science on Stage festival will take place from 25-28 April 2013 in Slubice and Frankfurt/Oder at the German-Polish border. For the first time, the festival will be organised by two countries, represented by the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poland and Science on Stage Germany, under the motto “Crossing Borders in Science Teaching”. 350 science teachers from across Europe will present their most innovative teaching ideas, workshops and performances. Participants are chosen at competitive national events or processes in each country involved.|$|E

40|$|Several studies, {{such as the}} SAS and ROSE studies, as well as every-day {{experience}} of many science teachers sug-gest a ‘disconnect ’ between the tenants of traditional, formal science teaching and contemporary youth culture. Clearly formal science teaching fails to stimulate the interest {{in science and technology}} among wider groups of youth. This has led to numerous proposals on how to improve science teaching at school and how to make it more attractive to pupils. Suggestions include the involvement of extra-curricular activities, e. g. in science centres, engagement by the media and by the scientific community itself. However, while functioning well on an individual basis, many of these proposals are hard to implement in a formal way and on a large scale because of ‘systemic ’ or institutional barriers. This paper describes a practical approach, led by the European Intergovernmental Research Organisations (in the <b>EIROforum</b> partnership), to foster innovative science teaching in a bottom-up approach across the European Union, while trying to embed this in a larger framework involving education administrators and policy-makers. 1...|$|E
40|$|Research {{infrastructures}} {{are one of}} the {{key elements}} for the development and the improvement of knowledge and technology in the European context. Commissioner Moedas affirmed in his Mission Statement that: “Improving research infrastructure and making better use of research results is essential to strengthen innovation further, develop new activities and boost the productivity and competitiveness of our economy”. The Informal Competitiveness Council of July 2014 highlighted the importance of long-term sustainability of RI, stressing that open access to RI and data, better links with industry and prioritisation based on a multi-level approach (national, European and international level) were key to ensure sustainability. Furthermore, RI need a long-term perspective for their construction and operation. Building on the achievements of the European Research Area and the Innovation Union flagship initiative, there is now a need to identify the next steps for a more comprehensive approach and vision on the long-term sustainability of RI, fully using their potential to deliver on the Commission priorities on open innovation, open science and open to the world. Given these premises, from 2 nd December 2015 to 1 st February 2016, the Commission opened an online Consultation on Long-term sustainability of Research Infrastructures with RI stakeholders, receiving 200 answers. The aim of this targeted consultation was to collect key stakeholders’ views on the interrelated pre-conditions that could ensure the long-term sustainability of RI and the potential actions/measures to tackle the challenges posed by their implementation. The pre-identified pre-conditions are Ensuring Scientific excellence, Skills of managers, operators and users, Unlocking Innovation potential of RI, Measuring socio-economic impact of RI, Exploiting better the data generated by the RI, RI Life cycle – Upgrading of RI, RI Life cycle – Decommissioning of RI, Ensuring sustainable governance of RI, Funding the construction and operation of RI and Structuring the international dimension of RI. For every pre-condition, the consultation provided a short explanation and {{a brief description of the}} issues at stake and possible actions. The communities targeted by the consultation were ERA stakeholders, ESFRI projects and ERICs, ESFRI delegations/ PC members, e-IRG, <b>EIROforum,</b> International Organizations, RI associations (e. g. ERF), NCPs (dissemination within key stakeholders), and Science attaches from strategic third country partners. Data were collected with an online semi-standardized questionnaire, i. e. with a mix of close-ended and open-ended questions. The qualitative open-ended questions addressed the most relevant topics in the survey, i. e. the measures to tackle the challenges posed by the pre-conditions for sustainability; this type of questions allowed interviewees to freely express their considerations in their own words allowing therefore for the possibility to deepen their answers with personal opinions and experiences. The response rate to the consultation was very high as was also the level of detail provided by the respondents in the open questions. This has positively impacted both on the quality and on the reliability of the consultation results. The responses have been subsequently analysed with the support of an external. An overview of the initial findings of the consultation was already presented on the occasion of the ESFRI Roadmap 2016 Update Launch event that took place on 10 March 2016 in Amsterdam. The final purpose of this consultation was to derive the main trends on RI sustainability, as perceived by the targeted communities, on which basis elements of an action plan can be developed in concertation with the main stakeholders. Therefore, this report presents such trends extracted from the responses received by the Commission services during the consultation. The report provides an overview of the methodology used for consultation, the profile of the respondents and a summary of the survey results...|$|E
40|$|In general, {{our society}} has no real views on or has an {{inappropriate}} idea about what engineering means. Everything related to pollution, bad usage {{of natural resources and}} human endeavours is connected to engineering. Modern society accepts the positive achievements that engineering has given us, but some people continue to hold a “negative opinion” related to technology. It is important to show and to explain to the general public that engineering generates many benefits to society. Communication is essential in our society. The Spanish programme “Ciencia en Acción” offers the possibility to link up with a general audience which has a positive approach to science, technology and engineering. This project began ten years ago from a group of scientist and engineers working in CERN, ESA and ESO who promoted a first meeting in Geneva, at CERN headquarters in order to give a message to European society by means of teachers and students. The main objectives of “Ciencia en Acción” are: • Finding new ideas to make science and technology attractive to the population • Pointing out the international character of science and technology • Promoting the interest in science for educators and students • Involving research in scientific and technologic communication activities • Showing the importance of science for progress and welfare in general. Our society continually needs more engineers and more from the engineers. If we want to change mind sets, we need to explain the applications and help the use of engineering to increase {{the quality of life of}} everybody in a sustainable manner. If we want to communicate successfully the advantages of engineering we must get close up to our audience. What are the facts that people remember best? Without doubt, the answer is “the facts involving positive emotions”. If we feel a passion related to some aspects of technology, we will remember it and we will add a positive connotation to engineering. This relationship will stay with the person for some time and it will be a cord that will not be broken easily. It is good that the experiences, and in special the first experiences with engineering, are exciting. If a child had a good feeling in the school when “making a device” with other children, he/she will continue with this positive feeling in the future. We must get the students to feel emotive in building simple devices or in solving some problems in the technological framework! School classes should offer some examples of this kind of experiences. We should use all the above mentioned strategies such as causing surprise, enthusiasm, encouraging the participation of everybody and to feel technology much more approach. These strategies can be presented in the “Ciencia en Acción” programme in order to show them to all the educational, scientific and technological communities. “Ciencia en Acción” programme is open to all the Spanish and Portuguese speaking countries and all the participants can present their contributions in any of the official languages in Spain and Portugal. The CSIC (Spanish National Research Council), INTA (National Institute for Aerospace Technology), the RSEF (Spanish Royal Physical Society), the SGE (Spanish Geologist Society) and the UNED (Spanish Open University) have annually organised “Ciencia en Acción” in order to increase the quality of science and technology communication and to promote innovation within science teaching. In the last edition of “Ciencia en Acción”, the Portuguese program “CienciaViva” (Portuguese Science Programme) has been integrated in the organisers group. This program moves Science and Engineering to the street by involving general audiences in both these areas. “Ciencia en Acción” increases in importance every year. The final event of the last edition grouped together about 15, 000 people in two days. “Ciencia en Acción” is integrated in the international program “Science on Stage” organised by the <b>EIROforum</b> (the CERN (European Organisation for Nuclear Research), the EFDA (European Fusion Development Agreement), the EMBL (European Molecular Biology Laboratory), the ESA (European Space Agency), the ESO (European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere), the ESRF (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility) and the ILL (Institute Laue-Langevin) with the financial support of the European Union. In the most recent editions of “Ciencia en Acción”, a specific category has been promoted in order to bring the general public closer to “Science, Engineering and Values”. Several proposals were presented within this new category: from university departments, from engineering teams, and from NGOs coming from Spanish and Portuguese speaking countries. This modality is sponsored by a chair linked to the Technical University of Catalonia and the leading electric company ENDESA showing that people involved in the management of public and private entities can reach agreement about the importance of the previously mentioned topics.
