5|$|Caterpillars undergo ecdysis {{and have}} a number of larval instars, usually five but varying between species. The new cuticle is soft and allows the {{increase}} in size and development of the caterpillar before becoming hard and inelastic. In the last ecdysis, the old cuticle splits and curls up <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> ball at the posterior end of the pupa and is known as the larval exuvia.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick dropped all {{his other}} {{responsibilities}} {{to concentrate on}} proving {{the existence of the}} neutron, assisted by Feather and frequently working late at night. He devised a simple apparatus that consisted of a cylinder containing a polonium source and beryllium target. The resulting radiation could then be directed at a material such as paraffin wax; the displaced particles, which were protons, would go <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> ionisation chamber where they could be detected with an oscilloscope.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to his Shakespearean commitments, Hordern joined the St Pancras People's Theatre, a London-based company partly funded by the theatrical manager Lilian Baylis. Hordern enjoyed his time there, despite the tiresome commute between Sussex and London, and stayed with the company for five years. By the end of 1936 {{he had left his}} sales job in Beaconsfield to pursue a full-time acting career. He moved <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> flat at Marble Arch and became one of the many jobbing actors eager {{to make a name for}} themselves on the London stage.|$|E
5|$|In meteorology, station {{models are}} {{symbolic}} illustrations showing the weather occurring {{at a given}} reporting station. Meteorologists created the station model to fit a number of weather elements <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> space on weather maps. This allows map users to analyze patterns in atmospheric pressure, temperature, wind speed & direction, cloud cover, precipitation, and other parameters. The most common station plots depict surface weather observations although upper air plots at various mandatory levels are also frequently depicted.|$|E

5|$|Solar {{power is}} the {{conversion}} of energy from sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), indirectly using concentrated solar power, or a combination. Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> beam. Photovoltaic cells convert light into an electric current using the photovoltaic effect.|$|E

5|$|The British Armed Forces use CS gas {{annually}} {{to test their}} CBRN equipment. During initial training they introduce recruits to CS gas by introducing them <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> enclosed space known as a Respirator Testing Facility (RTF) and igniting chemical tablets to induce CS production. After recruits have carried out their CBRN drills, they must remove their respirators {{so that they are}} exposed to the CS for up to 20 seconds to experience its effects and become confident their respirators work.|$|E

5|$|The debate {{took all}} day, and the votes were counted very late that night.

The ideas explained were divided <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> number of proposals, designated with the names of their main supporters, and the people then voted for one of those proposals. The voting lasted for a long time, and the result was to dismiss the Viceroy by a large majority: 155votes to69.|$|E

On 28 May, forced <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> pocket along the Leie river and after failed attempts {{to broker a}} ceasefire on the 27th, the Belgian king and military surrendered unconditionally. Belgian casualties during the campaign numbered some 6,000 killed and 15,850 wounded. Some 112,500 French and Belgian troops escaped to the UK via Dunkirk {{but the majority of}} the Belgian survivors were made prisoners of war and many were not released {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|Adults of Diphyllobothrium infest fish, and the juveniles use copepod {{crustaceans}} as intermediate hosts. Excreted proglottids {{release their}} eggs into the water, and the eggs hatch into ciliated, swimming larvae. If a larva is swallowed by a copepod, it sheds the cilia {{and the skin}} becomes a syncitium and the larva makes {{its way into the}} copepod's hemocoel (internal cavity that is {{the main part of the}} circulatory system) and attached itself with three small hooks. If the copepod is eaten by a fish, the larva metamorphoses <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> unsegmented tapeworm, drills through to the gut and becomes an adult.|$|E
5|$|After this, the Australian {{forces were}} heavily {{reinforced}} by the 7thDivision's 21st and 25th Brigades. Supported logistically by native Papuans who were recruited by the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit, often forcibly, to carry supplies and evacuate wounded personnel, the Australians pursued the Japanese back along the Kokoda Track. In early November, they had been forced <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> bridgehead on the north coast of Papua. Australian and US forces attacked the Japanese bridgehead in Papua in late November1942. The Allied force consisted of the exhausted 7thDivision and the inexperienced and ill-trained US 32ndInfantry Division, and was short of artillery and supplies. Due {{to a lack of}} supporting weapons and MacArthur and Blamey's insistence on a rapid advance the Allied tactics during the battle were centred on infantry assaults on the Japanese fortifications. These resulted in heavy casualties and the area was not secured until 22January1943.|$|E

5|$|All {{cetaceans}} are carnivorous and predatory. Toothed whales mostly feed on {{fish and}} cephalopods, followed by crustaceans and bivalves. Some may forage with {{other kinds of}} animals, such as other species of whales or certain species of pinnipeds. One common feeding method is herding, where a pod squeezes a school of fish <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> volume, known as a bait ball. Individual members then take turns plowing through the ball, feeding on the stunned fish. Coralling is a method where dolphins chase fish into shallow water to catch them more easily. Killer whales and bottlenose dolphins have also been known to drive their prey onto a beach to feed on it. Other whales with a blunt snout and reduced dentition rely on suction feeding. Though carnivorous, they house gut flora {{similar to that of}} terrestrial herbivores, probably a remnant of their herbivorous ancestry.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the single}} was directed by Wataru Takeishi. It opens with Hamasaki walking <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> orange-lit room with a black object on a stall. After touching it, the entire room starts to light up, and the singer subsequently walks around singing to the song; scenes are digitally-altered and edited during the process. Following the first chorus, Hamasaki is seen wearing a white outfit while a mysterious light shines around the room. The video subsequently ends with the singer sitting on a small chair, looking in the distance. The clip was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: A Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014), and the DVD and Blu-Ray re-release edition of her 2001 compilation album, A Best (2016). The visual was additionally used as the theme song for Japanese cosmetics company Aube's launch of their lipstick range, which led to Hamasaki becoming their spokeswoman and appearing in a campaign video.|$|E
5|$|Anticipating {{that people}} {{would come to the}} area to indulge in the newly fashionable pastime of sea-bathing, an {{activity}} with perceived health benefits, Tregonwell built a series of villas on his land between 1816 and 1822, which he hoped to let out. The common belief that pine-scented air was good for lung conditions, and in particular tuberculosis, prompted Tregonwell and Tapps to plant hundreds of pine trees. These early attempts to promote the town as a health resort meant that by the time Tregonwell had died in 1832, Bournemouth had grown <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> community with a scattering of houses, villas and cottages. The town would ultimately grow up around the scattered pines and tree-lined walk to the beach, later to become known as the Invalids' Walk.|$|E
