25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, my sisters and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, I {{was the only one who}} survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty. I remember as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. I was afraid to go to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> went in, I'd never come out alive. … Despite my fear of the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised myself that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses would believe that there is a God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E
500|$|A further ECM album, Chants, led by Taborn {{and with}} bassist Thomas Morgan and drummer Gerald Cleaver, was {{released}} in 2013. This was the trio's first release after eight years together. At this point, Taborn's comments on composition and group performance were: [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> created a context and then deferred, fully, to Gerald's and Thomas's sensibilities it would inherently be stimulating and would also challenge the context. [...] I'd much rather engage with the group, always, than have the format be 'piano adventures with supporting cast'." [...] This band began a tour of Europe in 2014, but Cleaver was replaced by J.T. Bates {{part of the way}} through it, owing to illness. Earlier the same year, Taborn played in a small group led by guitarist Bill Frisell. Taborn played as part of the Ches Smith Trio late in 2014 and toured with the percussionist and Mat Maneri early in 2016. His sixth album as leader, , {{was released in}} 2016. The trio recording, with Christian McBride on bass and Tyshawn Sorey on drums, employed compositions by John Zorn. Taborn's next ECM album was the quartet Daylight Ghosts, which combined electronic and acoustic elements.|$|E

I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> kept playing for the board I wasn't guaranteed any financial reward at all." ...|$|E

2500|$|Immediately {{after they}} were sent to Auschwitz, {{his mother and his}} younger sister were murdered. Wiesel and his father were {{selected}} to perform labor so long as they remained able-bodied, after which they were to be killed in the gas chambers. Wiesel and his father were later deported to the concentration camp at Buchenwald. Until that transfer, he admitted to Oprah Winfrey, his primary motivation for trying to survive Auschwitz was knowing that his father was still alive: [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> died, he would die." [...] After they were taken to Buchenwald, his father died before the camp was liberated. In Night, Wiesel recalled the shame he felt when he heard his father being beaten and was unable to help.|$|E
2500|$|Hitchcock {{returned}} to the UK for an extended visit in late 1943 and early 1944. While there he made two short films in French for the British Ministry of Information: Bon Voyage and Aventure Malgache. The two British propaganda films made for the Free French were the only films that Hitchcock made in the French language, and they [...] "feature typical Hitchcockian touches". On his motivation for making the films, Hitchcock stated: [...] "I {{felt the need to}} make a little contribution to the war effort, and I was both overweight and over-age for military service. I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> did nothing, I'd regret {{it for the rest of}} my life." [...] From late June to late July 1945, Hitchcock served as [...] "treatment advisor" [...] on a Holocaust documentary which used footage provided by the Allied Forces. It was produced by Sidney Bernstein of the British Ministry of Information, and was assembled in London. Bernstein brought his future 1948–49 production partner Hitchcock on board as a consultant for the film editing process for the British Ministry of Information and the American Office of War Information.|$|E
2500|$|Davis {{explained}} her viewpoint to a journalist: [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{continued to}} appear in any more mediocre pictures, I would have no career left worth fighting for." [...] Davis' counsel presented her complaints—{{that she could be}} suspended without pay for refusing a part, with the period of suspension added to her contract, that she could be called upon to play any part within her abilities regardless of her personal beliefs, that she could be required to support a political party against her beliefs, and that her image and likeness could be displayed in any manner deemed applicable by the studio. Jack Warner testified, and was asked, [...] "Whatever part you choose to call upon her to play, if she thinks she can play it, whether it is distasteful and cheap, she has to play it?" [...] Warner replied, [...] "Yes, she must play it." [...] The case, decided by Branson J. in the English High Court, was reported as Warner Bros. Studios Incorporated v. Nelson in [...] 1KB 209. Davis lost the case and returned to Hollywood, in debt and without income, to resume her career. Olivia de Havilland mounted a similar case in 1943 and won.|$|E

2500|$|Abe {{was arrested}} and interrogated over eight sessions. When asked why she had severed Ishida's genitalia, Abe replied, [...] "Because I couldn't take his head or body with me. I {{wanted to take the}} part of him that brought back to me the most vivid memories." [...] The {{interrogating}} officer was struck by Abe's demeanor when asked why she had killed Ishida. [...] "Immediately she became excited and her eyes sparkled in a strange way." [...] Her answer was: [...] "I loved him so much, I wanted him all to myself. But since we were not husband and wife, as long as he lived he could be embraced by other women. I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> killed him no other woman could ever touch him again, so I killed him....." [...] In attempting to explain what distinguished Abe's case from over a dozen other similar cases in Japan, William Johnston suggests that it is this answer which captured the imagination of the nation. [...] "She had killed not out of jealousy but out of love." [...] Mark Schreiber notes that the Sada Abe incident occurred {{at a time when the}} Japanese media were preoccupied with extreme political and military troubles, including the Ni Ni Roku incident and a looming full-scale war in China. He suggests that a sensationalistic sex scandal such as this served as a welcome national release from the disturbing events of the time. The incident also struck a chord with the ero-guro-nansensu ("erotic-grotesque-nonsense") style popular at the time, and the Sada Abe Incident came to represent that genre for years to come.|$|E
