25|$|As well as {{reviving}} the rallying program, one of Hayes first accomplishments was to sign relatively unknown Scottish racing driver Jackie Stewart. Stewart was attending the 1964 British International Motor Show at Earl's Court, London, when Hayes approached him and later offered Stewart £500 to promote Ford products in 1965, {{along with the}} white Ford Zodiac that was the centrepiece of Ford's exhibit to drive that year. Stewart later commented: “I didn’t know who Walter Hayes was, but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>know</b> that to have a contract with Ford Motor Company {{was a big deal}} with great opportunities for the future, even though I wasn’t yet aware that Ford would enter Formula One.” The relationship was to last forty years, and be so successful it was the model for other Formula One stars and motor manufacturers.|$|E
500|$|The {{resulting}} album, Highway 61 Revisited, {{has been}} described as [...] "Dylan's first purely 'rock' album", a realization of his wish to leave his old music format behind and move on from his all-acoustic first four albums and half-acoustic, half-electric fifth album, Bringing It All Back Home. Documentary director D. A. Pennebaker, who filmed Dylan on his acoustic UK tour in May 1965, has said: [...] "I didn't know {{that he was going to}} leave acoustic. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>know</b> that he was getting a little dragged by it." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{complete}} the band, Max chose Soulfly guitarist Marc Rizzo and vocalist Joe Duplantier of Gojira. Rizzo was his choice because, according to Max, he and Rizzo [...] "play together in Soulfly and musically {{we are like}} twin brothers". Max {{also said that he}} talked to Rizzo about going back to the roots of the mid-1980s thrash metal, which he did with Sepultura. Max continues, [...] "Marc was completely into it and he did great. He surpassed what I asked him to do." [...] Max stated that Duplantier was Gloria's idea, as he did not know him at all. He added, [...] "We had no idea who the guy is, he's from a different continent and we don't speak French. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>know</b> the Gojira CD. But I like the element of surprise and danger Joe brought." ...|$|E

500|$|Marshall later conceded that, [...] "I {{had never}} heard of atomic fission but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>know</b> that you could not build much of a plant, much less four of them for $90million." [...] A single TNT plant that Nichols had {{recently}} built in Pennsylvania had cost $128million. Nor were they impressed with estimates to the nearest order of magnitude, which Groves compared with telling a caterer to prepare for between ten and a thousand guests. A survey team from Stone & Webster had already scouted a site for the production plants. The War Production Board recommended sites around Knoxville, Tennessee, an isolated area where the Tennessee Valley Authority could supply ample electric power and the rivers could provide cooling water for the reactors. After examining several sites, the survey team selected one near Elza, Tennessee. Conant advised that it be acquired at once and Styer agreed but Marshall temporized, awaiting the results of Conant's reactor experiments before taking action. Of the prospective processes, only Lawrence's electromagnetic separation appeared sufficiently advanced for construction to commence.|$|E
500|$|In October 2009, {{the track}} was {{released}} as the album's buzz single, {{not intended to}} be the first release of Raymond v. Raymond, but to generate reception and feedback. In March 2010, Usher continued to support Garrett's original claims, stating the song was recorded before his marriage ended. Usher said in an interview for MTV News for promoting Raymond v. Raymond: [...] "I think people would have immediately alluded to the fact I was talking about my wife when I made that record — and now my ex-wife," [...] he said. [...] "When the song was recorded, I wasn't divorced. It was some reality in the contrast of trying to make it all work, having to balance a career and having a normal life. Coming in at 6 in the morning and arguing was a reality when you have those type of relationships. I felt that in a way, the story did touch on certain things at the time. I didn't know how realistic it would become. I didn't know I would become divorced. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>know</b> it spoke on the contrast between trying to balance this world of being married and having this responsibility that's like a marriage at the same time. The song spoke to that place. Unfortunately, it did become a reality." ...|$|E
2500|$|From August to October 2006, Lisa Mitchell rose to {{national}} prominence as a contestant on Australian Idol Season 4, performing cover versions {{and two of}} her own compositions, which were [...] "See It in Your Eyes" [...] and [...] "Too Far Gone". Mitchell had auditioned in Albury in April, aged 16, and moved through the selection process to the final six before being eliminated in mid-October. In June 2009 Mitchell reflected on her time on Australian Idol: [...] "I was uncomfortable with elements of the show and unhappy about the compromises sometimes. I didn’t know what I wanted with music but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>know</b> that I loved it. I think {{that was what the}} experience cemented. It’s taken {{me a long time to}} find my own way.

2500|$|Arthur Marks, a {{producer}} of Perry Mason, recalled Burr's talk of wives and children: [...] "I know he was just putting on a show. … That was my gut feeling. I think the wives and the loving women, the Natalie Wood thing, were {{a bit of a}} cover." [...] Dean Hargrove, executive producer of the Perry Mason television films, said in 2006, [...] "I had always assumed that Raymond was gay, because he had a relationship with Robert Benevides for a very long time. Whether or not he had relationships with women, I had no idea. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>know</b> that I had trouble keeping track of whether he was married or not in these stories. Raymond had the ability to mythologize himself, to some extent, and some of his stories about his past … tended to grow as time went by." ...|$|E
2500|$|I was {{not more}} than {{thirteen}} years old, when in my loneliness and destitution I longed for some one to whom I could go, as to a father and protector. The preaching of a white Methodist minister, named Hanson, was the means of causing me to feel that in God I had such a friend. He thought that all men, great and small, bond and free, were sinners {{in the sight of}} God: that they were by nature rebels against His government; and that they must repent of their sins, and be reconciled to God through Christ. I cannot say that I had a very distinct notion of what was required of me, but one thing <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>know</b> well: I was wretched and had no means of making myself otherwise.I consulted a good old colored man named Charles Lawson, and in tones of holy affection he told me to pray, and to [...] "cast all my care upon God." [...] This I sought to do; and though for weeks I was a poor, broken-hearted mourner, traveling through doubts and fears, I finally found my burden lightened, and my heart relieved. I loved all mankind, slaveholders not excepted, though I abhorred slavery more than ever. I saw the world in a new light, and my great concern was to have everybody converted. My desire to learn increased, and especially, did I want a thorough acquaintance with the contents of the Bible.|$|E
