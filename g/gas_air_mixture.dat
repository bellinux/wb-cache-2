In August 1864 Otto met Eugen Langen who, being technically trained, glimpsed {{the potential of}} Otto's development, and {{one month after the}} meeting, founded the first engine factory in the world, NA Otto & Cie, in Cologne. In 1867 Otto patented his improved design and it was awarded the Grand Prize at the 1867 Paris World Exhibition. This atmospheric engine worked by drawing a <b>mixture</b> of <b>gas</b> and <b>air</b> into a vertical cylinder. When the piston has risen about eight inches, the <b>gas</b> and <b>air</b> <b>mixture</b> is ignited by a small pilot flame burning outside, which forces the piston (which is connected to a toothed rack) upwards, creating a partial vacuum beneath it. No work is done on the upward stroke. The work is done when the piston and toothed rack descend under the effects of atmospheric pressure and their own weight, turning the main shaft and flywheels as they fall. Its advantage over the existing steam engine was its ability to be started and stopped on demand, making it ideal for intermittent work such as barge loading or unloading.|$|R

These holes are referred to as dirt purge holes and are generally required for manufacturing purposes and expelling dirt from the coolant flow when operating in sandy environments. Experiments were performed in a linear blade cascade for two tip gap heights over a range of blowing ratios. Results indicated that the cooling effectiveness was highly dependent upon the tip gap clearance with better cooling achieved at smaller clearances.

The gas mixture has a ratio of 70 % of CO 2 and 30 % of <b>air.</b> These <b>gases</b> were tested inside the pressure vessel and subjected to 1 bar (abs) pressure. Standard (1. 2 / 50 μs) lightning impulse was applied alongside with three electrode arrangements. The gap distance between electrodes is also varied ranging from 0. 5 cm to 2 cm. It was found that highest U 50 was recorded at the furthest gap length and when the insulating medium used was CO 2. The rising trend of U 50 is more obvious at sphere gaps as it provides more uniform fields. This U 50 was calculated by using up and down method. Moreover, the highest maximum electric field (Emax) was found at non-uniform field gap namely rod-sphere gaps whereas the values were obtained with the help of FEMM simulation software. The Emax of rod-sphere when the air is used as an insulating medium has revealed that it is directly proportional to the gap length in which probably due to the self-restoration of air at the non-uniform field is less compared to other gas hence causing the dropoff insulation strength. As the gap distance between electrodes is small, the highest field utilization factor was recorded which is 0. 93 (5 cm sphere), 0. 86 (2 cm sphere) and 0. 11 (rod-sphere) {{as a result of the}} field dispersed uniformly at short gaps.

Before cathodic polarization, a large polarization resistance (R-p) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was observed and methane did not cause obvious effect on ORR because of the weak adsorption of methane over LSM surface. Cathodic polarization could decrease the R-p obviously due to the in-situ creation of oxygen vacancies; methane likely adsorbed on those oxygen vacancy sites to enhance its effect on ORR. Both the anodic and cathodic polarizations significantly increased the rate of methane oxidation over LSM electrode; in particular, the pumped oxygen anion was highly active for methane oxidation.

Retarding the spark timing by 10 oCA caused a small reduction in the stable area, 20 oCA retard reduced the stable combustion area significantly, whereby stable combustion occurred within an area of gas fuel ratio of 10. Burn rate analysis indicated increased variability in both the flame development and rapid burn period. The increase in variability in the rapid burn period is greater than that associated with the flame development. The variability is magnified from flame development through the rapid burn phase. This finding was consistent for unstable combustion caused by exceeding {{chemical and}} physical limits. Engine out emissions were investigated and characterised using engine global state parameters, for example AFR, burned gas fraction, for both stable and unstable combustion conditions. Carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen emissions correlations were unaffected by the presence of unstable combustion events whereas hydrocarbon emissions showed a significant increase. The incorporation of these findings were implemented into an engine simulation (Nu-SIM V 8) investigating the impact for the New European Drive Cycle condition...|$|R

(Ha) -anesthetized frogs were equilibrated with 9. 5 % Freon- 22 (Fr, chlorodifluoromethane) and 1. 1 % Ha. Cutaneous elimina-tion of Fr, Ha, and COz {{into a small}} sample chamber on the abdomen was measured with a mass spectrometer. Introducing an <b>air</b> <b>mixture</b> into the lung decreased cutaneous Fr, Ha, and COz elimination. Lung inflation with an O 2 mixture decreased cutaneous gas elimination more than with the <b>air</b> <b>mixture.</b> Inflation with a Nz mixture had no effect. The response to lung inflation with the <b>air</b> <b>mixture</b> was not affected by adding 4. 8 % CO, to the <b>air</b> <b>mixture</b> or by atropine. Voluntary lung ventila-tion decreased CO * and Fr elimination. The results indicate that intrapulmonary O 2 is a factor regulating skin breathing.

40|$|Air {{pollution}} {{is one of}} the environmental problems that threaten the public health. The <b>air</b> is a <b>gas</b> <b>mixture.</b> <b>Air</b> {{pollution is}} defined as the existence in the amount of pollutants harmful to humans and other organisms in the atmosphere {{as a result of the}} natural or human activity thereby changing to the gas rates in the air. The negative effects of pollution-causing particles on the health are closely related to the chemical structure of particles, whether causing a fibrotic reaction, whether having an amorphous shape and the aerodynamic diameters of particles. The particles larger than 10 microns in aerodynamic diameter can not reach up to the alveoli, and can be removed by mucociliary system. If the particles are smaller than 10 microns, these particles can reach to the alveoli, and are closely associated with the cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. The concentration of these particles (PM 10) is used as an indicator of pollution, and creates the basis for air quality index. Air pollution has several negative effects such as blood pressure changes, atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, autonomic dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress etc. In this review, the effects of air pollution on the cardiovascular system will be examined, and the importance of this issue will be emphasized.

40|$|The {{clearance}} {{gap between}} {{the tip of a}} turbine blade and the shroud has an inherent leakage flow from the pressure side to the suction side of the blade. This leakage flow of combustion <b>gas</b> and <b>air</b> <b>mixtures</b> leads to severe heat-transfer rates to the blade tip of the high-pressure turbine. The subject of this paper is the cooling effectiveness levels that result from blowing through two holes placed in the forward region of a blade tip. These holes are referred to as dirt purge holes and are generally required for manufacturing purposes and for expelling dirt from the coolant flow when, for example, operating in sandy environments. A direct comparison of experimentally measured and computationally predicted adiabatic effectiveness levels for different blowing ratios and tip gaps show good agreement for the small tip clearance, but relatively poor agreement for a large tip clearance, which is attributed to an overprediction of the jet separation and attachment phenomena. Results indicate that the cooling effectiveness is highly dependent upon the tip clearance with good cooling achieved at low coolant flows (0. 19 % of the passage flow) for a small tip clearance. Even at twice the coolant flow (0. 38 % of the passage flow) the blade tip for a large tip clearance appeared to have much less cooling benefit from the dirt purge jets relative to the small tip clearance.
