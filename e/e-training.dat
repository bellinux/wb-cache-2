The {{purpose of the study}} was to evaluate the library training to determine the extent to which desired institutional outcomes and students’ needs were being met. During the 2007 - 2008 academic year, students received library training by completing an online tutorial known as the <b>e-train</b> module in their first year of study at the university. Data from 14 interviews conducted with librarians, faculty, and students; 100 graded etrain modules; student responses to an online library questionnaire regarding the <b>e-train</b> module; a document containing background information about the library training program for psychology students; and a Southern Association of Colleges and Schools library training report were reviewed and analyzed during the course of the study. Results indicated that the library training needed significant modifications, and students were not acquiring essential library skills. The institution’s librarians and faculty were also dissatisfied with the library training. Based on the study findings, recommendations for changes were provided to the school of psychology and the library. Recommended changes included developing more interactive training that incorporated multimedia elements and integrating library training into the psychology curriculum. In addition, library activities should be tied to specific assignments, and students should receive library training that builds sequentially and developmentally throughout the course of their programs.

5000|$|Marty (Thomas) and Susan (Crosby) Campbell are a {{small town}} couple visiting a large, {{somewhat}} unfriendly, declining northern city. They accidentally get lost and stranded in a deserted, rundown neighborhood after dark when Marty gets the wrong address for meeting a business client and are both left behind by a cab that drops Susan off after dark from shopping and whose taxi business requires callers to have business names and phone numbers before sending any cabs after dark. The parking lot that their rental car is in is locked until 6:00 AM, leaving them unable to retrieve it before then. After Marty barely escapes getting hit by a newspaper delivery truck, they both find a nearly deserted apartment building but no phone to use. Marty and Susan {{go back to the}} locked parking lot to try to get their rental car to drive back to their hotel. When Marty climbs the fence, two Dobermans attack him and he drops the car keys and barely escapes with his life. Marty calls the police from an outdated payphone that still requires coins to obtain a dial tone for emergency calls to try to get help but is told that since he trespassed on the locked parking lot, he can't file a complaint. Susan wanders away and is seen by a gang in a neighboring alley and runs back to Marty, who the police hung up on. They're chased through another alley and barely escape again. Marty finds another payphone that also needs coins for emergency calls and tries to get help again, but the gang leader catches him, forcing the usually non-violent Marty to fight back and barely escape again with Susan in tow. They hide in an abandoned theatre but flee when they find a corpse. Then they find a man and try to offer him money to drive them to their hotel, but the man is scared off. Next, they find an unstable derelict (Jeff Corey) who sends Marty on a wild sewer chase to a non existent police station. Marty and Susan leave the derelict and wander down another rundown, empty street, where Marty breaks store windows in frustration over the lack of police response, setting off its alarms. They're sent to a subway by an untrustworthy street kid only to find it locked to them, but also find a burglarized church that was vandalized by the gang and sneak into through its broken door. They find an incapacitated junkie whose also-druggie sister thinks they're inside a hospital and that Marty is a doctor. Another gang member appears, giving the sisters directions to another subway to get home, which Marty and Susan overhear while hiding, meaning that both of these girls are members of this gang. Marty's watch has stopped and they find the subway's revolving gate locked to them but manage to squeeze in just as the gang finds them again and chases them through the subway. Marty drives the <b>E-train</b> while the gang enters the train and pulls the cord to stop it. Marty and Susan abandon the train, Susan is sent to hide while Marty lures the gang into another tunnel, where he knocks a pile of rubble onto three of its members and lures its leader into the boiler room, blinding him with steam and beating him to death with a large wooden board. He goes back above ground and finds Susan telling a policeman (Dennis Farina) about their ordeal, who ironically, says [...] "Glad to be of service" [...] to a disgusted Marty. They go to their hotel to get cleaned up and change their clothes, return to the parking lot to retrieve their rental car and drive away after paying a $5.00 overnight fee to its attendant that found its keys but has no change if they didn't have the exact amount. The attendant tells them to be more careful next time and Marty and Susan drive off towards home.|$|R

50|$|A {{significant}} portion of K.Radhakrishnan’s career has been dedicated to empowerment of the women police personnel of Tamil Nadu. Women Police, who were inducted into the Tamil Nadu Police force in 1973 were initially concerned with protection of accused women in police custody and in assisting investigating officers during interrogation and examination of women prisoners/witnesses. However, {{with the introduction of}} All Women Police Stations (AWPSs) from 1993, their numbers escalated and correspondingly, the significance of their roles increased too with their duties covering resolution of family disputes and handling of dowry and other domestic-abuse issues. In 2001 when the women police force was integrated into the regular police force, K.Radhakrishnan (then, the Deputy Inspector General of Police, Police Training College, Chennai) was tasked with gender-sensitization of 4200 women police personnel who were in service, through a 42-week long gender sensitization program held at the Police Training College. Upon receiving an excellent reception to the workshops, the Government of Tamil Nadu extended the program to cover the existing police force in its entirety which numbered to a lakh.The program proved to be a useful platform through which the various inadequacies of the women police personnel in handling family disputes and other domestic conflicts were thrown into light. Leveraging the experiences of this program, K.Radhakrishnan, upon consultation with experts in the field of mediation, negotiation, arbitration and counselling, kick-started the demonstrative project: “Web-based <b>e-training</b> programs in <b>e-training</b> programs in dispute resolution, interviewing and record keeping for officers in all-women police stations in Tamil Nadu: a Pilot Project”. This project was his entry for the United Kingdom Home Office’s award: Queen’s Award for Innovation in Police Training and Development. K.Radhakrishnan’s project, competing under the head “The use of new technologies to overcome barriers to deliver training and lifelong learning” amongst entries by officers belonging to 53 member nations of the Commonwealth, was the recipient of the prestigious award in 2002. Awarded with a competitive grant of 15,000 pounds, he successfully implemented the project as a program in Tamil Nadu. Several DVDs containing interactive modules on dispute resolution, interviewing and record-keeping were released to various police stations during implementation. The project’s implementation allowed women officers, access to training materials from their station premises, which eliminated the need to transport large numbers of officers to the state-capital for the purpose of training. Select officers were trained in familiarization workshops that were held in Chennai and were presided over by Mr.K.Radhakrishnan and the Queen’s Award project director Dr. Mangai Natarajan. Study materials and user-guides were posted on the project website, with access to chat-room and forum facilities for exchange of guidance and support between officials in handling dispute and abuse cases. Computers with keyboards were set up at each station in Tamil Nadu, along with adequate telephone lines and internet connections, making this a pioneering project in online-police training in India. In recognition of his efforts, the then Hon’ble Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Jayalalithaa felicitated him with a silver plaque on the occasion of Tamil Nadu Police Medal Parade, 2002 at Chennai. With the project’s results garnering acclaim amongst the media and government intelligentsia, it was covered in police educational literature and various research journals. K.Radhakrishnan was invited to discuss the benefits and results of this experiment in conferences both in India and abroad.|$|E

40|$|A close {{examination}} of new hybrid <b>e-training</b> programmes, for determining programme quality, exposed a critical disparity between rapid technological advancements and established pedagogical models. The objective of this study was, therefore, to develop, generate, test, and validate a two-stage model for a meaningful hybrid <b>e-training</b> programme. An early framework of the model helped develop a questionnaire to measure the meaningfulness of a hybrid <b>e-training</b> programme. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed using AMOS 7. 0 on data collected from 213 trainees to obtain three best-fit measurement models from three latent variables. Overall reliability analyses, using Cronbach’s Alpha and the Rasch Model, in addition to content validation by experts, suggested that the questionnaire was reliable and valid for measuring a meaningful hybrid <b>e-training</b> programme. Subsequently, structural equation modelling was applied to test the hypotheses. The results showed a strong positive relationship between hybrid <b>e-training</b> and meaningful <b>e-training,</b> a weak positive relationship between learning style preference and hybrid <b>e-training,</b> and a negative relationship between learning style preference and meaningful learning. In brief, the study proved that hybrid <b>e-training</b> contributed significantly towards achieving meaningful learning. Consequently, future training, {{with respect to the}} use of hybrid <b>e-training,</b> should include all the five components of meaningful hybrid <b>e-training</b> instead of focusing on the content alone.

Design/methodology/approach– This paper is based on a review of past literature from databases, reports, newspapers, magazines, etc. The literature recognised the role of perceived cost, computer self-efficacy, availability of resources and perceived support in <b>e-training</b> adoption. Using technology acceptance model (TAM), this paper explained the importance of these variables in <b>e-training</b> adoption in developing country context. Findings – The authors found that the combined role of perceived cost, computer self-efficacy, technological infrastructure, Internet facilities, power supply, organisational support, technical support and government support is critical for <b>e-training</b> adoption in developing countries, particularly in Nigeria. Thus, the authors proposed the combination of these variables which would encourage future research on the use of TAM in technology adoption. Research limitations/implications – This paper gives an elaboration of the role of computer self-efficacy, perceived cost, availability of resources and perceived support with TAM as base of the framework. This provides researchers the opportunity to test the proposed framework empirically and further suggest other variables that can aid <b>e-training</b> adoption in the context of developing country.

40|$|Background: Among staff {{working in}} elderly care, a {{considerable}} proportion lack formal competence for their work. Lack of formal competence, in turn, {{has been linked}} to higher staff ratings of stress symptoms, sleep disturbances and workload. Objectives: 1) To describe {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} an e-assessment and subsequent <b>e-training</b> program used among elderly care staff who lack formal competence and 2) to study the effects of an <b>e-training</b> program on staff members' working life (quality of care and psychological and structural empowerment) and well-being (job satisfaction and psychosomatic health). The hypothesis was that staff who had completed the e-assessment and the <b>e-training</b> program would rate greater improvements in working life and well-being than would staff who had only participated in the e-assessments. Methods: An intervention study with a mixed-methods approach using quantitative (2010 - 2011) and qualitative data (2011) was conducted in Swedish elderly care. Participants included a total of 41 staff members. To describe the strengths and weaknesses of the e-assessment and the <b>e-training</b> program, qualitative data were gathered using semi-structured interviews together with a study-specific questionnaire. To study the effects of the intervention, quantitative data were collected using questionnaires on: job satisfaction, psychosomatic health, psychological empowerment, structural empowerment and quality of care in an intervention and a comparison group. Results: Staff who completed the e-assessments and the <b>e-training</b> program primarily experienced strengths associated with this approach. The results were also in line with our hypotheses: Staff who completed the e-assessment and the <b>e-training</b> program rated improvements in their working life and well-being. Conclusion: Use of the e-assessments and <b>e-training</b> program employed in the present study could be one way to support elderly care staff who lack formal education by increasing their competence; increased competence, in turn, could improve their self-confidence, working life, and well-being.
