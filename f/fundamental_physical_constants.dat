5|$|<b>Fundamental</b> <b>physical</b> <b>constants</b> {{are often}} highly {{dependent}} upon each other. This {{implies that the}} best value of a fundamental physical constant, one with the least uncertainty, often can be determined by directly measuring other <b>fundamental</b> <b>physical</b> <b>constants,</b> from which the value can be calculated. The uncertainty in these constants is then determined from {{the uncertainty of the}} others by the propagation of uncertainty. Constants whose value is fixed, for determining the units in which they are expressed, don't have an uncertainty associated with them, so they do not account for any extra uncertainty {{in the value of the}} calculated constant. One of the reasons the SI unit system will be changed is that determination of values can often be greatly improved if expressed in these new units. This is due to the dependence of these values on physical constants.|$|E
5|$|The {{fine-tuned}} Universe is {{the proposition}} that the conditions that allow life in the Universe can only occur when certain universal <b>fundamental</b> <b>physical</b> <b>constants</b> lie within a very narrow range, so that if any of several fundamental constants were only slightly different, the Universe would be unlikely to be conducive to the establishment and development of matter, astronomical structures, elemental diversity, or life as it is understood. The proposition is discussed among philosophers, scientists, theologians, and proponents of creationism.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014 the {{kilogram}} was {{the only}} SI unit still defined by an artifact. In 1960 the metre having previously also been defined by reference to an artifact (a single platinum-iridium bar with two marks on it) was redefined in terms of invariant, <b>fundamental</b> <b>physical</b> <b>constants</b> (the wavelength of a particular emission of light emitted by krypton, and later the speed of light) so that the standard can be reproduced in different laboratories by following a written specification. At the 94th Meeting of the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) (2005) it was recommended that the same {{be done with the}} kilogram.|$|E
50|$|The term <b>fundamental</b> <b>physical</b> <b>constant</b> is {{sometimes}} {{used to refer}} to universal but dimensioned <b>physical</b> <b>constants</b> such as those mentioned above.Increasingly, physicists reserve {{the use of the term}} <b>fundamental</b> <b>physical</b> <b>constant</b> for dimensionless <b>physical</b> <b>constants,</b> such as the fine-structure constant α.|$|R
50|$|The term <b>fundamental</b> <b>physical</b> <b>constant</b> is {{also used}} to refer to {{universal}} but dimensioned <b>physical</b> <b>constants</b> such as the speed of light c, vacuum permittivity ε0, Planck constant h, and the gravitational constant G.Increasingly, physicists reserve {{the use of the term}} <b>fundamental</b> <b>physical</b> <b>constant</b> for dimensionless <b>physical</b> <b>constants</b> that cannot be derived from any other source.|$|R

5|$|The {{following}} table catalogues {{the notable}} changes in determination of <b>fundamental</b> <b>physical</b> <b>constants.</b> The constants {{are expressed in}} direct measurements and fixed constants to minimize and determine the uncertainty. Some constants in that expression do not contribute significantly to the uncertainty; only the significant factors are noted. The value of the relative uncertainty by the data of CODATA of 2014 is given, and is expressed in the relative uncertainty of the significant factors, noted with ur(constant). An approximately equals sign (≈) is used if an uncertainty is only approximated by the expression. This is due to unsignificant factors or rounding errors.|$|E
5|$|The {{long-term}} {{solution to this}} problem, however, is to liberate the SI system's dependency on the IPK by developing a practical realization of the kilogram that can be reproduced in different laboratories by following a written specification. The units of measure in such a practical realization would have their magnitudes precisely defined and {{expressed in terms of}} <b>fundamental</b> <b>physical</b> <b>constants.</b> While major portions of the SI system would still be based on the kilogram, the kilogram would in turn be based on invariant, universal constants of nature. Much work towards that end is ongoing, though no alternative has yet achieved the uncertainty of 20 parts per billion (~20µg) required to improve upon the IPK.|$|E
25|$|This {{can be seen}} {{as simply}} the classic design {{argument}} restated in the garb of contemporary cosmology. It implies {{that the purpose of the}} universe is to give rise to intelligent life, with the laws of nature and their <b>fundamental</b> <b>physical</b> <b>constants</b> set to ensure that life as we know it will emerge and evolve.|$|E
50|$|The vacuum {{energy in}} {{quantum field theory}} can be set to any value by renormalization. This view treats the cosmological {{constant}} as simply another <b>fundamental</b> <b>physical</b> <b>constant</b> not predicted by theory.|$|R

50|$|A <b>physical</b> <b>constant,</b> {{sometimes}} <b>fundamental</b> <b>physical</b> <b>constant,</b> is a <b>physical</b> quantity that {{is generally}} {{believed to be}} both universal in nature and having constant value in time.

25|$|The model's key success lay in {{explaining}} the Rydberg formula for the spectral emission lines of atomic hydrogen. While the Rydberg formula had been known experimentally, it did not gain a theoretical underpinning until the Bohr model was introduced. Not only did the Bohr model explain {{the reason for the}} structure of the Rydberg formula, it also provided a justification for its empirical results in terms of <b>fundamental</b> <b>physical</b> <b>constants.</b>|$|E
25|$|The anthropic {{principle}} is a philosophical consideration that {{observations of the}} Universe must be compatible with the conscious and sapient life that observes it. Some proponents of the {{anthropic principle}} reason that it explains why this universe has the age and the <b>fundamental</b> <b>physical</b> <b>constants</b> necessary to accommodate conscious life. As a result, they believe it is unremarkable that this universe has fundamental constants that happen to fall within the narrow range thought to be compatible with life.|$|E
25|$|The {{elementary}} charge {{is one of}} the <b>fundamental</b> <b>physical</b> <b>constants,</b> and accurate knowledge of its value is of great importance. His experiment measured the force on tiny charged droplets of oil suspended against gravity between two metal electrodes. Knowing the electric field, the charge on the droplet could be determined. Repeating the experiment for many droplets, Millikan showed that the results could be explained as integer multiples of a common value (1.592 × 10−19 coulomb), which is the charge of a single electron. That this is somewhat lower than the modern value of 1.602 176 53(14) x 10−19 coulomb is probably due to Millikan's use of an inaccurate value for the viscosity of air.|$|E
5000|$|In atomic physics, sub-atomic physics, and cosmology, the {{preferred}} {{unit of length}} is often related to a chosen <b>fundamental</b> <b>physical</b> <b>constant,</b> or combination thereof.

50|$|In 1912, Tetrode {{developed}} the Sackur-Tetrode equation, a quantum mechanical {{expression of the}} entropy of an ideal gas. Otto Sackur derived this equation independently around the same time. The Sackur-Tetrode constant, S0/R, is a <b>fundamental</b> <b>physical</b> <b>constant</b> representing the translational contribution to the entropy of an ideal gas at a temperature of 1 K and pressure of 100 kPa, where R is the gas constant.|$|R
25|$|The SI {{base unit}} of mass is the {{kilogram}} which was originally defined in 1795 as the mass of one litre of water at the temperature of melting ice (0°C), though to ensure greater consistency of kilogram artefacts, {{and to create a}} practical physical realisation of the kilogram, a platinum artefact intended to have the mass of precisely 1kg was manufactured and placed in the French Archives in 1799. This artefact was replaced by one of British manufacture in 1889 which then became, and is still (as of 2013), the definitive kilogram, although it is anticipated that the kilogram will be redefined in terms of <b>fundamental</b> <b>physical</b> <b>constants</b> in the near future, thus bringing it in line with the other SI base units.|$|E

2500|$|Atomic units (au or a.u.) form {{a system}} of natural units which is {{especially}} convenient for atomic physics calculations. There are two different kinds of atomic units, Hartree atomic units and Rydberg atomic units, which differ {{in the choice of}} the unit of mass and charge. This article deals with Hartree atomic units, where the numerical values of the following four <b>fundamental</b> <b>physical</b> <b>constants</b> are all unity by definition: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{probability}} of observing value X is then proportional to N(X) P(X). A generic feature of {{an analysis of}} this nature is that the expected values of the <b>fundamental</b> <b>physical</b> <b>constants</b> should not be [...] "over-tuned", i.e. {{if there is some}} perfectly tuned predicted value (e.g. zero), the observed value need be no closer to that predicted value than what is required to make life possible. The small but finite value of the cosmological constant can be regarded as a successful prediction in this sense.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are fine}} tuning {{arguments}} that are naturalistic. As modern cosmology developed, various hypotheses have been proposed. One is an oscillatory universe or a multiverse, where <b>fundamental</b> <b>physical</b> <b>constants</b> are postulated to resolve themselves to random values in different iterations of reality. Under this hypothesis, separate parts of reality would have wildly different characteristics. In such scenarios, {{the issue of}} fine-tuning does not arise at all, as only those [...] "universes" [...] with constants hospitable to life (such as what we observe) would develop life capable of contemplating {{the question of the}} origin of fine-tuning.|$|E
5000|$|In physics, the fine-structure constant, {{also known}} as Sommerfeld's constant, {{commonly}} denoted α (the Greek letter alpha), is a <b>fundamental</b> <b>physical</b> <b>constant</b> characterizing {{the strength of the}} electromagnetic interaction between elementary charged particles. It is related to the elementary charge e, which characterizes the strength of the coupling of an elementary charged particle with the electromagnetic field, by the formula 4πε0ħcα = e2. Being a dimensionless quantity, it has the same numerical value of about [...] in all systems of units. Arnold Sommerfeld introduced the fine-structure constant in 1916.|$|R
50|$|The fine-structure {{constant}} α is {{the best}} known dimensionless <b>fundamental</b> <b>physical</b> <b>constant.</b> It {{is the value of}} the elementary charge squared expressed in Planck units. This value has become a standard example when discussing the derivability or non-derivability of <b>physical</b> <b>constants.</b> Introduced by Arnold Sommerfeld, its value as determined at the time was consistent with 1/137. This motivated Arthur Eddington (1929) to construct an argument why its value might be 1/137 precisely, which related to the Eddington number, his estimate of the number of protons in the Universe. By the 1940s, {{it became clear that the}} value of the fine-structure constant deviates significantly from the precise value of 1/137, refuting Eddington's argument.|$|R

According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, what we measure as {{the speed of}} light in a vacuum (or near vacuum) is actually the <b>fundamental</b> <b>physical</b> <b>constant</b> c. This means that all inertial observers, regardless of their relative velocity, will always measure zero-mass particles such as photons traveling at c in a vacuum.

2500|$|Weak anthropic {{principle}} (WAP) (Barrow and Tipler): [...] "The observed values of all physical and cosmological quantities are not equally probable but {{they take on}} values restricted by the requirement that there exist sites where carbon-based life can evolve and by the requirements that the universe be old enough for it to have already done so."Unlike Carter they restrict the principle to carbon-based life, rather than just [...] "observers". A more important difference is that they apply the WAP to the <b>fundamental</b> <b>physical</b> <b>constants,</b> such as the fine structure constant, the number of spacetime dimensions, and the cosmological constant—topics that fall under Carter's SAP.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{applications}} of the anthropic principle have been criticized as an argument by lack of imagination, for tacitly assuming that carbon compounds and water are the only possible chemistry of life (sometimes called [...] "carbon chauvinism", see also alternative biochemistry). The range of <b>fundamental</b> <b>physical</b> <b>constants</b> consistent with the evolution of carbon-based life may also be wider than those who advocate a fine tuned universe have argued. For instance, Harnik et al. propose a weakless universe in which the weak nuclear force is eliminated. They show that this has no {{significant effect on the}} other fundamental interactions, provided some adjustments are made in how those interactions work. However, if some of the fine-tuned details of our universe were violated, that would rule out complex structures of any kind—stars, planets, galaxies, etc.|$|E
