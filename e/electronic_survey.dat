5000|$|In applied statistics, (e.g., {{applied to}} the social {{sciences}} and psychometrics), common-method variance (CMV) is the spurious [...] "variance that is attributable to the measurement method rather than to the constructs the measures are assumed to represent" [...] or equivalently as [...] "systematic error variance shared among variables measured with and introduced {{as a function of the}} same method and/or source". For example, an <b>electronic</b> <b>survey</b> method might influence results for those who might be unfamiliar with an <b>electronic</b> <b>survey</b> interface differently than for those who might be familiar. If measures are affected by CMV or common-method bias, the intercorrelations among them can be inflated or deflated depending upon several factors.

Tuten Foot in the Electronic Door 4 Getting a foot in the electronic door: Understanding why people read or delete electronic mail For researchers, a key issue in developing electronic mail as a survey method is to understand what factors are at play as a potential respondent chooses to open or delete a mail message. This research investigated {{the process by which}} individuals make decisions about opening and reading versus deleting electronic mail and also assessed attitudes towards <b>electronic</b> mail <b>surveys.</b> The sample received an electronic mail message followed by a telephone interview. Results indicated that individuals delete mail when the subject line does not interest them or when they do not recognize the name of the individual sending the email. Those interviewed reacted favorably to <b>electronic</b> mail <b>surveys</b> for scientific research despite issues of anonymity.

We also documented, using qualitative approaches, field workers, whom we called 'enumerators', and households' members on the use of both methods. Existing administrative records were combined with logistics expenditure measured directly from comparison households to approximate annual costs per 1, 000 households surveyed.; Errors were detected in 17 % (166) of households for the paper records and 2 % (15) for the electronic records (p <  0. 001). There were differences in the types of errors (p =  0. 03). Of the errors occurring, a higher proportion were due to accuracy in paper surveys (79 %, 95 % CI: 72 %, 86 %) compared with <b>electronic</b> <b>surveys</b> (58 %, 95 % CI: 29 %, 87 %). Errors in <b>electronic</b> <b>surveys</b> {{were more likely to be}} related to completeness (32 %, 95 % CI 12 %, 56 %) than in paper surveys (11 %, 95 % CI: 7 %, 17 %).

40|$|This paper uses a {{case study}} {{approach}} to consider {{the effectiveness of the}} <b>electronic</b> <b>survey</b> as a research tool to measure the learner voice about experiences of e-learning in a particular institutional case. Two large scale electronic surveys were carried out for the Student Experience of e-Learning (SEEL) project at the University of Greenwich in 2007 and 2008, funded by the UK Higher Education Academy (HEA). The paper considers this case to argue that, although the electronic web-based survey is a convenient method of quantitative and qualitative data collection, enabling higher education institutions swiftly to capture multiple views of large numbers of students regarding experiences of e-learning, for more robust analysis, <b>electronic</b> <b>survey</b> research is best combined with other methods of in-depth qualitative data collection. The advantages and disadvantages of the <b>electronic</b> <b>survey</b> as a research method to capture student experiences of e-learning are the focus of analysis in this short paper, which reports an overview of large-scale data collection (1, 000 + responses) from two electronic surveys administered to students using surveymonkey as a web-based survey tool as part of the SEEL research project. Advantages of web-based <b>electronic</b> <b>survey</b> design include flexibility, ease of design, high degree of designer control, convenience, low costs, data security, ease of access and guarantee of confidentiality combined with researcher ability to identify users through email addresses. Disadvantages of <b>electronic</b> <b>survey</b> design include the self-selecting nature of web-enabled respondent participation, which tends to skew data collection towards students who respond effectively to email invitations. The relative inadequacy of electronic surveys to capture in-depth qualitative views of students is discussed with regard to prior recommendations from the JISC-funded Learners' Experiences of e-Learning (LEX) project, in consideration of the results from SEEL in-depth interviews with students. The paper considers the literature on web-based and email <b>electronic</b> <b>survey</b> design, summing up the relative advantages and disadvantages of electronic surveys as a tool for student experience of e-learning research.

40|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>surveys</b> {{have been}} the most obvious and most {{promising}} developments among the many changes occurring in survey environments. In our research during a few years, we encountered many changes in this field with both positive and negative characteristics. Our research has had two main purposes. Firstly, we have sought to clarify in the light of practical methodology what social and legal problems are involved in new survey methods, namely, Web-based or Internet surveys. Secondly, we have attempted a systematic study of the relationships that exist between conventional approaches and the more recent survey methods. This study has dealt with such aspects as design of a sample survey, including sampling methods, the construction of questionnaire sheets on Web pages, and actual survey procedures. Web-based surveys are widely used today, especially in the field of market research, and various attempts have been made by others engaged in survey research to find replacements for conventional interviewing, mailing and Omnibus surveys.

40|$|Using the Internet {{to conduct}} {{quantitative}} research presents challenges {{not found in}} conventional research. Some of our knowledge concerning the effective design and use of paper-based surveys does translate into electronic formats. However, <b>electronic</b> <b>surveys</b> have distinctive technological, demographic and response characteristics that affect how they should be designed, when {{they can be used}} and how they can be implemented. Survey design, subject privacy and confidentiality, sampling and subject solicitation, distribution methods and response rates and survey piloting are critical methodological components that must be addressed in order to conduct sound online research. This paper focuses on those distinctive characteristics. It reviews the current literature on the subject of <b>electronic</b> <b>surveys</b> and presents guidelines for designing, developing and implementing them, particularly web-based surveys. This paper argues that Web-based surveys are superior to email surveys in many aspects, but that email combined, perhaps with offline media, is an excellent vehicle for inviting individuals to participate in Web-based surveys. The application of these guidelines are demonstrated through the authors’ current research involving defining the nature of “non-public participation” (commonly referred to as lurking) in online discussion groups.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze heterogeneous perceptions of the relative importance of riverine ecosystem services to inform policy decisions. To improve allocation of scarce resources across competing uses, it is crucial to understand the values placed on various water uses. Based on <b>electronic</b> <b>surveys</b> conducted across three transboundary river basins—the Indus, Mekong, and Niger—we assess how perceptions of ecosystem services provided by these river basins differ by geography within and across basins, by type of respondent, and under alternative future conditions. The results reveal regions within each basin that are deemed to be most at risk ecologically and identify services with the most pressing need for investment. Water for irrigation and energy production are considered the most important services across all basins, with importance shifting from energy to food production from upstream to downstream. Comparative analysis reveals that perceptions are influenced to some extent by the technical and organizational background of stakeholders. These results emphasize the need for diverse stakeholders to be involved in water resources decision-making processes.
