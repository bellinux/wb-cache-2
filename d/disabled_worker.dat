40|$|Even though {{part-time}} jobs offer lower pay, fewer benefits, and less stability, voluntary part-time employment among <b>disabled</b> <b>workers</b> has {{increased over the}} past twenty years even as part-time work has declined among nondisabled workers. Does this trend signal that part-time work has become more attractive to <b>disabled</b> <b>workers,</b> or does it mean that <b>disabled</b> <b>workers</b> are being pushed to the fringe in the workforce?; This article attempts to answer these questions by looking at the part-time employment experience of <b>disabled</b> <b>workers</b> since 1984. Using data from the Current Population Survey, the author first examines how the incidence and nature of {{part-time jobs}} among workers with disabilities have changed over time compared with the experiences of nondisabled workers. Second, she analyzes U. S. Labor Department job descriptions for a broad range of occupations to see how the qualitative nature of jobs has changed over time.; Her analysis indicates that <b>disabled</b> <b>workers</b> are not being marginalized and are finding part-time employment more attractive. One explanation for the latter finding is that employers are increasingly accommodating the needs of <b>disabled</b> <b>workers,</b> offering them part-time jobs that would be available only on a full-time basis to nondisabled workers. Since the data show that the quality of part-time jobs held by <b>disabled</b> <b>workers</b> has not become relatively more attractive, a second, more likely explanation is that policy changes such as extended Medicaid and more generous Social Security Disability Insurance benefits have made part-time employment more financially attractive to <b>disabled</b> <b>workers.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} Japanese employment quota system for disabled people on their employment. By using official data pertaining to Japan, we show that a levy-grant scheme increases the employment of <b>disabled</b> <b>workers</b> in Japan’s manufacturing industry. In addition, we find that small-sized firms hire <b>disabled</b> <b>workers</b> when increasing firm size, although they are not obligated to pay a levy. Finally, we use {{the increase in the}} number of <b>disabled</b> <b>workers</b> by the quota system as an instrumental variable (IV) to evaluate the impact of disability employment on a firm’s profit rate. The results of the fuzzy regression discontinuity design (RDD) suggest that an increase in the number of <b>disabled</b> <b>workers</b> does not necessarily decrease firms’ profit rates, which is in contrast to the results of the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression that suggest negative relationships between a firm’s profit rate and the number of <b>disabled</b> <b>workers...</b>|$|R

50|$|The word {{disability}} carries few positive connotations {{for most}} employers.

Hiring disabled workers produce more advantages than disadvantages.

These initiatives - each deeply rooted in Watson's personal values system - became core aspects of IBM culture for the remainder of the century.|$|E

50|$|An {{official}} at the Ministry of Labour said inspection teams from the ministry are closely monitoring companies who have been exploiting people with disabilities {{in order to encourage}} their Saudization rates. The officials check on employees with disabilities during inspection rounds to identify the nature of the work, their presence at the job, and the type of arrangements and services provided to them, noting that the number of people with disabilities employed at a facility cannot exceed 10 percent. If employees with disabilities in a firm exceed more than 10 percent {{of the total number of}} Saudi employees, then each <b>disabled</b> <b>worker</b> is calculated like any other Saudi. “It is unfortunate that there are some companies and individuals who exploit people with disabilities to pump up their Saudization rates,”and Saudi workers with disabilities who are able to work are counted as four employees in the Saudization ratio. They must be paid a minimum monthly wage of 3,000 riyals and should not be counted as part of the Saudization ratio of another establishment. To recent reports which reveal that companies have been hiring Saudis with disabilities in order to boost Saudization rates as these disabled employees count as 4 employees, thus saving the company from hiring able-bodied Saudi employees at higher salaries. An executive at a private company said there are some people with disabilities who present themselves to the companies for employment in return for salaries, bonuses, and benefits. Companies are thus paying less to a disabled employee who is equal to four Saudis than they would if they hired four Saudis with salaries of more than SR 20,000 each. They offer their services. Some companies accept, refuse, others added. The Ministry of Labour and other agencies work together regarding the issue of employees with disabilities, noting that the Ministry of Labor determines the nature of disability upon interviewing the employee. They currently posted a draft to the disability employment legislation on the “Together We Improve” portal for discussion before making a decision to amend the definition of disability work and conditions for employment stipulated in Article 13. Disabled employee to count as more than one employee in Nitaqat, the individual must hold a license or identification card from the Ministry of Social Affairs or Ministry of Labor indicating the type and degree of disability. Further, work conditions and systems must be acceptable and suitable for employees based on the type of disability, and establishments should ensure all services are in place before the employee begins work.|$|E

During the last decade, ensuring an early and safe return to work (RTW) has been high on the political agenda in many European countries [1]. However, RTW after long-term sick-ness absence is a complex phenomenon, which often involves {{a wide range of}} stakeholders, such as employers, social insurance officers, and health-care professionals [2 – 4].
