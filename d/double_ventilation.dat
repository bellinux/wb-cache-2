50|$|A bunker {{commonly}} has two doors, one {{of which}} is convenient, and in peace time use, and the other is strong. Naturally, the shelter must always have a secondary exit which can be used if the primary door is blocked by debris.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} the effects of <b>doubling</b> minute <b>ventilation</b> (either by <b>doubling</b> ventilator frequency [Freq] or tidal volume [VT]) and of normal minute ventilation prolonged to 12 -fold duration, synchronously at biophysical, biochemical/cellular, histological, and transcriptional levels in a model of mild lung injury. A prospective, randomized study was performed on adolescent New-Zealand white rabbits. The rabbits were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: control (normal minute ventilation for 0. 5 hours); 1 × VT, 12 -fold prolongation at normal VT (normal minute ventilation for 6 hours [12 × 0. 5 hours]); 2 × Freq at normal VT (<b>double</b> minute <b>ventilation</b> for 6 hours); and 2 × VT at normal Freq (<b>double</b> minute <b>ventilation</b> for 6 hours). Normocapnia was maintained throughout the experiment. At the biophysical level, gas exchange (alveolar-arterial O 2 -tension difference [AaDO 2]) deteriorated by 23, 51, and 95 %, and respiratory compliance decreased by 6. 0, 18. 4, and 26 % in the 1 × VT, 2 × Freq, and 2 × VT group, respectively, during 6 hours of ventilation. Concomitantly, at the biochemical-cellular level, interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid increased 44 -fold, 150 -fold, and 275 -fold (p = 0. 02), respectively. The white blood cell count decreased significantly in all three intervention groups. At the histological level, the influx of leukocytes as well as the tissue water content increased in proportion to the degree of injury. At the transcriptional level, lung IL- 8 mRNA expression increased 11 -fold in the 2 × VT group (p = 0. 002), 9 -fold (p = 0. 02) in the 2 × Freq group, and 4 -fold in the 1 × VT group as compared with control. Not only doubling VT, but also doubling Freq at normal VT injures the lung significantly, although to a lesser extent. A concept of weighted risk for increases of VT and Freq is proposed.

50|$|The doors must be {{at least}} as strong as the walls. The usual design is a trap-door, to {{minimize}} the size and expense. To reduce the weight, the door is normally constructed of steel, with a fitted steel lintel and frame. Very thick wood also serves, and is more resistant to heat because it chars rather than melts. If the door is on the surface and will be exposed to the blast wave, the edge of the door is normally counter-sunk in the frame so that the blast wave or a reflection cannot lift the edge. A bunker should have two doors. Door shafts may <b>double</b> as <b>ventilation</b> shafts to reduce digging.|$|R
40|$|Ventilation is {{the most}} {{important}} aspect for the climatization of greenhouses. Heat, moisture, and CO 2 are removed through ventilation. The effect of the dimensions of the ventilation windows and the orientation to the wind are investigated for a summer condition for a greenhouse design with a crop. Calculations are done using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The ventilation rate and the temperature distribution in the greenhouse are compared for the different ventilation openings. The influence of wind direction is determined at 5 m s- 1 windspeed together with the situation when no wind is present. The results show a large temperature gradient in the greenhouse. This gradient can be explained {{from the fact that the}} heat input is high causing a substantial temperature difference between the greenhouse air and the ambient. Ventilation increased as the window opening increased as expected. Opening only the window on the windward side resulted in almost <b>double</b> the <b>ventilation</b> than opening both the leeward and windward orientated windows. Side ventilation increases the ventilation especially when no wind is presen...|$|R
40|$|As {{building}} insulation level increases, the coupling of ventilation systems with building enveloppe airtightness becomes {{an important issue}} {{in order to improve}} buildings energy performances. A building ventilation model can be built on a set of resistances and generators in order to handle infiltration, natural ventilation as well as fan driven air flows. The model is able to assess the indoor air humidity level and the building energy balance. <b>Double</b> flow <b>ventilation</b> can be handled through decentralized air handling terminals (DAHT), integrated in window ledges. A model of DAHT can be combined with the model of a whole building envelope, including infiltrations as well as dynamic behaviour, allowing comparisons with classical ventilation systems, such as natural or hybrid systems, or with centralized double flow systems. Results regarding energy consumptions, air humidity levels and superficial condensation risks can be analysed. Fresh air flow can be calibrated in order to meet air quality standards related to indoor humidity level and CO 2 concentration. The modelization of buiding indoor hygro-thermal climate allows a complete assessment of the seasonal heat exchanger efficiency, including heat recovery through the condensation of indoor air humidity when it flows through the exchanger.

40|$|Abstract—Sustainable tall {{buildings}} that provide comfortable, healthy and efficient indoor environments are clearly desirable as the densification {{of living and}} working space for the world’s increasing population proceeds. For environmental concerns, these buildings must also be energy efficient. One component of these tasks is the provision of indoor air quality and thermal comfort, which can be enhanced with natural ventilation by the supply of fresh air. Working spaces can only be naturally ventilated with connections to the outdoors utilizing operable windows, <b>double</b> facades, <b>ventilation</b> stacks, balconies, patios, terraces and skygardens. Large amounts of fresh air can be provided to the indoor spaces without mechanical air-conditioning systems, which are widely employed in contemporary {{tall buildings}}. This paper tends to present the concept of natural ventilation for sustainable tall office buildings {{in order to achieve}} healthy and comfortable working spaces, as well as energy efficient environments. Initially the historical evolution of ventilation strategies for tall buildings is presented, beginning with natural ventilation and continuing with the introduction of mechanical air-conditioning systems. Then the emergence of natural ventilation due to the health and environmental concerns in tall buildings is handled, and the strategies for implementing this strategy are revealed. In the next section, a number of case studies that utilize this strategy are investigated. Finally, how tall office buildings can benefit from this strategy is discussed.

40|$|The study aims {{to inform}} {{designers}} about {{a method for}} assessing the likely energy consequences of decisions open to them regarding refurbishment options for high-rise housing in the UK. The TASÂ° thermal simulation computer program was used to predict the effects of various improvement measures for a first-floor and a tenth-floor flat. The performances of retrofitted thermal insulation, <b>double</b> glazing, <b>ventilation</b> control measures, and sunspaces were considered. A lifecycle costing method was used to indicate the energy and financial benefits of these improvement options. The results {{indicated that there was}} a difference of between 25 % and 60 % in the predicted heating loads of the first-floor and tenth-floor flats, depending on the improvements installed. Ventilation control measures were found to be the most effective in reducing heating loads and to have progressively greater significance the higher up the building the flat is located. Conversely, wall insulation measures were shown to be the least effective in view of the relatively high percentage of glazing within the external wall areas. The predictions indicated that the provision of sun-spaces could not be recommended solely on energy-thrift grounds, because of their high capital costs and low energy savings, but other improvements could be justified over the lifetime simply by taking account of the cost benefit of predicted energy savings. The interaction of the effects of various renovation measures was also considered. Surprisingly, several envelope-insulation measures installed together can save {{more than the sum of}} their individual savings; the reasons for this are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2001 Pulmonary {{blood flow}} {{distribution}} {{is affected by}} many factors, including gravity, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), lung volume and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). In the lateral posture, the effects of posture, bilateral PEEP, differential ventilation with unilateral PEEP and left lung atelectasis on regional ventilation (V̇A) and perfusion (Q̇) in the lateral decubitus posture were studied. Q̇ and V̇A were measured using 15 -mum i. v. injected and 1 -mum aerosolized fluorescent microspheres and analyzed in ∼ 1. 7 cm 3 lung volume pieces. Multiple linear regression {{analysis was used to}} evaluate 3 -dimensional spatial gradients of Q̇, V̇A, V̇A/Q̇ and regional PO 2 (PRO 2). In the left lateral decubitus (LLD) posture, a gravity-dependent vertical gradient in Q̇ was observed in conjunction with a reduced blood flow and PRO 2 to the dependent left lung. This observation was consistent with HPV occurring in the dependent left lung. Either a change from the LLD to the RLD posture or 10 cm H 2 O PEEP increased local V̇ A/Q̇ and PRO 2 in the left lung and minimized any role of hypoxia. Lung distortion caused by the mediastinum was a major factor that determines regional blood flow and ventilation. In this respect, the smaller left lung was the most susceptible to impaired gas exchange in the LLD posture. With 100 % O 2 ventilation, the A-aDO 2 observed with conventional <b>ventilation</b> <b>doubled</b> with differential <b>ventilation,</b> with no change in blood flow. Unilateral PEEP increased dependent left lung FRC with no change in either blood flow or A-aDO 2. Bilateral PEEP produced no change in A-aDO 2 with an increased dependent blood flow. Lower dependent blood flow and A-aDO 2 in the LLD posture during differential ventilation with unilateral dependent PEEP was not due primarily to airway closure, lung volume distortion or V̇A/Q̇ inequality. HPV in the atelectatic lung shifted flow to the ventilated lung. The increased flow in the ventilated lung ensured adequate gas exchange, compensating for the shunt contributed by the atelectatic lung. A-aDO 2 increased with left lung atelectasis and was exacerbated in the LLD posture by 10 cm H 2 O PEEP, a result of increased Q̇ to the atelectatic lung. This PEEP-induced O 2 deficit was eliminated with inversion to the RLD posture...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{important}} {{efforts are}} made to reduce the residential building energy consumption. In this context, a growing interest for heat recovery ventilation has been observed during the last decades. The present paper focuses on a new single room ventilation with heat recovery. <b>Double</b> flow <b>ventilation</b> is achieved through {{the integration of the}} unit into windows ledges. The developed device is particularly suitable compared to traditional centralized heat recovery ventilation units for retrofitted houses due to the absence of air extracting and air pulsing ducts through the house. The first part of the paper consists in describing the characteristics and properties of the developed device (volume, components, flow configuration, advantages and drawbacks). In {{the second part of the}} paper, an experimental approach is presented to characterize the unit. The criteria of performance are based on: - Thermal effectiveness of the unit (testing of a recovery heat exchanger), - Hydraulic aspects (flows delivered by the unit vs energy supplied to the unit), - Acoustic aspects. The overall performance of the unit can be established based on the experimental results described here above. Cartography of performance (ratio between the recovered heat and the supply electrical power) can be drawn, depending on the flow rates delivered by the unit and the indoor/outdoor temperature difference. The last part of the paper compares the new system with natural, simple exhaust ventilation and traditional centralized systems in terms of primary energy, consumer price and carbon dioxide emissions. Results show that the presented device seems more competitive than natural and simple exhaust ventilation for the Belgian climate. The single room ventilation investigated in this paper also shows better performance than most of the centralized ventilation systems tested on site...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a non-dimensional {{approach}} towards the description of interaction between the three respiratory stimuli of hypoxia, hypercapnia and exercise and to use this approach to quantify the relative strengths of their interactions. Only a part of the study related to the overall interaction of the three stimuli is presented here. Nine volunteers took part in the study and their ventilatory responses to hypoxia were measured under four different conditions of rest-eucapnia, rest-hypercapnia, exercise-eucapnia and exercise-hypercapnia. Non-dimensional linear functions of hypercapnia (x), hypoxia (y) and exercise (z) were defined such that a value of one would <b>double</b> the resting <b>ventilation.</b> Non-dimensional ventilation v was derived as: v(x,y,z) = 1 + x + y + z + g 1 xy + g 2 xz + g 3 yz + g 4 xyz, where g 1, g 2, g 3 and g 4 provide non-dimensional measures of the strength of stimulus interaction. These interactions were calculated from the parameters obtained by fitting simple respiratory models to the data. The values for g 1, g 3 and g 4 were significantly different from zero (p < 0. 05, t-test). An intriguing result of this study is the overall negative interaction of the three stimuli, which may suggest that the linear, stimulus-response models commonly used to describe respiratory data may not be adequate for describing these complex interactions...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Current {{building}} ventilation {{standards are}} based on acceptable minimums. Three decades of research demonstrates the human health benefits of increased ventilation above these minimums. Recent research also shows the benefits on human decision-making performance in office workers, which translates to increased productivity. However, adoption of enhanced ventilation strategies is lagging. We sought to evaluate two of the perceived potential barriers to more widespread adoption—Economic and environmental costs. Methods: We estimated the energy consumption and associated per building occupant costs for office buildings in seven U. S. cities, representing different climate zones for three ventilation scenarios (standard practice (20 cfm/person), 30 % enhanced ventilation, and 40 cfm/person) and four different heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system strategies (Variable Air Volume (VAV) with reheat and a Fan Coil Unit (FCU), both with and without an energy recovery ventilator). We also estimated {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} associated with this increased energy usage, and, for comparison, converted this to the equivalent number of vehicles using greenhouse gas equivalencies. Lastly, we paired results from our previous research on cognitive function and ventilation with labor statistics to estimate the economic benefit of increased productivity associated with increasing <b>ventilation</b> rates. Results: <b>Doubling</b> the <b>ventilation</b> rate from the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers minimum cost less than $ 40 per person per year in all climate zones investigated. Using an energy recovery ventilation system significantly reduced energy costs, and in some scenarios led to a net savings. At the highest ventilation rate, adding an ERV essentially neutralized the environmental impact of enhanced ventilation (0. 03 additional cars on the road per building across all cities). The same change in ventilation improved the performance of workers by 8 %, equivalent to a $ 6500 increase in employee productivity each year. Reduced absenteeism and improved health are also seen with enhanced ventilation. Conclusions: The health benefits associated with enhanced ventilation rates far exceed the per-person energy costs relative to salary costs. Environmental impacts can be mitigated at regional, building, and individual-level scales through the transition to renewable energy sources, adoption of energy efficient systems and ventilation strategies, and promotion of other sustainable policies...|$|R
40|$|The {{genioglossus}} (GG) {{is considered}} the principle protrudor muscle of the human tongue. Unlike most skeletal muscles, GG electromyographic (EMG) activities are robustly preserved in sleep and thus may fulfill {{a critical role in}} preserving airway patency. Previous studies in human subjects also confirm that the GG EMG increases in response to chemoreceptor and mechanoreceptor stimulation. This increase occurs secondary to the recruitment of previously inactive motor units (MUs) and/or an increase in firing rate of already active MUs. Which strategy the nervous system uses when the synaptic drive onto GG motoneurons increases is not known. Here we report on GG whole muscle and tonic MU activities under conditions that mimic sleep, i. e., mild-moderate elevations in CO 2 (3 % inspired CO 2 or the addition of a 1. 0 l dead space) and elevated airway resistance. Based on previous work in rat, we hypothesized that mild hypercapnia would increase the firing rates of tonic MUs and that these effects would be further potentiated by a modest increase in airway resistance. Fine wire and tungsten microelectrodes were inserted into the GG to record whole muscle and single MU activities in 21 subjects (13 women, 8 men; 20 – 55 yr). Either 3 % inspired CO 2 or added dead space resulted in a 200 – 300 % increase in the amplitude of both tonic and phasic components of the whole muscle GG EMG and a <b>doubling</b> of minute <b>ventilation.</b> Despite these changes, recordings obtained from a total of 84 tonically discharging GG single MUs provide no evidence of a change in firing rate under any of the conditions. On this basis we conclude that in healthy adults, the increase in the tonic component of the whole muscle GG EMG secondary to mild hypercapnia is due almost exclusively to the recruitment of previously inactive MUs...|$|R
