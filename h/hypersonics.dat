2500|$|The HFFAF has a {{test section}} {{equipped}} with 16 shadowgraph-imaging stations. Each station {{can be used}} to capture an orthogonal pair of images of a hypervelocity model in flight.

For very high Mach number (M > 25) simulations, models can be launched into a counter-flowing gas stream generated by the shock tube. The facility can also be configured for hypervelocity impact testing and has an aerothermodynamic capability as well.

While the paper is not a survey of all facilities, it covers the utility of shock tunnels and conventional <b>hypersonic</b> blow-down facilities which have been used for <b>hypersonic</b> air-breather studies. The problems confronting researchers in the field of aerothermodynamics are outlined. Results from the T 5 GALCIT tunnel for the shock-on lip problem are outlined. Experiments on combustors and short expansion nozzles using the semi-free jet method have been conducted in large shock tunnels.
