5|$|Another uneventful advance {{into the}} North Sea {{took place on}} 21–22 April. A {{bombardment}} mission followed two days later; Posen joined the battleship support for Hipper's battlecruisers while they attacked Yarmouth and Lowestoft on 24–25 April. During this operation, the battlecruiser Seydlitz was damaged by a British mine and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> port prematurely. Due to the poor visibility, the operation was soon called off, leaving the British fleet no time to intercept the raiders.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the French Revolutionary War, Gibraltar served in the Channel Fleet, {{fighting}} at the Glorious First of June in 1794 before being sent to the Mediterranean in May 1795. In June, the ship was in an action off Hyères; then, in December 1796, she was badly damaged in a storm and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> England for major repairs. By June Gibraltar was back in the Mediterranean, serving in the navy's Egyptian campaign, where she remained during and beyond the Peace of Amiens, except for a short period when she was sent home for a refit.|$|E

5|$|Bruix, {{named after}} Admiral Étienne Eustache Bruix, was laid {{down at the}} Arsenal de Rochefort on 9 November 1891. She was {{launched}} on 2 August 1894 and commissioned for trials on 15 April 1896. The ship was temporarily assigned to the Northern Squadron (Escadre du Nord) on 24 November for the visit of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and his wife to Dunkerque on 5–9 October. The ship's steering broke down on 7 October and she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Rochefort for repairs. Trials lasted until early December and Bruix was officially commissioned on 15 December and assigned to the Northern Squadron.|$|E
5|$|In summer 2002, Gascoigne went {{on trial}} with American club D.C. United, but {{rejected}} a contract. In February 2003, {{he signed a}} nine-month contract with China League One club Gansu Tianma in both a playing and coaching role. Gascoigne scored in his first match in China, and in total scored two goals in four league games but his mental state meant that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> America for treatment against drink and depression in April, and he never returned despite the club ordering him to do so.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that the long journey and the siege had a {{detrimental}} effect on the Sultan's health. His death meant that any advances were postponed as the Grand Vizier <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Constantinople for the succession of the new Sultan, Selim II. Even if Suleiman had lived his army could not have achieved much in the short time that remained between the fall of Szigeth and the onset of winter. The prolonged resistance at Szigeth delayed the Ottoman push to Vienna.|$|E

With other carriers, she {{took part in the}} Pearl Harbor raid in December 1941 and the invasion of Rabaul in the Southwest Pacific in January 1942. The following month her aircraft participated in a combined carrier airstrike on Darwin, Australia, helping secure the conquest of the Dutch East Indies by Japanese forces. She missed the Indian Ocean raid in April as she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Japan for permanent repairs after hitting a reef in February.|$|E
5|$|Knox {{knew that}} the Queen Regent would ask for help from France. So he {{negotiated}} by letter under the assumed name John Sinclair with William Cecil, Elizabeth's chief adviser, for English support. Knox sailed secretly to Lindisfarne, off the northeast coast of England {{at the end of}} July, to meet James Croft and Sir Henry Percy at Berwick upon Tweed. Knox was indiscreet and news of his mission soon reached Mary of Guise. He returned to Edinburgh telling Croft he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> his flock, and suggested that Henry Balnaves should go to Cecil.|$|E
5|$|Margot Robbie {{auditioned for}} the role of Donna in 2008. The actress {{believed}} that she had performed badly in the audition and decided to leave for a five-week snowboarding holiday in Canada. Robbie had been in Canada for two days when she received a phone call telling her that she had been successful and that she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Australia. Robbie began appearing on-screen in June of that year. Donna was originally supposed to have a guest character role, but Robbie was promoted to regular cast member shortly after her debut.|$|E

5|$|Richard of Bordeaux was {{the younger}} son of Edward, the Black Prince, and Joan of Kent. Edward, heir {{apparent}} {{to the throne}} of England, had distinguished himself as a military commander in the early phases of the Hundred Years' War, particularly in the Battle of Poitiers in 1356. After further military adventures, however, he contracted dysentery in Spain in 1370. He never fully recovered and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> England the next year.|$|E
5|$|What {{followed}} next is {{not entirely}} clear, but Heraclius certainly won a crushing victory over Shahrbaraz {{in the fall of}} 622. The key factor was Heraclius' discovery of Persian forces hidden in ambush and responding by feigning retreat during the battle. The Persians left their cover to chase the Byzantines, whereupon Heraclius' elite Optimatoi assaulted the pursuing Persians, causing them to flee. Thus he saved Anatolia from the Persians. Heraclius <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Constantinople, however, to deal with the threat posed to his Balkan domains by the Avars, so he left his army to winter in Pontus.|$|E
5|$|After Prussia {{expressed}} an interest in the ship, the Emperor of France, Napoleon III, bought her in April for 2.5 million dollars over the objections of his own navy, which preferred a home-built ship. The exact date of purchase is unknown, but Welles noted in his diary on 7 May that Webb had told him of the sale. On 27 June, Webb refunded the money that had been paid to him and also purchased those items furnished by the government. A little over a week later, he attempted to sail to France, but <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> port the following day due to engine problems. These were not resolved until 19 July when he, and his entire family, set sail. Dunderberg arrived at Cherbourg on 3 August and the French Navy took possession three days later.|$|E

She was able to visit Boyanus in Leningrad on two occasions, {{and he was able to}} briefly return to London in 1928. Boyanus was finally able to permanently move to England in January 1934, whereupon he became a lecturer in Russian and Phonetics at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies at the University of London. While working at University College, Armstrong lived in Forest Gate and Church End, Finchley.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond was {{compelled}} to surrender Antioch to Leo. He appointed his marshal, Bartholomew Tirel, to accompany the Armenian troops, which were {{under the command of}} Hethoum of Sason, to Antioch. The Antiochene noblemen allowed Leo's soldiers to enter the town, but the mainly Greek and Latin burgers opposed Leo's rule. An Armenian soldier's rude remark about Saint Hilary, to whom the royal chapel was dedicated, provoked a riot, forcing the Armenians to withdraw from the town. The burghers assembled in the cathedral to form a commune under the auspices of Patriarch Aimery. They declared Bohemond's eldest son, Raymond, regent for his imprisoned father. Raymond's younger brother, Bohemond, also hurried from Tripoli to Antioch, and the Armenian forces <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Cilicia.|$|E
5|$|By mid-August 1941, Empire Simba, with a {{completely}} new crew, had been repaired enough to set out in a Liverpool – Freetown convoy, but evidently returned to Liverpool the same day. After making her way to Oban on 9 September, she began the first of seven roundtrips to Freetown over the next 18 months, including convoy SL 125. Twice, when setting out with convoys, Empire Simba <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> port with unspecified problems. In a third convoy sailing, a problem with her steering gear caused her to collide with another convoy ship, Empire Scott, and on 1 August Empire Simba straggled and {{dropped out of the}} convoy.|$|E

The next operation conducted was a sweep into the North Sea on 11–12 September, though it ended without any action. Another sortie followed on 23–24 October during which the German fleet did not encounter any British forces. Another uneventful advance into the North Sea took place on 21–22 April 1916. A bombardment mission followed two days later; Westfalen joined the battleship support for Hipper's battlecruisers while they attacked Yarmouth and Lowestoft on 24–25 April.

5|$|Donna Freedman (also Brown) is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the Australian soap opera Neighbours, played by Margot Robbie.

5|$|During the Monmouth Rebellion in 1685, the Duke of Monmouth {{was welcomed}} {{when he passed}} through Shepton Mallet, staying in Longbridge House in Cowl Street {{on the night of}} 23 June, with his men {{quartered}} throughout the town, before setting out for Bristol the following day. Many Shepton men joined the cause, but Monmouth failed to take Bath or Bristol and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Shepton on 30 June. Following the Battle of Sedgemoor, the Duke fled and spent the night of 6 July at Downside, a mile north of Shepton, before continuing his flight for two more days before his capture. Following the Bloody Assizes, twelve local supporters of Monmouth were hanged and quartered in the Market Place of the town.|$|E
