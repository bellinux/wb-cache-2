5|$|Their feet {{have four}} long toes and an opposable big toe. Orangutans can grasp things with both {{their hands and}} their feet. Their <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> <b>toes</b> are curved, {{allowing}} them {{to get a better}} grip on branches. Since their hip joints have the same flexibility as their shoulder and arm joints, orangutans have less restriction in the movements of their legs than humans have. Unlike gorillas and chimpanzees, orangutans are not true knuckle-walkers, and are instead fist-walkers.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{study by}} Dr. Nguyen Viet Nhan, {{children}} in the areas where Agent Orange was used have been affected and have multiple health problems, including cleft palate, mental disabilities, hernias, and extra <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> <b>toes.</b> In the 1970s, high levels of dioxin were found in the breast milk of South Vietnamese women, and in the blood of U.S. military personnel who had served in Vietnam. The most affected zones are the mountainous area along Truong Son (Long Mountains) and the border between Vietnam and Cambodia. The affected residents are living in substandard conditions with many genetic diseases.|$|E

5|$|When {{warfarin}} (or another 4-hydroxycoumarin derivative) {{is given}} {{during the first}} trimester—particularly between the sixth and ninth weeks of pregnancy—a constellation of birth defects known variously as fetal warfarin syndrome (FWS), warfarin embryopathy, or coumarin embryopathy can occur. FWS is characterized mainly by skeletal abnormalities, which include nasal hypoplasia, a depressed or narrowed nasal bridge, scoliosis, and calcifications in the vertebral column, femur, and heel bone, which show a peculiar stippled appearance on X-rays. Limb abnormalities, such as brachydactyly (unusually short <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> <b>toes)</b> or underdeveloped extremities, can also occur. Common nonskeletal features of FWS include low birth weight and developmental disabilities.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{it appears}} that Iguanodon became more quadrupedal as it got older and heavier; {{juvenile}} I. bernissartensis have shorter arms than adults (60% of hindlimb length versus 70% for adults). When walking as a quadruped, the animal's hands would have been held so that the palms faced each other, as shown by iguanodontian trackways and the anatomy of this genus's arms and hands. The three toed pes (foot) of Iguanodon was relatively long, and when walking, both the hand and the foot would {{have been used in}} a digitigrade fashion (walking on the <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> <b>toes).</b> The maximum speed of Iguanodon has been estimated at , which would have been as a biped; {{it would not have been}} able to gallop as a quadruped.|$|E
5|$|Several {{anomalies}} {{affecting the}} digits (<b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> <b>toes)</b> {{have been observed}} with the syndrome. A broadening of the thumbs and big toes (halluces) was reported in two brothers. The broadening was apparent in all distal phalanges of the fingers, although the pinkies were unaffected yet appeared to be clinodactylic (warped, or bent toward the other fingers). Additional eports described this broadness of the thumbs and big toes, with brachydactyly (shortness) in the distal phalanges of the other digits except the pinkies in affected individuals. On X-rays of a two-year-old boy with the disorder, the brachydactyly was shown {{to be caused by}} shortening of epiphyses (joint-ends) of the distal phalanges. The broadness and brachydactyly of the big toes in particular may give them a stunted, rounded and stub-like appearance.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{observe the}} effects of bloodletting {{puncture}} at Jing-Well points in the distal ends of the <b>finger</b> <b>and</b> <b>toe</b> on survival rate, survival time, and brain edema in rats with cerebral ischemia. MethodsFifty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups: normal, sham operation, model, bloodletting puncture at Jing-Well points in distal ends of <b>finger</b> <b>and</b> <b>toe,</b> <b>and</b> puncture without bloodletting at these points. Middle cerebral artery occlusion models were established according to Longa's method. The brains were taken 48 h after the model was established. Brain water content, brain density, brain coefficient, survival rate, and survival time in each group were measured. ResultsAfter bloodletting puncture, the survival time of the rats was prolonged, their brain water content and brain coefficient were reduced, and brain density was increased. ConclusionBloodletting puncture at Jing-Well points in the distal ends of the <b>finger</b> <b>and</b> <b>toe</b> can improve function in ischemic brain edema...|$|R
25|$|Children often face medical issues very {{different}} from the experiences of an adult patient. Many birth defects or syndromes present at birth are best treated in childhood, and pediatric plastic surgeons specialize in treating these conditions in children. Conditions commonly treated by pediatric plastic surgeons include craniofacial anomalies, Syndactyly (webbing of the <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> <b>toes),</b> Polydactyly (excess <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> <b>toes</b> at birth), cleft lip and palate, and congenital hand deformities.|$|E

25|$|It is {{generally}} {{safe to use}} lidocaine with vasoconstrictor such as epinephrine including in regions such as the nose, ears, <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> <b>toes.</b> While concerns of tissue death if used in these areas have been raised evidence does not support these concerns.|$|E
25|$|The {{commonly}} held belief that LA with vasoconstrictor can cause necrosis in extremities {{such as the}} nose, ears, <b>fingers,</b> <b>and</b> <b>toes</b> due to constriction of end arteries], is invalidated, since no case of necrosis has been reported since the introduction of commercial lidocaine with epinephrine in 1948.|$|E
25|$|A nail is a horn-like {{envelope}} {{covering the}} tips of the <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> <b>toes</b> in most primates and a few other mammals. Nails are similar to claws in other animals. Fingernails and toenails are made of a tough protective protein called alpha-keratin. This protein is also found in the hooves and horns of different animals.|$|E

25|$|The dry {{gangrene}} is {{a result}} of vasoconstriction induced by the ergotamine-ergocristine alkaloids of the fungus. It affects the more poorly vascularized distal structures, such as the <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> <b>toes.</b> Symptoms include desquamation or peeling, weak peripheral pulses, loss of peripheral sensation, edema and ultimately the death and loss of affected tissues. Vasoconstriction is treated with vasodilators.|$|E
25|$|Counting aids, {{especially}} {{the use of}} body parts (counting on fingers), were certainly used in prehistoric times as today. There are many variations. Besides counting ten fingers, some cultures have counted knuckles, the space between <b>fingers,</b> <b>and</b> <b>toes</b> as well as fingers. The Oksapmin culture of New Guinea uses a system of 27 upper body locations to represent numbers.|$|E
25|$|Nut is {{also the}} barrier {{separating}} the forces of chaos from the ordered cosmos in the world. She was pictured as a woman arched on her toes and fingertips over the earth; her body portrayed as a star-filled sky.

The <b>finger</b> <b>and</b> <b>toe</b> discs are present but small. The tympanum is relatively large and distinct in most species.|$|R
60|$|These {{children}} grew up, {{and when}} they came to adult years, they all married, and of course it happened that they all married five-fingered and five-toed persons. Now let us see what were the results. Salvator had four children; they were two boys, a girl, and another boy; the first two boys and the girl were six-fingered and six-toed like their grandfather; the fourth boy had only five <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> five <b>toes.</b> George had only four children; there were two girls with six <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> six toes; there was one girl with six <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> five <b>toes</b> on the right side, <b>and</b> five <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> five <b>toes</b> on the left side, so that she was half and half. The last, a boy, had five <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> five <b>toes.</b> The third, Andre, you will recollect, was perfectly well-formed, and he had many children whose hands and feet were all regularly developed. Marie, the last, who, of course, married a man who had only five fingers, had four children; the first, a boy, was born with six toes, but the other three were normal.|$|R
25|$|In most people, {{the trails}} of the {{burrowing}} mites are linear or S-shaped {{tracks in the}} skin often accompanied by rows of small, pimple-like mosquito or insect bites.

25|$|Prolonged GH excess thickens {{the bones}} of the jaw, <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> <b>toes.</b> Resulting {{heaviness}} of the jaw and increased size of digits is referred to as acromegaly. Accompanying problems can include sweating, pressure on nerves (e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome), muscle weakness, excess sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), insulin resistance or even a rare form of type 2 diabetes, and reduced sexual function.|$|E
25|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) is {{a genetic}} disorder that affects mostly the lungs, {{but also the}} pancreas, liver, kidneys, and intestine. Long-term issues include difficulty breathing and coughing up mucus {{as a result of}} frequent lung infections. Other signs and symptoms may include sinus infections, poor growth, fatty stool, clubbing of the <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> <b>toes,</b> and infertility in some males. Different people may have different degrees of symptoms.|$|E
50|$|The holotype is {{an adult}} female with half-developed ova, {{measuring}} 17.4 mm in snout-urostyle length. The snout is rounded truncate in dorsal view but projecting in profile.

40|$|Two {{new species}} of microhylid frogs {{assigned}} to the genus Callulops are described from the mountains of New Guinea. Callulops fojaensis sp. nov. is known only from mid-montane forest in the Foja Mountains of Papua Province, Indonesian New Guinea, and can be distinguished from congeners by the combination of moderate size, short limbs, slightly expanded <b>finger</b> <b>and</b> <b>toe</b> discs, <b>and</b> uniform brown dorsal and lateral colouration. Callulops mediodiscus sp. nov. is known from a single site in mid-montane forest in Southern Highlands Province, Papua New Guinea, and can be distinguished from all congeners by its wide <b>finger</b> <b>and</b> <b>toe</b> discs, moderate size and short advertisement call. Description of these two new frog species brings the number of Callulops known to 18, of which at least nine are only known from montane regions (> 1000 m above sea level).
