5|$|OTA began filing {{condemnation}} {{suits for}} homes within the Creek Turnpike's proposed right-of-way on June 30, 1989. Condemnation, {{the process by}} which a government exercises its powers of eminent domain, was required for OTA to seize properties necessary for the project when owners refused OTA buyout offers. Bids were opened for Creek Turnpike construction projects that November. Contracts for utility relocation, grading, and <b>drainage</b> <b>work</b> were awarded at OTA's November 16 meeting. Meanwhile, work began on the condemned properties, with contractors moving or demolishing houses on the affected lots from December 1989 to January 1990.|$|E
5|$|The low-lying swampy area of Westhay Moor has had peat {{laid down}} over older rocks {{for the last}} 10,000 years. The Neolithic people lived on the areas of {{slightly}} higher ground but exploited the reed beds for materials and built wooden trackways to cross the raised bog. Peat extraction on the Somerset Levels has occurred since the area was first drained by the Romans. Measures to improve the drainage were {{carried out in the}} Middle Ages largely by Glastonbury Abbey. In the 17th and 18th centuries further <b>drainage</b> <b>work</b> was undertaken including digging a series of rhynes, or ditches and larger drainage canals. Peat extraction peaked in the 1960s but has since declined.|$|E

25|$|For {{many generations}} {{the main source}} of {{employment}} in the parish was agriculture. The village lands were divided into two parts—infield and outfield. The infield was cultivated for the growing of crops and the outfield was pasture. Crops grown included wheat, barley and peas. Turnips were a successful later addition. The scrubland and clay soil of the parish meant lots of hard work re-claiming land, <b>drainage</b> <b>work,</b> and liming. Wheat and barley were taken by cart to Dalkeith, Peebles and Melrose for the making of bread and beer, and carts returning from Dalkeith brought lime for the soil.|$|E
25|$|A ribbon {{either side}} of the route from Spalding to Sutton Bridge was {{populated}} in Roman times, and was again evident in the Domesday Book. Enclosing and reclamation of the salt marsh to the north of this area took place from the seventeenth century, and drainage was overseen by the Court of Sewers. In 1793, the South Holland Drainage District was set up by Act of Parliament, and carried out extensive <b>drainage</b> <b>work,</b> but the schemes were hampered by the state of the River Nene outfall. This was replaced in 1832, and allowed the district to lower their own sluice in 1852, to provide better gravity discharge. The need to grow more food during and after the Second World War resulted in large areas of grassland being ploughed up for agriculture, and the drains were made deeper and wider to improve the soil conditions. The main outfall sluice was again rebuilt in 1937, and its construction involved the first use of well point dewatering equipment in England.|$|E
25|$|The {{passing of}} the Land Drainage Act 1930 held promise for the future. The many bodies {{responsible}} for small parts of Somerset's flood defences were swept away, and replaced by the Somerset Catchment Board. More importantly, perhaps, {{they did not have}} to prove that benefits would occur to a particular community in order to issue rates for <b>drainage</b> <b>work,</b> but could raise rates based on the rateable values of properties. This should have worked, but they soon became apprehensive, and reverted to producing reports, which were not actioned. However, inactivity gave way to action in 1939, when a new engineer was appointed, who saw it as his job to direct what needed to be done. Work began on improvements to the King's Sedgemoor Drain in 1939. The items to be addressed were the size of the channel, the size of the bridges, and the size of Dunball clyse, all of which were too small. The onset of the Second World War, just a few months later, threatened to stop the scheme, but did not.|$|E

The project, which took eleven years to complete and employed 30,000 men, included the leveling of a hill top and the construction of a [...] tunnel between the lake and the river Liri (Lat. Liris).

Meare Pool had disappeared from maps by 1749. The Meare Pool originally collected the waters of the rivers Brue and Sheppey, and discharged in a northerly direction into the Lower River Axe. In the later years of the 12th century the Abbey diverted the Brue to flow westwards, perhaps largely through natural channels, from Meare Pool to join the river Parrett.|$|E
500|$|<b>Drainage</b> <b>work</b> was in {{progress}} by late February 1990. Construction was underway on turnpike bridges by March 1990. While federal environmental permits were being secured, the construction process was delayed; by October 1990, the bridge construction was {{only at the}} point that had been planned to have been completed in May, and grading and paving work had yet to begin. In December 1990, contractors on the Creek Turnpike project were given [...] "notice to proceed", as the permits had been granted. By that time, construction had only progressed {{to the point that}} it was supposed to have been at in late July. Nevertheless, by April 1991, OTA's chief executive officer, Richard Ridings, described the project as [...] "moving very well" [...] and said [...] "My own personal opinion is it's up to the contractors.

500|$|Early <b>drainage</b> <b>work</b> on the Somerset Levels {{was carried}} out in the later years of the 12th century, with the {{responsibility}} for maintaining all the watercourses between Glastonbury and the sea being placed on named individuals among whom were Ralph de Sancta Barbara of Brentmarsh. In 1129, the abbot of Glastonbury was recorded as inspecting enclosed land at Lympsham. Efforts to control flooding on the Parrett were recorded around the same date. In 1234, [...] were reclaimed near Westonzoyland and, from the accounts in the abbey's rent books, this had increased to [...] by 1240. In the 14th century a Fish House was built at Meare for the chief fisherman of the abbot of Glastonbury that was also used for salting and preparing fish. It is the only surviving monastic fishery building in England. At the time of the Dissolution in 1540, Meare Pool was said to contain a great abundance of pike, tench, roach and eels. In 1638, it was owned by William Freake, who described it as [...] "lately a fish pool". The importance of this industry is illustrated by a series of acrimonious disputes between Glastonbury and the Dean and Chapter of Wells Cathedral. The abbey required fish on Fridays, fast days and during Lent. As many as 5000 eels were landed in a typical year.|$|E
500|$|The fish ponds {{surrounding}} the Fish House {{were recorded in}} the Domesday Book of 1086 when they were tended by ten fishermen. The fishponds, which were connected with drains and gullies were up to [...] long and [...] wide. These were connected to the Meare Pool and [...] the River Brue. At one point 5,000 eels were caught each year. Pike, Bream and [...] "white fish" [...] were also caught. [...] Meare Pool was formed by water ponding-up behind the raised peat bogs between the Wedmore and the Polden Hills, and coring has shown that {{it is filled with}} at least [...] of detritus mud, especially in the Subatlantic climatic period (1st millennium BC). Early <b>drainage</b> <b>work</b> was carried out in the later years of the 12th century, with the responsibility for maintaining all the watercourses between Glastonbury and the sea being placed on named individuals among whom were Ralph de Sancta Barbara of Brentmarsh. Its precise boundaries varied according to season, and, over the longer term, as efforts were made to drain the area. The south end was bordered by the high ground that the village of Meare is built upon. The pond would have extended no further west than the current Westhay to Wedmore road, where a shelf of rock formed a natural boundary. To the north lies the Godney ridge. The eastern extent is harder to determine, and it may have gone as far as the site of the Glastonbury Lake Village.

2500|$|Until the 17th century, {{the river}} flowed northwards {{from a place}} which {{subsequently}} became known as 'Idle Stop', across Hatfield Chase. To the west of Wroot, the River Torne formed two channels, both of which joined the Idle {{to the east of}} Wroot, and the Idle continued to join the River Don to the north west of Sandtoft. From Dirtness, the Don flowed to the north east, to Adlingfleet, where it joined the River Trent near to its confluence with the River Ouse. However, in 1626 the Dutch drainage engineer Cornelius Vermuyden was appointed by King Charles I to drain Hatfield Chase. Vermuyden brought over a number of Walloon partners, known as the Participants, who took shares and performed the <b>drainage</b> <b>work,</b> which was completed two years later. The Idle was affected by this work. Its course was blocked by a dam constructed at Idle Stop, and its waters were diverted along the Bycarrs Dyke, a Roman navigation channel, which joined the River Trent at West Stockwith. In order to isolate the river from Hatfield Chase, a barrier bank was constructed along the northern edge of this channel, for [...] from the dam to Stockwith. A navigable sluice was built about [...] from the river mouth at Misterton Soss by Vermuyden's nephew, John Liens, between 1629 and 1630, to prevent water from the Trent flooding the land to the south of Bycarrs Dike. The construction was of timber, with high banks running to the Trent {{on both sides of the}} channel. Lifting gates gave access to a lock chamber , which could be used when the Trent was not in flood. Liens was compelled to carry out the work by the Court of Sewers, to prevent the flooding of Misterton and Haxey Commons.|$|E
