2500|$|The Malagasy or striped civet (<b>Fossa</b> <b>fossana),</b> {{also known}} as the fanaloka (Malagasy, [...] ) or jabady, is an euplerid endemic to Madagascar.|$|R
50|$|Also {{seen in the}} Anjajavy Forest area is the {{endangered}} Fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox), the largest mammalian carnivore in Madagascar. Other nocturnal mammals occur in the forest here, like two species of tenrecs: greater hedgehog (Setifer setosus) and (Tenrec ecaudatusalso) and the elusive Malagasy civet (<b>Fossa</b> <b>fossana).</b>|$|R
50|$|Recent {{molecular}} {{studies indicate}} that the 10 living species of Madagascar carnivorans evolved from one ancestor that {{is thought to have}} rafted over from mainland Africa 18-24 million years ago. This makes Malagasy carnivorans a clade. They are closely allied with the true herpestid mongooses, their closest living relatives. The fossa and the Malagasy civet (<b>Fossa</b> <b>fossana)</b> are believed to be the most ancient surviving species within this group.|$|R
50|$|Within {{the family}} Eupleridae, some {{relations}} remain unclear, with evidence from several genes {{and methods of}} inference providing conflicting evidence as to the relations among Galidiinae, the fossa, and the Malagasy civet (<b>Fossa</b> <b>fossana).</b> Molecular evidence suggests that Galidia was the earliest to diverge of the four galidiine genera and that Mungotictis and Salanoia are each other's closest relatives. Morphological evidence, on the other hand, supports the relation between Mungotictis and Salanoia, but suggests that Galidictis was the earliest lineage to diverge.|$|R
50|$|Eupleridae: Primary {{among these}} {{malagasy}} carnivores is the fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox), {{a type of}} civet despite its feline appearance. Other Malagasy carnivores include the fanaloka (<b>Fossa</b> <b>fossana),</b> which, despite its scientific name, {{should not be confused}} with the fossa. Nor should it be confused with the very similarly named falanouc (Eupleres goudotii), also known as the Malagasy small-toothed civet. Five species of mongoose are also found in Madagascar, as is the small Indian civet, one of the carnivores believed to have been introduced to the island.|$|R
50|$|Mammals {{found in}} this forest include the apex {{predator}} fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox), the fanaloka (<b>Fossa</b> <b>fossana),</b> northern ring-tailed mongoose and numerous bat species. Lemurs occurring here include the crowned lemur, northern sportive lemur, gray mouse lemur, Sanford's brown lemur and the aye-aye. Numerous geckos inhabit the reserve including the Henkel's leaf-tailed gecko, big-headed gecko and day gecko. Other local reptiles are the Madagascar ground boa, the white-lipped chameleon (Furcifer minor) and Oustalet's chameleon, the world's largest chameleon, which can attain 68 centimetres in length.|$|R
50|$|Euplerinae, more {{commonly}} known as malagasy civets, is a subfamily of carnivorans that includes four species restricted to Madagascar. Together with the subfamily Galidiinae, which also only occurs on Madagascar, it forms the family Eupleridae. Members of this subfamily, which include the fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox), falanoucs (Eupleres goudotii and Eupleres major) and Malagasy civet (<b>Fossa</b> <b>fossana),</b> were placed in families like Felidae and Viverridae before genetic data indicated their consanguinity with other Madagascar carnivorans. Within the subfamily, the falanouc and Malagasy civet are {{more closely related to}} each other than to the fossa.|$|R
50|$|Of the twenty-five {{species of}} mammals in the park, {{endemics}} include eight species of lemur, the ring-tailed mongoose (Galidia elegans) and the Malagasy civet (<b>Fossa</b> <b>fossana).</b> Thirty-five of the seventy-five {{species of birds}} are endemic including the Amber Mountain rock thrush (Monticola sharpei erythronotus) which is only known from one area on the Amber Mountain massif. The park is also known for its amphibians and reptiles such as the Amber Mountain leaf chameleon (Brookesia ambreensis), {{which is one of}} the smallest reptiles in the world. There are thirty-five species of frog.|$|R
50|$|The {{reserve is}} mainly covered by dense {{deciduous}} dry forest {{and is the}} last place for the critically endangered lemur, Perrier's sifaka (Propithecus perrieri). There are five other species of lemurs found on the reserve. Four {{have been given the}} conservation status of endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and one, the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer) is a vulnerable species. The four endangered species are the aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), Indri (Indri indri), Diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema) and the black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata variegata). Two carnivores the Malagasy or striped civet (<b>Fossa</b> <b>fossana)</b> and the <b>fossa</b> (Cryptoprocta ferox) are also vulnerable species. The above mammals are all endemic to Madagascar.|$|R
5|$|The fossa was {{formally}} described by Edward Turner Bennett {{on the basis}} of a specimen from Madagascar sent by Charles Telfair in 1833. The common name is the same as the generic name of the Malagasy civet (<b>Fossa</b> <b>fossana),</b> but they are different species. Because of shared physical traits with civets, mongooses, and cats (Felidae), its classification has been controversial. Bennett originally placed the fossa as a type of civet in the family Viverridae, a classification that long remained popular among taxonomists. Its compact braincase, large eye sockets, retractable claws, and specialized carnivorous dentition have also led some taxonomists to associate it with the felids. In 1939, William King Gregory and Milo Hellman placed the fossa in its own subfamily within Felidae, the Cryptoproctinae. George Gaylord Simpson placed it back in Viverridae in 1945, still within its own subfamily, yet conceded it had many cat-like characteristics.|$|R
40|$|The wide-ranging, cumulative, {{negative}} effects of anthropogenic disturbance, including habitat degradation, exotic species, and hunting, on native wildlife {{has been well documented}} across a range of habitats worldwide with carnivores potentially being the most vulnerable due to their more extinction prone characteristics. Investigating the effects of anthropogenic pressures on sympatric carnivores is needed to improve our ability to develop targeted, effective management plans for carnivore conservation worldwide. Utilizing photographic, line-transect, and habitat sampling, as well as landscape analyses and village-based bushmeat hunting surveys, we provide the first investigation of how multiple forms of habitat degradation (fragmentation, exotic carnivores, human encroachment, and hunting) affect carnivore occupancy across Madagascar's largest protected area: the Masoala-Makira landscape. We found that as degradation increased, native carnivore occupancy and encounter rates decreased while exotic carnivore occupancy and encounter rates increased. Feral cats (Felis species) and domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) had higher occupancy than half of the native carnivore species across Madagascar's largest protected landscape. Bird and small mammal encounter rates were negatively associated with exotic carnivore occupancy, but positively associated with the occupancy of four native carnivore species. Spotted fanaloka (<b>Fossa</b> <b>fossana)</b> occupancy was constrained by the presence of exotic feral cats and exotic small Indian civet (Viverricula indica). Hunting was intense across the four study sites where hunting was studied, with the highest rates for the small Indian civet (mean= 90 individuals consumed/year), the ring-tailed vontsira (Galidia elegans) (mean= 58 consumed/year), and the fosa (Cryptoprocta ferox) (mean= 31 consumed/year). Our modeling results suggest hunters target intact forest where carnivore occupancy, abundance, and species richness, are highest. These various anthropogenic pressures and their effects on carnivore populations, especially increases in exotic carnivores and hunting, have wide-ranging, global implications and demand effective management plans to target the influx of exotic carnivores and unsustainable hunting that is affecting carnivore populations across Madagascar and worldwide...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{significant}} {{efforts to}} understand and conserve Madagascar&#x 2019;s unique biodiversity, relatively {{little is known about}} the island&#x 2019;s carnivore populations. We sampled four rainforest sites to explore the effects of forest logging and fragmentation on carnivore species richness and the density of the two largest endemic carnivores, the Fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox) and Malagasy Civet (<b>Fossa</b> <b>fossana).</b> Our rainforest sites were selected across a gradient of increasing anthropogenic disturbance from primary to selectively-logged to fragmented forest &#x 3 c; 2. 5 km from primary forest, to fragmented forest &#x 3 e; 20 km from primary forest. We deployed a minimum of 26 passive infrared camera stations at each forest site to non-invasively sample carnivores. By identifying C. ferox and F. fossana individuals based on unique pelage patterns, we were able to apply capture-recapture analyses using the Huggins model in Program MARK and Program DENSITY. We used a buffer of full mean-maximum-distance-moved (MMDM) and a spatially-explicit capture-recapture (SECR) method to estimate density. A total of 5, 579 camera-trap nights yielded detections of five endemic carnivores (C. ferox, F. fossana, ring-tailed mongoose Galidia elegans, broad-striped mongoose Galidictus fasciata, small-toothed civet Eupleres goudotii). We found variation in carnivore species richness among the four sites. All endemic carnivores were present in the primary and selectively-logged rainforest, while overall endemic species richness was greatly reduced in the fragmented forests. Density also varied significantly among the rainforest sites. F. fossana density (individuals/km- 2 1; SE) decreased significantly between the primary rainforest (SECR 3. 19 1; 0. 55, MMDM 2. 47 1; 0. 13) and selectively-logged rainforest (SECR 1. 38 1; 0. 223, MMDM 1. 22 1; 0. 055). F. fossana was absent from both fragmented sites. C. ferox density also decreased significantly between the primary rainforest (SECR 0. 12 1; 0. 05, MMDM 0. 14 1; 0. 001) and the selectively-logged rainforest (SECR 0. 09 1; 0. 04, MMDM 0. 09 1; 0. 002). C. ferox was absent from the fragmented rainforest &#x 3 e; 20 km from primary forest, yet we did detect a single individual at the fragmented rainforest &#x 3 c; 2. 5 km from the primary forest. Our results suggest that forest logging and fragmentation negatively impact C. ferox and F. fossana populations in Malagasy rainforests. Unlike F. fossana, C. ferox appears to be able to occupy rainforest fragments near primary forest. Our study provides the first assessment of carnivore population parameters in the eastern rainforests of Madagascar and will be of importance to Malagasy governmental and non-governmental agencies seeking to more accurately assess the status of these species and to best set management goals...|$|R
