25|$|The Dutch Safety Board {{stated that}} the {{approach}} was not stabilized so the crew should have initiated a go around. The autopilot followed the <b>glide</b> <b>slope</b> while the autothrottle reduced thrust to idle due to a faulty radio altimeter showing an incorrect height. This caused the airspeed to drop and the pitch attitude to increase all unnoticed by the crew until the stick shaker activated. Prior to this, air traffic control caused the crew to intercept the <b>glide</b> <b>slope</b> from above and this obscured the erroneous autothrottle mode and increased the crew’s workload. The subsequent approach to stall recovery procedure was not executed properly, causing the aircraft to stall and crash.|$|E

Approaches with 4 -deg <b>glide</b> <b>slopes</b> were approximately 4. 0 EPNdB quieter than approaches with standard 3 -deg <b>glide</b> <b>slopes.</b> Noise reductions for low-drag 3 -deg approaches varied widely among the airplanes tested; the fleet-weighted reduction was 8. 5 EPNdB. Two-segment approaches resulted in noise reductions of 7. 0 EPNdB to 8. 5 EPNdB 3 nautical miles and 5 nautical miles from touchdown.

25|$|The {{plane was}} {{descending}} {{and followed the}} approved glide path. At this point the plane was on final approach and began descent on the glide path. Flaps then retracted to 5, which was actually incorrect as the flaps should be at 30. Suddenly, the plane encountered an increasing downdraft (in other word; microburst), as it continued the approach. The pitch angle increased as it encountered the descending air mass. Computed airspeed decreased significantly as the autopilot tried to maintain the <b>glide</b> <b>slope</b> beam.|$|E
25|$|The board {{determined}} the following Probable Cause for the accident:...the {{failure of the}} flightcrew to monitor altitude and to recognize passage of the aircraft through the approach decision height during an unstabilized precision approach conducted in rapidly changing meteorological conditions. The unstabilized nature of the approach was due initially to the aircraft's passing the outer marker above the <b>glide</b> <b>slope</b> at an excessive airspeed and thereafter compounded by the flightcrew's preoccupation with the questionable information presented by the flight director system. The poor positioning of the flight for the approach was in part the result of nonstandard air traffic control services.|$|E
25|$|On 31 July 1983, C-5A 70-0446 {{crashed on}} landing at Shemya, Alaska. The C-5 {{approached}} below the <b>glide</b> <b>slope,</b> hit an embankment {{short of the}} runway and bounced back into the air before coming {{to rest on the}} runway. Structural damage was extensive and the two aft main landing gear bogies were sheared from the aircraft. There were no fatalities. A joint USAF/Lockheed team made repairs enabling a one-time ferry flight from Shemya to the Lockheed plant in Marietta, Georgia. There, the aircraft was quickly christened Phoenix II and permanent repair efforts got under way. In addition to the structural repairs, Phoenix II also received an improved landing gear system (common to the then-new C-5B), wing modification, and a color weather radar upgrade. The aircraft was returned to service.|$|E

25|$|As a result, a study {{into the}} risks of bird strikes at KSIA was commissioned, with special {{attention}} being paid to the barn swallows at Mount Moreland. The study showed that the early morning dispersals of swallows generally happen before any scheduled arrivals or departures (earlier than 06:00), and the late afternoon swarms take place below the airport approach path, with only 5% of the birds protruding up into the path for {{a very short time}} (around 10 minutes). It was also noted that larger bird species, flying at higher altitudes, would pose more of a risk to aircraft than the swallows, such species already being a risk at Durban International Airport. The study concluded that it would definitely be possible for the airport and swallows to co-exist. Proposed risk mitigation measures included curtailing flight movements during the afternoon swarm, setting the <b>glide</b> <b>slope</b> approach to Runway 06 to 3.2 or 3.5 degrees rather than the standard 3 degrees (to stay above the birds), and the installation of a radar system that would monitor bird movements and be integrated into the operational plan of the airport.|$|E
25|$|Most {{aircraft}} arriving into Manchester Airport use the Instrument Landing System, {{which in}} line with most other airports has a <b>glide</b> <b>slope</b> of 3 degrees equal to descending 318 feet per nautical mile. The prevailing wind direction is westerly, so normally aircraft fly from northeast to southwest. In practice this means that normally aircraft land from the northeast over Stockport, Cheadle and Heald Green and takeoff towards Knutsford. In dual runway operations aircraft will usually land on to Runway 1 (23R) and depart from Runway 2 (23L). When the wind direction changes, usually affecting 20% of movements per annum, operations are reversed with aircraft landing from the southwest, lining up to the south over Northwich and over Knutsford and taking off towards Stockport. In dual runway operations aircraft will usually land on to Runway 2 (05R) and depart from Runway 1 (05L). Sometimes, aircraft arriving into Manchester Airport are held in stacks, usually in poor weather when the movement rate decreases. The airport has 3 stacks: DAYNE, MIRSI and ROSUN, each located approximately 15/20 miles from the airport. DAYNE serves arrivals from the south, ROSUN {{from the north and}} east and MIRSI from the west. If you live within 20 miles of the airport, you will likely see and hear aircraft.|$|E

40|$|Efficiently {{profiling}} {{the water}} column to achieve both high vertical and horizontal resolution from a moving vessel in deep water is difficult. Current solutions, such as CTD tow-yos, moving vessel profilers, and undulating tow bodies, are limited by ship speed or water depth.

Scale model tests show a wide range of achievable profiling <b>glide</b> <b>slopes</b> for tow cable angles between vertical and 45 °, and effective isolation of cable strum vibration from the towed vehicle body.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental results}} regarding {{the timing of}} the landing flare initiation by airline pilots. From previous research it was hypothesized that pilots use the visual cue theta-dot [...] which denotes the speed of apparent rotation of the runway side lines [...] to decide the proper time to commence the flare. Experiments were carried out in a Boeing 767 - 300 full flight training simulator, with one Captain and one Junior pilot. Approaches were flown under calm, head, cross- and tail wind conditions, resulting in a variety of approach sink rates, without the demerit of `unnatural'visual cues as would be the case with varying <b>glide</b> <b>slopes</b> as usually done in such experiments. Both the proposed theta-dot cue and several other cues suggested in literature are analyzed. Results show significant differences between the pilots with respect to the flare, while the main parameters during glide and at touch down did not. Data of the captain pilot seems to support our hypothesis, although the relatively small sample size and some outliers make it difficult to draw hard conclusions. No clear flare initiation cue could be identified the junior pilot, and his control throughout the flare is less sophisticated as well.

40|$|Profiling {{the water}} column from a moving vessel places {{significant}} limitations on the achievable spatial resolution of the data collected. Current solutions such as underway CTDs and undulating towed bodies are limited by vessel speed and operational water depths. With an increased focus on submesoscale processes (e. g., stirring, mixing, regulation of thermocline structure, chemical distributions along isopycnals and resolution of hydrothermal plumes), {{there is a growing}} need to collect profiles with high vertical and horizontal resolution. A new autonomous profiling vehicle has been developed to address this need. The autonomous wire flying profiling vehicle slides up and down a towed wire in controlled manner using the lift generated from actuated wing foils. Using a depth and velocity controller, the vehicle is capable of maintaining prescribed flight paths over a range of ship speeds and tow depths. The vehicle has achieved <b>glide</b> <b>slopes</b> (ratio of vertical to horizontal speeds) up to 2. 5 for tow cables angles between vertical and 45 degrees during field testing.
