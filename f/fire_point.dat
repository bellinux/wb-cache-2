25|$|Shusha was {{the main}} <b>fire</b> <b>point</b> from where Stepanakert was assaulted. Once the region's Communist Party {{headquarters}} and largest city {{with a population of}} 70,000, the fighting and shelling had driven away nearly 20,000 of Stepanakert's residents and forced the remainder to live underground in basements. By one tally recorded in early April, a total of 157 rockets had landed on the city in a single day. By early 1992 the bombing intensified. In a course of one week the city was bombed with over 1,000 shells (800 of which were reactive shells). On February 23, ten servicemen in the Russian-led CIS 366th Motorized Rifle Regiment (of the 23rd Motor Rifle Division, 4th Army) headquartered in Stepanakert, tasked with maintaining peace between the Armenians and Azeris, were injured and one was killed in a bombardment by artillery.|$|E

50|$|The {{flash point}} may {{sometimes}} {{be confused with}} the autoignition temperature, which is the temperature at which the vapor ignites spontaneously without an ignition source. The <b>fire</b> <b>point</b> is the lowest temperature at which vapors of the material will keep burning after being ignited and the ignition source removed. The <b>fire</b> <b>point</b> is higher than the flash point, because at the flash point more vapor may not be produced rapidly enough to sustain combustion. Neither flash point nor <b>fire</b> <b>point</b> depends directly on the ignition source temperature, but it may be understood that ignition source temperature will be considerably higher than either the flash or <b>fire</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E

50|$|There are {{two basic}} types of flash point measurement: open cup and closed cup. In open cup devices, the sample is {{contained}} in an open cup which is heated and, at intervals, a flame brought over the surface. The measured flash point will actually vary with {{the height of the}} flame above the liquid surface and, at sufficient height, the measured flash point temperature will coincide with the <b>fire</b> <b>point.</b> The best-known example is the Cleveland open cup (COC).|$|E
50|$|It {{was also}} often {{necessary}} to widen and deepen the ditch outside {{the walls to}} create a more effective barrier to frontal assault and mining. Engineers from the 1520s were also building massive, gently sloping banks of earth called glacis in front of ditches so that the walls were almost totally hidden from horizontal artillery fire. The main benefit of the glaces was to deny enemy artillery the ability to <b>fire</b> <b>point</b> blank. The lower the angle of elevation, the higher the stopping power.|$|E
50|$|A <b>firing</b> <b>point</b> is a {{prepared}} fighting position from which infantry can defend territory with minimal exposure to return fire. Construction ranges from simple sandbag walls to sophisticated, permanent fortifications. Large artillery emplacements, for example, {{are vulnerable to}} attack by lightly armed and mobile troops who can avoid the primary armament's field of fire by dispersal or stealth, or {{by taking advantage of}} the limitations in the weapon's traverse or depression. Military engineers typically include <b>firing</b> <b>points</b> in these constructions, allowing defenders to deflect such an attack. This includes slit trenches, pillboxes, and redoubts.|$|R
50|$|The second defense zone, {{located about}} 10 km behind the outer defense zone and {{covering}} {{the most important}} directions, was composed {{of a set of}} <b>firing</b> <b>points</b> connected with trenches.

Between the outer and the second defense zones, a set of small <b>firing</b> <b>points</b> and garrisons was also created in order to slow down a Soviet advance should the Red Army break through the outer defense zone. Behind the second zone, heavy guns were positioned.|$|R
