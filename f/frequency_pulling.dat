50|$|Among the {{significant}} <b>frequency</b> <b>pulling</b> mechanisms inherent {{to the gas}} cell are wall-shift, buffer-gas shift, cavity-shift and light-shift. The wall-shift occurs as the gas bumps into {{the wall of the}} glass container. Wall-shift can be reduced by wall coating and compensation by buffer gas. The buffer gas shift comes from the reference atoms which bounce into buffer gas atoms such as neon and argon; these shifts can be both positive and negative. The cavity shift comes from the RF cavity, which can deform the resonance amplitude response; this depends upon cavity centre frequency and resonator Q-value. Light-shift is an effect where frequency is pulled differently depending on the light intensity, which often is modulated by the temperature shift of the rubidium lamp and filter cell.|$|E

KuhnAn {{analysis}} of <b>frequency</b> <b>pulling</b> in a varactor-tuned LC VCO under coupling from an on-chip PA is presented. The large-signal {{behavior of the}} VCO's inversion-mode MOS varactors is outlined, and the susceptibility of the VCO to <b>frequency</b> <b>pulling</b> from PA aggressor signals with various modulation schemes is discussed. We show that if the aggressor signal is aperiodic, band-limited, or amplitude-modulated, the varactor-tuned LC VCO will experience <b>frequency</b> <b>pulling</b> due to time-modulation of the varactor capacitance. However, if the aggressor signal has constant-envelope phase modulation, VCO pulling can be eliminated, even {{in the presence of}} coupling, through careful choice of VCO frequency and divider ratio. Additional mitigation strategies, including new inductor topologies and system-level architectural choices, are also examined. The analysis is then applied to improve a fully-integrated half-duplex UHF micro- transceiver in which signal coupling between the LO and PA caused <b>frequency</b> <b>pulling</b> that prevented the use of QPSK signaling at certain data rates. We determine that a VCO operating at 4 x transmit frequency will be naturally insensitive to pulling from QPSK signals. To validate the proposed solution, a prototype IC containing a pair of QPSK transmitters with integrated 100 mW Class-C PAs was designed and fabricated in 0. 18 um SOI. The transmitters [...] one utilizing a 2 x VCO, one utilizing a 4 x VCO [...] were designed to closely match the performance of the original microtransceiver when transmitting QPSK data. The transmitter with the 2 x VCO experienced <b>frequency</b> <b>pulling</b> from the PA while transmitting QPSK data, but the transmitter with the 4 x VCO did not, thereby confirming the analysis in this work. A revision of the microtransceiver was designed in 0. 5 [mu]m SOS utilizing an off- chip PA inductor to reduce signal coupling with the VCO. A second revision of the microtransceiver with two prototype transmitters was designed in 0. 25 [mu]m SOS uti- lizing 4 x VCOs and figure- 8 VCO inductors for maximum insensitivity to pulling from QPSK and band-limited modulation, as well as other design improvements that leverage the higher f[subscript]t of the smaller process.

Using a simplified process, we first fabricated bimorph cantilevers on top of silicon, by surface micromachining techniques in which the upper electrode is {{a thin layer of}} Chromium {{on the top of a}} thick layer of dielectric material which is Silicon Rich Nitride (SiN). The resonance <b>frequencies</b> and <b>pull</b> in voltages of these electrostatically actuated bimorph cantilevers with off-state deflection [2] are analysed and it is found that the higher resonance frequencies come at the price of larger switching voltages (Figure 2 - 3). This allows for fabrication of relative stiff cantilevers with resonance frequencies in the MHz range to interact with the evanescent field of PBG crystals in which the mechanical elements start to play a role typically with a distance < 400 nanometers. We have also fabricated bimorph cantilevers without tips, integrated on top of various optical systems like ring resonators, photonic crystals and planar waveguides. Analytical and numerical models are developed to predict the resonance frequencies and the pull-in voltages of these switches, including the effect of undercut and validated it with experimental data.

40|$|Ring laser {{gyroscopes}} are {{inertial sensor}} {{based on the}} Sagnac effect: rotation causes {{the frequency of the}} two counter-propagating beam in the ring cavity to be shifted by an amount proportional to the angular velocity. This shift (the Sagnac frequency) can be easily measured letting the two beams beat. Applications of ring laser gyros range from inertial navigation system to geodesy, to test of fundamentals physics. Several large laser gyros with high sensitivity have been developed in the last years. This thesis presents the work done with a square ring laser with a side length of 1. 40 m in the contest of the experiment G-pisa of the INFN. This experiment may help improve the performance of the mirrors suspension of the gravitational wave antenna Virgo. The laser design is based on instruments developed by the joint ring laser working group in New Zealand and Germany. It is a helium-neon laser working on the 474 THz line of neon. Earth rotation is enough to bias the Sagnac frequency to 110 Hz. The capacitive-coupled discharge exciting the laser, whose stabilization was specially designed, is the flagship of this experiment. In the first apparatus the operation was quite unstable with the laser gyro often blind to rotation. Long term operation of the laser was limited by the contamination of the gas. The laser have been extensively tested. Diagnosis of the discharge shows the prominent role of hydrogen as contaminant, leading to the installation of getter pumps. Ring-down time was measured to check the quality factor of the laser cavity. Investigation of the mode structure proved an invaluable tool to understand the behaviour of the laser. The laser usually works single mode, but unusually good Sagnac signal can be achieved with the laser working multimode. These analysis shows that the gyro is mostly limited by split modes: independent mode jump of counter-propagating beams causing the gyro to be intermittently blind to rotation. Stabilization of the beam intensity has been implemented to obtain more stable operations. Active stabilization of the optical frequency is designed, developed and tested in order to avoid mode jump and improve the performance of the gyro. A piezo-electric transducer is used to move one of the four mirrors, acting on the perimeter of the cavity. This kind of stabilization brings the laser against the subtle effect of backscattering of light of each beam in the other. A simple theoretical treatment of the backscattering and of its influence on the Sagnac effect is reported to explain acquired data, followed by some numerical simulations. Results obtained with this setup are reported: achieved optical frequency stability, prolonged operation (till now of several hours), consequences on the Sagnac <b>frequency</b> (periodic <b>pulling)</b> and rotation sensitivity...|$|R
