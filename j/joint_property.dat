5|$|While early {{efforts to}} legalize {{same-sex}} marriage failed, the legislature approved two bills in 2008 that granted all unmarried couples certain domestic partnership rights, including {{the ability to}} make hospital and nursing home visits, end-of-life choices and other medical decisions, in addition to rights to <b>joint</b> <b>property</b> ownership. Domestic partners must be at least 18 years old and be able to provide an affidavit attesting to their relationship along with two documents, such as joint checking accounts, mortgages or car leases; coverage on health insurance policies or the designation as a primary beneficiary in a will. The laws went into effect on July 1, 2008.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Independence Act 1947 (10 & 11 Geo 6 c. 30) {{passed by}} the Parliament of the United Kingdom divided British India into the two new {{independent}} dominions; the Dominion of India (later to become the Republic of India) and the Dominion of Pakistan (later to become the Islamic Republic of Pakistan). The act provided a mechanism for division of the Bengal and Punjab provinces {{between the two nations}} (see partition of India), establishment of the office of the Governor-General, conferral of complete legislative authority upon the respective Constituent Assemblies, and division of <b>joint</b> <b>property</b> between the two new countries. The act later received royal assent on 18 July 1947. The partition was accompanied by violent riots and mass casualties, and the displacement of nearly 15 million people due to religious violence across the subcontinent; millions of Muslim, Sikh and Hindu refugees trekked the newly drawn borders to Pakistan and India respectively in the months surrounding independence. On 14 August 1947, the new Dominion of Pakistan became independent and Muhammad Ali Jinnah was sworn in as its first governor general in Karachi. Independence was marked with widespread celebration, but the atmosphere remained heated given the communal riots prevalent during independence in 1947.|$|E

40|$|Conventional gas metal {{arc welding}} of {{modified}} 9 Cr- 1 Mo steels referred to as P 91 steels is considered difficult due to loss of alloying elements and degradation of weld <b>joint</b> <b>properties.</b> In comparison to the conventional process, pulsed current {{gas metal arc}} welding allows more accurate control of heat input per unit length and electrode deposition and, thus, can be more suitable for the joining of P 91 steel. A detailed experimental study is therefore undertaken to examine the roles of welding current, speed and groove angle in the weld bead profiles and <b>joint</b> <b>properties</b> in multipass pulsed current {{gas metal arc welding}} of 12 mm thick P 91 steel.

25|$|In most cases, a {{domestic}} partnership must be dissolved through filing a court action identical to an action for dissolution of marriage.

The couple must also meet many other requirements that the dissolution be both simple and uncontested: no children (or current pregnancy) within the relationship, no real estate (including certain leases), and little <b>joint</b> <b>property</b> or debt. The parties must also review materials prepared by the Secretary of State, execute an agreement dividing assets and liability, and waive claims to domestic partner support. Where all the requirements are met, the partnership will terminate six months after the filing, unless either party revokes consent.|$|E

2500|$|As {{opposed to}} duress and actual undue influence, where illegitimate {{pressure}} is applied, or presumed undue influence which {{depends on a}} relationship of trust and confidence being abused, further cases allow a vulnerable person to avoid an agreement merely {{on the basis that}} they were vulnerable and exploited. In The Medina the Court of Appeal found that a group of pilgrims shipwrecked on a rock in the Red Sea did not need to pay £4000 they promised to a rescue ship, because the [...] "rescuers" [...] had exploited the pilgrims vulnerable position. To prevent unjust enrichment, the Court substituted an award of £1800. Similarly, in Cresswell v Potter, Ms Cresswell conveyed her ex-husband her share of their <b>joint</b> <b>property</b> in return for release from mortgage repayments, later making him £1400 profit. Because Potter took advantage of Ms Creswell's ignorance of property transactions, Megarry J held the agreement was voidable. One potential exception to this pattern, and now very heavily restricted, is the defence of [...] "non est factum", which originally applied in favour of illiterate people in the 19th century allowed a person to have a signed contract declared void if it is radically different from what was envisaged. In Lloyds Bank Ltd v Bundy, Lord Denning MR proposed it was time that all cases be placed into one unified doctrine of [...] "inequality of bargaining power". This would have allowed escape from an agreement if without independent advice one person's ability to bargain for better terms had been heavily impaired, and would have essentially given courts broader scope to change contracts to the advantage of weaker parties. The idea of a general unified doctrine was disapproved by some members of the House of Lords from 1979. However, specific legislation, such as the Consumer Credit Act 1974, the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985, or the Employment Rights Act 1996 creates targeted rights for contracting parties who lack bargaining power, in the same way specific legislation circumscribes a duty of [...] and good faith. Thus, just as there is no unified theory of bargaining power, a unified doctrine of freedom of contract was dismantled long ago where the parties are not making commercial deals in the course of business.|$|E

Parallel to this, the influence of the adjustable process parameters and the equipment on the workpiece acceleration and the impact properties is analyzed.

In the paper first results considering the model experiment and the analysis of the electromagnetic expansion process are presented and joints manufactured by electromagnetic expansion are characterized...|$|R
