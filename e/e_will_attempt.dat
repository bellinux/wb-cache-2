40|$|The rapid {{expansion}} in neuroscientific research fuelled by {{the advent of}} {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} [fMRI] has been accompanied by popular and scholarly commentary suggesting that neuroscience may substantially alter, and perhaps will even revolutionize, both law and morality. This essay, a contribution to, Law and Neuroscience (M. Freeman, <b>Ed.</b> 2011), <b>will</b> <b>attempt</b> to put such claims in perspective and to consider how properly to think about the relation between law and neuroscience. The overarching thesis is that neuroscience may indeed make some contributions to legal doctrine, practice and theory, but such contributions will be few and modest for the foreseeable future. The first part of this essay describes the law’s implicit folk psychological view of human behavior and why any other model is not possible at present. It then turns to dangerous distractions that have clouded clear thinking about the relation between scientific explanations of human behavior and law. Next, the essay considers how to translate the mechanistic findings of neuroscience into the folk psychological concepts the law employs. Finally, illustrative case studies of the legal relevance of neuroscience studies are presented. The discussion and all the examples focus on criminal law and on competence for the sake of simplicity and coherence, but the arguments are almost all generalizable to other legal contexts...|$|R
40|$|Market {{penetration}} of golf in Belgium: resistance or time lag]. At {{the end of}} the last century, expanded mediatization of golf aroused the interest of investors. Unlike in other countries, the construction of new golfing locations in Belgium did not lead to a proportional rise in the number of players and this has created a problem of profitability. This exploratory research document has twin objectives. One is to investigate the image projected by golf. Is it still a game for the elderly and the privileged few? The other is to examine the potential for expansion of this physical activity in Belgium. Data was collected through surveys and the sample includes golfers from one fifth of the clubs in that country and people who do not play golf at all. The research project is intended to be prospective, i. <b>e.</b> it <b>will</b> <b>attempt</b> to identify indicators that could stimulate the expansion of golfing in Belgium in order to guarantee the profitability of the available facilities. Our analysis, by main components, identifies eight dimensions associated with the golfing profile. Although our sample finds differences when it comes to age, gender and marital status, it does offer an overall view of the practice of this sport. The research also confirms the existence of a potential for development in Belgium and offers concrete guidelines to the promotion of golf...|$|R
