5|$|Penny (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting), Amy (Mayim Bialik) and Bernadette (Melissa Rauch) go for {{afternoon}} tea at a tea parlor {{in an attempt}} to feel more like adults. Once they arrive, they see that only mothers and their children are there; they decide to hit the lobby bar instead. They discuss how they do not feel grown up and how being an adult <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>a</b> good thing.|$|E
5|$|The novelists of the {{dictator}} novel genre combined narrative strategies of both modern and postmodern writing. Postmodern techniques, constructed {{largely in the}} late 1960s and 1970s, included use of interior monologues, radically stream-of-consciousness narrative, fragmentation, varying narrative points of view, neologisms, innovative narrative strategies, and frequent lack of causality. Alejo Carpentier, a Boom writer and contributor to {{the dictator}} novel genre pioneered {{what came to be}} known as magical realism, although the use of this technique <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>a</b> prerequisite of the dictator novel, as there are many that do not utilize magical realism.|$|E

5|$|A {{habitat is}} made up of {{physical}} factors such as soil, moisture, range of temperature, and light intensity as well as biotic factors such as the availability of food and {{the presence or absence of}} predators. Every organism has certain habitat needs for the conditions in which it will thrive, but some are tolerant of wide variations while others are very specific in their requirements. A habitat <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>a</b> geographical area, it can be the interior of a stem, a rotten log, a rock or a clump of moss, and for a parasitic organism it is the body of its host, part of the host's body such as the digestive tract, or a single cell within the host's body.|$|E
5|$|Polling {{stations}} {{are set up}} in public buildings throughout the country; voters may only vote at their assigned polling station (according to their permanent residence), but voters deployed abroad in the armed forces, voters on Croatian-flagged ships and imprisoned voters are allowed to vote elsewhere. Other voters residing in Croatia, but traveling abroad on election day may vote at Croatian diplomatic missions. Polling {{stations are}} open from 7:00am until 7:00pm, but all voters present at the polling stations at closing time are allowed to vote. Polling stations may be closed early if all registered voters have voted. Presidential election ballots contain a list of candidates verified by the State Electoral Commission, in alphabetical order. This entails the name and PIN of each candidate, {{and the names of}} political parties endorsing the candidate (or a note that the candidate is running as an independent. The names are preceded by ordinal numbers. Parliamentary election and European Parliament election ballots contain the name of the slate {{and the name of the}} person heading the list, in addition to candidates, who <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>a</b> candidate on the particular list, but may be included as a figurehead symbolizing specific political party or a coalition putting forward the list—usually head of the party of coalition at the national level. The lists are in alphabetical order and preceded by an ordinal number. Voting is done by circling the number associated with a particular candidate. Ballots marked otherwise (but positively indicating a candidate for which a vote is cast) are also considered valid. Blank ballots and ballots on which multiple numbers are circled (or multiple candidates are otherwise indicated) are invalid. Official results are announced and published by the State Electoral Commission.|$|E

25|$|Female {{infertility}} by chemotherapy {{appears to}} be secondary to premature ovarian failure by loss of primordial follicles. This loss <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>a</b> direct effect of the chemotherapeutic agents, but {{could be due to}} an increased rate of growth initiation to replace damaged developing follicles.|$|E
25|$|Density – The {{density of}} a fish shoal {{is the number of}} fish divided by the volume {{occupied}} by the shoal. Density <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>a</b> constant throughout the group. Fish in schools typically have a density of about one fish per cube of body length.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the central}} criticisms of Gestaltism {{are based on the}} {{preference}} Gestaltists are deemed to have for theory over data, and a lack of quantitative research supporting Gestalt ideas.

25|$|Moreover, for 41% of cases, {{secondary}} social sharing occurred {{the very}} same day as the primary social sharing situation. Yet secondary sharing <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>a</b> short-lived occurrence; participants reported that they sometimes still talked about the episode several times, and sometimes talked about it several months later.|$|E

25|$|During {{these early}} studies {{it became known}} that there were {{associations}} with many autoimmune diseases. And the HLA A1-B8 haplotype is linked to a very long piece of conserved chromosome 6 variant called AH8.1 haplotype. In these studies HL-A1,8 were frequently found co-linked to disease. This linkage <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>a</b> function of either gene, but {{a consequence of the}} way AH8.1 evolved.|$|E
25|$|Many {{operations}} in set theory, {{such as the}} power set, have the class of all sets as their domain, and therefore, although they are informally described as functions, they do not fit the set-theoretical definition outlined above, because a class <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>a</b> set. However some definitions of relations and functions define them as classes of pairs rather than sets of pairs and therefore do include the power set as a function.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between Δ, ε, and S ensure that certain natural homomorphisms of vector spaces are indeed homomorphisms of A-modules. For instance, the natural isomorphisms of vector spaces M → M ⊗ K and M → K ⊗ M are also isomorphisms of A-modules. Also, {{the map of}} vector spaces M* ⊗ M → K with f ⊗ m → f(m) is also a homomorphism of A-modules.

25|$|Although age <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>a</b> prerequisite, many ballet {{students}} do not begin to dance en pointe earlier than approximately 12–14 years of age because bones in the feet are often too soft prior to that age and, in such cases, serious and permanent foot injuries could result from starting pointe work too early. The long bones in feet begin to harden within the ages of 8 to 14, dancing en pointe before one's bones have hardened can lead to trauma and growth-plate fractures that create deformed feet.|$|E
25|$|The Atash Dadgah is {{the lowest}} grade of sacred fire, and can be consecrated within {{the course of a}} few hours by two priests, who alternatingly recite the 72 verses of the Yasna liturgy. Consecration may {{occasionally}} include the recitation of the Vendidad, but this is optional. A lay person may tend the fire when no services are in progress. The term <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>a</b> consecrated fire, and the term is also applied to the hearth fire, or to the oil lamp found in many Zoroastrian homes.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{characteristic}} state function for an ensemble has been calculated {{for a given}} system, that system is 'solved' (macroscopic observables can be extracted from {{the characteristic}} state function). Calculating the characteristic state function of a thermodynamic ensemble <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>a</b> simple task, however, since it involves considering every possible state of the system. While some hypothetical systems have been exactly solved, the most general (and realistic) case is too complex for an exact solution. Various approaches exist to approximate the true ensemble and allow calculation of average quantities.|$|E
