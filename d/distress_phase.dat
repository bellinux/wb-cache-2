We reach beyond correlation-based analyses of interest rate sensitivity and keep our scope centered at capital gains of emerging market corporates and U. S. government bonds portfolios. Our empirical analysis spans over the period 2002 – 2015. We address interest rate sensitivity of assets during the ignition, apogee, and {{the aftermath of the}} global financial crisis. Based on historical data series, we evidence that the emerging market corporate bonds exhibit two different regimes of sensitivity to interest rate changes. We observe switching from a positive sensitivity under the normal market conditions to a negative one during <b>distressed</b> <b>phases</b> of business cycles and provide economical explanations of such phenomena. We show that emerging market corporate bonds, which on average could appear rather insensitive to the interest rate risk, in fact, present binary interest rate sensitivities.

Our research advances beyond the correlation analyses focused on comovements in yields and/or spreads of risky and risk-free assets. We show that correlationbased analyses of interest rate sensitivity could appear rather inconclusive and, hence, we investigate the bottom line profit and loss of a hypothetical model portfolio of corporates. We consider historical data covering the period 2002 – 2015, which enable us to assess interest rate sensitivity of assets during the development, the apogee, and {{the aftermath of the}} global financial crisis. Based on empirical evidence, both for investment and speculative grades securities, we find that the emerging market corporates exhibit two different regimes of sensitivity to interest rate changes.

Preparation programmes for general anaesthesia (GA) are highly effective in reducing this <b>distress.</b> A <b>Phase</b> II study has already verified {{the effectiveness of a}} prototype preoperative GA-coping computer game to help children cope with induction in a dental GA setting. The biggest patient users of pediatric GA services in the UK are children who need to have teeth removed (estimated to be 100, 000 yearly). Tooth decay is the most common disease in children worldwide. This study is a Phase III randomized controlled trial (RCT) and will evaluate the effectiveness of the new internet version of this game. Methods/design The Phase III RCT will use a double-blind three-armed design. The clinical trial will recruit up to 210 children and will compare the web-based game against standard care and another non-medical game. At least 53 patients in each group will be required for 90 % statistical power. Distress will be assessed through an evaluation of the child’s behaviour during the visit and later parental reports of physical and psychological morbidity. The satisfaction of parents and children will be measured; the mode of usage of the web-based game will be automatically recorded and the impact on the service (for example, recovery time and throughput) will be reported. The Phase III study primary outcome will measure: (1) patient experience: acceptance of anaesthetic induction, child cooperation and distress, reduction of peri- and postoperative morbidity, child and family satisfaction, and (2) service improvement: anaesthetic time and improvement in throughput. Measures will be administered at baseline, {{at the time of the}} GA treatment visit, and at 48 hours and one week postoperatively.

40|$|Long pentraxin PTX 3 is a newly {{discovered}} acute phase protein produced at {{the sites of}} infection and inflammation by tissue cells, macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells. PTX 3 {{plays an important role}} in preventing infection of certain fungi, bacteria and viruses in the lung. Recombinant PTX 3 has been proposed as a potential anti-fungal molecule for therapy. However, under certain experimental conditions, such as intestinal ischemia-reperfusion, high volume mechanical ventilation, or severe bacterial infection, increased expression of PTX 3 is associated with more severe lung injury. Therefore, it is necessary to further explore the sources of PTX 3 in the lung and the regulatory mechanisms of its expression. It is also essential to further determine how PTX 3 binds to pathogens, complement, and apoptotic cells, and to determine whether PTX 3 has a specific receptor in targeted cells. These studies will provide insight into the pathological processes of pulmonary infection and acute lung injury, and provide potential novel therapeutic strategies to control pulmonary infections without severe lung injury.

40|$|Objectives: Vaccinations protect {{children}} against deadly diseases and approximately 30 immunizations are recommended for children by 6 years of age. However, immunization injections cause negative short- and long-term consequences for children. The Gate Control Theory of Pain suggests that physical interventions (e. g., rubbing the site) may be helpful, {{but they are}} not well validated for children’s acute pain. This randomized trial examined the effectiveness of the ShotBlocker®, a physical intervention designed to decrease children’s injection pain. Methods: Participants included 89 4 - to 12 -year-old children receiving immunizations at a pediatric practice. Participants were randomized to ShotBlocker®, placebo control, or typical care control groups. Measures of child distress included self-report, parent report, healthcare provider report, change in heart rate, and observational behavioral coding. Results: No group differences were evident on any of the measures of child pain or anxiety when controlling for child age, nor were there any significant interactions of treatment condition with child age. On the observational distress measure, ANCOVAs revealed significantly higher distress in the injection than pre- or post-injection <b>phases,</b> and post-injection <b>distress</b> was higher than pre-injection <b>phase</b> <b>distress,</b> irrespective of treatment condition.

40|$|AIM: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to delineate partnership-relation functioning over time and specifically matched to various organs such as heart, liver, and kidney. METHOD: Prospective, paralleled case-control-study including patients and their respective partners before and one year after organ transplantation in 23 heart-transplant recipients, 19 liver-transplant patients, and 16 kidney-transplant recipients. To assess partnership functioning, the FB-Z (family assessment measure) of Cierpka and Frevert was used. Statistics included descriptive methods, correlations, and analysis of variance including the items "organ" and "time". RESULTS: Heart-transplant recipients and their partners show significant better overall measures in their partnership ratings (sum-value) in comparison to liver or kidney patients and their partners. In all patient and partner groups, except in kidney-transplant recipients a significant deterioration over time is discernible in the subscales role performance and emotionality. In respect to the item "organ" significant differences were found in overall functioning and the subscale communication where heart-transplant recipients and their partners have significant better functioning compared to kidney or liver transplant patients. In kidney patients and their partners only communication changes to the better in the time course.

40|$|This thesis {{research}} {{has had two}} aims: first, to determine how discontinuous (or “casual”) employment impacts on quality of life, mental health, and coping for a population of Australian job seekers; second, to determine how different groups of workers differ in coping style, quality of life, and mental health when dealing with discontinuous (casual, short-term) work. To address these aims a national survey was conducted of white collar, business and technical/scientific workers (N= 229 at Time 1). Workers were sampled three times over the study period of nine months. The mixed method design consisted of two phases in order to capture {{the richness of the}} phenomena in question. The quantitative phase (QN) was initiated first with a tri-monthly national survey running from July 2006 -until February 2007. The survey yielded information on workers’ employment conditions, job permanency, sense of resilience, and <b>distress</b> levels. <b>Phase</b> QN yielded an “overall snapshot” of worker issues and life facet coping patterns. The qualitative phase (QL) was initiated two weeks after the start of Phase QN. In this phase the investigator conducted semi-structured interviews from a subset of nine workers taken at three- month intervals. Phase QL yielded narratives of nine-month “slices of life” for these respondents, illustrating their most current work/life conflicts and the strategies and attitudes they employed to manage such conflicts. Phase QL also allowed for the uncovering of personal meanings for work-life transitions role conflicts, perceived time shortages and respondents’ personal work-life goals. Narratives, goals and personal meanings were eventually uncovered and were integrated into nine-month case trajectories. Phase QL trajectory results were then compared and integrated with the QN quantitative survey results via a process of audit trailing, data reconfiguring, member checking, and comparing of data sets. Main Findings: for the QN analysis/methods, Distress was predicted by only three Life Facet variables: number of children, permanency (security) of one’s job, and the time of year (season). The outcome variable Resilience/Coherence was predicted by only two of the variables of interest: permanency (job security) and time of year. Overall the weak QN findings could only hint at but not substantiate the patency of the Life Facets Model in explaining discontinuous work. However the Phase QL results showed the Life Facets Model to better fit the coping narratives than other models (of staged grief, active agency, drive reduction, and stress-appraisal-coping). Though some mismatches occurred across the two (QL and QN) methods, most were resolved through mixed method techniques of auditing, cross referencing and integration. Implications of the findings for future research, social welfare, and public policy were suggested...|$|R

The purpose of this study was to determine feasibility of daily symptom data collection via an electronic diary and to examine the relationship between premenstrual symptom perception, severity and distress with academic stress. This sample consisted of 50 women with a mean age of 20 (±. 9) years living in campus housing of a private undergraduate rural college. Results determined it is feasible to utilize an electronic diary for daily prospective symptom and academic demand data collection. Surprisingly, in this sample of healthy undergraduate women, there were significantly higher numbers of symptoms perceived (7. 16 Â± 3. 8 follicular and 6. 18 ± 3. 3 luteal, p=. 001 and higher distress (. 39 ±. 3 follicular and. 31 ±. 3 luteal, p=. 003) in the follicular phase than in the luteal phase. Academic stress findings indicated mild stress as measured by the Student-life Stress Inventory (Gadzella, 1991) and students overall perceived stress levels fell in the minimal to mild range. The academic demand component of academic stress measured daily frequency and distress associated with assignments, papers, projects/presentation and time studying. Within the follicular phase number of assignments due was significantly correlated to symptom perception and distress (. 31,. 37, respectively) and the number of projects/presentations due was correlated to symptom distress (. 25) at p<. 05.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the association among budgeting practices, fiscal outcomes, and financial monitoring efforts and their relationship to fiscal distress. Fiscal distress was defined operationally as those unit school districts that met Illinois State Board of Education financial watch list criteria for 1994 [...] 1995. The study sample consisted of a matched set of 27 Illinois unit school districts. Data for each unit district was collected using the Annual Financial Report for Fiscal Year 1994 [...] 95 and responses to a 34 -item questionnaire. Data was examined using analysis of variance, discriminant function analysis, factor analysis, cross-tabulation procedures, and a non-parametric binomial test. The study consisted of three phases. The first phase was designed to establish a set of ratios between actual to budgeted expenditure and revenue items that could differentiate between watch list and non-watch list unit districts. The second phase sought to examine school leader perceptions regarding issues related to fiscal <b>distress.</b> The third <b>phase</b> investigated relationships between the ratios and school leader perceptions. The primary purpose was to determine which ratios were capable of predicting a unit district's watch list status. The study established the following significant findings. Two expenditure ratios and one revenue ratio were able to discriminate between unit districts on the Financial Watch List and unit districts not on the Financial Watch List. Collectively, both watch list and non-watch list unit districts considered collective bargaining agreements and assessed valuation as extremely important issues to monitor. When analyzed separately, there was clear evidence that watch list unit districts viewed things differently than the general population. Equalized assessed valuation stood alone as the single most important variable to monitor. Non-watch list districts showed a tendency to overestimate expenditures and underestimate revenues. Watch list districts showed a slight tendency to overestimate expenditures, but tended to overestimate their revenues. Based on the analysis of data, it was possible to predict watch list status with 94 % accuracy using a function of 13 expenditure and revenue ratios. The most significant variable for predicting watch list status was an expenditure item related to school administration costs...|$|R
40|$|Young people aged 12 - 25 {{account for}} the highest {{prevalence}} and incidence of mental health disorders across the lifespan (McGorry, Bates & Birchwood, 2013). Onset of mental health disorders, of which anxiety disorders comprise a large portion (Eisenberg, Gollust, Golberstein & Hefner, 2007), are said to present shortly before or during typical college-going years (Kessler, Berglund, Demler, Merikangas & Walters, 2005). A broad body of behavioural researchers emphasize the functional role of fear and avoidance responding as central processes that may underlie and maintain anxiety in humans (Dymond, Bennett, Boyle, Roche & Schlund, in press; Luciano et al; 2014). As an alternative to experiential avoidance of undesirable psychological content, a considerable body research supports the efficacy of cognitive defusion (a behavioural technique derived from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy), {{as a treatment for}} anxiety related behaviour (Hayes et al., 2006). Despite the positive outcomes reported for defusion-based interventions, a functional account of the basic behavioural processes involved in cognitive defusion is not well established (Foody, Barnes-Holmes, Barnes-Holmes & Luciano, 2013). In attempt to expand on the extant compendium of defusion-related analogue component process studies, and shed further light on the behavioural processes that may be responsible for successful defusion outcomes, the current research examined the differential impact of a brief cognitive defusion exercise, (delivered in two distinct formats) on explicit, self-report measures of state anxiety, experiential avoidance and emotional discomfort, believability and willingness to engage with distressful thoughts. In pursuit of this goal, two experiments were conducted with a non-clinical sample of university students (N= 80). Both of the experiments employed a similar procedural sequence and examined the same defusion exercise (the Hands as Thoughts exercise by Harris, (2009)), but differed in terms of the format by which the exercise was delivered, as well as the outcome measures used to assess its effects. At the beginning of both of the experiments, a stress induction paradigm was utilized to experimentally induce distress using a time-based mathematical task, paired with a deceptive statement regarding a previous cohort’s performance of the task. Immediately following the <b>distress</b> induction <b>phase,</b> participants were instructed to discriminate a single self-referential statement (i. e. a verbal stimulus) related to the dominant thought/emotion that they experienced following the math task. This self-referential statement represented the target stimulus with which the defusion exercise would be conducted. Following this, participants in the intervention condition were exposed to the defusion exercise. Alternatively, participants in the control condition were exposed to a distraction-based task. In Experiment 1 (N= 55), which employed a 2 × 2 factorial design, instructions pertaining to the defusion exercise were delivered by the experimenter who modelled the exercise along with participants. Defusion impact/outcomes were assessed using pre- and post-measures of state anxiety and psychological inflexibility/experiential avoidance. Participants exposed to the defusion exercise/intervention (n= 36) reported a significant reduction in state anxiety and psychological inflexibility/avoidance from pre- to post-intervention. Control group participants who were exposed to a distraction-based control task (n= 19) also reported a significant reduction in state anxiety and psychological inflexibility/avoidance from pre- to post-control task. No significant difference was detected between the control and intervention groups in terms of the within-group reductions in psychological inflexibility/avoidance. However, there was a significant between-groups difference regarding the within-group reductions in state anxiety; participants in the intervention condition reported a superior reduction in state anxiety to those in the control condition. In Experiment 2 (N= 35), which employed a 2 × 2 factorial design, instructions pertaining to the cognitive defusion exercise were delivered audibly via an audio-speaker. In addition to pre- and post-measures of state anxiety and psychological inflexibility/avoidance, impact was further assessed using measures of emotional discomfort, believability and willingness to engage with the self-referential thought/emotion (verbal stimulus), in an effort to further examine the potential processes of change. Participants exposed to the defusion intervention (n= 19) reported a significant reduction in state anxiety from pre- to post-intervention. While a slight reduction in psychological inflexibility/avoidance was observed, this reduction was not statistically significant. Similarly, participants reported slight reductions in emotional discomfort and believability, and minimal increases in willingness to engage with the self-referential thoughts, however these changes were not statistically significant. An alternative control task to the one employed in the Experiment 1 was utilized in Experiment 2, whereby participants were requested to employ the typical strategies that would normally use to manage unwanted psychological content. Similar to the effects observed in the intervention condition, control group participants (n= 16) reported a significant reduction in state anxiety post the control task. A slight pre-to-post reduction in psychological inflexibility/avoidance was observed, however the reduction was not statically significant. Slightly reduced levels of emotional discomfort and believability, and slightly increased levels of willingness to engage with self-statements were reported, however these changes were not statistically significant. Findings pertaining to both experiments are discussed in relation to those reported in previous analog component process studies. A discussion of the basic behavioural processes that may have moderated these outcomes is also provided. To the author’s knowledge, no previous empirical research has examined the Hands as Thoughts defusion exercise (Harris, 2009) in isolation from other defusion exercises, thus, a discussion of the basic processes in that may mediate the outcomes of this research may not necessarily apply to other ACT-based defusion exercises, due to the variation of procedural elements involved across different defusion techniques. Behaviour-analytic research surrounding the concept of defusion is not mature, and there remains a deficit of knowledge, and indeed discussion, as to the basic behavioural processes that underlie the concept. The term defusion is somewhat problematic as it is appears to refer to a set of outcomes, which are moderated by an unknown set of behavioural processes, as well as to a number of different therapeutic methodologies. Thus, despite their clinical utility, defusion-based therapeutic methods/techniques are currently being applied with limited precision (Assaz, Roche, Kanter & Oshiro, in press). In addition to extending the current program of empirical research in the area, the present research hopes to contribute to discussions surrounding the behavioural processes that may moderate defusion outcomes from a behaviour-analytic perspective, whilst also considering the procedural limitations of this research, and offering suggestions for future examinations in this area...|$|R
