500|$|Although by then {{retired from}} flying, on 28April 1950—the fortieth {{anniversary of the}} 1910 flight—Paulhan {{repeated}} the journey from London to Manchester, this time as a passenger on board a Gloster Meteor T7, the two-seater training variant of the first British jet fighter. [...] After travelling at 400mph (644km/h), the 67-year-old Frenchman said [...] "C'était magnifique... <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> ever dreamed of in aviation—no propellers, no vibration." [...] The Daily Mail entertained him at the Royal Aero Club in London, where he was accompanied by his former rival, Claude Grahame-White.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{also spoke}} about O'Neal in 2001 with Rabbi Shmuley. He {{described}} holding hands with her: [...] "I was, like, in heaven. It {{was the most}} magical thing. It was better than kissing her, {{it was better than}} anything." [...] He recalled one of the times they held hands:I remember we went to this club, and I don't go to clubs, which was called the Roxy. And I was watching the band, I was sitting there, and underneath the table, she was holding my hand, and I was, like melting. [...] Fireworks going off. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> needed. But that means nothing to kids today. She grew up too fast. She wasn't into innocence, and I love that.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{was sitting}} at my desk {{examining}} the Kolyvagin–Flach method. It wasn't that I believed I could make it work, but I thought that at least I could explain why it didn’t work. Suddenly I had this incredible revelation. I realised that, the Kolyvagin–Flach method wasn't working, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> needed to make my original Iwasawa theory work from three years earlier. So out of the ashes of Kolyvagin–Flach seemed to rise the true answer to the problem. It was so indescribably beautiful; it was so simple and so elegant. I couldn't understand how I'd missed it and I just stared at it in disbelief for twenty minutes. Then during the day I walked around the department, and I'd {{keep coming back to}} my desk looking {{to see if it was}} still there. It was still there. I couldn't contain myself, I was so excited. It was the most important moment of my working life. Nothing I ever do again will mean as much." ...|$|E
60|$|L. Perhaps not. If {{you have}} heard them, and {{anything}} like them, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> want.|$|R
5000|$|Here <b>is</b> my music. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> have to {{tell you}} how I feel. Know that your love keeps my love strong. Stevie ...|$|R
60|$|VERA. Will you {{let these}} men sit down if I give you this? (Takes off her peasant's necklace.) <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> have; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> my mother's.|$|R
2500|$|DeLonge {{first began}} skateboarding {{in the third}} grade, which would consume much his {{activity}} outside of school. [...] "I lived, ate, and breathed skateboarding. All I did all day long was skateboard. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> cared about," [...] he later remarked. He and friends would begin at one side of San Diego and attempt to skateboard to the other half, intermittently pulling pranks on people in the process. As such, he was an average student: [...] "I knew exactly how hard I had to work in school. As long as I got that C, I wouldn't try one minute extra to get a B. I just cared about skateboarding and music." [...] His parents were constantly fighting in his formative years, culminating in a divorce when DeLonge was 18. [...] Shortly thereafter, his mother lost her job. DeLonge promptly moved out, feeling as though he needed to start his life. His brother was also away {{at that time in}} the United States Army, and his departure affected his family. [...] "My mom and sister were left asking, 'What happened to our family?'".|$|E
2500|$|On {{the evening}} of 22 November 1956 Butler, who had just {{announced}} British withdrawal, addressed the 1922 committee (Conservative backbenchers) with Macmillan. After Butler's downbeat remarks, ten minutes or so in length, Macmillan delivered a stirring thirty-five minute speech described by Enoch Powell as [...] "one of the most horrible things that I remember in politics … (Macmillan) with all the skill of the old actor manager succeeded in false-footing Rab. The sheer devilry of it verged upon the disgusting." [...] He expounded on his metaphor that henceforth the British must aim to be [...] "Greeks in the Roman Empire", and according to Philip Goodhart's recollection almost knocked Butler off his chair with his expansive arm gestures. Macmillan wrote [...] "I held the Tory Party for the weekend, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> intended to do". Macmillan had further meetings with Aldrich and Winston Churchill after Eden left for Jamaica (23 November) while briefing journalists (disingenuously) {{that he planned to}} retire and go to the Lords. He was also hinting that he would not serve under Butler.|$|E
60|$|Tho. Nay, I don't know, {{but in a}} fright <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> could do.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have not}} time for it,' said Elizabeth, 'nor {{patience}} if <b>I</b> had time. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> can persuade {{myself to do}} to keep my clothes from being absolute rags.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They tell me I {{can have}} no other fate; that my malady is fatal; but I still hope and fight for my life; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> have to give my country now." ...|$|R
60|$|Such was my purpose. After {{three days}} more of recovery, I {{went down to}} the old place to put it in execution. And how <b>I</b> sped in <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> have left to tell.|$|R
60|$|I nodded my head again. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> {{could do}} to keep myself {{standing}} upright.|$|E
60|$|So I wilted {{right down}} {{on to the}} planks then, and give up; and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> {{could do to keep}} from crying.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> {{could do}} to keep a {{straight}} face. I'd a pretty good idea where she 'ad gorn; and it wasn't Dalston.|$|E
6000|$|... "I will go on," [...] he said; adding hesitatingly,--"Since you are {{not very}} well off, perhaps you would accept this trifle from me. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> only a shilling, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> have to spare." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{horse is}} worth five hundred francs," [...] he said. [...] "The cart {{is an old}} one--two hundred and fifty would pay for <b>it.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> not much, you see, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> have." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Saturn is lovely; Jupiter {{is simply}} sublime; I can see double {{stars in the}} Lion and in the Virgin, where I had seen only a single one before. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> {{required}} to set me going!' ...|$|R
60|$|But now {{my voice}} was fainter. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> could do to get my breath. The room swam round and round before my eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Every day I gazed on {{the lovely}} fruit, which became {{gradually}} {{more and more}} tempting-looking, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> could do not to break the magician's commands.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> {{could do}} to keep awake, but I managed to do so with the aid of an early morning paper I bought on the train.|$|E
6000|$|Deringham stood up, {{and thrust}} aside the bottle Hallam passed him. [...] "Before we {{go any further}} I want you to {{understand}} that if Alton is held up there until December <b>is</b> over <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> ask," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{brought you}} {{something}} to eat, Granny," [...] he panted, as he laid the fish at her feet. He was quite out of breath with running. [...] "It isn't much, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> something. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> could find for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thank God I am not able--if {{those are}} the signs. But yet I am an earl's son and heir. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> can say. I wish you would believe me, but you will not. I know no way to persuade you." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was strange}} {{to be reduced}} to such {{indirect}} evidence on such a point as that; but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> could get, and I had to be content with it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My sweetheart, when I saw {{you doing}} that Dream of What's-the-girl's-bally-name dance just now, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> {{could do to keep}} from rushing out on to the floor and hugging you.' ...|$|E
60|$|She {{turned away}} from him with a little shudder, {{and for the first time}} during the {{interview}} she hid her face in her hands. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> could do to avoid speech.|$|E
60|$|EDSTASTON [continuing recklessly]. This isn't severity: it's tomfoolery. And if {{you think}} it's {{reforming}} my character or teaching me anything, you're mistaken. <b>It</b> may <b>be</b> a satisfaction to you; but if <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> can say <b>is</b> that <b>it's</b> not an amiable satisfaction.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{good luck}} to <b>it,</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> say," [...] responded Mrs. Wilkins, [...] "and if it makes all the gals {{contented}} with their places, and all the mistresses satisfied with what they've got and 'appy in their minds, why, God bless it, say I." ...|$|R
6000|$|He smiled his old {{smile of}} fondness, but dimmed by pain and languor; {{and the heavy}} lids sank over his eyes, but to be at once raised. 'Lucy! Home, Honor! <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> wanted,' he said; 'you will be good to me, such as I am.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> {{cared to}} know. There was naught {{to keep me}} from that balcony now, and with a long, running leap I sprang far aloft until my hands grasped its lowest sill.|$|E
6000|$|... "Was in {{the bushes}} by the drive. Hung on behind. Couldn't let you know before at the pace you were going. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> could do to hang on. Now then, you girls, get out!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{hit it off}} {{rather well}} together," [...] said Comus, and added with {{deliberate}} bluntness, [...] "I suppose she got rather sick at my borrowing money from her. She thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> was after." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Perhaps I {{might think}} so if I {{knew nothing about}} him; but I {{have always had a}} repugnance to him, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> can do not to dislike him more than is right. If I saw him speak to Johnnie, I think I should!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've been {{thinking}} and, for another thing, I found I couldn't get up {{this bit of}} a hill. I suppose it oughtn't to worry me, but it does. You see, a lameness that comes on when <b>I</b> least expect <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> brought back from South Africa." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Grieved am I," [...] said Wayland, [...] "as {{much for}} the fair damsel as for thee, most noble imp of muslin. But vows must have their course; thou wilt find the palfrey at the Angel yonder at Donnington. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> may do for thee with a safe conscience." ...|$|R
