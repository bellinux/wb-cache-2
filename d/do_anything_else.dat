25|$|Of the {{remaining}} {{five members of}} the fleet, one (Warrior) was destroyed by a broadside from USS Brooklyn. Resolute was run ashore and abandoned by her crew. Ten men from CSS McRae boarded her but were unable to get her off, so they burned her. General Breckinridge and General Lovell were abandoned and burned by their crews. Only Defiance escaped unharmed; she fled to New Orleans, where her crew left her and her captain turned her over to Commander Mitchell. Unable to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> Mitchell ordered her to be burned in the general destruction of Confederate property when the city fell.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{admitted}} cowardice, Flashman is a dab hand at fighting {{when he has}} to. Though he dodges danger {{as much as he}} can, {{and runs}} away when no one is watching, after the Piper's Fort incident, he usually controls his fear and often performs bravely. Almost every book contains one or more incidents where Flashman has to fight or perform some other daring action, and he holds up long enough to complete it. For instance, he is ordered to accompany the Light Brigade on its famous charge and rides {{all the way to the}} Russian guns. However, most of these acts of 'bravery' are performed only when he has absolutely no choice and to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> would result in his being exposed as a coward and losing his respected status in society, or being shot for desertion. When he can act like a coward with impunity, he invariably does.|$|E

25|$|Scouts are {{masters in}} the art of moving unseen. The scout’s primary weapons are two daggers, and {{he has the ability to}} become {{temporarily}} invisible and assassinate units instantly from behind with a sneak attack. As a secondary attack, he carries satchel bombs filled with blasting powder as a ranged attack. The scout can also block melee attacks. Finally, Mages serve as the magic class. A mage's primary attack is a bolt of lightning, which can be charged up for a more powerful attack that can also damage other enemies in close proximity to the target. He also wields a “firewall” attack, which creates an expanding circle of flames that will heavily damage if not kill enemies who are within the circle. For close range attacks, they have a shockwave attack, which knocks enemies back and allows the mage to finish them off with his staff. Mages can also heal allies. For defensive purposes, a mage can create a magical shield around himself to protect anyone inside from ranged attacks of any sort, provided the attacker is outside of the shield, which allows people to walk through. While the shield ability is active, the mage is unable to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> and is therefore highly vulnerable to melee attacks.|$|E
25|$|The {{client-side}} (Web browser) technologies used in Web 2.0 development include Ajax and JavaScript frameworks. Ajax programming uses JavaScript and the Document Object Model {{to update}} selected {{regions of the}} page area without undergoing a full page reload. To allow users to continue {{to interact with the}} page, communications such as data requests going to the server are separated from data coming back to the page (asynchronously). Otherwise, the user would have to routinely wait for the data to come back before they can <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> on that page, just as a user has to wait for a page to complete the reload. This also increases overall performance of the site, as the sending of requests can complete quicker independent of blocking and queueing required to send data back to the client. The data fetched by an Ajax request is typically formatted in XML or JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format, two widely used structured data formats. Since both of these formats are natively understood by JavaScript, a programmer can easily use them to transmit structured data in their Web application. When this data is received via Ajax, the JavaScript program then uses the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update the Web page based on the new data, allowing for a rapid and interactive user experience. In short, using these techniques, Web designers can make their pages function like desktop applications. For example, Google Docs uses this technique to create a Web-based word processor.|$|E

500|$|Spin {{magazine}} {{described the}} Pixies' musical style as [...] "Surf music-meets-Stooges spikiness and oft-imitated stop/start and quiet/loud dynamics". Their music {{has also been}} pictured as [...] "an unorthodox marriage of surf music and punk rock, ... characterized by Black's bristling lyrics and hackle-raising caterwaul, Kim Deal's whispered harmonies and waspy basslines, Joey Santiago's fragile guitar, and the persistent flush of David Lovering's drums." [...] The band's music incorporates extreme dynamic shifts; Francis explained in 1991, [...] "Those are the two basic components of rock music... the dreamy side and the rockin' side. It's always been either sweaty or laid back and cool. We do try to be dynamic, but it's dumbo dynamics, because we don't know how to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> We can play loud or quiet—that's it".|$|E

[...] Others, he said, {{were members of the}} political far right who had joined up [...] "to kill commies and blacks", and some were criminals hoping to escape the attention of the French police. Each signed on for two years. The French-speaking unit was placed in the Rhodesia Regiment (RR) as an [...] "independent company".

500|$|Justice Stevens, {{joined by}} Burger, Stewart and Rehnquist, concurring in part and dissenting in {{part in the}} judgment, found it {{unnecessary}} {{to determine whether a}} racial preference was ever allowed under the Constitution. [...] A narrow finding that the university had discriminated against Bakke, violating Title VI, was sufficient, and the court was correct to admit him. [...] "It is therefore perfectly clear that the question whether race can ever be used as a factor in an admissions decision is not an issue in this case, and that discussion of that issue is inappropriate." [...] According to Stevens, [...] "he meaning of the Title VI ban on exclusion is crystal clear: Race cannot be the basis of excluding anyone from a federally funded program". He concluded, [...] "I concur in the Court's judgment insofar as it affirms the judgment of the Supreme Court of California. To the extent that it purports to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> I respectfully dissent." ...|$|E

500|$|Those with fitting names give differing {{accounts}} {{of the effect of}} their name on their career choices. Igor Judge, former Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, said he has no recollection of anyone commenting on his destined profession when he was a child, adding [...] "I'm absolutely convinced in my case it is entirely coincidental and I can't think of any evidence in my life that suggests otherwise." [...] James Counsell on the other hand, having chosen a career in law just like his father, his sibling, and two distant relatives, reported having been spurred on to join the bar from an early age and he cannot remember ever wanting to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> Sue Yoo, an American lawyer, said that when she was younger people urged her to become a lawyer because of her name, which she thinks may have helped her decision. Weather reporter Storm Field was not sure about the influence of his name; his father, also a weather reporter, was his driving force.

At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 56, based on 18 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Entertainment Weeklys Tom Sinclair rated the album a B+, complimenting the [...] "humongous hooks", and Kerrang! gave Bleed Like Me 4 out of 5, describing {{it as the}} [...] "most exciting, touching, and most painfully human material they’ve put out in years". Rolling Stone reviewer David Fricke awarded the album {{three and a half}} stars out of five, writing that [...] "the first two-thirds of Bleed Like Me is easily the best sustained run of studio Garbage since the opening half of their 1995 debut", but that the final tracks had [...] "a samenessa feeling of roaring in circles". Sal Cinquemani of Slant also awarded it three and a half stars out of five; he praised the new sound and wrote that [...] "a few of the songs ("Run Baby Run" [...] and [...] "Right Between the Eyes" [...] in particular) have all the right ingredients but lack the venom present on the group's first two releases". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave Bleed Like Me three stars out of five, writing that the album was enjoyable if outdated in its musical approach [...] "as if the band doesn't quite know how to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> but sound like it's the heyday of post-grunge alt-rock." [...] This opinion was shared by Yahoo! Music's Sharon O’Connell, who wrote that despite the intelligent songs with expertise in [...] "muscly, alt. rock lick or the bubblegum pop hook", Bleed Like Me [...] "strikes a depressingly dated note".|$|E
500|$|Benfica began March {{competing}} {{at three}} levels: the Primeira Liga, the Portuguese Cup and the UEFA Cup. Their first game {{was at the}} Estádio José Alvalade against Sporting CP. Managed by Paulo Bento, the hosts scored the opening goal in the 11th minute with a header by Simon Vukčević. In the 40th minute, Rui Costa's corner kick allowed Cardozo to head in the tying goal. Benfica held second place, five points ahead of Sporting. For Camacho, the result was [...] "very important because we kept our advantage, allowing us to remain in second place". The following Thursday, Benfica hosted Getafe in the UEFA Cup. The match quickly soured for the club when Cardozo was sent off in the ninth minute, and Rubén de la Red scored Getafe's first goal in the 25th minute. During the second half Pablo Hernández added another, and Mantorras scored a 76th-minute consolation goal for Benfica. Camacho said, [...] "We started poorly because Getafe has a good team. With Cardozo's ejection, things got more complicated. In the second half, Benfica was better, the players fought and showed {{we have a chance}} to eliminate them." [...] On 9 March, Benfica hosted União de Leiria. They conceded an opening goal in the 42th minute, scoring two second-half goals in five minutes: one each by Zoro and Cardozo. Serge N'Gal scored a 69th-minute equaliser for the draw. The result had repercussions, as Camacho resigned: [...] "I cannot <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> to improve this team's performance." [...] His resignation, so late in the season, caught Benfica's management by surprise. They opted to not replace him, nominating his assistant Fernando Chalana as manager. Chalana accepted the challenge: [...] "I am here through thick and thin." [...] His first game as manager was against Getafe on the road on 12 March. Benfica had to score two and allow none to progress; Makukula hit the post in the sixth minute, and Getafe qualified with a 77th-minute goal by Juan Ángel Albín. Four days later, Benfica played Marítimo at Barreiros, with Cardozo scoring his 19th goal of the season in the 26th minute. In the second half, Ytalo scored a 75th-minute equaliser for Marítimo. Chalana said, [...] "We had a great first half. We dominated and honestly I was not expecting Marítimo's goal. I was sad with the way it appeared. We did everything to win." [...] The fourth consecutive draw cost Benfica their lead over Vitória de Guimarães for second place. Back from international break, the club hosted Paços de Ferreira on 30 March in a 4–1 win. At half-time, the score was 1–1, but Cardozo and Rui Costa's second-half goals gave Benfica their first domestic win in March.|$|E
