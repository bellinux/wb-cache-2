The spores are spherical (44-50 μm in diameter), orange-yellow, and echinulate with spines 3 μm long. The fawn stem is compressed oval, 1/2*3/4 inches in diameter and 1 inch in length, which rises abruptly from a whitish mycelium 3 inches in height and 13/4*4 inches in diameter.

The ultimate goal of all three articles is to enhance our understanding of Q 6 : 37 – 38, {{as well as of the}} Q document as a whole. In the current article, attention is focused on intertexts from the Old Testament, and the occurrences therein of the word ‘measure’ and the concept of ‘psychostasia’. The implications of these results for our interpretation of Q 6 : 37 – 38 are briefly noted. A second (future) article will focus on intertexts in apocryphal and pseudepigraphical writings from Second Temple Judaism dealing with ‘psychostasia’. A third study will ultimately spell out in more comprehensive detail the implications of the foregoing intertextual investigations on both our understanding of Q 6 : 37 – 38 and our understanding of the Sayings Gospel Q as a whole.

One of these very forces is induced by interest groups, typically represented by lobbyists. Over the past several years, the role of special interests and lobbyists in the United States government has come under increased scrutiny. Specifically on Capitol Hill, these lobbyists routinely pack committee hearings, markups, and galleries of the U. S. House of Representatives and U. S. Senate. More than simply observe the proceedings, these organized interests utilize their extensive resources—from money to information to personnel—to persuade politicians to act favorably to the groups from a policy perspective; those who do so are rewarded. From national pharmaceuticals to California wine growers, almost every company and trade association has lobbyists on Capitol Hill, with cumulative expenditures on lobbying totaling $ 2. 8 billion in 2007 —almost double the amount less than a decade previously. With so many lobbyists promoting their legislative priorities in the halls of the United States Capitol, it seems apparent that interest groups wield influence over elected officials; however, what is debatable is the question of how much this influence affects the American legislative process (Davidson, Oleszek, and Lee 2010, 390) ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{whether there are}} differences in maternal and perinatal outcomes between Slovakia and the UK, and whether any observed variations can be attributed to differences in perinatal care. METHODS: Data on outcomes of perinatal care in Slovakia and the UK between 2006 and 2010 were compared. Perinatal mortality <b>figures</b> included stillbirths <b>weighing</b> 1000 g or more and early neonatal deaths. RESULTS: In Slovakia, the perinatal mortality rate was significantly higher than that in the UK (RR 1. 12; 95 % CI, 1. 06 - 1. 18). Cesarean delivery was significantly more frequent in Slovakia (RR 1. 05; 95 % CI, 1. 05 - 1. 06); instrumental vaginal delivery was less frequent (ventouse delivery, RR 0. 20; 95 % CI, 0. 19 - 0. 21; forceps delivery, RR 0. 09; 95 % CI, 0. 09 - 0. 10). Episiotomy and peripartum hysterectomy were performed more often in Slovakia (episiotomy, RR 4. 10; 95 % CI, 4. 07 - 4. 12; peripartum hysterectomy, RR 2. 02; 95 % CI 1. 65 - 2. 47).

She <b>figured</b> him sternly <b>weighing</b> instances of her levity in this masculine court of inquiry into feminine morality and gruffly dismissing both her and her family with some half-sarcastic, half-tolerant phrase which sealed her doom, {{as far as he was}} concerned, for ever.

Her eyes fixed upon the ground, her brows drawn together, gave William a very fair picture of the resentment that she was forcing herself to control. A certain degree of apprehension, occasionally culminating in a kind of fear, had always entered into his love for her, and had increased, rather to his surprise, in the greater intimacy of their engagement. Beneath her steady, exemplary surface ran a vein of passion which seemed to him now perverse, now completely irrational, for it never took the normal channel of glorification of him and his doings; and, indeed, he almost preferred the steady good sense, which had always marked their relationship, to a more romantic bond. But passion she had, he could not deny it, and hitherto he had tried to see it employed in his thoughts upon the lives of the children who were to be born to them.|$|R

He also bore testimony to the fidelity of the translation." [...] More recently, Barnhart noted that Copway was [...] "fluent in his native dialect and knowledgeable of the traditions of the Ojibwa and other Algonquian groups such as the Lenape, but he was certainly not an expert on the traditions and language of the Delaware." [...] On February 16, 1849, after the documented was republished, Henry Rowe Schoolcraft wrote to Squier that he believed the document is [...] "well sustained by comparisons with such transcripts as I have obtained from bark scrolls, and the tabular pieces of wood called music boards". In 1885, after the third printing, the well-known ethnographer Daniel G. Brinton published a new translation of the text. [...] Brinton explained, [...] "In several cases the figures or symbols appear to me to bear out the corrected translations which I have given of the lines, and not that of Rafinesque.
