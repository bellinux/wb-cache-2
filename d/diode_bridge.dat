5|$|The VFD {{controller}} is a solid-state {{power electronics}} conversion system consisting of three distinct sub-systems: a rectifier bridge converter, a direct current (DC) link, and an inverter. Voltage-source inverter (VSI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below) {{are by far}} {{the most common type of}} drives. Most drives are AC-AC drives in that they convert AC line input to AC inverter output. However, in some applications such as common DC bus or solar applications, drives are configured as DC-AC drives. The most basic rectifier converter for the VSI drive is configured as a three-phase, six-pulse, full-wave <b>diode</b> <b>bridge.</b> In a VSI drive, the DC link consists of a capacitor which smooths out the converter's DC output ripple and provides a stiff input to the inverter. This filtered DC voltage is converted to quasi-sinusoidal AC voltage output using the inverter's active switching elements. VSI drives provide higher power factor and lower harmonic distortion than phase-controlled current-source inverter (CSI) and load-commutated inverter (LCI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below). The drive controller can also be configured as a phase converter having single-phase converter input and three-phase inverter output.|$|E
5|$|While {{harmonics}} in the PWM output {{can easily}} be filtered by carrier-frequency-related filter inductance to supply near-sinusoidal currents to the motor load, the VFD's diode-bridge rectifier converts AC line voltage to DC voltage output by super-imposing non-linear half-phase current pulses thus creating harmonic current distortion, and hence voltage distortion, of the AC line input. When the VFD loads are relatively small {{in comparison to the}} large, stiff power system available from the electric power company, the effects of VFD harmonic distortion of the AC grid can often be within acceptable limits. Furthermore, in low-voltage networks, harmonics caused by single-phase equipment such as computers and TVs are partially cancelled by three-phase <b>diode</b> <b>bridge</b> harmonics because their 5th and 7th harmonics are in counterphase. However, when the proportion of VFD and other non-linear load compared to total load or of non-linear load compared to the stiffness at the AC power supply, or both, is relatively large enough, the load can {{have a negative impact on}} the AC power waveform available to other power company customers in the same grid.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{technologies}} used for variable-gain amplification, each having different advantages and disadvantages. Vacuum tubes are used in a configuration called variable-mu where the grid-to-cathode voltage changes to alter the gain. Optical compressors use a photoresistor and a small lamp (Incandescent, LED or electroluminescent panel) to create changes in signal gain. Other technologies used include field effect transistors and a <b>diode</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E

40|$|For the TESLA Test Facility at DESY modulators, which {{generate}} high voltage, {{pulses of}} 130 kV with an electrical power {{of up to}} 16. 8 MW are used. The pulses have a repetition rate of up to 10 Hz and a width of 1. 7 ms. Since {{it is not possible}} to take the pulsed energy directly from the mains the required energy is stored in capacitor banks to be released during the pulse. Power supplies are needed to recharge the capacitor banks of the modulators without disturbing the mains. In particular the low repetition rate of the pulses has to be suppressed. Tobe independent from the repetition rate the power supplies have to operate in a constant power mode. The DC charging current into the capacitors decreases during the loading with the same factor with which the voltage increases. In this way the current taken from the threephase mains is constant. Different types of power supplies have been investigated at DESY and are described here. These types are antiductors with secondary <b>diode</b> <b>bridges,</b> switched mode power supplies, <b>diode</b> <b>bridges</b> plus series switched mode supplies, <b>diode</b> <b>bridges</b> with SCR bridges in sequential phase control...|$|R
25|$|Since modern {{thyristors}} {{can switch}} {{power on the}} scale of megawatts, thyristor valves have become the heart of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) conversion either to or from alternating current. In the realm of this and other very high-power applications, both electrically triggered (ETT) and light-triggered (LTT) thyristors are still the primary choice. The valves are arranged in stacks usually suspended from the ceiling of a transmission building called a valve hall. Thyristors are arranged into a <b>diode</b> <b>bridge</b> circuit and to reduce harmonics are connected in series to form a 12-pulse converter. Each thyristor is cooled with deionized water, and the entire arrangement becomes one of multiple identical modules forming a layer in a multilayer valve stack called a quadruple valve. Three such stacks are typically mounted on the floor or hung from the ceiling of the valve hall of a long-distance transmission facility.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, the {{traction}} motors and generator were DC machines. Following {{the development of}} high-capacity silicon rectifiers in the 1960s, the DC generator was replaced by an alternator using a <b>diode</b> <b>bridge</b> to convert its output to DC. This advance greatly improved locomotive reliability and decreased generator maintenance costs by elimination of the commutator and brushes in the generator. [...] Elimination of the brushes and commutator, in turn, disposed {{of the possibility of}} a particularly destructive type of event referred to as a flashover, which could result in immediate generator failure and, in some cases, start an engine room fire.|$|E

A forward-biased Schottky diode does not have any minority carrier charge storage. This allows them to switch more quickly than regular diodes, resulting in lower transition time from the sample to the hold step. The absence of minority carrier charge storage also results in a lower hold step or sampling error, resulting in a more accurate sample at the output.|$|R

It was later published in Elektronische Zeitung, vol. 25 in 1897 with annotation that German physicist Leo Graetz also was researching this matter at that time. Today the circuit is still often referred as Graetz circuit or Graetz bridge.|$|E
50|$|Efficiency of {{automotive}} alternators {{is limited by}} fan cooling loss, bearing loss, iron loss, copper loss, and the voltage drop in the <b>diode</b> <b>bridges.</b> Efficiency reduces dramatically at high speeds mainly due to fan resistance. At medium speeds efficiency of today's alternators is 70-80%. This betters very small high-performance permanent magnet alternators, such as those used for bicycle lighting systems, which achieve an efficiency around 60%. Larger permanent magnet electric machines (that can operate as motors or alternators) can achieve today much higher efficiencies. Pellegrino et al., for instance, propose not particularly expensive designs that show ample regions in which efficiency is above 96%. Large AC generators used in power stations run at carefully controlled speeds and have no constraints on size or weight. They have very high efficiencies as high as 98%.|$|R

In case of a fixed mains connection, use of an artificial mains network is problematic.

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{single-phase}} self-driven synchronous rectification (SDSR) technique to multiphase ac-dc systems. Power MOSFETs with either voltage- or current-sensing self-driven gate drives {{are used to}} replace the diodes in the rectifier circuits. The generalized methodology allows multiphase SDSRs to be designed to replace the multiphase diode rectifiers. Unlike the traditional SR that is designed for high-frequency power converters, the SDSR proposed here can be a direct replacement of the power <b>diode</b> <b>bridges</b> for both low- and high-frequency operations. The SDSR utilizes its output dc voltage to supply power to its control circuit. No start-up control is needed because the body diodes of the power MOSFETs provide the diode rectifier for the initial start-up stage. The generalized method is demonstrated in 2 -kW one-phase and three-phase SDSRs for inductive, capacitive, and resistive loads.

50|$|A typical {{application}} of inrush current limiters {{is in the}} input stage of non-power factor corrected switching supplies, to reduce the initial surge of current from the line input to the reservoir capacitor.

The primary reason for having surge current suppression in a SPS {{is to protect the}} <b>diode</b> <b>bridge</b> rectifier as the input or charging capacitor is initially charged.
