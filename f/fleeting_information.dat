40|$|Trait inferences occur {{routinely}} {{and rapidly}} during social interaction, sometimes based on scant or <b>fleeting</b> <b>information.</b> In this research, participants (perceivers) made inferences of targets’ big-five traits after briefly watching {{or listening to}} an unfamiliar target (a third party) performing various mundane activities (telling a scripted joke or answering questions about him/herself or reading aloud a paragraph of promotional material). Across three studies, when perceivers judged targets to be either low or high {{in one or more}} dimensions of the big-five traits they tended to be correct, but they did not tend to be correct when they judged targets as average. Such inferences seemed to vary in effectiveness across different trait dimensions and depending on whether the target’s behavior was presented either in a video with audio, a silent video or just in an audio track – perceivers generally were less often correct when they judged targets as average in each of the big-five traits across various information channels (videos with audio, silent videos and audios). Study 3 replicated these findings in a different culture. We conclude with discussion of the scope and the adaptive value of this trait inferential ability...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} investigated whether {{negative attitudes}} towards an out-group interferes with perception of emotional expressions on faces of differing ethnicity. 3 DUWLFLSDQWV¶ DELOLW WR selectively process either emotional or racial information {{was assessed using}} the Garner Interference Task (GIT). The stimuli consisted of photographs of Scandinavian-appearing (s) or Middle-Eastern-appearing (ME) men expressing either happiness or anger. Participants either classified the faces according to emotional expression, or according to apparent race. To assess attitudes towards Middle-Easterners and Scandinavians, participants performed a Swedish-Moslem IAT. The emotion-GIT revealed interference from ethnicity, which also interacted with the IAT such that those with low IAT scores (ME preference) showed greatest interference for angry ME faces whereas those with high IAT scores showed a facilitation for S happy faces. Emotional expression generally did not interfere with processing in the race-GIT, although individuals with low IAT scores showed facilitation for angry ME faces. Faces are communicative. When we look at a face, we immediately apprehend relatively stable information such as gender, ethnicity, age and identity, {{as well as more}} <b>fleeting</b> <b>information</b> such as emotional expression and gaze. What we see is also, in part, dependent o...|$|E
5000|$|Secrecy {{appeals to}} leaders of nation that value {{openness}} and accountability. The power to withhold, leak, and lie about <b>information</b> seems <b>fleeting</b> when the <b>information</b> is publicly revealed. [...] "If you only {{know what we}} know" [...] remarks are tempting for officials. The power to withhold and leak leads to the power to lie. Examples of this were found in President Eisenhower's CIA actions, President Kennedy’s Bay of Pigs and Vietnam actions, President Johnson’s Vietnam operations, and President Nixon’s Cambodia bombing. Between 1965 and 1975, the number of US citizens who believed their government was lying had greatly increased because of the government’s secrecy system. Perhaps the United States would have benefited from leaks about the CIA in the 1950s, the Bay of Pigs operation, war crimes in Vietnam, and wars in Laos and Cambodia by avoiding those disasters.|$|R
