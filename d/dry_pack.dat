40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{performance}} of concrete is dependent on the packing density of the aggregate. All existing methods of measuring the packing density of aggregate are carried out under dry condition. However, these <b>dry</b> <b>packing</b> methods are sensitive to the amount of compaction applied and do not account for the effect of water in the concrete mix. In this research, a new method, which measures the packing density of aggregate under wet condition, has been developed. It is called the wet packing method and has the advantages that it is less sensitive to the amount of compaction applied and that it includes the effect of water. The wet packing method was compared to the <b>dry</b> <b>packing</b> method by applying both methods to measure the packing density of crushed rock fine aggregate. It was found that the packing density of crushed rock fine aggregate can be 24 % higher under wet condition than under dry condition and that the addition of superplasticizer can have a marginal contributing effect. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the beneficial effect of blending different size aggregates together is better revealed by the wet packing method than by the <b>dry</b> <b>packing</b> method. © 2008 RILEM. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|About {{three years}} after the Goldstone Deep Space Station antenna was dedicated, grout under the {{hydrostatic}} bearing runner was found to be interacting with the runner, causing rust to form between the runner and the sole plates upon which it rests. The rust formed unevenly and the runner could not be kept flat so in 1969 the grout was removed and replaced with a Portland cement and sand <b>dry</b> <b>pack</b> grout that was less likely to produce rust. In the years that followed, oil leaking from the runner assembly caused progressive deterioration of the drypack grout. In 1982 over one thousand hours of spacecraft tracking time were lost due to this deterioration. A plan was developed to rehabilitate the bearing. The plan called for raising the rotating structure free from the concrete pedestal and placing it on three pairs of external support columns. With the weight of the structure transferred to the columns, the pads and runner could be removed and the repair started.

Root rot diseases are widespread; control measures include fungicide seed treatments and cultural practices. White mold and bacterial blights are important diseases, but are mostly controlled through cultural practices. Insect damage is less frequent but can be significant. Without the registration of new, effective materials to replace them, the loss of EPTC, trifluralin, metolachlor, ethalfluralin or bentazon would have significant impacts on production and profitability. The availability of the herbicide fomesafen is a critical need for dry bean producers and processors in New York.

40|$|The Savannah River National Laboratory {{measured}} the hydraulic conductivity of peat samples using method ASTM D 4511 - 00. Four samples of peat were packed into 73 mm diameter plastic tubes and saturated {{from the bottom}} up with water. The columns were packed with Premier ProMoss III TBK peat to a dry density of approximately 0. 16 gm/cc (10 lb/ft 3). One column was packed using oven dried peat and the other 3 were packed using as delivered peat. The oven dried sample was the most difficult to saturate. All of the peat samples expanded during saturation resulting in a sample length (L) that was longer than when the sample was initially packed. Table 1 contains information related to the column packing. After saturation the hydraulic conductivity test was conducted using the apparatus shown in Figure 1. Three of the samples were tested at 2 different flow conductions, 1 high and 1 low. Table 2 and Figure 2 contain the results of the hydraulic conductivity testing. Each test was run for a minimum of 40 minutes to allow the test conditions to stabilize. The hydraulic conductivity {{at the end of each}} test is reported as the hydraulic conductivity for that test. The hydraulic conductivity of the 4 peat samples is 0. 0052 {+-} 0. 0009 cm/sec. This result compares well with the hydraulic conductivity measured in the pilot scale peat bed after approximately 2 months of operation. The similarity in results between the <b>dry</b> <b>pack</b> sample and moist pack samples shows the moisture content at the time of packing had a minimal effect on the hydraulic conductivity.

30|$|The {{difference}} is within 10 % excluding samples G 0.64 and G 0.34. Still {{it is needed}} to discuss the high error of G 0.64. It {{should be noted that}} its measured viscosity is out of trend, which strongly points to measurement error. Sample G 0.34 showed extremely high viscosity, which caused the estimation to lose its accuracy. Water absorption of fines reportedly maximizes with smaller particles, which will be discussed in the next paragraph. The other samples {{can be explained by the}} Krieger–Dougherty equation, which is also valid for the mixed sample case. Measurement of wet packing, contrary to the <b>dry</b> <b>packing</b> adopted in this study, is expected to decrease the difference because the hydrodynamic properties of grains are not consistent when they are floating in a suspended medium (Kwan et al. 2012). Additionally, as a possible factor, the chemical admixtures used in this research are affected by changing packing density under wet conditions, which induces errors between predicted viscosity and <b>dry</b> <b>packing</b> density. For better prediction, although the wet packing conditions of suspension should be evaluated with the influence of chemical admixtures, as per Bentz et al. (2012), it is difficult to evaluate the influence of superplasticizers on packing conditions of suspensions. Furthermore, according to Wallevik and Wallevik (2011), superplasticizer is considered to only affect yield stress of cement paste; furthermore, VMA changes the medium of the suspension rather than the particles. Although this theoretical background as per Quiroga and Fowler (2004) and Bentz et al. (2012) may not follow a prescribed methodology in a practical aspect, this research agrees with their findings that the addition of chemical admixtures to the samples can be considered a factor causing prediction error.|$|R
