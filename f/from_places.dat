5|$|Marrakesh {{has long}} been an {{important}} centre for healthcare in Morocco, and the regional rural and urban populations alike are reliant upon hospitals in the city. The psychiatric hospital installed by the Merinid Caliph Ya'qub al-Mansur in the 16th century was described by the historian 'Abd al-Wahfd al- Marrakushi {{as one of the greatest}} in the world at the time. A strong Andalusian influence was evident in the hospital, and many of the physicians to the Caliphs came <b>from</b> <b>places</b> such as Seville, Zaragoza and Denia in eastern Spain.|$|E

5|$|The black-on-white painted pottery {{found at}} Chaco Canyon {{originated}} from various places throughout the Four Corners region, including the Red Mesa Valley, northeastern Arizona, the San Juan River, and the Chuska Valley, forty miles distant. Whereas {{most of the}} gray ware, non-decorative or utility, pottery uncovered at Puebloan sites was produced locally, {{more than half of}} the vessels found in the canyon were imported <b>from</b> <b>places</b> like the Chuska Valley, which supplied the majority of utility pottery found in the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the battalion's personnel arrived on 27 and 28 July. Coming from across the state of New South Wales, the men were drawn <b>from</b> <b>places</b> such as Tamworth, Newcastle, Wagga, Goulburn, and Liverpool, with roughly 60 percent coming from rural backgrounds. With an authorised strength of around 900 men, the battalion was organised around a battalion headquarters, with a regimental aid post, four rifle companies and a headquarters company consisting of various support platoons and sections including signals, mortars, transport (later carriers), pioneers, anti-aircraft and administration.|$|E
5|$|After {{releasing}} 12-inch singles on Big Apple, they founded DMZ Records, {{which has}} released fourteen 12"s to date. They also began their night DMZ, held {{every two months}} in Brixton, a part of London already strongly associated with reggae. DMZ has showcased new dubstep artists such as Skream, Kode9, Benga, Pinch, DJYoungsta, Hijak, Joe Nice, and Vex'd. DMZ's first anniversary event (at the Mass venue, a converted church) saw fans attending <b>from</b> <b>places</b> {{as far away as}} Sweden, the United States, and Australia, leading to a queue of 600 people at the event. This forced the club to move from its regular 400-capacity space to Mass' main room, an event cited as a pivotal moment in dubstep's history.|$|E

At the 2000 Gay Games VI in Sydney, netball and volleyball were the two sports with {{the highest rates of}} transgender athletes participating. There were eight teams of indigenous players, with seven identifying as transgender. They came <b>from</b> <b>places</b> like Palm Island in northern Queensland, Samoa, Tonga and Papua New Guinea. Teams with transgender players were allowed to participate in several divisions including men's, mixed and transgender; they were not allowed to compete against the cisgender women's teams.|$|E
5|$|Local {{residents}} were evicted, including 1,200 {{people who lived}} in shacks around the barracks. Around 300 Jewish residents of Oświęcim were brought in to lay foundations. From 1940 to 1941, 17,000 Polish and Jewish residents of the western districts of Oświęcim were expelled <b>from</b> <b>places</b> adjacent to the camp. The Germans also ordered expulsions of Poles from the villages of Broszkowice, Babice, Brzezinka, Rajsko, Pławy, Harmęże, Bór, and Budy to the General Government. German citizens were offered tax concessions and other benefits if they would relocate to the area. By October 1943, more than 6,000 Reich Germans had arrived. The Nazis planned to build a model modern residential area for incoming Germans, including schools, playing fields, and other amenities. Some of the plans went forward, including the construction of several hundred apartments, but many were never fully implemented. Basic amenities such as water and sewage disposal were inadequate, and water-borne illnesses were commonplace.|$|E
5|$|Sea vessels were {{required}} by law to register at the Castellania to operate in Maltese waters and each had to pay a minimum ten grani, {{depending on the size of}} the vessel and its purpose. With the Registri Patentarum, the Castellania issued legal patents for galleys to travel from the port of Valletta to other ports and vice versa. The patents gave details subject to health inspections which included the names of the merchants and the description of the belongings for trade. Those galleys coming from non-European ports or <b>from</b> <b>places</b> subjected to possible disease were withheld in quarantine for days and only given permission to mix with the rest of the people once a Pratica was issued by the Commission of Public Health. The Clean Bill of Health continued to be issued and gradually reformed during the British period, under the supervision of the Chief Medical Officer. The Castellania imposed a charge for those not having health assurance and having to lodge at the Lazzaretto.|$|E

5|$|The {{election}} {{was held on}} 7 December 1860 in the Sheldonian Theatre. Three special trains were laid on between Didcot and Oxford that afternoon to meet passengers travelling from the west of England, and one additional train was provided between Oxford and London via Didcot in the evening. A London-bound train from the north of England called additionally at Bletchley to allow onward connections to Oxford for passengers <b>from</b> <b>places</b> such as Liverpool, Manchester and Birkenhead. Evangelical clergymen turned out in force to vote. Over about {{five and a half}} hours of voting, 833members of Congregation declared for Williams, 610 for Müller.|$|E
5|$|When the British {{government}} relented in mid-1915, {{having been}} warned by Theodore Roosevelt that the reporting limitations were affecting {{public opinion in}} the United States, Valentine Williams became the Daily Mail's first accredited war correspondent. No longer in prison, Beach Thomas resumed his war reporting in December of the same year, when Williams enlisted in the Irish Guards. As with the other accredited journalists, he was paid by the War Office rather than by his newspaper {{and they were all}} assured that {{they would be able to}} publish memoirs of their service to offset the differential between an officer's pay and that of a journalist. Beach Thomas filed reports <b>from</b> <b>places</b> such as the Somme in a format matching that of his colleagues, who regularly downplayed the unpleasant aspects of the conflict such as the nature of death. His reports were published in the Daily Mirror as well as the Daily Mail.|$|E
5|$|Lindow Man and LindowIII {{were found}} to have {{elevated}} levels of copper on their skin. The cause for this was uncertain as there could have been natural causes, although a study by Pyatt et al. proposed that the bodies may have been painted with a copper-based pigment. To test this, skin samples were taken <b>from</b> <b>places</b> likely to be painted and tested against samples from areas where painting was unlikely. It was found that the copper content of the skin of the torso was higher than the control areas, suggesting that the theory of Pyatt et al. may have been correct. However, the conclusion was ambiguous as the overall content was above that expected of a male, and variations across the body may have been due to environmental factors. Similarly, green deposits were found in the hair, originally thought to be a copper-based pigment used for decoration, but it was later found {{to be the result of}} a reaction between the keratin in the hair and the acid of the peat bog.|$|E
