According to the director, [...] "Once the fight starts, you're very limited and you're {{at the mercy of}} your effects guys... unless they're really technically oriented... it's definitely the time we have the least amount of control as directors." [...] He and other filmmakers worked {{to cut down on the}} fight scene, believing that the film's success would come from the character study of Smith's character, John Hancock, similar to Robert Downey, Jr.'s acclaimed portrayal of Tony Stark in the previous May's superhero release, Iron Man.|$|E

Colbert now often cites the interview segment as his <b>favorite</b> <b>part</b> of the show, because it allows him to improvise.

He thought that despite the lack of a sense of real danger, the plot all comes together neatly and praised the story's effects on Kirk, saying [...] "The way the episode unfolds means Kirk's constantly dealing with things he does not really want to deal with, and there's a surprising amount of enjoyment to be had in seeing him complain about it to Spock." ...|$|E

[...] His <b>favorite</b> <b>part</b> of the episode was when the two teams worked together; he gave {{particular attention to the}} Walter-Walternate talk, remarking, [...] "The last scene between the two Walters is something that I’ve been waiting to see for years now, and John Noble nails both sides of the conversation. It’s now one of the whole series’ signature moments: Walter and Walternate, side-by-side." [...] Other critics also lauded the conversation between Walter and Walternate over Peter.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{acceptance}} of the Bacon cover by Doubleday, Dystel did not like the cover, and assigned New York illustrator Roger Kastel to do a different one for the paperback. Following Bacon's concept, Kastel illustrated his <b>favorite</b> <b>part</b> of the novel, the opening where the shark attacks Chrissie. For research, Kastel went to the American Museum of Natural History, and took advantage of the Great White exhibits being closed for cleaning to photograph the models.

The two new composers were chosen for the soundtrack based on their ability to create music that was different than Uematsu's while still working together. Uematsu states that his music has been inspired by the music of popstar idols such as Elton John and Paul McCartney, and that his <b>favorite</b> <b>part</b> about the soundtrack is the good reviews from listeners. Nakano set out to create music with a [...] "vibrant and dynamic feel" [...] that tied together his years of experience with game music, while Hamauzu tried to use the soundtrack to bring video game music to [...] "greater heights".|$|E

When asked about the dark nature of his songwriting and the cult following he was gaining, Smith said {{he felt it was}} merely a product of his writing songs that were strongly meaningful to him rather than anything contrived. Larry Crane, Smith's posthumous archivist, has said that he was surprised at the amount of [...] "recycling of musical ideas" [...] that he has encountered while cataloging the singer's private tapes: [...] "I found songs recorded in high school reworked 15 years on.

In the chorus, she sings about drug abuse: [...] "You're gone and I gotta stay high / All the time, to keep you off my mind". According to Adam R.

The singer confessed to iHeart Radio that the song's bridge is her <b>favorite</b> <b>part</b> of the track because [...] "that just says everything [...] song is about for me". However, Billboard Jeremy D. Larson considered the song's message untrue because [...] "staying high does not keep anyone off your mind".|$|E
