40|$|Direct {{numerical}} simulations {{are used}} to investigate the method of effusion cooling in a laminar Mach- 2. 67 boundary layer. Air is employed as mean-flow and coolant gas and is introduced into the boundary layer through two staggered or aligned rows of holes {{by means of a}} modeled blowing approach. First, the effects of streamwise <b>inclined</b> <b>blowing</b> with various inclination angles αc are investigated. It is demonstrated that a decreasing inclination angle results in an increasing cooling effectiveness, since the coolant gas remains closer to the wall and the generated vortices are smaller. Furthermore, the influence of an additional compound angle βc is analyzed. In the present work four different cases are investigated, where the effects of the blowing direction, i. e. inclination angle αc and compound angle βc, and the hole arrangement, i. e. aligned and staggered rows, are presented. It was found that a further improvement of the cooling performance can be achieved for the case with aligned rows and opposingly oriented compound angles. There, the cooling effectiveness is found to be significantly higher than for the investigated reference case with two staggered rows of holes without compound angle. 1...|$|E
50|$|The pre-war {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} two large inclined Ross-pop safety valves, {{mounted on the}} upper sides of the boiler {{just ahead of the}} firebox and aimed about 80 degrees apart. When these <b>inclined</b> valves <b>blew</b> off under a station canopy, bystanders often received a shower of slimy wet soot. After the war, they were replaced by four smaller Ross-pop valves at the highest point of the boiler that blew off straight up.|$|R
40|$|Whistle blowing on {{organisational}} wrongdoing {{is becoming}} increasingly prevalent. However, a renewal of existing literature reveals that every potential whistle blower is not always <b>inclined</b> to <b>blow</b> the whistle, despite protection being accorded to whistleblowers through legislation. The cost of blowing the whistle can be a deterrent to potential whistle blowers. It is quite plausible that an organisational culture which institutionalizes a dominant value based system can decrease whistle blowers expectations of retaliation. The purpose of this artide {{is to provide a}} conceptual framework for a dominant value enacted organisational culture which can serve as an impetus for whistle blowing in the public sector. It is important that organisations make their value systems 'lived' practices to motivate potential whistleblowers to report on wrongdoing. It can be argued that the institutionalisation of enacted values can lead to low perceptions of retaliation, which is often a deterrent in blowing the whistle...|$|R
5000|$|He is {{considered}} to be the father of extreme skiing and that has given him the name [...] "skier of the impossible". He has the most difficult 18 descents to his credit. In mountains people are usually known for first ascent of high and difficult peaks but he is famous for first descents (see French Wikipedia). He has skied down Denali (Mount McKinley), the highest mountain in North America; Mont Blanc, the highest mountain in the Alps; Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa; Nun peak in Kargil; {{and a number of other}} peaks in Nepal and the Karakoram. For his 50th birthday, he skied down Japan's Mount Fuji without snow. Saudan’s crowning achievement came in 1982 when, at age 46, he skied down Pakistan’s 26470 ft-high Gasherbrum I, or Hidden Peak. It was the longest 50-degree ski descent ever accomplished—and very well might still be. Additionally, he pioneered and perfected the ability/technique to [...] "jump turn" [...] on steep inclines. This involves placing all the skier's weight on the upper ski (le ski amont), using it and that leg to spring leap, and then twisting the skier's body in the direction of turn. This enabled him to do 180 degree turn on mind <b>blowing</b> <b>inclines.</b>|$|R
