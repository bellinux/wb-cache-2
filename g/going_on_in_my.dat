Cuomo moved to simpler songwriting with less {{personal}} lyrics; he stated that Weezer's subsequent albums the Green Album (2001) and Maladroit (2002) were [...] "very intentionally not about me.

I try to development from a stream of consciousness to something that makes sense". He said the lyrics primarily spoke of relationships, [...] "our {{way of trying to}} keep them, the resulting problems and that kind of thing". Moore cited Roger Waters and Peter Gabriel as influences on his vocal style, [...] "Those guys don’t have the best voices either, but they pull it off then I figured I could do it too," [...] he said. He noted that musically his progressive influences [...] "will always be there" [...] because they influenced all his music, but could not name any other influences as [...] " [...] to so much stuff it just gets lost".|$|E
500|$|The Incredibles as {{a concept}} dates back to 1993 when Bird sketched the family during {{a period in which}} he tried to break into film. Personal issues had percolated into the story as they weighed on him in life. During this time, Bird had inked a {{production}} deal with Warner Bros. Animation and {{was in the process of}} directing his first feature, The Iron Giant. Approaching middle age and having high aspirations for his filmmaking, Bird pondered whether his career goals were attainable only at the price of his family life. He stated, [...] "Consciously, this was just a funny movie about superheroes. But I think that what was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life definitely filtered into the movie." [...] After the box office failure of The Iron Giant, Bird gravitated toward his superhero story.|$|E

500|$|... "Witch Doctor" [...] {{is based}} on a true story where Tinie met a girl at a show who he took with him on the tour bus and showed what it's like to live his life. [...] "It's OK" [...] and [...] "Lover Not a Fighter" [...] are two songs that feature vocals and {{production}} from Labrinth. [...] "It's OK" [...] is a contrast from the [...] "intro and fun, random bouncy things" [...] according to Okogwu. He added [...] "it's very unorthodox in the sense that people wouldn't have heard or even expect us to make a song like this because it's very slow and ballad-y. It's very reminiscent to me of the Fugees or something because it just sounds different and very soulful as well." [...] He wrote the song in Jamaica and wanted it to feel rustic and urban. Tinie wanted to [...] "push the envelope" [...] with what you're used to hearing from him and Labrinth. [...] "Lover Not a Fighter" [...] is a feel-good, radio-friendly song that incorporates hip hop and electronic music, along with rap rock, and is about good vibes and [...] "doing your thing". [...] "I'm a lover, not a fighter. I've just come to do my thing and enjoy myself so don't try and get on to me about it or try and make me feel bad about everything that's <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life", said Tinie to SB.TV.|$|E
500|$|... "Stronger" [...] is a dance-pop and electropop {{song with}} {{a length of}} three minutes and 41 seconds. According to the sheet music {{published}} by Hal Leonard Corporation, it {{is set in a}} common time and has a moderately fast tempo of 116 beats per minute. Written in the key of A minor, it follows the chord progression Am–F–C-G/B. Clarkson's vocals span two octaves, from G3 to G5. The song begins with a [...] "rumbling guitar" [...] and a [...] "shimmering synth" [...] riff as Clarkson sings the opening line [...] "You know the bed feels warmer / Sleeping here alone." [...] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard noted that the guitar riff in the verses is reminiscent of Clarkson's [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] which narrates an anthem of personal reinvention, and dancing. The bridges contain pulsating beats with synth and electric guitar that display some elements of electronic sound. During chorus, the song explodes into an upbeat dance-pop number, complete with guitars and electronic drums as Clarkson sings [...] "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger / Stand a little taller / Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone." [...] Jonathan Keefe of Slant felt nobody else could sell the song's [...] "ginormous chorus" [...] better than Clarkson. Lyrically, [...] "Stronger" [...] explores the theme of moving on from an inimical relationship. In an interview, Clarkson remarked that the song doesn't refer to a specific person, stating [...] "I didn't have a bad breakup or anything, I just think life is about relationships so I always write all about these different ones <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life. And I don't have a filter, so it's pretty verbatim." [...] Jason Scott of Blogcritics felt that out of all tracks in Stronger, Clarkson's vocals are best and trendiest in [...] "What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger)".|$|E

Not about what was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life, {{at least in a}} conscious way." [...] He also developed a greater appreciation for pop music, feeling that its multiple disciplines —including lyrics, improvisation, and image —produce a multifaceted art [...] "that moves people and is important, and relevant to our culture in a way that serious classical music isn't right now." [...] In June 2008, he graduated cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in English from Harvard and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Ryan Seacrest, Clarkson stated {{that she and her}} producers strove to record her voice in the album as it is heard at live performances, with as little auto-tune processing as possible, saying [...] "What separates this album are the vocals. They sound richer and fuller, and, for the first time, how I sound when I’m performing live. The producers I worked with just let me sing and be me." [...] Clarkson remarked that [...] "It was a lot of soulful stuff. You know what I'm saying? Like, Radiohead is alternative, but they're very soulful. And Sheryl Crow, very soulful singer-songwriter. So it's all very soulful, rhythmic pop rock." [...] Shortly after the final track listing was revealed, MTV observed that the word [...] "you" [...] featured prominently in the songs' titles. Clarkson asserted [...] "They're all different 'you's'. There's no common, like, it wasn't like one, I didn't have a bad breakup or anything, it wasn't like that.

2500|$|Vana's {{criticism}} of the living conditions that candidates live {{in which they have}} zero contact with outsiders was also brought up a year later by contestant Aleksandra King who left the process in the fourth task, following her departure she said: [...] "I can't tell you in exact detail how much contact I was allowed with my family but, for me, the restricted contact was not good enough. I {{would have liked to have}} picked up the phone and just said, [...] "How are you guys? OK, Great." [...] I was not able to do that. I've got a nine-year-old, a seven-year-old and a five-year-old but it's the work-life balance thing because there are other mums in there who have younger kids and it was OK for them. But for me, I started to get slightly irritated because I felt like why is this even a business tip, what has lack of contact with my family got to do with it? It was winding me up and <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head.' King later remarked that The Apprentice includes a [...] "blame culture" [...] and the atmosphere [...] "wasn't necessarily great for business".|$|E

5000|$|A special 1987 {{issue of}} the Review of Contemporary Fiction, guest edited by Steven Moore, was devoted to a {{critical}} examination of his work. In interviews with Moore in 1985, Brossard said of his work: [...] "I think they can all be understood in a deeply religious sense. I {{think the thing that}} is continuous in this writing of mine is this almost blind religious innocence, of the religious innocent. Now the religious innocent is an inextricable part of religious literature throughout the ages....The believer who believes in miracles persists <b>in</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> <b>In</b> none of <b>my</b> work has the innocent voice lost its innocence.

2500|$|When {{discussion}} regarding {{her second}} album began, Duff {{said she wanted}} to work with the same team of producers and songwriters with whom she worked on Metamorphosis. [...] " [...] made me feel so comfortable and so secure with myself. I loved working with them. I have a great relationship with them. I talk to them ... They knew what was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life, what I was going through ... and how I feel inside", Duff said. For songs she did not co-write, Duff discussed her experiences and feelings with the writers and ask them to write songs about them. Members of the creative team behind Metamorphosis who returned for Hilary Duff include Charlie Midnight, John Shanks and Kara DioGuardi (who collaborated on the commercially released singles), Andre Recke, Marc Swersky and Duff's sister Haylie. Hilary said, [...] "I do have a lot to say, and I have a lot going on inside that sometimes is buried and hidden because I'm working so hard, and I don't have time to think about it. But if we sit down and we talk about it and I tell her how I feel and she writes, it'll be good." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "'I Won't Give Up' {{was written}} selfishly. As {{many of my}} songs are, I write {{for the purpose of}} {{understanding}} what the hell's <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life, my position in the world, processing that lesson and that miracle that I'm learning. Seeing it on the page, proving to myself that I understand the lesson, that I'm applying it to my life, and that I can move on. Ultimately it was about, you know, regardless of what happens in this relationship, I don't have to give up on loving this person, or loving myself, or give up on whatever my dreams are. Even though it's written through the filter of relationships, it's not necessarily specific for relationships. For me, the true meaning exists in the bridge saying 'I don't want to be someone who walks away so easily, I'm here to stay and make a difference.' That is for all of us. We all have something that we're fighting for or that we're striving for. Whether we want to coach our soccer team to victory or lose five pounds in a month, whatever it is, there's nothing too small worth fighting for and there's nothing too big worth going after." ...|$|E

Shit that was really <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> lifestyle, coming from where I come from, the West Coast, the culture out there. Gang banging, drugs, parties, and, just like every other culture, the same shit. It's a lot of gang banging going on. It's shooting going on. It's robbing going on. It's fucking bitches. All that shit." [...] He also said the album would discuss the hardships he faced growing up in Compton. He elaborated to Vibe saying, [...] "Game told it his way, Kendrick told it his way, I’ma tell it my way. That's what it is, and we all from the same city but we're not the same people. We didn't go through everything the exact same ways. Our rapping style is different, so how I’m coming at shit that's finna' be different. You feel me?

The entire structure of the Soviet system lends itself naturally to this limitation...The town and village Soviets, which are directly elected, are municipal authorities whose range of action and methods of work do not greatly differ from those of municipal bodies elsewhere...The atmosphere of a Soviet Election in Moscow is, accordingly, rather nearer to that of an English municipal election than to that of a Parliamentary General Election....The atmosphere of the election and, indeed, of debates in the Soviets themselves, is strangely remote from [...] "politics" [...] as Western democracies conceive them. A big family, animated by a single purpose, sits down on these occasions to administer its common property...The final stage in a Russian Election is the general meeting which adopts the candidates and gives them their mandates...I think that in any event unanimity would have been attained, which, indeed, is the purpose of elections in Russia." ...|$|R
