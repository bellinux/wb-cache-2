40|$|Within {{the past}} few years, {{there has been a}} renewed {{interest}} in reusability as it applies to space flight hardware. Commercial companies such as Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX), Blue Origin, and United Launch Alliance (ULA) are pursuing reusable hardware. Even foreign companies are pursuing this option. The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) launched a reusable space plane technology demonstrator and Airbus Defense and Space is planning to recover the main engines and avionics from its Advanced <b>Expendable</b> <b>Launcher</b> with Innovative engine Economy [1] [2]. To date, the Space Shuttle remains as the only Reusable Launch (RLV) to have flown repeated missions and the Space Shutte Main Engine (SSME) is the only demonstrated reusable engine. Whether the hardware being considered for reuse is a launch vehicle (fully reusable), a first stage (partially reusable), or a booster engine (single component), the overall governing process is the same; it must be recovered and recertified for flight. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} identify the key factors in determining the reusability of flight hardware. This paper begins with defining reusability to set the context, addresses the significance of reuse, and discusses areas that limit successful implementation. Finally, this research identifies the factors that should be considered when incorporating reuse...|$|E

50|$|However, {{commercial}} {{space transportation}} companies {{would be quite}} free to develop the HL-20 and HL-42 designs if they wished; NASA now welcomed commercial participation.

5000|$|<b>Expendable</b> <b>launchers</b> {{generally}} reach GTO directly, but {{a spacecraft}} {{already in a}} low Earth orbit (LEO) can enter GTO by firing a rocket along its orbital direction to increase its velocity.

40|$|This {{research}} on Reusable Launchers {{was motivated by}} the need to reduce substantially the cost of space transportation. The specific objective was to- explore the perception that launcher reusability is the key to achieving these major cost reductions. The exploration was achieved by undertaking a comparative system study on potentially feasible reusable launcher concepts, using a consistent set of design tools, a standard analysis methodology and a standard reference mission. To set the background f or the research, the results of an extensive literature review are 'presented on the vehicle studies and technology developments that are engaged across the world on reusable launchers. Comprehensive vehicle studies appear to be engaged without justification for the choice of selected concepts in the absence of results from comparative system studies of reusable launchers. Technology developments also appear to be engaged without clear links to needs derived from vehicle system studies. The challenge of reusability is then addressed. Firstly, to set the performance and cost targets of reusable launchers, the capabilities of current expendable launchers are derived. Secondly, to establish the operational requirements for reusable launchers, the probable space transportation needs for the early 21 st century are derived. Thirdly, the concepts and characteristics of reusable launchers are derived, allowing the selection, on a rationale basis, of a short-list of 13 potentially feasible reusable launcher concepts for analysis in the research. The performance equations of reusable launchers are 'then derived, leading to the preparation of the comparative analysis tools. The major work-of the research, which ''comprises the performance analysis, technical feasibility assessment and cost"analysis of each candidate vehicle are, then presented and compared-. A set of acceptance requirements for performance,, technical feasibility and operational costs - of reusable launchers is then -derived. The results of the comparative analysis for each candidate launcher are then measured, against these requirements. The results of the comparative analysis show that only 2 of the' 13 candidate reusable launcher concepts are able to meet all the acceptance'requirements. These two acceptable vehicles are both rocket-propelled. They are, ýin order of preference: a single-stage-to-orbit, rocket-propelled, vertical launch and vertical landing vehicle; a two-stage-to-orbit, rocket-propelled, vertical launch and horizontal landing vehicle. The operational ''costs per launch for these two'vehicles,, based on a utilisation plan of 3 vehicles operating for 20 years at a launch rate of 12 launches per year, was calculated to be about 20 % of the current costs of the European Ariane 44 L <b>expendable</b> <b>launcher.</b> This warrants their further evaluation in a thorough feasibility study. The more complex, air-breathing propelled, horizontal launch and landing vehicles were found to be unable to meet the performance, technical feasibility and cost requirements: Several vehicles were found to be unable to deliver a positive payload mass to orbit; Several vehicles were found to have technology requirements that were deemed to be infeasible to achieve; Several vehicles were found to have operational costs ranging from equal to double that -of the European Ariane 44 L <b>expendable</b> <b>launcher,,</b> which -was- adopted as a comparative reference vehicle. The contributions of this research to the advancement of knowledge on reusable launchers are: a clear identification of the performance, capability limits of 13 plausible reusable launcher concepts; an analysis methodology for determining the performance capability limits for any reusable launcher concept; a clear identification of the reasons. for the poor practical performance of air-breathing propulsion systems for Earth-to-orbit launchers, which results from their installed operational characteristics...|$|E
40|$|In 2011 the Space Shuttle, {{the only}} Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) in the world, {{returned}} to earth {{for the final}} time. Upon retirement of the Space Shuttle, the United States (U. S.) no longer possessed a reusable vehicle or the capability to send American astronauts to space. With the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) out of the RLV business and now only pursuing Expendable Launch Vehicles (ELV), not only did companies within the U. S. start to actively pursue the development of either RLVs or reusable components, but entities around the world began to venture into the reusable market. For example, SpaceX and Blue Origin are developing reusable vehicles and engines. The Indian Space Research Organization is developing a reusable space plane and Airbus is exploring the possibility of reusing its first stage engines and avionics housed in the flyback propulsion unit {{referred to as the}} Advanced <b>Expendable</b> <b>Launcher</b> with Innovative engine Economy (Adeline). Even United Launch Alliance (ULA) has announced plans for eventually replacing the Atlas and Delta expendable rockets with a family of RLVs called Vulcan. Reuse can be categorized as either fully reusable, the situation in which the entire vehicle is recovered, or partially reusable such as the National Space Transportation System (NSTS) where only the Space Shuttle, Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), and Solid Rocket Boosters (SRB) are reused. With this influx of renewed interest in reusability for space applications, it is imperative that a systematic approach be developed for assessing the reusability of spaceflight hardware. The partially reusable NSTS offered many opportunities to glean lessons learned; however, when it came to efficient operability for reuse the Space Shuttle and its associated hardware fell short primarily because of its two to four-month turnaround time. Although there have been several attempts at designing RLVs in the past with the X- 33, Venture Star and Delta Clipper Experimental (DC-X), reusability within the spaceflight arena is still in its infancy. With unlimited resources (namely, time and money), almost any launch vehicle and its associated hardware can be made reusable. However, an endless supply of funds for space exploration is not the case in today's economy for neither government agencies nor their commercial counterparts. Therefore, any organization wanting to be a leader in space exploration and remain competitive in this unforgiving space faring industry must confront shrinking budgets with more cost conscious and efficient designs. Therefore, standards for developing reusable spaceflight hardware need to be established. By having standards available to existing and emerging companies, some of the potential roadblocks and limitations that plagued previous attempts at reuse may be minimized or completely avoided...|$|E

A new visionary long-term concept is presented {{that is based on}} the effect of atmospheric/gas pressure. The key issue of this future launch device is a very long evacuated tube called "Space Blast Pipe" (SBP). Initially, the payload is installed on a piston-like platform {{near the bottom of the}} pipe. The tube below the payload is then inflated with atmospheric or higher pressure gas, accelerating the piston with the payload without propellant against the vacuum at the upper side. Depending on tube length, platform diameter, pressure, temperature and payload mass, final velocities in the order of several km/s are possible in theory. Thus, such a device could replace at least the heavy primary stage of a launch system that uses a major pa rt of the propellant.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{environmental}} impact of two types of launch vehicles, an <b>expendable</b> vertical <b>launcher</b> (Delta IV) and a conceptual SSTO spaceplane. A realistic trajectory for the spaceplane is generated using a multiple-shooting trajectory optimisation method, which integrates physical models and generates an optimal control law minimising the fuel consumption and the emissions of the flight. These were compared with the emissions from a standard Delta IV trajectory. The launch was to a 200 km circular LEO at 27. 5 ° inclination. The chemical investigated is H 2 O, which contributes to the depletion of the ozone layer in the stratosphere. The study shows that for the ascent trajectory the spaceplane produces a total of 5. 0143 x 105 kg of H 2 O, compared with 2. 24 x 105 kg for the Delta IV.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of any launch vehicle {{is to bring}} as much payload to space as possible. Space planes have been studied for decades, as they {{are thought to be}} more cost {{effective}} for frequent access to space than traditional <b>expendable</b> <b>launchers.</b> This research aims at optimizing the payload capacity of a single stage to orbit (SSTO) horizontal take-off horizontal landing (HTHL) space plane, by flying a minimum fuel an heat load trajectory. Trajectory optimization of launch vehicles is traditionally performed with local optimization methods. The objective of this research is to find a good approach to optimize the ascent trajectory with a global optimizer. To achieve this goal, a simulation model is set up. This model propagates the ascent trajectory based on a guided angle of attack and throttle setting {{as a function of the}} normalized energy state of the vehicle. The guidance parameters are defined at a number of control nodes and are stored in a decision vector. This vector is randomly initialized and subsequently optimized. The performance of different optimization methods and problem settings is assessed based on the convergence of the optimized populations with respect to a set of evaluation objectives. Specifically multi-objective (MO) global optimizers were selected for this research. The performance of MOEA/D, NSGA-II and NSGA-II-tabu was compared. MOEA/D was found to give the most consistent result and fastest convergence. Different combinations of control parameters were used. The use of thrust-vector control improved the convergence and the quality of the results, as long as the problem dimension was not over-sized. Also various approaches for constraint and objective handling were evaluated. As the objectives and constraints were highly conflicting, a penalty function had to be included to reduce the sensitivity to premature convergence to no-flying solutions. The resulting set up was not able to find a solution for the complete trajectory. The trajectory was therefore split in three phases: take-off, acceleration and pull-up. The first two stages were optimized successfully and resulted in similar payload capacities as found in the literature with traditional methods. The final pull-up stage needs to be further investigated. Although this research has shown that global optimizers can be used for the ascent trajectory optimization, further research is required before the methods can be applied effectively...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{propellants}} produced at the points of destination such as the Moon or Mars will help the economy of space transportation, particularly if round trips with a crew are involved. The construction and operation of a lunar base shortly {{after the turn of the}} century is one of the space programs under serious consideration at the present time. Space transportation is one of the major cost drivers. With present technology, if <b>expendable</b> <b>launchers</b> were employed, the specific transportation costs of one-way cargo flights would be approximately 10, 000 dollars/kg (1985) at life-cycle cumulative 100, 000 ton payload to the lunar surface. A fully reusable space transportation system using lunar oxygen and Earth-produced liquid hydrogen (LH 2) would reduce the specific transportation costs by one order of magnitude to less than 1000 dollars/kg at the same payload volume. Another case of primary interest is the delivery of construction material and consumables from the lunar surface to the assembly site of space solar power plants in geostationary orbit (GEO). If such a system were technically and economically feasible, a cumulative payload of about 1 million tons or more would be required. At this level a space freighter system could deliver this material from Earth for about 300 dollars/kg (1985) to GEO. A lunar space transportation system using lunar oxygen and a fuel mixture of 50 percent Al and 50 percent LH 2 (that has to come from Earth) could reduce the specific transportation costs to less than half, approximately 150 dollars/kg. If only lunar oxygen were available, these costs would come down to 200 dollars/kg. This analysis indicates a sizable reduction of the transportation burden on this type of mission. It should not be overlooked, however, that there are several uncertainties in such calculations. It is quite difficult at this point to calculate the cost of lunar-produced O and/or Al. This will be a function of production rate and life-cycle length. In quoting any cost of this nature, it is very important to state the cumulative transportation volume, since this is a very sensitive parameter. Nevertheless, cost models must be developed now to understand fully the interdependencies of a large number of parameters and to provide the best possible data for planning purposes. Without such data, mission modes and vehicle designs or sizes cannot be selected intelligently...|$|R
