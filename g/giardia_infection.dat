Asymptomatic <b>Giardia</b> <b>infections</b> persisted as long as 4 months, with a mean duration of excretion of 7. 18 weeks. The incidence of asymptomatic infection was 4. 5 episodes per child-year. Exclusively breast-fed infants had lower risk for asymptomatic (odds ratio [OR] 0. 66, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 45 – 0. 96, P 0. 05) and symptomatic infections (relative risk [RR] 0. 50, 95 % CI 0. 27 – 0. 90, P 0. 05). Furthermore, breast-fed infants had fewer clinical manifestations, including mucus in stool (23. 8 % versus 76. 2 %, P 0. 08), loss of appetite (17. 6 % versus 82. 3 %, P 0. 05), and abdominal tenderness (17 % versus 82. 9 %, P 0. 05) compared with infants who were not exclusively breast-fed.

25|$|Giardia {{alternates}} {{between two}} different formsa hardy, dormant cyst that contaminates water or food, and an active, disease-causing form that emerges after the parasite is ingested. Dr. Frances Gillin of the University of California, San Diego {{and her colleagues}} cultivated the entire life cycle of this parasite in the laboratory, and identified biochemical cues in the host's digestive system which trigger Giardias life cycle transformations. They also uncovered several {{ways in which the}} parasite evades the defences of the infected organism.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Giardia duodenalis {{infection}} and malnutrition are still considered as public health problems {{in many developing}} countries especially among children in rural communities. This study was carried out among Aboriginal (Orang Asli) primary schoolchildren in rural peninsular Malaysia to investigate the burden and the effects of <b>Giardia</b> <b>infection</b> on growth (weight and height) of the children. METHODS/FINDINGS: Weight and height of 374 children aged 7 - 12 years were assessed before and after treatment of <b>Giardia</b> <b>infection.</b> The children were screened for Giardia parasite using trichrome staining technique. Demographic and socioeconomic data were collected via face-to-face interviews using a pre-tested questionnaire. Overall, 22. 2 % (83 / 374) of the children were found to be infected with Giardia. Nutritional status of children was assessed and the results showed that the mean weight and height were 23. 9 kg (95 % CI =  23. 3, 24. 5) and 126. 6 cm (95 % CI =  125. 6, 127. 5), respectively. Overall, the prevalence of severe underweight, stunting and wasting were 28. 3 %, 23. 8 % and 21. 0 %, respectively. Multiple linear regression analyses showed sex, <b>Giardia</b> <b>infection</b> and household monthly income as the significant determinants of weight while sex and level of mother's education were the significant determinants of height. Weight and height were assessed at 3 and 6 months after treatment of <b>Giardia</b> <b>infection.</b> It was found that <b>Giardia</b> <b>infection</b> has a significant association with the weight of children but not with height.

40|$|Two major {{genotypic}} assemblages of Giardia lamblia infect humans; the epidemiologic {{significance of}} this phenomenon is poorly understood. We developed a single-vessel multiplex real-time PCR (qPCR) assay that genotypes <b>Giardia</b> <b>infections</b> into assemblages A and/or B directly from fecal samples. The assay utilized Scorpion probes that combined genotype-specific primers and probes for the 18 S rRNA gene into the same molecule. The protocol was capable of detecting as few as 20 trophozoites per PCR on fecal DNA isolated using a commercial method or 1. 25 trophozoites per PCR on fecal DNA isolated using a G. lamblia-specific oligo-nucleotide capture technique. The assay was specific for fecal specimens, with no amplification of the discor-dant genotype with the opposite Scorpion probe. When 97 clinical specimens from Bangladesh were used, the multiplex PCR assay detected 95 % (21 of 22) of Giardia microscopy-positive specimens and 18 % (13 of 74) of microscopy-negative specimens.

Fresh fecal samples were collected from 386 male and female Holstein calves (newborn to 24 wk) in 20 dairies located in the lower Fraser river valley area of British Columbia. Giardia intestinalis, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Cryptosporidium muris were enumerated in each sample after concentration by sucrose gradient centrifugation and immunofluorescent staining. Giardia was identified at all farm locations. The overall prevalence of Giardia in calves was 73 % with a geometric mean cyst count of 1180 cysts per gram of feces (CI, 41 to 5014). Cryptosporidium parvum and C. muris were identified in 80 % and 40 % of the farms, respectively. The prevalence of C. parvum was 59 %, and the geometric mean for oocysts was 457 oocysts per gram of feces (CI, 18 to 160). The prevalence of C. muris was only 2 % and the mean oocyst counts were 54 oocysts per gram of feces.

We studied the epidemiological characteristics of symptomatic <b>Giardia</b> <b>infections</b> acquired in Germany and abroad, and verified the proportion of cases acquired in Germany in order to investigate risk factors for sporadic autochthonous <b>Giardia</b> <b>infections.</b> Methods We identified Giardia cases notified by 41 local health authorities between February 2007 and January 2008 and interviewed them on their clinical symptoms, underlying morbidities, travel abroad and potential risk factors for the disease. We conducted a case-control-study including laboratory-confirmed (microscopy or antigen-test) autochthonous Giardia cases with clinical manifestations (diarrhoea, cramps, bloating) and randomly selected controls from the local population registry matched by county of residence and age-group (0 - 5, 6 - 19, ≥ 20 years). Secondary cases, controls with diarrhoea and persons who had travelled outside Germany in the three weeks prior to disease onset (exposure period) were excluded. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) using conditional logistic regression. Results Of 273 interviewed cases, 131 (48 %) had not travelled abroad during the defined exposure period. Of these 131, 85 (65 %) were male, 68 (54 %) were living in communities with > 100, 000 inhabitants and 107 (83 %) were aged 20 years or older. We included 120 cases and 240 controls in the case-control study. Cases {{were more likely to}} be male (aOR 2. 5 CI 1. 4 - 4. 4), immunocompromised (aOR 15. 3 CI 1. 8 - 127) and daily consumers of green salad (aOR 2. 9 CI 1. 2 - 7. 2). Contact with animals (pets/farm animals) and exposure to surface water (swimming/water sports) were not associated with symptomatic disease. Conclusions A substantial proportion of Giardia lamblia cases in Germany are indigenously acquired. Symptomatic cases are significantly more likely to be immunocompromised than control persons from the general population. Physicians should consider <b>Giardia</b> <b>infections</b> among patients with no recent history of travel abroad, particularly if they have immune deficiencies. Green salads may be an important vehicle of infection. Information campaigns highlighting this food-borne risk should emphasise the risk to persons with immune deficiencies. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPersistence of {{giardiasis}} {{after some}} of the recommended drugs is occurring with increasing frequency. We describe the follow-up of four members of a family with giardiasis through microscopic observation, immunochromatography and PCRs of tpi and β-giardin genes. Three patients {{did not respond to}} tinidazole but they were cured after quinacrine. However, PCR became negative at 2 months after negativization of stools in two patients and after 1 year in one patient. In all cases Giardia assemblage B was characterized with high homology between all isolates. Further studies are needed to determine the value of PCR in the diagnosis of <b>Giardia</b> <b>infections...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Person-to-person {{transmission}} {{accounts for}} the majority of <b>Giardia</b> <b>infections</b> and is usually associated with poor hygiene and sanitation. Giardia is found {{on the surface of the}} ground, in the soil, in undercooked foods, and in water, and on hands without proper cleaning after handling infected feces. [...] Water-borne transmission is associated with the ingestion of contaminated water. In the U.S., outbreaks typically occur in small water systems using inadequately treated surface water. Venereal transmission happens through fecal-oral contamination. Additionally, diaper changing and inadequate hand washing are risk factors for transmission from infected children. Lastly, food-borne epidemics of Giardia have developed through the contamination of food by infected food-handlers.|$|R
