40|$|ABSTRACT:The {{effect of}} <b>European</b> black <b>alder</b> (Alnus glutinosa L.) on the {{contents}} of carbon and nitrogen, exchangeable base cations, and plant available forms of phosphorus in the reclaimed mine soils formed by waste deposition from opencast lignite mines was researched in central Serbia. It was concluded that the greatest part of dead organic residues reaching the soil under <b>European</b> black <b>alder</b> monocultures was liable to rapid decomposition into end products. This was the consequence of a narrow C/N ratio in the <b>European</b> black <b>alder</b> litterfall which amounted on average to 12. 77 in the study monocultures. Only {{a small part of}} organic residues was transformed into humus. On that account, <b>European</b> black <b>alder</b> monocultures did not {{have a major impact on}} the accumulation of organic carbon and total nitrogen in the soil. The content of carbon in the surface layers accounted for 1. 55 - 1. 57 %, and the content of nitrogen to 0. 085 - 0. 132 %. Fast mineralisation of organic matter, and thus also of the organic forms of nitrogen, resulted in the surplus of soil nitrates, which were liable to washing through the soil. Nitrate movement resulted in the soil leaching and the movement of base cations, primarily calcium, to the deeper layers of the solum. The total soil phosphorus content was low, and also the level of plant available forms. A significant portion of total phosphorus in the surface layers of the reclaimed mine soils was composed of its organic forms...|$|R

40|$|Physiological {{effects of}} two tree growth {{regulators}} (TGRs), flurprimidol and paclobutrazol, on eleven species located in Indiana and Louisiana were studied. Five experiments were designed with mature trees, saplings, seedlings, or isolated mitochondria to investigate effects of TGRs on wound healing, cambial growth, vegetative growth of progeny seedlings, and electron transport by leaf mitochondria. Species investigated were: Quercus rubra L., Q. alba L., Q. falcata var. pagodaefolia Elliott, Juglans nigra L., Alnus glutinosa L., Liquidambar styraciflua L., Fraxinus americana L., Pinus strobus L., P. taeda L., Liriodendron tulipifera L., and Platanus occidentalis L. ^ Closure of bark wounds was reduced in paclobutrazol-treated white oak, red oak, sweetgum, black walnut and white ash in Indiana, and sweetgum and cherrybark oak in Louisiana. There {{was no difference}} in bark wound closure between treated and untreated <b>European</b> black <b>alder,</b> yellow poplar, white pine, or American sycamore. Closure of pruning wounds was reduced in white oak, red oak, sweetgum, <b>European</b> black <b>alder,</b> and black walnut in Indiana, and sweetgum and cherrybark oak in Louisiana. The inhibitory effect on closure of both bark and pruning wounds in some species persists at least three or four years. TGRs were transported to developing seeds of silver maple and reduced growth of the progeny when the seeds were collected one month after treatment. The growth of progeny seedlings was enhanced when seeds were collected one year after treatment and was not affected when seeds were collected two years after treatment with TGRs. ^ The effect of paclobutrazol on cambial growth, annual shoot growth, and total tree height growth varied with species and treatment duration. Paclobutrazol reduced cambial growth in white oak, red oak, cherrybark oak, sweetgum, <b>European</b> black <b>alder,</b> and white pine with the effect varying among species, vertical location of the cross-section, and years after treatment. ^ TGRs accumulated in seeds of treated <b>European</b> black <b>alder</b> and silver maple reduced or stimulated electron transport in leaf mitochondria of the progeny seedlings.

40|$|Detached {{roots and}} nodules of the N 2 -fixing species, Albus glutinosa (<b>European</b> black <b>alder),</b> {{actively}} assimilate CO 2. The maximum rates of dark CO 2 fixation observed for detached nodules and roots were 15 and 3 micromoles CO 2 fixed per gram dry weight per hour, respectively. The net incorporation of CO 2 in these tissues was catalyzed by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase which produces organic acids, {{some of which}} are used in the synthesis of the amino acids, aspartate, glutamate, and citrulline and by carbamyl phosphate synthetase. The latter accounts for approximately 30 to 40 % of the CO 2 fixed and provides carbamyl phosphate for the synthesis of citrulline. Results of labeling studies suggest that there are multiple pools of malate present in nodules. The major pool is apparently metabolically inactive and of unknown function while the smaller pool is rapidly utilized in the synthesis of amino acids. Dark CO 2 fixation and N 2 fixation in nodules decreased after treatment of nodulated plants with nitrate while the percentage of the total 14 C incorporated into organic acids increased. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and carbamyl phosphate synthetase play key roles in the synthesis of amino acids including citrulline and in the metabolism of N 2 -fixing nodules and roots of alder...|$|R

40|$|Studies of {{perennial}} plants generally {{search for a}} seed size vs. seed number trade-off. Surprisingly, the fact that perennials may replace an investment in large seeds by the allocation to vegetative propagation {{has not yet been}} investigated as an additional pathway enabling species coexistence. We focused on the mechanisms of coexistence in Carex elata and C. elongata, two co-occurring clonal sedges dominant in <b>European</b> swamp <b>alder</b> forests. We asked the following questions: i) Is the number of germinated seeds a better predictor of species coexistence than the total number of seeds? ii) What recruitment conditions and competition rules determine vegetative sprouting to be an alternative to large, competitively superior seeds? We measured several species functional traits related to the colonisation and fitness of perennials. To examine the competitive hierarchy between species and microsite species preferences, we analysed the effects of environmental factors and plant densities on fitness-related traits using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). Then, using a series of spatially explicit simulations partly parameterised based on the field measurement, we evaluated the importance of seed and ramet propagation and recruitment conditions for long-term species coexistence. SEM indicated a competitive hierarchy and a large overlap in microsite preferences between species. As a response to our initial questions we found that: i) Only differences in the numbers of germinated seeds, allowed the two species to coexist. If we consider only differences in the total number of seeds, the superior competitor (Carex elata) outcompeted the inferior competitor (C. elongata) in all scenarios. This is because the former produced about three-times as many seeds as the latter. ii) We show that vegetative sprouting represents an additional pathway for the seed size-number trade-off when the competitive superiority of species is attributed to vegetative propagation. This is another way that a species deals with the omnipresent seeds of other species. Taken together, our study demonstrates that differences in seed performance, coupled with differences in vegetative propagation related to competitive ability, are an additional mechanism allowing the coexistence of {{perennial plants}}...|$|R

40|$|The article {{presents}} results of {{study of the}} isotope composition and pollen spectra of atmospheric precipitation and ice taken from marginal parts of Korumdu Glacier (North-Chu Ridge, the Altai Mountains). The study was aimed at identification of sources and ways of precipitation into the nival-glacial region of Altai. Investigation of the isotope composition of ice taken from the tongue of the Korumdu Glacier and summer precipitation in its basin has shown that here the isotope concentrations are much smaller than similar ones of the cold Belukha Glacier. The last one is located near the Korumdu Glacier. This difference {{can be explained by}} the fact that main source of moisture forming layers of relatively warm Korumdu Glacier is precipitation of the cold season while accumulation on the cold Belukha Glacier proceeds during the whole year mainly due to the most heavy precipitation of warm (from March to November) season. Analysis of the isotope composition and the air mass trajectories on the day of July 16, 2013 allowed conclusion that the air masses started their way in the Baltic Sea region and moved mainly along middle latitudes. On this way they underwent insignificant isotope fractionation. Synoptic analysis had shown that the main reason of precipitation on the area under investigation was a front of occlusion over the Altai. In addition, results of palynological analysis of precipitation allow identification sources of pollen in this region.

40|$|The {{research}} {{reported in}} this thesis deals with the symbiosis of Frankia spp. and Alnus glutinosa. Frankia spp. are actinomycetes giving rise {{to the formation of}} nitrogen-fixing nodules on the roots of a number of non-leguminous plants. In these nodules Frankia spp. live within the plant cells and obtain all sources of carbon and energy from the plant, giving fixed nitrogen in exchange. To answer the question what compounds Frankia spp. obtain from the plant, insight into the metabolism of this microorganism is required. To obtain this insight, researches have been made with the free-living Frankia AvcI 1, isolated from root nodules of Alnus viridis ssp crispa by Baker et al. (1979). This organism has been isolated and cultivated on complex media. In order to obtain insight into the C- and N-source requirements of Frankia AvcI 1, a simple and well-defined growth medium is needed. The composition of this medium and the C- and N-metabolism of Frankia AvcI 1 are the subjects of Chapter II of this thesis. In Chapter II. 1 it is shown that Frankia AvcI 1 is able to grow on a medium containing Tween 80 (an oleate ester of polyethyleneglycol sorbitan) as sole C-source and either glutamic acid or NH 4 Cl as sole N-source. The growth yield of Frankia AvcI 1 on various media is reported. It is shown that the doubling time of Frankia AvcI 1 growing on QMOD/Tween medium is about 2 days, which is slow, even for an actinomycete. When growing with Casamino acids as nitrogen source, Frankia AvcI 1 selectively takes up glutamic acid and aspartic acid, leaving the concentrations of the other detectable amino acids unchanged. The mechanism of this selection is still unclear. Chapter II. 2 contains further data on the C-sources utilized by Frankia AvcI 1 It is shown that Frankia AvcI 1 can utilize as C-source also other Tweens, viz. Tweens 20, 40, 60 and 85, and in addition several fatty acids, viz. acetic, propionic, butyric, valeric, caproic, caprylic, capric, palmitic and stearic acids. No growth of Frankia AvcI 1 was observed on media containing triglycerides as C-sources. The dependence of the growth yield {{on the nature of the}} carbon source and the concentration of NH 4 + in the media is shown. Utilization of NH 4 + as nitrogen source of Frankia AvcI 1 growing in the Tween/NH 4 + medium is confirmed by incorporation experiments with 15 N-NH 4 Cl. The results reported in Chapter II. 3 show that Frankia AvcI 1 does not take up glucose from a medium containing both glucose and Tween 80. In agreement with this observation, it is demonstrated that the activities of isocitrate lyase and malate synthase in cells grown on the QMOD/Tween medium (containing both glucose and Tween 80) are of the same order ofmagnitude as in cells grown on the Tween/NH 4 + medium (containing Tween 80 as sole C-source). Organisms growing on fatty acids, and degrading these compounds to acetyl-CoA, start gluconeogenesis with the action of the glyoxylate cycle (Kornberg and Krebs, 1957) leading to the conversion of 2 acetyl-CoA molecules to 1 molecule of succinate. The presence of the glyoxylate cycle enzymes isocitrate lyase and malate synthase in Frankia AvcI 1 cells grown with Tween 80 as C-source is therefore not surprising. The succinate formed in the glyoxylate cycle can be converted to phosphoenolpyruvate by the subsequent action of the enzymes succinate dehydrogenase, fumarase, malic enzyme and pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase, which are found in cell-free extracts of Frankia AvcI 1 From phosphoenolpyruvate, gluconeogenesis can continue with the action of phosphoglycerate kinase and 3 -phosphoglyceraldehyde dehydrogenase. For energy generation, Frankia AvcI 1 can oxidize the acetyl-CoA derived from fatty acid breakdown in the citric acid cycle, although the low activity of the enzyme succinyl-CoA synthetase leaves room for the presumption that the citric acid cycle is not very operative in Frankia AvcI 1 This is not impossible since the oxidation of fatty acids yields many reducing equivalents. The data contained in Chapter II. 4 show that Frankia AvcI 1 does not take up succinate from a medium containing acetate plus succinate or succinate alone. In accordance, no repressing effect of succinate on the activities of the glyoxylate cycle enzymes was observed, whereas in cells grown on propionate these enzymes were not found, indicating that they are hot constitutive in Frankia AvcI 1 Frankia AvcI 1 is able to utilize several amino acids as sole nitrogen source, viz. alanine, γ-aminobutyric acid, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine, leucine, phenylalanine, serine, threonine, tyrosine and valine. No differences in C- and N-source requirements were observed for the three Frankia strains AvcI 1, CPI 1 (isolated by Callaham et al., 1978, from Comptonia peregrina root nodules) and AgSp+ 1 (isolated by Quispel and Burggraaf, 1981, from Alnus glutinosa spore-(+) type root nodules). These three strains were shown to utilize either Tween 80 or acetate, but no ethanol, lactate, glucose or succinate as sole C-source, and either NH 4 Cl, Casamino acids, aspartic acid or alanine as N-source. From the data given in Chapter II it will be clear that Frankia AvcI 1 is able to grow on a well-defined medium, which is a prerequisite for obtaining a clear insight into the physiology of the organism. The alcoholic root extract (Quispel and Tak, 1978) or the soybean lecithin (Lalonde and Calvert, 1979), added to the medium as growth factors, can be replaced by Tween 80 or fatty acids which are utilized as carbon source, while NH 4 Cl or amino acids can be utilized as nitrogen source. It is unknown whether Frankia spp. grow with the same growth rate on media with different constituents. The growth yields presented in Chapter II are usually small as compared to the amount of carbon present in the media. This suggests that either an additional component of the medium is present in limiting concentrations or that Frankia spp. can only grow for a limited time after inoculation. The only group of compounds known so far to be utilized as C-source by free-living Frankia AvcI 1 are fatty acids, either free or esterified. The question what carbon source Frankia spp. living symbiotically in the nodule obtain from the plant, still remains to be answered. Based on the data obtained for free-living Frankia spp. it is not unlikely that some fatty acid functions as C-source under such conditions. Other possible candidates for this function are plant lipids like the alcoholic root extract (Quispel and Tak, 1978) or the soybean lecithin (Lalonde and Calvert, 1979). It is unlikely that sugars like glucose or dicarboxylic acids like succinate are playing this role, unless the ability of Frankia spp. to take up one or more of these compounds should alter during the transition from the free-living to the symbiotic stage. The cultivation of free-living Frankia spp. is a powerful tool in discovering symbiotic interactions of the endophyte and the host. In Chapter II. 4 of this thesis it is shown that by replacing acetate as C-source of the medium by propionate, the activities of the glyoxylate cycle enzymes are repressed. Other authors (Tjepkema, Ormerod and Torrey, 1980 and 1981, Gauthier, Diem and Dommergues, 1981) reported a medium in which free-living Frankia spp. show vesicle formation and N 2 -ase activity. The present knowledge thus enables one to influence regulation in freeliving Frankia spp., which is important in studying the symbiotic interactions mentioned above. In Chapter III attention is paid to the assimilation of the ammonia produced by the endophyte living symbiotically in the root nodules of Alnus glutinosa grown in the greenhouse from seeds collected in Wageningen. In Chapter III. 1 the composition of the pool of free amino acids in root nodules and the xylem tissue of stems is reported. It is shown that citrulline is the predominant free amino acid in nodules, while serine also occurs in relatively large amounts. In xylem tissue citrulline and glutamic acid are prominent. The activities of N 2 -ase, GS, GDH and OCT in root nodule homogenates are reported. From the K m values of GDH for NH 4 + (16 mM) and glutamate (0. 9 mM) and the concentrations in the nodule of NH 4 + (1. 5 mM) and glutamate (0. 5 mM) it is concluded that GDH in alder nodules probably is responsible for the deamination of glutamate and not for the synthesis of this key amino acid. The important function of GDH in the nitrogen metabolism of alder nodules is confirmed by the much higher activity of this enzyme in homogenates of nodules as compared to that in homogenates of root-tips and leaves. The vesicle clusters, which contain the N 2 -ase activity, did not show activity of GS, GDH and OCT. The cytoplasm of the host cells was shown to possess the GS activity, while GDH and OCT are localized in the organelles of the host cells. No activity of NADH-dependent GOGAT was observed. In Chapter 111. 2 it is shown that the activity of NADH-dependent GOGAT from root nodules of lupins is inhibited by some compound in the homogenate of alder nodules. Simultaneously with and independently of the present research, Schubert et al. (1981) analyzed the composition of the pool of free amino acids in nodules and the xylem tissue of Alnus glutinosa grown in the field in East Lansing, Michigan. The only difference with respect to these amino acid pools between the American <b>alders</b> and the <b>European</b> <b>alders</b> studied in the present research, is the relatively high amount of serine in nodules of the latter, whereas in nodules of the former this amino acid is not found. The results of both Schubert et al. (1981) and the present research confirm the hypothesis that in alder,citrulline is the main transport vehicle of fixed nitrogen (Miettienen and Virtanen, 1952; Leaf, Gardner and Bond, 1958; Wheeler and Bond, 1970). From the results shown in Chapter 111. 2 it can be concluded that our failure to find any GOGAT activity may be ascribed to the presence of an inhibiting compound in the homogenate of alder nodules, so that it is not excluded that GOGAT is active in alder nodules in vivo. The data reported in Chapter III are in accordance with the following model: The nitrogen fixed as ammonia in the vesicle clusters of the endophyte, is assimilated in the cytoplasm of the host cell into glutamate by the action of GS and presumably GOGAT. Glutamate is in part deaminated in the plant organelles by the action of GDH to supply the NH 4 + required for the synthesis of carbamyl phosphate. Another part of the glutamate is converted to ornithine, which in the organelles of the host cellreacts with carbamyl phosphate to form citrulline according to the OCT reaction. Citrulline is excreted from the nodule and serves as nitrogen source for the plant. ...|$|R

40|$|In Italy some {{agricultural}} {{areas have been}} planted with high value hardwood mixed plantations (mainly walnut or cherry trees) realized with a technique that provides benefits also {{for the presence of}} accessory species. The purpose of this work is to study intermediate cutting operations in mixed plantations. Two different plantations of walnut (with poplar and other fitting trees), situated in Lombardia region (Northern Italy), were investigated. In Casal Buttano plantation walnut has a planting distance of 10 x 14 m and it is combined with poplar (5 x 14 m distance). Between the two species there are two shrub rows (cob hazel and elder) and a common <b>European</b> <b>alder</b> row. In walnut rows, the main species is alternated with Eleagnus umbellata shrubs. In San Matteo delle Chiaviche plantation the planting distance between trees is 3 x 3. 5 m. Trees species are walnut, poplar, common <b>European</b> <b>alder</b> and a shrub (Eleagnus umbellata). During intermediate cutting operation poplar needs to be felled providing no damages to standing walnuts. Because of the different distance between species in the two stands, different logging methods were needed. Time studies were carried out to analyse two different logging methods. In Casal Buttano plantation cob hazel shrubs were cut with a cutting-chipper machine that provided biomass for heating. During poplar logging an operator with chainsaw felled the trees assisted by an excavator equipped with a loading grapple; the trees were then forwarded on a tractor bunk. In San Matteo delle Chiaviche plantation a chainsaw operator felled poplar in the right direction supported by an operator with felling lever; the trees were skidded by tractors. Productivity and costs of the two methods were calculated. Both adopted logging methods did not cause any damage to the standing walnuts. First method might be suitable when rows of poplar and walnuts are separated by an accessory species row, in order to avoid damages caused by the excavator. Second method is advisable in stands where rows of poplar and walnuts are adjacent, without any accessory species in the middle...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{compared}} autumn decomposition {{rates of}} <b>European</b> <b>alder</b> leaves at four sites along the Lasset–Hers River system, southern France, {{to test whether}} changes in litter decomposition rates from upstream (1, 300 m elevation) to downstream (690 m) {{could be attributed to}} temperature-driven differences in microbial growth, shredder activity, or composition of the shredder community. Alder leaves lost 75 – 87 % of original mass in 57 days, of which 46 – 67 % could be attributed to microbial metabolism and 8 – 29 % to shredder activity, with no trend along the river. Mass loss rates in both fine-mesh (excluding shredders) and coarse-mesh (including shredders) bags were faster at warm, downstream sites (mean daily temperature 7 – 8 °C) than upstream (mean 1 – 2 °C), but the differ- ence disappeared when rates were expressed in heat units to remove the temperature effect. Mycelial biomass did not correlate with mass loss rates. Faster mass loss rates upstream, after temperature correction, evidently arise from more efficient shredding by Nemourid stoneflies than by the Leuctra-dominated assemblage downstream. The influence of water temperature on decomposition rate is therefore expressed both directly, through microbial metabolism, and indirectly, through the structure of shredder commu- nities. These influences are evident even in cold water where temperature variation is small...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Mycorrhizal fungi form {{intimate}} {{associations with}} their host plants that constitute their carbon resource and habitat. Alnus spp. (Betulaceae) {{are known to}} host an exceptional species-poor and specialized ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal community compared to other tree species, but the host-specificity pattern and its significance in terms of fungal diversification and speciation remain poorly documented. The degree of parallel speciation, host switching, and patterns of biogeography were explored in the historical associations between alders and three ECM taxa of Basidiomycetes: Alnicola (Agaricales), Alpova (Boletales), and Lactarius (Russulales). The aim was to develop an evolutionary framework on host specificity and diversification of Basidiomycetes in this highly specialized plant-fungus symbiosis. Results Sporocarps of Alnicola (220), Lactarius (61) and Alpova (29) were collected from stands of the four <b>European</b> <b>alder</b> species (A. alnobetula including the endemic subsp. suaveolens in Corsica, A. cordata, A. glutinosa, A. incana) in Western Europe (mainly in France and Austria), from 1995 to 2009. Specimens were morphologically identified to the species level. From these, 402 sequences of four DNA regions (ITS, rpb 2, gpd, and the V 9 domain of the mit-SSU rDNA) were successfully obtained and analyzed in addition with 89 sequences available in GenBank and UNITE databases. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted on all sequence data sets (individual and combined) using maximum likelihood reconstruction and Bayesian inference. Fungal phylogenies are compared and discussed {{in relation to the}} host, with a focus on species boundaries by associating taxonomic, systematic and molecular information. Conclusions Patterns of host specificity and phylogenies of Alnicola and Lactarius suggest coevolution as a basal factor of speciation in relation with the subgeneric diversification of Alnus, possibly due to the very selective pressure of the host. A second element of the historical associations between Alnus and its fungal symbionts is a host-dependent speciation (radiation without host change), here observed in Alnicola and Alpova in relation with Alnus subgen. Alnus. Finally host shifts from Alnus subgen. Alnus to A. alnobetula are found in most lineages of Alnicola (at least four times), Alpova (twice) and Lactarius (once), but they do not represent such a common event as could be expected by geographic proximity of trees from the two subgenera. However, active or very recent host extensions clearly occurred in Corsica, where some fungi usually associated with Alnus glutinosa on mainland Europe locally extend there to A. alnobetula subsp. suaveolens without significant genetic or morphological deviation. </p...|$|E
