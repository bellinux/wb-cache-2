5|$|The split and, due to {{the open}} letter's allegations, Turunen's {{character}} {{became the subject of}} close media coverage. Turunen responded through an open letter on her website and through some interviews in which she explained her view. She was upset that after nine years of working together, Holopainen announced the separation via an open letter. Because of the continuing media interest, Marcelo Cabuli posted a message addressing the situation on the website in February 2006. He asked that anyone who had questions should email him. In June 2006, Cabuli posted a lengthy reply to many of the questions he had received. He answered questions related to the greed accusation by explaining that the band had agreed on the distribution of earnings in a contract at the formation of Nightwish. Based on that contract, every band member got a <b>fixed</b> <b>share</b> of 20% of the band's income. Marcelo Cabuli stated that, unlike others, Turunen had never fought for additional songwriter royalties.|$|E
25|$|All {{indicators}} {{paint the}} same picture. Some 41% of Brazilian PhDs were granted by {{universities in the}} State of São Paulo in 2012 and 44% of all papers with Brazilian authors {{have at least one}} author from an institution based in São Paulo. São Paulo’s scientific productivity (390 papers per million inhabitants over 2009–2013) is twice the national average (184), a differential which has been widening in recent years. The relative impact of publications by scientists from the State of São Paulo has also been systematically higher than for Brazil as a whole over the past decade. Two key factors explain São Paulo’s success in scientific output: firstly, a well-funded system of state universities, including the University of São Paulo, University of Campinas (Unicamp) and the State University of São Paulo, all of which have been included in international university rankings;10 secondly, the role played by the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP). Both the university system and FAPESP are allocated a <b>fixed</b> <b>share</b> of the state’s sales tax revenue as their annual budgets and have full autonomy as to the use they make of this revenue.|$|E

This is an alternative to creating a <b>fixed</b> <b>sharing</b> of a link, such as in general time division multiplexing (TDM) and frequency division multiplexing (FDM).

40|$|This paper derives {{observable}} properties of economies with optimal income distribution rules that specify consumers' incomes as functions of aggregate income and prices. Optimality {{implies that the}} aggregate demand function is generated by a single 'representative' consumer. The author derives an additional implication which, when consumers receive <b>fixed</b> <b>shares</b> of aggregate income, requires that the consumers' demands become more dispersed when aggregate income rises. This last condition has empirical support. The results relate the representative consumer's preferences to a version of Kaldor's compensation criterion and show when both {{can be used for}} normative analysis without internal inconsistency.
