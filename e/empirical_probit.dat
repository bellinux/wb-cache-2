40|$|In {{this paper}} we revisit various {{important}} {{issues relating to}} practical estimation of the multinomial probit model, using an empirical analysis of car ownership as a test case. To provide context, a brief literature review of <b>empirical</b> <b>probit</b> studies is included. Estimates are obtained for {{a full range of}} model specifications, including models with random (uncorrelated and correlated) taste variation and/or a general random error structure, and issues of estimability, specification testing, and alternative normalizations for probit models are addressed. Three model trust region algorithms for finding maximum likelihood estimates are compared, and the superiority of a structured quasi-Newton method employing "model switching" over more traditional approaches (Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno secant update, Berndt-Hall-Hall-Hausman) is demonstrated. The trust region algorithms have reliable convergence properties and provide useful diagnostic information. Finally, a comparison of some probit integral approximation schemes (Clark, and two variants of Mendell-Elston) versus numerical integration is included. There is additional evidence against using Clark's approximation, but a variant of the Mendell-Elston approach appears promising. Numerical problems with variable-ordering techniques (such as separated-split) are demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|The {{significant}} {{growth of}} female labor market participation did not resolve the gender-related differences concerning wages and promotion. According {{to the family}} division of work theory, a comparative advantage between the couple would determine the home and market division of work (Becker, 1965). The wage gap and promotion rates differential could imply less investment by women in their professional background. In the present work, we use a unique dataset of 370 companies that enable the testing of the glass ceiling phenomenon for women in Brazil. Using the <b>empirical</b> <b>probit</b> methodology that enables a qualitative binary analysis of the major occupation of men or women in the companies, the main conclusion {{of this study is}} related to the complexity of female promotion if there is a Board of Administration at the company level. Following the analysis of Westphal and Fredrickson (2001), our results show that the Board usually chooses a CEO that better represents its own profile and, being mostly composed of males, there is greater resistance to female promotion...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{publication}} of Akerlof & Kranton’s (2000) seminal paper, attention has increasingly been focussed also by economists {{on the role of}} identity in shaping individual choice. In this paper we develop a theoretical model of choice which goes beyond that of Akerlof & Kranton by introducing both personal and social identities as factors underlying individual preferences. In this regard it is widely acknowledged that each individual has different social identities depending on the affiliation to macro or micro social groups like family, friends, gender, race, profession, school, town or nation, entailing the sharing of a set of norms, values and beliefs specific to the group (Tajfel, 1982). Thus, generally individuals’ identity and sense of self are bound to the social categories and groups to which they belong. However, identity can be taken as a bidimensional concept embracing also the aspects of personal identity. The latter is defined as a combination of self-esteem, self-concepts and beliefs of self-efficacy and locus of control (Haußer, 1995). In particular, the concept of internal versus external control is related {{to the extent to which}} an individual believes that her actions or characteristics influence the final outcome. The latter, in the case of external locus, is deemed to be affected by chance or fate and goes beyond a person’s control (Rotter, 1966). The model is then used as a basis for the empirical estimation of schooling choices in the UK at sixteen and eighteen. The study employs different rounds of the Youth Cohort Study (YCS). The YCS is a series of (overlapping) panel surveys of young people which provides information, inter alia, on their educational (and other choices) over a period of four years (between the ages of 16 and 19). Optimal educational choices in the model depend, inter alia, on both social and personal identities. The optimal choice expressed as a latent variable leads naturally to the derivation of an <b>empirical</b> <b>probit</b> model of educational choices at sixteen and eighteen. The overlapping panel structure of the data facilitates the identification of the different components of choice...|$|E

40|$|In <b>empirical</b> studies, the <b>probit</b> and logit {{models are}} often used without checks for their {{competing}} distributional specifications. It is also rare for econometric tests {{to be focused on}} this issue. Santos Silva ["Journal of Applied Econometrics" (2001), Vol. 16, pp. 577 - 597] is an important recent exception. By using the conditional moment test principle, we discuss a wide class of non-nested tests that can easily be applied to detect the competing distributions for the binary response models. This class of tests includes the test of Santos Silva (2001) for the same task as a particular example and provides other useful alternatives. We also compare the performance of these tests by a Monte Carlo simulation. Copyright 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R

The thesis also estimates {{the effect of}} the threat of a reduction-in-force (RIF) on VSI/SSB program acceptance behavior. Data provided by the Defense Data Manpower Center (DMDC) on VSI/SSB eligible Navy officers and Navy and Air Force enlisted personnel in FY 93 and FY 92 are used for the <b>empirical</b> analyses. Multivariate <b>probit</b> models are estimated to predict the voluntary separation rate {{in the absence of the}} financial incentive. These estimates are used to calculate the costs and benefits of the VSI/SSB program for both Navy officers and Navy enlisted personnel. This thesis finds that the VSI/SSB program increased the voluntary separation rate by 44. 93 percent for Navy officers, but only by 4. 29 percent for Navy enlisted personnel. The threat of RIF significantly increases voluntary separation rates. NAGerman Navy autho...|$|R
40|$|Using data on {{informal}} {{market loans}} in the Cochabamba region of Bolivia, we test {{the hypothesis that}} monetary reform in the 1985 - 87 period resulted in a dedollarization of the economy. A theoretical model of the loan market suggests variables to be examined in the <b>empirical</b> analysis. A <b>PROBIT</b> model of the probability of dollar-denominated loans is estimated {{as a function of}} Bolivian inflation, exchange-rate depreciation, and exchangerate volatility. In addition, policy reforms are modeled with dummy variables that switch on at the date of the reforms. In addition to the PROBIT estimates, we aggregate monthly average time series data for the informal market and investigate the hypotheses studied in this alternative data set. The evidence from the informal loan market suggests that the Bolivian stabilization plan was associated with an increase in dollarization rather than a decrease. Several possible reasons for this result are discussed, including a lack of credibility of the announced plan. Dolarization and Monetary Reform. Evidence from the Cochabamba Region of Bolivi...|$|R
40|$|M. Sc. The {{possible}} {{resistance of}} the red spider mite, Tetranychus cinnabarinus, on cotton to the acaricides triazophos and profenofos was studied in the Groblersdal/Marble Hall area. During the 1980 and 1981 seasons T. cinnabarinus was collected from cotton in four districts where mite infestations had been controlled the preceeding two seasons with up to three triazophos sprays per year. A laboratory culture of T. cinnabarinus served as the control and the response of these mites to different concentrations of acaricides were {{compared with those of}} the four field cultures. The toxicity of triazophos and profenofos was evaluated by using the slide-dip technique and mortality readings were taken 24 hours after exposure to the acaricide solutions. The data were subjected to a pro bit analysis. Where pro bit lines could not be fitted second degree polinomial regressions were fitted through the log dose and <b>empirical</b> <b>probits.</b> During 1980 there was little difference between the susceptibility of the four field cultures to triazophos. However, the regression lines of all four cultures when compared with those of the control culture indicated resistance to triazophos. After these field cultures had been reared under controlled conditions and not exposed to pesticides for a year all signs of triazophos resistance disappeared. The four field cultures collected in 1981 showed great variability in their response to triazophos but no indication of resistance was observed. This may be because the recommended cotton pest control programme was more closely followed by the cotton producers in 1981 and fewer acaricide sprays were applied. The accuracy of the mortality readings made 24 hours after exposure to triazophos was investigated by taking readings at intervals of 8 hours. An analysis of the results indicated that the mortality curves calculated from all readings were not significantly different and consequently mortality readings were made every 24 hours after exposure to the acaricide solution. A second laboratory strain of T. cinnabarinus, obtained from the Fruit and Fruit Technology Research Institute in Stellenbosch, and regarded as susceptible to organo phosphates was also tested for resistance to triazophos. The regression lines obtained for this culture was similar to that obtained from the 1980 field cultures. This was taken as an indication of possible resistance and this culture was therefore not used as a con trol in this study. The control culture and the Groblersdal/Marble Hall field cultures did not differ significantly in their susceptibility to profenofos. However, profenofos is not widely used for the control of T. cinnabarinus on cotton and these results indicate that it can still be used effectively for the control of T. cinnabarinus. A third acaricide, amitraz, was also examined to determine its effect on T. cinnabarinus. The slide-dip technique was found to be unsuitable for the determination of mite resistance to amitraz. This acaricide is slow acting and an observation interval longer than 24 hours is required to obtain the necessary mortality data. It is difficult to exclude the effects of starvation when the slide-dip technique is used for prolonged periods and consequently amitraz was not tested further. An alternative method for the effective evaluation of this acaricide must be developed. From this study no definite evidence of resistance of T. cinnabarinus in the Grtoblersdal/Marble Hall cotton growing area to triazophos or profenofos was found. It was concluded that both can still be used effectively in the control programme for mites on cotton...|$|R
30|$|Estimation of {{variance}} components and best linear unbiased predictions (BLUPs) of genotype random effects on continuous traits by fitting linear mixed models (LMMs) to familial data is well established. Statistical models with complex variance structures {{that account for}} pedigree as well as spatial trends within a field layout have been extensively applied to such data to assess if the trait of interest has a significant genetic component and is heritable (Piepho et al. 2008). However, for transformed proportional data the use of LMMs can be limiting and results can be unreliable, particularly when sample sizes are variable and small. Furthermore, in case of some transformations such as the angular, model predictions back-transformed to the original proportional scale are not necessarily bounded in the interval [0, 1]. The <b>empirical</b> logit and <b>probit</b> transformations do not suffer from this problem. When estimating genetic parameters, such as the heritability, of binary traits, parameterisation is better handled on an underlying unbounded continuous liability scale {{in which it is}} most interpretable (Lee et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|The European Union (EU) {{has become}} China's largest trade partner. Although China is the EU's second-largest trading partner and its {{largest source of}} imports, trade {{frictions}} between them have been increasing dramatically. In fact, China has become the major target of EU antidumping investigations in recent years. This paper attempts to identify the main features and determinants of EU antidumping investigations against China. EU antidumping policies and rules will be studied, then, based on the binomial <b>probit,</b> <b>empirical</b> analyses of factors behind the EU antidumping charges during 1998 - 2006 will be conducted. Since China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, EU antidumping charges against China have risen significantly relative to its other trade partners. Many more antidumping charges were made regarding the chemical and metal industries than any other industries. Products or industries which have previously been antidumping targets {{seem to have a}} greater chance of being reinvestigated. Policy implications for the Chinese government indicate (1) to control the amount of exports to the EU, (2) to adjust export composition by upgrading industrial structure and enhancing global competitiveness, and (3) to lobby EU member countries in antidumping cases. ...|$|R
40|$|Professional Doctorate - Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) In {{response}} {{to a couple of}} remarkable revelations of corporate fraud and the increasing level of domination of mainland companies on the Hong Kong stock market that has occurred over the past two decades, this study examines whether boardroom characteristics, financial reporting credibility and corporate ownership structure have an effect on corporate fraud in Hong Kong. In addition, it explores how these factors affect the severity of fraud, and examines possible distinctive features of fraud committed by Chinese companies compared to their local counterparts. The data are obtained from enforcement reports from various regulatory bodies in Hong Kong, together with court reports from local news clippings. This study uses a trimmed sample of 116 event observations comprising 69 suspicious fraud observations and 8 defendant fraud observations. A sample of no-fraud companies with comparable characteristics is used as a control group. Data for the reporting period from 2002 to 2011 are chosen for <b>empirical</b> analyses. <b>Probit</b> models are used to examine factors contributing to the likelihood and severity of corporate fraud. The empirical results indicate that board size, board tenure, multiple board appointments across audit committee members, as well as management turnover, are crucial in explaining corporate fraud and fraud severity. In particular, the first three explanatory variables are negatively related to fraud likelihood and fraud severity while the fourth is positively related. The negative association between outside directors and corporate fraud has been widely documented in prior studies. Surprisingly, this study shows that the proportion of outside directors, as well as corporate ownership structure and financial performance indicators, have no significant effect on corporate wrongdoings in Hong Kong. This study has practical implications regarding the design of appropriate corporate governance mechanisms for the listed entities. One implication is that most listed entities barely meet the required number of independent non-executive directors who must be selected by substantial shareholders. As a result of this, it is a concern that the directors’ independence may be impaired and their effectiveness in curbing management may be lowered...|$|R
40|$|Pesticide residue in {{vegetables}} {{is a major}} {{food safety}} issue in Thailand. A range of vegetable products (organic/pesticide-free/ hydroponic) has emerged in Thai markets that guarantee compliance with maximum residue limits. The Government of Thailand is eager to extend the benefits of this suite of alternative vegetables to the entire population, particularly the semi-urban/rural segments that are often bypassed by such speciality products. However, little information is available to guide such an effort, {{particularly with regard to}} up-country consumer attitudes, shopping and consumption habits and willingness to pay premiums for such produce. This research aims to fill this gap in knowledge. It reports the results of a survey of vegetable consumption and shopping habits and attitudes of 608 consumers in northeast Thailand. Willingness to pay premiums for pesticide residue limit compliant vegetables is also assessed by using a contingent valuation method, and determinants of willingness to pay are examined using an ordered <b>probit</b> <b>empirical</b> model. Results indicate that, given adequate awareness of relative risks, even up-country consumers are willing to pay market premium levels for these products, and that inadequate availability, rather than lack of demand is the constraining factor. Willingness to pay is found to increase with income, age and supermarket sourcing of vegetables. We also discuss the challenge of improving availability at mainstream outlets...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} link between capital account {{openness}} and the output cost associated with a currency crisis. Although the Malaysian experience during the Asian crisis of 1997 - 98 made many researchers and policy makers interested in {{the effectiveness of a}} policy restricting cross-border financial transactions to minimize the output cost, this association has not been exposed to a thorough <b>empirical</b> investigation. The <b>probit</b> analysis in this paper shows that the higher the level of financial openness is, the less likely countries are to experience a currency crisis among industrialized and less developed countries. It is found that a higher level of financial openness prior to a crisis helps to reduce output losses for industrialized countries, but not for less developed or emerging market countries. It is also shown that the duration of post-crisis output contraction can be shorter when an industrialized country has a high level of financial openness, but for the group of EMGs the duration of output contraction can be lengthened if a country has more open capital accounts. However, once the country encounters a currency crisis, the effect of capital account openness differs depending on the level of development. The post-crisis level of financial openness helps industrialized countries to reduce the magnitude of output losses while it increases post-crisis output losses for emerging market and less developed countries. A higher rate of financial liberalization is also found to be detrimental to less developed countries. When the dynamics of output gaps after a crisis are investigated, it is found that the negative effect of a higher level of capital account openness lasts {{for at least three years}} for emerging market countries. In general, I have found that institutional development such as corruption, law and order, and bureaucratic quality, rather than the level of openness in financial markets, is important in lowering the size of post-crisis output losses for the groups of less developed or emerging market countries. Only the group of IDCs appears to be able to reap the effect of capital account liberalization in terms of reducing the size of post-crisis output losses. Moreover, Mahathir’s type of capital restriction policy immediately after the breakout of a crisis does not appear to be effective...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{minimum tillage}} {{technology}} reduces {{the quantity of}} tillage required to produce a crop, thereby reducing soil degradation. The reduced tillage results in increased soil organic matter {{and a reduction in}} soil and water erosion. Producers, researchers, and farm implement manufacturers have reduced land degradation through innovative farming practices and equipment. An example is the innovation of minimum tillage equipment and farming practices which is designed to reduce damage caused by increased tilling of the land. Minimum tillage maintains more of the previous crop’s residue {{on the surface of the}} soil, thereby reducing the damaging effects of wind and water erosion. Some Prairie producers have chosen to adopt minimum tillage technology, while others continue to use conventional tillage. The objective of this thesis is to determine which socio-economic, farm, and regional characteristics are influential in determining whether minimum tillage technology and practices are adopted. The theoretical framework for this thesis is based on an agriculture producer’s objective function. A lexicographic utility function is used, which means that each element of the utility function must be satisfied in order of rank with the highest level of utility achieved when the greatest number of elements has been satisfied. For the <b>empirical</b> analysis a <b>Probit</b> model is used to model the decision of whether to adopt minimum tillage technology. A number of socio-economic, farm, and regional characteristics, such as age, education, farm size, soil type, weather, and location of a research farm, were included as explanatory variables. The primary data source for the empirical analysis was farm level data from the Agriculture and Population Census data from 1991, 1996, and 2001, which resulted in over 42, 000 observations in the data set. A number of model specifications and sensitivity analyses were run and the results obtained were consistent with one another, thus the findings presented in this thesis are robust. A number of socio-economic, farm, and regional characteristics are significant in determining whether minimum tillage is adopted. These variables include: Alberta dummy variable, summerfallow, age, total farm area, gross farm sales, black, brown, and dark gray soils, corporate operating structure, time, average maximum April and June temperature, and total June precipitation...|$|R
