50|$|Coupling to the {{resonator}} can {{be achieved}} with a tap wire soldered to the helix at {{some distance from the}} shorted end. Input impedance varies with distance from the shorted end by impedance transformer action. The tap point is chosen to achieve an impedance match with the connected circuit. Tuning of the resonator may be achieved by inserting a screw into the central axis of the helix (Weston, 2001, p. 660). Other means of input and output coupling used are a wire loop coupling to the magnetic field near the shorted end, or a probe capacitively coupling near the open <b>end.</b> <b>Coupling</b> between resonators in a multi-resonator filter is often simply achieved with apertures in the shielding between them (Whittaker, 2000, p. 227).|$|E

To prevent the destruction of the <b>end</b> <b>coupling</b> it is essential for mechanical life cycle to be known. In this paper, a parameter study on <b>end</b> <b>coupling</b> was performed in order to minimize maximum stress of an <b>end</b> <b>coupling</b> under static loads. To verify the interference of spindle assembly with modified <b>end</b> <b>coupling,</b> kinematic simulation was performed by applying the various combination type and dynamic boundary condition of the spindle assembly.

40|$|Retroviral integration, {{like all}} forms of DNA transposition, {{proceeds}} {{through a series of}} DNA cutting and joining reactions. During transposition, the 3 ′ ends of linear transposon or donor DNA are joined to the 5 ′ phosphates of a double-stranded cut in target DNA. Single-end transposition must be avoided in vivo because such aberrant DNA products would be unstable and the transposon would therefore risk being lost from the cell. To avoid suicidal single-end integration, transposons link the activity of their transposase protein to the combined functionalities of both donor DNA ends. Although previous work suggested that this critical coupling between transposase activity and DNA ends occurred before the initial hydrolysis step of retroviral integration, work in the related Tn 10 and V(D) J recombination systems had shown that <b>end</b> <b>coupling</b> regulated transposase activity after the initial hydrolysis step of DNA transposition. Here, we show that integrase efficiently hydrolyzed just the wild-type end of two different single-end mutants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in vivo, which, in contrast to previous results, proves that two functional DNA ends are not required to activate integrase's initial hydrolysis activity. Furthermore, despite containing bound protein at their processed DNA ends, these mutant viruses did not efficiently integrate their singly cleaved wild-type end into target DNA in vitro. By comparing our results to those of related DNA recombination systems, we propose the universal model that <b>end</b> <b>coupling</b> regulates transposase activity after the first chemical step of DNA transposition...|$|E

40|$|Previous papers {{related to}} the {{optimization}} of pressure vessels have considered the optimization of the nozzle independently from the dished end. This approach generates problems such as thickness variation from nozzle to dished <b>end</b> (<b>coupling</b> cylindrical region) and, as a consequence, it reduces the optimality of the final result which may also {{be influenced by the}} boundary conditions. Thus, this work discusses shape optimization of axisymmetric pressure vessels considering an integrated approach in which the entire pressure vessel model is used in conjunction with a multi-objective function that aims to minimize the von-Mises mechanical stress from nozzle to head. Representative examples are examined and solutions obtained for the entire vessel considering temperature and pressure loading. It is noteworthy that different shapes from the usual ones are obtained. Even though such different shapes may not be profitable considering present manufacturing processes, they may be competitive for future manufacturing technologies, and contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the actual influence of shape in the behavior of pressure vessels.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{satellite}} relative motion {{has been of}} great historic interest, primarily due to its application to rendezvous, intercept, and docking maneuvers, between spacecraft in orbit about gravitational bodies, such as the Earth. Recent interest in the problem of satellite formation flight has also led to renewed effort in understanding the dynamics of relative motion. Satellite formations have been proposed for various tasks, such as deep-space interferometry, and terrestrial observation, among others. Oftentimes, the rich natural dynamics of the relative motion problem near a gravitational body are exploited to design formations of a specific geometry. Traditional analysis models relative motion under the assumptions of a circular reference orbit, linearized differential gravity field (small relative distance), and without environmental perturbations such as oblateness effects of the attracting body, and atmospheric drag.

Consequently, the combined effects of nonlinearity, eccentricity, and Earth oblateness effects on relative motion, are studied. To this <b>end,</b> <b>coupling</b> effects between the variou...|$|E

The advantages of these elements are shown through the analysis of various structural problems. Note that their main advantage is to allow complex structural shapes to be simulated without classical problems of connecting zones meshed with different element types. These solid-shell elements have a special direction called the “thickness”, along which a set of integration points are located. Reduced integration is also used to prevent some locking phenomena and to increase computational efficiency.

40|$|Purpose. Evaluate the {{effectiveness}} of distal-end coupling of a tumor-specific antibody to liposomal polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains to improve target binding and reduce interference by macrophage uptake. Methods. Monoclonal antibody CC 52, specific for CC 531 rat colon carcinoma, was coupled to the bilayer of PEG-liposomes (type I) or to the distal end of bilayer-anchored PEG-chains (type II). Uptake of both (radiolabeled) liposome types by CC 531 cells and rat liver macrophages was determined. Results. With increasing antibody density, both immunoliposome types showed increased binding to target cells, but type II liposomes displayed better target recognition than type I. Uptake by macrophages increased with antibody density for both liposome types. Lowest uptake by macrophages was found for type II liposomes at low antibody densities. Unexpectedly, not only for type I but also for type II liposomes, in which the antibody is coupled via its Fc moiety, uptake by macrophages was inhibited by aggregated IgG, indicating involvement of Fc receptors. Also polyinosinic acid, an inhibitor of scavenger receptors, reduced uptake of type II liposomes. Conclusion.
