40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} is to compare the oral hygiene status and dental caries {{experience}} among institutionalized visually <b>impaired</b> and hearing <b>impaired</b> children of age between 7 and 17 years in Bhopal city of Madhya Pradesh located in Central India. Materials and Methods: A total of 95 hearing <b>impaired</b> and 48 visually <b>impaired</b> children of age between 7 and 17 years were recruited from special care institutions (one institution of hearing <b>impaired</b> and two institutions of visually <b>impaired)</b> in Bhopal city. Information related to different study variables was obtained from both groups. Oral hygiene index simplified (OHI[S]), decayed,extracted, filled teeth (deft and DECAYED, MISSING, FILLED TETTH (DMFT)) indices were used to record the oral hygiene status and dental caries experience. Results: Mean OHI(S) score for hearing <b>impaired</b> was 1. 15 ± 0. 72 while it was 1. 51 ± 0. 93 for visually <b>impaired</b> children (P < 0. 05). Mean DMFT score was 1. 4 ± 1. 95 and 0. 94 ± 1. 45 among hearing <b>impaired</b> and visually <b>impaired</b> respectively. The hearing <b>impaired</b> had a mean deft score of 0. 47 ± 1. 01 and in visually <b>impaired</b> it was 0. 19 ± 0. 79 and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: Oral hygiene status of hearing <b>impaired</b> children was better than visually <b>impaired</b> and the difference was statistically significant. There was no significant difference between both groups with respect to DMFT. The hearing <b>impaired</b> children had significantly higher deft than visually <b>impaired...</b>|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} study is to investigate and compare the speed and intelligibility of speech in hearing <b>impaired</b> and normal hearing Persian speaking elementary school boys and girls. 33 hearing <b>impaired</b> students are randomly selected from three hearing <b>impaired</b> groups (profound, severe and moderately-severe) and compared with 60 normal hearing students. The speed of speech was measured according to reading Words Per Minute (WPM), and speech intelligibility was tested by a 5 -rank scale method. As expected, the normal hearing had more speed and intelligibility of speech in contrast to the hearing <b>impaired</b> group. Also hearing <b>impaired</b> boys had a better speed and intelligibility of speech compared to hearing <b>impaired</b> girls but in normal hearing group, girls had better speed. The amount of P-value for moderately-severe and sever hearing <b>impaired</b> was 0. 006 and this amount for profound and moderately-severe hearing <b>impaired</b> was 0. 002, so p-value is < 0. 05 and significantly important.

40|$|Master of EducationThis project {{addresses}} {{the application of}} educational drama with vision <b>impaired</b> children. It reports on three years of research and practical experience {{in the area and}} aims to highlight how important and relevant drama is for this population, thus pioneering a broad and purposeful usage of drama with vision <b>impaired</b> children. An implementation of educational drama with vision <b>impaired</b> children requires an understanding of both drama, in its educational and therapeutic forms, and vision impairment and its implications. In this way the project sought to investigate the areas of drama, drama therapy and vision impairment separately before addressing the application of drama with vision <b>impaired</b> children. The first part of the thesis reports on this theoretical background information. The second part of the thesis links these areas and reports on the application of drama with vision <b>impaired</b> children {{in the form of a}} manual. After establishing a case for drama with vision <b>impaired</b> children, the project provides practical information as to how to implement drama techniques with the vision <b>impaired</b> child. An 'action cycle' is put forward involving observation, planning, implementation and evaluation stages. Teaching methods are given and discussed for the singularly <b>impaired</b> vision <b>impaired</b> child, the child with additional impairment and, to a lesser extent, the multiply <b>impaired</b> vision <b>impaired</b> child. Examples are used extensively throughout and case-study material is provided. The project {{addresses the}} following audiences: (i) teachers working with vision <b>impaired</b> children who would like to implement drama techniques (ii) teachers, including drama teachers, who have a vision <b>impaired</b> child in their class and who would like to know more about vision impairment and how drama can be utilised with a vision <b>impaired</b> child (iii) others, outside the field of education, such as therapists, medical practitioners and care-givers who are involved with vision <b>impaired</b> children (iv) parents of vision <b>impaired</b> children (v) as the vision <b>impaired</b> population includes many children with additional disability, including physical, intellectual, hearing, emotional and social problems, the project may be useful for those working with children with impairments other than visual.

40|$|Acquired {{brain injury}} (ABI) {{frequently}} {{results in a}} characteristic spectrum of physical, cognitive, and behavioural consequences. Individuals with ABI are often unable to appreciate these consequences and comprehend the influence of these deficits on everyday life. These individuals {{are said to have}} <b>impaired</b> awareness. A selective overview of the literature on <b>impaired</b> awareness following ABI is presented. Emphasis is placed on terminology, theories, measurement, treatment, and the relationship between <b>impaired</b> awareness and emotional distress. It was established that the relationship between <b>impaired</b> awareness and aspects of neuropsychological and mood functioning is still unclear. In addition, relatively few empirical studies have investigated treatment techniques for <b>impaired</b> awareness. This study investigated the association between <b>impaired</b> awareness and executive functioning, and the relationship between <b>impaired</b> awareness and emotional distress with a sample of 30 adults with ABI. A sub-sample of 17 individuals with <b>impaired</b> awareness participated in an intervention where they received feedback of their brain scan findings. The main finding of the study was that measures of <b>impaired</b> awareness and emotional distress decreased following the feedback intervention. No evidence of a statistically significant relationship between <b>impaired</b> awareness and mood, or <b>impaired</b> awareness and executive functioning was found. There was a trend towards poor planning ability being related to unrealistic goal setting. Recommendations for further research in this area of neuropsychology and neurorehabilitation are made...|$|R

In this article, these questions are studied in a practice report of a course involving visually <b>impaired</b> and sighted students working in groups, studying in a museum and creating art work at schools for the blind (i. e. schools maintained for visually <b>impaired</b> and blind students). The study found that by arguing that sighted and visually <b>impaired</b> students can learn about each-others’ perceptual similarities and potentials by working together, and that art is a particularly effective medium for developing this understanding.

40|$|It is {{possible}} for Visually <b>Impaired</b> people to do most jobs {{if they have the}} right training, technological assistance and emotional support. Yet it is difficult for Visually <b>Impaired</b> people to get employment, and also difficult to adapt to the workplace when a person becomes Visually <b>Impaired.</b> The purpose of the study is to explore how those who become Visually <b>Impaired</b> adapt to their work environment. In exploring these adaptations, the research aims to discover, firstly, if the Visually <b>Impaired</b> are doing the jobs they want to and how they go about doing so. Secondly, to discover which technology, equipment, support and training is helpful in aiding the VI in the workplace. Thirdly, to discover if the Visually <b>Impaired</b> person feels normal if physical and social barriers in the workplace are removed. And lastly, if the Visually <b>Impaired</b> do adapt to the workplace after they become Visually <b>Impaired.</b> The physical and social barriers a Visually <b>Impaired</b> person faces at work, the emotional adaptation that needs to be made when Visual Impairment sets in, the adaptive technology and equipment that assist the Visually <b>Impaired</b> at work, as well as the legislation relevant to the Visually <b>Impaired</b> worker are discussed. The qualitative approach is used as the method of research as the objective of the study is to understand the experience of those becoming Visually <b>Impaired</b> and adapting to their workplaces from within their own environments. Data was collected by means of interviews from five participants, and case studies written to describe their experiences. Comparisons were drawn to assist in analyzing the participants’ experiences. A number of assumptions were then made about Visually <b>Impaired</b> people, as a number of possible issues came to light that the majority of Visually <b>Impaired</b> people might experience in some way or other, {{as a result of the}} similarities in the experiences of the Visually <b>Impaired</b> participants. The following assumptions were made: The Visually <b>Impaired</b> do adapt to the work environment. The Visually <b>Impaired</b> must make certain adaptations to cope at work under their new circumstances. Adaptive technology and equipment, training and support are necessary and helpful to the Visually <b>Impaired</b> in the workplace. Some of the Visually <b>Impaired</b> participants are doing jobs they want to do, and others are not. Some Visually <b>Impaired</b> people feel normal and have always feel normal; others need physical and social barriers removed, to feel normal; and yet others would feel normal if they could have those things they took for granted before, back. The positive reaction of colleagues, clients and managers depends on two things: their knowledge of the Visually <b>Impaired</b> and the Visually <b>Impaired</b> person’s attitude to life and his/her impairment. Most Visually <b>Impaired</b> people need and can find some form of meaningful activity in their lives. Copyright 2002, University of Pretoria. All rights reserved.
