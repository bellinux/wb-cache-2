5000|$|The <b>graphite</b> <b>bomb</b> {{was first}} used against Iraq in the Gulf War (1990-1991), {{knocking}} out 85% of the electrical supply. Similarly, the BLU-114/B [...] "Soft-Bomb" [...] <b>graphite</b> <b>bomb</b> was used by NATO against Serbia in May 1999, disabling 70% of that country's power grid. After initial success in disabling Serbian electric power systems, the electric supply was restored in less than 24 hours. The BLU-114/B was again used {{a few days later}} to counter Serbian efforts to restore damage caused by the initial attack. In the later stage of Operation Allied Force, NATO's air forces used conventional bombs and rockets to target power highlines and transformer stations. Graphite bombs only work on power lines that are not insulated.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>graphite</b> <b>bomb</b> (also {{known as}} the [...] "Blackout Bomb" [...] or the [...] "Soft Bomb") is a {{non-lethal}} weapon used to disable electrical power systems. Graphite bombs work by spreading a cloud of extremely fine, chemically treated carbon filaments over electrical components, causing a short-circuit and a disruption of the electrical supply. The filaments {{are only a few}} hundredths of an inch thick and can float {{in the air like a}} dense cloud. The weapon is sometimes referred to as a [...] "soft bomb", since its effects are largely confined to the targeted electrical power facility, with minimal risk of collateral damage.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{short circuit}} {{collapse}} problem of {{electric power system}} attacked by graphite bombs was investigated. The harm of graphite bombs and the vulnerability of electrical network were analyzed. Two kinds of failure modes called direct short circuit failure and indirect short circuit failure were presented accordingly. The arc generation mechanism of conductive filaments dispensed from graphite bombs was analyzed {{and the concept of}} compulsively consecutive arc was presented. Then the verifying experiments under the condition of high voltage and small current were done. The short circuit blockade principle of electric power system by graphite bombs was also analyzed. In order to react to the attack of graphite bombs effectively, the clearing methods of conductive filaments such as mechanical removal, combustion and lightning impulse were presented which are helpful to recover the current supply capability of electric power system rapidly. Index Terms—Blockade, clearing method, compulsively consecutive arc, conductive filaments, <b>graphite</b> <b>bomb,</b> power system, short circuit. I...|$|E
50|$|The major {{transmission}} grid's substation {{for western}} Belgrade {{is located in}} Bežanija and was heavily damaged during the NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999. The <b>graphite</b> <b>bombs</b> (or blackout bombs) were used. The major substation for eastern Belgrade, in Leštane was also bombed.|$|R
50|$|Inside the museum's main building, the {{exhibits}} {{are found in}} a single long hall progressing from ancient through medieval and then towards modern. All exhibits are labeled in the Serbian Language in both Cyrillic and Latin, as well as English. Outside the museum's main building, there are numerous tanks, howitzers, and armoured cars of many types. Some were acquired during World War II, when they were captured by the Red Army and Yugoslav Partisans from retreating Nazi and Axis forces (Belgrade Offensive). These decommissioned tanks and artillery pieces line the walls and paths leading into the Military Museum from two directions. Recent exhibits address NATO actions against Serbia in 1999, including the controversial use of cluster bombs, depleted uranium, and <b>graphite</b> <b>bombs,</b> {{some of which are}} claimed to be in violation of international law. A well-known exhibit features parts of a US F-117 stealth aircraft which was downed by a Serbian S-125 Neva/Pechora.|$|R
