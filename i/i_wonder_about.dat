I might wait for days to get better acquainted. But the impulse is on me. I've been so interested in all you Mormon women. The fact--the meaning of this hidden village is so--so terrible to me. But that's none of my business. I have spent my afternoons and evenings with these women at the different cottages. You do not mingle with them. They are lonely, but have not such loneliness as yours. I have passed here every night. No light--no sound. I can't help thinking. Don't censure me or be afraid or draw within yourself just because I must think. I may be all wrong. But I'm curious. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>about</b> you. Who are you? Mary--Mary what? Maybe I really don't want to know. I came with selfish motive and now I'd like to--to--what shall I say? Make your life a little less lonely for the while I'm here. That's all. It needn't offend.

6000|$|Mrs. Lodge {{has written}} to me, and I have {{answered}} her letter, but I long very particularly {{to hold out}} my hand to you in person, and take your own and keep it a moment ever so tenderly and faithfully. All these months I haven't known of the blow that has descended on you or I'm sure you feel that I would have made you some sign. My communications with Boston are few and faint in these days--though what I do hear has in general {{more or less the}} tragic note. You must have been through much darkness and living on now in a changed world. I hadn't seen her, you know, for long years, and as I have just said to Mrs. Lodge, always thought of her, or remembered her, as I saw her in youth--charming and young and bright, animated and eager, with life all before her. Great must be your alteration. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>about</b> you and yet spend my wonder in vain, and somehow think we were meant not so to miss--during long years--sight and knowledge of each other. But life does strange and incalculable things with us all--life which I myself still find interesting. I have a hope that you do--in spite of everything. I wish I hadn't so awkwardly failed, practically, of seeing you when I was in America; then I should be better able to write to you now. Make me some sign--wonderful above all would be the sign that in great freedom you might come again at last to these regions of the earth. How I should hold out my hands to you! But perhaps you stick, as it were, to your past.... I don't know, you see, and I can only make you these uncertain, yet all affectionate motions. The best thing I can tell you about myself is that I have no second self to part with--having lived always deprived! But I've had other things, and may you still find you have--a few! Don't fail of feeling me at any rate, my dear George, ever so tenderly yours, ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{has been}} {{delightful}} {{to me to}} hear from you even on so sorry a subject as my poor old prostrated tree; which it was most kind of you to go and take a pitying look at. He might have gone on for some time, I think, {{in the absence of an}} inordinate gale--but once the fury of the tempest really descended he was bound to give way, because his poor old heart was dead, his immense old trunk hollow. He had no power to resist left when the south-wester caught him by his vast crinière and simply twisted his head round and round. It's very sad, for he was the making of the garden--he was it in person; and now I feel for the time as if I didn't care what becomes of it--my interest wholly collapses. But what a folly to talk of that prostration, among all the prostrations that surround us! One hears of them here on every side--and they represent (of course I am speaking of the innumerable splendid young men, fallen in their flower) the crushingly black side of all the horrible business, the irreparable dead loss of what is most precious, the inestimable seed of the future. The air is full of the sense of all that dreadfulness--the echoes forever in one's ears. Still, I haven't wanted to wail to you--and don't write you for that. London isn't cheerful, but vast and dark and damp and very visibly depleted (as well may be!) and yet is also in a sense uplifting and reassuring, such an impression does one get here after all of the enormous resources of this empire. I mean that the reminders at every turn are so great. I see a few people--quite as many as I can do with; for I find I can't do with miscellaneous chatter or make a single new acquaintance--look at a solitary new face save that of the wounded soldiers in hospital, whom I see something of and find of a great and touching interest. Yet the general conditions of town I find the only ones I can do with now, and I am more glad than I can say to think of Mrs. Lloyd and her daughters supplanting me, at their ease, at dear old L.H. I rejoice {{to hear from you}} of Beau's fine outlook and I send him my aged blessing--as I do to his Father, who must take good comfort of him. I am afraid on the other hand that all these diluvian and otherwise devastated days haven't contributed to the gaiety (I won't say of [...] "nations"--what will have become, forever, of that? but) of golfers pure and simple. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>about</b> you much, and very tenderly, and wish you weren't so far, or my agility so extinct.

5000|$|Sergio Zanni defines his {{research}} in arts and sculpture: “My job {{allows me to}} continuously travel in order to discover unknown sites. These sites have been materialized in several characters: hermits, rain men, killers, war memorials, devils, attendants of the plains, gypsies, observers, hikers. Deep-sea divers, water, front-less characters, pilots, cloud hunters, oblomov, smokers, painters of war, mysterious angels, with no front, siren’s songs, and go on until to the last sculptures, the equilibrists, Ulysses and other hikers. Near {{the end of the}} 20s century <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>about</b> realizing large sized sculptures: the loved backed clay is regrettably heavy and fragile. I was forced in some way to test more handy and less noble materials than the backed clay. In this last step the experience with the polystyrene covered by kryptonite and iron balls (all very recent materials used on the stages), fibreglass, iron rods and assemblages with iron material took place. From these materials my largest sculptures aroused: kamikazes, the wagon of the winners, the six white pilots, the large traveller." ...|$|E
5000|$|His former cell-mate Leo Stein was {{released}} from Sachsenhausen to go to America, and he wrote an article about Niemöller for The National Jewish Monthly in 1941. Stein reports having asked Niemöller why he ever supported the Nazi Party, to which Niemöller replied: I find myself wondering about that too. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>about</b> {{it as much as}} I regret it. Still, it is true that Hitler betrayed me. I had an audience with him, {{as a representative of the}} Protestant Church, shortly before he became Chancellor, in 1932. Hitler promised me on his word of honor, to protect the Church, and not to issue any anti-Church laws. He also agreed not to allow pogroms against the Jews, assuring me as follows: [...] "There will be restrictions against the Jews, but there will be no ghettos, no pogroms, in Germany." [...] I really believed, given the widespread anti-Semitism in Germany, at that time—that Jews should avoid aspiring to Government positions or seats in the Reichstag. There were many Jews, especially among the Zionists, who took a similar stand. Hitler's assurance satisfied me at the time. On the other hand, I hated the growing atheistic movement, which was fostered and promoted by the Social Democrats and the Communists. Their hostility toward the Church made me pin my hopes on Hitler for a while. [...] I am paying for that mistake now; and not me alone, but thousands of other persons like me.|$|E

60|$|That {{night we}} sailed for Alacranes. It {{was a white}} night of the tropics, with a million stars {{blinking}} in the blue dome overhead, and the Caribbean Sea like a shadowed opal, calm and rippling and shimmering. The Xpit was not a bark of comfort. It had a bare deck and an empty hold. I could not stay below in that gloomy, ill-smelling pit, so I tried to sleep on deck. I lay on a hatch under the great boom, and what with its creaking, and the hollow roar of the sail, and the wash of the waves, and the dazzling starlight, I could not sleep. C. sat on a coil of rope, smoked, and watched in silence. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>about</b> him then.|$|R
5000|$|An {{interesting}} sentence from Meins Coetsier’s book on Etty Hillesum. He {{comments on}} the fact that her writing and silent meditation helped her to “tap into an area within herself that in society had mainly vanished.” Voegelin believed that the disappearance of meditation as a ‘cultural factor’ resulted in the practical ignorance of those aspects of reality touched on by myth, philosophy and mysticism. In other words the secularisation of society has deprived people, or most people perhaps, of an awareness of the depth of reality, of the spiritual dimension. He goes on to talk about a ‘perverse closure of consciousness against reality’ (p. 129). <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>about</b> the ‘perverse’. For some, perhaps, yes. They make a conscious decision to ignore any spiritual promptings. But for many, I think, socialisation into a secular and materialist culture has simply obscured any such awareness. The occasions when they might perhaps suspect that there is more to reality than the material surface of things are when they encounter a limit situation. Though it is also the case, as David Hay found in his Nottingham survey,2 that many people feel that there is ‘something there’, that there is more to reality than surface appearances. But ‘a feeling’ is about as far as it goes. This is not something people generally feel they can talk about with others. Spirituality, religion, mysticism are all taboo subjects. We all have capax dei and in some exceptional people, like Etty Hillesum, awareness of it develops in spite, or maybe because of external circumstances. But in most of us it needs to be nurtured and guided.|$|E
50|$|Between 1943-1945 she {{was imprisoned}} by the Czech Nazi government. At that time, she also {{converted}} to Catholicism and after World War II she {{participated in the}} activities of the Czech catholic circles, inspired by the Croatia Jesuit Tomislav Kolakovic. She co-worked with active Czech Catholics Oto Mádr, Josef Zvěřina and others. In February 1948, she attended, as {{the only one of the}} Charles University pedagogues, the student march to the Prague Castle. As this was to support the president Edvard Beneš, it brought her the negative attention of the Czech communists. At the first after-February meeting of the professors of the Faculty of Arts she was again the only one who protested against expulsion of the students who had participated in the march from school. She proclaimed:I agree with the Dean as to the events of the past days. However, I missed the statement that each community is based on its moral code. I judge the moral code by its criteria. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>about</b> the criteria that led to the expulsion of the professors and even students. If I witnessed and participated in the manifestations, I proclaim, that these were true manifestations and not demonstrations, as the slogans I heard were of neither political nor of economic character. On the contrary, they were of moral character. If the participation in the march was the reason for the expulsion of the students, then I wish to share their fate.After the University banned her from lecturing at the beginning of 1950s, she continued her activities. She was arrested in 1951 and in 1952 she was sentenced to 22 years of jail for espionage and high treason during the process of Ota Mádr and his associates. The State Court in Brno was chaired by Jaroslav Novák, the state prosecution was led by JUDr. Karel Čížek. The process was public and there were about 1,500 people in the audience.|$|E
