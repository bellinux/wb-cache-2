Synchrotron Mossbauer and polarized neutron reflectometric maps show micrometer-size primary domain formation as the external field decreases from saturation to remanence. A secondary domain state consisting mainly {{of at least}} 1 order of magnitude larger domains is created when a small field along the layer magnetizations induces a bulk-spin-flop transition. The domain-size distribution is reproducibly dependent on the magnetic prehistory.

30|$|I next {{provide an}} {{introductory}} review of solar field models, and then describe {{observations of the}} large-scale solar field patterns. Following this overall introduction, I shall then discuss the modeling bases, more detailed modeling aspects, and parameters. Details of {{certain aspects of the}} modeling are brought forth throughout this article, so neither the Appendix nor the article resembles a cookbook. One may find a zipped file of the program and needed files that run the model discussed herein: solfieldmapping.zip. The Appendix, however, does discuss and gives references to aspects of the relationship between moving magnetic fields and time-dependent flows; that magnetic field lines form “streaklines” not streamlines, as generally thought. Additionally, it discusses why field lines move towards uniform field magnitude, thereby lowering the total <b>external</b> <b>field</b> <b>energy.</b>|$|E

The Kuhn's model is used to study nonlinear gyrotropic medium with great success. The Kuhn's model presents itself a model of nonlinear coupled oscillators. This article is devoted {{to the study of the}} Kuhn's nonlinear model. In the first paragraph of the paper we study classical dynamics in case of weak as well as strong nonlinearity. In case of week nonlinearity we have obtained the analytical solutions, which are in good agreement with the numerical solutions. In case of strong nonlinearity we have determined the values of those parameters for which chaos is formed in the system under study. The second paragraph of the paper refers to the question of the Kuhn's model integrability. It is shown, that at the certain values of the interaction potential this model is exactly integrable and under certain conditions it is reduced to so-called universal Hamiltonian. The third paragraph of the paper is devoted to quantum-mechanical consideration. It shows the possibility of stochastic absorption of <b>external</b> <b>field</b> <b>energy</b> by nonlinear gyrotropic medium.

40|$|The {{motion of}} {{polymers}} with inhomogeneous structure through nanopores is discussed theoretically. Specifically, {{we consider the}} translocation dynamics of polymers consisting of double-stranded and single-stranded blocks. Since only the single-stranded chain can go through the nanopore the double-stranded segment has to unzip before the translocation. Utilizing a simple analytical model, translocation times are calculated explicitly for different polymer orientations, i. e., when the single-stranded block enters the pore first and when the double-stranded segment is a leading one. The dependence of the translocation dynamics on <b>external</b> <b>fields,</b> <b>energy</b> of interaction in the double-stranded segment, size of the polymer and the fraction of double-stranded monomers is analyzed. It is found that the order of entrance into the pore has {{a significant effect on}} the translocation dynamics. The theoretical results are discussed using free-energy landscape arguments.

The diffusion coefficient is analytically calculated for any value of the field showing a minimum at intermediate field intensities.

40|$|We {{show that}} dark solitons in 1 D Bose liquids may {{be created by}} {{absorption}} of a single quanta of an <b>external</b> ac <b>field,</b> in a close analogy with the Einstein's photoelectric effect. Similarly to the von Lenard's experiment with photoexcited electrons, the <b>external</b> <b>field's</b> photon <b>energy</b> ħω should exceed a certain threshold.

This dependence is a signature of the quantum nature of the absorption process and the orthogonality catastrophe phenomenon associated with it. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figures.

40|$|The {{problem of}} backreaction of quantum {{processes}} on {{the properties of}} the background field still remains on the list of outstanding questions of high intensity particle physics. Usually, photon emission by an electron or positron, photon decay into electron-positron pairs in strong electromagnetic fields, or electron-positron pair production by such fields are described in the framework of the <b>external</b> <b>field</b> approximation. It is assumed that the <b>external</b> <b>field</b> has infinite <b>energy</b> and is not affected by these processes. However, the above-mentioned processes have a multi-photon nature, i. e., they occur with the absorption of a significant number of field photons. As a result, the interaction of an intense electromagnetic field with either a highly charged electron bunch or a fast growing population of electrons, positrons, and gamma photons (as {{in the case of an}} electromagnetic cascade) may lead to a depletion of the <b>field</b> <b>energy,</b> thus making the <b>external</b> <b>field</b> approximation invalid.

40|$|We {{present in}} detail the bosonization-refermionization {{solution}} of the anisotropic version of the two-channel Anderson model at a particular manifold {{in the space of}} parameters of the theory, where we establish an equivalence with a Fermi-Majorana bi-resonant level model. The correspondence is rigorously proved by explicitly constructing the new fermionic fields and Klein factors in terms of the original ones and showing that the commutation properties between original and new Klein factors are of semionic type. We also demonstrate that the fixed points associated to the solvable manifold are renormalization-group stable and generic, and therefore representative of the physics of the original model. The simplicity of the solution found, allows for the computation of the full set of thermodynamic quantities. In particular, we compute the entropy, occupation and magnetization of the impurity as functions of temperature, and identify the different physical energy scales. In absence of <b>external</b> <b>fields,</b> two <b>energy</b> scales appear and, as the temperature goes to zero, a non-trivial residual entropy indicates that the model approaches a universal line of fixed points of non-Fermi liquid type. An <b>external</b> <b>field,</b> even if small, introduces a third energy scale and causes the quenching of the impurity entropy to zero, taking the system to a corresponding Fermi-liquid fixed point.

At high excitation energies around the Stark saddle point the eigenenergies exhibit strong level repulsions when the angle between the fields is varied. The large avoided crossings occur between states with the same approximately conserved principal quantum number, $n$, and this intramanifold mixing of states cannot be explained, not even qualitatively, by conventional perturbation theory. However, it is well reproduced by an extended perturbation theory which takes into account all couplings between the angular momentum and Runge-Lenz vector.

The calculation allows identification of field dependent anisotropies and wall widths of the two phases, which become equal at the reversal field.
