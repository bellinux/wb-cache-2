40|$|A {{combined}} GALILEO/GPS/EGNOS user receiver {{represents a}} key {{technology for the}} upcoming European satellite navigation system GALILEO. The receiver is the main physical interface between the system and the user. It transforms the GALILEO signal-in-space into services for the citizens. Within the project GAMMA a consortium of nine industrial and research partners, lead by Fraunhofer IIS, located in Nuremberg, Germany, develop an assisted GALILEO/GPS/EGNOS receiver prototype and perform research {{on the development of}} a Multichannel GALILEO/GPS/EGNOS Signal Generator for the design and evaluation of the receiver. For the assistance data link an UMTS communications link will be emulated. The GNSS Signal Generator will be responsible for GPS/GALILEO signal generation and the correction and acquisition aiding data provision. Further work encompasses studies of indoor navigation capabilities, reconfigurable and hence reusable digital hardware components, assisted acquisition co ncepts and finally low cost optimizations. The GAMMA receiver will fulfill both main requirements of the second call of GALILEO <b>JOINT</b> <b>UNDERTAKING</b> to elaborate core technologies and to implement a low cost/low power receiver solution for mass market applications. Low cost and a high degree of integration is mainly dependent on the design of the RF-front-end. The project was started in Nov. 2005 and will run for 2 years until Oct. 2007. The initial work was focused on application scenarios, specification and system design. Now the receiver front-end and baseband solutions will be developed, complemented by the research on the development of a GNSS Signal Generator and an emulated assistance data link for a complete end-to-end demonstration. The project is funded under a contract of the GALILEO <b>JOINT</b> <b>UNDERTAKING.</b> The paper presents the main system and receiver specifications, the selected architecture concept and first simulation results of the envisaged component developments of the low cost GALILEO/...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe IT 2 Rail-“Information Technologies for Shift 2 Rail” {{project is}} a first step towards the long term IP 4 -“IT Solutions for Attractive Railway Services”, one of the Shift 2 Rail <b>Joint</b> <b>Undertaking's</b> Innovation Programmes, which aims at {{providing}} a new seamless travel experience, giving access to a complete multimodal travel offer which connects the first and last mile to long distance journeys. This is achieved through the introduction of a ground breaking Technical Enabler based on two concepts:•The traveler is placed at the heart of innovative solutions, accessing all multimodal travel services (shopping, ticketing, and tracking) through its travel-companion. •An open published framework is providing full interoperability whilst limiting impacts on existing systems, without prerequisites for centralized standardization. This Technical Enabler will be completely settled {{in the context of the}} Shift 2 Rail IP 4, and IT 2 Rail is proposing a reduced approach to the scale of a specified use case without weakening any of the key concepts of IP 4, such as the usage of Semantic Web technologies, meta planning on distributed data, travel companion with a protected and secured personal wallet stored in the cloud and including the rights to travel. The use cases will be defined as specific instantiations of our open concepts, and will benefit from a completely scalable architecture fully instantiated in IP 4. This approach is addressing all the key challenges of the work program, supporting a complete door-to- door multimodal travel offer and proposing a seamless integration of the very diverse existing and future services for planning, one-stop-shop ticketing, and real-time re-accommodation. Moreover, thanks to an Interoperability framework which insulates travel applications from the standards fragmentation in multimodal transport, IT 2 Rail liberates business-model innovations in the market-place, guaranteeing the economic self-sustainability of these e-services in the long-term...|$|R

The study adopted a descriptive research design and purposive sampling. Multiple sources of evidence was used to collect information mainly literature review, questionnaires and interviews. Key findings reveal that legal and statutory requirements in the formation of joint ventures include registration by Business Registration and Licensing Agency (BRELA), Contractors Registration Board (CRB) and under Registration of Documents Act (RDA). All JV respondents were registered by BRELA and CRB which are mandatory but only 7 were registered by RDA. Most important factors considered during formation of JVs are: contract agreement, financial stability and commitment while key risks associated with JVs are cultural and social differences, delays in approvals and financial risks. In addition, main challenges facing joint ventures are: identification of possible risks and joint venture agreement interpretation. The study concludes that formation of JVs have been addressing some of emerging challenges facing local construction organizations despite the risks and challenges that exist. The study recommends that firms entering joint ventures should explore the benefits of registering with RDA and ensure risks associated with their JV are properly assessed.

It is remarkable that the word “social” came into use not before the publication of Rousseau’s “Contrat social” in 1762. The Encyclopédie of the French Enlightenment recorded the word “social” in 1765 as “a word recently introduced in language to designate the qualities that make man useful in society or fitting for the commerce of men”. The Oikos of citizens was dissolving into the space of their outer activities, releasing, on the one hand, economic action into the market exchange and, on the other hand, tasks of care and supply into the public space, which the citizens filled with their societies.|$|E

40|$|Vacation recreation, {{especially}} {{in the form of}} organized services for employees, is an important element of social policy of the State. However, the activity of many recreational centers owned by the employing institutions is characterized by low social and economic efficiency. The increase in that efficiency can be achieved mostly by means of economic and organizational tools, provided that certain conditions, both external (i. e. not pertaining to a recreational center) and internal (i. e. concerning the center), are met. It has been assumed that recreational centers should be run on an internal self-supporting basis, with self-financing as a tool of increasing the economic efficiency. It is indispensable to use all ways of reducing the costs of exploitation, eg. through <b>joint</b> <b>undertakings</b> with other centers, rationalizing employment and offering services on the open market. The changes in the system of managing the recreational centers should bring about a considerable increase in their economic efficiency; in turn, such increase should ensure the growth of social effect of vacation services.

40|$|Concerns about {{environmental}} quality, social equity, economic vitality, {{and the threat}} of climate change have converged to produce a growing interest in the concept of sustainable development. Efforts are being made {{all over the world to}} increase the sustainability of development patterns. In nations with more advanced economies, particular attention is being paid to the critical roles played by transportation, land use, and activity systems. This paper reviews current thinking about sustainable transportation as part of a broader strategy of transportation and land use planning for sustainability. Strategies for increasing transportation sustainability include demand management, operations management, pricing policies, vehicle technology improvements, clean fuels, and integrated land use and transportation planning. In the past, planning and implementation of such strategies has been slow and spotty, deterred by the complexities of the underlying issues along with uncertainties about the magnitude and timing of impacts, the efficacy of available courses of action, and the consequences of action or inaction. Recently, however, a new interest in actively pursuing these strategies has emerged. Regional planners are increasingly being asked to take a leadership role in these planning efforts, applying their expertise to analysis of the issues and creating forums for discussion, conflict resolution, and <b>joint</b> <b>undertakings.</b> The paper concludes with an identification of topics deserving additional research, as well as a detailed bibliography on sustainable development topics...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} industry operates {{primarily as a}} system of sub-contracting and purpose built alliances. There is {{a wide spread of}} stakeholders involved in conceiving a building project through typical stages such as design, finance, build,  manage, upgrade and, ultimately, replacement and a corresponding need for communication and cooperation. Specialists who can prevent bridges falling down or who build 20 storey buildings are seen as the hard-nosed, action people who have helped bring us into the modern era. However, there are intuitive activities and disciplines which help us to achieve the type of construction achievements that have been the hallmarks of the 19 th, 20 th and now the 21 st centuries. Most of these so called soft disciplines are about how one helps people, often highly skilled, achieve those construction and engineering goals. The key components are consultation and communication. Communication strategies should be based on a thorough understanding of the ways that humans co-operate in <b>joint</b> <b>undertakings,</b> the key principles of social dynamics and learning theory plus the ways in which people deliver, accept and understand words and pictures. The disciplines of organisational and environmental psychology have become a basic fundamental of modern business activities from management and organisational strategy to marketing and customer relations and to the improvement of working, recreational and living environments. However it is rare for a mature industry such as construction to adopt or examine those disciplines for guidance about either strategies or operations. This is {{despite the fact that the}} {{construction industry}} is almost entirely based on the principle of sub-contracting, business and professional alliances, all of which require understanding of environmental psychology and social dynamics in order to build trust, reputation, teamwork and client satisfaction. There is therefore a major need for communications to be systematic, understood by all stakeholders and intelligently applied. This paper concentrates on the need for the client to become a more confident and better informed stakeholder in the construction project, and seeks to provide high level management guidance for traditional centralized systems. The ultimate goal of the paper is to provide a systematic guideline for stakeholders to address early in the life of a project to ensure that industry professionals, clients and sub-clients are “working from the same page...|$|E
