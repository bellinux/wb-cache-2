The easement can be for a personal use (for example, an easement to use a boat ramp) or a commercial use (for example, an easement to a railroad company to build and maintain a rail line across property). Historically, an <b>easement</b> <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> was neither assignable nor inheritable, but commercial easements are now freely transferable to a third party. They are divisible but must be exclusive (the original owner no longer uses it and exclusive to easement holder) and all holders of the easement must agree to divide.

40|$|The {{concept of}} an {{interest}} 2 ̆ 2 running 2 ̆ 2 with particular realty is employed in connection with assignments of easements and profits to develop rules which are reasonably clear and free from dispute in most situations. The burden, on the servient land passes with such land to all takers thereof. In theory {{this end of the}} easement or profit runs with the servient tenement itself, rather than merely with an estate therein, and hence is binding upon even adverse possessors of the freehold. The benefit of an easement appurtenant to some dominant tenement passes freely therewith even without separate mention. The benefit of a profit appurtenant passes in similar fashion. The only limitation is that the servient land must not be 2 ̆ 2 surcharged, 2 ̆ 2 or unduly burdened, by certain transfers as described below. s The benefit of a profit <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> is freely assignable from one person to another, subject only to the rule that where assigned to more than one the new takers must 2 ̆ 2 work together with one stock 2 ̆ 2 that is, in common as one person. But when we come to <b>easements</b> <b>in</b> <b>gross,</b> a serious difference of opinion exists on the question {{whether or not they are}} transferable. A large portion of this essay will be devoted to a consideration of this particular problem...|$|R

50|$|A {{structural}} encroachment is {{a concept}} in American real property law, in which a piece of real property hangs from one property over the property line of another landowner's premises. The actual structure that encroaches might be a tree, bush, bay window, stairway, steps, stoop, garage, leaning fence, part of a building, or other fixture. Some attorneys classify it {{as a type of}} easement, related to an <b>easement</b> <b>in</b> <b>gross,</b> while some scholars classify such as one type of encroachment.|$|E
50|$|In Gross. By contrast, {{a profit}} in gross can be {{assigned}} or otherwise transferred by its owner.

Profits can also be exclusive (guaranteeing {{the owner of the}} profit that no other person will be given the right to collect the specified resources on the land).|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the legal {{institute}} of easements. These are rights in rem to another person's property which restrict the owner of immovable property {{in favor of a}}nother person so that he is obliged to tolerate something, to refrain from something or to perform something. Easements serve more beneficial usage of immovable property or in favor of a particular person. The thesis consists of ten chapters. The first chapter describes the historical development of <b>easements</b> <b>in</b> five sub-chapters. The second chapter {{deals with the}} definition and function of easements. The third chapter examines their sorting. The fourth chapter deals with the content of easements. The most common easements - the right of way and the right to use a flat or a room - are described in two sub-chapters. The fifth chapter deals with an issue of recording <b>easements</b> <b>in</b> the land register. The sixth chapter, the largest, successively pays attention to individual ways of their creation in six sub-chapters. In three sub-chapters of the seventh chapter modification of <b>easements</b> (<b>in</b> their subjects, content and object) is analysed. The eighth chapter examines individual ways of termination of <b>easements</b> <b>in</b> six sub-chapters. Separately, in the ninth chapter, limitation of time of easements is dealt with.

In addition, the Land Trust hosted two workshops in Kingston and Epping for landowners interested in learning more about the tax and financial benefits of land conservation. Workshop invitations were mailed to more than 1, 200 current use landowners within the region. Twenty-two landowners attended the two workshops. From these workshops, the Land Trust generated one donated and one bargain sale conservation <b>easement</b> <b>in</b> 2011 and one potential bargain sale conservation <b>easement</b> <b>in</b> 2012.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to try to}} provide an {{analysis}} of the legislation of <b>easements</b> contained <b>in</b> the Civil Code, {{to take into account the}} case law related to the General Civil Code as well as the recent court decisions and express controversy over some aspects that the new legislation offers. The thesis is divided into four chapters, the first chapter is devoted to a brief definition of easements and the kinds of easements. The second chapter analyzes the historical development of the <b>easements.</b> <b>In</b> the first part of the chapter the Roman law, which was the first to regulate the easements, is discussed. Furthermore, the chapter deals with the development of the easements during the Middle Ages, when the easements were joined by the institute of real burdens. The third part of the chapter discusses the legislation of <b>easements</b> <b>in</b> the General Civil Code, which is an inspiration for the current legislation; the relevant case law is not omitted. Finally, the chapter contains a section dealing with the legislation of <b>easements</b> <b>in</b> the so called Middle Civil Code from 1950 and the legislation in the Civil Code from 1964. The third chapter, which forms the main part of the thesis, is devoted to a detailed analysis of the current legislation of <b>easements</b> contained <b>in</b> the Civil Code.

40|$|The use of exacted {{conservation}} easements is widespread. Yet, {{the study}} of the implications of their use has been minimal. Conservation easements are nonpossessory interests in land restricting a landowner’s ability to use her land in an otherwise permissible way, with the goal of yielding a conservation benefit. Exacted conservation <b>easements</b> arise <b>in</b> permitting contexts where, in exchange for a government benefit, landowners either create conservation easements on their own property or arrange for conservation easements on other land. To explore the concern associated with the enforceability of exacted conservation <b>easements</b> <b>in</b> a concrete way, this article examines exacted conservation <b>easements</b> <b>in</b> California, demonstrating that despite their frequent use in the state, their enforceability is uncertain. The three California statutes governing conservation easements limit the ability to exact conservation easements. California caselaw, although thin, indicates that courts may be willing to uphold exacted conservation easements even when they conflict with the state statutes. This examination of the California situation highlights California-specific concerns while providing a framework for examining exacted conservation <b>easements</b> <b>in</b> other states. This article illustrates not only challenges of enforceability that arise with exacted conservation <b>easements,</b> but uncertainty <b>in</b> their fundamental validity and concerns about public accountability. This exploration illustrates that enforceability is not straightforward. This raises significant concerns about using exacted conservation easements to promote conservation goals, calling into question specifically the use of conservation easements as exactions...|$|R

40|$|Resume <b>in</b> English. <b>Easement</b> <b>in</b> Telecommunication This thesis {{deals with}} the <b>easements</b> <b>in</b> the {{specifically}} chosen and therefore dedicated area - in Telecommunication field. The easement has its primary regulation in the Civil Code No. 64 / 1964 Sb., however the easements are regulated also within the public law area, namely the public law codes e. g. Water Act, Railway Act etc. In its very basic effect they represent the limitation of the property owner. We divide them into two groups easements ad personam and ad rem. The <b>easement</b> <b>in</b> the telecommunication belongs into the public law. They are currently regulated by the Telecommunication Act No. 127 / 2005 which has it's specific procedure of establishing these easements. Before this Act there were two previous Acts - the Act. No. 110 / 1964 Sb. which was replaced by Act No. 151 / 2000 Sb. The Act No. 151 / 2000 Sb was replaced by above mentioned valid act. Each of the Acts maintained the area of <b>easement</b> <b>in</b> different way. When we {{take into consideration the}} first and the oldest Act No. 110 / 1964 Sb. the easements were considered like public limitation of owner rights until the year 1992, when was the Act updated and specifically renamed the public limitation of the owner rights into the easements.
