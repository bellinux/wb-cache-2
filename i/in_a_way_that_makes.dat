5|$|The most {{acclaimed}} of the neo-noirs {{of the era}} {{was director}} Roman Polanski's 1974 Chinatown. Written by Robert Towne, it is set in 1930s Los Angeles, an accustomed noir locale nudged back some few years <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> the pivotal loss of innocence in the story even crueler. Where Polanski and Towne raised noir to a black apogee by turning rearward, director Martin Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader brought the noir attitude crashing into the present day with Taxi Driver (1976), a crackling, bloody-minded gloss on bicentennial America. In 1978, Walter Hill wrote and directed The Driver, a chase film as might have been imagined by Jean-Pierre Melville in an especially abstract mood.|$|E
5|$|Populations from Los Baños {{and from}} Sagada, {{both in the}} Philippines, have {{slightly}} different hunting tactics, and Los Baños has some very dangerous prey spiders. In laboratory tests, Los Baños P. labiatas rely more on trial and error than Sagada P. labiatas in finding ways to vibrate the prey's web and thus lure or distract the prey. Around Los Baños the web-building Scytodes pallida, which preys on jumping spiders, is very abundant. All members of the genus Scytodes spit a sticky gum on prey and potential threats, and this can immobilise a Portia {{long enough for the}} Scytodes to wrap the Portia in silk and then bite it. Around Los Baños, P. labiata instinctively detours round the back of S. pallida that is not carrying eggs while with plucking the web <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> S. pallida believe the threat is in front of it. P. labiata prefers to stalk a female S. pallida carrying eggs, as then S. pallida is reluctant to drop the eggs in order to spit, and in this case P. labiata sometimes uses a direct attack. In areas where S. pallida is absent, the local members of P. labiata do not use this combination of plucking other spiders' webs to deceive the prey and detouring for a stab in the back.|$|E

25|$|The {{ability of}} a fishery to recover from {{overfishing}} depends on whether the ecosystem's conditions are suitable for the recovery. Dramatic changes in species composition can result in an ecosystem shift, where other equilibrium energy flows involve species compositions different from those that had been present before the depletion of the original fish stock. For example, once trout have been overfished, carp might take over <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> {{it impossible for the}} trout to re-establish a breeding population.|$|E
25|$|Questions {{of public}} policy.

For example, an employee suing a foreign corporation in a state of employment, may enjoy the public policy to protect local employees from foreign abusers.

25|$|Reconciliation of {{gene and}} species trees entails mapping {{evolutionary}} events onto gene trees <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> them concordant with the species tree. Different reconciliation models exist, differing {{in the types}} of event they consider to explain the incongruences between gene and species tree topologies. Early methods exclusively modelled horizontal transfers (T). More recent ones also account for duplication (D), loss (L), incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) or homologous recombination (HR) events. The difficulty is that by allowing for multiple types of events, the number of possible reconciliations increases rapidly. For instance, a conflicting gene tree topologies might be explained in terms of a single HGT event or multiple duplication and loss events. Both alternatives can be considered plausible reconciliation depending on the frequency of these respective events along the species tree.|$|E

500|$|... "Providence" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity awarded the episode a B+ rating. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it a 9 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode took the promising {{beginning of the}} last episode and delivered a strong and surprising larger meaning to {{the pieces of the}} mythology we’ve seen over the past few seasons.

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series.

He thought the performances were fairly solid and that the overall message about the ozone layer was [...] "unsubtle but not too sledgehammery". DeCandido praised Patrick Stewart's performance of Captain Picard, noting that his [...] "anger and outrage and justified self-righteousness at the kidnapping of children modulates nicely into diplomacy when negotiating with the Aldeans and amusingly into total discomfort when he has to actually deal directly with the children". He gave the episode a score of six out of ten. James Hunt, writing for Den of Geek, said that it was [...] "a decent enough story, but not <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> you want to watch it".

A few years later David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel discovered cells in the primary visual cortex of monkeys that become active when sharp edges move across specific points in the field of view—a discovery for which they won a Nobel Prize. Follow-up studies in higher-order visual areas found cells that detect binocular disparity, color, movement, and aspects of shape, with areas located at increasing distances from the primary visual cortex showing increasingly complex responses. Other investigations of brain areas unrelated to vision have revealed cells with a wide variety of response correlates, some related to memory, some to abstract types of cognition such as space.|$|E
500|$|The show resembles Desperate Housewives in many ways, {{including}} {{having a}} [...] "pilot" [...] that revolves around a death, according to Daily News critic David Hinckley.

Hinckley lauded the show by saying [...] "... a Cherry drama rises or falls on the pretty simple test of whether it’s fun, and 'Devious Maids' has the right stuff to get to there." [...] Alessandra Stanley, the chief television critic for The New York Times, at first described the show as a [...] "landmark" [...] where the rich [...] "Beverly Hills employers are mere foils for the real heroines, who are poor, Hispanic and striving: desperate housekeepers."
