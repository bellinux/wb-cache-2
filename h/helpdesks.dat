40|$|As the English Higher Education system {{responds}} {{to changes in}} funding and student choice, there is increased expectation on universities to provide higher quality services to students and to function more efficiently and effectively. One of the key areas where universities need to rise to these challenges is in their internal helpdesk service provision (Palaneeswaran and Kumaraswamy, 2000), where lessons can be learnt from private sector service provision. This paper therefore discusses the commonalities and differences of service provision {{between the public and}} private sectors, the particular distinct circumstances and difficulties associated with operating <b>helpdesks</b> in academic environments (Middleton and Marcella, 1996), and finally the paper identifies best practice and benchmarking standards within private sector helpdesk provision which can be applied to university <b>helpdesks</b> and potentially to other public sector organisations. The best practice standards and frameworks referred to in this paper are SDI (Service Desk Institute) standards, ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) Service Management, and COBIT (Control OBjectives for Information and related Technologies), and provide opportunities for benchmarking to be applied within academic <b>helpdesks...</b>|$|E

Handoffs are common in these sensemaking situations due to shift changes, because a different skill or perspective is needed or simply because the current sensemaker may be exhausted.

This could be true because sensemaking involves non-routine activities for which no structural support for handoff may exist, or because sensemakers may not be sure what to handoff if sensemaking is not complete. This study examined the issues related to sensemaking handoff in computer support <b>helpdesks.</b> Existing theories of sensemaking (Russell et al, 1993 and Weick, 1996) were used as a framework. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with two different computer helpdesk personnel groups at a large mid-western university. Successful handoffs occurred either very early or very late in the sensemaking process. This choice of handoff time as well as other aspects of handoffs are discussed using the principles of least collaborative effort [13] and mindfulness [18]...|$|E

40|$|Contractual <b>helpdesk</b> services, {{also known}} as call center {{outsourcing}} is a growing industry.   <b>Helpdesk</b> solutions, which offer customer service to consumers who have an issue, problem or concern, {{are an integral part}} of many organizations’ wider service function.   For smaller companies, outsourcing <b>helpdesk</b> services is becoming more and more popular given the technical expertise and high investment costs required to develop, implement and maintain the infrastructure needed to support these services.   Contracting for <b>helpdesk</b> services helps to alleviate smaller companies from concerns with technical issues, retaining employees dedicated to continuous research on the value proposition of emerging products or services, and in some cases, the need for hiring additional staff.   While the basic principles for negotiating an outsourcing contract apply, this paper explores the special considerations pertinent to contracting <b>helpdesk</b> services. These include determining an optimal solution by mapping business requirements to specific call center resource options, determining the optimal call routing structure given budgetary considerations and understanding technical problems associated with the call center environment and developing a satisficing plan to address problems should they occur.   As the technologies, including telecommunications and call routing options, that form the basis of <b>helpdesk</b> services evolve, so does the importance of <b>helpdesk</b> services as they move from cost centers to profit generating ventures.   </p...|$|R

40|$|Importance of {{adopting}} Information Technology {{into the business}} processes is a strategic decision taken {{by most of the}} modern day organizations. But there are many evidence that even though organizations spend a lot in IT, the expectations are not delivered. Mismanagement is identified as a main reason for this gap between the expectation and the reality. To minimize this gap, many organizations follow best practices such as IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL). Within ITIL, IT helpdesk is considered as a key element which combines the rest of the processes defined under ITIL. Keeping the role of IT <b>helpdesks</b> in IT service management, this research attempts to understand the impact of <b>helpdesks</b> on the factors affecting productivity. More precisely the research scope was defined to focus the diversified holdings in Sri Lanka. Diversified holdings, by nature operate in multiple business verticals. This makes them to use various information systems to support the business functions adding complexity to the IT environment. This is the main reason of focusing diversified holdings during this research. This research managed to identify the current methods used by the IT end users and IT support teams in a case where support is needed. It has also identified several limitations of these traditional methods used. Going forward this research has identified the positive impact made by the features & processes available with IT helpdesk towards improving the productivity. Towards the latter part of this research, several guidelines are suggested, which can be used during a successful deployment of IT helpdesk. This section also includes the feature expectations of both IT end users and IT support teams. In summary, this research has identified the limitations of the existing methods of requesting IT support and the features available with the IT helpdesk to eliminate these limitations. It also has identified the positive impact of the IT helpdesk on the labor productivity. With the intension of deploying better IT <b>helpdesks,</b> several practical guidelines also were proposed based on the analysis done using collected data...|$|E
