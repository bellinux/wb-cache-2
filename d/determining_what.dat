5|$|In {{practical}} terms, horses {{prefer to}} eat {{small amounts of}} food steadily throughout the day, {{as they do in}} nature when grazing on pasture. Although this is not always possible with modern stabling practices and human schedules that favor feeding horses twice a day, {{it is important to remember}} the underlying biology of the animal when <b>determining</b> <b>what</b> to feed, how often, and in what quantities.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the player}} has no direct {{control over the}} patients, they have some {{influence}} over whether to evict them from the hospital and in <b>determining</b> <b>what</b> {{to do with them}} when given a choice by the staff. The player can pick up any staff member in the building and move them (mainly to reassign them to another room or send them to get rest), or dismiss them if they argue about pay or are no longer required. The player may force patients to take a chance at a cure for their suspected disease before diagnosis is complete (at the risk of killing the patient), and rearrange queues.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{distinctive}} features of Golden Sun is the collection and manipulation of creatures called Djinn. The Djinn are scattered in hiding throughout the game; once found, they can be allocated to each character. They {{form the basis of}} the game's statistic enhancement, as well as the system that dictates the character's Psynergy capabilities. Attaching different Djinn to different characters modifies that character's character class, subsequently modifying hit points, Psynergy points, and other statistics, as well as <b>determining</b> <b>what</b> Psynergy the character is able to perform.|$|E

One popular answer to the first question is that the facts that <b>determine</b> <b>what</b> we mean are the facts about our usage. 1 Thi...|$|R

5|$|Rhyme {{consists}} of identical ("hard-rhyme") or similar ("soft-rhyme") sounds {{placed at the}} ends of lines or at predictable locations within lines ("internal rhyme"). Languages vary in the richness of their rhyming structures; Italian, for example, has a rich rhyming structure permitting maintenance of a limited set of rhymes throughout a lengthy poem. The richness results from word endings that follow regular forms. English, with its irregular word endings adopted from other languages, is less rich in rhyme. The degree of richness of a language's rhyming structures plays a substantial role in <b>determining</b> <b>what</b> poetic forms are commonly used in that language.|$|E
5|$|The {{integers}} {{have additional}} properties {{which do not}} generalize to all commutative rings. An important example is the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which says that every positive integer can be factored uniquely into prime numbers. Unique factorizations do not always exist in other rings, but Noether found a unique factorization theorem, now called the Lasker–Noether theorem, for the ideals of many rings. Much of Noether's work lay in <b>determining</b> <b>what</b> properties do hold for all rings, in devising novel analogs of the old integer theorems, and in determining the minimal set of assumptions required to yield certain properties of rings.|$|E
5|$|Regarding battle, Golden Sun games contain both random monster encounters, {{featuring}} {{randomly selected}} enemies, and compulsory battles involving set enemies, which advance the story. When a battle begins, a separate screen is brought {{up where the}} player's party and enemy party face-off on opposing sides. During a battle, the characters and the background rotate to give a pseudo-3D effect. Players can attack enemies directly {{using a variety of}} weapons and offensive Psynergy spells, or by summoning Djinn, powerful other-worldly entities that enhance an attached character's hit points, Psynergy points, and other statistics, as well as <b>determining</b> <b>what</b> Psynergy the character is able to perform. Djinns can be set to standby, where players forfeit stat enhancements in order to unleash a powerful one-time attack where the player summons an elemental monster to inflict damage on every enemy.|$|E

5|$|The adult jaguar is an apex predator, {{meaning it}} exists {{at the top}} of its food chain and is not preyed on in the wild. The jaguar has also been termed a {{keystone}} species, as it is assumed, through controlling the population levels of prey such as herbivorous and granivorous mammals, apex felids maintain the structural integrity of forest systems. However, accurately <b>determining</b> <b>what</b> effect species like the jaguar have on ecosystems is difficult, because data must be compared from regions where the species is absent as well as its current habitats, while controlling for the effects of human activity. It is accepted that mid-sized prey species undergo population increases {{in the absence of the}} keystone predators, and this has been hypothesized to have cascading negative effects. However, field work has shown this may be natural variability and the population increases may not be sustained. Thus, the keystone predator hypothesis is not accepted by all scientists.|$|E
5|$|Ursa Minor is {{bordered by}} Camelopardalis to the west, Draco to the west, and Cepheus to the east. Covering 256square degrees, it ranks 56th of the 88 constellations in size. Ursa Minor is colloquially {{known in the}} US as the Little Dipper because its seven {{brightest}} stars seem to form {{the shape of a}} dipper (ladle or scoop). The star {{at the end of the}} dipper handle is Polaris. Polaris can also be found by following a line through the two stars—Alpha and Beta Ursae Majoris—that form the end of the 'bowl' of the Big Dipper, for 30 degrees (three upright fists at arms' length) across the night sky. The four stars constituting the bowl of the Little Dipper are of second, third, fourth, and fifth magnitudes, and provide an easy guide to <b>determining</b> <b>what</b> magnitude stars are visible, useful for city dwellers or testing one's eyesight.|$|E
