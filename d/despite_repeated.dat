By 1148 Manuel had seen the wisdom of securing an alliance with Conrad, whose sister-in-law Bertha of Sulzbach he had earlier married; he actually persuaded the German king to renew their alliance against Roger II of Sicily. Unfortunately for the Byzantine emperor, Conrad died in 1152, and <b>despite</b> <b>repeated</b> attempts, Manuel could not reach an agreement with his successor, Frederick I Barbarossa.|$|E
5|$|SCSFLS afflicts 5 out {{of every}} 100,000 people. On average, the {{condition}} is developed {{at the age of}} 42, and women are twice as likely as men to develop the condition. Some people with SCSFLS chronically leak cerebrospinal fluid <b>despite</b> <b>repeated</b> attempts at patching, leading to long-term disability due to pain. SCSFLS was first described by German neurologist Georg Schaltenbrand in 1938 and by American physician Henry Woltman of the Mayo Clinic in the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|The {{presidency}} of Taraki, albeit short-lived, was always marked by controversies. Taraki launched a land reform on 1 January 1979 which {{proved to be}} highly unpopular and, along with his government's other reforms, led to a popular backlash which initiated the Afghan civil war. <b>Despite</b> <b>repeated</b> attempts throughout his reign, Taraki proved unable to persuade the Soviet Union to intervene {{in support of the}} restoration of civil order.|$|E

5|$|In the 1780s, Catherine {{slightly}} favored Poniatowski {{over the}} opposition, {{but did not}} support any of his plans for significant reforms. <b>Despite</b> <b>repeated</b> attempts, Poniatowski failed to confederate the sejms, which would have made them immune to liberum veto. Thus, although he had {{a majority in the}} Sejms, Poniatowski was unable to pass even the smallest reform. The Zamoyski Code was rejected by the Sejm of 1780, and opposition attacks on the king dominated the Sejms of 1782 and 1786.|$|E

Although cardiac catheterization revealed normal coronary arteries, computed tomography revealed a 4 cm × 9 cm multinodular goiter extending into the mediastinum and compressing the trachea.

40|$|We {{report a}} case of {{embryonal}} orbital rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) in a five year old boy. Immuno-histochemistry of incisional specimen confirmed diagnosis. Eight cycles of chemotherapy along with radiotherapy resulted in over 50 % reduction in size of the mass. However, increase in size was noted subsequent to completion of therapy and exenteration was deemed prudent. Margins of the excised specimen were free from tumor cells, but after five months, the patient developed multiple metastases, including skeletal muscle involvement, and died nine months after exenteration, <b>despite</b> <b>repeat</b> chemotherapy along with radiotherapy. Orbital RMS with metastasis to skeletal muscle is a rare entity...|$|R

The ship played a minor role in the Pacific War, supporting Japanese forces during Philippines Campaign until she struck a mine. She returned to Japan in 1943 and again became a training ship for naval cadets. Izumo was sunk by American carrier aircraft during the attack on Kure in July 1945.

5|$|This forced Tiridates {{to confront}} the Romans with his army, as they {{approached}} Artaxata. The Roman force, reinforced by a vexillatio of X Fretensis, marched in a hollow square, with the legions supported by auxiliary horsemen and foot archers. The Roman soldiers were under strict orders not to break formation, and <b>despite</b> <b>repeated</b> probing attacks and feigned retreats by the Parthian horse archers, they held together until nightfall. During the night, Tiridates withdrew his army, abandoning his capital; its inhabitants promptly surrendered and were allowed to leave unmolested, but the city was torched, since the Romans could not spare sufficient men for garrisoning it.|$|E

Following his release in 1966, Speer published two bestselling autobiographical works, Inside the Third Reich and , detailing his close personal relationship with Hitler, and providing readers and historians with a unique perspective on the workings of the Nazi regime. He later wrote a third book, Infiltration, about the SS. Speer died of a stroke in 1981 while on a visit to London.|$|E
5|$|An {{advocate}} for universal and single-payer health care, Wolf is {{a supporter of}} both Massachusetts health care reform and President Barack Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA).

Wolf's further statements on the positive aspects of PPACA were eventually cut short by Chairman Darrell Issa, a staunch PPACA opponent. Wolf supported a failed amendment in 2012 which would have implemented single-payer health care in Massachusetts if a study proved it was more effective in reducing costs than the state's current model.|$|E

5|$|Blackrock is a play by Australian playwright Nick Enright {{that was}} first {{performed}} in 1995. It {{was adapted from}} a 1992 play by Enright, entitled A Property of the Clan, which {{was inspired by the}} murder of Leigh Leigh in Stockton, Australia in 1989. The plays were both well received critically, though they did attract criticism from both Leigh's family and the media due to the fictionalisation of an actual murder. <b>Despite</b> <b>repeated</b> statements from Enright that the plays were a work of fiction, they have both often been considered by viewers to be a factual account. A Property of the Clan was shortlisted for a New South Wales Premier's Literary Award in 1993, and Blackrock won the AWGIE Award for Best Play in 1996. Blackrock was developed into a feature film of the same name in 1997.|$|E
5|$|<b>Despite</b> <b>repeated</b> efforts, the French Navy {{failed to}} {{reinforce}} and resupply the garrison, as their ships were intercepted and defeated either in European waters {{or in the}} Caribbean itself. The British had intercepted {{a number of these}} messages, and launched a series of successful invasions during 1809, until Guadeloupe was the only French colony remaining. A British expeditionary force landed on 28 January 1810, and found that much of the island's militia garrison had deserted. Advancing from two landing beaches {{on opposite sides of the}} island, they were able to rapidly push inland. It was not until they reached Beaupère–St. Louis Ridge outside the capital Basse-Terre that the expeditionary force faced strong opposition, but in a battle lasting for most of 3 February, the French were defeated and driven back. The island's commander, Jean Augustin Ernouf, began surrender negotiations the following day.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, Hawker Siddeley Aviation (HSA) was keen {{to develop a}} new {{generation}} of combat aircraft that would be capable of supersonic speeds. Unfortunately, <b>despite</b> <b>repeated</b> attempts to revive the program, the in-development Hawker P.1121 fighter would ultimately be left unfinished, principally {{due to a lack of}} a political support for development following the release of the 1957 Defence White Paper by Minister of Defence Duncan Sandys. Recognising the need to promptly commence work on another development program, HSA's chief aircraft designer Sir Sydney Camm, who had been in regular discussions with Sir Stanley Hooker of Bristol Aero Engines, decided that the company should investigate the prospects of developing and manufacturing a viable combat-capable vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) fighter aircraft.|$|E
