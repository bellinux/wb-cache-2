The school was governed by a <b>Joint</b> <b>Administrative</b> <b>Committee</b> composed equally of industry women (such as Rose Schneiderman, {{who served on the}} committee for three years) and women of Bryn Mawr (faculty, administrators, and alumni). The School Council, which met once a week to plan school activities, consisted of seven students, three administrators, and three faculty. Regional committees, also composed equally of industry and Bryn Mawr women, were tasked with recruiting and fundraising. Funding was provided by a diverse group of supporters that included John D. Rockefeller Jr. and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America.|$|E
