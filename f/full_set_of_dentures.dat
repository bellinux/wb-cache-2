5|$|Moore {{was born}} in Pinner, Middlesex on 4 March 1923 to Capt. Charles Trachsel Caldwell-Moore MC (died 1947) and Gertrude (née White) (died 1981). His family moved to Bognor Regis, and {{subsequently}} to East Grinstead where he spent his childhood. His youth was marked by heart problems, which left him in poor health and he was educated at home by private tutors. He developed an interest in astronomy {{at the age of}} six and joined the British Astronomical Association at the age of eleven. He was invited to run a small observatory in East Grinstead at the age of 14, after his mentor – who ran the observatory – was killed in a road accident. At the age of 16 he began wearing a monocle after an oculist told him his right eye was weaker than his left. Three years later, he began wearing a <b>full</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>dentures.</b>|$|E

This study aims to compare two impression materials for effectiveness and cost effectiveness. Methods/Design IMPROVDENT is a double-blind crossover trial comparing the use of alginate and silicone, two commonly used denture impression materials, in terms of patient preference and cost-effectiveness. Eighty five edentulous patients will be recruited and provided with two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>dentures,</b> similar in all aspects except for the impression material used (alginate or silicone). Patients will try both <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>dentures</b> for a two-week period, unadjusted, to become accustomed to the feel <b>of</b> the new <b>dentures</b> (habituation period). Patients will then wear each <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>dentures</b> for a period of 8 weeks (in random order) during which time the dentures will be adjusted for optimum comfort. Finally, patients will be given both <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>dentures</b> for a further two weeks to wear whichever denture they prefer (confirmation period). Patients will be asked about quality of life and to rate dentures on function and comfort {{at the end of each}} trial period and asked which set they prefer at the end of the habituation period (unadjusted denture preference) and confirmation period (adjusted denture preference).

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} 6 dental statuses as {{risk factors}} for malnutrition in geriatric patients admitted to a convalescent and rehabilitation hospital. Materials and Methods: One hundred twenty (59 men and 61 women) geriatric patients admitted to a convalescent and rehabilitation hospital were recruited. Three biochemical and hematologic parameters (albumin, hemoglobin, and lymphocyte count) were used for analysis. Malnutrition was defined as Body Mass Index (BMI) below 18. 5 and albumin level under 35 g/L. The number of natural or prosthetic teeth in the dentate patients, {{and the presence of}} one or both dentures in the edentate patients, were recorded. Risk factors associated with malnutrition were investigated, namely: (1) edentulism among all patients, (2) edentulism without a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> complete <b>dentures</b> among all patients, (3) edentulism without a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> complete <b>dentures</b> among the edentate patients, (4) decreased number (. 05). The status of edentate patients without a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> complete <b>dentures</b> compared with other edentate and dentate patients was the only independent risk factor (P <. 05) in the 6 statuses studied. Conclusion: Primary healthcare workers caring for hospitalized geriatric patients should identify edentate patients without a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> complete <b>dentures</b> for the possibility of malnutrition. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Ninety edentulous patients (Cawood class IV and V, mean mandibular height 20. 7 +/- 2. 7 mm) {{were randomly assigned to}} one of these treatment modalities. The main outcome parameters were denture satisfaction and chewing ability, which were assessed using validated self-administered questionnaires focusing on denture-related complaints and problems with chewing different types of food. These parameters were measured before treatment, and 1, 5 and 10 years after treatment. Differences among the three groups were tested by applying a one way analysis of variance and a Tukey's test for multiple comparison. At the I year evaluation, significantly better scores were observed in the two surgical groups (IRO, PPS) than in the CD group (...|$|R
40|$|Making {{complete}} dentures for dental {{research is}} difficult.
