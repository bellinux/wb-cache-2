5|$|Clement IX had {{primarily}} named Italian cardinals to the college, only appointing one French and one Spanish cardinal when {{he needed}} their assistance to fight back an invasion by the Ottoman Empire in Crete. He created his friends cardinals, with seven of the twelve that he created coming <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>native</b> Tuscany. Clement did not feel obligated to appoint a German cardinal because the Holy Roman Emperor had requested his assistance in Hungary. Within days of his death Clement IX had created seven additional cardinals, which brought the number of potential electors to its maximum number of seventy.|$|E
5|$|Tallon {{married his}} first wife Marjorie Beattie in 1946. The {{constant}} travel, interstate and overseas, took a toll on his marriage and the pair divorced in 1950. In 1954, he married Lynda Kirchner <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>native</b> Bundaberg, {{with whom he had}} two daughters. In retirement, Tallon helped his younger brother Mat in running a corner store in Bundaberg. His nephew Ross played one match for Queensland Colts in 196768.

5|$|These benefices {{provided}} an income without {{the obligation to}} perform any pastoral services. Their revenues were assigned {{to pay for his}} studies, leaving poorly paid vicars to carry out the pastoral work. Walter remained as a teacher and official at Orléans, perhaps without returning to Scotland at all, until the late 1350s, by when he would have been absent <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>native</b> country for more than 25years. In an Aberdeen document dated 12 July 1356, it was noted that he was still absent from his post.|$|E
5|$|Also {{a younger}} son, Gebhard had {{prepared}} for an ecclesiastical career with a broad, Humanist education; apart <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>native</b> German, {{he had learned}} several languages (including Latin, Italian, French), and studied history and theology. After studying at the universities of Dillingen, Ingolstadt, Perugia, Louvain and elsewhere, he began his ecclesiastical career in 1560at Augsburg. His conduct at Augsburg caused some scandal; the bishop, his uncle, petitioned the Duke of Bavaria to remonstrate with him about it, which apparently led to some improvement in his behavior. In 1561, he became a deacon at Cologne Cathedral (1561–77), a canon of St. Gereon, the basilica in Cologne (1562–67), a canon in Strassburg (1567–1601), in Ellwangen (1567–83), and in Würzburg (1569–70). In 1571, he became deacon of Strassburg Cathedral, a position he held until his death. In 1576, by papal nomination, he also became provost of the Cathedral in Augsburg. Similar to his opponent, these positions brought him influence and wealth; they {{had little to do}} with his priestly character.|$|E
5|$|An {{emigrant}} <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>native</b> Belgium, {{he arrived}} in the New York area in 1897 and dabbled in several technical fields before hitting upon instant coffee manufacture during a sojourn in Central America in 1906 or 1907. He began selling his coffee in 1909 and founded a company to manufacture it in 1910. Based in New York and New Jersey, his company prospered and became an important military supplier during World War I. The company's products were also advertised in New York newspapers and on the radio. The success of his company made Washington wealthy, and {{he lived in a}} mansion in Brooklyn and then moved to a country estate in New Jersey in 1927. In that same year, he lost a dispute with the tax authorities. Washington was married and had three children.|$|E

5|$|On 19 February 1917, in {{a tribute}} <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>native</b> city, Ball became an Honorary Freeman of Nottingham. Around {{this time he}} met James McCudden, also on leave, who later {{reported}} his impressions in most favourable terms. In London, Ball also encountered Canadian pilot Billy Bishop, who had not as yet seen combat. He immediately liked Bishop, and may have helped the latter secure a posting to No.60 Squadron. On 25 March, while off-duty, Ball met 18-year-old Flora Young. He impulsively invited her to fly with him, and she promptly accepted, wearing a leather flying coat that they had borrowed. On 5 April, they became engaged; she wore his silver identification wrist bracelet in lieu of an engagement ring.|$|E
5|$|Phan {{initially}} rallied support <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>native</b> {{village and}} set up his headquarters on Mount Vũ Quang, which overlooked the coastal French fortress at Hà Tĩnh. Phan's organisation became a model for future insurgents. For flexibility, he divided his operational zone into twelve districts. His forces upheld military discipline and wore uniforms. Phan initially used the local scholar-gentry as his military commanders. Their first notable attack targeted two nearby Catholic villages that had collaborated with French forces. Colonial troops arrived a few hours later, quickly overwhelming the rebels and forcing them to retreat to their home village, where the retribution was heavy. Phan managed to escape but his elder brother was captured by the same former viceroy of northern Vietnam who {{had been removed from}} office as a result of Phan's critical report. The disgraced official was now a French collaborator, serving as the governor of Nghệ An Province.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting Friedrich's {{patriotism and}} resentment during the 1813 French {{occupation}} of the dominion of Pomerania, motifs from German folklore became increasingly prominent in his work. An anti-French German nationalist, Friedrich used motifs <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>native</b> landscape to celebrate Germanic culture, customs and mythology. He {{was impressed by the}} anti-Napoleonic poetry of Ernst Moritz Arndt and Theodor Körner, and the patriotic literature of Adam Müller and Heinrich von Kleist. Moved by the deaths of three friends killed in battle against France, as well as by Kleist's 1808 drama Die Hermannsschlacht, Friedrich undertook a number of paintings in which he intended to convey political symbols solely by means of the landscape—a first in the history of art.|$|E

5|$|The {{religion}} {{was born in}} Iran, where it has faced ongoing persecution since its inception. It grew from the mid-19th century Bábí religion, whose founder taught that God would soon send a prophet {{in the manner of}} Jesus or Muhammad. In 1863, after being banished <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>native</b> Iran, Bahá'u'lláh announced that he was this prophet. He was further exiled, spending over a decade in the prison city of Akka in the Ottoman province of Syria, in what is now Israel. Following Bahá'u'lláh's death in 1892, leadership of the religion fell to his son `Abdu'l-Bahá (1844-1921), and later his great-grandson Shoghi Effendi (1897-1957). Bahá'ís around the world annually elect local, regional, and national Spiritual Assemblies that govern the affairs of the religion, and every five years the members of all National Spiritual Assemblies elect the Universal House of Justice, the nine-member supreme governing institution of the worldwide Bahá'í community, which sits in Haifa, Israel near the shrine of Báb.|$|E
5|$|With {{the team}} in the Premier League, {{there was a need}} to rebuild the team. Oxford United player Joey Beauchamp was {{recruited}} for a fee of £1.2 million. Shortly after arriving at the club, however, he became unhappy, citing homesickness <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>native</b> Oxford as the reason. Bonds in particular found this attitude hard to understand compared to his own committed, never-say-die approach; providing for Bonds' further evidence of the decay in the modern game and modern player. Fifty-eight days later, Beauchamp was signed by Swindon Town for a club-record combined fee of £800,000 which included defender Adrian Whitbread going in the opposite direction. Whitbread was valued at £750,000 in the deal.|$|E
5|$|Charles met Frederick Kemp, a {{land agent}} newly arrived in Poulton <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>native</b> Essex, and {{introduced}} him to his brother, {{who was on the}} lookout for a steward or agent. Kemp, well-dressed and charming, made a good impression on Hesketh, who employed him immediately. At the meeting of the railway committee Hesketh put forward a persuasive argument. Despite opposition from the Lytham contingent the committee decided that Rossall Point was the best place for the railway terminus to be built, and the Railway and Port Company was formed. In the early 19th century it was thought that steam locomotives would be unable to negotiate hilly terrain, and that Lake District hills like Shap Fell would prevent the railway from reaching Scotland. The Fylde terminus would have even more importance than Hesketh had hoped, providing a sea link for passengers from London to travel on to Scotland. Initially Hesketh had considered naming his new town New Liverpool or Wyreton, but after changing his name to Hesketh-Fleetwood in 1831 he decided to call it Fleetwood. With a new career in parliament to prepare for, he readily handed over financial management of the project to his manager, Frederick Kemp.|$|E

5|$|Henry B. Payne (November 30, 1810September 9, 1896) was an American {{politician}} from Ohio. Moving to Ohio <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>native</b> New York in 1833, {{he quickly}} established himself {{in law and}} business while becoming a local leader in Democratic politics. After serving in the Ohio Senate, Payne was elected to a single term in the United States House of Representatives in 1874. In the House, he worked unsuccessfully for a compromise {{in the debate over}} whether all of the nation's currency should be backed by gold. He was defeated for reelection, but served on the Electoral Commission that convened in early 1877 to resolve the dispute over the results of the 1876 presidential election. He ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1880, but lost to Winfield Scott Hancock, who would go on to lose the general election to James A. Garfield. He was elected to the United States Senate in 1884. His election by the Ohio legislature was tainted with charges of bribery, but after investigation by the Senate, Payne was permitted to keep his seat. In the Senate, he voted for moderate tariff reforms and against the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, but was otherwise a reliable Democratic vote. He did not run for reelection, and died in 1896.|$|E
