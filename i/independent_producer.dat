5|$|After {{a week of}} shooting, {{the film}} was shelved due {{to the view that}} such a story might not succeed in Telugu; the {{production}} company instead produced Shanti, which became a failure.

5|$|He {{began his}} career in the chorus line on Broadway for {{director}} George Abbott, where he befriended Kelly. In 1943 he went to Hollywood and worked as a choreographer before he and Kelly made On the Town in 1949. He then worked as a contract director for MGM under producer Arthur Freed producing hit films amid critical acclaim, both as a solo director and with Kelly. In 1952 Donen and Kelly co-directed the musical Singin' in the Rain, {{regarded as one of the}} greatest films ever made. Donen's relationship with Kelly deteriorated in 1955 during their final collaboration on It's Always Fair Weather. He then broke his contract with MGM to become an <b>independent</b> <b>producer</b> in 1957. As musicals began to lose public appeal, Donen switched to comedies. He continued to make hit films until the late 1960s, after which his career slowed down. He briefly returned to the stage as a director in the 1990s and again in 2002.|$|E
5|$|When Davies {{presented}} his {{ideas for the}} U.S. Millionaire to ABC, the network's executives initially rejected them, so he resigned his position there and became an <b>independent</b> <b>producer.</b> Determined to bring his idea for the show to fruition, Davies decided that he was betting his whole career on Millionaires production, and the first move that he made was planning to attach a celebrity host to the show. Along with Philbin, {{a number of other}} popular television personalities were considered for hosting positions on the U.S. Millionaire during its development, including Peter Jennings, Bob Costas, Phil Donahue, and Montel Williams, but among those considered, it was Philbin who wanted the job the most, and when he saw an episode of the British Millionaire and was blown away by his content, Davies and his team ultimately settled on having him host the American show. When Davies approached ABC again after having hired Philbin, the network finally agreed to accept the U.S. Millionaire. With production now ready to begin, the team had only five months to finish developing the show and get it launched, with Davies demanding perfection in every element of Millionaires production.|$|E
40|$|The general {{objective}} is to assist <b>independent</b> <b>producers</b> in Texas in applying tertiary recovery technology to their oil fields. The more specific objectives are: (1) identify production problems, and present technology to overcome such problems, (2) train <b>independent</b> <b>producers</b> how to select suitable EOR techniques and implement them, (3) conduct seminars and workshops on various EOR techniques and their applications, (4) train <b>independent</b> <b>producers</b> how to use available software {{in the fields of}} EOR operations, financing, and workover jobs, (5) establish a technology transfer center to lend primarily the <b>independent</b> <b>producers</b> in Texas the needed assistance to understand and use {{the state of the art}} technology data base in their operations. The kick-start of the project has focused on the following approaches (1) recruiting voluntary members to serve on an advisory committee for the project, (2) reaching out to possible organizations for data base information about <b>independent</b> <b>producers</b> of Texas, (3) reaching <b>independent</b> <b>producers</b> by different ways of communications, (4) conduct technical meeting with consultants, universities, and professional, (5) select topics of immediate concerns related <b>independent</b> <b>producers</b> operational problems, (6) establish a library or software resources for future use in workshops, (7) setting, future schedule for seminars and workshop to assist <b>independent</b> <b>producers</b> in understanding more about their field operations...|$|R
50|$|Lastly, Jenkins characterizes {{content as}} independent. He states that while mass {{producers}} like corporations {{may have an}} advantage over <b>independent</b> <b>producers</b> in regards to visibility, such as indie film makers, <b>independent</b> <b>producers</b> still have opportunities to get their content exposed to the public. For example, he utilizes kick starters {{as an example of}} a funding source for <b>independent</b> <b>producers</b> and the creation of their content. <b>Independent</b> <b>producers</b> have the power to appeal to audiences that the heads of corporations or commercial structures are also trying to attract. As a result, in comparison to Bruns' concept of fluid heterarchy, which states that there is a fluid level of leadership in a produser group, <b>independent</b> <b>producers</b> showcase a fluid level of leadership against large corporations because they still have resources and networks to get their content across to their desired audiences.|$|R

5|$|By 1940, {{the average}} {{production}} {{cost of an}} American feature was $400,000, a negligible increase over ten years. A number of small Hollywood companies had folded {{around the turn of}} the decade, including the ambitious Grand National, but a new firm, Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC), emerged as third in the Poverty Row hierarchy behind Republic and Monogram. The double feature, never universal, was still the prevailing exhibition model: in 1941, 50 percent of theaters were double-billing exclusively, and others employed the policy part-time. In the early 1940s, legal pressure forced the studios to replace seasonal block booking with packages generally limited to five pictures. Restrictions were also placed on the majors' ability to enforce blind bidding. These were crucial factors in the progressive shift by most of the Big Five over to A-film production, making the smaller studios even more important as B movie suppliers. Genre pictures made at very low cost remained the backbone of Poverty Row, with even Republic's and Monogram's budgets rarely climbing over $200,000. Many smaller Poverty Row firms folded as the eight majors, with their proprietary distribution exchanges, now commanded about 95 percent of U.S. and Canadian box office receipts. In 1946, <b>independent</b> <b>producer</b> David O. Selznick brought his bloated-budget spectacle Duel in the Sun to market with heavy nationwide promotion and wide release. The distribution strategy was a major success, despite what was widely perceived as the movie's poor quality. The Duel release anticipated practices that fueled the B movie industry in the late 1950s; when the top Hollywood studios made them standard two decades after that, the B movie would be hard hit.|$|E

25|$|Selznick lent Hitchcock to {{the larger}} studios more often than {{producing}} Hitchcock's films himself. Selznick made only a few films each year, as did fellow <b>independent</b> <b>producer</b> Samuel Goldwyn, so he did not always have projects for Hitchcock to direct. Goldwyn had also negotiated with Hitchcock on a possible contract, only to be outbid by Selznick. Hitchcock was quickly impressed with the superior resources of the American studios compared with the financial limits that he had often faced in Britain.|$|E

25|$|Once, {{after signing}} a {{long-term}} deal with Warner Bros., Bogart had predicted with glee that {{his teeth and}} hair would fall out before the contract ended.

25|$|Perhaps {{in one of}} history's ironies, another {{resident}} of Venango County {{about the same time}} as Henry and Abbie Rogers was a little girl named Ida M.

Introduced to each other in 1902 by their mutual friend Mark Twain, Tarbell who had become an investigative journalist and Rogers, who knew of her work, shared meetings and information over a two-year period which led to her epoch work, The History of the Standard Oil Company, published in 1904, which many historians feel helped fuel public sentiment against the giant company and helped lead to the court-ordered break-up of it in 1911.|$|E

25|$|Loos and Emerson {{turned down}} another picture with Davies, preferring {{to write for}} their old friend Constance Talmadge, whose {{brother-in-law}} Joseph Schenck (husband of Norma Talmadge) was an <b>independent</b> <b>producer.</b> Both A Temperamental Wife (1919) and A Virtuous Vamp (1919) were great hits for Talmadge. The Schenck studios filmed in a New York warehouse, and Loos and Emerson occupied suites at the Algonquin. Individually Anita liked {{many members of the}} Algonquin Round Table, but as a group she found them overwhelming. In the spring of 1919, the couple joined the Talmadges and the Schencks at the Ambassador Hotel on Park Avenue, with Constance, filling the void left by the loss of her sister many years before. When Anita and Constance weren't working, they went shopping. The Talmadge-Schencks convinced Anita to summer with them in Paris without Emerson.
