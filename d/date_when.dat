5|$|On November 4, 2014, Newsom was re-elected as {{lieutenant}} governor of California, defeating Republican Ron Nehring with 57.2% of the vote.

The deadline for applications is five days after the <b>date</b> <b>when</b> the writ of election is issued.|$|E

5|$|John Adams {{predicted}} {{in a famous}} letter, written to his wife on the following day, that July 2 would become a great American holiday.

5|$|The {{origins and}} <b>date</b> <b>when</b> the caves were {{constructed}} have attracted considerable speculations and scholarly attention since the 19th century. These date them between 5th and 9th century, and attribute them to various Hindu dynasties. They are more commonly placed between 5th and 7th centuries.

5|$|A further {{example of}} an {{executive}} decision invalidated by improper purpose {{can be seen from}} Congreve v. Home Office (1976). In that case, the Home Secretary, who had the power to revoke television licences, purported to revoke the licences of people who had pre-empted a rise in licence fees by buying a licence at the old rate before the <b>date</b> <b>when</b> the fees were due to go up, even though their old licences had not yet expired. The court held that this was an improper exercise of the Home Secretary's discretionary powers. His power to revoke could not be used to raise revenue, and therefore this power had been used for the wrong purpose.|$|E
5|$|Blandy ordered Warren {{to explain}} his {{position}} to 1,400 skeptical officers and sailors. Some found him persuasive, but it was August 9 before he convinced Blandy. That was the <b>date</b> <b>when</b> Blandy realized, for the first time, that Geiger counters could not detect plutonium. Blandy {{was aware of the}} health problems of radium dial painters who ingested microscopic amounts of radium in the 1920s, and the fact that plutonium was assumed to have a similar biological effect. When plutonium was discovered in the captain's quarters of Prinz Eugen, unaccompanied by fission products, Blandy realized that plutonium could be anywhere.|$|E
5|$|In real life, Ziegeld {{did not die}} in {{his room}} at the Hotel Warwick (not mentioned) which {{stood in front of}} the Ziegfeld Theatre; he {{actually}} died in Los Angeles and had not even spent his last years in New York. However, McGuire did capture a number of Ziegfeld's traits, such as sending telegrams to people even in close proximity, his belief that elephants were a symbol of good luck, his exquisite taste in costumes and design, and perfectionism over his productions, especially lighting and rostrum pedestaling. McGuire's script, now in the Henry E. Huntington Library, San Marino, California, is dated September 21, 1935, probably the <b>date</b> <b>when</b> it was finalized.|$|E

5|$|It {{was moved}} to its current {{location}} on St George's Street {{at the edge of}} the village, although the <b>date</b> <b>when</b> this was done is unclear. The site where the cross now stands was levelled in 1776 by workmen, paid by Henry Fownes Luttrell, and it may have been on this occasion that the cross was moved. An alternative local tradition is that it was moved in 1825, although a drawing by J. M. W. Turner made in 1811 suggests it was in its present position by then.|$|E
5|$|Orange Bowl {{organizers}} {{predicted that}} Virginia Tech fans, who were located {{closer to the}} site of the game, would be attracted by its proximity and the warm weather offered by southern Florida. Delta Air Lines added more flights from Virginia to Florida in anticipation. To entice more fans to attend, tourism officials planned to step up their advertising in order to boost the economic impact of the event, estimated in 2009 at $200million. The advertising campaign was a difficult sell because the game was scheduled for the first Monday after New Year's Day, the <b>date</b> <b>when</b> most American workers return to their jobs after the New Year.|$|E
5|$|The Declaration became {{official}} when Congress {{voted for}} it on July 4; signatures of the delegates were not needed to make it official. The handwritten copy of the Declaration of Independence that was signed by Congress is dated July 4, 1776. The signatures of fifty-six delegates are affixed; however, the exact <b>date</b> <b>when</b> each person signed {{it has long been}} the subject of debate. Jefferson, Franklin, and Adams all wrote that the Declaration had been signed by Congress on July 4. But in 1796, signer Thomas McKean disputed that the Declaration had been signed on July 4, pointing out that some signers were not then present, including several who were not even elected to Congress until after that date.|$|E

5|$|The Romanian {{military}} {{is undergoing a}} three-stage restructuring. As of 2007, the first short-term stage was completed (reorganisation of the command system, implementation of the voluntary military service). The year 2015 {{marks the end of}} the second stage (operational integration in NATO and EU), while 2025 is the <b>date</b> <b>when</b> the long-term stage is to be completed (full technical integration in NATO and EU). The stages aim at modernising the structure of the armed forces, reducing the personnel as well as acquiring newer and improved technology that is compatible with NATO standards.|$|E
5|$|The Special Police Airborne Unit, {{using three}} helicopters, was {{deployed}} on 17 August 1990 to quell a Croatian Serb insurrection {{in and around}} Knin. Established in 1968, {{it was the only}} combat capable unit of the Croatian military at that time. En route, two Yugoslav Air Force fighters intercepted the helicopters and forced them to land in Ogulin. The day is now considered to be the <b>date</b> <b>when</b> the first unit of the Croatian special police was founded. Following the incident, additional special police units were set up, the bulk of which were formed between September 1990 and September 1991.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{the circle}} around the prince, however, Gaveston also became {{entangled}} in conflicts between the King and his son. These difficulties first materialised in a dispute between treasurer Walter Langton and Prince Edward. The case enraged King Edward {{to the point where}} he banned his son from court, and banished several men from the prince's household. Though the two were reconciled at a later point, the King still prevented Gaveston from rejoining the prince. This matter was settled before 26 May 1306, however, the <b>date</b> <b>when</b> Gaveston was knighted, four days after the prince. Later that year Gaveston was once more in trouble, when he and twenty-one other knights deserted a Scottish campaign to attend a tournament. An arrest order was sent out for the deserters, but, at the insistence of Queen Margaret, they were all pardoned in January 1307.|$|E
