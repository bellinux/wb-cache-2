500|$|Using {{the data}} thus gained, {{combined}} with Enigma operators' tendency to choose predictable letter combinations as indicators (such as girlfriends' initials or {{a pattern of}} keys that they saw on the Enigma keyboard known to the allies as [...] "Cillies" [...] ("Sillies" [...] misspelled)>), Rejewski was able to deduce six permutations corresponding to the <b>encipherment</b> at six consecutive positions of the Enigma machine. These permutations could be described by six equations with various unknowns, representing the wiring within the entry drum, rotors, reflector, and plugboard.|$|E
500|$|The Enigma {{machine was}} an {{electromechanical}} device, {{equipped with a}} 26-letter keyboard and 26 lamps, corresponding to {{the letters of the}} alphabet. Inside was a set of wired drums (rotors and a reflector) that scrambled the input. The machine used a plugboard to swap pairs of letters, and the <b>encipherment</b> varied from one key press to the next. For two operators to communicate, both Enigma machines had to be set up in the same way. The large number of possibilities for setting the rotors and the plugboard combined to form an astronomical number of configurations, and the settings were changed daily, so the machine code had to be [...] "broken" [...] anew each day.|$|E
2500|$|For {{two months}} early in 1943, Shannon {{came into contact}} with the leading British {{mathematician}} Alan Turing. Turing had been posted to Washington to share with the U.S. Navy's cryptanalytic service the methods used by the British Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park to break the ciphers used by the Kriegsmarine U-boats in the north Atlantic Ocean. He was also interested in the <b>encipherment</b> of speech and to this end spent time at Bell Labs. Shannon and Turing met at teatime in the cafeteria. Turing showed Shannon his 1936 paper that defined what is now known as the [...] "Universal Turing machine"; This impressed Shannon, as many of its ideas complemented his own.|$|E
50|$|David Kahn {{notes in}} The Codebreakers that modern {{cryptology}} originated among the Arabs, {{the first people}} to systematically document cryptanalytic methods. The invention of the frequency-analysis technique for breaking monoalphabetic substitution ciphers, by Al-Kindi, an Arab mathematician, sometime around AD 800 proved to be the single most significant cryptanalytic advance until World War II. Al-Kindi wrote a book on cryptography entitled Risalah fi Istikhraj al-Mu'amma (Manuscript for the Deciphering Cryptographic Messages), in which he described the first cryptanalytic techniques, including some for polyalphabetic ciphers, cipher classification, Arabic phonetics and syntax, and most importantly, gave the first descriptions on frequency analysis. He also covered methods of <b>encipherments,</b> cryptanalysis of certain <b>encipherments,</b> and statistical analysis of letters and letter combinations in Arabic.|$|R
50|$|From {{the initial}} {{assignment}} by Western music theorists of letter names to {{notes in the}} 9th century it became possible to reverse the procedure and assign notes to the letters of names. However, this {{does not seem to}} have become a recognized technique until the Baroque period. From the mid-19th century it has become quite common. Sporadic earlier <b>encipherments</b> used solmization syllables.|$|R
50|$|There {{was very}} little in terms of {{organization}} in Pers Z S, in April 1945, when World War II {{was coming to an}} end. Working conditions meant that all elements of the unit were working in the same general area, since the evacuation of Berlin in November 1943. However, one cardinal organization rule was followed: the rule was that mathematical cryptanalysis involving the initial solution of extremely difficult systems, the solutions of complex <b>encipherments</b> and additives and the application of machine systems and techniques to these problems should be kept separate form linguistic cryptanalysis. This was defined as current solutions of known additive and enciphering systems, code-book reconstruction, translation and publication.|$|R
2500|$|At each key depression, the {{right-hand}} or [...] "fast" [...] rotor advanced one position, which caused the <b>encipherment</b> to change. In addition, {{at a certain}} point, {{the right-hand}} rotor caused the middle rotor to advance; in a similar way, the middle rotor might cause the left-hand (or [...] "slow") rotor to advance. Each rotor caused the [...] "turnover" [...] of the rotor to its left after a full rotation. The Enigma operator could rotate the wheels by hand to change {{the letter of the}} alphabet showing through a window, to set the start position of the rotors for enciphering a message. This three-letter sequence was the [...] "message key". There were 26 × 26 × 26 [...] 17,576 possible positions of the set of three rotors, and hence different message keys. By opening the lid of the machine and releasing a compression bar, the set of three rotors on their spindle could be removed from the machine and their sequence (called the [...] "wheel order" [...] at Bletchley Park) could be altered. Multiplying 17,576 by the six possible wheel orders gives 105,456 different ways that the scrambler could be set up.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Encipherment</b> with a Bigram table called double-letter {{conversion}} table (German:Doppelbuchstabentauschtafel), arranged with vertical pairs, was as follow: ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{encrypted}} doubled key {{was a huge}} cryptographic mistake {{because it}} allowed cryptanalysts to know two <b>encipherments</b> of the same letter, three places apart, {{for each of the}} three letters. The Polish codebreakers exploited this mistake in many ways. Marian Rejewski used the doubled key and some known daily keys obtained by a spy, to determine the wiring of the three rotors and the reflector. In addition, code clerks often did not choose secure random keys, but instead chose weak keys such as [...] "AAA", [...] "ABC", and [...] "SSS". The Poles later used the doubled weak keys to find the unknown daily keys. The grill method was an early exploitation of the doubled key to recover part of the daily settings. The cyclometer and the bomba kryptologiczna were later exploitations of the doubled key.|$|R
50|$|One novelty is an <b>encipherment</b> {{using the}} {{plaintext}} as a key. This form of autokey involves a mixed alphabet {{as a prerequisite}} and is free from Girolamo Cardano’s fatal defects. One form of <b>encipherment</b> is here exposed as follows. Given the plaintext “Ave Maria gratia plena” with Bellaso’s IOVE table, the initials of each word are used as a key. The rest of the text letters are then enciphered with subsequent alphabets.|$|E
5000|$|Key Usage: The valid {{cryptographic}} {{uses of the}} certificate's public key. Common values include {{digital signature}} validation, key <b>encipherment,</b> and certificate signing.|$|E
50|$|The key letters A and Q are {{included}} in the cryptogram. The small letter a resulting from the <b>encipherment</b> of the number 2 is a null and must be discarded in the decipherment.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the troops}} and their command, because of their ignorance of the {{scientific}} status of cryptanalytic methods, regarded <b>encipherment</b> as a drag on modern communications technique; I often had to overcome great difficulties to put through my ideas.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A typical {{distribution}} of letters in English language text. Inadequate <b>encipherment</b> may not sufficiently mask the non-uniform {{nature of the}} distribution. This property was exploited in cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher by weakening part of the key.|$|E
50|$|Enigma {{featured}} the major operational convenience of being symmetrical (or self-inverse). This meant that decipherment {{worked in the}} same way as <b>encipherment,</b> so that when the ciphertext was typed in, the sequence of lamps that lit yielded the plaintext.|$|E
5000|$|Key Exchange: The {{process in}} which the U-boat and Headquarters {{established}} a key and used it for exchange of messages. The <b>encipherment</b> process was picked up from where it left off. It was faster than establishing a new key.|$|E
5000|$|Key Usage, { id-ce 15 }, {{provides}} a bitmap specifying the cryptographic operations {{which may be}} performed using the public key contained in the certificate; for example, it could indicate that the key {{should be used for}} signatures but not for <b>encipherment.</b>|$|E
50|$|Bellaso’s third {{book was}} printed in 1564 and {{dedicated}} to Alessandro Farnese. It recapitulates the preceding ciphers, with many new variations {{with regard to}} their usage.All tables are used with or without countersigns or index letters. The <b>encipherment</b> is performed word-by-word or one letter at a time.|$|E
50|$|Arvid Gerhard Damm (27 May 1869 - 1927) was a Swedish {{engineer}} and inventor. He designed {{a number of}} cipher machines, {{and was one of}} the early inventors of the wired rotor principle for machine <b>encipherment.</b> His company, AB Cryptograph, was a predecessor of Crypto AG.|$|E
5000|$|Though Enigma {{had some}} {{cryptographic}} weaknesses, in practice it was German procedural flaws, operator mistakes, failure to systematically introduce changes in <b>encipherment</b> procedures, and Allied capture of key tables and hardware that, during the war, enabled Allied cryptologists to succeed and [...] "turned the tide" [...] in the Allies' favor.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{different}} transaction methods used in shared ATMs {{with regards to}} the <b>encipherment</b> of PIN, and message authentication among them is theso called [...] "ZONE ENCRYPTION". In this method, a trusted authority is appointed to operate on behalf of a group of banks so they could interchange messages for ATM payment approvals.|$|E
50|$|Bellaso’s active {{involvement}} in the art {{for a long time}} is apparent. According to David Kahn,“in combining the best of his two predecessors - the mixed alphabet of Alberti and the letter-by-letter <b>encipherment</b> of Trithemius - with his own brilliant idea of a literal key, he created the modern concept of polyalphabetic substitution” 1973.|$|E
50|$|Dr Karl Schröter joined Pers Z S in the Spring of 1941. A {{mathematical}} theoretician at the University of Münster, {{he received}} his doctorate under Heinrich Scholz. In 1948 he was professor of mathematics at Humboldt University of Berlin and 1964 {{became a member of}} the German Academy of Science. He worked independently on Japanese additive and <b>encipherment</b> systems.|$|E
50|$|In cryptography, FEAL (the Fast data <b>Encipherment</b> ALgorithm) is a {{block cipher}} {{proposed}} {{as an alternative}} to the Data Encryption Standard (DES), and designed to be much faster in software. The Feistel based algorithm was first published in 1987 by Akihiro Shimizu and Shoji Miyaguchi from NTT. The cipher is susceptible to various forms of cryptanalysis, and has acted as a catalyst in the discovery of differential and linear cryptanalysis.|$|E
50|$|The Alberti cipher by Leon Battista Alberti around 1467 is {{believed}} to be the first polyalphabetic cipher. Alberti used a mixed alphabet to encrypt a message, but whenever he wanted to, he would switch to a different alphabet, indicating that he had done so by including an uppercase letter or a number in the cryptogram. For this <b>encipherment</b> Alberti used a decoder device, his cipher disk, which implemented a polyalphabetic substitution with mixed alphabets.|$|E
50|$|Before World War II, {{there were}} two types of cipher {{machinery}} used by Germany. These were the Enigma and those Hagelin type cryptographic machinery. In the latter, all wheels stepped once with each <b>encipherment</b> with the cycle was extended {{by the use of}} different length wheels. For the Enigma, motion was odometer-type, with the only variation being the starting point of the cycle on each rotors. Fritz Menzers inventions were designed to make such motions unpredictable.|$|E
50|$|Like Enigma, Typex was a rotor machine. Typex came in {{a number}} of variations, but were five-rotor {{machines}} (as opposed to three or four in the Enigma) with a non-rotating reflector. Typically the first two rotors were stationary during <b>encipherment,</b> although they could be set by hand. These additional stationary rotors provided a similar sort of protection to that of the Enigma's plugboard (but without the weakness of being reciprocal), which the Typex lacked in early models.|$|E
5000|$|In cryptography, a cipher (or cypher) is an {{algorithm}} {{for performing}} encryption or decryption - {{a series of}} well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure. An alternative, less common term is <b>encipherment.</b> To encipher or encode is to convert information into cipher or code. In common parlance, [...] "cipher" [...] is synonymous with [...] "code", as they are both a set of steps that encrypt a message; however, the concepts are distinct in cryptography, especially classical cryptography.|$|E
50|$|Several {{software}} implementations exist, {{but not all}} exactly match Enigma behaviour. The {{most commonly}} used software derivative (that is not compliant with any hardware implementation of the Enigma) is at EnigmaCo.de. Many Java applet Enigmas only accept single letter entry, complicating use even if the applet is Enigma compliant. Technically, Enigma@home is the largest scale deployment of a software Enigma, but the decoding software does not implement <b>encipherment</b> making it a derivative (as all original machines could cipher and decipher).|$|E
5000|$|The rotor {{stepping}} {{was also}} made more complex. The slowest two rotors, which originally {{were unlikely to}} step {{during the course of}} an <b>encipherment,</b> were redesigned so that they stepped depending on the output of the previous key output. One rotor, designated that [...] "fast bump" [...] rotor, would step if the fourth and fifth bits of the previous output were both true; and similarly the [...] "slow bump" [...] rotor would do the same for the first, second and third bits.|$|E
50|$|The {{figure shift}} (FIGS) and letter shift (LETRS) {{characters}} determined how {{the receiving end}} interpreted the string of characters up to the next shift character. Because {{of the danger of}} a shift character being corrupted, some operators would type a pair of shift characters when changing from letters to numbers or vice versa. So they would type 55M88 to represent a full stop. Such doubling of characters was very helpful for the statistical cryptanalysis used at Bletchley Park. After <b>encipherment,</b> shift characters had no special meaning.|$|E
50|$|Wilhelm Tranow {{initially}} {{worked as}} a radio technician aboard the battleship Pommern. In 1914, he received a coded message, while on watch, from the cruiser Breslau which he forwarded to fleet command, who reported they could not read it. Tranow, who was interested in codes and cryptology, broke the <b>encipherment</b> on the coded messages and forwarded the broken message back to fleet HQ. Showing a lack of urgency and understanding, Fleet HQ issued Tranow a stern warning to keep away from secret matters, {{instead of trying to}} improve the code.|$|E
5000|$|The Alphabetum Kaldeorum {{was meant}} {{primarily}} for the <b>encipherment</b> of diplomatic correspondence; its alphabet implies that predominantly Latin texts were coded: u and v are equated; w was to be written as double v; j is missing. For frequently arising letters the Alphabetum Kaldeorum provides several different versions, which were used at random so that a decipherment attempt using the classical frequency analysis method should fail. [...] "Nulla", cipher-letters with no plaintext assignment which were to be ignored, were also often added to the enciphered texts to further render frequency-analysis useless.|$|E
5000|$|The table {{consisted}} of a 26x26 square of letter pairs with single letters {{at the end of}} each column and row. This was modified for the grid <b>encipherment.</b> At the top of each 26 columns, the cipher clerk wrote one of the 26 most used grid digraphs in a sequence specified by B-Dienst. The clerk replaced replaced the grid digraph with any one of the 26 digraphs under it. The grid digraph AL might become the cipher KS, or LK or OM, or any of the other 23 digraphs ...|$|E
50|$|Educated at Abbotsholme, Gandy {{took two}} years of the Mathematical Tripos, at King's College, Cambridge, before enlisting for {{military}} service in 1940. During World War II he worked on radio intercept equipment at Hanslope Park, where Alan Turing was working on a speech <b>encipherment</b> project, and he became one of Turing's lifelong friends and associates. In 1946, he completed Part III of the Mathematical Tripos, then began studying for a PhD under Turing's supervision. He completed his thesis, On axiomatic systems in mathematics and theories in Physics, in 1952. He {{was a member of the}} Apostles.|$|E
