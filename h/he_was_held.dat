5|$|After Hunyadi {{defeated}} the Ottomans in Transylvania in March 1442, the Ottoman governor of Bulgaria accused Vlad of treachery, {{according to the}} contemporaneous Ottoman historian, Neşri.

Three months later, however, Li Dunyong dropped his case, reporting that he had been ordered to do so by judicial authorities. Another lawyer was reportedly threatened with the closing of his law firm if he chose to defend Dhondup Wangchen.|$|E
5|$|In March 1979 at Stafford Crown Court {{he pleaded}} not guilty to murder but instead pleaded guilty to {{manslaughter}} on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The plea was accepted by the prosecution, after psychiatrists gave evidence that he had an active paranoid psychosis. His indefinite detention was ordered by the trial judge, Mr Justice Stephen Brown, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>held</b> in Broadmoor Hospital and at Ashworth Hospital, both high security units.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} his Roman Catholic leanings, {{evidenced}} {{by the use of}} pre-Reformation Latin texts for his motets and his 1606 conviction for recusancy, Peerson's position {{at the heart of the}} Anglican establishment confirms the overall esteem in which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>held.</b>|$|E

5|$|After Gandhi {{returned}} from Second Round Table conference, {{he started a}} new satyagraha. He was arrested and imprisoned at the Yerwada Jail, Pune. While he was in prison, the British government enacted a new law that granted untouchables a separate electorate. It {{came to be known}} as the Communal Award. In protest, Gandhi started fast-unto-death, while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>held</b> in prison. The resulting public outcry forced the government, in consultations with Ambedkar, to replace the Communal Award with a compromise Poona Pact.|$|E
5|$|At the gallows, Beauchamp {{assured the}} {{assembled}} clergy {{that he had}} a salvation experience on July 6. Too weak to stand, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>held</b> upright by two men while the noose was tied around his neck. At Beauchamp's request, the Twenty-Second Regiment musicians played Bonaparte's Retreat from Moscow while 5,000 spectators watched his execution. It was the first legal hanging in Kentucky's history. Beauchamp's father requested the bodies of his son and daughter-in-law for burial. The two bodies were placed in an embrace in a single coffin, as they had requested. They were buried in Maple Grove Cemetery in Bloomfield, Kentucky. The couple's tombstone was engraved with a poem written by Anna Beauchamp.|$|E

He was interviewed eight times over the first two days, and with a lawyer present four times on the third. During the first 30 hours of his detention he had nothing to eat, and said in court – as did several other suspects – that the heat in the cells was oppressive, making it difficult to breathe.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{authority}} {{collapsed in}} England where, in the King's absence, Isabella's faction {{took over the}} administration {{with the support of}} the Church. Her forces surrounded Bristol, where Hugh Despenser the Elder had taken shelter; he surrendered and was promptly executed. Edward and Hugh the Younger fled their castle around 2 November, leaving behind jewellery, considerable supplies and at least £13,000 in cash, possibly once again hoping to reach Ireland, but on 16 November they were betrayed and captured by a search party north of Caerphilly. Edward was escorted first to Monmouth Castle, and from there back into England, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>held</b> at Henry of Lancaster's fortress at Kenilworth. The King's final remaining forces, by now besieged in Caerphilly Castle, surrendered after five months in April 1327.|$|E
5|$|Euell {{was taken}} to a {{hospital}} and died about an hour after the shooting. He was never able to formally identify Shay as the shooter. When Shay was arrested in his hotel room that night, police officers said that he appeared to be intoxicated. He refused to make any statements. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>held</b> without bail and charged with second-degree murder. A conviction carried the possibility of life imprisonment. A few days after the shooting, American Association owners began to collect funds to assist in Shay's criminal defense. As the case was about to go to trial, one of the attorneys became ill, so the proceedings were delayed for several weeks. The trial was reset for November 12, 1917.|$|E

5|$|Following Llywelyn's {{death in}} 1240, Gwynedd's power {{declined}} {{and many of}} its eastern lands were taken by Henry III of England in 1247. Llywelyn's grandson, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, took power in 1255 and imprisoned his brother Owain ap Gruffudd before extending his power across Wales. Owain was eventually released in 1277 and there has been much historical debate over which castle <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>held</b> in. Hywel Foel ap Griffri wrote a famous poem describing Owain's long imprisonment in a round tower; historians believe that this refers to the keep at Dolbardarn.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi's arrest lasted two years, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>held</b> in the Aga Khan Palace in Pune. During this period, {{his long}} time {{secretary}} Mahadev Desai {{died of a}} heart attack, his wife Kasturba died after 18 months' imprisonment on 22 February 1944; and Gandhi suffered a severe malaria attack. While in Jail, he agreed to an interview with Stuart Gelder, a British journalist. Gelder then composed and released an interview summary, cabled it to the mainstream press, that announced sudden concessions Gandhi was willing to make, comments that shocked his countrymen, the Congress workers and even Gandhi. The latter two claimed that it distorted what Gandhi actually said on a range of topics and falsely repudiated the Quit India movement.|$|E
5|$|In his post-war memoirs, Kesselring {{claimed he}} envisioned making a {{start on the}} {{rehabilitation}} of Germany {{following the end of}} the war. Instead, he was arrested.
