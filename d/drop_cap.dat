Aspects of these recollections have in turn served as a reminder that there is generally an ongoing need for transformations of male consciousness around gender issues and for men to take up roles as catalysts contributing to constructive social change with regard to improving ways in which women are respected and treated in contemporary southern African society. Ceramic artworks featured in this article are selected from the Litha Ncokazi Graduation Exhibition, Ann Bryant Gallery, East London, 2006. John Steele supervised Litha Ncokazi’s B. Tech studies. They collaborated to produce this article which has been divided into three sections, each of which has been indicated at the beginning by a <b>drop</b> <b>cap.</b> Steele has mainly authored the introductory section, then Ncokazi [who uses the personal pronoun “I”] has provided commentary on his artworks in the main section, then both authors have arrived at a joint conclusion.

40|$|International audienceThis article tackles some {{important}} {{issues relating to}} the analysis of a particular case of complex ancient graphic images, called " lettrines ", " <b>drop</b> <b>caps</b> " or " ornamental letters ". Our contribution focuses on proposing generic solutions for lettrine recognition and classification. Firstly, we propose a bottom-up segmentation method, based on texture, ensuring the separation of the letter from the elements of the background in an ornamental letter. Secondly, a structural representation is proposed for characterizing a lettrine. This structural representation is based on filtering automatically relevant information by extracting representative homogeneous regions from a lettrine to generate a graph-based signature. The proposed signature provides a rich and holistic description of the lettrine style by integrating varying low-level features (e. g. texture). Then, to categorize and classify lettrines with similar style, structure (i. e. ornamental background) and content (i. e. letter), a graph-matching paradigm has been carried out to compare and classify the resulting graph-based signatures. Finally, to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed solutions and provide additional insights into their accuracies, an experimental evaluation has been conducted using a relevant set of lettrine images. In addition, we compare the results achieved with those obtained using the state-of-the-art methods to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions...|$|R
