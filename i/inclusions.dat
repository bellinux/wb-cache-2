5|$|Morpholinos can {{interfere}} with pre-mRNA processing steps either by preventing splice-directing small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) complexes from binding to their targets at the borders of introns on a strand of pre-mRNA, or by blocking the nucleophilic adenine base and preventing it from forming the splice lariat structure, or by interfering with the binding of splice regulatory proteins such as splice silencers and splice enhancers. Preventing the binding of snRNP U1 (at the donor site) or U2/U5 (at the polypyrimidine moiety and acceptor site) can cause modified splicing, commonly excluding exons from the mature mRNA. Targeting some splice targets results in intron <b>inclusions,</b> while activation of cryptic splice sites can lead to partial <b>inclusions</b> or exclusions. Targets of U11/U12 snRNPs can also be blocked.

The answer is elusive. <b>Inclusion</b> Matters: The Foundation for Shared Prosperity poses this {{question}} in the World Bank’s first comprehensive examination of social <b>inclusion.</b> Most people would agree that <b>inclusion</b> matters simply from a moral standpoint. The book explains that <b>inclusion</b> also matters {{because it is the}} foundation for shared prosperity. Social exclusion is simply too costly—socially, politically, and economically. The complex idea of social <b>inclusion</b> finds a place in the new strategy of the World Bank Group. <b>Inclusion</b> Matters discusses <b>inclusion</b> in an uncomplicated way.

That “social <b>inclusion</b> is the process of improving the ability, opportunity, and dignity of people, disadvantaged {{on the basis of their}} identity, to take part in society ” is a powerful statement. Understanding that “the poor ” are not one homogenous mass, but are differentiated on the basis of occupation, ethnicity, place of residence, or race, is central to developing effective and inclusive policies. <b>Inclusion</b> Matters: The Foundation for Shared Prosperity provides a frame of reference to help policy makers understand social <b>inclusion</b> and move toward achieving it...|$|R

5|$|Some {{bacteria}} produce intracellular nutrient storage granules {{for later}} use, such as glycogen, polyphosphate, sulfur or polyhydroxyalkanoates. Certain bacterial species, {{such as the}} photosynthetic Cyanobacteria, produce internal gas vacuoles, vesicles which they use to regulate their buoyancy—allowing them to move up or down into water layers with different light intensities and nutrient levels. The gas vacuoles are freely permeable to gas. Intracellular membranes called chromatophores are also found in membranes of phototrophic bacteria. Used primarily for photosynthesis, they contain bacteriochlorophyll pigments and carotenoids. An early idea was that bacteria might contain membrane folds termed mesosomes, but these were later shown to be artefacts produced by the chemicals used to prepare the cells for electron microscopy. <b>Inclusions</b> {{are considered to be}} nonliving components of the cell that do not possess metabolic activity and are not bounded by membranes. The most common <b>inclusions</b> are glycogen, lipid droplets, crystals, and pigments. Volutin granules are cytoplasmic <b>inclusions</b> of complexed inorganic polyphosphate.

40|$|SUMMARY. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{optimize}} the preparation process of baicalin-β-cyclodextrin in-clusion compound (baicalin-β-CD) by adopting Response Surface Methodology (RSM). On the basis of the single-factor experiment, the conditions of the <b>inclusion</b> process were optimized by adopting RSM with the factors to be investigated (i. e. the proportion of β-CD and baicalin, <b>inclusion</b> time and <b>inclusion</b> tempera-ture); the quadratic regression equation model of the <b>inclusion</b> rate of baicalin-β-CD was constructed via simulation. The analysis of the experimental results showed that the optimal <b>inclusion</b> conditions are: pro-portion of β-CD and baicalin of 2. 51, <b>inclusion</b> time of 1. 57 h, and <b>inclusion</b> temperature of 63. 79 °C.
