25|$|Peak {{claimed that}} <b>he</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> to {{disguise}} it. Alternately, in his February 4, 1971 deposition, {{he claimed to}} have shouted and raised his voice to sound like he was excited. In that deposition, he also claimed that he gave the 911 operator an address on Pratt Street and that the operator asked him his home phone number. In the weeks after the bombing, Peak's brother was said to have identified the voice as Peak's.|$|E
60|$|An anxious {{expression}} {{came into}} the man's eyes. He hesitated. <b>He</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b>|$|E
60|$|Husband {{and wife}} {{regarded}} the abandoned room {{in silence for}} a time, and when Mr. Britling spoke <b>he</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b>|$|E
60|$|Steve is much {{moved by}} the {{generosity}} of this. <b>He</b> <b>lowers</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Ferrars," [...] added <b>he,</b> <b>lowering</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> to {{the tone}} {{becoming}} so important a subject, [...] "knows {{nothing about it}} at present, and I {{believe it will be}} best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may be.-- When the marriage takes place, I fear she must hear of it all." ...|$|R
60|$|The brow of Mr Verloc {{broke into}} slight moisture. <b>He</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> husky <b>voice</b> confidentially before the unmoved Chief Inspector.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b> [...] "Notice this chap, just {{in front}} of us, all covered with hair. Paleolithic, you know. And there again--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Sure, that'll be all right. Here are the tickets. Yours is thirty-six, hers is ten.' <b>He</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b> 'Don't go mixing them.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was my {{turn now}} to stare with {{surprise}} and curiosity. He hadn't been talking loud but <b>he</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> still more.|$|E
6000|$|... 'On {{one which}} never failed {{a person of}} my house. I have seen,' <b>he</b> said, <b>lowering</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> 'I have seen the Bodach Glas.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Penelope," [...] <b>he</b> declared, <b>lowering</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> a little, [...] "it isn't fair. You {{never have}} a word {{to say to me}} when the Prince is here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'As Englishman to Englishwoman,' {{repeated}} Louis, {{in her own}} formula. 'Or rather,' <b>he</b> added, <b>lowering</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> 'trust me, for {{the sake}} of those who gave the clasp.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{all over}} the village about old Mrs. Inglethorp dying so suddenly. They do say--" [...] <b>he</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> cautiously--"that it's poison?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't say a word:' <b>he</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b> 'Riding {{is against}} orders, but I cannot miss the Yeomanry, {{under the present}} aspect of affairs.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> from a {{shout to}} its normal tone as Emma Wheeler in {{self-defence}} {{opened the door}} and drove the small fry out.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do kindly tell me," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>lowering</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> [...] "what's {{the type}} to which that young lady belongs? Mrs. Bonnycastle tells me it's a new one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come and sit down," [...] he said. [...] "I {{want to talk}} to you. I want," [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>lowering</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> [...] "to {{thank you}} for your warning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So, so," [...] {{said the}} other. [...] "But it ain’t the {{rheumatism}} {{so much what}} troubles me," [...] <b>he</b> resumed, <b>lowering</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> and looking round cautiously. [...] "It’s Kate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, {{he might}} have known," [...] added Ben. <b>He</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b> [...] "Say, Phil, if he doesn't give us the supper make him give your money back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{the fellow}} was forever {{sticking}} in here," [...] he burst out, distractedly. [...] "He {{made love to}} you, I suppose--and, and [...] ." [...] <b>He</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b> [...] "And--you let him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very decently indeed. I've complimented their C.O. and buttered {{the whole}} boiling." [...] <b>He</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b> [...] "As a matter o' fact, I halted five good minutes to give 'em {{time to get}} into position." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll ha' borne my {{warning to}} Sir Oliver?" [...] <b>he</b> asked, <b>lowering</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> {{so as not}} to be overheard by the vintner who was {{stirring}} beyond the thin wooden partition.|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{long as you}} {{permit me}} to say two or three things which are in my mind," [...] <b>he</b> answered, <b>lowering</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> a little, [...] "you may do {{all the rest of}} the talking." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly too much, madam, in any common case," [...] said he, quite unmoved. [...] "Certainly too much, if I {{asked you}} for it, as I do not, as the token of an affection which I know well you do not, cannot feel. But--take my words as they stand--were you to--It would be {{returned}} if I die, {{in a few}} weeks; and returned still sooner if I live. And, madam," [...] said <b>he</b> <b>lowering</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> [...] "I vow to you, before Him who sees us both, that, as far as I am concerned, no human being shall ever know of the fact." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The truth," [...] said Arsenio, with a shrug. [...] "Any man who {{wilfully}} abides in {{the services}} of Condillac"--and instinctively <b>he</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> lest the Captain or the Marquise should be within earshot--, [...] "is excommunicate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{these guys}} are going to dig it up. That's the way it looks to me." [...] <b>He</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b> [...] "Say, I saw Clarice last night," [...] he said in a {{confidential}} undertone. [...] "It's all right." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> as he spoke, {{not with}} a view to imparting {{impressive}} mystery to his statement, but because there were other table groups within hearing to whom he hoped presently to have the privilege of re-disclosing his revelation.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's true.' The Colonel is appeased. 'Thank you, Dering, {{for saying}} that.' But next moment <b>he</b> has <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> again. 'Dering, {{there is nothing}} wrong, is there? Is {{anything}} happening that I am not being told about?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have thought}} of that, too. Send him to London to see Danvers and to stir up your friends there. And," [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>lowering</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> [...] "give him {{discretion}} to see Sunderland if he thinks well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only a little--an {{insignificant}} little. He is no agent because----" [...] He hesitated, {{and glanced}} swiftly up. Then <b>he</b> sighed, <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> and with consummately simulated sorrow, he concluded [...] "Because he is, himself, Francesco del Falco. Count of Aquila." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They rud into town" [...] (<b>he</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> for {{the room}} was filling), [...] "snapped their fingers at Tipton and his warrant, and rud out ag'in. My God, but that was like Nollichucky Jack. Say, stranger, when your Mr. Temple smiled--" ...|$|E
60|$|Alvarez looked about. All {{was very}} quiet; {{there was nobody}} in the patio, and it was some {{distance}} to the nearest window in the wall that faced the pillars. For all that, <b>he</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> and answered in hesitating English with an American accent.|$|E
60|$|Dr. Whacker drew still {{closer to}} him as they stepped along the wharf. <b>He</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> to a still more {{confidential}} tone. His hard blue eyes peered up into the swart, sardonic face of his companion, who was a head taller than himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is very unfortunate--very unfortunate indeed. I {{very much}} regret {{that you should}} have been...." [...] <b>He</b> <b>lowered</b> {{suddenly}} <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b> [...] "But what is it--surely you are not departing, Natalia Victorovna? You got bored waiting, didn't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We will utter an edict {{to secure}} your privacy," [...] said the Duke; [...] "and {{you do not}} think," [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>lowering</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> to a {{confidential}} whisper, [...] "that ten thousand {{is too much to}} pay to the Sovereign, in name of wardship?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{mother was}} rather strict about it, {{to tell the}} truth," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>lowering</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> to Mrs. Duke. [...] "She never liked me to lose my cap at school. And when a man's been taught to be tidy and neat it sticks to him." ...|$|R
