The identification of a microbe depends upon the isolation of an individual colony, as biochemical testing of a microbe to determine its different physiological features depends on a pure culture.To make a subculture, one again works in aseptic technique in microbiology, lifting a single colony off the agar surface with a loop and streaks the material into the 4 quadrants of an agar plate or all over if the colony was singular and did not look mixed. Gram staining the raw sample before incubation or staining freshly grown colony material helps {{to determine if a}} colony consists of uniformly appearing bacteria or is mixed, and the color, and shape of bacteria allow a first classification based on morphology. In clinical microbiology numerous other staining techniques for particular organisms are used (acid fast bacterial stain for mycobacteria). <b>Immunological</b> <b>staining</b> techniques, such as direct immunofluorescence have been developed for medically important pathogens that are slow growing (Auramine-rhodamine stain for mycobacteria) or difficult to grow (such as Legionella pneumophila species) and where the test result would alter standard management and empirical therapy.|$|E

40|$|SummaryWe {{present a}} case of chronic {{thrombus}} occlusion visualized by optical coherence tomography (OCT) in a patient following bare metal stent (BMS) implantation. A 74 -year-old Japanese man was treated with single BMS implantation for acute coronary syndrome. The second follow-up angiography demonstrated no restenosis at the BMS site in the convalescent phase before discharge. A third coronary angiography at 6 months after BMS implantation showed sub-total occlusion at a site just proximal to the BMS. OCT was performed to evaluate in-stent restenosis. OCT demonstrated an organized thrombus-like image containing a micro-channel in the target lesion. Repeat percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed with a distal protection device {{and we were able}} to aspirate some tissue from the culprit lesion. Pathological examination of this tissue revealed an organized fibrin thrombus with angiogenesis. Phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin staining and CD 68 <b>immunological</b> <b>staining</b> were positive in this tissue. Moreover, <b>immunological</b> <b>staining</b> for CD 34 was positive in the micro-channel of this tissue, suggesting chronic build up. This case demonstrated that chronic, organized thrombus formation is a possible cause of restenosis after BMS implantation in the convalescent phase, and that OCT is a useful modality to discriminate thrombus formation from regular neo-intimal hyperplasia in in-stent restenosis lesions...|$|E

40|$|Objective. To examine our {{experience}} with cytology and histology biopsy {{of the liver}} and to define methods for improvement of diagnosis of primary liver tumors. Methods. This include retrospective study of 189 biopsies of 185 liver masses for cytological or histological analysis. Patients were subdivided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of 124 suspected metastasis. Group 2 consisted of 61 suspected primary neoplasms. Biopsies were considered positive or equivocal. In equivocal cases, special stains were performed. In Group 2, cases were classified by contrast CT or MRI as to (I) classic HCC, (II) infiltrated HCC, or (Ill) equivocal. Results. Definitive diagnosis was obtained in 117 / 124 masses (94 %) in Group 1, 48 / 61 masses (79 %) in Group 2, and (Ill) equivocal 13 cases in Group II. In two equivocal cases in which special stains were performed, they were reclassified as HCC. In 8 / 13 cases, CT findings were consistent with HCC. Conclusion. Liver biopsies are useful in obtaining a definitive diagnosis of suspected metastatic liver disease. Biopsy results are less reliable in patients with suspected primary liver tumors. In these situations, strategies can include basing treatment on imaging criteria or use of newer special pathological stains. Advances in Knowledge.

40|$|Abstract: Reports {{have shown}} that murine {{embryonic}} stem cells (mESC) can differentiate into primordial germ cells (PGC) and then to early gametes (oocytes and sperm) that after fertilization form blastocysts. Preliminary studies indicated that hESC also {{have the potential to}} differentiate into germ cells. Currently, there are no reports on directed differentiation of hESCs into oocytes. Here, we investigated the effects of human fetal testicular extracts (HFTE) and hormones i. e. follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to coax hESC to differentiate into oocytes. The embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from hESC formed ovarian-like structures (OLS) after treatment with HFTE for 7 days and with hormones (FSH + hCG) for 20 - 30 days. OLS exhibited typical oocyte-like spherical shape of variable sizes and some with zona pellucida-like covering RT-PCR, <b>immunological</b> fluorescence <b>staining</b> and flow cytometry analyses showed that these structures are positive for specific germ cell and oocyte markers such as OCT 4, SCP 3, C-KIT and DDX 4, STELLA, FIGLA, GDF 9, NANOG，FSHR, ZP 1, ZP 2 and ZP 3. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that FSHR, GDF 9 and FIGLA were up-regulated during OLS differentiation from EB in a time-dependent manner. These results demonstrated that hESC have the ability to differentiate into ovarian structures. This study thus provides an in vitro model to study germ-cell formation from hESC and these germ cells may generate a potential source of oocytes for therapeutic cloning...|$|R

TUSC 3 (tumor suppressor candidate 3) was identified as a potential tumor suppressor gene and previous study showed TUSC 3 is decreased in pancreatic cancer at mRNA level, but its putative tumor suppressor function remains to be verified. In this study, TUSC 3 expression was found to be suppressed both at mRNA and protein levels in cell line models as well as in clinical samples; decreased TUSC 3 expression was associated with higher pathological TNM staging and poorer outcome. In three pairs of cell lines with different NF-κB activity, TUSC 3 expression was found to be reversely correlated with NF-κB activity. TUSC 3 -silenced pancreatic cancer cell line exhibited enhanced potential of proliferation, migration and invasion. In an orthotopic implanted mice model, TUSC 3 silenced cells exhibited more aggressive phenotype with more liver metastasis. In conclusion, the current study shows that decreased <b>immunological</b> TUSC 3 <b>staining</b> is a factor prognostic of poor survival in pancreatic cancer patients and decreased TUSC 3 promotes pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis.

A variety of diagnostic tests including microscopic (Kinyoun 2 ̆ 7 s <b>staining),</b> <b>immunological</b> (Direct Fluorescence Antibody tests or DFAT), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and molecular methods (nested PCR) were compared to assess their ability to detect Cryptosporidium in cattle, horse and sheep faecal samples.

Finally different PCR primer sets targetedat the same region resulted in the preferential amplification of certain Cryptosporidium species when multiple species were present in the sample. Therefore, for identification of Cryptosporidium spp. in the event of asymptomatic cryptosporidiosis, the combination of different 18 S rRNA nested PCR primer sets is recommended for further epidemiological applications and also tracking the sources of infection...|$|R

It usually causes pulsatile tinnitus, recurrent ear bleeds, deafness or facial palsy and is rarely associated with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). The latter may lead to false histopathological findings. We present an unusual case of a 45 -year-old female with a right ear glomus tumour that was associated with CSOM and a large polyp protruding from the auditory canal. Despite preoperative investigations including computed tomography, diagnosis of the tumour could not be established. After taking a biopsy, a curative operation had to be abandoned because of a torrential intra-operative haemorrhage.

The antibody does not precipitate 16 a-iodooestradiol-labelled ER from MCF- 7 cells. Expression-linked screening of the MCF- 7 cDNA library with antibody 15 F 6 identified nine positive clones. Antibody staining could be blocked by pre-incubating the antibody with hER aa 497 - 507 -BSA conjugate, but not with an unrelated hER peptide conjugate. The (260 bp) clones were found to be identical. Submission of sequence to BLAST protein and nucleotide databases revealed a lack of homology to known proteins and genes. Sequence was matched to expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from brain, liver/spleen, uterus, ovary, colon, heart, and placenta. To further define the epitope of antibody 15 F 6, the sequence was translated and three peptides containing potential epitopes, comparable to the hER aa 497 - 507 region, were synthesised and tested by ELISA. The putative epitope was shown to be contained within one of these peptides...|$|E
40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONLeiomyosarcoma of {{the small}} bowel is an {{extremely}} rare form of gastrointestinal malignancy. Small bowel tumours are usually asymptomatic at the early stages, and difficult to visualise by upper and lower endoscopy. PRESENTATION OF CASEAn 83 -year-old gentleman presented in surgical outpatient clinic with chronic anaemia, abdominal discomfort and a single episode of malaena. Initial OGD and colonoscopy were both unremarkable. Subsequent CT revealed a mass in the right iliac fossa of likely small bowel origin, leading to an urgent laparotomy and resection with primary anastomosis. Histopathology showed a high grade leiomyosarcoma with no signs of metastasis and confirmatory <b>immunological</b> <b>staining.</b> Post-surgery follow up remains unremarkable. DISCUSSIONLeiomyosarcomas {{of the small}} bowel are extremely rare entities, particularly following the advent of robust immunohistological diagnostic methods allowing differentiation from GISTs. As small bowel tumours are often not visualised by upper and lower endoscopy, further investigations to visualise the small bowel are crucial, generally {{in the form of}} magnetic resonance enterography, CT colonography or wireless capsule endoscopy. CONCLUSIONThe treatment of such tumours remains predominantly centred around surgical resection, and prognosis is dependent on tumour size and histological staging...|$|E
40|$|Acquisition of truncating {{mutations}} in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein underlies {{the progression of}} the majority of sporadic and familial colorectal cancers. As such, the localisation patterns and interacting partners of APC have been extensively studied in a range of systems, relying on the use of a broad panel of antibodies. Until recently, antibodies to APC have been used largely unchecked. However, several recent reports have been invaluable in clarifying the use of a number of antibodies commonly used to detect APC. Here, we analyse the specificity of a further subset of antibodies to APC. We used a panel of six commercially available antibodies (directed to the amino and carboxy termini of APC) and confirm the detection of full-length APC by immunoblotting. We demonstrate that a 150 kDa protein, also reproducibly detected by this panel of antibodies, is unlikely to be APC. We present data for the <b>immunological</b> <b>staining</b> patterns of the APC antibodies and validate the results through RNAi. Using this approach, we confirm that the apical staining pattern, observed by immunofluorescence and previously reported in cell systems, is unlikely to be APC. Finally, we present our data as a summary of APC-antibody specificities for APC...|$|E
40|$|Thyrotropin or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) {{secretion}} in {{the chicken}} is controlled by several hypothalamic hormones. It is stimulated by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), whereas somatostatin (SRIH) exerts an inhibitory effect. In {{order to determine the}} mechanism by which these hypothalamic hormones modulate chicken TSH release, we examined the cellular localization of TRH receptors (TRH-R), CRH receptors type I (CRH-R 1) and somatostatin subtype 2 receptors (SSTR 2) in the chicken pars distalis by in situ hybridization (ISH), combined with <b>immunological</b> <b>staining</b> of thyrotropes. We show that thyrotropes express TRH-Rs and SSTR 2 s, allowing a direct action of TRH and SRIH {{at the level of the}} thyrotropes. CRH-R 1 expression is virtually confined to corticotropes, suggesting that CRH-induced adrenocorticotropin release is the result of a direct stimulation of corticotropes, whereas CRH-stimulated TSH release is not directly mediated by the known chicken CRH-R 1. Possibly CRH-induced TSH secretion is mediated by a yet unknown type of CRH-R in the chicken. Alternatively, a pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) -derived peptide, secreted by the corticotropes following CRH stimulation, could act as an activator of TSH secretion in a paracrine way.

40|$|SummaryBackground and objectivesThe {{diagnosis}} of granulomatous inflammation with possible tuberculosis (TB) infection in histopathology is often difficult. There {{is a need}} for a rapid and reliable diagnostic test. Thus, we evaluated the performance of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis direct (MTD) test in specimens with granulomatous lymphadenitis and negative acid fast stains. MethodsThe M. tuberculosis direct (MTD) test by Gen-Probe was performed on 45 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples including 34 lymph nodes. We measured the predictive values of the MTD test in specimens with granulomatous lymphadenitis and negative acid fast stains. ResultsThe overall test sensitivity was 73. 9 %, and specificity was 95. 4 %. The MTD test sensitivity and specificity for lymph node tissue were 72. 7 % and 91. 67 %, respectively. In the presence of granulomatous inflammation, the MTD test sensitivity and specificity were higher than those for all tissue samples, at 75 % and 100 %, respectively. ConclusionBased on this study, the MTD test should be used as a supportive test in addition to conventional histochemical or <b>immunological</b> <b>staining</b> methods when evaluating lymph node tissue with a granulomatous inflammation to deliver stronger evidence to support clinical decisions at a much earlier time than a culture would allow...|$|E
40|$|The {{envelope}} glycoprotein (Env) of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type I (HIV- 1) mediates membrane fusion. To analyze the mechanism of HIV- 1 Env-mediated membrane fusion, it is desirable to determine the expression level of Env on the cell surface. However, the quantification of Env by <b>immunological</b> <b>staining</b> is often hampered by the diversity of HIV- 1 Env and limited availability of universal antibodies that recognize different Envs with equal efficiency. To overcome this problem, here we linked a tag protein called HaloTag at the C-terminus of HIV- 1 Env. To relocate HaloTag to the cell surface, we introduced a second membrane-spanning domain (MSD) between Env and HaloTag. The MSD of transmembrane protease serine 11 D, a type II transmembrane protein, successfully relocated HaloTag to the cell surface. The surface level of Env can be estimated indirectly by staining HaloTag with a specific membrane-impermeable fluorescent ligand. This tagging did not compromise the fusogenicity of Env drastically. Furthermore, fusogenicity of Env was preserved even after the labeling with the ligands. We have also found that an additional foreign peptide or protein such as C 34 or neutralizing single-chain variable fragment (scFv) {{can be linked to}} the C-terminus of the HaloTag protein. Using these constructs, we were able t...|$|E
