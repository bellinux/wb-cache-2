Also, the team added several different appliances to Kris Iyer to show his character go {{through a series of}} levels of infection of a number of diseases at the hands of Soong. These included colored contact lenses, prosthetics to make <b>his</b> <b>veins</b> appear to pulse and gel was added to his eyes to make them bloodshot.|$|E

25|$|This {{legal system}} of racial {{classification}} based on patrilineal descent had no parallel {{anywhere in the}} Spanish-ruled colonies in the Americas. In general, a son born of a sangley male and an indio or mestizo de sangley female was classified as mestizo de sangley; all subsequent male descendants were mestizos de sangley {{regardless of whether they}} married an India or a mestiza de sangley. A daughter born in such a manner, however, acquired the legal classification of her husband, i.e., she became an India if she married an indio but remained a mestiza de sangley if she married a mestizo de sangley or a sangley. In this way, a chino mestizo male descendant of a paternal sangley ancestor never lost his legal status as a mestizo de sangley no matter how little percentage of Chinese blood he had in <b>his</b> <b>veins</b> or how many generations had passed since his first Chinese ancestor; he was thus a mestizo de sangley in perpetuity.|$|E
25|$|In 1894, Boyce {{was elected}} to the Idaho state senate as a Populist from Shoshone County, Idaho. Boyce battled for the eight-hour day for miners, the {{establishment}} of an arbitration board to settle labor disputes, and an investigation of the 1892 mining war. He objected to appropriations for the state militia, charging that it was a tool used by the state and mine owners to suppress labor. He called for legislation to forbid employment of aliens, to outlaw yellow-dog contracts and prohibit company stores. In {{one of the most dramatic}} speeches he ever made, Boyce denounced the blacklist:Senate bill fifty six provides for no class, no special legislation, but under its provisions those relentless persecutors, known as corporations, are prevented when they discharge an employee from following him with a blacklist and depriving him of the means of earning an honest living in another part of the state….Why do you not produce some argument against it to show that it should not become a law? No, it is not necessary: you of the Republican party have the votes to kill the bill and that is all you desire. But remember these words: the laboring men of Idaho have asked you for bread and you give them a stone: we ask you for justice and you treat us with scorn, but the day is fast approaching when your action will be condemned by every man who has one drop of manly blood in <b>his</b> <b>veins.</b>|$|E

500|$|Welensky {{was born}} in Pioneer Street, Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia. His father, Michael Welensky (b. c. 1843), was of Lithuanian Jewish origin, hailing from a village near Wilno (today Vilnius); a trader in Russia and horse-smuggler during the Franco-Prussian War, he settled in Southern Rhodesia after first emigrating to the United States, {{where he was a}} saloon-keeper, and then South Africa. His mother, Leah (born Aletta Ferreira; c. 1865–1918), was a ninth-generation Afrikaner of Dutch ancestry. His parents, for whom Raphael or [...] "Roy" [...] was the 13th child, kept a [...] "poor white" [...] {{boarding}} house. Welensky's mother died when he was 11, being treated by Godfrey Huggins, a doctor who was later to become the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia. Although not of British ancestry, Welensky was intensely pro-British, a distinctive sentiment among Rhodesians. John Connell, in his foreword to Welensky's book 4000 Days, wrote: [...] "Welensky, who had not a drop of British blood in <b>his</b> <b>veins,</b> shared this pride and loyalty [...] to the full." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{retired in}} 2006. He spent nearly 45years in the Army but called it [...] "a regret" [...] {{that he never}} fought in a {{conventional}} battle—having been in a staff position in 1982 during the Falklands War and serving as a brigade commander in Northern Ireland during the Gulf War. He said that [...] "Fighting is what {{a young man with}} good red blood in <b>his</b> <b>veins</b> joins for. It is the ultimate test for the professional soldier". He has continued to voice opinions on military matters in his retirement. He delivered the annual Richard Dimbleby Lecture four months after leaving the Army. In the lecture, titled The Defence of The Realm in the 21st Century, he criticised the Ministry of Defence and questioned the MoD's understanding of the fundamental ethos of the armed forces. He was critical of the treatment of soldiers, calling some soldiers' accommodation [...] "frankly shaming" [...] and saying that the [...] "Armed Forces' contract with the nation... must be a two-way one", going on to say that [...] "military operations cost in blood and treasure, because risk-free soldiering, which some seem to think is possible, is simply a contradiction in terms". The MoD responded by saying that [...] "while we do not agree with everything Sir Mike has said, we are always the first to recognise—for example in relation to medical services and accommodation—that although we have delivered real improvements, there is more we can do".|$|E

500|$|It {{was decided}} {{the effects of}} kryptonite {{poisoning}} on Clark, [...] "Clark time", {{and the appearance of}} kryptonite when in the proximity of Clark would need to be illustrated in a way the audience could understand if they were not familiar with the character. Gough and Millar, after doing some research, learned the female audience was not aware of what was happening when Clark was exposed to kryptonite. Beginning with [...] "Metamorphosis", whenever Clark was exposed to kryptonite, <b>his</b> <b>veins</b> would rise up and develop a green hue to illustrate the effect it was having. Close-up shots of Clark's hand were used for these scenes, and it was all created with digital animation. Gough and Millar developed the idea that kryptonite would only glow when it was around Clark, as it was meant to demonstrate the draining of his powers. [...] "Clark time", the same idea behind bullet time, was created because previous incarnations had not explained the idea of what the world appears like to Clark when he is using his powers. The first instance of [...] "Clark time" [...] was used in the [...] "Metamorphosis" [...] scene where Greg Arkin attacks Clark and Jonathan in their barn. Jonathan is pushed over a banister and falls in the direction of some dangerous farm equipment. The effect involved slowing time down for everything except Clark, who would be moving at normal pace. When tackling Clark's emerging power of X-ray vision, Gough and Millar {{wanted to be able to}} see skeletons and bones, as opposed to previous incarnations that treated the ability like [...] "see-through" [...] vision. The recent advances in computer imagery helped them complete that task.|$|E

Although Burroughs would have episodes of being free from heroin, from this point until his death he was regularly addicted to the drug. He died in 1997 on a methadone maintenance program. In an introduction to , James Grauerholz (who managed Burroughs's reading tours in the 1980s and 1990s) mentions {{that part of his}} job was to deal with the [...] "underworld" [...] in each city to secure the author's needed drugs.|$|E

This resulted with Dio having the Joestar blood flowing through <b>his</b> <b>veins,</b> linking him to Jonathan's descendants, his manifesting of a Stand causing Joseph and Jotaro to follow suit as consequence. Dio vows to destroy the Joestar family and sends a brain-washed student Noriaki Kakyoin after Jotaro.

2500|$|After {{a second}} foray into motor racing, Ajith signed a film {{directed}} by Venkat Prabhu, titled Mankatha, which notably became his 50th project. The film featured {{him in a}} full-length negative role as Vinayak Mahadevan, a suspended police officer who lusts after money. His performance and his decision to portray a character with negative shades, breaking the stereotype hero image in Tamil cinema, were lauded by critics, with reviewers from Sify and Rediff terming the film as an [...] "out and out Ajith film" [...] that worked [...] "only because of Ajith". Heaping praise on the actor's performance, the former noted that he [...] "rocks as the man with ice in <b>his</b> <b>veins</b> as the mean and diabolic cop" [...] and that he played [...] "the emotionless bad man, to perfection", while the latter wrote that he had [...] "carried practically the whole film on his capable shoulders".

2500|$|Rosenberg {{was born}} on 12 January 1893 in Tallinn in the Russian Empire, the capital of modern Estonia, to a family of Baltic Germans. His father, Waldemar Wilhelm Rosenberg, was a wealthy {{merchant}} from Latvia, and his mother, Elfriede (née Siré), was a teacher of French language in Tallinn. The Hungarian-Jewish journalist Franz Szell, who was apparently residing in Tilsit, Lithuania, spent a year researching in Latvian and Estonian archives before publishing in 1936 an open letter, with copies to Hermann Göring, Joseph Goebbels, German foreign minister Konstantin von Neurath, and others, accusing Rosenberg of having [...] "no drop of German blood" [...] flowing in <b>his</b> <b>veins.</b> Szell wrote that among Rosenberg's ancestors were only [...] "Latvians, Jews, Mongols, and French." [...] As {{a result of his}} open letter, Szell was deported by Lithuanian authorities on September 15, 1936.

He then drove her to St Petersburg, where the guards regiments there proclaimed their loyalty to her. The Tsar was arrested and imprisoned at Ropsha, under the guard of Alexei Orlov. There Peter died in mysterious circumstances on [...] Orlov is popularly supposed to have murdered him, either on his own initiative or on Catherine's orders. One account has Orlov giving him poisoned wine to drink which caused ... flames [...] through <b>his</b> <b>veins.</b> This aroused suspicion in the overthrown emperor and he refused the next glass. But they used force, and he defended himself. In that horrible struggle, in order to stifle his cries, they threw him on the ground and grabbed his throat. But he defended himself with the strength that comes from final desperation, and they tried to avoid wounding him. They placed a rifle strap on the emperor's neck. Alexei Orlov kneeled with both legs on his chest and blocked his breathing. He passed away in their hands. [...] Orlov apparently wrote a letter to Catherine after Peter's death, confessing that Peter had been killed in a drunken brawl with one of his jailers, Feodor Bariatynsky, and taking the blame. The authenticity of this letter has been questioned. It was announced that the Tsar had died from an attack of haemorrhoidal colic.|$|E
