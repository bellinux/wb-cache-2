5|$|Early on 8 July, U-255 caught another {{ship from}} Convoy PQ 17, the 6,069 ton American {{merchant}} ship Olopana, loaded with 6,000 tons of explosives, gasoline, and trucks as deck cargo. A single torpedo hit the ship, blowing {{out all the}} bulkheads, and killing seven of the crew. The surviving crewmen abandoned ship on four rafts, as U-255 surfaced and fired 20 shells at the ship, which sank after 20 minutes. U-255 questioned the survivors, gave them a course to land, {{and asked if they}} had <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> and water before leaving. The survivors landed at Moller Bay, Novaya Zemlya, two days later.|$|E
5|$|Henderson and JPL {{director}} Bruce Ng {{prepare a}} space probe to deliver <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> to last Watney until Ares IV's arrival. When the Hab's airlock malfunctions {{due to a}} small puncture, it destroys Watney's crops. Sanders orders the team {{to speed up the}} supply mission with the Iris probe by skipping the safety inspections. However, an oversight causes the destabilization and subsequent explosion of the rocket 40 seconds after liftoff, causing Watney to think about his seemingly inevitable death.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians, doubting that a Persian {{commander}} {{would have}} sabotaged his own invasion, have suggested several other possible scenarios. It is, however, {{impossible to know}} exactly how the Naxians {{became aware of the}} invasion, but undoubtedly they were aware, and began to make preparations. Herodotus tells us that the Naxians had previously had no inkling of the expedition, but that when news arrived they brought everything in from the fields, gathered <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> with which to survive a siege and reinforced their walls.|$|E

5|$|Sitting Bull and {{his people}} stayed in Canada for 4 years. Due to the smaller size of the buffalo herds in Canada, Sitting Bull and his men found it {{difficult}} to find <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> to feed his people, who were starving and exhausted. Sitting Bull’s presence in the country led to increased tensions between the Canadian and the United States governments. Before Sitting Bull left Canada, he may have visited Walsh for a final time and left a ceremonial headdress as a memento.|$|E
5|$|Suffering a {{wound on}} the Borodino {{battlefield}} was effectively a death sentence, as French forces did not possess <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> for the healthy, {{much less the}} sick; consequently, equal numbers of wounded soldiers starved to death, died of their injuries, or perished through neglect. The casualties were for a single day of battle, while the Russian figures are for the 5th and the 7th, combined. Using the same accounting method for both armies brings the actual French Army casualty count to 34,000–35,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{biggest concern}} was food; {{ensuring}} there was <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> occupied {{most of the}} internees' time. Little food {{was provided by the}} Japanese authorities, and it was of poor quality – frequently containing dust, mud, rat and cockroach excreta, cigarette ends, and sometimes dead rats. Everyday, the internees were served rice congee at 8am, and meals consisting of rice with stew at both 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. Additionally, they relied on food mailed from friends or relatives in the city, Red Cross aid, garden-grown vegetables, and bought food from the canteen or the black market.|$|E

5|$|The {{hospital}} {{cared for}} more than 4,500 patients (most of them Jews) from 20 countries, suffering from starvation, alimentary dystrophy, gangrene, necrosis, internal haemorrhaging, and typhoid fever. At least 500 patients died. Assistance was provided by volunteers from Oświęcim and Brzeszcze, who donated money and food, cleaned hospital rooms, delivered water, washed patients, cooked meals, buried the dead, and transported the sick in horse-drawn carts between locations. Securing <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> for thousands of former prisoners was a constant challenge. The hospital director personally went from village to village to collect milk.|$|E
5|$|The {{remoteness}} of Dawson {{proved an}} ongoing {{problem for the}} supply of food, and as the population grew to 5,000 in 1897, this became critical. When the rivers iced over, {{it became clear that}} there would not be <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> for that winter. The NWMP evacuated some prospectors without supplies to Fort Yukon in Alaska from September 30 onwards, while others made {{their way out of the}} Klondike in search of food and shelter for the winter.|$|E
5|$|A {{squadron}} {{commanded by}} Admiral Pierre Vanstabel was dispatched to Hampton Roads to provide escort. Vanstabel {{would bring the}} convoy to the Bay of Biscay, where a second squadron under Joseph-Marie Nielly would reinforce him {{for the rest of}} the journey. Together, these officers mustered six ships of the line and numerous smaller craft. The main French battlefleet of 25 ships under Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse would cruise the Bay of Biscay in order to challenge the British Channel Fleet if it attempted to intercept the supplies. The convoy's passage was expected to take approximately two months, and it included 117 merchant ships carrying <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> to feed France for a year.|$|E

5|$|Banished {{revolves}} around the player guiding citizens of a remote community of outcasts to grow and maintain a settlement through a command economy. The game focuses on the player's town as a whole, with {{the citizens of the}} town acting as a resource to be managed. The player must assign citizens to various jobs such as building or fishing. The citizens then perform the job without specific direction from the player. Citizens have needs that must be met in order to keep them happy and healthy, such as ensuring <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> is available or that they have a home. Additional citizens come from two sources, the birth of children and the arrival of nomads, wandering groups that wish to join the player's town. The player's citizens will age and eventually die.|$|E
5|$|Food {{security}} and food power {{are not the}} same thing. However, they are often directly related. Food security is when all people of a region at all times have <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> for an active, healthy life. Food power is related when a government, company, leader, country etc. takes this security away in order to get something in return. Many countries employ the exploit of food power to threaten another country's food security. A country's welfare correlates directly with the welfare of its people therefore each country wants to have an appropriate supply of food for its citizens. This want, however, can easily be used as leverage in the politics of food, demonstrating food power.|$|E

They talk about the exploitation and abuse they have experienced, describing sexual slavery, physical abuse and difficulties in bringing their traffickers to justice. She also talks to a former trafficker and parents of trafficked children. One trafficked boy says {{that he can not}} go back home because his mother is ill. A mother who trafficked her daughter describes how her family did not have <b>enough</b> <b>food,</b> and how even though they never received the promised payments for her daughter's work, at least she was fed.|$|E

5|$|In {{its early}} stages, esophageal cancer {{may not have}} any {{symptoms}} at all. When severe, esophageal cancer may eventually cause obstruction of the esophagus, making swallowing of any solid foods very difficult and causing weight loss. The progress of the cancer is staged using a system that measures how far into the esophageal wall the cancer has invaded, how many lymph nodes are affected, and whether there are any metastases {{in different parts of}} the body. Esophageal cancer is often managed with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and may also be managed by partial surgical removal of the esophagus. Inserting a stent into the esophagus, or inserting a nasogastric tube, may also be used to ensure that a person is able to digest <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> and water. , the prognosis for esophageal cancer is still poor, so palliative therapy may also be a focus of treatment.|$|E
5|$|Margret Reed {{had managed}} to save <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> for a Christmas pot of soup, {{to the delight of}} her children, but by January they were facing {{starvation}} and considered eating the oxhides that served as their roof. Margret Reed, Virginia, Milt Elliott, and the servant girl Eliza Williams attempted to walk out, reasoning {{that it would be better}} to try to bring food back than sit and watch the children starve. They were gone for four days in the snow before they had to turn back. Their cabin was now uninhabitable; the oxhide-roof served as their food supply, and the family moved in with the Breens. The servants went to live with other families. One day, the Graveses came by to collect on the debt owed by the Reeds and took the oxhides, all that the family had to eat.|$|E
5|$|Militants {{of unknown}} {{affiliation}} fired rockets at United Nations World Food Program (UNWFP) planes on 8 June near Luena and again near Kuito {{a few days}} later. As the first plane, a Boeing 727, approached Luena someone shot a missile at the aircraft, damaging one engine but not critically as the three-man crew landed successfully. The plane's altitude, , most likely prevented the assailant from identifying his target. As the citizens of Luena had <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> to last them several weeks, the UNFWP temporarily suspended their flights. When the flights began again a few days later, militants shot at a plane flying to Kuito, the first attack targeting UN workers since 1999. The UNWFP again suspended food aid flights throughout the country. While he did not claim responsibility for the attack, UNITA spokesman Justino said the planes carried weapons and soldiers rather than food, making them acceptable targets. UNITA and the Angolan government both said the international community needed to pressure the other side into returning to the negotiating table. Despite the looming humanitarian crisis, neither side guaranteed UNWFP planes safety. Kuito, which had relied on international aid, only had <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> to feed their population of 200,000 {{until the end of}} the week. The UNFWP had to fly in all aid to Kuito and the rest of the Central Highlands because militants ambushed trucks. Further complicating the situation, potholes in the Kuito airport strip slowed aid deliveries. Overall chaos reduced the amount of available oil to the point at which the UN had to import its jet fuel.|$|E

5|$|Plants {{and animals}} {{living in the}} desert need special adaptations {{to survive in the}} harsh environment. Plants tend to be tough and wiry with small or no leaves, {{water-resistant}} cuticles and often spines to deter herbivory. Some annual plants germinate, bloom and die {{in the course of a}} few weeks after rainfall while other long-lived plants survive for years and have deep root systems able to tap underground moisture. Animals need to keep cool and find <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> and water to survive. Many are nocturnal and stay in the shade or underground during the heat of the day. They tend to be efficient at conserving water, extracting most of their needs from their food and concentrating their urine. Some animals remain in a state of dormancy for long periods, ready to become active again when the rare rains fall. They then reproduce rapidly while conditions are favorable before returning to dormancy.|$|E
5|$|The {{blockade}} of the South caused the Southern economy to collapse during the war. Shortages {{of food and}} supplies were caused by the blockade, the failure of Southern railroads, the loss of control of the main rivers, and foraging by Union and Confederate armies. The standard of living fell even as large-scale printing of paper money caused inflation and distrust of the currency. By 1864 the internal food distribution had broken down, leaving cities without <b>enough</b> <b>food</b> and causing food riots across the Confederacy. The Union victory at the Second Battle of Fort Fisher in January 1865 closed the last useful Southern port, virtually ending blockade running and hastening {{the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The craft was {{equipped}} with a life-support system consisting of an oxygen generator and devices to avoid oxygen poisoning and to absorb carbon dioxide. A fan, designed to activate whenever the cabin temperature exceeded , was added to keep the dog cool. <b>Enough</b> <b>food</b> (in a gelatinous form) was provided for a seven-day flight, and the dog was fitted with a bag to collect waste. A harness {{was designed to be}} fitted to the dog, and there were chains to restrict her movements to standing, sitting, or lying down; there was no room to turn around in the cabin. An electrocardiogram monitored heart rate and further instrumentation tracked respiration rate, maximum arterial pressure, and the dog's movements.|$|E
