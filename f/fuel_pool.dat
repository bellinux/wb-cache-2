25|$|On 24 June TEPCO {{completed}} {{repairs to}} the Reactor Building Equipment Cooling Water system of Unit 5 which removes {{heat from the}} main <b>Fuel</b> <b>Pool</b> Cooling and Clean-up system {{as well as other}} equipment. The <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> and reactor core are now being cooled simultaneously, the <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> by the <b>Fuel</b> <b>Pool</b> Cooling System and Equipment Cooling Water System and the reactor core by the Residual Heat Removal System. Previously the Residual Heat Removal System was alternately being switched between cooling the reactor core and <b>fuel</b> <b>pool.</b> On 16 September, the same was accomplished in Unit 6 and now the reactors and storage pools of both units are being cooled separately.|$|E
25|$|On December 22, 2014, TEPCO crews {{completed}} {{the removal of}} all fuel assemblies from the spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> of reactor 4. 1331 spent fuel assemblies were moved to the ground-level common spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pool,</b> and 204 unused fuel assemblies were moved to the spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> of reactor 6 (Unit 4 was out of service for refueling {{at the time of}} the 2011 accident, so the spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> contained a number of unused new fuel assemblies).|$|E
25|$|From 20 March, {{seawater}} {{was added}} to the spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> via the <b>Fuel</b> <b>Pool</b> Cooling (FPC) line. Fresh water was used from 29 March.|$|E
25|$|Indian Point stores used {{fuel rods}} in two spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pools</b> at the facility. The spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pools</b> at Indian Point are not stored under a {{containment}} dome like the reactor, but rather they are contained within an indoor 40-foot-deep pool and submerged under 27 feet of water. Water {{is a natural}} and effective barrier to radiation. The spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pools</b> at Indian Point are set in bedrock and are constructed of concrete walls that are four to six feet wide, with a quarter-inch thick stainless steel inner liner. The pools each have multiple redundant backup cooling systems.|$|R
50|$|Since the September 11 {{attacks the}} Nuclear Regulatory Commission has instituted {{a series of}} rules mandating that all <b>fuel</b> <b>pools</b> be {{impervious}} to natural disaster and terrorist attack. As a result, used <b>fuel</b> <b>pools</b> are encased in a steel liner and thick concrete, and are regularly inspected to ensure resilience to earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, and seiches.|$|R

25|$|On 22 December 2014, Tepco crews {{completed}} {{the removal of}} all fuel assemblies, and the spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> of Reactor 4 no longer contained any stored fuel rods. The majority of the spent fuel assemblies were moved to the common spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> {{while some of the}} unused fuel assemblies were moved to the spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> of Unit 6.|$|E
25|$|From 31 March, {{additional}} {{sea water}} {{was added to}} the spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pool,</b> initially by using a concrete pump. Fresh water was used from 14 May. By 29 May water was able to be injected using a temporary pump and the Spent <b>Fuel</b> <b>Pool</b> Cooling (FPC) line.|$|E

25|$|Officials are {{reported}} to have considered insertion or targeted aerial dropping of boric acid, boronated plastic beads or boron carbide pellets into the spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pools</b> to absorb neutrons. France flew 95 tonnes of boron to Japan on 17 March 2011 and the US has provided 9 tons. Neutron absorbing boric acid has been add to water injected into the reactor cores, but is unclear if boron was included with the spraying of spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pools</b> (SFP)s.|$|R
25|$|On 31 May, {{the spent}} <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> was {{switched}} from the water-injection system, to a circulatory cooling system.|$|E
25|$|Reactor 4 was not {{operating}} when the earthquake struck. All fuel rods from Unit 4 had {{been transferred to}} the spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> on an upper floor of the reactor building prior to the tsunami. On 15 March, an explosion damaged the fourth floor rooftop area of Unit 4, creating two large holes in a wall of the outer building. It was reported that water in the spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> might be boiling. Radiation inside the Unit 4 control room prevented workers from staying there for long periods. Visual inspection of the spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> on 30 April revealed no significant damage to the rods. A radiochemical examination of the pond water confirmed that little of the fuel had been damaged.|$|E
25|$|Despite widely voiced concerns, the {{evidence}} suggests that the spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> at Unit 4 did not approach criticality at any stage.|$|E
50|$|High-level {{radioactive}} waste is stored for 10 or 20 years in spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pools,</b> and then {{can be put}} in dry cask storage facilities.|$|R
50|$|The two spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pools</b> at {{the plant}} have 3,074 and 3,076 control rods {{respectively}} with a maximum storage of 3,083 rods per pool.|$|R
50|$|The {{last of the}} 650 {{fuel rods}} {{was removed from the}} reactor on March 18, 2003. They are now stored in spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pools.</b>|$|R
25|$|From 16 June, water {{injection}} to the spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> was switched {{from using the}} concrete pumping vehicle to an alternative {{water injection}} line.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear {{reactors}} {{generate electricity}} {{by using the}} heat of the fission reaction to produce steam, which is used to drive turbines in order to generate electricity. When the reactor stops operating, the radioactive decay of unstable isotopes in the fuel continues to generate heat (decay heat) for a time, and so require continued cooling. Initially this decay heat amounts to approximately 6.5% of the amount produced by fission, decreasing over several days before reaching shutdown levels. Afterwards, spent fuel rods typically require several years in a spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> before they can be safely transferred to dry cask storage vessels. The decay heat in the Unit 4 spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> had the capacity to boil about 70 metric tons of water per day.|$|E
25|$|On 8 November workers did enter reactor-building no. 4, and {{inspected}} {{the place to}} {{determine the cause of}} the hydrogen-blast on 15 March 2011. They found the 5th floor more severely damaged compared with the 4th floor, where the spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> was located. The fuel itself was found undamaged. The workers also found a severely damaged air conditioning duct on floor 5. These findings did not support earlier assumptions that the hydrogen in the blast originated from the spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> of reactor 4, but instead proved that the explosion was caused by hydrogen from the number 3 reactor, after the valves were opened. The hydrogen reached the fifth floor of reactor building 4 through the aforementioned damaged air conditioning duct.|$|E
25|$|Plant {{workers were}} put in the {{position}} of trying to cope simultaneously with core meltdowns at three reactors and exposed <b>fuel</b> <b>pools</b> at three units.|$|R
2500|$|Failure of {{emergency}} power following the tsunami resulted in loss of coolant from each reactor, hydrogen explosions damaging the reactor buildings, and water draining from open-air spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pools.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 8 April 2011, a small 3.8 liter leak of {{radioactive}} water spilled from spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pools</b> holding <b>fuel</b> rods following an aftershock from the March 2011 Tōhoku earthquake.|$|R
25|$|Japan's {{nuclear safety}} agency NISA {{reported}} two holes, each 8 meters square, or 64 m² (690 sq ft), {{in a wall}} of the outer building of Unit 4 after the explosion. At 17:48 {{it was reported that}} water in the spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> might be boiling. By 21:13 on 15 March, radiation inside the Unit 4 control room prevented workers from staying there permanently. Seventy staff remained at the plant, while 800 had been evacuated. By 22:30, TEPCO was reportedly unable to pour water into the spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pool.</b> By 22:50, the company was considering using helicopters to drop water, but this was postponed because of concerns over safety and effectiveness, and the use of high-pressure fire hoses was considered instead.|$|E
25|$|On 10 August, {{the spent}} <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> was {{switched}} from the water-injection system – that functioned some 5 months – to a circulatory cooling system. For {{the first time}} since the 11 March disaster, all four damaged reactors at the plant were using circulatory cooling systems with heat-exchangers.|$|E
25|$|On 28 May, the {{temporary}} seawater cooling pump for Reactor 5 stopped, which {{was discovered by}} TEPCO at 21 local time. At that time, {{the temperature in the}} reactor was 68°C, and in the spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> 41°C. At 11 in the morning the following day the temperatures had risen to 92.2°C and 45.7°C. Cooling was restored at 12:49.|$|E
50|$|If {{there is}} a {{prolonged}} interruption of cooling due to emergency situations, {{the water in the}} spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pools</b> may boil off, possibly resulting in radioactive elements being released into the atmosphere.|$|R
50|$|Because {{they are}} hot both radioactively and thermally, {{this is done}} via cranes and under water. For this reason the spent <b>fuel</b> storage <b>pools</b> are above the reactor in typical installations. They are {{shielded}} by water several times their height, and stored in rigid arrays in which their geometry is controlled to avoid criticality. In the Fukushima reactor incident this became problematic because water was lost from one or more spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pools</b> and the earthquake could have altered the geometry. The fact that the fuel rods' cladding is a zirconium alloy was also problematic since this element can react with steam at extreme temperatures to produce hydrogen, which can ignite with oxygen in the air. Normally the fuel rods are kept sufficiently cool in the reactor and spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pools</b> {{that this is not}} a concern, and the cladding remains intact for the life of the rod.|$|R
50|$|The Fukushima {{disaster}} cleanup is {{an ongoing}} attempt to limit radioactive contamination from the three nuclear reactors involved in the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster which followed the earthquake and tsunami on 11 March 2011.The affected reactors were adjacent {{to one another and}} accident management was made much more difficult {{because of the number of}} simultaneous hazards concentrated in a small area. Failure of emergency power following the tsunami resulted in loss of coolant from each reactor, hydrogen explosions damaging the reactor buildings, and water draining from open-air spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pools.</b> Plant workers were put in the position of trying to cope simultaneously with core meltdowns at three reactors and exposed <b>fuel</b> <b>pools</b> at three units.|$|R
25|$|Dry cask storage {{typically}} involves taking {{waste from}} a spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> and sealing it (along with an inert gas) in a steel cylinder, which {{is placed in}} a concrete cylinder which acts as a radiation shield. It is a relatively inexpensive method which can be done at a central facility or adjacent to the source reactor. The waste can be easily retrieved for reprocessing.|$|E
25|$|A {{nuclear reactor}} {{is only part}} of the {{life-cycle}} for nuclear power. The process starts with mining (see Uranium mining). Uranium mines are underground, open-pit, or in-situ leach mines. In any case, the uranium ore is extracted, usually converted into a stable and compact form such as yellowcake, and then transported to a processing facility. Here, the yellowcake is converted to uranium hexafluoride, which is then enriched using various techniques. At this point, the enriched uranium, containing more than the natural 0.7% U-235, is used to make rods of the proper composition and geometry for the particular reactor that the fuel is destined for. The fuel rods will spend about 3 operational cycles (typically 6 years total now) inside the reactor, generally until about 3% of their uranium has been fissioned, then they will be moved to a spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> where the short lived isotopes generated by fission can decay away. After about 5 years in a spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> the spent fuel is radioactively and thermally cool enough to handle, and it can be moved to dry storage casks or reprocessed.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Entergy workers while digging {{discovered}} a small leak in a spent <b>fuel</b> <b>pool.</b> Water containing tritium and strontium-90 was leaking {{through a crack}} in the pool building and then finding its way into the nearby Hudson River. Workers were able to keep the spent fuel rods safely covered despite the leak. On March 22, 2006 The New York Times also reported finding radioactive nickel-63 and strontium in groundwater on site.|$|E
40|$|Phenomena of {{ignition}} and flame spread above liquid <b>fuel</b> <b>pools</b> are studied and {{factors that can}} improve fire safety are determined. Dominant mechanisms for convective heat transfer and impact on {{ignition and}} flame spread above liquid <b>fuel</b> <b>pools</b> will be determined from these efforts. The approach is: (1) analytical and computational studies to evaluate scaling factors; (2) experimental design, development, and operation in laboratory at Earth's gravity; (3) experimental design for drop towers at NASA Lewis Research Center; (4) development and operation of drop tower experiments together with NASA Lewis Research personnel and; (5) develop recommendations for Lear Jet and/or Space Shuttle experiments. Through this research, a mathematical model of two-phase systems is formulated and is being coded for the computer...|$|R
