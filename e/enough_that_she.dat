5|$|Connections among Coolbrith's {{circle of}} friends {{resulted}} in a librarian job at San Francisco's Mercantile Library Association in 1898, and she moved back to Russian Hill in San Francisco. In January 1899, artist William Keith and poet Charles Keeler obtained for her a part-time position as librarian of the Bohemian Club, of which Keith and Keeler were members. Her first assignment was to edit Songs from Bohemia, a book of poems by Daniel O'Connell, Bohemian Club co-founder and journalist, following his death. Her salary was $50 each month, less than she had been earning in Oakland, but her duties were light <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was able to devote {{a greater proportion of}} her time to writing, and she signed on as sometime staff of Charles Fletcher Lummis's The Land of Sunshine magazine. As a personal project, she began to work on a history of California literature.|$|E
5|$|Rusalka, {{named after}} the mythological creature, was ordered on 25 January 1865 and {{construction}} began on 10 June at the Admiralty Shipyard, Saint Petersburg, although the formal keel-laying was not until 6 June 1866. She was launched on 12 September 1867 and completed in 1869 {{at the cost of}} 762,000 rubles. Construction was considerably delayed by late deliveries of drawings, material, and the death of her original builder. The ship struck an uncharted rock off the Finnish coast in June 1869 and damaged her bottom plating badly <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had to be run aground to prevent her from sinking. Rusalka served her entire career with the Baltic Fleet and was assigned to the Artillery Training Detachment in March 1870. The ship had her boilers replaced in 1878 and 1891 and she was reclassified as a coast-defense ironclad on 13 February 1892.|$|E

A single dive bomber was lost during the {{consequent}} airstrike that sank the destroyer and damaged Neosho badly <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had to be scuttled a few days later. Late in the afternoon, the Japanese launched a small airstrike, without any escorting fighters, based on an erroneous spot report. The American carriers were far closer to the Japanese than they realized and roughly in line with their intended target. Alerted by radar, some of the American Combat Air Patrol (CAP) was vectored to intercept the Japanese aircraft, the rest being retained near the carriers because of bad weather and fading daylight. The American fighters mauled the Japanese attackers who were forced to call off the attack, {{but some of the}} surviving Japanese pilots became confused in the darkness and attempted to verify if the American carriers were their own before being driven off.|$|E

5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Navarins actions during the Battle of Tsushima on 27–28 May as {{there were very few}} {{survivors}} from the ship and visibility was poor for most of the battle. The ship was apparently not heavily engaged during {{the early part of the}} battle, but was badly damaged later in the day when she was third from last in the Russian line of battle. She was hit four times by large-caliber shells on the waterline that caused major flooding aft. Her quarterdeck was awash up to her rear 12-inch turret by 2100 and the ship was forced to stop for repairs. Around that time she was attacked by Japanese torpedo boats that may have made one or two torpedo hits. Navarin managed to get underway again and damaged one torpedo boat badly <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> sank later that night. Around 0200 on 28 May, the ship was attacked again by the Fourth Destroyer Division which dropped six strings of mines ahead of her. These consisted of four mines linked together with cables so that hitting any part of the string would draw the mines onto the ship. Two of these mines struck Navarin, which quickly capsized and sank. Some 70 men were able to abandon ship before she sank, but only three were alive when they were found 16 hours later. One man was rescued by a Japanese torpedo boat while the other two were rescued by a British merchant ship. The rest of her crew of 674 officers and enlisted men were lost. The rescued men had said that when they called out for help, they were fired on by Japanese torpedo boats.|$|E

500|$|Another H6K {{spotted the}} Americans {{during the morning}} of 6 May and {{successfully}} shadowed them until 1400. The Japanese, however, were {{unwilling or unable to}} launch air strikes in poor weather or without updated spot reports. Both sides believed they knew where the other force was, and expected to fight the next day. The Japanese were the first to spot the Americans when one aircraft found the oiler Neosho escorted by the destroyer [...] at 0722, south of the Strike Force. They were misidentified as a carrier and a cruiser so the fleet carriers Shōkaku and Zuikaku launched an airstrike forty minutes later that sank Sims and damaged Neosho badly <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had to be scuttled a few days later.

The scene was shot in one take using an artificial torso filled with blood and viscera, with Hurt's head and arms coming up from underneath the table. The chestburster was shoved up through the torso by a puppeteer who held it on a stick. When the creature burst through the chest a stream of blood shot directly at Veronica Cartwright, shocking her <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> fell over and went into hysterics.

500|$|Jean Bart was {{refitted}} again between 7 August 1929 and 29 September 1931. This {{was much}} more extensive than her earlier refit as another set of boilers was converted to oil-firing, her direct-drive cruising turbines were replaced by geared turbines and her fire-control systems were comprehensively upgraded. A large cruiser-type fire-control director was added atop the foremast with a 4.57-m coincidence rangefinder and a [...] stereo rangefinder. The rangefinder above the conning tower {{was replaced by a}} duplex unit carrying two 4.57-m rangefinders and another 4.57-m rangefinder was added in an armoured hood next to the main mast.

Kongō was in Honolulu on one of these cruises during the Hawaiian Revolution of 1893, although the ship played no part in the affair. She returned to Hawaii the next year and briefly became the patrol ship there until the start of the First Sino-Japanese War later in 1894. Kongō did not participate in the Battle of the Yalu River, but Hiei was there.

Eventually, after offloading [...] of cargo from her front hold onto lighters called to the scene, ten steam tugs and power from Princess Alices own engines freed the ship at 01:47 on 28May, almost 15hours after running aground.

[...] According to Tales, Then and Now: More Folktales as Literary Fictions for Young Adults author Anna E.

In his book Hearing a Film, Seeing a Sermon: Preaching and Popular Movies, author Timothy B. Cargal agreed that the character indicated [...] "Disney's ... continued efforts to reshape their heroines for a more feminist age." [...] According to Girl Culture: An Encyclopedia author Claudia Mitchell, Belle's feminism was influenced by third-wave feminism and the relatively new concept of girl power during the 1990s. Feminist critics have been generally mixed in their analyses of Belle, arguing {{over whether or not}} the character is in fact [...] "feminist enough." [...] Although Beauty and the Beast was initially lauded upon release for starring a [...] "forward thinking and feminist" [...] heroine, critics tend to agree that, in spite of Belle's independence and resentment towards Gaston, Beauty and the Beast essentially remains a romance about a girl who finally [...] "meets her ideal man." [...] Acknowledging that Belle [...] "represented significant change from [...] sweet, mop-wielding predecessors," [...] Twilight and History author Nancy Reagin observed that [...] "the end result of fulfillment through marriage has been maintained." [...] Kathleen Maher of The Austin Chronicle cited Belle as an example of [...] "pseudo-feminism" [...] because she rejects one man, Gaston, in favor of another, a prince. While commending Belle for [...] "seeing past the beast's appearance," [...] Judith Welikala of The Independent in the end accused the character of [...] "melting back into the role of wife when he turns back into a handsome prince." [...] Fairy Tale author Andrew Teverson referred to Belle as Disney's attempt to address [...] "feminist criticism of its representation of women in earlier films," [...] but ultimately criticized the character's curiosity for [...] "extend only to romance," [...] additionally accusing her of being [...] "a zealous individualist with a pathological hostility to common men and women." [...] Meanwhile, Stylist ranked Belle among the most feminist Disney characters, describing her as an [...] "incredibly intelligent" [...] woman who [...] "doesn't stand for a man who considers her as just a piece of meat ... she wants someone who loves her for her mind too." [...] Acknowledging the character's [...] "feminist longings," [...] Daniel Eagen, author of America's Film Legacy: The Authoritative Guide to the Landmark Movies in the National Film Registry, cited Belle as Disney's [...] "modern-day corrective to Snow White." [...] Beyond Adaptation: Essays on Radical Transformations of Original Works author Phyllis Frus wrote that, initially, Beauty and the Beast does not seem [...] "remotely feminist." [...] However, the author did acknowledge Belle as [...] "an appealing character with a noticeable feminist streak," [...] but in the end criticized Disney's Consumer Products of reversing what the film had nearly accomplished by inducting the character into the Disney Princess franchise. In Refinery29's [...] "Definitive Ranking Of Disney Princesses As Feminist Role Models," [...] author Vanessa Golembewski ranked the character eighth but described her personality and ambitions as [...] "confusing."
