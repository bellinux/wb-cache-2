60|$|There {{was a girl}} he had met at one {{of these}} studio contrivances--a glorious, impudent, lucid, open-minded girl with <b>hair</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> Culmbacher, and a good-natured way of despising you. She was a New York girl.|$|E
6000|$|... "What? The old man's daughter. Comes in {{the shop}} every day. About nineteen, and {{the picture of the}} blonde that sits on the palisades of the Rhine and charms the clam-diggers into the surf. <b>Hair</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> straw matting, and eyes as black and shiny as the best harness blacking--think of that! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This Mrs. Avery was a solace and a balm to the eyesight. She had <b>hair</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> {{the back}} of a twenty dollar gold certificate, blue eyes and a system of beauty that would make the girl on the cover of a July {{magazine}} look like a cook on a Monongahela coal barge.|$|E

5000|$|He was [...] "Tall and handsome, fair-skinned and {{slightly}} ruddy... his <b>hair</b> was <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> a very mature hazelnut, the nose a little snub, the eyes between green and blue... {{he had very}} graceful legs and feet and hands." ...|$|R
50|$|Final Challenge: Each stylist {{is given}} {{three hours to}} cut and style four models. They were tasked with {{creating}} looks {{to tell the story}} of one woman during the ages eighteen, thirty, forty-five, and sixty in her life. Each stylist chose a scissor box which held a lock <b>of</b> <b>hair,</b> indicating <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> models they would be working with.|$|R
60|$|Even at {{any time}} {{she would have been}} an enchanting vision to these men, but in the glow of {{exercise}} and sparkle of anger she was bewildering. Her wonderful <b>hair,</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> freshly hewn redwood, had escaped from her hat in her passage through the underbrush, and even as she swept down upon them in her majesty she was jabbing a hairpin into it with a dexterous feminine hand.|$|E
60|$|Two {{little girls}} were {{standing}} in the lane below. The elder, who had spoken in that small, anxious voice, had a pale little face with pointed chin; her <b>hair,</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> over-ripe corn, hung fluffy on her thin shoulders, her flower-like eyes, with something motherly in them already, were the same hue as her pale-blue, almost clean, overall. She had her smaller, chubbier sister by the hand, and, having delivered her message, stood still, gazing up at Tod, as one might at God. Tod dropped his hoe.|$|E
60|$|He was {{rough-hewn}} indeed, with gray-green eyes, and <b>hair</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> golden sand: {{it would}} not stay brushed. It was this hair that hinted most strongly of individualism, that {{was by no means}} orthodox. Langmaid felt an incongruity, but he was fascinated; and he had discovered on the rector's shelves evidences of the taste for classical authors that he himself possessed. Thus fate played with him, and the two men ranged from Euripides to Horace, from Horace to Dante and Gibbon. And when Hodder got up to fetch this or that edition, he seemed to tower over the lawyer, who was a big man himself.|$|E
50|$|Their skin is {{thin and}} soft with gleaming <b>hair.</b> <b>The</b> main <b>colors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breed are {{chestnut}} and bay, with characteristic golden tint of the breed. They {{can also be}} gray. Rarely they can be Palomino or Buckskin. White markings are allowed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, my {{pretty little}} bird," [...] {{said the old}} goose-herd, [...] "thou wilt make a fine Princess!" [...] But, prut! she was no more like a Princess than I am, for she was squat, and round-shouldered, and had <b>hair</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> tow.|$|R
50|$|Domino: A were-tiger {{with the}} ability to change into either a black tiger or a white tiger. His <b>hair</b> {{reflects}} <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tiger he last changed into. In the beginning he is very wary of Anita, but she unintentionally wins him over as the black tiger clan is scarce in members.|$|R
60|$|Aunt Emma had {{the soul}} of a six-foot dowager duchess, and should have had an eagle nose and a white pompadour. Actually, she was of medium height, with a not unduly {{maternal}} bosom, a broad, commonplace face, <b>hair</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> faded grass, a blunt nose with slightly enlarged pores, and thin lips that seemed to be a straight line when seen from in front, but, seen in profile, puffed out like a fish's. She had a habit of nodding intelligently even when she was not listening, and another habit of rubbing her left knuckles with the fingers of her right hand. Not imposing in appearance was Aunt Emma Truegate Winslow, but she was born to discipline a court.|$|E
60|$|The {{light from}} a half-opened shutter fell full upon her rebellious little figure. She had {{stiffened}} herself in a large easy-chair into the attitude {{in which she had}} been evidently deposited there by the nurse whose torn-off apron she still held rigidly in one hand. Her shapely legs stood out before her, jointless and inflexible to the point of her tiny shoes--a POSE copied with pathetic fidelity by the French doll at her feet. The attitude must have been dreadfully uncomfortable, and maintained only as being replete with some vague insults to the person who had put her down, as exhibiting a wild indecorum of silken stocking. A mystified kitten--Sarah Walker's inseparable--was held as rigidly under one arm with equal dumb aggressiveness. Following the stiff line of her half-recumbent figure, her head suddenly appeared perpendicularly erect--yet the only mobile part of her body. A dazzling sunburst of silky <b>hair,</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> burnished copper, partly hid her neck and shoulders and the back of the chair. Her eyes were a darker shade of the same color--the orbits appearing deeper and larger from the rubbing in of habitual tears from long wet lashes. Nothing so far seemed inconsistent with her infelix reputation, but, strange to say, her other features were marked by delicacy and refinement, and her mouth--that sorely exercised and justly dreaded member--was small and pretty, albeit slightly dropped at the corners.|$|E

50|$|The {{cover for}} the album is of Jim Morrison's {{character}} portrayed by Val Kilmer. It is a photo of Kilmer looking straight in the camera's lens. His face is {{in black and white}} and his <b>hair</b> has <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> burning flames, it is the same effect created on the movie's posters and advertising material.|$|R
5000|$|Brown went {{by various}} nicknames in {{different}} circles of friends. To her Dana School and Hollins friends she was [...] "Tim", as her <b>hair</b> was <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> timothy hay. To Bank Street friends she was [...] "Brownie". To William Gaston she was [...] "Goldie", {{in keeping with}} the use of Golden MacDonald as author of The Little Island.|$|R
60|$|In {{that almost}} bare room {{a young woman}} sat sewing at a machine. She nodded to Kenwitz as to a {{familiar}} acquaintance. One little stream of sunlight through the dingy window burnished her heavy <b>hair</b> to <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> an ancient Tuscan's shield. She flashed a rippling smile at Kenwitz and a look of somewhat flustered inquiry.|$|R

5000|$|Hemingway biographer James Mellow argues the [...] "ideas {{of sexual}} transference" [...] {{did not become}} clear in Hemingway's fiction until he wrote The Garden of Eden.

60|$|The {{first was}} an {{artificial}} product known as Bryan Jacks--a name that had obviously met with reverses. Jacks was {{the outcome of}} paved cities. He was a small man made of some material resembling flexible sandstone. His <b>hair</b> was <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> a brick Quaker meeting-house; his eyes were twin cranberries; his mouth was like the aperture under a drop-letters-here sign.|$|R
5000|$|Her {{red hair}} color (she is a [...] "natural brunette") {{was the idea}} of Sydney Guilaroff, a hairdresser who changed <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> other famous actresses such as Lucille Ball.|$|R
50|$|Selenium {{disulfide}} {{can cause}} discoloration of <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> and alter <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> dyes. It may also discolor metallic jewellery. Selenium monosulfide (SeS) {{is the only}} selenium compound so far identified as a carcinogen in animals.|$|R
5000|$|Alphito (Ἀλφιτώ) is {{a supernatural}} being first {{recorded}} in the Moralia of Plutarch, where [...] "apotropaic nursery tales" [...] about her are told by nursemaids to frighten little children into behaving. Her name is related to alphita, [...] "white flour" [...] (compare Latin albus), and alphitomanteia, a form of divination (-manteia) from flour or barley meal. She was presumably old, with white <b>hair</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> flour.|$|E
50|$|The {{hair color}} of mummies or buried bodies can change. Hair {{contains}} {{a mixture of}} black-brown-yellow eumelanin and red pheomelanin. Eumelanin is less chemically stable than pheomelanin and breaks down faster when oxidized. It {{is for this reason}} that Egyptian mummies have reddish <b>hair.</b> <b>The</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> hair changes faster under extreme conditions. It changes more slowly under dry oxidizing conditions (such as in burials in sand or in ice) than under wet reducing conditions (such as burials in wood or plaster coffins).|$|E

50|$|Zillah is Nothing's {{father as}} well as his lover. His {{distinguishing}} features include his crazy green eyes and the purple, green, and gold-dyed streaks in his <b>hair</b> - <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>of</b> Mardi Gras. He is described as being incredibly beautiful - androgynous, slender, and shorter than Molochai and Twig, with pierced nipples and sharp, black-lacquered nails. He is portrayed throughout the novel as cruel, insensitive, and violent (sexually and otherwise), but he displays fondness for Nothing.|$|R
50|$|Joe Binks: Joe, as {{depicted}} on the cover, has <b>hair</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> honey, and typically wears a blue jumper. He is entering his adolescent years, and is grappling issues {{with his mother}} and father's divorce. He is less than thrilled when his father tells him that he will be spending Christmas with his mother, Merle. While Joe can behave in a very juvenile fashion, he continued to mock Twiggy's teas that she prepared for trading in the Midnight Market, he is also a very caring young man as he demonstrates when he assists the betterment of the magical community over searching for his father, and when he spares the last bit of thawing potion for the dying Dunkel.|$|E
50|$|Hearing this, many urged Fedlimid to {{kill the}} baby at birth, but Conchobar, aroused by the {{description}} of her future beauty, decided to keep the child for himself. He took Deirdre away from her family and had her brought up in seclusion by Leabharcham, a poet and wise woman, and planned to marry Deirdre when she was old enough. As a young girl, living isolated in the woodlands, Deirdre one snowy day told Leabharcham that she would love a man with the colours she had seen when a raven landed in the snow with its prey: <b>hair</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> the raven, skin as white as snow, and cheeks as red as blood.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2013 YouTube user Exnyker {{shared an}} {{unconfirmed}} information writing that [...] "there were other tracks Kathleen Emery recorded - but this 7" [...] single {{was the only}} one released. I'd heard the demo recordings (I'm going back to 1969, here...), and one of the songs was actually very pretty. I think it was a song written for her - about her son, who had died many years before. The song was called [...] "He Had <b>Hair</b> <b>the</b> <b>Color</b> <b>of</b> Wheat"[...]. Clark Gardner was her voice teacher, back in the late 1960s. (Clark was a friend of mine - and would play me these tracks.) She was an older woman, who had money, and wanted a career - badly. These recordings were tracks she paid for[...]. Around 1970, she did some cruise ships. She died, somewhere around 1972-1973." ...|$|E
50|$|Yellow-green {{couplers}} include resorcinol, 4-chlororesorcinol, and benzodioxoles. These compounds produce broad-band absorption {{when they}} {{react to form}} dyes, allowing for more natural-looking <b>hair</b> <b>colors.</b> <b>The</b> combination <b>of</b> 2,5-diaminotoluene with the coupler resorcinol gives a greenish brown dye.|$|R
5000|$|In 1885, John Beddoe {{compiled}} {{an index}} of negrescence to analyze {{the population of the}} British Isles. Beddoe used the physical descriptions of a population of 13,000 males to compile his index. He gave one point to a male with red or blonde hair. He gave one point to men with dark hair as well. A black-haired male was given two points. If the male had brown- or chestnut-colored, hair, they were considered neutral. He created a map that showed distribution of negrescence in Britain. This map was recreated and published by R. H. Hodgkin in 1935. It showed that <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> men in western Scotland, Wales, and Ireland was darker than <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> males in eastern England and eastern Scotland.|$|R
25|$|Eggs {{take about}} 14 days to hatch into larvae, which eat continuously. They have a {{preference}} for white mulberry, having an attraction to the mulberry odorant cis-jasmone. They are not monophagous since they can eat other species of Morus, {{as well as some}} other Moraceae, mostly Osage orange. They are covered with tiny black <b>hairs.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> their heads turns darker, it indicates they are about to molt. After molting, the instar phase of the silkworms emerge white, naked, and with little horns on their backs.|$|R
