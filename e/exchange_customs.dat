40|$|Innovation and {{entrepreneurship}} {{are recognized}} by many scholars {{as two of}} the key factors in company, regional and ultimately national growth. Up until now scholars have focused on macro level research leading to theories such as different innovation systems which explain how society through legislation and other incentives can facilitate the collaboration process between e. g. industry and academy leading to innovation. Despite this interest in the innovation process little effort {{has been made to}} elucidate how collaboration and innovation occurs from an individual perspective. This process involves individuals that interact in a knowledge exchange process. Boundary spanners have been identified as facilitators and drivers of innovative processes between organizations. Their extensive networks enable them to distinguish collaboration opportunities and win-win situations with outside partners. In most industries boundary spanners are quite uncommon but within the life science sector many employees are potential boundary spanners since they often have an academic background and thus a good network with a major collaboration partner. We decided to look into the life science industry in order to investigate the exchange process in innovation collaborations and the role of academic background among boundary spanners. The research question that has guided this thesis was set to; what prominent <b>exchange</b> <b>customs</b> exist among these boundary spanners and what does the background of these individuals have for these exchanges? To be able to answer our research question and fulfill our aim we have made a qualitative hermeneutical study. By using a pending approach between deduction and induction we have continuously created understanding during the process of our theoretical and empirical generation. By performing five in-depth interviews with representatives from three different life science organizations we investigated how collaboration processes with academia are built and what role academic background can have for the boundary spanners involved. From our empirical findings we derived answers to meet our aim;"identify prominent <b>exchange</b> <b>customs</b> among boundary spanners in innovation processes between academic and industry partners. " <b>Exchange</b> <b>customs</b> were dependent on foremost networking procedures or procedures indirectly dependent in networks. The actions of searching, screening and signalling were found to be central in the innovation process and for <b>exchange</b> <b>customs.</b> Furthermore we answered two set of sub-purposes;(i) what role does academic background have for the development of <b>exchange</b> <b>customs</b> and procedures pursued by boundary spanners in industry? and(ii) how can background knowledge of academia contribute to or mitigate exchanges between boundary spanners in industry and academia? The role of academic background was found to contribute significantly to all network dependent activities such as the above mentioned <b>exchange</b> <b>customs.</b> Moreover, we identified the process of academic self contact, i. e. when academia approaches industry with ideas, which could be a direct effect from signalling processes or personal networks. Background knowledge about academia affects <b>exchange</b> <b>customs</b> since it creates {{a better understanding of the}} academic partners' needs. ...|$|E

Judging from the commercial aspect, these commodities are industrial raw materials in the country, so its presence should be maintained and further improved. Like other plants, one obstacle to increased production of tobacco plants is a bacterial wilt disease caused by Ralstonia solanacearum, {{which is one of the}} important diseases in plants. The use of antagonistic microorganisms in controlling plant diseases is one way of controlling the more economical compared to chemical control. Bacillus is one of the antagonistic microorganisms that can be used as a barrier to the growth of R. solanacearum. This study aims to determine the effect of artificial media for bacterial growth and antagonistic effectiveness against R. solanacearum causes wilt disease in tobacco (Nicotiana tabaccum). Hypothesis in this study is expected that the artificial media have an influence on bacterial growth and effectiveness of the antagonists R. solanacearum.

In this survey, an open view of Hinduism and economics is encouraged that sees both as composed of complex institutions, <b>exchanges,</b> <b>customs,</b> beliefs and people. Of course facets of religion, like ritual or scripture, are not contingent on social, political, and economic change; however, people and their everyday lives are equally interconnected with both economics and religion so that both can co-exist and act upon each other (Flood, 1996). A starting point in this summary is that economics includes infrastructure, well-being, charity, philanthropy, and other “soft 2 ̆ 2 factors. While it is true that economists have dabbled in religion, as inputs in economic modeling or as values in quantitative surveys, these efforts have tended toward understanding religion as a closed phenomenon outside of economic activity. Yet, in the case of India, as Deepak Lal has documented in detail in Hindu Equilibrium (2005), what might appear to be economic stagnation by some accounts - principally neoliberal - is in fact evidence of the ongoing social order and continuity of a Hinduism spanning over miIlennia. According to Lal, this social equilibrium was in many ways disrupted by the colonial order and sensitivity is demanded in appraising Hinduism from this longitudinal perspective...|$|R

Haplogroups A, C and D have clinal tendencies in Colombia and South America in general. Populations belonging to the Chibcha linguistic family of Colombia and other countries nearby showed a strong genetic differentiation from the other populations tested, thus corroborating previous findings. Genetically, the Ingano, Paez and Guambiano populations are more closely related to other groups of south eastern Colombia, as also inferred from other genetic markers and from archeological data.

The <b>exchange</b> of <b>customs</b> and food was bidirectional, with Arabs also exporting their dietary preferences such as dates, figs, and lamb to the areas they traveled to or conquered including the Persian empire and the Turkish population of Balkan. This interchange of goods and ways of life, was significant in forming the current modern Arab diet. Interestingly, Arabs later on transferred these newly gained cuisines on their conquests to Africa, and as far as North Africa, West Africa, and South of Spain. In fact, certain Spanish desserts such as polvorones, tocino de cielo (custard and caramel) and yemas de San Leandro (marzipan based) are heavily influenced by the Moors. Though these influences were not carried out by the original Arabs of the Arabian sub-continent, their west ward expansion into Egypt, and Morocco led to dissemination of Chinese, Indian, Arabian, and Persian cuisines and eventually their vicarious adoption by the North Africans.|$|R

The increased use of ICT technologies has been proposed to enable a more attractive compromise between customs and trade risks. This study investigates the impact of the proposed new measures, including the use of technology, on the efficiency of cross-border freight movements. The research approach will combine the analysis of historical electronic transaction data <b>exchanged</b> between <b>customs</b> and consignors, with the simulation of different scenarios for the ICT support of customs processes.

40|$|Abstract – The {{purpose of}} marketplaces in an {{economic}} sense is the offering of a venue for selling and buying goods. On the internet, virtual marketplaces for trading goods have also been known since the 1990 s. More recently, the marketplace idea has been extended towards the <b>exchange</b> of highly-specialised, <b>custom</b> services which are technically implemented as redistributable web services. As opposed to tradable goods which are sold at a discrete point in time, the service marketplace retains its functionality beyond the purchase through continuous contracting and management of services. This additional activity increases the amount of required resources. For a scalable exchange between thousands of users, the underlying system and middleware thus needs to adhere to scalability principles known from service-oriented architectures.
