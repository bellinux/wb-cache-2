5|$|As a human institution, Byzantium {{under the}} Komnenoi {{played a key}} role in the history of the Crusades in the Holy Land, while also exerting {{enormous}} cultural and political influence in Europe, the Near East, and the lands around the Mediterranean Sea. The Komnenian emperors, particularly John and Manuel, exerted great influence over the Crusader states of Outremer, whilst Alexios <b>I</b> <b>played</b> a key role in the course of the First Crusade, which he helped bring about.|$|E
5|$|Asked {{what impact}} {{the money would}} have on him, Kinsler said: I'm {{going to play the}} same {{regardless}} of whether I'm making five dollars or $1 trillion. It really doesn't make a difference to me. I'm {{going to go out there}} and play hard, and money doesn't bring respect. The way you play the game brings respect. When I finish playing the game, it's not how much money I made that is going to be my legacy. It's how <b>I</b> <b>played</b> the game, and what I did on the field.|$|E
5|$|I {{remember}} {{being in the}} back part of the studio, and we were sitting there {{late at night and}} writing. I was strolling through some sounds and came upon a particular sound from a steel acoustic guitar. <b>I</b> <b>played</b> these really beautiful chord changes that eventually led to 'My All.' She started singing and I started playing, and we came up with the basis for the song. I put a little drum groove down {{and it was one of}} the easier songs to write with her.|$|E

5|$|In {{the centre}} of the quad is the Harris Building, {{formerly}} Oriel court, a real tennis court where Charles <b>I</b> <b>played</b> tennis with his nephew Prince Rupert in December 1642 and King Edward VII had his first tennis lesson in 1859. The building was in use as a lecture hall by 1923, and after modernisation between 1991 and 1994, funded by Sir Philip and Lady Harris, contains accommodation, a seminar room and the college's main lecture theatre. The bronze plaque in the lobby commemorates Sir Philip's father, Captain Charles William Harris, after whom the building is named. The building was opened by John Major, then Prime Minister, on 10 August 1993.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Fischer {{stayed at}} the home of {{grandmaster}} Peter Biyiasas, where, over a period of four months, he defeated Biyiasas seventeen times in a series of speed games. In an interview with Sports Illustrated reporter William Nack, Biyiasas assessed Fischer's play:He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. It was like I was being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing thing about it is that I wasn't even getting out of the middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. He honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of him. <b>I</b> <b>played</b> him, and I can attest to that.|$|E

25|$|Ray Illingworth's England side in 1970-71 were mentally {{the toughest}} English side <b>I</b> <b>played</b> against, and the {{experience}} of playing against them first up in my Test career reinforced what I had learnt in the backyard. Test cricket was not for the faint of heart. Illingworth subjected us to a mental intimidation by aggressive field placings, and physical intimidation by constant use of his pace attack, ably led by one of the best fast bowlers of my experience, John Snow. Winning to Illingworth was something he expected of himself and demanded of his team.|$|E

Then again and again, until I had viewed it 25 times. And still I could not believe what I was looking at. To see my officers engage {{in what appeared to}} be excessive use of force, possibly criminally excessive, to see them beat a man with their batons 56 times, to see a sergeant on the scene who did nothing to seize control, was something I never dreamed I would witness.|$|E
25|$|If I {{knew what}} I know now I {{probably}} would have switched. At the time I had already been playing two or three years, {{and it seemed like}} I had been playing a long time. I thought I’d never be able to change the way <b>I</b> <b>played.</b> The reality of the situation was that I hadn’t been playing very long at all, and I probably could have spent {{the same amount of time}} learning to play right handed. I did have a go at it, but I just didn’t have the patience. It seemed impossible to me. I decided to make do with what I had, and I made some plastic fingertips for myself. I just persevered with it.|$|E
25|$|Bob Summers, my brother-in-law, {{has come}} into his own over the years too. Bob and I worked a lot on MGM records with the Mike Curb scene, early 1960s.

Also Bob and I worked at Capitol Records for Ken Nelson and Cliffie Stone, passed recently. Too many country artists to even name nearly all of them: Hank Thompson, Wynn Stewart, Rose Maddox and others.

5000|$|Michel {{distinguished}} himself {{most obviously}} from his primary inspiration {{in that he}} lacked Bill Evans's cerebral approach to the piano. Petrucciani's interest was primarily in simply playing; he spent little time reharmonizing or arranging. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>play,</b> <b>I</b> <b>play</b> with my heart and my head and my spirit… <b>I</b> don't <b>play</b> to people's heads, but to their hearts." [...] he says. The moments of musical clarity or bliss he describes come during his performances. [...] "You know sometimes when <b>I</b> <b>play</b> a concert… and I have that right timing… those notes make me feel warm and good… it's like lovemaking, it's like having an orgasm." [...] Yet despite his emphasis on performance, he disliked applause, calling it old-fashioned and a distraction.|$|R

In 1992, UCF joined the Trans America Athletic Conference (TAAC) in all D-I sports except football, which remained independent. In 1996, UCF was advanced to I-A (FBS) in football, and initially remained independent in football until becoming a football-only member of the Mid-American Conference in 2001, the same year the TAAC became the Atlantic Sun Conference. UCF joined Conference USA (C-USA) in all sports in 2005, and the American Athletic Conference (The American) in 2013.|$|E
