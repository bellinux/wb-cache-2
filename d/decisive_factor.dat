40|$|This {{research}} is an anthropological {{investigation into the}} decision-making processes of unmarried mothers in Tamil Nadu {{with regard to the}} relinquishment or acceptance of their children. This anthropological investigation focuses on these decision-making processes from the mothers' perspectives and elaborates on their experiences, feelings, interests and priorities. Priority has been given to their life stories to bring in the voices of a category of women stifled in a culture that denies their existence. This dissertation is an exploration of the <b>decisive</b> <b>factors</b> as communicated by these mothers. What are the <b>decisive</b> <b>factors</b> that tip the scale towards relinquishing children or raising them against the grain? Relevant notions associated with these <b>decisive</b> <b>factors</b> are contextualized, articulated and mirrored against dominant cultural meanings and discourses...|$|R

5|$|Around 1450 BC, Greece {{was divided}} {{into a series of}} warrior kingdoms, the most {{important}} being centered in Mycenae, Tiryns, Pylos and Thebes. Before the end of the same century, this militaristic civilization replaced the former priestess-dominated civilization of Minoan Cretans in the Aegean. Thus, the Mycenaeans began to build up their maritime power in the Aegean Sea, expanding towards the Aegean Islands and Anatolian coast. The warlike nature of the Mycenaeans was probably a <b>decisive</b> <b>factor</b> in their diplomatic relations towards the other Late Bronze Age powers. Mycenaean warriors were also hired as mercenaries in foreign armies, such as in Egypt.|$|E
5|$|In late 1518, {{the post}} of the Leutpriestertum (people's priest) of the Grossmünster at Zurich became vacant. The canons of the {{foundation}} that administered the Grossmünster recognised Zwingli's reputation as a fine preacher and writer. His connection with humanists was a <b>decisive</b> <b>factor</b> as several canons were sympathetic to Erasmian reform. In addition, {{his opposition to the}} French and to mercenary service was welcomed by Zurich politicians. On 11 December 1518, the canons elected Zwingli to become the stipendiary priest and on 27 December he moved permanently to Zurich.|$|E

5|$|Porter Alexander is {{best known}} as an artilleryman who played a {{prominent}} role in many of the important battles of the war. He served in different artillery capacities for Longstreet's First Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia, starting that role on November 7, 1862, after leaving Lee's staff to command the battalion that was the corps' artillery reserve. He was promoted to colonel on December 5. He was instrumental in arranging the artillery in defense of Marye's Heights at the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862, which proved to be the <b>decisive</b> <b>factor</b> in the Confederate victory. While the rest of Longstreet's corps was located around Suffolk, Virginia, Alexander accompanied Stonewall Jackson on his flanking march at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, and his artillery placements in Hazel Grove at Chancellorsville proved decisive.|$|E
5|$|Sigeberht's Christian {{conversion}} {{may have}} been a <b>decisive</b> <b>factor</b> in his achieving royal power, since at that time Edwin of Northumbria (616–632 or 633) was the senior English king and he and Eadbald, who ruled Kent, were Christian. Eadbald certainly had contacts with the Frankish rulers. After Dagobert succeeded Clothar II in Francia in 628, Sigeberht's emergence helped to strengthen the English conversion upon which Edwin's power rested. Sigeberht is likely to have encouraged the conversion of Ecgric, if he was not already Christian. Edwin's encouragement took shape in the marriage of his grand-niece Hereswitha, sister of Hilda of Whitby, to Æthelric, Rædwald's nephew. Hereswith and Hilda were under Edwin's protection and were baptised with him in 626.|$|E
5|$|The Jagiellon {{rivalry with}} the House of Habsburg in central Europe was {{ultimately}} resolved to the Habsburgs' advantage. The <b>decisive</b> <b>factor</b> that damaged or weakened the monarchies {{of the last}} Jagiellons was the Ottoman Empire's Turkish expansion. Hungary's vulnerability greatly increased after Suleiman the Magnificent took the Belgrade fortress in 1521. To prevent Poland from extending military aid to Hungary, Suleiman had a Tatar-Turkish force raid southeastern Poland–Lithuania in 1524. The Hungarian army was defeated in 1526 at the Battle of Mohács, where the young Louis II Jagiellon, son of Vladislas II, was killed. Subsequently, {{after a period of}} internal strife and external intervention, Hungary was partitioned between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans.|$|E

5|$|The <b>decisive</b> <b>factor</b> {{in favour}} of change in Chicago, however, was the {{economic}} slowdown in the early 1890s, which {{gave way to the}} financial panic of 1893. The recession, combined with the frantic building of the previous few years, meant that Chicago suddenly had a significant surplus of office space, threatening occupancy levels and rents. Regulation was introduced by the city council to control the problem in 1892, with support from the real estate industry who hoped to slow the construction of additional office space and shore up their diminishing profit margins. The height of new buildings was limited to , with lower height levels on narrower streets, effectively curtailing the construction of any taller skyscrapers.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{provided}} {{about two-thirds}} of all the ordnance used by the Allies in terms of warships, transports, warplanes, artillery, tanks, trucks, and ammunition. Though the Allies' economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of Germany and Japan, they became the <b>decisive</b> <b>factor</b> by 1942, after the United States and Soviet Union joined the Allies, as the war largely settled into one of attrition. While the Allies' ability to out-produce the Axis is often attributed to the Allies having more access to natural resources, other factors, such as Germany and Japan's reluctance to employ women in the labour force, Allied strategic bombing, and Germany's late shift to a war economy contributed significantly. Additionally, neither Germany nor Japan planned to fight a protracted war, and were not equipped to do so. To improve their production, Germany and Japan used millions of slave labourers; Germany used about 12 million people, mostly from Eastern Europe, while Japan used more than 18 million people in Far East Asia.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his success}} against the Gepids, Alboin {{had failed to}} greatly {{increase}} his power, and was now faced with a much stronger threat from the Avars. Historians consider this the <b>decisive</b> <b>factor</b> in convincing Alboin to undertake a migration, {{even though there are}} indications that before the war with the Gepids a decision was maturing to leave for Italy, a country thousands of Lombards had seen in the 550s when hired by the Byzantines to fight in the Gothic War. Additionally, the Lombards would have known of the weakness of Byzantine Italy, which had endured a number of problems after being retaken from the Goths. In particular the so-called Plague of Justinian had ravaged the region and conflict remained endemic, with the Three-Chapter Controversy sparking religious opposition and administration at a standstill after the able governor of the peninsula, Narses, was recalled. Nevertheless, the Lombards viewed Italy as a rich land which promised great booty, assets Alboin used to gather together a horde which included not only Lombards but many other peoples of the region, including Heruli, Suebi, Gepids, Thuringii, Bulgars, Sarmatians, the remaining Romans and a few Ostrogoths. But the most important group, other than the Lombards, were the Saxons, of whom 20,000 male warriors with their families participated in the trek. These Saxons were tributaries to the Frankish King Sigebert, and their participation indicates that Alboin had the support of the Franks for his venture.|$|E

40|$|Several {{changes have}} been {{taking place in the}} labour market since the 1970 s that have created the right climate to spur organisations and workers to demand greater {{flexibility}} in employment. In this context, temporary employment {{has been the focus of}} many research papers and temporary contracts have been used as a tool to achieve labour flexibility. In order to understand the situation in Andalusia (Spain), this paper aims to identify the <b>decisive</b> <b>factors</b> in permanent employment. To this end, starting hypotheses will be defined about the <b>decisive</b> <b>factors</b> in permanent employment and the positive or negative significance of their influence; the starting hypotheses will then be tested empirically using a logistic regression model on a sample population of wage earners in Andalusia. In the second stage, given that the ratio of temporary contracts is much higher among women, the variable ‘gender’ is likely to be decisive in the construction of the regression model, therefore the <b>decisive</b> <b>factors</b> for permanent employment in Andalusia will be evaluated separately for men and women, in order to calibrate the impact of gender on job stability. Finally, based on the estimated probabilities of having a permanent job depending on gender, the degree of labour discrimination faced by women in the Andalusian labour market will be analysed...|$|R
