5|$|Explosive eruptions {{occur when}} magma decompresses as it rises, {{allowing}} dissolved volatiles (dominantly water and carbon dioxide) to exsolve into gas bubbles. As more bubbles nucleate a foam is produced, which decreases {{the density of}} the magma, accelerating it up the conduit. <b>Fragmentation</b> occurs when bubbles occupy ~70-80 vol% of the erupting mixture. When <b>fragmentation</b> occurs, violently expanding bubbles tear the magma apart into fragments which are ejected into the atmosphere where they solidify into ash particles. <b>Fragmentation</b> is a very efficient process of ash formation and is capable of generating very fine ash even without the addition of water.|$|E

40|$|Since 1964 {{at least}} 56 {{spacecraft}} and two launch vehicle upper stages have been deliberately fragmented while in Earth orbit. Many {{of these events}} have had no long-lasting effects on the near-Earth space environment, but one represents the most devastating satellite breakup in history that will pose hazards to operational spacecraft in low Earth orbit for decades to come. International space debris mitigation guidelines now call for avoiding the creation of long-lived debris from intentional satellite <b>fragmentations.</b> This paper summarizes the reasons for and environmental consequences of deliberate satellite <b>fragmentations.</b> Contrary to popular belief, only one in five deliberate <b>fragmentations</b> have been related to the testing of anti-satellite weapon systems, for which only one such test has occurred during the past 25 years. Other reasons for deliberate satellite <b>fragmentations</b> range from engineering tests to protecting national security information. Whereas the majority of deliberate satellite <b>fragmentations</b> have occurred in low Earth orbits, some have involved spacecraft in highly elliptical orbits. The former Soviet Union and the current Russian Federation {{have been responsible for}} 90 % of all identified deliberate on-orbit satellite <b>fragmentations...</b>|$|R

5|$|Volcanic ash is also {{produced}} during phreatomagmatic eruptions. During these eruptions <b>fragmentation</b> occurs when magma comes {{into contact with}} bodies of water (such as the sea, lakes and marshes) groundwater, snow or ice. As the magma, which is significantly hotter than the boiling point of water, comes into contact with water an insulating vapor film forms (Leidenfrost effect). Eventually this vapor film will collapse leading to direct coupling of the cold water and hot magma. This increases the heat transfer {{which leads to the}} rapid expansion of water and <b>fragmentation</b> of the magma into small particles which are subsequently ejected from the volcanic vent. <b>Fragmentation</b> causes an increase in contact area between magma and water creating a feedback mechanism, leading to further <b>fragmentation</b> and production of fine ash particles.|$|E

40|$|Analysis of holocentric mitotic {{metaphase}} chromosomes of the peach-potato aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer) clone 33 H revealed different chromosome numbers, ranging from 12 to 17 within each embryo, {{in contrast to}} the standard karyotype of this species (2 n= 12). Chromosome length measurements revealed that the observed chromosomal mosaicism is due to recurrent <b>fragmentations</b> of chromosomes X, 1 and 3 due to fragile sites or to hot spots of recombination. Fluorescent in situ hybridization experiments showed that X chromosomes were frequently involved in recurrent <b>fragmentations,</b> in particular their telomeric end opposite to the nucleolar organizer region (NORs). Experiments to induce males showed that M. persicae clone 33 H is obligately parthenogenetic. The reproduction by apomictic parthenogenesis, together with a high telomerase expression that stabilized the chromosomes involved in the <b>fragmentations</b> observed in the M. persicae clone 33 H, appears to favour the stabilization of the observed chromosome instability...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis work {{presents}} two liquid chromatography/tandem {{mass spectrometry}} (LC/MS/MS) acquisition modes: multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) and neutral loss scan (NL), {{for the analysis}} of 28 compounds in a mixture. This mixture includes 21 compounds related to the metabolism of three amino acids: tyrosine, tryptophan and glutamic acid, two pterins and five deuterated compounds used as internal standards. The identification of compounds is achieved using the retention times (RT) and the characteristic <b>fragmentations</b> of ionized compounds. The acquisition modes used for the detection of characteristic ions turned out to be complementary: the identification of expected compounds only is feasible by MRM while expected and unexpected compounds are detected by NL. In {{the first part of this}} work, the <b>fragmentations</b> characterizing each molecule of interest are described. These <b>fragmentations</b> are used in the second part for the detection by MRM and NL of selected compounds in mixture with and without biological fluids.

40|$|AbstractA {{variety of}} backbone-modified {{peptides}} were desorbed by {{fast atom bombardment}} and collisionally activated. These peptide modifications involve the replacement of a normal [CONH] peptide linkage with such groups as thiomethylene ether (CH 2 S), thioamide (CSNH), methyleneamine (CH 2 NH), and thiomethylene sulfoxide (CH 2 SO) moieties. Modified linear peptides decompose to give <b>fragmentations</b> characteristic of the modifications as well as typical peptide bond fragments. The presence of a replacement group in cyclic peptides can induce new <b>fragmentations.</b> The presence of other functional groups, such as exocyclic N-terminal residue, however, can dominate the observed <b>fragmentations.</b> Upon collisional activation, unmodified linear peptides fragment to give N-terminal ions as the most abundant daughter ions. In comparison, ψ[CH 2 NH] and ψ[CH 2 S] modified linear peptides decompose to give prominent C-terminal sequence ions. The ψ[CH 2 SO] modified linear peptides, however, fragment in both N- and C-terminal ions of high relative abudance. Depending on the modification, daughter ions or internal fragment ions are observed that are characteristic of the amide bond replacement. Useful structural information can therefore be obtained...|$|R
