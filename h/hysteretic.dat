25|$|Viscous Dampers {{have the}} benefit of being a {{supplemental}} damping system. They have an oval <b>hysteretic</b> loop and the damping is velocity dependent. While some minor maintenance is potentially required, viscous dampers generally {{do not need to be}} replaced after an earthquake. While more expensive than other damping technologies they can be used for both seismic and wind loads and are the most commonly used hysteric damper.|$|E
25|$|A {{comparator}} {{can be used}} {{to build}} a relaxation oscillator. It uses both positive and negative feedback. The positive feedback is a Schmitt trigger configuration. Alone, the trigger is a bistable multivibrator. However, the slow negative feedback added to the trigger by the RC circuit causes the circuit to oscillate automatically. That is, the addition of the RC circuit turns the <b>hysteretic</b> bistable multivibrator into an astable multivibrator.|$|E
25|$|However, early MEMS {{resonators}} did {{not have}} sufficiently stable frequencies {{to be used for}} timing references or clock generation. The metallic resonator elements tended to shift frequency with time (they aged) and with use (they fatigued). Under temperature variation they tended to have large and not entirely predicable frequency shifts (they had large temperature sensitivity) and when they were temperature cycled they tended to return to different frequencies (they were <b>hysteretic).</b>|$|E
25|$|Resistance {{thermometers}} and thermistors {{are generally}} used in two ways. First, {{they can be}} used as thermometers: By measuring the resistance, the temperature of the environment can be inferred. Second, {{they can be used}} in conjunction with Joule heating (also called self-heating): If a large current is running through the resistor, the resistor's temperature rises and therefore its resistance changes. Therefore, these components {{can be used in a}} circuit-protection role similar to fuses, or for feedback in circuits, or for many other purposes. In general, self-heating can turn a resistor into a nonlinear and <b>hysteretic</b> circuit element. For more details see Thermistor#Self-heating effects.|$|E
25|$|Friction dampers {{tend to be}} {{available}} in two major types, linear and rotational and dissipate energy by heat. The damper operates {{on the principle of}} a coulomb damper. Depending on the design, friction dampers can experience stick-slip phenomenon and Cold welding. The main disadvantage being that friction surfaces can wear over time and for this reason they are not recommended for dissipating wind loads. When used in seismic applications wear is not a problem and there is no required maintenance. They have a rectangular <b>hysteretic</b> loop {{and as long as the}} building is sufficiently elastic they tend to settle back to their original positions after an earthquake.|$|E
500|$|To {{support the}} 60 story condo tower, One Rincon Hill South Tower has a massive [...] thick pile-raft {{foundation}} embedded deep into serpentine rock. Although some engineers view serpentine rock with suspicion, there are massive structures, {{such as the}} Golden Gate Bridge, that have foundations on rock that is largely serpentine. Rising out of the foundation are the concrete core and large, tall columns of steel-reinforced concrete called outriggers. The core {{is attached to the}} outrigger columns by diagonal, steel buckling-restrained braces which are designed to dissipate energy during an earthquake through controlled <b>hysteretic</b> behavior. This type of advanced seismic system performs {{in a manner similar to}} that of shock absorbers. The braces are also encased in concrete and steel to further mitigate risk of buckling and strength loss. Also of note is the controlled-rocking system which features vertical post-tensioning which runs the height of the building through ducts within the reinforced-concrete shear-wall core. Many of these technologies used in the One Rincon Hill South Tower have never before been applied in the United States.|$|E

As for bandwidth limitations, the dynamic response of an SMA actuator during <b>hysteretic</b> phase transformations is very slow due to the amount of time required for the heat to transfer to the SMA artificial muscle. Very little research has been conducted regarding SMA control due to assumptions that regard SMA applications as static devices; nevertheless, a variety of control approaches have been tested to address the control problem of <b>hysteretic</b> nonlinearity.|$|E

50|$|Combined saddle node bifurcations in {{a system}} can {{generate}} multistability.

50|$|CDK1, in turn, phosphorylates and modulates the {{activity}} of Wee1 and the Cdc25 isoforms A and C. Specifically, CDK1 phosphorylation inhibits Wee1 kinase activity, activates Cdc25C phosphatase activity, and stabilizes Cdc25A. Thus, CDK1 forms a positive feedback loop with Cdc25 and a double negative feedback loop with Wee1 (essentially a net positive feedback loop). These loops encode a <b>hysteretic</b> bistable switch in CDK1 activity relative to cyclin B1 levels. It is thought that this <b>hysteretic</b> behavior ensures that cells commit to mitosis even if cyclin B1 levels falter.|$|E

50|$|Tensiometers are {{directly}} influenced by {{this type of}} hysteresis. Two other types of sensors used to measure soil water matric potential are also influenced by hysteresis effects within the sensor itself. Resistance blocks, both nylon and gypsum based, measure matric potential {{as a function of}} electrical resistance. The relation between the sensor’s electrical resistance and sensor matric potential is <b>hysteretic.</b> Thermocouples measure matric potential as a function of heat dissipation. Hysteresis occurs because measured heat dissipation depends on sensor water content, and the sensor water content-matric potential relationship is <b>hysteretic.</b> , only desorption curves are usually measured during calibration of soil moisture sensors. Despite the fact that it can be a source of significant error, the sensor specific effect of hysteresis is generally ignored.|$|E
