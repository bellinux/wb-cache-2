40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{initially}} identify, at an exploratory level, an immigration model in Romania, with a special focus on economic immigration. It is well known that Romania, although source country, on our continent (Spain, Italy, Belgium, France etc.), as well as on the American (Canada, U. S. A) or the Australian one, with a negative migratory balance rate, after joining the European Union, it will become in the near future a destination country, especially for „economic immigrants”. The natural population deficit with which Romania is currently confronted, the labour market imbalances (the low level of participation of the current population in the productive process and the high number of Romanians working abroad) and the experience of older European Union members support the idea. As such, the analysis of social and economical risks that rising immigration will bring on the Romanian society is rather interesting and the applicative uses reside in identifying risk management solutions, in the context of formulating specific policies for <b>immigration</b> <b>management.</b> immigration, foreign labour force, Romania, European Union...|$|E

40|$|Italy and Greece {{have been}} often blamed by their fellow EU Member States for the {{excessive}} permeability of their borders, {{their inability to}} stop irregular migration, and their inefficient asylum systems. In addition the two countries have weak internal controls, especially as regards the sectors of the labour market where immigrants are usually employed e. g. agriculture, domestic work, tourism and catering. This article seeks {{to make sense of}} these fundamentally contradictory policies that characterise Greece’s and Italy’s approach to managing migration. The article starts by outlining the common features of Italian and Greek immigration policies and proposes an analysis of immigration control regimes along two dimensions: their internal (within the country’s territory) or external (at the border or outside the border) character, and their fencing (stopping) vs. gate-keeping (preventing) nature. Section 3 discusses critically the irregular migration inflows in Greece, the policies implemented to address them and their contradictory results. Section 4 reviews the related policies in Italy and casts light to their inconsistencies. In the concluding section, we highlight the possible explanations for these two countries’ lack of direction in <b>immigration</b> <b>management</b> pointing to the opposition between excessively regulated labour markets, large informal economies and strict border controls which however become lax and ineffective once irregular migrants or asylum seekers are within the country...|$|E
30|$|The {{topic of}} <b>immigration</b> <b>management</b> in Europe (and Italy) is {{virtually}} absent in the literature, also {{due to the}} novelty of the recent and massive immigration flows towards the European Union. Relying on all the premises expressed above, {{the aim of this}} paper is to contribute to the literature by building a theoretical dynamic model addressing the recurrent issue of overcongestion afflicting the immigration hosting facilities of an increasing number of Italian municipalities. In this framework, a municipal authority faces a trade-off between increasing the number of immigrants into its urban jurisdiction (which generates revenues) and optimal congestion level. Additionally, it is rational to assume that a municipal authority can utilize a share of the revenues to amplify the capacity of its hosting facilities, in this way decreasing the congestion level. As stressed, municipalities, in modifying the rate of change of immigration flows, must further take into account the level of rigidities exercised by both local residents and firms, who hence affect the process of policy implementation. Increasing the rate of immigrant arrivals might please firms and contribute to raise the municipal revenues, but at the same time, it can lead to situations of overcongestion and higher protests by local residents. Conversely, decreasing the same rate alleviates the issue of overcongestion and might please local residents but can be detrimental for firms and lead to a lower revenue receipt. From the model, two important findings emerge; firstly, at the steady-state level, the municipality always experiences a level of overcongestion (with respect to the optimal congestion level). Secondly, the different magnitude of the impact exercised by the level of rigidities can lead to different dynamic paths of convergence towards the steady state, namely monotonic or oscillatory. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces and solves the model. Section 3 concludes.|$|E
40|$|How can one {{detect and}} {{understand}} {{change in the}} face of apparent continuity? This is the question which has been asked by some scholars of institutionalism. One way of answering this is to make analytical room for incremental change as an endogenous source of institutional transformation. Put bluntly, one does not always need spectacular exogenous events, such as wars and revolutions, to explain institutional change. The present thesis is a qualitative case study of Japan’s immigration policy towards economic migrants since the 1980 s. Its aim is to uncover a causal mechanism behind the policy development by drawing on a model of institutional change put forward by James Mahoney, Wolfgang Streeck and Kathleen Thelen. At first, the inquiry may seem ill-founded for Japan is neither an immigration country nor an immigrant-receiving country. Indeed, the country still lacks an immigration policy to speak of, and immigrants continue to be called gaikokujin (foreigners) as opposed to imin (immigrants). A closer examination of the recent policy development, however, shows that the content and practice of Japanese immigration policy simply belie its self-description. Since 2012 the Japanese government has admitted highly-skilled migrants as potential permanent residents using a points-based system and has incorporated foreigners into the resident register system for Japanese citizens in order to facilitate their integration into Japanese society. The central claim of the present research is that Japanese immigration policy has become increasingly settlement-oriented as an unexpected consequence of earlier policy decisions and that the change has been endogenously effected without dismantling the pre-existing institution of <b>immigration</b> <b>management.</b> In making this claim, I particularly draw attention {{to the way in which}} a cumulative effect of minor changes eventually transformed the basic nature of the policy institution.

40|$|Fingerprint {{recognition}} and biometrics in general have been significantly gaining attention {{within the last}} years, not least due to the biometric passport that has been introduced all over Europe and the American <b>immigration</b> <b>management</b> system US-VISIT. The tasks of fingerprint recognition {{can be broken down}} to smaller entities, i. e. quality assessment, pre-processing, feature extraction and alignment/matching. Techniques contributing to each of these steps are proposed. Furthermore, several (quality-adaptive) fusion schemes for the combination of multiple fingerprint recognition systems are presented. Symmetry features are employed in all image processing tasks, i. e. to model the ridge-valley pattern, the minutiae points as well as the singularities of a fingerprint. Furthermore, they allow for an efficient implementation by means of 1 D Gaussian filters. An untrained reduced reference approach for image quality assessment is proposed, which enables the localization of impurities and structural shortcomings. In addition to symmetry features, the suggested pre-processing utilizes pyramidal image processing and directional 1 D filtering to yield a high-fidelity fingerprint enhancement. The proposed local feature extraction method employs a combination of symmetry features for reliable minutiae detection. After an alignment by means of the minutiae points, a correlation-based matching strategy is suggested to establish correspondence between fingerprints. Although all suggested techniques can be perfectly employed in isolation, a combination is advisable, since it adds to their overall efficiency and practicability (e. g. joint integration in hardware). Multi-algorithm fusion within the fingerprint modality is exploited as a further resource to increase the joint recognition accuracy, also incorporating the quality of the biometric data. For this purpose we suggest a computationally efficient cascaded fusion scheme and additionally evaluate simple fusion rules and a trained Bayesian scheme. The practical value of all proposed techniques is corroborated by experiments, involving comparisons to relevant existing methods. Furthermore, the tests were performed on extensive and publicly available databases...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of migration flows {{for the last}} decades and the emphasis laid on labour force circulation shifted the interest focus from managing crises generated by conjectural migration flows to inter-country cooperation for coordinating policies regarding labour migration. migration as multinational process {{can be dealt with}} by efficient management at international, national and local level that would aim maximising the advantages of all involved actors, taking into account its fluid character and dynamics, its permanently changing features. complexity of the labour migration phenomenon and the lack of a coherent and sufficiently comprehensive data base hindered the {{development of}} some management models, and the recommendations of local/national/regional policies took into account particularities of labour market, labour force location and difficulties of covering labour force deficits, but also socio-professional particularities of potential migrants, as well. force migration management gains importance also from the perspective of increased demographic aging both in EU developed countries and in the new member-states where the aging dynamic on labour market is marked also by the labour mobility to western and northern European countries. paper intends to present the main milestones defining migration management, and the policies in the field.

40|$|This book {{chapter is}} in closed access. Anarchism is {{strongly}} opposed to racism and bigotry, and celebrates cultural pluralism and the endless {{diversity of the}} human race. At the same time, anarchists are very critical of modern “multiculturalism” as a state-driven population and <b>immigration</b> <b>management</b> agenda. The chapter examines this critique, while offering an account of original anarchist approaches to identity and community conceived on an ethno-cultural basis. The anarchist critique of multiculturalism has several dimensions, including its continued reliance on the state, and its obviation of social antagonism in favour of competing demands for status and resources within existing arrangements of power. On this reading, multiculturalism dissolves the potential for solidarities that would challenge the given society by redefining which identities enjoy first-order relevance (namely, ethnic or religious ones) and allowing the state, and its technocratic machinations of coercive urban governance, to engage with groups (or their declared leaders) on that basis. In addition, anarchists have criticised multiculturalism as a privileged liberal ideology that pushed sections of the white working class population “left behind” by neoliberal globalisation {{into the hands of}} the far right. At the same time, anarchists celebrate the grassroots, quotidian, non-state-sanctioned forms of “multiculturalism” that people arguably practice on a daily basis – trying to get along with people from other backgrounds and avoiding cultural imposition. These have a long history in the Left, although under other names ("working class internationalism", "transnational solidarity", “cosmopolitanism” etc.). A fair amount of “classical" anarchist writing thus engaged with topics akin to multiculturalism, albeit in terms of "nations," "nationalities," or "peoples. " The chapter surveys some of these, from Bakunin’s writings on the rights of "nationalities" to exist and exercise their independence, through Kropotkin’s discussions of national liberation, and on to Rocker’s wide-ranging considerations on state-driven identity in Nationalism and Culture. Many anarchists wrote positively of non-Western cultures and their equality, especially Elisee Reclus, Peter Kropotkin and Jean Grave. These anarchist notions of cultural pluralism engage explicitly with class conflict in a way that contemporary liberal conceptions of multiculturalism do not. Finally, the chapter looks at anarchist responses to contemporary cultural pluralism. The chief argument here is that rather than seeking a blueprint for social relations among diverse groups in the absence of the state, anarchist theory should focus on present-tense questions relevant to its emergent strategic outlooks on social transformation, asking how encounters in mixed communities impact on political-cultural dynamics and how anarchists can use grassroots forms of encounter to push forward radical agendas. Here, the main issue remains the politics of solidarity across difference and asymmetric power. Dilemmas surrounding this issue are explored in two key contexts: settler-colonial societies and societies absorbing immigration...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{immigration}} reform {{efforts have been}} ineffective at controlling the flow of illegal immigration. Concurrently, a structural change occured in the agricultural sector as farm labor contractor (FLC) usage expanded. The FLC sector is, arguably, evolving due to the tighter regulatory and risk environment faced by producers. Using probit analysis of survey data from California growers, this study analyzes labor contracting patterns. Differences are found among regions, commodities, and several grower characteristics. However, the significant role of risk perceptions and management attitudes are of greatest interest given the absence of labor issues in agricultural risk management programs. Key words: farm labor, contracts, <b>immigration,</b> risk <b>management.</b> The <b>Immigration</b> Reform and Control Act of 1986 (lRCA) has influenced everyone involved in the farm labor market (Taylor and Thilmany, Goodwin, Polopolus and Emerson). Changes were expected in the farm labor market as a re-sult of IRCA, including an immediate supply of new low-skilled immigrants (given amnesty un-der IRCA), and, eventually, a low-skill labor shortage when these immigrants gained {{the skills necessary to}} advance to better jobs. In-stead, various factors led to a restructuring of the farm labor market with respect to labor management rather than workers, as demon-strated by the notable increase in farm labor contractor (FLC) usage in California during the past decade (see figure 1, table 1). Although the increased use of FLC services in the farm labor market has been noted (Taylor and Thilmany, CEDD), the reasons for their increased use is not fully understood. The proliferation of FLCs may be partially due to the new risks and costs to employers of hiring illegal workers under IRCA. Before IRCA, unauthorized immigrants only cost em...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} the temporal, spatial, and demographic factors that influenced roadway mortality of barn owls (Tyto alba) along a 248 -km stretch of Interstate 84 in southern Idaho using systematic road surveys. Counts of dead animals from surveys can be underestimated because of sampling biases; therefore, we also conducted experiments {{to assess the}} effects of search and removal bias on the estimates of roadway mortality of owls. We conducted surveys every 2 weeks over a 2 -year period and detected 812 dead barn owls (unadjusted mortality rate of 1. 64 [*]owls/km/yr). After adjusting this estimate for search and removal bias, we documented mortality rates of up to 5. 99 [*]owls/km/year. Owl mortality was not random in relation to sex, age class, or location along the highway. Females and juveniles, which represent individuals more likely to disperse long distances, were killed more frequently than males and adults. During the nonbreeding season, owls were killed more often near agricultural lands than in shrub-steppe, but this pattern was not apparent during the breeding season. Owls were also killed more often on portions of the roadway closer to the Snake River canyon, {{perhaps because of the}} availability of nest and roost sites. Mortality rates differed markedly between the 2 years of study, which could have been related to variability in weather and its subsequent effect on owl productivity. Our data suggest that barn owls in this region may not persist under this level of mortality without significant <b>immigration</b> or <b>management.</b> Thus, roadway management to reduce or prevent owl use of roadways, reduce rodent populations near major roads, alert motorists to the presence of owls, or otherwise reduce the chances that vehicles and owls collide would improve barn owl survival and population persistence...|$|R
40|$|Japan is ageing, and its {{population}} is declining. Given the potential detrimental {{economic and social}} consequences brought about by this sort of demographic change, {{it has been suggested}} that the Japanese could benefit from the implementation of more liberal (im) migration policies. This thesis studies the demographic change – immigration policy development nexus from the perspective of the state in the context of Japan and assesses the role that immigration plays within the larger population debate. A constructivist grounded theory methodology is utilised to analyse primary and secondary qualitative data. Additionally, two theoretical approaches of political demography (Robbins and Smith, 2016) and policy mobilities paradigm (see Baker et al. 2016) are employed in order to explore how demographic change may be informing immigration policy design and how Japan might be interacting with other nations and international organizations in such process. The thesis concludes with the observation that the immigration option has not been prioritized to address the various challenges that have been brought about by population decline and ageing. The available evidence gathered for this project also indicates that the latest amendments to the law – which are more liberal in nature – do not consider immigration to be a replacement for the loss in population. These amendments do, however, facilitate the mobility of foreign human resources with a view to partially alleviating specific labour shortages and having newcomers contribute to economic growth while, at the same time, respecting the current ‘façade’ regarding immigration control policies as well as the country’s nationhood regulatory principle. As such, this work makes the case that Japan’s strategy regarding immigration policy change is that of ‘highly selective, cautious, progressive incrementalism’. This thesis also suggests that Japanese policy-makers closely examine other countries’ systems and keep track of the latest trends regarding <b>immigration</b> control <b>management</b> but remain reticent to actively engage with other nations and international organizations in the design of the legislation...|$|R
