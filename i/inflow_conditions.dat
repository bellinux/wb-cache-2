40|$|An ongoing {{challenge}} in broadening {{the adoption of}} the large-eddy simulation (LES) technique to practical engineering flows is the need to generate turbulent <b>inflow</b> <b>conditions</b> that can trigger and sustain the expected energy cascade of turbulence in the flow domain. Several methods for generating realistic turbulent <b>inflow</b> <b>conditions</b> have been proposed, each with strengths and weaknesses, yet the topic of turbulent inflow boundary conditions remains an active research area. We investigate the method of buoyancy perturbations by Muñoz-Esparza et al. 1, 2 for the turbulent channel flow case, and extend it to better simulate the expected first and second order turbulence statistics. Our results show that buoyancy perturbations can be practical for generating turbulent <b>inflow</b> <b>conditions,</b> but turbulence statistics are dependent on the specifics of the implementation...|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} the results from a set of incompressible, shear-layer flow experiments, at high Reynolds number (Re U T (x) = ’ 2 105), in which the <b>inflow</b> <b>conditions</b> of shear-layer {{formation}} were varied (T is the temperature-rise thickness for chemically-reacting shear layers). Both inert and chemically-reacting flows were investigated, the latter employing the (H 2 +NO) =F 2 chemical system in the kinetically-fast regime to measure molecular mixing. <b>Inflow</b> <b>conditions</b> were varied by perturbing each, or both, boundary layers on the splitter plate separating the two freestream flows, upstream of shear-layer formation. The results of the chemically-reacting ‘flip experiments ’ reveal that seemingly small changes in <b>inflow</b> <b>conditions</b> can have a signi cant influence {{not only on the}} large-scale structure and shear-layer growth rate, as had been documented previously, but also on molecular mixing and chemical-product formation, far downstream of the inflow region. 1...|$|E
40|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{associate}} intracranial aneurysmal hemodynamics with aneurysm growth and rupture status. Hemodynamics in aneurysms is traditionally determined with computational fluid dynamics by using generalized <b>inflow</b> boundary <b>conditions</b> in a parent artery. Recently, patient-specific <b>inflow</b> boundary <b>conditions</b> are being implemented more frequently. Our purpose was to compare intracranial aneurysm hemodynamics based on generalized versus patient-specific <b>inflow</b> boundary <b>conditions.</b> For 36 patients, geometric models of aneurysms were determined by using 3 D rotational angiography. 2 D phase-contrast MR imaging velocity measurements of the parent artery were performed. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed twice: once by using patient-specific phase-contrast MR imaging velocity profiles and once by using generalized Womersley profiles as <b>inflow</b> boundary <b>conditions.</b> Resulting mean and maximum wall shear stress and oscillatory shear index values were analyzed, and hemodynamic characteristics were qualitatively compared. Quantitative analysis showed statistically significant differences for mean and maximum wall shear stress values between both <b>inflow</b> boundary <b>conditions</b> (P <. 001). Qualitative assessment of hemodynamic characteristics showed differences in 21 cases: high wall shear stress location (n = 8), deflection location (n = 3), lobulation wall shear stress (n = 12), and/or vortex and inflow jet stability (n = 9). The latter showed more instability for the generalized <b>inflow</b> boundary <b>conditions</b> in 7 of 9 patients. Using generalized and patient-specific <b>inflow</b> boundary <b>conditions</b> for computational fluid dynamics results in different wall shear stress magnitudes and hemodynamic characteristics. Generalized <b>inflow</b> boundary <b>conditions</b> result in more vortices and inflow jet instabilities. This study emphasizes the necessity of patient-specific <b>inflow</b> boundary <b>conditions</b> for calculation of hemodynamics in cerebral aneurysms by using computational fluid dynamics technique...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the inlet and outlet angles of the centrifugal fan without scroll casing were investigated in relating to the characteristics of aerodynamics and noise. The following results are obtained. The inlet angle of the impeller, which is estimated by the radial <b>inflow</b> <b>condition,</b> gives the extremely low angle for the <b>inflow</b> <b>condition.</b> The cause is that the leakage flow from the clearance between the front shroud and the bell mouth is very large and has the tangential component of velocity. And we proposed the new charts of the performance on the fan noise. They clearly indicate {{the effect of the}} inlet and outlet angles of the impeller to the performance of the fan noise. From the charts, the optimal design parameters and the sensitivity of them to the fan noise can be easily obtained...|$|R

Because the method {{can be used for}} a flow field with both subsonic and supersonic regions, it is applicable to subcritical as well as supercritical inlet operation. Results are presented and discussed for an inlet of current design practice. Results include inviscid calculations performed for supercritical inlet operation with uniform and nonuniform <b>inflow</b> boundary <b>conditions</b> as well as for subcritical inlet operation with uniform <b>inflow</b> boundary <b>conditions.</b> Results for viscous calculations performed for supercritical inlet operation with uniform <b>inflow</b> boundary <b>conditions</b> are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of local {{turbulence}} Reynolds number R⋋ and <b>inflow</b> <b>conditions</b> on the magnitude of vorticity in plane turbulent wakes. Measurements of the spanwise component (ω₃) of the fluctuating vorticity vector ω = ω₁i + ω₂j + ω₃k (here the subscripts 1, 2 and 3 denote the streamwise, lateral and spanwise directions, respectively) are made in turbulent wakes of a screen and a circular cylinder. Lateral distributions of ω*₃ (normalized) in general depend on both R⋋ and <b>inflow</b> <b>conditions.</b> In the developing region, as the downstream distance x₁ increases, ω*₃ increases significantly in the screen wake but decreases slightly in the cylinder wake. Far downstream in the self-preserving region, ω*₃ increases linearly with R⋋ while it no longer varies with x₁ and depends weakly on the influence of <b>inflow</b> <b>conditions.</b> Our analysis suggests that these findings from the measurement of ω*₃ should apply for the magnitude of ω...|$|E

This study aims to investigate how the different <b>inflow</b> <b>conditions</b> that are usually adopted to simulate urban wind flows may affect {{the accuracy of the}} results. CFD simulations were performed on a selected urban area - “Quartiere La Venezia” in Livorno (Italy) - using a steady-state RANS approach. Two types of inflow profiles were considered for one wind direction (α = 240 ° from the North). Wind tunnel tests performed on the same urban model were used as a benchmark to validate the numerical simulations. Mean wind profiles at 25 locations were compared and the statistical performance in terms of four different metrics was quantified for both <b>inflow</b> <b>conditions.</b> The results show that slightly different <b>inflow</b> <b>conditions</b> can greatly affect the results in terms of mean wind speed and turbulent kinetic energy...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} enable {{simulations}} of developing wind turbine array boundary layers with highly realistic <b>inflow</b> <b>conditions</b> a concurrent precursor method for Large Eddy Simulations is proposed. In this method we consider two domains simultaneously, i. e. in one domain a turbulent Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) without wind turbines is simulated {{in order to}} generate the turbulent <b>inflow</b> <b>conditions</b> for a second domain in which the wind turbines are placed. The benefit {{of this approach is}} that a) it avoids the need for large databases in which the turbulent <b>inflow</b> <b>conditions</b> are stored and the correspondingly slow I/O operations and b) we are sure that the simulations are not negatively affected by statically swept fixed inflow fields or synthetic fields lacking the proper ABL coherent structures. Sample applications are presented, in which, in agreement with field data a strong decrease of the power output of downstream wind-turbines with respect to the first row of wind-turbines is observed for perfectly aligned inflow.

40|$|Complaints of many {{indoor air}} quality {{problems}} occur in partitioned offices. Ventilation {{is one way to}} control the contaminant distribution and to provide better {{indoor air quality}} within the office. A comprehensive research of the ventilation impact on indoor air quality problems in partitioned offices was conducted in this thesis. Experimental measurement and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation methods were applied. The study results show that, the supplied air was uniformly distributed in the ventilated area under various conditions. At the same time, the contaminant distribution was influenced by almost all kinds of parameters in the office. It was the room air flow pattern but not the uniformity of the supplied air distribution which influenced the contaminant distribution in the office. The results also indicate that the contaminant distribution in a mechanically ventilated partitioned office need to be studied individually according to the different cases. CFD simulation is an efficient tool for such kind of studies. The air <b>inflow</b> <b>condition</b> {{is one of the most}} important parameters affecting the air flow pattern and contaminant distribution in a mechanically ventilated room. Because of the complex geometry of the supply air diffuser and computer capacity, the conventional method of describing the supply air diffuser boundary conditions in CFD simulation may not well define the air <b>inflow</b> <b>condition.</b> The inaccurate description to the air <b>inflow</b> <b>condition</b> could lead to a totally unrealistic simulation result of the air flow inside the office. A new method to correctly describe the diffuser boundary conditions in CFD simulation was proposed in this thesis. The model prediction was validated with the experimental data in a literature and the results from the experimental part of this thesis. The CFD predictions applying the new method were in good agreement with the experimental results...|$|R

40|$|We have {{performed}} large-eddy simulation with subgrid scale (LES-SGS) stretched-vortex model of an inclined sonic jet into a supersonic crossflow at Mach 3. 6. The main flow features {{generated by the}} gas-dynamic interactions of the jet with the supersonic crossflow, such as barrel shock, shear layer, and counter-rotating vortex pair, are numerically captured by the employed LES-SGS. The transition and spatial development of the jet into a supersonic crossflow {{have been shown to}} be strongly dependent on the <b>inflow</b> <b>conditions</b> of the crossflow. This result indicates that correct turbulent <b>inflow</b> <b>conditions</b> are necessary to predict the main flow characteristics, dispersion and mixing of a gaseous jet in a supersonic, turbulent crossflow using LES-SGS. This work presents a methodology for the generation of realistic synthetic turbulent <b>inflow</b> <b>conditions</b> for LES of spatially developing, supersonic, turbulent, wall-bounded flows. The methodology is applied to the study of a supersonic turbulent flow over a flat wall interacting with an inclined jet. The effects of <b>inflow</b> <b>conditions</b> on the spatial development of the inclined jet are discussed, and then the results are compared with the available experimental data. Also, the dominant vortical structures generated by the jet/turbulent boundary layer interaction are identified as sheets, tilted tubes and discontinuous rings, and a visualization of their spatiotemporal development is provided. The identified vortical structures are shown to be enveloped by the helium mass-fraction isosurface, thus showing the important role of those structures in the dispersion of a gaseous jet in a supersonic crossflow...|$|E

It is found that the <b>inflow</b> <b>conditions</b> give significant influences to the ring-like vortex structure including the ring-like vortex shapes, vorticity origins, momentum deficit zones, streamwise velocity profiles after MVG, vortex organizations, and, more important, the interaction between vortex rings and shocks which control the boundary layer separation. 1...|$|E

40|$|When a turbine is optimized, {{it is done}} {{within the}} design {{constraints}} established by the objective criteria in the international design standards used to certify a design. Since these criteria are multifaceted, it is a challenging task to conduct the optimization, {{but it can be}} done. The optimization is facilitated by the fact that a standard turbine model is subjected to standard <b>inflow</b> <b>conditions</b> that are well characterized in the standard. Examples of applying these conditions to rotor optimization are examined. In other cases, an innovation may provide substantial improvement in one area, but be challenged to impact all of the myriad design load cases. When a turbine is placed in a wind plant, the challenge is magnified. Typical design practice optimizes the turbine for stand-alone operation, and then runs a check on the actual site conditions, including wakes from all nearby turbines. Thus, each turbine in a plant has unique <b>inflow</b> <b>conditions.</b> The possibility of creating objective and consistent <b>inflow</b> <b>conditions</b> for turbines within a plant, for used in optimization of the turbine and the plant, are examined with examples taken from LES simulation...|$|E

The measurements were performed with three lidars scanning on a vertical plane downwind of the fence. <b>Inflow</b> <b>conditions</b> {{are based on}} sonic anemometer observations of a nearby mast. For fence-undisturbed conditions, the lidars' measurements agree well with those from the sonic anemometers and, at the mast position, the average <b>inflow</b> <b>conditions</b> are well described by the logarithmic profile. Seven cases are defined based on the relative wind direction to the fence, the fence porosity, and the <b>inflow</b> <b>conditions.</b> The larger the relative direction, the lower {{the effect of the}} shelter.

The shelter is highest below [*]≈  1. 46 fence heights and can sometimes be observed at all downwind positions (up to 11 fence heights downwind). Below the fence height, the porous fence has a lower impact on the flow close to the fence compared to the solid fence.
