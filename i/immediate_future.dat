5|$|The {{accession}} of Frederick, a {{child who}} would then become also the Holy Roman Emperor FrederickII in 1197, greatly affected the <b>immediate</b> <b>future</b> of Sicily. For a land so used to centralised royal authority, the king's young age caused a serious power vacuum. His uncle Philip of Swabia moved to secure Frederick's inheritance by appointing Markward von Anweiler, margrave of Ancona, regent in 1198. Meanwhile, Pope InnocentIII had reasserted papal authority in Sicily, but recognised Frederick's rights. The pope was to see papal power decrease steadily {{over the next decade}} and was unsure about which side to back at many junctures.|$|E
5|$|In December 1997, Suharto for {{the first}} time did not attend an ASEAN presidents' summit, which was later {{revealed}} to be due to a minor stroke, creating speculation about his health and the <b>immediate</b> <b>future</b> of his presidency. In mid-December, as the crisis swept through Indonesia and an estimated $150 billion of capital was being withdrawn from the country, he appeared at a press conference to re-assert his authority and to urge people to trust the government and the collapsing Rupiah. However, his attempts to re-instill confidence had little effect. Evidence suggested that his family and associates were being spared the toughest requirements of the IMF reform process, further undermining confidence in the economy and his leadership.|$|E
5|$|Such a {{supernova}} event may pose some threat {{to life on}} the Earth. It is thought that the primary star, IK Pegasi A, is unlikely to evolve into a red giant in the <b>immediate</b> <b>future.</b> As shown previously, the space velocity of this star relative to the Sun is 20.4km/s. This is equivalent to moving a distance of one light year every 14,700years. After 5million years, for example, this star will {{be separated from the}} Sun by more than 500light years. A TypeI{{a supernova}} within a thousand parsecs (3300light-years) is thought to be able to affect the Earth, but it must be closer than about 10 parsecs (around thirty light-years) to cause a major harm to the terrestrial biosphere.|$|E
40|$|Eating {{and exercising}} {{behaviour}} are both characterized by <b>immediate</b> and <b>future</b> consequences. Consequently, consideration of these consequences (i. e. time orientation) predicts eating and exercising behaviour. We investigate whether construal level {{acts as an}} underlying mechanism of these relations. Students (N= 101) completed measures of consideration of <b>immediate</b> and <b>future</b> consequences (i. e. CFC-food and CFC-exercise), construal level, eating and exercising behaviour and preferences. For self-reported eating and exercising behaviour, only direct effects of consideration of <b>immediate</b> and <b>future</b> consequences were found. For eating preferences, however, there was evidence of an indirect effect through construal level. A stronger tendency to consider future consequences led to a stronger preference for utilitarian (as compared with hedonic) food products through a more abstract construal level. All in all, construal level partially explains the differential relations between consideration of <b>immediate</b> and <b>future</b> consequences and eating and exercising behaviour and preferences. </p...|$|R

25|$|Although many {{speakers}} of Shilha are bilingual in Moroccan Arabic, {{there are as}} yet no indications that the survival of Shilha as a living language will be seriously threatened in the <b>immediate</b> <b>future.</b> Because of {{the rapid growth of}} the Moroccan population over the past decades (from 12 million in 1961 to over 33 million in 2014), {{it is safe to say}} that Shilha is now spoken by more people than ever before in history.|$|E
25|$|According to Walter Cronkite, Khrushchev {{would go}} on to say that this {{incident}} was the beginning of his decline in power as party chairman, perhaps because he seemed unable to negotiate the international arena and the communist hardliners at home.
