5000|$|Consumer-level flatbed photo {{scanners}} have {{a dynamic}} {{range in the}} 2.0-3.0 range, which can be inadequate for scanning all types of photographic film, as Dmax can be and often is between 3.0d and 4.0d with traditional black-and-white film. Color film compresses its 12 stops of a possible 16 stops (<b>film</b> <b>latitude)</b> into just 2.0d of space via the process of dye coupling and removal of all silver from the emulsion. Kodak Vision 3 has 18 stops. So, color negative film scans the easiest of all film types on the widest range of scanners. Because traditional black-and-white film retains the image creating silver after processing, density range can be almost twice that of color film. This makes scanning traditional black-and-white film more difficult and requires a scanner {{with at least a}} 3.6d dynamic range, but also a Dmax between 4.0d to 5.0d. High-end (photo lab) flatbed scanners can reach a dynamic range of 3.7, and Dmax around 4.0d. Dedicated film scanners [...] have a dynamic range between 3.0d-4.0d. [...] Office document scanners can have a dynamic range of less than 2.0d. Drum scanners have a dynamic range of 3.6-4.5.|$|E

50|$|In 1998, Braga {{debuted in}} a Portuguese-language short called Trampolim, and then {{returned}} to her schooling. Her big break came in 2002 when she was cast as Angélica in the critically acclaimed film City of God, for which she received a Best Supporting Actress nomination from the Cinema Brazil Grand Prize. She took more time off and attended university while appearing in a pair of well-regarded South American films—2005’s Lower City and 2006’s Only God Knows—and in the popular Brazilian television program Carandiru, Outras Historias. Braga made her English-language debut in 2006 with a starring role with Brendan Fraser, Mos Def, and Catalina Sandino Moreno in Journey to the End of Night, which premiered at the 5th Annual Tribeca Film Festival. In 2007, Braga was cast in the Will Smith blockbuster I Am Legend and the drama Crossing Over, which stars Harrison Ford, Ray Liotta, and Ashley Judd. She also appeared in the 2008 David Mamet film Redbelt alongside Chiwetel Ejiofor. Braga portrayed Beth in the science-fiction film Repo Men. She starred as Isabelle in Antal Nimrod's Predators, which was shot and produced by Troublemaker Studios and Robert Rodriguez. In 2013, Braga appeared as Frey Santiago in Neill Blomkamp's Elysium. In 2014 starred as Eva in the Brazilian crime drama film Muitos Homens Num Só, as Vania in the Brazilian jungle film El Ardor, in the Argentine Romance <b>film</b> <b>Latitudes</b> and as Alice Taylor in Kriv Stenders Action-thriller Kill Me Three Times.|$|R

50|$|Haynes' first <b>film</b> was <b>Latitude</b> Zero in 1969, {{which also}} starred Cesar Romero, Richard Jaeckel, and Joseph Cotten.

She mysteriously left the acting world in 1980 and was found in 1995 by {{director}} Quentin Tarantino and author Tom Graves. In 2015 Graves published a long profile about her titled Blonde Shadow: The Brief Career and Mysterious Disappearance of Actress Linda Haynes that is included in his anthology Louise Brooks, Frank Zappa, & Other Charmers & Dreamers.|$|R
50|$|The Dead 2: India is {{a zombie}} horror film {{released}} in 2013. It is a sequel to, and follows {{up on the}} events of The Dead (2010). The Dead 2: India was produced by Road Trip Pictures in association with <b>Latitude</b> <b>Films,</b> directed by the Ford brothers, and stars Joseph Millson, Meenu Mishra, and Anand Krishna Goyal.

50|$|Latitude is {{the degree}} by which one can over, or under expose an image, and still recover an {{acceptable}} level of quality from an exposure. Typically negative film has a better ability to record a range of brightness than slide/transparency film or digital. Digital should be considered to be the reverse of print film, with a good latitude in the shadow range, and a narrow one in the highlight area; in contrast to <b>film's</b> large highlight <b>latitude,</b> and narrow shadow <b>latitude.</b> Slide/Transparency <b>film</b> has a narrow latitude in both highlight and shadow areas, requiring greater exposure accuracy.|$|R
5|$|Principal {{photography}} commenced on August 15, 1983. All but {{two days}} of production were filmed on Paramount soundstages, by cinematographer Charles Correll. The Search for Spock {{was one of the}} first major feature films to use Eastman 5294, a color high speed negative film stock. The <b>film</b> allowed Correll <b>latitude</b> in choosing a broad range of exposure indexes. Since The Search for Spock was shot with anamorphic lenses and many theatergoers would see widescreen 70mm prints, Correll needed to produce a crisp depth of field, a difficult task on many sets. For scenes on the bridge, Correll pushed the exposure index above the Eastman recommendation to keep the image crisp at less than 50foot-candles.|$|R
40|$|The 'European Guidelines on Quality Criteria for Diagnostic Radiographic Images' do {{not address}} the choice of film {{characteristic}} (H/D) curve, which is an important parameter for the description of a radiographic screen-film system. Since {{it is not possible}} to investigate this influence by taking repeated exposures of the same patients on films with systematically varied H/D curves, patient images of lumbar spine were digitised in the current study. The image contrast was altered by digital image processing techniques, simulating images with H/D curves varying from flat over standard <b>latitude</b> to a <b>film</b> type steeper than a mammography film. The manipulated images were printed on film for evaluation. Seven European radiologists evaluated the clinical image quality of in total 224 images by analysing the fulfilment of the European Image Criteria and by visual grading analysis of the images. The results show that the local quality can be significantly improved by the application of films with a steeper film H/D curve compared to the standard <b>latitude</b> <b>film.</b> For images with an average optical density of about 1. 25, the application of the steeper film results in a reduction of patient absorbed dose by about 10 - 15 % without a loss of diagnostically relevant image information. The results also show that the patient absorbed dose reduction obtained by altering the tube voltage from 70 kV to 90 kV coincides with a loss of image information that cannot be compensated for by simply changing the shape of the H/D curve...|$|R
40|$|The "European Guidelines on Quality Criteria for Diagnostic Radiographic Images" do {{not address}} {{the choice of the}} film {{characteristic}} (H&D) curve, which is an important parameter for the description of a radiographic screen–film system. The image contrast of clinical lumbar spine and chest radiographs was altered by digital image processing techniques, simulating images with different H&D curves, both steeper and flatter than the original. The manipulated images were printed on film for evaluation. Seven experienced radiologists evaluated the clinical image quality by analysing the fulfilment of the European Image Criteria (ICS) and by visual grading analysis (VGA) of in total 224 lumbar spine and 360 chest images. A parallel study of the effect of the H&D curve has also been made using a theoretical model. The contrast ({Delta}OD) of relevant anatomical details was calculated, using a Monte Carlo simulation-model of the complete imaging system including a 3 D voxel phantom of a patient. Correlations between the calculated contrast and the radiologists' assessment by VGA were sought. The results of the radiologists' assessment show that the quality in selected regions of lumbar spine and chest images can be significantly improved by the use of films with a steeper H&D curve compared with the standard <b>latitude</b> <b>film.</b> Significant (p< 0. 05) correlations were found between the VGA results and the calculations of the contrast of transverse processes and trabecular details in the lumbar spine vertebrae, and with the contrast of blood vessels in the retrocardiac area of the chest...|$|R
