5|$|Political {{sociology}} {{has also}} moved beyond methodological nationalism and analysed {{the role of}} non-governmental organizations, the diffusion of the nation-state throughout the Earth as a social construct, {{and the role of}} stateless entities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> <b>world</b> society.

5|$|Scottish nineteenth-century Reformed theologian William Cunningham {{also sought}} to {{articulate}} a distinctively Reformed theology of baptism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> <b>world.</b> Cunningham preferred the writings of Zwingli on the sacraments, writing that Calvin and later Reformed orthodox theologians overly elevated {{the value of the}} sacraments. He argued that the efficacy of baptism only applies to adults expressing faith in the act of baptism.|$|E

5|$|Dickens was not {{the first}} author to {{celebrate}} the Christmas season in literature. Among earlier authors who influenced Dickens was Washington Irving, whose 1819–20 work The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. included four essays on old English Christmas traditions that he experienced while staying at Aston Hall near Birmingham. The tales and essays attracted Dickens, and the two authors shared the belief that the staging of a nostalgic English Christmas might help restore the social harmony that had been lost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
5|$|In The Stuff of Thought (2007), Pinker {{looks at}} {{a wide range of}} issues around the way words related to {{thoughts}} on the one hand, and to the world outside ourselves on the other.

5|$|Most reviews {{were very}} favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, {{although}} a few complained that the final chapters seemed rushed. The writing {{has been compared to}} that of Jane Austen, one of Rowling's favourite authors, Roald Dahl, whose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter, and the Ancient Greek story-teller Homer. While some commentators thought the book looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian boarding school stories, others thought it placed the genre firmly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> <b>world</b> by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues.|$|E

5|$|Muslim {{countries}} that retain or adopt Sharia usually determine which {{parts of the}} Sharia are enforceable and codify (and thereby modernize) them. Unlike other Muslim countries, Saudi Arabia regards uncodified Sharia in its entirety as {{the law of the}} land and does not interfere with it. It is, therefore, unique not only when compared to Western systems, but also in comparison to other Muslim countries, and according to one source is the closest system <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> <b>world</b> to the form of Sharia adopted at the advent of Islam.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{has been}} in use at least 10,000 years, but more than 95% of all copper ever mined and smelted has been {{extracted}} since 1900, {{and more than half}} was extracted the last 24 years. As with many natural resources, the total amount of copper on Earth is vast, with around 1014 tons in the top kilometer of Earth's crust, which is about 5 million years' worth at the current rate of extraction. However, {{only a tiny fraction of}} these reserves is economically viable with present-day prices and technologies. Estimates of copper reserves available for mining vary from 25 years to 60 years, depending on core assumptions such as the growth rate. Recycling is a major source of copper <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> <b>world.</b> Because of these and other factors, the future of copper production and supply is the subject of much debate, including the concept of peak copper, analogous to peak oil.|$|E
5|$|Despite Mihardja's {{insistence that}} Atheis {{is meant to}} be realistic, several {{symbolic}} interpretations have been put forward. According to Mihardja, {{one of the most common}} interpretations readers conveyed to him was that Hasan's death symbolised atheism defeating religion, with Hasan's death as the death of theism. According to Maier, Atheis serves as an allegory for the development of the Indonesian nation. Hasan, representing traditionalism, is killed by the Japanese, who changed the status quo when they invaded in 1942. Meanwhile, the anarchistic Anwar finds himself without a place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> <b>world.</b> Only the responsible modern character, Rusli, is able to bring the Indonesian nation, as represented by Kartini, to terms with the new world.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> <b>world,</b> dance {{has come}} to be {{regarded}} as something one does for recreation, thus distancing dance from the important place it has held in many human cultures throughout history—that is, a method of expression, preservation and transmission of the culture and history of a people. Many of the activities that humans have engaged in for millennia (religion and courtship, for example) have traditionally found expression in various kinds of dance. Another activity—combat—has obviously been central to the life of most human cultures; thus, one expects to find dances that celebrate skill in the use of weapons. Indeed, there is a wide range of such weapon dances in the world; they vary from general displays of prowess in the use of weapons to reenactments of real episodes of combat specific to a given culture.|$|E
5|$|One {{important}} source of language change is contact and resulting diffusion of linguistic traits between languages. Language contact occurs when speakers {{of two or more}} languages or varieties interact on a regular basis. Multilingualism is likely to have been the norm throughout human history and most people <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> <b>world</b> are multilingual. Before the rise of the concept of the ethno-national state, monolingualism was characteristic mainly of populations inhabiting small islands. But with the ideology that made one people, one state, and one language the most desirable political arrangement, monolingualism started to spread throughout the world. Nonetheless, there are only 250 countries in the world corresponding to some 6000 languages, which means that most countries are multilingual and most languages therefore exist in close contact with other languages.|$|E
5|$|The Principia was {{published}} on 5 July 1687 with encouragement and financial help from Edmond Halley. In this work, Newton stated the three universal laws of motion. Together, these laws describe {{the relationship between}} any object, the forces acting upon it and the resulting motion, laying the foundation for classical mechanics. They contributed to many advances during the Industrial Revolution which soon followed and were not improved upon for more than 200 years. Many of these advancements {{continue to be the}} underpinnings of non-relativistic technologies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> <b>world.</b> He used the Latin word gravitas (weight) for the effect that would become known as gravity, and defined the law of universal gravitation.|$|E

5|$|There {{are almost}} no written sources {{from which to}} re-construct the {{demography}} of early Medieval Scotland. Estimates have been made of a population of 10,000 inhabitants in Dál Riata and 80–100,000 for Pictland. It {{is likely that the}} 5th and 6th centuries saw higher mortality rates due to the appearance of bubonic plague, which may have reduced net population. The known conditions have been taken to suggest it was a high fertility, high mortality society, similar to many developing countries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> <b>world,</b> with a relatively young demographic profile, and perhaps early childbearing, and large numbers of children for women. This would have meant that there were a relatively small proportion of available workers to the number of mouths to feed. This would have made it difficult to produce a surplus that would allow demographic growth and more complex societies to develop.|$|E
5|$|Weber {{continued}} his investigation into this matter in later works, notably in his studies on bureaucracy {{and on the}} classification of legitimate authority into three types– rational-legal, traditional and charismatic– of which the rational-legal (through bureaucracy) is the dominant one <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> <b>world.</b> In these works Weber described {{what he saw as}} society's movement towards rationalisation. Similarly, rationalisation could be seen in the economy, with the development of highly rational and calculating capitalism. Weber also saw rationalisation as one of the main factors setting the European West apart {{from the rest of the}} world. Rationalisation relied on deep changes in ethics, religion, psychology and culture; changes that first took place in the Western civilisation.|$|E
5|$|The Utility of Force: The Art of War <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Modern</b> <b>World</b> is a {{treatise}} on modern warfare written by General Sir Rupert Smith {{and published in}} 2005. Smith is a retired general who spent 40 years in the British Army; he commanded the 1st Armoured Division in the First Gulf War and served as General Officer Commanding Northern Ireland {{at the end of}} the Troubles. He was motivated to write the book by his experiences in the Balkans. He commanded the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia from 1995 to 1996, during which time the Srebrenica massacre occurred and the capital, Sarajevo, was under siege by Serb forces. Smith was instrumental in the lifting of the siege by arranging for NATO air strikes and an artillery barrage. This enabled a ground assault by Bosnian and Croatian forces that ended the siege and led to the Dayton Agreement. Smith's second involvement with the Balkans was in 1999 during the Kosovo War, when he was serving as NATO's Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe, overseeing air strikes against Serb targets.|$|E
