She specialized {{in the fields of}} toxicology and <b>forensic</b> <b>pathology,</b> which led her to testify in many high-profile criminal cases throughout her career. In addition to working as Denver's city toxicologist, she held positions in multiple hospitals and administrative boards.

40|$|This essay stages a {{critique}} of the unacknowledged racialising visual regimes that inform <b>forensic</b> <b>pathology's</b> typical body charts. In order to disclose these unacknowledged regimes, I stage a genealogy of the racialising iconography that continues to shape <b>forensic</b> <b>pathology's</b> visual texts. In drawing attention to the racialising visual conventions that constitute the contemporary production of caucacentric forensic body charts, I attempt to disrupt the scientifico-objective status of these visual artefacts in order to underscore their ideological effects. By focusing on the ontological/epistemological split between the corporeality of native informants and white knowledge workers, I underscore the white medico-legal profession's historical transmuting of other bodies into objects of knowledge. I conclude by outlining the discursive effects of presenting <b>forensic</b> <b>pathology's</b> caucacentric body charts as demonstrative evidence within the court of law. 34 page(s...|$|R

It sat for 80 days between December 2005 and September 2006, heard from 100 witnesses, including seven of Clonmel's gardaí, and reported in April 2008. In February 2008, Rossiter's family had criticised the Minister for Justice Michael McDowell, believing that he had set up the inquiry under the wrong Act. With the inquiry completed, however, an inquest into Brian Rossiter's death could now be held, as soon as a private action taken by the Rossiter family against Cork City Coroner, to allow evidence from two UK-based Professors of <b>Forensic</b> <b>Pathology</b> to be admissible, was settled.|$|E
25|$|As {{the year}} 654 continued, shortly after Consort Wu {{had given birth}} to her daughter, the baby died, with some {{evidence}} suggesting deliberate strangulation, including allegations by Wu, the child's mother. Consort Wu accused Wang of murder. Wu's rival Wang was accused of having been seen near the child's room, with corroborating testimony by alleged eyewitnesses. Emperor Gaozong was led to believe that Wang had the means to kill the child, and likely done so, motivated by jealousy. Wang lacked an alibi, and was unable to clear herself. Angry, Emperor Gaozong considered deposing Empress Wang and elevating Consort Wu to her position; but, first {{he wanted to make sure}} that the government chancellors would support this. So, Gaozong visited the house of his uncle Zhangsun Wuji, the head chancellor, together with Consort Wu (later Emperor Gaozong would award Chancellor Zhangsun with much treasure). During the meeting, Gaozong several times brought up the topic of Empress Wang's childlessness, a topic easily leading to an excuse sufficient to depose her; however, Zhangsun repeatedly found ways to divert the conversation. Subsequent visits by Consort Wu's mother Lady Yang and the official Xu Jingzong, who was allied with Consort Wu, to seek support from Zhangsun also were to no avail. Scientifically credible <b>forensic</b> <b>pathology</b> information about the death of the child does not exist, and scholars lack real, concrete evidence about her death. However, speculation seems to continue.|$|E

500|$|Industrial groups {{typically}} {{focus on}} transgressive subject matter. In his introduction for the Industrial Culture Handbook (1983), Jon Savage considered some hallmarks of industrial music to be organizational autonomy, shock tactics, {{and the use}} of synthesizers and [...] "anti-music." [...] Furthermore, an interest in the investigation of [...] "cults, wars, psychological techniques of persuasion, unusual murders (especially by children and psychopaths), <b>forensic</b> <b>pathology,</b> venereology, concentration camp behavior, the history of uniforms and insignia" [...] and Aleister Crowley's magick was present in Throbbing Gristle's work, as well as in other industrial pioneers. Burroughs's recordings and writings were particularly influential on the scene, particularly his interest in the cut-up technique and noise as a method of disrupting societal control. Many of the first industrial musicians were interested in, though not necessarily sympathetic with, fascism. Throbbing Gristle's logo was based on the lightning symbol of the British Union of Fascists, while the Industrial Records logo was a photo of Auschwitz.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Forensic</b> <b>pathology</b> {{focuses on}} {{determining}} {{the cause of}} death by post-mortem examination of a corpse or partial remains. [...] An autopsy is typically performed by a coroner or medical examiner, often during criminal investigations; in this role, coroners and medical examiners are also frequently asked to confirm the identity of a corpse. The requirements for becoming a licensed practitioner of <b>forensic</b> <b>pathology</b> varies from country to country (and even within a given nation) but typically a minimal requirement is a medical doctorate with a specialty in general or anatomical pathology with subsequent study in forensic medicine. [...] The methods forensic scientists use to determine death include examination of tissue specimens to identify {{the presence or absence of}} natural disease and other microscopic findings, interpretations of toxicology on body tissues and fluids to determine the chemical cause of overdoses, poisonings or other cases involving toxic agents, and examinations of physical trauma. [...] <b>Forensic</b> <b>pathology</b> is a major component in the trans-disciplinary field of forensic science.|$|E
