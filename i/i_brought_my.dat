500|$|In 2004, Charles re-recorded [...] "Here We Go Again" [...] as a {{duet with}} American singer-songwriter Norah Jones, who grew up {{listening}} to his music. During Jones' Billboard interview for her 2010 collaboration album ...Featuring, which included her [...] "Here We Go Again" [...] duet, she said [...] "I got a call from Ray asking if I'd be interested in singing on this duets record. I got on the next plane and <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>my</b> mom. We went to his studio and did it live with the band. I sang it right next to Ray, watching his mouth for the phrasing. He was very sweet and put me at ease, which was great because I was petrified walking in there." [...] She noted in one ...Featuring interview that the only part that was not done live was a piano overlay that she added afterwards to complement Charles' keyboard. In the same interview, she noted that she had been given the opportunity to select a song from Charles' songbook to perform as a duet and felt that this one provided the best opportunity to harmonize rather than alternate vocal verses. On the record, the two singers vocalize, accompanied by Billy Preston on Hammond organ, who had at one time been the regular organist in Charles' band.|$|E
500|$|Chris Carter {{claimed to}} have been {{inspired}} to write the episode after his dog had worms, a situation he called [...] "very disgusting". He also had been reading about Chernobyl and the extinction of species at the time and blended all three of these concepts when writing the episode. Carter described his mood while writing the episode, [...] "I was in a funk when I wrote that episode. We were coming back from hiatus and I was trying to find something more interesting than just the Flukeman. I was irritated at the time and <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>my</b> irritation to Mulder's attitude. Basically, he had become fed up with the FBI. They had given him what he felt was a low assignment, which was sending him into the city after a dead body. But lo and behold, he finds that this is a case that {{for all intents and purposes}} is an X-File. It's been given to him by a man he's never looked at as an ally, Skinner. So it's an interesting establishing of a relationship between them." [...] Producer J.P. Finn described the episode as a departure from Carter's usual work as it did not deal with an alien subject matter.|$|E
500|$|A {{graduate}} of Columbia University architecture school, Kosinski's knowledge of architecture was pivotal in conceptualizing the Tron: Legacy universe. His approach in cultivating a prototype {{was different from}} other film directors because, according to Kosinski, he came [...] "from a design point of view"; [...] "Some of my favorite directors come from outside of the film business, so that made my approach different from other directors, but a design background makes sense for a movie like this because the whole world {{has to be made}} from scratch." [...] Lisberger would later state that he left the sequel to a different production team because [...] "after thirty years I donâ€™t want to compete with myself", and to showcase how the next generation dealt with the themes contained in Tron - [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>my</b> network in, it would be a little bit like one of those Clint Eastwood movies where all the old guys go to space." [...] Lisberger added that [...] "I dig this role of being the Obi-Wan or the Yoda on this film more than being the guy in the trenches", stating that unlike Kosinski his age was a hindering factor - [...] "I cannot work sixteen hours a day staring at twenty-five monitors for most of that time." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>Brought</b> You <b>My</b> Bullets, You <b>Brought</b> Me Your Love gave My Chemical Romance an {{underground}} following.

2500|$|Quicker than thought <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>my</b> saber {{down with}} all my {{strength}} upon [...] head. He was moving as the blow fell, and I suppose I did not strike him where I intended, for he received a deep saber cut {{in the back of}} the neck. He fell senseless on his side, then rolled over on his back. He had in his hand a short Sharpe's cavalry carbine. I think he had just fired as I reached Colonel Washington, for the Marine who followed me into the aperture made by the ladder received a bullet in the abdomen, from which he died in a few minutes. The shot might have been fired by someone else in the insurgent party, but I think it was from Brown. Instinctively as Brown fell I gave him a saber thrust in the left breast. The sword I carried was a light uniform weapon, and, either not having a point or striking something hard in Brown's accouterments, did not penetrate. The blade bent double.|$|E
