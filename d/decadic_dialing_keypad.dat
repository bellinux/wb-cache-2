5000|$|HTC Touch Dual, {{very similar}} to the {{original}} Touch, {{with the addition of a}} <b>dial</b> <b>keypad</b> and HSDPA (3.5G), 2.8in screen. but removing support for wi-fi.|$|R
50|$|Just {{like the}} Lumia 800, the 900 has the {{diagnostic}} tool. It {{can be obtained}} by pressing ##634# on the <b>dial</b> <b>keypad,</b> which should initiate the download after the last # is pressed. The diagnostic tool should appear on the app list under Diagnostics.|$|R
50|$|When {{released}} at the finger stop, the wheel returns to its home position by spring action {{at a speed}} regulated by a governor device. During this return rotation, the dial interrupts the direct electrical current of the telephone line (local loop) a specific number of times for each digit and thereby generates electrical pulses which the telephone exchange decodes into each dialed digit. Each of the ten digits is encoded in sequences of up to ten pulses so the method is sometimes called <b>decadic</b> <b>dialling.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In most {{countries}} one pulse {{is used for}} the digit 1, two pulses for 2, and so on, with ten pulses for the digit 0; this makes the code unary, excepting the digit 0. Exceptions to this are: Sweden (...) , with one click for 0, two clicks for 1, and so on; and New Zealand with ten clicks for 0, nine clicks for 1, etc. Oslo, the capital city of Norway, used the New Zealand system, {{but the rest of the}} country did not. Systems that used this encoding of the 10 digits in a sequence of up to 10 pulses, are sometimes known as <b>decadic</b> <b>dialing</b> systems.|$|R
50|$|Pulse dialing is a {{signaling}} {{technology in}} telecommunications {{in which a}} direct current local loop circuit is interrupted according to a defined coding system for each signal transmitted, usually a digit. This lends the method the often used name loop disconnect dialing. In the most common variant of pulse <b>dialing,</b> <b>decadic</b> <b>dialing,</b> each of the ten Arabic numerals are encoded in a sequence of up to ten pulses. The most common version decodes the digits 1 through 9, as one to nine pulses, respectively, and the digit 0 as ten pulses. Historically, the most common device to produce such pulse trains is the rotary dial of the telephone, lending the technology another name, rotary dialing.|$|R
50|$|A loop <b>dialling</b> <b>keypad</b> {{version of}} the Trimphone was {{introduced}} in 1976 as the 766. The Trimphones were all fitted with a tone ringer which initially warbled quietly and then louder. With the advent of new style wiring the model numbers were prefixed with an '8' and were fitted with a 4000Ω high impedance ringer and a new style line cord fitted with a 431A plug. In 1982 the final incarnation of the Trimphone was relaunched with {{a new set of}} colours known as The Snowdon Collection.|$|R
50|$|A hotline is a {{point-to-point}} {{communications link}} {{in which a}} call is automatically directed to the preselected destination without any additional action by the user when the end instrument goes off-hook. An example would be a phone that automatically connects to emergency services on picking up the receiver. Therefore, dedicated hotline phones do not need a rotary <b>dial</b> or <b>keypad.</b> A hotline can also be called an automatic signaling, ringdown, or off-hook service.|$|R
50|$|Each {{member of}} the {{audience}} firstly fills out a questionnaire, {{used to describe the}} composition of the audience. Then, each member is given a control device (such as a <b>dial</b> or <b>keypad)</b> with which they select their feelings towards the vision or stimuli (for example, whether they regard the comments currently being made by a speaker favourably or unfavourably). This dial is checked centrally three times per second, and as the audience reacts differently over time, the collective feelings of the audience are gathered.|$|R
50|$|Possibly one of {{the first}} {{phreaking}} methods was switch-hooking, which allows placing calls from a phone where the rotary <b>dial</b> or <b>keypad</b> has been disabled by a key lock or other means to prevent unauthorized calls from that phone. It is done by rapidly pressing and releasing the switch hook to open and close the subscriber circuit, simulating the pulses generated by the rotary dial. Even most current telephone exchanges support this method, as they need to be backward compatible with old subscriber hardware.|$|R
40|$|The essay {{explores the}} {{development}} of the design of telephones from the early times to recent trends (2004). Its focus is the psychological meaning of the changing relation of telephones to the user 2 ̆ 7 s body (bodily based acting). Aspects of formal aesthetics ("design 2 ̆ 7 in a more narrow but common understanding) of telephones (and other products) are looked at in this broader perspective which could be labelled "phenomenology of embodied technology 2 ̆ 7. — The first chapter puts telephones {{in the context of the}} general trend to small, compact, mobile, and multifunctional devices. The second chapter describes the changing choreography of using a telephone ("From habitus to gesture 2 ̆ 7). The third chapter takes a closer look at the (non-) wiredness of users ("cutting the user 2 ̆ 7 s umbilical cord 2 ̆ 7); this chapter includes an excursion about the habits of ?mindless 2 ̆ 7 playing with cords and scribbling while being connected. The fourth chapter analyses psychological implications of {{the development of}} interfaces (rest/cradle, <b>dial,</b> <b>keypad,</b> display). The fifth chapter takes into account the acoustic/auditory relation between apparatus and user ("The call of the apparatus 2 ̆ 7). The final chapter discusses the telephone as a "design object 2 ̆ 7 (in a narrower sense) in the border perspective of the evolution of telephones (telephone-user-relation) ...|$|R
50|$|From a {{customer}} perspective, IP telephony uses a high-bandwidth Internet connection and specialized {{customer premises equipment}} to transmit telephone calls via the Internet, or any modern private data network. The customer equipment may be an analog telephone adapter (ATA) which interfaces a conventional analog telephone to the IP networking equipment, {{or it may be}} an IP Phone that has the networking and interface technology built into the desk-top set and provides the traditional, familiar parts of a telephone, the handset, the <b>dial</b> or <b>keypad,</b> and a ringer in a package that usually resembles a standard telephone set.|$|R
50|$|Historically, not all {{push-button}} telephones used DTMF dialing technology. Some manufacturers implemented pulse <b>dialing</b> with push-button <b>keypads</b> {{and even}} Western Electric produced several telephone models with a push-button keypad that could also emit traditional dial pulses. Sometimes the mode was user-selectable with a {{switch on the}} telephone. Pulse-mode push-button keypads typically stored the dialed number sequence in a digit collector register to permit rapid dialing for the user. Some push button pulse dial phones allow for double-speed pulse dialing. These allow even faster pulse dialing in exchanges that recognize double-speed pulse dialing.|$|R
50|$|The {{essential}} elements of a telephone are a microphone (transmitter) to speak into and an earphone (receiver) which reproduces the voice in a distant location. In addition, most telephones contain a ringer which produces a sound to announce an incoming telephone call, and a <b>dial</b> or <b>keypad</b> used to enter a telephone number when initiating a call to another telephone. Until approximately the 1970s most telephones used a rotary dial, which was superseded by the modern DTMF push-button dial, first introduced to the public by AT&T in 1963. The receiver and transmitter are usually built into a handset which is held up to the ear and mouth during conversation. The dial may be located either on the handset, or on a base unit to which the handset is connected. The transmitter converts the sound waves to electrical signals which are sent through the telephone network to the receiving phone. The receiving telephone converts the signals into audible sound in the receiver, or sometimes a loudspeaker. Telephones permit duplex communication, meaning they allow the people on both ends to talk simultaneously.|$|R
40|$|The {{interface}} {{of public}} payphone equipment in Malaysia {{is comprised of}} the <b>keypad</b> <b>dial</b> area, the telephone receiver, coin or card insert-return areas, liquid crystal display (LCD) unit, and the main housing itself. As icons play {{a very important role}} in the user interaction and overall semantics of the payphone, this paper studies the design of public payphone icons in relation to its intended function. A survey was conducted to determine the public perception of icons presently found on payphones installed around the Malaysia. Subsequently, a new set of icon designs were proposed and evaluated for its effectiveness. This paper concludes with the discussion of the survey results and recommendations for improving the icon design that is capable of enhancing the usability of Malaysian public payphones...|$|R
40|$|Malaysia is {{a member}} of ASEAN's {{universal}} service obligation (USO) initiative by the International Telecommunication Union's attempt to balance the rural and urban telecommunication accessibility in the region. The first prerogative in the Malaysian USO was the provision of public telecommunication services and accessibility. Works to allocate public telecommunication access and equipment have begun all over the country since 2007. The interface of a local public payphone comprise of the phone receiver, <b>keypad</b> <b>dial</b> area, coin/card insert-return areas, liquid crystal display unit, and the main housing area itself. The main operating interface between a user and the payphone is the icon as it is designed to represent a certain function of the device. A survey with 160 respondents was collected to study the icons used in relation to the public payphone's functions, and to determine the level of user comprehension. As Malaysia has diverse cultural, ethnic and social values, it is the challenge of the present ergonomics study to highlight the commonly preferred icons together with its intended functions on the public payphones. The results show that text-only icons and representations are recommended for certain functions as compared to graphic-only icons in the Malaysian context...|$|R
