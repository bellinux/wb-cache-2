Three wires, having ratios of length to diameter in the approximate proportion 1 : 5 : 10, were tested in the vertical position. Due to time limitations, only the shortest of these was tested in a horizontal position. A check was made {{to determine whether the}} results were influenced by the geometry of the enclosing vessel. For pressures at which the molecular mean free path is smaller than the wire diameter, the results appear to satisfy a relation of a form derived for free-molecule heat conduction. Small departures from this behavior at the higher pressures are attributed to the effects of natural convection. The Nusselt number was found not to be uniquely related to the product of the Grashof and Prandtl numbers, as has been proposed, for values of this product below 10 [^- 5].

In order to enhance urban appeal as well as the safety and comfort daily life, the snow melting system of the pavement has been getting more recognition in the central are of the city.

The critical oxygen concentration which separates the local reaction and explosion regimes depends on the experimental conditions: gas composition, pressure, temperature, wire size and orientation, and gas velocity.

Plahyd S is a synthetic, rapidly biodegradable fluid {{which is based}} on sustainable raw materials. It is exceptionally suitable for applications in mobile and stationary hydraulic systems. Plahyd N is multigrade hydraulic oil based on rapeseed oil used in agricultural and construction machinery. For thermal parameters measurements was used Hot wire method. The experiment is based on measuring of the temperature rise vs. time evaluation of an <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> <b>wire</b> embedded in the tested material. The thermal conductivity is derived from the resulting change in temperature over a known time interval. Dependency of material resistance against the probe rotation was used at measurement of rheologic properties with instrument viscometer Anton Paar DV- 3 P. For two samples of biooils – Plahyd N and Plahyd S were determined basic thermophysical parameters – thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity and volume specific heat. For each biooil samples were made two series of measurements. In the first series were measured thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity at constant room temperature 20 °C. Every thermophysical parameter was measured 10 times for each sample. The results were statistically processed. For biooil No 1 thermal conductivity was 0. 325 W*m - 1. K- 1, it was higher value than we obtained for biooil No 2 – 0. 224 W*m - 1. K- 1. The similar results were obtained for thermal diffusivity of biooil No 1 2. 140. 10 - 7 m 2 *s - 1 and biooil No 2 2. 604. 10 - 7 m 2 * s - 1. For samples with constant temperature were calculated basic statistical characteristics as: standard deviation for ? – biooil No 1 (± 0. 056 W*m - 1 *K - 1) and biooil No 2 (± 0. 054 W*m - 1 *K - 1); probable error of the arithmetic average for ? – biooil No 1 (± 0. 012 W*m - 1 *K - 1) and biooil No 2 (± 0. 005 W*m - 1 *K - 1); relative probable error in % for ? – biooil No 1 (± 3. 69 %) and biooil No 2 (± 2. 23 %). The same statistical characteristics were calculated for thermal diffusivity. In the second series of measurements were measured relations of thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity to the temperature in temperature range (20 – 29) °C. From results was evident that all measured dependencies are nonlinear. For both thermophysical parameters were obtained polynomial functions of the second degree described by the polynomial coefficients. Type of function was selected according to statistical evaluation based on the coefficient of determination for every thermophysical parameter graphical dependency. In temperature dependency of rapeseed oil dynamic viscosity was used decreasing exponential function, which is in accordance with Arrhenius equation.

40|$|Gas-lifted {{oil wells}} are {{susceptible}} to failure through mal-function of gas lift valves (GLV). One failure mode occurs when the GLV check valve fails and product passes into the well an-nulus, potentially reaching the wellhead. This is a growing con-cern as offshore wells are drilled thousands of meters below the ocean floor in extreme temperature and pressure conditions and repair and monitoring become difficult. The authors have pre-viously developed a thermally-actuated safety valve to prevent product backflow into the annulus {{in the event of}} check valve failure. The safety valve uses shape memory alloy (SMA) wires to translate a temperature change into a displacement and, based on commercially available SMA wire material properties, re-quires a 6 ◦C temperature change to fully actuate. In some wells, however, check valve failure may result in less than 6 ◦C tem-perature change. In this paper a new concept is developed to sharpen the austenitic phase change in SMA actuators. The concept has broad practical implications because it will allow thermally-activated devices, such as fluid control valves, to be-come much more precise, i. e., translating a small temperature change into a large displacement. The new concept uses the fact that SMA transition temperatures are stress dependent. By specifically controlling stress in the wire, the temperature differ-ence required for austenitic transition can be decreased. This is achieved with a negative-differential spring- a spring that ex-erts a decreasing amount of force as it is displaced. The concept is tested experimentally by conductively and <b>electrically</b> <b>heating</b> SMA <b>wires</b> connected to a negative-differential spring. Results show a 2. 9 ◦C- 5 ◦C reductions, respectively, in the temperature difference required for austenitic transition...|$|R
30|$|In {{many studies}} (such as those by Stec and Hull (2011), Purser and Purser (2008 a) and Blomqvist et al. (2007)), {{the sample is}} raised to a fixed furnace temperature, which is further {{increased}} in the gas phase during flaming combustion. This {{will result in a}} HCN yield related that specific furnace temperature. However, during the combustion of polyurethane foams, the HCN yield is notably higher when the fire progresses from smouldering to flaming combustion. This was observed by Levin et al. (1985) when a flexible polyurethane foam was first heated at a temperature below its auto-ignition temperature, followed by flaming combustion of the remaining char and residue at a higher temperature. The authors intended to compare the HCN yields for the non-flaming and flaming combustion of the foam in a smoke chamber apparatus (as described in Levin et al. 1982) to that of a large scale test room. The test room was 2.4 [*]×[*] 3.0 [*]×[*] 3.0  m with a door (dimensions not specified) and a 1 to 2  kg slab of foam in the centre of the room. Smouldering was forced by an <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> resistance <b>wire</b> embedded in the sample and a load cell measured the mass of the sample throughout the experiment. In the smoke chamber, the highest reported yield during flaming combustion was 1.02  mg g− 1. In the large scale test room, the sample smouldered for 1.5 to 2  h, resulting in a HCN yield of 1.03  mg g− 1. Once the material ignited, the yield of HCN increased to 3.8  mg g− 1. While the smoke chamber experiment is known to give low HCN yields, and both scenarios are well-ventilated, the yield of HCN was almost 4 times as high during flaming combustion if the sample was allowed to smoulder first.|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} the mutual interactions between droplets in the spray combustion, combustion of 2 -dimensionally arranged quasi-droplet clusters is studied under microgravity. Quasi-droplet samples, which are solid in room temperature and change into liquid {{just after the}} ignition, consist of alcohol (propanol, butanol, pentanol, or hexanol) and polyethylene glycol with a volumetric ratio of 2 : 1. Seven samples sustained by glass rods form a 2 -dimensional quasi-droplet cluster. <b>Electrically</b> <b>heated</b> nichrome <b>wires</b> ignite all samples in the cluster simultaneously. Single envelope flames that surround the clusters appeared. The {{results show that the}} sample spacing has a strong effect on the shape and movement of the flame. Sample clusters with large sample spacings come to the external group combustion through the scavenging combustion mode, whereas the small spacing clusters start directly with the external group combustion. At large sample spacings, the distance {{from the edge of the}} sample cluster to the flame (flame distance) increases to a maximum value and then decreases with time. The period of flame growth is prolonged with decreasing sample spacing and finally, at a small enough sample spacing, the flame distance keeps increasing until the flame disappears. This flame movement is attributed to the fuel vapor accumulation effect, which becomes more dominant with decreasing sample spacing. The burning lifetime decreases monotonically and approaches the value of the single flame with increasing sample spacing. The flame distance decreases monotonically and approaches the single flame radius with increasing sample spacing also. These results render important confirmations of the external group combustion phenomena and prove the importance of the two kinds of unsteadiness, i. e., the scavenging combustion with large droplet interval and the fuel vapor accumulation effect with small droplet interval, in group combustion.
