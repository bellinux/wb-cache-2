5|$|As {{part of the}} {{resurgence}} of interest in tap <b>dancing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980s, Sandman Sims served as a cultural ambassador, representing the United States with dance performances around the world. He was featured in the 1989 dance film Tap, along with Sammy Davis Jr., Gregory Hines and Savion Glover, demonstrating classic challenge dancing. Sims also appeared in a 1990 episode of The Cosby Show as Rudy's tap dancing teacher, facing off against Cliff (Bill Cosby) in a good-natured tap challenge.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} chorus begins, earlier {{scenes from the}} video are intercut with each other; Rihanna is shown {{commanding}} her troops, firing a machine gun, and <b>dancing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bunker. As the second verse begins, Rihanna is seen with slicked-back hair wearing a metal bikini top, rolling in mud and surrounded by troops on a stone structure before a mountainous backdrop. She is shown gambling with (and winning against) soldiers in another bunker.|$|E

Dancers and other performers at the crop over festivals, for example, are popular and an iconic part of Barbadian culture, known for <b>dancing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> costumes of sugarcane-cutters. The Landship movement features song and dance meant to imitate the passage of a British navy ship through rough seas; Landship and other occasions also feature African-derived improvised and complexly-rhythmic dances, and British hornpipes, jigs, maypole dances and Marches.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Jonas & François and released on 13 March 2013. Inspired by several films, it features Azalea performing twerking sequences and a recreation of Vanessa Ferlito's lap <b>dancing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2007 film, Death Proof. The video earned Azalea a nomination for Artist to Watch at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, and was praised by critics for its fashion, and portrayal of the song's lyrics. Among her live performance staples, Azalea promoted the single with live renditions on Britain & Ireland's Next Top Model and Nikki & Sara Live. It was {{also included in the}} set list for her The New Classic Tour (2014). A number of remixes were commissioned for the single's release, including an official remix featuring American rapper Wale.|$|E
5|$|In {{the video}} Rihanna and two friends {{arrive at a}} nightclub in a yellow taxi, and enter a candy store where a boy is {{standing}} with his mother. Rihanna tells the boy not to tell anyone where they are going, and the singer and her friends sneak {{into the back of}} the store (where there is a secret nightclub entrance). The narrative is intercut with Rihanna singing the song against a wall and <b>dancing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> club. After she enters the club, she checks her makeup in a restroom as she sings.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> second chorus, Usher {{performs}} choreography <b>in</b> <b>the</b> club, {{backed up}} by several male dancers. Female dancers then come in, performing choreography along with Usher and the male dancers. After Lil Jon sprays champagne towards <b>the</b> camera <b>in</b> <b>the</b> laser scene, Ludacris performs his verse. He is <b>dancing</b> <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> club and laser scene, with the camera also alternating to female's <b>dancing</b> <b>in</b> sync <b>in</b> <b>the</b> club.|$|R

5|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} begins with Carey, revisiting her youth, wandering {{a high school}} corridor and standing inside a classroom of schoolchildren playing various musical instruments with inter-cutting clips of men playing on drums. Clips of a schoolgirl playing Carey are also shown, with Carey shadowing her movements, and her efforts to catch a schoolboy's attention who in turn persistently ignores her, choosing to mess about {{in the classroom and}} corridors with his friends instead. Towards the end of the video, groups of schoolchildren are shown <b>dancing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corridor as the boy she liked, now an adult, is following Carey around the school and trying to flirt with her, but Carey brushes him off. The official music video has achieved 3.3 million views on YouTube as of June 2017.|$|E
5|$|The sexual {{freedoms of}} Liao also stood in stark {{contrast}} {{from those of the}} Han Chinese. Women from the upper Liao classes, like those of the Han Chinese upper classes, had arranged marriages, in some cases for political purposes. However women from the lower classes of the Liao did not have arranged marriages, and would attract suitors by singing and <b>dancing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> streets. The songs served as self-advertisements, with the women telling of their beauty, familial status, and domestic skills. Virginity was not a requirement for marriage among the Liao, and many Liao women were sexually promiscuous before marriage, which stood in sharp contrast from the beliefs of the Han Chinese. Khitan women had the right to divorce their husbands and were able to remarry after being divorced.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} {{cinematic}} black bars expanding {{to reveal the}} scenery, which {{is set in a}} beach. Individual takes of the girls are shown momentarily as Dinah sings the chorus. The camera shifts to Fetty Wap, who is sitting down in a chair with a guitar next to him. As he sings, the girls are seen <b>dancing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water, with Lauren kicking the water as the video goes into a slow-motion take for less than a second. Several of the scenes include Normani alone in a rock cliff, a close-up of Dinah singing and a shot of the girls together near the water.|$|E
50|$|The {{club has}} been a {{cultural}} center since the founding of a Maennerchor and singing group. Most traditional <b>dancing</b> began <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1930s.|$|R
2500|$|Modern Highland <b>dancing</b> emerged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19th and 20th centuries. It was [...] "created {{from the}} Gaelic folk dance repertoire, but formalized with the {{conventions}} of ballet".|$|R
50|$|A {{music video}} was {{produced}} for this song <b>in</b> October 1987. <b>The</b> video features several couples <b>dancing</b> like <b>in</b> <b>the</b> movie, {{and it also}} featured clips from it.|$|R
5|$|The visual {{opens with}} a small {{microscopic}} organism-like figure, eventually zooming out on an animated woman. <b>Dancing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wind, the opening chorus has the woman gliding through a vast field of clouds, often flying {{in front of the}} sun. A strong force field follows her as she is about to land onto buildings, but intercuts into Utada walking through digitized clouds. The camera then changes positions, aimed towards the singer, and showcases her walking through a large grand hall with purple colored Kachina's in cloaks, hitting drums to the songs beat. She walks into a large cathedral-like infrastructure and summons numerous pink kachina's dancing to the tune.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the name}} Lucille LeSueur, Crawford began <b>dancing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> choruses of {{traveling}} revues and was spotted dancing in Detroit by producer Jacob J. Shubert. Shubert {{put her in}} the chorus line for his 1924 show, Innocent Eyes, at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway in New York City. While appearing in Innocent Eyes Crawford met a saxophone player named James Welton. The two were allegedly married in 1924 and lived together for several months, although this supposed marriage was never mentioned in later life by Crawford.|$|E
5|$|When Kukunoor was {{thinking}} of a character full of disguises, he first {{came up with an}} old man. When the thought of a scene with the three major characters <b>dancing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dunes came up, he realized that an older character could not realistically dance in the desert. He immediately felt that Shreyas Talpade, whom he knew of knowing mimicry, could be used for bahuroopiya. Kukunoor, who worked previously with Girish Karnad, said that he was the strength for the film and added that he found him a good actor and a good human being.|$|E
50|$|Goodman {{began her}} film career at Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts in 1978, when shot {{a film about}} masked <b>dancing</b> <b>in</b> Indonesia. <b>The</b> film earned her {{a grant from the}} Ford Foundation which {{ultimately}} paved the way for her career in filmmaking.|$|R

25|$|Mathilde Froustey started <b>dancing</b> <b>in</b> Dax <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{south of}} France <b>in</b> 1994 at <b>the</b> age of 9, because ballet {{training}} was helpful for her back problems.|$|R
5|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} the Wootton Hall is its pair of Italian black and Beschia marble blackamoor torchères, originally given to the First Duke of Marlborough as a present from General Charles Churchill. In exceptionally good condition, they stand {{either side of the}} door into the Saloon. These were discovered in the silt of the River Tiber and are depictions of slaves who once served in a Roman household. Several flags stand above them, including the White Ensign. The ceiling is intricately made, featuring flowers in the plaster, each one different, the work of Colen Campbell in the early 18th century. The black and white check marble floor is also a distinguishing {{feature of the}} room, but through most of its history this floor would have been left plain as horses and carriages would enter the hall inside. In the mid 19th century Frederick, the 4th Earl, had laid down brown and blue tiles, replaced by the marble floor which was added by his son Robert in around 1910. The floor gives significant depth to the hall and provides fine acoustics, so much that Diana would once practice her tap <b>dancing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hall as a teenager.|$|E
5|$|Swigmore University, which Moe attends in the episode, is {{a parody}} of Skidmore College. The {{professor}} working at Swigmore University is based on Professor Charles W. Kingsfield, Jr. from the television series The Paper Chase. Moe's new bar M is a parody on the luxury boutique hotel W in New York City that Gould had visited once. The monitors showing eyeballs are based on similar decorations found in the elevators in the St Martin's Lane hotel, where the Simpsons staff hosted a Simpsons festival. The doorman in front of M was modeled after special effects creator and actor Greg Nicotero. The dance that Homer, Carl and Lenny perform in Moe's bar is a takeoff on the <b>dancing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> comedy/drama film Coyote Ugly, in which the dancers performed on the bar counter, much like Homer, Carl and Lenny do in the episode.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} Boorong {{people of}} northwestern Victoria {{saw it as}} Won, a boomerang thrown by Totyarguil (Altair). The Aranda people of Central Australia saw Corona Australis as a coolamon carrying a baby, which was accidentally dropped to earth {{by a group of}} sky-women <b>dancing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Milky Way. The impact of the coolamon created Gosses Bluff crater, 175km west of Alice Springs. The Torres Strait Islanders saw Corona Australis {{as part of a larger}} constellation encompassing part of Sagittarius and the tip of Scorpius's tail; the Pleiades and Orion were also associated. This constellation was Tagai's canoe, crewed by the Pleiades, called the Usiam, and Orion, called the Seg. The myth of Tagai says that he was in charge of this canoe, but his crewmen consumed all of the supplies onboard without asking permission. Enraged, Tagai bound the Usiam with a rope and tied them to the side of the boat, then threw them overboard. Scorpius's tail represents a suckerfish, while Eta Sagittarii and Theta Coronae Australis mark the bottom of the canoe. On the island of Futuna, the figure of Corona Australis was called Tanuma and in the Tuamotus, it was called Na Kaua-ki-Tonga.|$|E

5|$|The second chorus has {{the girls}} {{dancing on the}} table, {{knocking}} several pieces of food and tuppleware onto the ground. A-Chan is seen lying down on a pillow, whilst Kashiyuka balances a book and an apple on her head. Both of these scenes have them throwing several pieces of food onto the table. Nocchi is seen at the dining table, holding a fork and listen to music through her headphones. She witnesses a small door underneath a stool, opens it, and sees a small green room. In the room, a blurred image of a cup starts to become clear, and holds small candy. As the girls eat the pieces of candy, their cream-coloured dresses turn into the outfits from the cover sleeve from the single. The girls start <b>dancing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fish bowl, surrounded by glittery lights. The final scene has the girls looking through the small door again, only to witness {{the dining room table}} empty; the small cup with candy appears in beige colouring rather than full-on vibrancy.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Beyoncé {{in a red}} dress moving across a screen of {{multiple}} changing colors and then moves to multiple shots of Elliott rapping in a white and red jersey and matching hat, Lyte in a blue dress, and a church choir group. Next, Elliott is shown on roller skates in a white and black outfit rollerskating throughout the mansion. Shots are shown of Elliott {{in bed with a}} man and Beyoncé at a party with a guy and singing to the people there. As the song moves to Beyoncé singing the chorus, she is shown sitting on a bed and dancing in a room in a golden top and black shorts, while back at the party, she is singing for her lover and blowing him kisses. The song then moves to a verse by Mc Lyte and we see her <b>dancing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of a semi-circle of men wearing orange prison jumpsuits. Scenes of the movie and of Mc Lyte in front of an ever-changing background are intercut throughout this.|$|E
5|$|The video {{features}} Bieber dancing along several dance crews along a black backdrop, and a {{scene with}} ninjas and a flame outline. The video begins with Bieber dancing with different {{members of the}} crews with use of a spotlight effect, followed by Bieber being flaunted by a single female dancer. Then the video cuts to Bieber performing Stepping (African-American)-style choreography with two male dancers, shirtless with red hats and red suspenders. With the aid of smoke, the video moves to Bieber dancing with Beat Freaks. Usher sings his verse along with The Syrenz as dancers {{in a room with}} metal chandeliers before uniting with Bieber <b>dancing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> scene aided by Poreotics. Then Bieber and Usher sing and dance with Medea Sirkas in ninja attire in front of a background of Chinese calligraphy ("Love") and flames, before returning to the black backdrop and metal chandeliers as Bieber dances with Simrin Player and LXD in a scene with bookbags. The ending features Bieber and several of the dancers featured performing group choreography before cutting to Bieber and Usher with the in front of the calligraphy and flames.|$|E
