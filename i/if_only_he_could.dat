Dan and Maddy have always been {{incredibly}} close without becoming lovers, but it is obvious that they are great together, so when it happens it is effortless and joyous and has wonderful potential. But Dan's private demons prevent it from being allowed to live and grow. I always thought it might be great for him, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have let it be." ...|$|E
500|$|Ibn Muljam met up {{with two}} other Kharijites namely al-Burak ibn Abd Allah and Amr ibn Bakr al-Tamimi at Mecca, and {{concluded}} that the situation of the Muslims at the time was due to the errors of Ali, Muawiah and Amr ibn As, governor of Egypt. They decided to kill the three in order to resolve the [...] "deplorable situation" [...] of their time and also avenge their companions killed at Nahrawan. Aiming to kill Ali, Ibn Muljam headed toward Kufa where {{he fell in love with}} a woman whose brother and father had died at Nahrawan. She agreed to marry him <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> kill Ali. Consequently, Ali was stabbed by Ibn Muljam at the Great Mosque of Kufa. After Ali's death, Ibn Muljam was executed in retaliation by Hasan ibn Ali.|$|E
2500|$|As {{they split}} up Regina and Robin are being {{followed}} by a resident (the person that Regina choked back in the Enchanted Forest), who leads them to Cora, who is {{the mayor of the}} Underworld Storybrooke. Cora offers Regina a way out, telling her she has one hour to leave on the ferry with Henry and Robin. She then takes Regina to a ledge over the Phlegethon, the River of Fire. She threatens to send Regina's father to a worse place if Regina does not comply, and she uses her messenger as an example by sending him off into the flames. Around the same time, Mary Margaret enters a Underworld version of Granny's and is recognized by the Blind Witch by her smell, and is then encountered by David wearing different clothes and proceeds to kiss her, as she realizes it's James, who is the [...] "Sheriff" [...] in this world. Gold goes to the Underworld version of his pawn shop and encounters his father Malcolm, whose soul must live as Peter Pan. Knowing already what Gold wants, Pan is willing to make a deal with no strings attached. However, he urges Gold to leave the Underworld, telling him that the others aren't his real friends, but Gold ignores his plea, accepting some sort of potion. Pan ominously adds that he himself would be able to leave, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> trade places with a living soul, although Gold refuses this. As everyone meets up again, Regina tells the others about Cora's warning, while Gold gives Emma the potion he obtained, which is from DunBroch, and can be used to summon the dead by pouring it over someone's grave. Gold explains {{it can be used to}} summon Hook and ask him where he is, but will not join them as he has decided that he is returning to Storybrooke.|$|E
60|$|Da Souza {{smiled in}} a {{superior}} manner; {{the smile of}} a man who, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>he</b> would, <b>could</b> explain all things. He patted his daughter {{on the head with}} a touch which was meant to be playful.|$|R
60|$|<b>If</b> <b>only</b> even <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{surrender}} to the sudden vision: 'What does it all matter?' Forget himself for a minute, forget that it mattered what he did, forget that whatever he did he must sacrifice something.|$|R
6000|$|If {{the young}} gentleman fresh from College or the maiden lady Understander could be, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> {{for a month}} or two, a father! <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>he</b> or she <b>could</b> guess how gladly the father of limited income would reply, ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{there was}} Winifred! <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be sure about her, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be sure. Since {{the death of}} Diana, and the {{development}} of his illness, his craving for surety with regard to Winifred amounted almost to obsession. It was as if, even dying, he must have some anxiety, some responsibility of love, of Charity, upon his heart.|$|E
6000|$|He {{turned and}} glanced at his companion. Sophy was looking very sweet and very wistful. The warm touch of her fingers was grateful. Her sympathy was like some welcome flower in a wilderness. His heart ached with a new desire. <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> make himself different! <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> stretch out his hand for the flowers which made the lives of other men so sweet! ...|$|E

5000|$|Socrates' {{response}} puts Plato in {{a difficult}} situation. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not throw Socrates into the water, because if he did he would violate his promise to let Socrates cross the bridge if he speaks the truth. On the other hand, if Plato allows Socrates to cross the bridge it would mean that Socrates spoke untruth when he replied: [...] "You are going to throw me into the water." [...] In that case Socrates should have been thrown into the water. In other words, Socrates could be allowed to cross the bridge <b>if</b> and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not be.|$|R
6000|$|... "O, don't!--oh, ye mustn't!" [...] said Tom, {{grasping}} his hand; [...] "he's a poor mis'able critter! it's {{awful to}} think on 't! Oh, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>only</b> <b>could</b> repent, the Lord would forgive him now; but I'm 'feared he never will!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You're really awfully kind, Lancaster,' Berkeley {{answered}} warmly. 'No other fellow {{would do}} as much for Le Breton as you do. I admit he's absolutely impracticable, but I would give more than I can tell you <b>if</b> <b>only</b> I thought <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be made to pull through somehow.' ...|$|R
6000|$|From far in {{the clear}} air the bells of the church where he and Irene had been married were pealing in 'practice' for the advent of Christ, the chimes ringing out above the sound of traffic. He felt a craving for strong drink, to lull him to indifference, or rouse him to fury. <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> burst out of himself, out of this web {{that for the first}} time in his life he felt around him. <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{surrender}} to the thought: 'Divorce her--turn her out! She has forgotten you. Forget her!' ...|$|E
6000|$|After that Lewisham went on his southward way alone. He {{did not go}} {{straight}} to his room in Chelsea, but spent some hours in a street in Battersea, pacing to and fro {{in front of a}} possible house. His passion changed from savageness to a tender longing. <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> see her to-night! He knew his own mind now. To-morrow he was resolved he would fling work to the dogs and meet her. The things Dunkerley had said had filled his mind with wonderful novel thoughts. <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> see her now! ...|$|E

I starved. <b>If</b> <b>only</b> once, madly, <b>he</b> had crushed me in his arms! <b>If</b> <b>only</b> once <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have lingered with me five minutes from his own {{business}} or from his fidelity to his employers! Sometimes I could have screamed, or showered the eternal bowl of hot porridge into his face, or smashed the sewing machine upon the floor and danced a hula on it, just to make him burst out and lose his temper and be human, be a brute, be a man of some sort instead of a grey, frozen demi-god." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bachman {{agreed to}} {{rearrange}} the album sequence so the song could be added, but <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> re-record the vocals first, without the stutter. Fach agreed, but Bachman says [...] "I tried {{to sing it}} normal, but I sounded like Frank Sinatra. It didn't fit." [...] Fach said to leave it as it was, with the stutter.|$|R
50|$|Dance {{improvisation}} is {{not only}} about creating new movement but is also defined as freeing the body from habitual movement patterns (see Postmodern dance and Judson Dance Theater). Dancer and singer Michael Jackson combined improvisation in both of those definitions, insisting that he had interest in performing a dance to Billie Jean <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do it a new way each time.|$|R
60|$|Hal {{drew a deep}} breath. <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{find out}} Ferris' mission. He felt certain the meeting between the {{book-keeper}} and the former office-boy was {{to be an important}} one.|$|E

50|$|After {{more than}} a decade of working as a filmmaker, Broomfield altered his film style, {{appearing}} on-screen for the first time in Driving Me Crazy (1988). After several arguments regarding the budget and nature of the film, he decided that he would make the documentary <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> experiment by filming the very process of making the filmâ€”the arguments, the failed interviews and the dead-ends.|$|R
5000|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} with The A.V. Club, Charles Napier recalled {{being invited to}} star again on Star Trek, {{as part of an}} anniversary celebration. He agreed to appear <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> play a military character and not [...] "wear that silly shirt again". His next Star Trek character would be General Denning in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode [...] "Little Green Men".|$|R
5000|$|From the PAP {{definition}} [...] "a {{person is}} morally {{responsible for what}} <b>he</b> has done <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have done otherwise", Frankfurt infers {{that a person is}} not morally responsible for what he has done if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not have done otherwise - a point with which he takes issue: our theoretical ability to do otherwise, he says, does not necessarily make it possible for us to do otherwise.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed he is. Why, he {{encourages}} his sister! He {{would not}} mind her marrying a shoeblack <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> debase his own family. Think what I must feel, I, with my darling boys!" ...|$|E

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the series, Jerry assaults a gay firefighter only to reveal later that he has a gay son who works for the Boston Fire Department that he has all but disowned. He finally comes to grips with his son's homosexuality, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> find someone to help him take care of his wife who is now suffering from Alzheimer's. At the end of season two, he is forced to put his wife in a home when her mental condition becomes too much for him to handle. Their separation is very painful for the Chief emotionally as well as financially, as the cost of his wife's care has used up whatever money he had saved.|$|R
50|$|The Panic of 1837 and {{the ensuing}} lean {{economic}} times strained the church's finances enough that it seriously considered closing in 1842. It did not, and in 1846 hired Dr. Albert Traver, a rector who pioneered in diversity and multiculturalism by accepting the job <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> continue his work ministering to German immigrants in the Town of Clinton nearby, in rural northern Dutchess County, one Sunday a month.|$|R
60|$|This {{knowledge}} {{helped him}} to recover his complete presence of mind. No thought of fighting or trying to escape his fate entered his head for a moment. It had been useless probably, and undoubtedly it was better so. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>only</b> <b>could</b> see Jeanne, and assure himself {{that she would be}} safe in consequence of his own arrest, then, indeed, life could hold no greater happiness for him.|$|R
60|$|He went on, {{disposing}} of her. <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be with her! All he wanted now was to marry her, {{to be sure}} of her. Yet all the time he was perfectly, perfectly hopeless, cold, extinct, without emotion or connection.|$|E
60|$|And Gwendoline was so happy, too, over Granville Kelmscott's return! How {{could he}} endure that Granville Kelmscott's return {{should be the}} signal for {{discovering}} her father's sin and shame to her! <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have married her off before it all came out! Or <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> die before the man was tried!--Tried! Sir Gilbert's eyes started from his head with horror. What was that Elma Clifford suggested the other night? Why--if the man was arrested, he would be arrested at Plymouth, the moment he landed, and would be tried for murder at the Western Assizes. And it was he himself, Sir Gilbert Gildersleeve, who was that term to take the Western Circuit.|$|E

500|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{conclusion}} of the match, WWE Chairman Vince McMahon interrupted to cut a promo. He told Cena that he would be going to WrestleMania XXVI, <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> beat Batista, and then ordered Cena to face Batista in a previously unannounced match for the WWE Championship.
