5000|$|In {{the above}} example, [...] {{will hold the}} error number (if any, it will be zero if no error exists), [...] will be a terse text {{description}} of the error, [...] will represent the <b>disk</b> <b>track</b> where the error occurred, and [...] will be the sector on track [...] to which the error refers. If no error exists, the equivalent of 00,OK,00,00 will be returned in the four variables. Note that [...] is a run mode only verb. Also, in programs that issue many disk commands it is customary to open a file to the device's command channel {{at the start of}} the program and not close it until the program has finished.|$|E
50|$|A typical {{command line}} would {{start with a}} letter such as 'X' (examine memory) {{followed}} by a hexadecimal word (the memory address 01AB) and enter or space. After this sequence {{the content of the}} memory location would be shown FF and the user could enter a hexadecimal byte 00 to replace the contents of the address, or hit space or enter to move to the next address 01AB. An experienced user could enter a small program in this manner, entering machine language from memory. Because of the simple structure of the program, consisting of a vector table (one for each letter) and a small number of subroutines, and because the source code was readily available, adding or modifying Zapple was straightforward. The dominant operating system of the era, CP/M, required the computer manufacturer or hobbyist to develop hardware specific BIOS. Many users tested their BIOS subroutines using Zapple to verify, for example, a floppy <b>disk</b> <b>track</b> seek command, or read sector command, etc., was functioning correctly by extending Zapple to accommodate these operations in the hardware environment.|$|E

5000|$|Apple DOS 3.3 was {{released}} in 1980. It improves various functions of release 3.2, while also allowing for large gains in available floppy disk storage; the newer P5A/P6A PROMs in the disk controller can read and write data at a higher density, so that instead of 13 sectors (3.25 KiB), 16 sectors (4 KiB) of data can be stored per <b>disk</b> <b>track,</b> increasing the capacity from 113.75 KB to 140 KB per disk side 16 KB of which is used by filesystem overhead {{and a copy of}} DOS, on a DOS 3.3-formatted disk, leaving 124 KB for user programs and data. DOS 3.3 is, however, not backward compatible; it cannot read or write DOS 3.2 disks. To address this problem, Apple Computer released a utility called [...] "MUFFIN" [...] to migrate Apple DOS 3.2 files and programs to version 3.3 disks. Apple never offered a utility to copy the other way. To migrate Apple DOS 3.3 files back to version 3.2 disks, someone wrote a [...] "NIFFUM" [...] utility. There are also commercial utilities (such as Copy II Plus) that can copy files from and to either format (and eventually ProDOS as well). Release 3.3 also improves the ability to switch between Integer BASIC and Applesoft BASIC, if the computer has a language card (RAM expansion) or firmware card.|$|E

40|$|Track-aligned extents (traxtents) utilize disk-specic {{knowledge}} to match access patterns to {{the strengths of}} modern disks. By allocating and accessing related data on <b>disk</b> <b>track</b> boundaries, a system can avoid most rotational latency and track crossing overheads. Avoiding these overheads can increase disk access eÆciency by up to 50 % for mid-sized requests (100 { 500 KB). This paper describes traxtents, algorithms for detecting track boundaries, and use of traxtents in le systems and video servers. For large le workloads, a modied version of FreeBSD's FFS implementation reduces application run times by 20 % compared to the original version. A video server using traxtent-based requests can support 56 % more concurrent streams at the same startup latency and buer space. For LFS, 44 % lower overall write cost for track-sized segments can be achieved...|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{algorithm}} that minimizes the expected cost of indirect bina-ry search for data with non-constant access costs (e. g. disk data). The term " indicates that sorted {{access to the}} data is obtained through an array of pointers to the raw data. One immediate application of this algorithm {{is to improve the}} retrieval performance of disk databases that are indexed using the sux array model (also called pat array). We consider the cost model of mag-netic and optical disks and the anticipated knowledge of the expected size of the subproblem produced by reading each <b>disk</b> <b>track.</b> This information is used to de-vise a modied binary searching algorithm to reduce overall retrieval costs. Both an optimal and a practical algorithm are presented, together with analytical and some experimental results, showing that standard binary search can be improved by 50...|$|E

Their abstracted view of storage components hides useful device-specific characteristics, such as <b>disk</b> <b>track</b> boundaries and advanced built-in firmware algorithms.

With automatic adaptation to device characteristics, Lachesis simplifies manual configuration and restores optimizer assumptions about the relative costs of different access patterns expressed in query plans.

In addition, Lachesis simplifies manual configuration and restores the optimizer's assumptions about the relative costs of different access patterns expressed in query plans. Experiments using IBM DB 2 I/O traces as well as a prototype implementation show that Lachesis improves standalone DSS performance by 10 % on average.

40|$|We are {{analyzing}} {{storage structures}} {{for two and}} three dimensional raster type data which are used for feature retrieval. The features are one, two or three dimensional objects with regular outlines like a rectangle or a prism. The features could be parts of a map or image, an area of special interest for searching after oil, a sequence of ultra sound images, and so on. The storage medium is magnetic disk. The data are stored in chunks or blocks representing {{a regular part of}} the source object. We analyze the shape and the size to minimize the cost of retrieval. The optimization is based on minimum time to do retrieval. We have five combinations: Lines and areas from areas and volumes, and volumes from volumes. The optimal block sizes for random retrieval varies, with case, feature size and disk characteristics. One general observation is that longer disk tracks gives larger blocks. For line retrieval the optimal block size is only depending on <b>disk</b> <b>track</b> length. For other cases it is a [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} several years, the range and power of {{information}} technologies has expanded dramatically. In this chapter, we examine in some detail optical technology, hypertext, and the marriage of the two—interactive multimedia. Each provides powerful tools for accessing and delivering information spanning diverse media. In concert, these technologies underlie a set of new “cognitive enhancers ” that may significantly alter {{the manner in which}} teachers teach and students learn. Optical Technologies Perhaps our first acquaintance with optical technology was the compact disc, or CD, that brought noise-free music into our living rooms. These 12 -centimeter (4. 72 -inch) shiny silver disks, introduced in the 1980 s, have rapidly advanced in the consumer market. Both CDs and their larger siblings, videodiscs, hold information that is read by a light beam generated by a low-intensity laser—thus, their designation as “optical” technologies. How does that work? The Basics of the Technology Standard computer storage media like hard disks and floppies store information magnetically; variations in magnetism along each <b>disk</b> <b>track</b> are interpreted as strings of 0 s and 1 s. The traditional audio cassette tape is also a magnetic medium. Optical media store information in the form of pits and lands burned into tracks on the reflective surface of a disc. When the narrow, concentrated light beam from the laser strikes the surface of the optical disc, the reflected light varies in intensity, depending on whether all the ligh...|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} three year, 18 epoch, VLBI {{monitoring}} study of H 2 O masers in the sub-parsec, warped, accretion disk within the NGC 4258 AGN. Our immediate goals are {{to trace the}} geometry of the underlying <b>disk,</b> <b>track</b> rotation via measurement of proper motion, and ascertain the radii of masers for which centripetal acceleration may be measured separately. The monitoring includes ~ 4 times as many epochs, ~ 3 times denser sampling, and tighter control over sources of systematic error than earlier VLBI investigations. Coverage of a ~ 2400 km/s bandwidth has also enabled mapping of molecular material ~ 30 % closer to the black hole than accomplished previously, which will strengthen geometric and dynamical disk models. Through repeated observation we have also measured {{for the first time}} a 5 microarsecond (1 sigma) thickness of the maser medium. Assuming this corresponds to the thickness of the accretion disk, hydrostatic equilibrium requires a disk plane temperature of ~ 600 K. Our long-term goal is a geometric distance to NGC 4258 that is accurate to ~ 3 %, a ~ 2 times improvement over the current best estimate. A geometric estimate of distance can be compared to distances obtained from analysis of Cepheid light curves, with the intent to recalibrate the extragalactic distance scale with reduced systematic uncertainties. This is the first paper in a series. We present here VLBI observations, data reduction, and temporal and spatial characteristics of the maser emission. Later papers will report estimation of orbital acceleration and proper motion, modeling of disk 3 -D geometry and dynamics, and estimation of a "maser distance. " Estimation of a "Cepheid distance" is presented in a parallel paper series. Comment: 22 pages, 16 figure...|$|E
