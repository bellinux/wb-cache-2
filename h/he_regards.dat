5|$|From 1885 {{until his}} death in 1908 his work was {{dominated}} by prose and poems. The 1895 prose text Der Schmetterling contains autobiographical accounts. Peter's enchantment by the witch Lucinde, of whom <b>he</b> <b>regards</b> himself a slave, is possibly in reference to Johanna Kessler. Peter, like Busch, returns to his birthplace. It is similar in style to the romantic travel story that Ludwig Tieck established with his 1798 Franz Sternbald's Wanderungen. Busch plays with its traditional forms, motifs, pictures, literary topics and form of narration.|$|E
5|$|Nielsen {{views the}} brachiopods and closely related phoronids as {{affiliated}} with the deuterostome pterobranchs because their lophophores are driven by one cilium per cell, while those of bryozoans, which <b>he</b> <b>regards</b> as protosomes, have multiple cilia per cell. However, pterobranchs are hemichordates and probably closely related to echinoderms, {{and there is no}} evidence that the latest common ancestor of pterobranchs and other hemichordates or the latest common ancestor of hemichordates and echinoderms was sessile and fed by means of tentacles.|$|E

5000|$|Khomeini studied Greek {{philosophy}} and {{was influenced by}} both the philosophy of Aristotle, whom <b>he</b> <b>regarded</b> as the founder of logic, and Plato, whose views [...] "in the field of divinity" [...] <b>he</b> <b>regarded</b> as [...] "grave and solid". Among Islamic philosophers, Khomeini was mainly influenced by Avicenna and Mulla Sadra.|$|R

5|$|Bede was a Northumbrian, {{and this}} tinged {{his work with}} a local bias. The sources {{to which he had}} access gave him less {{information}} about the west of England than for other areas. He says relatively little about the achievements of Mercia and Wessex, omitting, for example, any mention of Boniface, a West Saxon missionary to the continent of some renown and of whom Bede had almost certainly heard, though Bede does discuss Northumbrian missionaries to the continent. He also is parsimonious in his praise for Aldhelm, a West Saxon who had done much to convert the native Britons to the Roman form of Christianity. He lists seven kings of the Anglo-Saxons whom <b>he</b> <b>regards</b> as having held imperium, or overlordship; only one king of Wessex, Ceawlin, is listed, and none from Mercia, though elsewhere he acknowledges the secular power several of the Mercians held. Historian Robin Fleming states that he was so hostile to Mercia because Northumbria had been diminished by Mercian power that he consulted no Mercian informants and included no stories about its saints.|$|E
5|$|The first {{work that}} Ito {{composed}} after leaving Square was the soundtrack to Culdcept II, which <b>he</b> <b>regards</b> as his best work. He attributes this feeling {{both to the}} fact that it was his first freelance piece and that he handled all aspects of the music production, from composition through arrangement and sound production. From there he returned to working with Square and the Mana series with the remake of his second soundtrack, Final Fantasy Adventure, into the soundtrack of Sword of Mana. It was an act he would repeat two years later for Square, now Square Enix, with the remake of Romancing SaGa, Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song. He has since returned to the Mana series twice, with the soundtracks to Children of Mana and Dawn of Mana. All of the video game soundtracks that he has composed since the third expansion pack for Cross Gate in 2004 have been with the assistance of other composers except for 2007's Hero Must Die, though during those years he has branched out from video games into composing and producing albums and singles for performers as well as composing music for plays and concerts. He has also released an album of piano pieces that he has composed; only two of the eight tracks are from his video game works.|$|E

25|$|Chief Inspector Heat: a {{policeman}} who {{is dealing with}} the explosion at Greenwich. An astute and practical man who uses a clue found {{at the scene of the}} crime to trace events back to Verloc's home. Although he informs his superior what he is planning to do with regards to the case, he is initially not aware that the Assistant Commissioner is acting without his knowledge. Heat knew Verloc before the bombing as Verloc had supplied information to Heat through the Embassy. Heat has contempt for anarchists whom <b>he</b> <b>regards</b> as amateurs, as opposed to burglars whom <b>he</b> <b>regards</b> as professionals.|$|E
25|$|In {{his book}} Human Technology, Lee asserts {{that people should}} become more {{self-sufficient}} in their own health care. Citing what he believes to be modern civilization's over-reliance on pharmaceuticals and specialized health care, he encourages people to rediscover what <b>he</b> <b>regards</b> as natural means of health maintenance, such as the traditional Asian methods discussed in the book, including acupressure and moxibustion.|$|E

25|$|Professor John Bellamy Foster, a sociologist, {{questioned}} whether the resurgence had been truly Keynesian in character. He suggested those few economists <b>he</b> <b>regards</b> as genuinely progressive, such as James Galbraith, were now far from the centre of government. He also asserted that it is Karl Marx, not Keynes, that society should look to for a full solution to economic problems.|$|E
25|$|On Europe, Hitchens {{argues that}} the United Kingdom should {{negotiate}} an amicable departure from the European Union, whose laws and traditions <b>he</b> <b>regards</b> as incompatible with the laws and liberties of Britain, and with the national independence of the United Kingdom as a whole. Likewise, he opposes the Human Rights Act (which incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law) and the European Court of Human Rights.|$|E
25|$|He {{was in a}} {{relationship}} with a lawyer, Bilge Öztürk, for seven years until they amicably parted in 2008. He has told the media that <b>he</b> <b>regards</b> the institution of marriage as outdated, stating he would only get married for the benefit of any children he might have.

25|$|His first double century (204*) was for Mumbai {{while playing}} against the visiting Australian {{team at the}} Brabourne Stadium in 1998. He is the only player to score a century on debut in all three of his {{domestic}} first-class tournaments (the Ranji, Irani, and Duleep Trophies). Another double century was an innings of 233* against Tamil Nadu in the semi-finals of the 2000 Ranji Trophy, which <b>he</b> <b>regards</b> {{as one of the}} best innings of his career.|$|E
25|$|In verses {{five and}} six, Mazaraki gives his verdict on the property. He notes {{the absence of}} bird song, which <b>he</b> <b>regards</b> as a very bad sign. In verse six the doctor declares: “If no birds are heard/death reigns here./My advice is that we depart this place quickly/so off I go”. The doctor mounts up {{and returns to the}} city in verse seven, {{accompanied}} by Stampfer, Gutmann, and Barnett. Only Salomon “with his prophetic eyes” remains behind to spend the night on that hill, we are told in verse eight.|$|E
25|$|The Concord (Mass.) Public Library {{committee}} {{has decided to}} exclude Mark Twain's latest book from the library. One {{member of the committee}} says that, while he does not wish to call it immoral, he thinks it contains but little humor, and that of a very coarse type. <b>He</b> <b>regards</b> it as the veriest trash. The library and {{the other members of the}} committee entertain similar views, characterizing it as rough, coarse, and inelegant, dealing with a series of experiences not elevating, the whole book being more suited to the slums than to intelligent, respectable people.|$|E

25|$|Kitsikis {{regards the}} Greek {{language}} as {{the cornerstone of}} planetary civilization, and he thus deems it an honour for one {{to be able to}} write in Greek. He believes that the treatment of the language should be taken {{out of the hands of}} Greek philologists who are currently destroying it. He defends the continued use of polytonic Greek, traditional spelling and the freedom to write in any literary tone. <b>He</b> <b>regards</b> as erroneous only the implementation of a Greek form not used from the time of Homer to today.|$|E
25|$|Montgomery {{is author}} of over 235 works, {{including}} over one hundred scholarly journal articles and more than fifty books in eight languages. <b>He</b> <b>regards</b> his Tractatus Logico-Theologicus as the most comprehensive presentation of his theology and apologetic method. Articles and essays have appeared in periodicals such as Bibliotheca Sacra, Christian Century, Concordia Theological Quarterly, Ecclesiastical Law Journal, Eternity, Fides et Historia, Interpretation, Journal of the American Scientific Affiliation, Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society, Law and Justice, Library Quarterly, Modern Reformation, Muslim World, New Oxford Review, Religion in Life, Religious Education, Simon Greenleaf Law Review.|$|E
25|$|For Gavin Langmuir, anti-Judaism is {{concerned}} with exaggerated accusations against Jews which nonetheless contain a particle of truth or evidence, whereas antisemitism reaches beyond unusual general inferences and {{is concerned}} with false suppositions. Thus Langmuir considers the labelling of Jews as 'Christ-killers' is anti-Judaic; accusations of well-poisoning, on the other hand, <b>he</b> <b>regards</b> as antisemitic. In his view, anti-Judaism and antisemitism have existed side by side from the 12th century onwards and have strengthened each other ever since. The blood libel {{is another example of}} antisemitism, though it is based in distorted notions of Judaism.|$|E
