40|$|This paper {{studies the}} role of {{investment}} specific technological changes in economic fluctuations in Japan. Following Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Huffman (1998) and Fisher (2006), we model a consumption <b>goods</b> <b>producing</b> <b>sector</b> and an investment <b>goods</b> <b>producing</b> <b>sector,</b> and consider technological changes that are common to the two sectors {{as well as one}} that is specific to the latter sector. We evaluate each shock's role using two approaches. In the first approach, we extend the model of Hayashi and Prescott (2002) by incorporating investment specific technological changes. This model is calibrated to the Japanese economy. In the second approach, we estimate an SVAR model with sign restrictions (Uhlig 2005) in which the restrictions are derived from implications that are common to competing major dynamic general equilibrium models incorporating investment specific technology shocks. The first exercise suggests that investment specific technological improvements sustained the potential growth rate of the Japanese economy in its “lost decade. ” The second exercise shows that investment specific technology shocks are at least as important as neutral technology shocks in Japan’s business cycles...|$|E

40|$|In {{the late}} fall of 1993 the Austrian Statistical Central Office {{published}} the revised National Income Accounts {{for the years}} from 1988 to 1992. In a second step, the Austrian Institute of Economic Research adapted its quarterly estimates concerning the development during each year to the yearly benchmarks. According to the revised accounts, real GDP growth in 1990 reached 4. 2 percent, in 1991 2. 7 percent, 0. 4 and 0. 3 percentage points lower than the previous estimates. For the year 1992, the rate of 1. 6 percent was 0. 1 percentage points higher than the preliminary estimate. From 1987 to 1992 real GDP growth was 17. 6 percent, compared to 18. 1 percent according to the old calculations. Growth in the <b>goods</b> <b>producing</b> <b>sector,</b> construction, and {{wholesale and retail trade}} was revised downwards, while growth in the other service sectors was revised upwards. This revision does not affect the interpretation of the cyclical development of the economy. The upswing that set in at the beginning of 1988 slowed down markedly at the turn of 1990 / 91 (as measured by the year-on-year growth rates). Growth in real GDP finally turned negative during the first three quarters of 1993. The economic slump was particularly deep in the <b>goods</b> <b>producing</b> <b>sector.</b> There, the upswing leveled off during the first three quarters of 1992 and negative rates of change were recorded starting with the fourth quarter of 1992. The construction and wholesale and retail sectors posted strong gains until the summer of 1992, but suffered significant losses after that. The demand for other services, for transport, communications, and finance, insurance and real estate, in particular, remained stable. For several years now the communications sector has been expanding vigorously and net production in the banking sector has recovered from the setback of 1992.

40|$|This paper studies {{patterns}} {{of technological change}} under two scenarios. In Scenario I, a distorted government {{is open to the}} influence of producers' collective action, while in Scenario II a benevolent government operates to maximize national income. The paper draws attention to the role that institutional arrangements and asymmetries in sectoral technology absorption play in shaping the path of technological change. Simulation results are threefold. First, biased institutions under Scenario I might help drag the economy towards the right trajectory, with current generations experiencing welfare loss. Secondly, the benevolent government under Scenario II supports the path of capital-augmenting technological change, which is also supported by the distorted government only when institutions deliberately favor the investment <b>goods</b> <b>producing</b> <b>sector.</b> Thirdly, sectoral asymmetries in technology assimilation do not help industries overcome disadvantageous situations in the political market, and hence do not in�uence the direction of technological developments. ...|$|E

We calibrate a model of the U.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we re-evaluate the {{hypothesis}} that the development of the financial sector is an essential factor behind economic growth in 19 th century Germany. We apply a structural VAR framework to a new annual data set from 1870 to 1912 that was initially recorded by Walther Hoffmann (1965). With respect to the literature, the distinguishing characteristic of our analysis is the focus on different sectors in the economy and the interpretation of the findings {{in the context of a}} two-sector growth model. We find that all sectors are affected significantly by shocks from the banking system.

40|$|The {{role played}} by labor differentiates the service sector from the <b>goods</b> <b>producing</b> <b>sector.</b> Will Baumol argued that in the goods sector labor is {{primarily}} an instrument, an incidental requisite to the attainment of the final product, while in the service sector, labor is itself the end product. One sector {{is assumed to be}} technically progressive, the other static. Over time, an ever larger fraction of labor must be employed in the static sector. The share of the workforce employed in the service sector rose from 51 per cent in 1950 to 76 per cent in 1990. It is claimed that technical progress has historically exhibited a goods bias. The increasing importance of services must ultimately inhibit the rate of growth for the economy as a whole. Output per hour, X/H, is a valid measure of labor productivity if employee hours are homogeneous. But labor is heterogeneous. Productivity is a function of worker characteristics, sex, age (a proxy for experience), and education. When the composition of employee hours is adjusted for changes in these human capital, supply side variables, an employee hour today is 18. 19 per cent more productive than an hour supplied by a worker in 1950. On the demand side, employers can affect productivity by varying the effort intensit...|$|E

40|$|Austria's {{labor market}} {{recovered}} remarkably fast from the dramatic plunge in employment {{and from the}} record unemployment {{in the first quarter}} of 1996. This development supports the view that the economic slowdown in the fourth quarter of 1995 and the first quarter of 1996 is due rather to short-term disturbances than to a premature end to the business cycle. At the international level, such disturbances were mainly caused by synchronous fiscal austerity policies, and at the national level, the propensity of the construction industry to concentrate all of the idle time in the winter months. As the economy emerges from this seasonal trough, a regional analysis of the labor market reveals a repetition of last year's cyclical pattern, though transformed by the cyclical transition from a boom in intermediary products (inventory cycle) to a boom in investment goods. The traditional locational advantages of the close linkage of western Austria's final <b>goods</b> <b>producing</b> <b>sector</b> to neighboring countries are now complemented by new growth factors: the growing functional independence of the peripheral zones of the eastern region (Lower Austria, Burgenland), the categorization of Burgenland as an Objective 1 area, and the bare beginnings of successful restructuring in Styria. Employment losses in tourism, labor shedding in many traditional service industries, as well as restructuring in consumer goods industries, however, continue to depress the Austrian labor market.

40|$|Can investment-specific {{technology}} (IST) shocks explain two of {{the international}} business cycles puzzles- the consumption/output anomaly and the international co-movement puzzle?

In contrast to the existing IRBC models with IST shocks, I find that the aggregate neutral technology shocks are relatively more important in explaining the positive cross-country correlation in output. This is mainly because of the sectoral factor re-allocation effects arising from technology shocks in a two-sector model. IST shocks increases the cross-country correlations in labor input and investment. Trade in investment goods increases the cross-country correlation...|$|R
40|$|Many {{third world}} oil {{producers}} are encountering serious problems in {{building up a}} diversified export base, while West European oil and gas producers (Netherlands, United Kingdom) are suffering a decline in their traded goods (manufacturing) sector induced by real wage pressures. It is becoming increasingly clear that high but temporary oil revenues may be somewhat ora mixed blessing, the quip of The Economist notwithstanding. The mechanism behind this unbalance is clear enough: part of the oil revenues is spent on non-traded goods {{which leads to a}} real appreciation (i. e., a rise in the relative price of non-traded goods in terms of traded goods). This in turn draws resources out of the non-oil traded sector into the non-traded <b>goods</b> <b>producing</b> <b>sector</b> (Corden and Neary (1982); van Wijnbergen (1980)). One may say that this is an efficient response to the increase in income from oil production, the United Kingdom (Mexico, Egypt, [...] .) simply should move into oil derived industries and non-traded goods and forget about their manufacturing sector until oil reserves are exhausted. However, many developing countries are hesitant to take this advice: after all the post-World War II success stories in economic development involve without exception countries that promoted their traded goods sector aggressively. Moreover, it is a well-established 'stylised fact' that technological progress is faster in the traded non-sheltered sectors of an economy than in the non-traded sector (Balassa (1964) is an early reference). Considering the hypothesis that technological progress, rather than taking place exogenously with the passage of time, is a function of accumulated experience, the concern of countries like Egypt, Mexico or Indonesia is much easier to understand.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I propose {{to use the}} I 0 tables to {{investigate}} {{the extent to which}} employment in the marketed services is due to the demand for agricultural and industrial goods. The term industry as it is used in this paper includes the construction industry. The matter is of some topical interest, because in recent years agricultural employment in Ireland has been falling, industrial employment has been roughtly static and only employment in the service sectors has been rising (Conniffe and Kennedy, 1984, p. 11). This pattern is by now well recognised and is common to most, if not all, countries which have attained a moderate degree of industrialisation. It has led to the coining of the term "deindustrialisation" and the widespread acceptance of the belief that increases in employment in the future are likely to take place in the service sector if they happen at all. Yet service sector employment has received surprisingly little attention at either the practical or theoretical level (Conniffe and Kennedy, 1984, p. 201). In particular, there has been little done to discover how much of the employment in the service sector is traceable to final demand, and how much to the demand for services as an imput to other sectors. By attempting to tackle this problem one hopes {{to gain a better understanding}} of the way in which service sector employment is generated. Three specific questions are posed in this paper, namely: (A) How much of the employment in the Irish marketed services in 1975 was traceable to the final demand for the output of the <b>Goods</b> <b>Producing</b> <b>Sector</b> (GPS) ? - (B) Is there any evidence that the pattern revealed in A above is changing over time? - (C) Does a similar investigation for the other EEC countries shed any light on the situation in Ireland...|$|E
40|$|In 1994 {{earnings}} in Austrian manufacturing recovered markedly {{according to the}} revised methods used by the Austrian Institute of Economic Research to compile cash-flow statistics. Cash-flow rose by 12 percent; the ratio between cash-flow and turnover increased from 9 percent to almost 10 percent. Preliminary estimates for 1995 indicate that this favorable development will continue. A growth rate in the cash-flow of 15 percent and a ratio of cash-flow to turnover exceeding 10 percent are very likely. The revised cash-flow statistics are based on balance sheet data as collected by the Austrian National Bank (OeNB). The OeNB's balance sheet statistics {{provide the basis for}} Austria's collaboration with the OECD and the EU Commission in the area of balance sheet analysis for macroeconomic purposes. The main advantage of the new cash-flow concept is that it has been worked out jointly with all important producers and users of balance sheet data, and is compatible with the principles of the EU standard. Thus the new concept ensures a high degree of national as well as international comparability of equity resources in Austria's manufacturing sector at the micro and macro levels. Earnings were high in almost all branches of manufacturing in 1994. The basic <b>goods</b> <b>producing</b> <b>sector</b> benefited the most from the economic recovery. The relation between cash-flow and turnover surged from 6. 4 percent to 8. 5 percent. Markedly higher earnings were also recorded for the chemical industry (9. 5 percent compared to 8 percent in 1993). In the processing and engineering industries the relation between cash-flow and turnover rose from 9 percent in 1993 to 9. 8 percent in 1994. In the branches producing building materials this ratio increased from 13. 5 percent to 14 percent; thus, these industries had by far the highest potential of financing investment out of equity resources. The opening of the border to the East and structural deficits continued to be the main factors {{standing in the way of}} an improvement in {{earnings in}} the traditional consumer industries; the relation between cash-flow and turnover stagnated at last year's level of 9. 5 percent.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the linkages between foreign direct investment, informal sector and transfer of {{environmentally sound technology}} (EST) in a developing economy {{in terms of a}} three-sector, full-employment general equilibrium model with an informal <b>sector</b> that <b>produces</b> a non-traded input for the formal final <b>good</b> <b>producing</b> <b>sector.</b> The same input is produced by another division of the formal sector, which generates less pollution than the informal sector since the former uses a different type of capital that embodies EST. The formal sector has to pay a penalty {{in the form of a}} production tax for using the output of the excessively polluting informal sector. In this scenario, the analysis finds that foreign capital inflow in the formal sector may accentuate pollution, even if it involves transfer of EST. Secondly, there might exist a positive relationship between pollution and national income in the economy both in the presence and absence of transfer of EST. These results can at least question the desirability of transfer of EST and also give theoretical explanations behind the existence of a positively sloped segment in the Environmental Kuznets Curve. ...|$|R

40|$|One {{debilitating}} {{feature of}} the existing literature on the development dynamics of Kerala economy is the undue emphasis on endogenous factors. The making of the `Kerala model' {{as well as its}} crisis are sought to be understood in a closed economy framework. While the emphasis on endogenous factors, particularly on the redistributive policies, is eminently justifiable, what is conspicuously missing in the literature is an effort to unravel the mystery of the general backwardness of the <b>goods</b> <b>producing</b> <b>sectors.</b> This is particularly true of the studies on the crisis of the regional economy since the mid seventies. Given the closed economy perspective, neither the migration nor the remittance has figured in the analytics of development of the region. The mainstream approach has been one of treating the boom in remittance as a boon, with no bearing on the crisis except that it helped moderate the adverse impact of the same. Given the extreme dependence of the regional economy on rest of the world, the present study approaches the problem in an open economy perspective and bring the question of migration and remittance to its rightful place within the structure of the regional economy. Drawing insights from the Dutch disease economics, the present paper argues that the crisis of the commodity <b>producing</b> <b>sectors</b> witnessed during the period since mid seventies could be attributed to the resource movement and spending effect associated with remittance boom. The study also highlights a revival in the growth of the regional economy since the mid eighties and makes an attempt to account for the same in terms of different factors including the adaptation of the regional economy to the Dutch disease environment. ...|$|R

Fragmentation refers to the breaking-up of vertically integrated production processes into various components. We find empirical evidence of fragmentation in a number of data sources. Data on inward processing trade indicate that production in the Irish electronics industry is globally fragmented, and that the scale of such fragmented production is growing. Furthermore, Ireland’s share of fragmentation is rising faster than that in the EU generally, especially in the electronics industry. Other firm survey data show that the scale of local fragmentation has risen relative to global fragmentation as firms in different Irish intermediate <b>goods</b> <b>producing</b> <b>sectors</b> trade increasingly on the local Irish market. Looking more specifically at the computer manufacturing sector, we find evidence of fragmented production in this sector in that the ratio of bought-in materials to total sales has risen significantly over the past decade.

It is labor-intensive, but does require the importation of certain equipment such as kilns. Most of <b>goods</b> <b>produced</b> by this <b>sector</b> is exported to the United States.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focused on}} developing new econometric methods that have practical {{implications for the}} accurate modelling and forecasting of macroeconomic and financial time series. The first chapter investigates changes in {{the factor structure of}} the U. S. economy. To do this a two-step Markov-switching static factor estimation procedure is developed and applied to a well-studied U. S. macroeconomic data set. Strong evidence for Markov-switching in the factors processes, with switching variances being most dominant, is found. The results suggest that regime-dependent factor processes are the main explanation for the diverging number of estimated factors in empirical applications and questions the global linearity assumption implicit in large dimensional factor models of the U. S. economy. The second chapter proposes alternative Heteroskedasticity and Autocorrelation Consistent (HAC) estimators with improved finite sample properties. This is achieved by exploiting existing transformations from the related Heteroskedasticity Consistent estimator literature. Monte Carlo simulation results provide strong evidence in favour of using these alternative estimators to construct standard error estimates instead of the traditional OLS residual-based estimator. In an empirical application to forecasting exchange rates it is shown how different inference from using the alternative HAC estimators can be important, not only from a statistical perspective, but also from an economic one as well. The third chapter introduces a test of symmetry for a stationary time series based on the difference between the dispersion above the central tendency of the series with that below it. The test has many attractive features: it is applicable to dependent processes, it has a familiar form, it can be implemented using regression, and it has a standard Gaussian limiting distribution under the null hypothesis of symmetry. The finite sample properties of the test are examined via Monte Carlo simulation and suggest that it is more powerful than competing tests in the literature for the DGPs considered. The test is then used to investigate business cycle asymmetry in U. S. nonfarm payroll data by sector. The results confirm previous findings that asymmetry is more often detected in <b>goods</b> <b>producing</b> <b>sectors</b> than service <b>producing</b> <b>sectors...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{theory is}} {{developed}} of labor migration that is {{prompted by a}} desire to avoid "social humiliation. " In a general equilibrium framework it is shown that as long as migration can reduce humiliation sufficiently, migration will occur even between two identical economies. Migration increases the number of individuals who choose to perform degrading jobs and consequently, migration lowers the price of the <b>good</b> <b>produced</b> in the <b>sector</b> that is associated with low social status. Moreover, thegreater an individual's aversion to performing degrading jobs, {{the more likely it is}} that he will experience a welfare gain when the economy opens up. ...|$|R
