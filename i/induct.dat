At that ceremony, International Olympic Committee President, Juan Antonio Samaranch, pointed out that rugby's history and values were very much in tune with the Olympic philosophy and traditions.

5|$|As of 2012, {{a maximum}} of four players can be {{inducted}} in one year but {{the greatest number of}} players ever inducted in a year was 23, in 1963. They were inducted because the Hall of Fame was trying to <b>induct</b> many pre-NHL era players. Sometimes noted as 1962 inductees, the pre-NHL era players were named at the 1962 Hall of Fame luncheon at the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE), but were inducted one year later, in 1963 at the CNE. 232 of the player inductees are Canadian-born, while 16 European-born players have been inducted. The NHL team with the most player inductees is the Toronto Maple Leafs (previously the Toronto St. Patricks and Toronto Arenas), with 60. Seventy-seven defencemen are in the Hall of Fame, more than any other current position, while only 36 goaltenders have been inducted.|$|E

5|$|In 1964, the ACLU {{opened up}} a major office in Atlanta, Georgia, {{dedicated}} to serving Southern issues. Much of the ACLU's progress in the South was due to Charles Morgan, Jr., the charismatic leader of the Atlanta office. He was responsible for desegregating juries (Whitus v. Georgia), desegregating prisons (Lee v. Washington), and reforming election laws. The ACLU's southern office also defended African-American congressman Julian Bond in Bond v. Floyd, when the Georgia congress refused to formally <b>induct</b> Bond into the legislature. Another widely publicized case defended by Morgan was that of Army doctor Howard Levy, {{who was convicted of}} refusing to train Green Berets. Despite raising the defense that the Green Berets were committing war crimes in Vietnam, Levy lost on appeal in Parker v. Levy, 417 U.S. 733 (1974).|$|E

5|$|On 2 March 2007, {{the first}} {{consignment}} of two small-batch-production (SBP) aircraft {{arrived in a}} dismantled state in Pakistan. They flew {{for the first time}} on 10 March 2007 and took part in a public aerial demonstration during a Pakistan Day parade on 23 March 2007. The PAF intended to <b>induct</b> 200 JF-17 by 2015 to replace all its Chengdu F-7, Nanchang A-5, and Dassault Mirage III/5 aircraft. In preparation for the in-flight refuelling of JF-17s, the PAF has upgraded several Mirage IIIs with IFR probes for training purposes.

5|$|Consumers {{purchased}} 1.5million {{copies of}} Ninja Gaiden and Black to August 2007, with {{the bulk of}} these sales going to North America and Europe. According to the NPD Group, in its first month Ninja Gaiden sold 362,441copies in the United States. By August 2006, Ninja Gaiden had sold 550,000 copies and earned $27 million in that country. Between January 2000 and August 2006, it was the 100th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube consoles in the United States. Combined sales of Ninja Gaiden and Black reached 800,000 units in the United States by August 2006. These sales figures reflect Tecmo's decision to target the non-Japanese market. Japanese gamers were not particularly excited—according to Itagaki, only 60,000copies of Ninja Gaiden were sold in Japan in the four months following its release. The critical and commercial successes of Ninja Gaiden have led CNET and GameSpot Asia to <b>induct</b> the game into their halls of fame.|$|E
5|$|In his post-baseball career, Day {{worked as}} a {{bartender}} in Newark before returning to his hometown in Baltimore in 1970, where he held a position {{as a security guard}} until 1979. Before Day's death in 1995, there were numerous efforts to celebrate his career and <b>induct</b> Day into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, a long-time dream of his. One such effort was made by Mayor Kurt Schmoke who declared January 31, 1992, Leon Day's Day in Baltimore. Governor William Donald Schaefer made a similar proclamation for Annapolis later that same year on May 10. Day's discreet demeanor and humble personality often understated his several accomplishments, most likely leading to him being overlooked by the Baseball Hall of Fame's voting committee. After falling short one vote of being inducted in 1993, Day was elected to the Hall of Fame on March 7, 1995. Six days later, Day died of heart failure while in hospice at St. Agnes Hospital in Baltimore; he was 78 years old.|$|E

5|$|Originally, {{the goal}} of the Wall of Fame was to <b>induct</b> the {{greatest}} players in Phillies and Athletics history; however, exceptions have been made for non-players who have made significant contributions to the organization. Mack, the Athletics' first inductee, had an 11-year playing career in the National League and the Players' League, but is most remembered for his managerial career, and was honored as such on the Wall. Members have been inducted for contributions in more than one area; Paul Owens, inducted in 1988, spent 48 years {{as a member of the}} Phillies organization, contributing as a scout, manager, general manager, and team executive. The Phillies have inducted four first basemen, four second basemen, five third basemen, three shortstops, one utility infielder, three catchers, 21 outfielders, 18 pitchers, seven managers, one general manager, one coach, two team executives, and two sportscasters.

5|$|The Class of 2005, {{the inaugural}} inductees into the Hall of Fame {{did not have}} a formal {{induction}} ceremony; as a result, they received their medals at a later time. A private gathering was conducted for the Class of 2006, in which inductees received their medal. Beginning with the Class of 2008 on June 7, 2008, a ceremony has been conducted to formally <b>induct</b> the inductees. There were no inductees in 2007 due to the planning of an international expansion to the NWA. On June 7, 2008, the Class of 2008 was inducted into the Hall of Fame. Ric Flair, a member of the Class of 2008 and a World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) employee {{at the time of the}} ceremony, was inducted on October 4, 2008 after his WWE contract had expired; his WWE contract prevented him from appearing in other organizations.

5|$|The Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame is a {{collection}} of plaques, mounted on a brick wall in the Ashburn Alley section of Citizens Bank Park, the ballpark of the Philadelphia Phillies. From 1978 to 2003, the Phillies inducted one figure from their franchise history and one notable person from the Philadelphia Athletics (A's) organization each yearwith the exception of 1983, when the Phillies inducted their Centennial Team. Once Veterans Stadium closed in 2003, the wall plaques used to recognize the Phillies' members were moved to Citizens Bank Park; however, the Phillies no longer <b>induct</b> notable Athletics. Each person inducted into the Wall of Fame was honored with a metal plaque showing the person's face; their position with, and years of service to, the team; and a summary of their most important contributions. In March 2004, the Athletics' plaques were relocated to the Philadelphia Athletics Historical Society in Hatboro, Pennsylvania, and a single plaque listing all of the A's inductees was attached to a statue of Connie Mack located across the street from Citizens Bank Park.|$|E
