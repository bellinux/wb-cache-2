5000|$|Chaplin {{disliked the}} {{unpredictable}} weather of Chicago, and left after {{only one year}} for more money and more creative control elsewhere. His departure caused a rift between founders Spoor and Anderson. Chaplin was the studio's biggest moneymaker, and Essanay resorted to creating [...] "new" [...] Chaplin comedies <b>from</b> <b>file</b> <b>footage</b> and out-takes. Finally, with Chaplin off the Essanay scene for good, Essanay signed French comedian Max Linder, whose clever pantomime was often compared to Chaplin's. Linder failed to match Chaplin's popularity in America. In a last-ditch effort to save the studio, Essanay joined in a four-way merger orchestrated by Chicago distributor George Kleine in 1918. Kleine's new combine, V-L-S-E, Incorporated, was an amalgam of the Vitagraph, Lubin, Selig, and Essanay companies. Only the Vitagraph brand name continued into the 1920s, and was absorbed by Warner Brothers in 1925.|$|E
5000|$|Smith {{has become}} {{well known in}} recent years {{for her role as}} Amanda Young in the Saw films. She has been called a [...] "scream queen" [...] due to the number of horror films in which she has appeared. In the DVD {{commentary}} of Saw, the producers revealed that her scenes were filmed while she was battling a terrible case of the flu. It was revealed in the DVD commentary of Saw II that she was four months pregnant with her second child during filming. Her pregnancy was kept a secret from everyone except director Darren Lynn Bousman. He mentioned in the commentary that Smith's daughter Verve accidentally told him about the pregnancy during filming. She has said that although she is briefly shown in Saw IV and Saw V, she was never on set. Any scenes featuring her were dubbed <b>from</b> <b>file</b> <b>footage.</b> On March 20, 2009, producer Mark Burg released a statement confirming that Smith would be in Saw VI. She arrived in Toronto on March 31, 2009, to begin filming new flashback sequences.|$|E

25|$|Technological {{advancement}} is also {{changing the}} ways news is gathered and edited. The newsreel days are long gone. Reporters {{do not use}} film anymore. Television journalists are capturing images and sound on video and DV. Some stations even begin gathering and reporting news in high-definition television.

He's also made it acceptable for {{people to go to}} the movie theatre and watch documentaries. I hate to say it but we're all children of Michael Moore." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1976, the films' owner, MCA, {{made the}} unusual {{decision}} {{to turn over}} ownership {{of all of the}} newsreels to the National Archives. The decision effectively ended Universal's copyright claim, releasing the films into the public domain. Because royalties no longer have to be paid in order to broadcast them, Universal Newsreels have become a popular source of <b>file</b> <b>footage</b> in recent years. The History Channel made them {{a key part of the}} TV series Year-By-Year. Also, C-SPAN and CNN regularly use the films for video of events that took place before those networks were founded.|$|R
5000|$|Besser {{refrained from}} imitating Curly or Shemp. He {{continued}} to play the same whiny character he had developed over his long career. He had a clause in his contract prohibiting being hit excessively. Besser recalled, [...] "I usually played the kind of character who would hit others back". He claimed that Larry volunteered to take the brunt of Moe's screen abuse. In a 2002 E! channel program which used <b>file</b> <b>footage</b> of Besser, the comic stated that {{the left side of}} Larry Fine's face was noticeably coarser than the other side, which he attributed to Moe's less-than-staged slaps.|$|R

International news agency Reuters had on August 10 admitted it had wrongly captioned video it took from Russia’s Rossiya Television and which it had disseminated worldwide, London’s Guardian reported. The agency, the daily reported, had admitted: it had “mistakenly identified this <b>file</b> <b>footage</b> as originating <b>from</b> the Arctic, and not the North Atlantic where the footage was shot.

Just go to a rehearsal; she usually stays to the end of those." [...] The scandal became notorious as the [...] "Rome Walkout". Callas brought a lawsuit against the Rome Opera House, {{but by the time the}} case was settled thirteen years later and the Rome Opera was found to be at fault for having refused to provide an understudy, Callas's career was already over.|$|R
5000|$|Stock footage, and similarly, archive footage, library pictures, and <b>file</b> <b>footage</b> is film {{or video}} footage {{that can be}} used again in other films. Stock footage is {{beneficial}} to filmmakers as it saves shooting new material. A single piece of stock footage is called a [...] "stock shot" [...] or a [...] "library shot". Stock footage may have appeared in previous productions but may also be outtakes or footage shot for previous productions and not used. Examples of stock footage which might be utilized are moving images of cities and landmarks, wildlife in their natural environments, and historical footage. Suppliers of stock footage may be either rights managed or royalty-free. Many websites offer direct downloads of clips in various formats.|$|R
50|$|While {{attending}} the U.S. Open tennis tournament in New York City in September 1995, Jane Bronstein, who is rather large and disfigured from childhood polio and a thyroid condition, was pictured in CBS <b>file</b> <b>footage</b> <b>from</b> the tournament. Although the footage was {{never intended to}} be shown to the public, {{a few seconds of}} it was shown during a segment on the Late Show with David Letterman. The footage showed Bronstein devouring a peach {{in a matter of seconds}} and then handing the peach pit to a man seated beside her with a horrified look on his face. Although the audience and Letterman's fans found the clip hilarious, Bronstein and her attorney Harvey Rothberg were not amused and sued for damages in February 1996. The case was settled in March 1997 for undisclosed terms.|$|R
5000|$|Kam Williams {{reviewing}} the DVD in AALBC.com described {{the film as}} [...] "excellent". He notes, [...] "The directors were clever enough to contrast all this graphic present-day content intermittently with some tame <b>file</b> <b>footage</b> <b>from</b> stock Sexual Education films which probably passed as state-of-the-art instruction back in the Fifties." [...] According to him, these interludes, which he labels as [...] "antiseptic", [...] "humorous", and [...] "amusing", are [...] "a welcome reminder of how far we've come {{from the days of}} learning about the birds and the bees in clinical presentations by a nervous nerd in a white lab coat {{standing in front of a}} blackboard with a pointer." [...] MaryAnn Johanson, writing in Flick Filosopher, asserts that it is the openness of the interviewees, not the nudity, which is significant.|$|R

5000|$|A {{short time}} after {{announcement}} of the polar expedition, some newspapers tried to stir up controversy by claiming the expedition was fake {{because some of the}} footage was from James Cameron's movie Titanic. A Russian television network had used the Titanic footage (for which it holds the copyright) as an illustration of the deep-sea vessels in action. They had shown this hours before the Mir submersibles had arrived on the Arctic seabed, and they had pointed out that the footage was from the movie, not a transmission from the site. Reuters did not note this information when it carried the story, and used the pictures wrongly captioned. Reuters later apologized and issued a statement reading in part: [...] "Reuters mistakenly identified this <b>file</b> <b>footage</b> as originating <b>from</b> the Arctic, and not the North Atlantic where the footage was shot", and they reposted the story with correct captions.|$|R

He played Arizona rancher-pilot Schuyler [...] "Sky" [...] King, who fought bad guys and rescued people with his {{airplane}}. Early villains were bank robbers and kidnappers; some later foils were Russian spies and saboteurs. Sky's first airplane was a Cessna T-50 (known among pilots as the [...] "Bamboo Bomber" [...] because of its wooden wings), and later a much more modern Cessna 310B. Sky's airplanes were named [...] "Songbird". Sky and his niece Penny, played by Gloria Winters, lived on the [...] "Flying Crown Ranch". The series called for Grant to wear the same outfit in each episode. This was a common practice {{in the early days}} of television: the series regulars in Adventures of Superman and Dragnet, for example, always wore the same outfits so different episodes could be filmed at the same time, and <b>file</b> <b>footage</b> could be added to new footage without anyone noticing.|$|R
