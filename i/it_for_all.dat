5|$|In 1943, McNair took an axe to {{the armored}} {{division}} organization, dramatically downsizing <b>it.</b> <b>For</b> <b>all</b> but the 2nd and 3rd Armored Divisions, {{the number of}} armored battalions was reduced to three. Devers favored the older, larger organization. The surplus armored battalions were utilized as separate armored battalions, so {{by the end of}} 1943 there were 54 armored battalions in armored divisions and 65 non-divisional battalions. By this time, the planned number of Army Ground Force divisions had been dramatically cut to 90, and McNair considered that only ten armored divisions were required, and he suggested that six of the sixteen armored divisions already active be broken up. This proposal was not accepted, and the number of armored divisions was frozen at sixteen.|$|E
5|$|One {{alternative}} was the turbo-electric drive where the steam turbine generated electrical power which then drove the propellers. This was particularly favoured by the US Navy, which used <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> dreadnoughts from late 1915â€“1922. The advantages {{of this method}} were its low cost, the opportunity for very close underwater compartmentalization, and good astern performance. The disadvantages were that the machinery was heavy and vulnerable to battle damage, particularly the effects of flooding on the electrics.|$|E
5|$|The name of {{the roller}} coaster comes from the story of Hercules in Greek Mythology. According to the story, Hercules had to perform twelve labours. After {{defeating}} the Nemean lion for the first labour, the second was to defeat the Hydra, a nine-headed creature with eight serpentine heads that would regrow each time they were cut off, including one that was immortal. Dorney Park altered {{the remainder of the}} story- after Hercules managed to defeat the Hydra initially, he buried the immortal head stuck under a stone, with the intention of sealing <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> time. Years later however, the head slowly grew back, resurrecting the Hydra and taking its revenge on Hercules by killing him; hence why the Hydra roller coaster sits where Hercules once did.|$|E

25|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{recommends}} {{routine vaccination}} only if a country can keep more than 80% of people vaccinated.

Either one or two doses of the vaccine is recommended. In the United States two doses are recommended starting at twelve to fifteen months of age.

25|$|Consecration to the Virgin Mary by Roman Catholics {{has taken}} place from three perspectives, namely personal, {{societal}} and regional; and generally in three forms: to the Virgin herself, to the Immaculate Heart of Mary and to the Immaculata. In Catholic teachings, consecration to Mary does not diminish or substitute the love of God, but enhances <b>it,</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> consecration is ultimately made to God. Pope Leo XIII, specially encouraged everyone to make acts of consecration to the Virgin Mary based on the methods of Saint Louis de Montfort. Pope Benedict XV also provided strong support for Marian consecration.|$|E
25|$|Kempe's {{argument}} goes as follows. First, if planar regions separated by the graph are not triangulated, i.e. {{do not have}} exactly three edges in their boundaries, we can add edges without introducing new vertices {{in order to make}} every region triangular, including the unbounded outer region. If this triangulated graph is colorable using four colors or fewer, so is the original graph since the same coloring is valid if edges are removed. So it suffices to prove the four color theorem for triangulated graphs to prove <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> planar graphs, and without loss of generality we assume the graph is triangulated.|$|E
25|$|The {{governing}} Liberal and National Coalition {{chose not}} to contest the by-election, as Werriwa had long been considered a safe Labor seat; Labor has held <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> but nine years since 1906. Nevertheless, the by-election received substantial public attention, due to both the surprise nature of Latham's resignation and a brutal Labor preselection battle between two potential candidates. This resulted in the drafting of a compromise candidate, industrial mediator Chris Hayes. Labor increased their margin with 55.4 percent of the primary vote and 70.1 percent of the two-candidate-preferred vote. All of the 15 remaining candidates received a primary vote of less than 10 percent.|$|E

IEC 60906-1 has been proposed as a common standard for all 230 V plugs and sockets worldwide but has been adopted only in South Africa so far, with a modified version used in Brazil.

On 5 August 1480 (or 1481), Pope Sixtus IV extended it to all churches {{of the first and}} second orders of St. Francis for Franciscans. On 4 July 1622, Gregory XV extended the privilege to all the faithful, who, after confession and the reception of Holy Communion, visited such churches on the appointed day. On 12 October 1622, Gregory XV granted the same privilege to all the churches of the Capuchins. Pope Urban VIII granted <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> churches of the regular Third Order on 13 January 1643, and Clement X for all churches of the Conventuals on 3 October 1670.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, Republican voters control {{most of the}} state, {{especially}} in the more rural and suburban areas outside of the cities; Democratic strength is mostly confined to the urban cores {{of the four major}} cities, and is particularly strong in the cities of Nashville and Memphis. The latter area includes a large African-American population. Historically, Republicans had their greatest strength in East Tennessee before the 1960s. Tennessee's 1st and 2nd congressional districts, based in the Tri-Cities and Knoxville, respectively, are among the few historically Republican districts in the South. Those districts' residents supported the Union over the Confederacy during the Civil War; they identified with the GOP after the war and have stayed with that party ever since. The first has been in Republican hands continuously since 1881, and Republicans (or their antecedents) have held <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> but four years since 1859. The second has been held continuously by Republicans or their antecedents since 1859.|$|E

British Railways chose Gill Sans {{as the basis for}} its standard lettering when the railway companies were nationalised in 1948. Gill Sans also soon became used on the modernist, deliberately simple covers of Penguin books, and was sold up to very large sizes which were often used in British posters and notices of the period. Gill Sans was one of the dominant typefaces in British printing in the years following its release, and remains extremely popular: it has been described as [...] "the British Helvetica" [...] because of its lasting popularity in British design. Gill Sans has influenced many other typefaces, and helped to define a genre of sans-serif, known as the humanist style.|$|E

[...] He used such techniques with the Pixies: Doolittle's [...] "Dead" [...] begins with Santiago's guitar [...] "squawking" [...] on an E-flat like [...] "a wounded animal". As Santiago was learning the guitar, he saw himself as a self-conscious amateur, and still speaks of a lack of confidence in his playing.|$|E
