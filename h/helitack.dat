5|$|The forest {{maintains}} a full-time fire staff throughout the summer, {{not only to}} control and extinguish fires that pose threats to people and structures but also to set controlled burns. Their jobs include maintaining {{a high level of}} preparedness, keeping a vigilant lookout for fire activity, responding to reports of fires, maintaining equipment, monitoring weather and relative atmospheric dryness, and preparing daily fire activity reports, which are used to post fire information for visitors and staff. The forest has wildland fire engines, pumps, hand tools and fire hose at its disposal. A helicopter can be summoned quickly, along with support from the South Central Idaho Interagency Dispatch Center, including a team of smokejumpers and air tankers used to provide air support in dropping flame retardant and water. There are small areas around Stanley and Mount Harrison where aerial retardant would not be used {{in the case of a}} fire. The 10-member Sawtooth <b>Helitack</b> crew was established in 1963 and is based at Friedman Memorial Airport in Hailey. In the case of larger fires, the National Interagency Fire Command can quickly mobilize available resources. Only four of the original fire lookout towers remain standing in the forest, but they are no longer in use: Iron Mountain, Horton Peak, Lookout Mountain, and Mount Harrison, which was last fully staffed in 2007. Many of these towers were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression.|$|E

5000|$|The term <b>helitack</b> first {{appeared}} in a 1956 Los Angeles Times article, which described the [...] "first {{of a series of}} tests—tabbed the <b>Helitack</b> Program—on the use of helicopters in firefighting will start next week in the San Bernardino National Forest". The word itself is a portmanteau of [...] "helicopter" [...] and [...] "attack".|$|E
50|$|The use of helicopter-delivered fire {{resources}} {{varies by}} agency. Often, <b>helitack</b> crews perform duties {{similar to other}} initial attack crews. Two or three firefighters will be dispatched to a newly reported fire. <b>Helitack</b> crews are usually used for initial attack on fires that are difficult for other firefighters to access, or on extended fires that require aerial support {{in the form of}} water drops, cargo delivery, crew shuttling, or reconnaissance. A typical initial attack response by a <b>helitack</b> crew involves flying to the fire via helicopter and spending one to three days (although sometimes much longer) putting the fire out before hiking to the nearest road for pickup.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Helitack</b> {{crews are}} often {{considered}} to be elite members of the firefighting community, {{partly because of the}} experience levels required to qualify as a crew member. CDF Captain Jim Barthol, {{in an interview with the}} San Diego Union-Tribune, used the analogy of runners in a race to compare <b>helitack</b> with other handcrews. He said that [...] "ground-based hand crews are marathon runners, while <b>helitack</b> crews work more like sprinters. Other hand crews might spend three days or more fighting a fire, we might work three different incidents in one day. It doesn't necessarily make us better than those other guys. It just makes us different." ...|$|E

50|$|In 1977 Cal Fire began {{a two-week}} pilot <b>helitack</b> program {{utilizing}} a contracted helicopter. Headed up by Captain Emil Derdowski and two firefighters, {{the program was}} eventually extended {{to a total of}} four weeks. The success of this pilot program brought on line the Hemet-Ryan <b>Helitack</b> Base using a full-time contract helicopter staffed with three captains and nine firefighters operating out of Ryan Air Attack Base.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Helitack</b> {{refers to}} [...] "helicopter-delivered fire resources", {{and is the}} system of {{managing}} and using helicopters and their crews to perform aerial firefighting and other firefighting duties, primarily initial attack on wildfires. <b>Helitack</b> crews are used to attack a wildfire and gain early control of it, especially when inaccessibility would make it difficult or impossible for ground crews to respond in {{the same amount of}} time.|$|E

5000|$|When CAL Fire {{began to}} develop a <b>helitack</b> program in 1970, {{it was decided that}} <b>helitack</b> bases would be {{established}} in areas where they could most easily protect high-value timberlands and critical watershed areas in northern and central California. [...] Subsequently two bases were created for Mendocino County and the surrounding area to protect the high-value timber industry in this region. Starting in 1972, the first was located at Laytonville Fire Station, with call sign Copter 101. The second was an Evergreen contract Bell 205A1 (50 Romeo) starting in 1977 at CDF's Howard Forest Fire Station near the town of Willits, California, with call sign of Copter 100. Copter 100 performed the first rope rapelling at Howard Forest, and demonstrated the value and function of the Medium Helicopter for California firefighting. In 1981, Laytonville <b>helitack</b> moved and Copter 101 established at its current location at Howard Forest; Copter 100 and its <b>helitack</b> crew was disbanded. Laytonville's helipad and fueling facilities are still maintained as a secondary base and mid-mission refueling location.|$|E

50|$|As {{a result}} of the accidents, CAL FIRE decided that better {{approach}} would be for the agency to own and operate its own helicopters. In 1981, CAL FIRE leased 12 excess UH-1F Hueys which had previously been used by the USAF in Vietnam. Nine helicopters were initially reconditioned, and were operated as non-certificated, public-use aircraft. The first helicopter was built up November, 1981 and was placed in service at Hemet-Ryan <b>Helitack</b> Base. Six more F Model Hueys were built up and placed in service at <b>helitack</b> bases throughout California in the summer of 1982. During the first two years CAL FIRE employed “Personal Service Contract” pilots. Each base was assigned a full-time pilot and a seasonal relief pilot who covered two bases. The majority of the contract pilots became state employees in 1984. The <b>helitack</b> unit was designed to be a cohesive unit which consisted of the helicopter and <b>helitack</b> crew. A typical configuration for the helicopter was a <b>Helitack</b> Fire Captain in the copilot's seat and a <b>Helitack</b> Fire Captain plus six fire-fighters in the passenger compartment. The water bucket was replaced in 1984 with a newly designed Canadian 324-gallon Bambi bucket. In the mid-1980s, fixed water dropping tanks were installed on several helicopters. Water bucket operations over ever-increasing populated regions in the urban interface areas of eastern Riverside County had been causing a concern. An accidental drop of a water bucket could cause catastrophic results, while a fixed tank reduced the exposure. In addition, some areas where the helicopters operated had few water sources from which a helicopter could fill its bucket. A fixed tank allowed the helicopter to obtain water from sources previously unobtainable with the bucket.|$|E

50|$|The California Department of Forestry began {{experimenting with}} <b>helitack</b> as a doctrinal concept in 1960, when {{a crew of}} three firefighters was {{deployed}} on an Alouette III helicopter.|$|E
50|$|The <b>helitack</b> crews use {{the same}} tools on the fire lines as other ground crews do, {{including}} chain saws, axes, shovels and a specialized, two-headed cutting tool known as a Pulaski.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>helitack</b> {{helicopter}} {{will launch}} {{with a crew}} on board, drop them {{in the vicinity of}} the fire (or [...] "incident") where they will begin clearing a firebreak with standard hand tools, while the helicopter can then support the team with water drops, either with a Bambi bucket or airframe-mounted water tanks, or ferry in additional personnel (e.g., hotshot crews). If the fire continues to grow beyond the initial attack phase, the mission of the <b>helitack</b> crew shifts to a support role, locating and operating at helispots and helibases, where the coordination of the support required for other firefighting helicopters.|$|E
5000|$|In 1960 the Division of Forestry {{decided to}} {{experiment}} with a small, skilled initial attack, or [...] "helitack" [...] crew to be transported by helicopter to increase the early arrival of manpower and equipment to an initial attack fire. Although the crews were trained for hover jumping and had purchased heli-jump suits from the US Forest Service, it was never found necessary to make a jump. Six <b>helitack</b> bases were established in the early 1970s. They were staffed with contracted Bell JetRangers. A typical CAL FIRE <b>helitack</b> crew which responded with the helicopter consisted of one fire captain and two to three seasonal firefighters.|$|E
50|$|Much of the <b>helitack</b> crews' {{training}} {{centers on}} helicopter safety, as the crews typically load and unload with the rotors turning, {{and sometimes in}} very rough terrain, where only the skid on one side can be touched down.|$|E
50|$|In a {{situation}} where terrain or vegetation height {{make it impossible for}} a helicopter to land, <b>helitack</b> methodology can also employ rappellers, rappelling from a helicopter as high as 250 feet above the ground or deplaning crews from a hovering helicopter (heli-jumping).|$|E
50|$|On July 6, 1994, nine {{members of}} a hotshot crew based in Prineville, Oregon, died after being {{overtaken}} by the fast-moving Storm King fire west of Glenwood Springs, Colorado. Five other firefighters, three smokejumpers and two <b>helitack</b> firefighters, also died in the conflagration.|$|E
5000|$|When backfires, or [...] "prescribed burns" [...] {{are needed}} in remote areas, <b>helitack</b> {{helicopters}} {{can be used to}} start them, using a [...] "helitorch", a driptorch suspended on a cable under the helicopter, or by dropping plastic sphere dispenser (PSD) ignition devices.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} few hours of the fire, four CAL FIRE firefighters from the Boggs Mountain <b>helitack</b> crew {{suffered}} second-degree burns while engaging in initial attack on the fire.

5000|$|July 6, 1994 - While {{fighting}} the South Canyon Fire on Storm King Mountain, near Glenwood Springs, Colorado, two <b>helitack</b> firefighters and 12 other firefighters were killed {{as they tried}} to flee the fire after it [...] "spotted" [...] beyond the fireline and began to race up the steep, densely vegetated terrain towards them.|$|E
50|$|September 13, 2004 - While {{fighting}} {{a fire in}} the Stanislaus National Forest in northern California, seven members of a CDF <b>helitack</b> crew were engulfed in the flames when the wind shifted in their direction.
