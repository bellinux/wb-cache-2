25|$|Furthermore, {{the cold}} winter {{temperatures}} prematurely halted fermentation in the cellars, leaving dormant yeast cells that would awaken <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> spring and start fermenting again. One of the byproducts of fermentation is {{the release of}} carbon dioxide gas, which, if the wine is bottled, is trapped inside the wine, causing intense pressure. The pressure inside the weak, early French wine bottles often caused the bottles to explode, creating havoc in the cellars. If the bottle survived, the wine was found to contain bubbles, something that the early Champenois were horrified to see, considering it a fault. As late as the 17th century, Champenois wine makers, most notably the Benedictine monk Dom Pérignon (1638–1715), were still trying to rid their wines of the bubbles.|$|E

In contrast, Kecal's character [...] that of a self-important, pig-headed, loquacious bungler [...] is instantly established by his rapid-patter music. Large suggests that the character may have been modelled on that of the boastful Baron in Cimarosa's opera Il matrimonio segreto. Mařenka's temperament is shown in vocal flourishes which include coloratura passages and sustained high notes, while Jeník's good nature is reflected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> his music, generally in the G minor key. For Vašek's dual image, comic and pathetic, Smetana uses the major key to depict comedy, the minor for sorrow.

A coin of Nerva (reigned AD 96–98) acknowledges Rome's dependence on the princeps' gift of frumentio (corn dole) to the masses.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study was to {{identify}} the functional significance of conflicting stereotypes and to identify <b>the</b> dominant category <b>in</b> such conflicts. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> present research we examined the conflicting crossed-categories of age and wealth with regard to warmth and competence perceptions. It was found (Pilot Study and Study 1) that the old-rich targets presented a conflicting stereotype group <b>in</b> <b>the</b> perception <b>of</b> <b>warmth,</b> whereas young-poor targets presented a conflicting stereotype group <b>in</b> <b>the</b> perception of competence. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> old stereotype dominated <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> evaluation <b>of</b> old-rich targets, whereas the poor stereotype dominated the competence evaluation of young-poor targets. In Study 2, participants provided warmth and competence evaluations after they learned about the targets’ behaviors which demonstrated high or low warmth and high or low competence. The results suggest that for <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old-rich target the category that did not match the behavior (i. e., contradicted the stereotype expectation) was more salient and drove judgments. However, the effect of stereotype expectation violation was not found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> competence evaluation of the young-poor target.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{questions}} regarding the impact of maternal chronic pain on children were addressed in this dissertation. Firstly, the physical and psychosocial functioning of 39 mothers suffering from chronic pain was compared to 35 control healthy mothers {{in order to determine}} the extent to which mothers with chronic pain may be compromised and their children may be at risk. It was found that mothers with chronic pain had decreased physical, mental and social functioning, as well as reduced parenting efficacy. Secondly, the children of these mothers were compared on a range of physical and psychosocial health outcome measures. <b>The</b> 55 children <b>in</b> <b>the</b> maternal chronic pain group experienced maladjustment, as reported by children, mothers and fathers. This included reduced physical and mental health compared to the 48 control children, as well as reduced attachment security and social skills. Thirdly, although a number of maternal psychosocial variables, such as maternal mental health were correlated with child functioning, only one variable – parenting - consistently emerged as a significant predictor of child problems. <b>In</b> particular, <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mother-child relationship, and the mother's use of over-reactive discipline strategies were significant mediators. The findings reflect that maternal chronic pain is a source of risk for many children. Consistent with much of the maternal chronic stressor literature, the mechanism of transmission from physical compromise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mother to maladjustment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> child appears to largely involve dysfunctional parenting practices. The findings are discussed <b>in</b> terms of <b>the</b> cost of maternal chronic pain to children and society. In particular, intervention needs to be targeted at suffering mothers and their children. This will reduce the deleterious consequences for children and the potential demands of a new generation of sufferers on the public health system...|$|R
5|$|The {{presence}} of a semi-permanent high-pressure area known as the North Pacific High <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eastern Pacific is a dominant factor against formation of tropical cyclones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> winter, as the Pacific High results in wind shear that causes environmental conditions for tropical cyclone formation to be unconducive. Its effects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> central Pacific basin are usually related to keeping cyclones away from the Hawaiian Islands. Due to westward trade winds, hurricanes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific nearly never head eastward, although several storms have defied the odds and headed eastward. A second factor preventing tropical cyclones from forming during the winter is the occupation of a semi-permanent low-pressure area designated the Aleutian Low between January and April. Its presence over western Canada and the northwestern United States contributes to the area's occurrences of precipitation in that duration. In addition, its effects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> central Pacific near 160°W causes tropical waves that form <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area to drift northward into the Gulf of Alaska and dissipate. Its retreat <b>in</b> late-April allows <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pacific High to meander in, bringing its powerful clockwise wind circulation with it. The Intertropical Convergence Zone departs southward <b>in</b> mid-May permitting <b>the</b> formation of the earliest tropical waves, coinciding with {{the start of the}} eastern Pacific hurricane season on May15.|$|R
