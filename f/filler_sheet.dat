40|$|Barrier paper, {{which is}} made of {{bleached}} absorbent kraft pulp, is a significant layer of decorative laminates, since it controls the see-through of brown color of saturating kraft paper and its opacifying effect usually is achieved by a heavy loading of TiO 2. The TiO 2, due to its very small particle size, passes between the cellulosic fibers and drains into the white water. To overcome this problem, papermakers try to use various retention aids for improving overall retention of TiO 2, but agglomeration of TiO 2 causes a decrease in light scattering efficiency of TiO 2. During the subsequent saturation operation, {{the air in the}} voids is replaced by melamine formaldehyde, which has a refractive index close to that of cellulose. As a result, the sheet becomes translucent and poses 'see through' problem. Keeping this in view, anhydrous magnesium silicate is used as an extender with TiO 2 because it effectively increases the overall <b>filler</b> retention, <b>sheet</b> brightness, opacity. The dispersed aqueous slurry of anhydrous magnesium silicate forms fine gel that entraps TiO 2 in the wet web and prevents removal of fines and fillers. The addition of 25 % TiO 2, 7 % micronized soapstone powder, 8 % anhydrous magnesium silicate, 1 % melamine formaldehyde, and 0. 1 % sodium hexameta-phosphate was found to improve the overall retention by 65. 25 % and to cut the manufacturing cost by US$ 546. 00 per tonne of pulp without affecting the product quality...|$|R

Throughout their development, there has often been a challenging issue how one can uniformly distribute nanoparticles (NPs) in a polymer matrix, avoiding their agglomeration. In this short review, we first introduce the theory of colloidal aggregation/gelation purely based on intense shear forces. Then, we illustrate a methodology for preparing polymer nanocomposites where the NPs (as fillers) are uniformly and randomly distributed inside a matrix of polymer NPs, based on intense shear-driven aggregation of binary colloids, without using any additives. Its feasibility has been demonstrated using two stable binary colloids composed of (1) poly-methyl methacrylate fillers and polystyrene NPs, and (2) graphene oxide <b>sheets</b> (<b>fillers)</b> and poly-vinylidene fluoride NPs.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to clarify the role of {{external}} fibrillation in pulp and paper properties. If the degree of external fibrillation could be controlled {{and the role of}} external fibrillation were known, this would provide better possibilities for utilizing the full potential of fibrous material. External fibrillation caused by refining is inevitable, but its role has not been clearly explained, because conventional refiners produce a variety of simultaneous effects, such as internal fibrillation, external fibrillation, straightening or curling of fibers and fines formation. Therefore, a special type of refiner was required for evaluating the specific role of external fibrillation. An ultra-fine friction grinder consisting of two grinding stones was found to overcome the limitation related to conventional refiners. Using the grinder, it was possible to promote external fibrillation while keeping the internal fibrillation and curl constant. An increase in external fibrils attached to fibers was found to increase the retention of <b>filler</b> during <b>sheet</b> forming in a high-vacuum dewatering device. Promoting the degree of external fibrillation contributed to strengthening the bonding layer between fibers, resulting in improved tensile strength and internal bond strength. Recycling reduced fiber swelling and paper strength, but for externally fibrillated fibers this loss was restored by refining more than for internally fibrillated fibers, even beyond the swelling and strength of the nonrecycled fibers. Increasing external fibrillation alone was found {{to play an important role}} in fiber and paper properties, so it can be used as means to control those properties more effectively. reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{describes}} {{the preparation of}} lignin filled natural rubber latex composite and its subsequent use to obtain lignin modified rubber. Two types of lignin i. e. : rubber wood and commercial alkali lignin were used as rubber <b>filler.</b> Gum rubber <b>sheets</b> were prepared from the lignin modified rubber and their properties were compared to Standard Malaysian Rubber (SMR 20) and a type of rubber obtained from the coagulation of high ammonia latex. Rubber morphology was investigated using Scanning Electron Microscope on the cross-sectional area of cryo-fractured samples. Oil resistance of the rubber sheets was determined by measuring the mass change before and after ASTM IRM 903 oil immersion, while the tensile strengths were determined according to ASTM D 412 standard. Low values of tensile strength obtained for the commercial alkali lignin modified rubber sheet relative {{to the rest of}} the rubber samples was attributed to poor lignin dispersion. This occurrence was substantiated by the SEM analysis of cryo-fractured samples where crazes and inhomogeneity was observed. Nonetheless, both lignin modified rubbers exhibited higher level of oil resistance compared to SMR 20. This is due to the nature of lignin as a hydrophilic component and its presence in the rubber matrix complicates the oil diffusion process into rubber. ...|$|R

Effects of ZE content (W-ZE) on the structure and properties of the resultant ZEPU sheets were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, dynamic mechanical analysis, tensile testing, and dissolubility testing in alcohol. The results indicated that cross-linking and grafting reactions occurred between ZE and PUP to form new polyurethane showing a higher thermal stability, flexibility, and alcohol-resistance than the neat ZE sheets. For example, the elongation at break of ZEPU with 50 % W-ZE was 211. 2 %, which was 47 times {{higher than that of}} neat ZE sheet.

40|$|Office {{waste paper}} {{is one of}} the fastest growing {{segments}} of the recycled fiber industry. Toner particles are rigid, insoluble and difficult to disperse and detach from fibers. Therefore papers made from recycled office waste having high toner content will contain noticeable ink particles. This work will consider an alternative way of efficient de-inking using plasma polymers which will not affect the fibers chemically or mechanically. The focus is development and characterization of plasma-deposited films to serve as a barrier film for the adhesion of ink toner to the paper fibers and thereby enhance ink lift off from the fibers. The plasma treated paper is coated with fluorocarbon (PFE) and polyethylene glycol (PFE) films, with constant thickness of PFE and varying the thickness of PEG by 1500, from 1500 to 4500, for the three cases studied (PFE greater than PEG, PFE=PEG, PFE less than PEG). Handsheets were made using virgin fibers to eliminate effects of <b>fillers.</b> Once the <b>sheets</b> were coated and printing performed, they were re-pulped and both the slurry and the de-inking surfactant were placed in a flotation cell. Handsheets were made from the collected foam and stock and were scanned for particle count. The results indicated higher ink loss for the cases with increased thickness of polymer films. A handsheet with a 7500 film (PFE = 3000 and PEG = 4500) showed 61 % ink removal compared to 38 % for handsheets with no film deposited.

Comprehensive experiments were carried out to identify the optimum processing parameters for controlled simultaneous heating of the <b>filler</b> metal and <b>sheets</b> by laser beam resulting in melting of the filler metal without melting Cu and SS sheets. Using this methodology, a number of brazed joints were successfully prepared at different set of processing parameters. The brazed joints were subjected to various non-destructive (visual and dye-penetrant test) and destructive (microscopic examination, energy dispersive spectroscopy, four point bend testing etc.) characterization techniques. The results demonstrated that laser energy per unit length of 100 J/m is threshold limit for feasibility of brazing process for selected metal and thickness combination. Microscopic studies of transverse section of laser brazed joint showed full penetration across the thickness without the melting of parent metals. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy studies showed the diffusion of filler material (Ag) more towards the Cu sheet as {{compared to that of}} stainless steel sheet. Four point bend test showed that the alignment of laser beam-metal joint was critical for the brazing joint strength and improved joint strength was achieved when the beam was at the centre of the brazing joint.

40|$|The thermal {{behavior}} of a low-defect kaolinite fully expanded with hydrazine-hydrate has been investigated {{in a nitrogen atmosphere}} at a constant, preset decomposition rate of 0. 15 mg/min. Under controlled-rate thermal analysis (CRTA) conditions, it was possible to distinguish between loosely bonded (adsorbed) and strongly bonded (intercalated) reagent. The loosely bonded reagent is connected to the internal and external surfaces of the expanded mineral and is present as a space <b>filler</b> between the <b>sheets</b> of the delaminated mineral. The strongly bonded hydrazine-hydrate is connected to the kaolinite inner-surface OH groups by the formation of hydrogen bonds. Based on the thermoanalytical results, three different types of bonded reagent could be distinguished in the complex. Type 1 reagent (approximately 0. 20 mol hydrazine-hydrate/mol inner-surface OH) is liberated between approximately 50 and 70 C. Type 2 reagent is lost between approximately 70 and 85 C, corresponding to a quantity of 0. 12 - 0. 15 mol hydrazine-hydrate/mol inner-surface OH. Type 3 reagent is lost in the 85 - 130 C range, amounting to some 0. 30 mol hydrazine/mol inner-surface OH. The quantity of this third type of reagent is independent of the conditions of sample pretreatment (drying). The liberation of bonded hydrazine-hydrate can be followed by FT-IR (DRIFT) spectroscopy in the OH and NH stretching ranges as well. When the complex is heated to 70 C under CRTA conditions, a new reflection appears in the XRD pattern with a d-value of 9. 6 Å, in addition to the 10. 3 Å reflection. This new reflection disappears in contact with moist air and the complex re-expands to the original d-value of 10. 3 Å.

40|$|In modern papermaking, {{the use of}} {{retention}} aids, which help to effectively incorporate fines and <b>fillers</b> into a <b>sheet</b> of paper, is widespread. Various single, dual and multi-component retention aid systems are available, one example of which is poly(ethylene oxide) and cofactor, the topic of this thesis. The mechanisms by which such systems function are still poorly understood, thus making the optimization of wet-end papermaking a complex problem. Without {{a knowledge of the}} basic mechanisms of these retention aids, costly trial-and-error runs have to be performed. The aim of this thesis is to use Molecular Mechanics (MM) and Semiempirical Molecular Orbital Theories to test the original ideas and theories, postulating that the association of PEO and cofactor is essential for the flocculation of cellulose fibre fines and that the driving force for association is hydrogen bonding. These theoretical methods provide structures and energies not easily obtainable from experiment, and predict properties and interactions that can be tested experimentally. Gas phase calculations, using the PM 3 Semiempirical Molecular Orbital Theory, of the interactions between non-ionic poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO), with three model cofactors, (gallic acid, beta- 1 -O-Galloyl- 3, 6 -(R) -hexahydroxydiphenoyl-D-Glucose (corilagin) and 1, 3, 6 -Tri-O-Galloyl-beta-D-Glucose (TGG)), showed that the delocalised molecular orbitals (DLMO), which describe the bonding between the n-mer (PEO) n and cofactors, cover the complete complexes. The DLMOs which cover R-OH···O or R-CH···O, traditionally considered as hydrogen bonds, show a distinct "pinch", a decrease of the electron density between the H···O atoms. Calculations of Gibbs free energy, entropy and enthalpy show that the PEO/cofactor complexes do not form at room temperature, because the loss of entropy exceeds the increase in enthalpy. Even though bond lengths, bond angles, DLMOs and electron densities for the PEO/cofactor complexes are consistent with the definition of hydrogen bonds, the number of intermolecular R-OH···O and R-CH···O bonds does not correlate with the enthalpy of association of the complexes, indicating that other interactions predominate in the bonding mechanism for this type of system. Moreover this thesis shows that the original idea that the main mechanism of complexation is hydrogen bonding, is incorrect...|$|R
40|$|Many {{grades of}} paper have shifted from acid to {{alkaline}} production conditions. This change excludes {{the usage of}} traditional alum-rosin sizing chemistry. In some cases however, rosin sizing could prove beneficial {{if it could be}} used under neutral to alkaline paper making conditions. One effort toward this goal has been the use of epi-halohydrin modified polyamine/polyaminoamide in place of alum. The optimum sizing conditions, as well as the mechanism that modified polyamines/polyaminoamides use to size rosin, is investigated. Polyethyleneimine modified with epi-chlorohydrin was used in these studies. Rosin dosage was found to be the main variable that controlled the degree of sizing achieved. As the only hydrophobic material added, this was expected. In addition to rosin dosage, the polymer and pH had significant impacts on this sizing chemistry. Laboratory data shows that the synthesis procedure for and structure of polyethyleneimine-epi-cholohydrin (PEI-epi) impacts the degree of sizing achieved. Use of different modification techniques and degrees of modification illustrated several key factory regarding the polymer as a rosin sizing mordant. Prevention or removal of by-products from epi-chlorohydrin imporves the sizing efficiency of PEI-epi with rosin. A critical molecular weight of the PEI-epi was found to be important to sizing. Higher charge density on PEI-epi provides better the sizing efficiency. In addition to the polymer, other important factors where examined. The pH of the stock impacted the degree of sizing and permanency of the sizing achieved. Varying stock pH showed changes in sizing that are consistent with effects seen for rosin retention and of PAE as a wet strength agent. Low and high pH levels also caused reversion of the sizing effect. A pilot trial of the PEI-epi-rosin sizing chemistry was conducted at the Herty Foundation. The pilot trial shows that PEI-epi-rosin can reach the required level of sizing for linerboard. Trial results showed that calcium carbonate filled sheets could be sized by this chemistry. No significant impact on strength is seen from the sizing chemistry at the required dosage levels. As would be expected, addition of <b>filler</b> diminishes <b>sheet</b> strength. No sizing reversion was seen from any samples of this trial. Size reversion at low stock pH indicated that acid catalytic cleavage of an ester bond could have been occurring. Addition of acid or base to permanently sized sheets showed significant levels of reversion, similar to that seen for low stock pH sheets. This provides further supporting eviden ce for the formation and importance of an ester bond between rosin and PEI-epi. FTIR spectra were collected for model compounds to further examine the presence and importance of ester bonds. An ester bond was found to form at room temperature with aging or immediately with drying. Further, the ester bonds were found to decrease when the sample was subjected to acidic or basic environments. Solid state NMR was run to demonstrate the presence and importance of ester bonds to sizing in handsheets. Use of a [superscript 13]C labeled fatty acid showed that the ester bond peak dominated when sizing was present. After treatment with sodium hydroxide, the sizing disappeared and much of the ester bond signal shifted to a carboxylic acid or salt. Further solid state NMR of a non-reactive cationic polymer or a fully pre-reacted PEI-epi polymer shows retention of the fatty acid, but no ester bond and no sizing. The sizing mechanism of PEI-epi-rosin sizing appears to be connected to an ester bond formed during drying or with aging. While the amount of rosin retained controls the degree of sizing, retention alone is not enough to give sizing. The most effective pH for this sizing chemistry is near neutral, pH 6 - 8. FTIR and solid state NMR shows that an epichlorohydrin modified polyamine can form ester bonds with fatty acids in handsheets under conditions comparable to papermaking. The presence of residual acid or base in handsheets destroys the sizing effect achieved. Destruction of the sizing by addition of sodium hydroxide parallels the cleavage of many of the ester bonds present. PEI-epi appears to function as a mordant for rosin by creating an ester bond to anchor and help orient the hydrophobic portion of rosin. Ph. D. Advisor: Yulin Deng, Ph. D. Assoc.

40|$|To {{achieve an}} {{understanding}} and complete {{description of the}} functional properties of three dimensional (3 D) cell culture systems, a large set of parameters is required, which clearly contrasts this cell cultivation approach from traditional two dimensional (2 D), planar cultivation techniques. As an alternative to describe {{the characteristics of a}} 3 D cell culture system by its physicochemical properties (e. g. stiffness, porosit y, level of crosslinking), the behavior of the cultivated cells {{can be used as a}} read-out parameter to characterize the 3 D cultivation system. In this work, the cellular parameters membrane dynamics, actin fiber morphology and migration were used to investigate the differences between classic, planar and a collagen based three dimensional cell culture system Membrane dynamics – assessed by FRAP measurements of CAAX -mCherry – as well as actin formation – visualized by in vitro staining with LifeAct -tagRFP – showed distinct differences when investigated in planar or three dimensional systems. FRAP experiments with CAAX - mCherry showed, that even though the overall membrane composition does not appear to be different, mobility of the membrane is significantl y higher in three dimensional cell culture systems than in two dimensional. A view at the actin cytoskeleton revealed the already established difference: stress fibers and cortical actin are more pronounced in planar cell culture systems compared to cells c ultivated in three dimensional systems. Interestingly, cells originall y seeded in collagen hydrogels which migrated towards the glass surface show features in actin cytoskeleton formation resembling both culture conditions: both, actin stress fibers within the cell body as well as cortical actin are visible in those parts of the cells directly contacting the glass surface. The observed migration towards the glass surface gave rise to the investigation of this behavior. Migration in response to mechanical si gnals is termed durotaxis. Cells cultivated in collagen hydrogels or collagen hydrogels supported by cellulose sheets over a period of time were microscopicall y investigated to determine the distribution of cells. Cell distribution in unsupported collagen hydrogels was clearly in favor of hydrogel regions in close proximity to the glass surface. By applying supporting material in form of cellulose sheets, the cell culture was freely floating in the culture medium, resulting in an even distribution throughout the entire thickness of the cell culture system. As 3 D cell culture systems make it more challenging to perform high quality imaging due to the inherent scattering and loss of intensity with increasing optical penetration, a post imaging processing tool set was evaluated and benchmarked in order to counteract these image corrupting effects and improve the image quality. This in turn also improves the compatibility of cellulose sheets with the commonly used tool set in life sciences: fluorescence microscopy. Special emphasis was put on the identification of a serviceable and performance -linked deconvolution setup. A GPU based CUDA Deconvolution plugin showed the best time performance but ultimately failed to produce the same quality level of image restoration as the three tested CPU based deconvolution applications. Among these three, the commercial HyugensPro software showed the best results in terms of increasing the contrast. The Iterative Deconvolution 3 D plugin comes close to producing comparable results to the HuygensPro software, however, the time consumption for this application is up to 10 times larger. Finally, the plugin Deconvolution Lab showed reasonably satisfying results in terms of image restoration quality, while performing deconvolution slightly faster than HuygensPro. Finally, cellulose sheets are used for the cultivation of cells in 3 D as an example of for paper as a versatile platform for the development of functional devices. Therefore a method is required that delivers spatially resolved, quantitative, sensitive, and, most importantly, also dynamic measurements. Optical microscopy has long been recognized as a method to characterize the heterogeneous and complex structure of paper. With fluorescence detection, the functionality has even been extended to provide chemical selectivity, e. g. to determine the distribution of secondary modifications like coatings and <b>fillers</b> throughout a <b>sheet</b> of paper. Here it is shown that quantitative widefield and confocal fluorescence microscopy are versatile methods to meet this set of demands. Confocal microscopy was used to achieve a detailed view of the interface between a hyd rophobic and rhodamine labeled polymer and a FITC labeled dextran solution. Furthermore, confocal microscopy revealed that the spatial propagation of the FITC labeled dextran solution occurs along the surface of the cellulose fibers, instead of the inter -fibers space.
