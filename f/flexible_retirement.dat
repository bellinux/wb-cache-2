40|$|Abstract. Human capital theory {{predicts that}} older workers {{are less likely}} to {{participate}} in on-the-job training than younger workers, due to lower net returns on such investments.

Finally, the results suggest that in most European countries training can keep older workers longer in the labour market. 1...|$|R

40|$|<b>Flexible</b> <b>retirement</b> - that is, the {{opportunity}} to choose oneÃ¢â¬â¢s own personal retirement age - serves as a hedge against pension risk and provides insurance to workers facing health or productivity shocks. This paper discusses three conditions to provide insurance through <b>flexible</b> <b>retirement.</b> <b>Flexible</b> <b>retirement</b> and flexible pension schemes are in practice closely linked because of imperfect capital markets and institutional restrictions. First, {{it should be possible}} to adjust the pension starting date at limited cost. This condition is gradually being fulfilled, as many countries are moving towards more actuarially neutral pension schemes. Second, individuals should be willing to adjust their labour supply in case of a wealth shock. This condition seems largely fulfilled, although the available empirical evidence suggests that the framing of pension wealth is at least as important as the income effect. Third, the labour market should be able to deal with flexible individual retirement decisions. This condition is gaining importance, but has not yet received much attention in the literature. Institutions often hamper employment past the ‘standard retirement age’. Moreover, the hiring rates of older workers are low and their unemployment duration is high. Institutional reforms facilitating <b>flexible</b> <b>retirement</b> opportunities are desirable from an insurance perspective. ...|$|E

30|$|Our results {{challenge}} the traditional model of full-time work and timely retirement, {{and suggest that}} flexible work arrangements (either full- or part-time) later in life may have significant well-being benefits. We hope that these results will inform the discussion about {{the potential benefits of}} <b>flexible</b> work and <b>retirement</b> arrangements, both in terms of fiscal burdens and the well-being of citizens. In addition to the administrative and implementation costs, changing employment and retirement schemes and allowing more labor market flexibility will likely have transactions costs, {{at least in the short}} run. For example, both employers and employees may face bargaining costs related to negotiating the flexible work arrangements which are optimal for both sides. Employers may moreover incur additional costs related to restructuring tasks to accommodate part-time work. Yet, the long-run fiscal benefits, as well as those to aggregate well-being – which our results suggest are quite large – make such policy changes worth considering in many countries. While this analysis is limited to Europe and the U.S., it may also have implications for other countries.|$|R

40|$|National {{policies}} in the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany and Belgium show policy shifts towards active ageing and towards flexicurity to enhance flexibility and security in the labour market. The main question is about the practice and implementation of these macro policies on the workplace level. Therefore this chapter presents {{the findings of a}} survey in workplaces in the four mentioned countries in four sectors of industry (N= 3085). A flexicurity approach for senior workers is most visible in the Dutch and Danish workplaces because of a broader range of implemented facilities such as phased <b>retirement,</b> <b>flexible</b> working hours, education and training, in- and external job-job transitions. A flexicurity approach is far less implemented in German and Belgian workplaces. The large cross-national differences are visible in all 4 studied sectors. Examining the usage rates of arrangements, the survey show different strategies addressing the issue of the older workers. The Belgians aim for flexibility in working hours. The Dutch are still focused towards a ‘relief’ strategy (adaptation of workload, tasks and working hours), while the Danish favour an employability policy. The German workplaces show passivity in all items. Further, the investigations reveal cross-sectoral differences. Cross-national differences in initiating actors of flexible arrangements for the senior workers at the workplace can play a role in explaining the observed variance...|$|R

40|$|A major {{strategy}} of recent pension reforms {{has been to}} promote what may be called the «working longer» policy paradigm arguing that working longer represents a win‐win strategy by addressing both the challenge of pension finance sustainability and adequacy. By working longer this extends the contribution period for pensions and reduces the period of pension payments and so helps to balance income and outlays for pensions. Adequacy and social sustainability is improved by increasing the individual earnings basis for future pension benefits and a shorter period in retirement brings higher yearly benefits. The policy measures to bring about these changes are numerous, but {{in this paper we}} will deal with two different ways of bringing the factual pension age upwards, considered to be partial substitutes (OECD, 2011) : The first one is the straightforward solution of rising the normal retirement age (e. g. the UK). The second strategy is more hidden and implicit, and consists of introducing demographic adjustment factors into the system, that via expected behavioural changes will induce potential retirees to postpone their retirement. Norway (and Sweden) introduced a <b>flexible</b> statutory <b>retirement</b> age where a longevity adjustment factor ensures that people get lower pension benefits if the life expectancy of their cohort increases. A third strategy not considered here relies on a demographic factor that automatically increases the retirement age in correlation with population ageing (e. g. Denmark). This paper aims at exploring the pension reform processes in two countries and answer why countries embark on different paths toward extended working life. We also raise some critical issues regarding the consequences the policy design might have for implementation and peoples´ behaviour and adjustment to the new system. We also question the {{strategy of}} automatic stabilizers with respect to information for future pensioners about consequences of different choices and what role street‐level bureaucracies might play in making the implementation of the new pension scheme work according to its intentions, i. e. to make people work longer.

We examine past and future demographic changes in Northern England and their effect on population health, labour force size and household numbers, drawing out implications for public policy. We use new projections for England's local authority (LA) populations by ethnicity from 2001 to 2036. The population of Northern England will grow between 8  % and 12  %, depending on projection scenario. So, aggregate demand {{for goods and services}} in Northern England will continue to increase.

Fiduciary and tax rules. Department of Labor (DOL) fiduciary rules require plan sponsors to conduct a comprehensive credit analysis of any within-the-plan annuity provider, or to hire an independent expert to do so. Under tax rules, plans offering annuity payouts must also provide retirement income estimates and comply with joint and survivor annuity requirements. New generation of solutions. A broad array of retirement income solutions are emerging in the marketplace outside of the qualified plan environment. These innovations include nonguaranteed managed payout funds, flexible annuity contracts, and reverse mortgages. Implications. Sponsors can address participants’ retirement income needs by adding annuities (or other retirement income alternatives) as a distribution option within a defined contribution (DC) plan, or by accommodating their use “outside the plan. ” In the case of annuity options in particular, ERISA fiduciary rule may pose an obstacle to their widespread adoption as a within-plan solution. Meanwhile, many retirement income innovations are occurring outside of the qualified plan system. Retirement income strategies can also be incorporated into participant education and advice programs.
