25|$|Given {{the results}} of the trial, it <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>not</b> {{surprising}} that the project was scrapped almost immediately over safety concerns. However, it has since been suggested that the entire project was a hoax devised as part of Operation Fortitude, to convince the Germans that plans were being developed to attack the heavily fortified defences surrounding the Pas-de-Calais rather than the less-defended Normandy coastline.|$|E
25|$|Whiteread's casts {{often seem}} to emphasise {{the fact that}} the objects they {{represent}} are not themselves there, and critics have often regarded her work to be redolent of death and absence. Given this, it <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>not</b> surprising that she was asked by Austrian authorities to create a work in remembrance of Austrian Jews killed during the Holocaust. Due to political sensitivities and bureaucracy the process, from commission to unveiling, took five years.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} found that BPO errors (i.e. use of BPO pantomimes in place of the IO pantomimes {{dominant}} in typical adult individuals) are made by patients with schizophrenia. Given that BPO errors are associated with apraxia, and that past research has indicated that schizophrenic patients have apraxia-like symptoms, this <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>not</b> a surprising finding. This BPO-schizophrenia association has not been extensively explored to date, and more research is required in order to better understand it.|$|E

500|$|The danger <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>not</b> {{great if}} the people of one State, through their legislature, decide that Lady Chatterley's Lover goes so far beyond the {{acceptable}} standards of candor {{that it will be}} deemed offensive and non-sellable, for the State next door is still free to make its own choice. At least we do not have one uniform standard. But the dangers to free thought and expression are truly great if the Federal Government imposes a blanket ban over the Nation on such a book. [...] The fact that the people of one State cannot read some of the works of D. H. Lawrence seems to me, if not wise or desirable, at least acceptable. But that no person in the United States should be allowed to do so {{seems to me to be}} intolerable, and violative of both the letter and spirit of the First Amendment.|$|E
500|$|Ward employs symbols {{such as a}} rose, {{which takes}} {{different}} meanings in different contexts: creative beauty for the Girl, an item for purchase for the Elderly Gentleman. [...] The same telephone system that provides the Elderly Gentleman with quick communication is an alienating, isolating symbol for the Boy, as it is beyond his means yet telephone poles are ever-present. [...] Ward displays discontinuous contrasts throughout the book: the Girl stretches herself out nude and carefree in a chapter of her section, while in his the Elderly Gentleman sadly views his worn-out naked form in a mirror. [...] While essentially wordless, via signs and placards the graphics incorporate far more text into the imagery than in earlier works. [...] To wordless novel scholar David Beronä, this shows an affinity {{to the development of}} the graphic novel, even if Vertigo itself <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>not</b> comics; Ward himself was not permitted to read comics in his youth.|$|E
2500|$|Quotienting [...] by [...] has {{the effect}} of setting all Lie {{commutator}}s to zero. One can see this by observing that the commutator of a pair of elements in [...] gives an element in [...] This <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>not</b> immediately obvious: to get this result, one must repeatedly apply the commutation relations, and turn the crank. The essence of the Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem is that it is always possible to do this, and that the result is unique.|$|E

2500|$|There are gay {{and lesbian}} {{communities}} in the cities, particularly in the Paris metropolitan area (such as in Le Marais district of the capital). Although homosexuality <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>not</b> as well tolerated in France as in Spain, Scandinavia, and the Benelux nations, surveys of the French public reveal a considerable shift in attitudes comparable to other Western European nations. As of 2001, 55% of the French consider homosexuality [...] "an acceptable lifestyle." [...] The past mayor of Paris, Bertrand Delanoë, is gay.|$|E
2500|$|With {{respect to}} what he called [...] "the cutting up of the 'timing'", Lacan asked the question, [...] "Why make an {{intervention}} impossible at this point, which is consequently privileged in this way?" [...] By allowing the analyst's intervention on timing, the variable-length session removed the patient's—or, technically, [...] "the analysand's"—former certainty as {{to the length of}} time that they would be on the couch. When Lacan adopted the practice, [...] "the psychoanalytic establishment were scandalized"—and, given that [...] "between 1979 and 1980 he saw an average of ten patients an hour", it <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>not</b> hard to see why: [...] "psychoanalysis reduced to zero", if no less lucrative.|$|E
2500|$|The central {{character}} in the Flaxborough Chronicles, Inspector Walter Purbright, <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>not</b> the most intellectually dazzling detective in fiction. [...] He does, though, provide an unusually solid core of decency and civilisation around which more fanciful and sometimes whimsical events can be strung. [...] His understanding of the case in hand emerges from a process of polite, measured enquiry. [...] Purbright's decency {{is at the heart}} of Watson's thesis: that civilised life depends on basic tolerance, decency and the honesty of its guardians. [...] His commitment to total impartiality, his refusal to be deflected by special interests and social position and his scrupulous refusal to cut procedural corners all go to make up a quintessentially English hero.|$|E

2500|$|In Ancient Greek, {{the name}} of the city was [...] (Athēnai, [...] in Classical Attic) a plural. In earlier Greek, such as Homeric Greek, the name had been current in the {{singular}} form though, as [...] (Athēnē). It was possibly rendered in the plural later on, like those of [...] (Thêbai) and [...] (Μukênai). The root of the word <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>not</b> of Greek or Indo-European origin, and is a possible remnant of the Pre-Greek substrate of Attica, as could be {{the name of}} the goddess Athena (Attic , Athēnā, Ionic , Athēnē, and Doric , Athānā), that was always related to the city of Athens. During the medieval period {{the name of the}} city was rendered once again in the singular as [...] However, after the establishment of the modern Greek state, and partly due to the conservatism of the written language, [...] became again the official name of the city and remained so until the abandonment of Katharevousa in the 1970s, when Ἀθήνα, Athína, became the official name.|$|E
2500|$|Retrospectively, Bruce Eder of AllMusic {{thought the}} album {{contains}} [...] "some {{of the most}} sublimely beautiful musical passages ever {{to come from the}} group, and develops a major chunk of that music in depth and degrees in ways that one can only marvel at, though there's a big leap from marvel to enjoy. If one can grab onto it, Tales is a long, sometimes glorious musical ride across landscapes strange and wonderful, thick with enticing musical textures". In its fortieth anniversary issue from 1992, NME selected Tales from Topographic Oceans as their [...] "40 Records That Captured The Moment" [...] for 1974. In 1996, Progression magazine writer John Covach wrote that it is Tales from Topographic Oceans, not Close to the Edge (1972), that represents the band's true hallmark {{of the first half of}} their 1970s output and their [...] "real point of arrival". He pointed out [...] "the playing is virtuosic throughout, the singing innovative and often complex, and the lyrics mystical and poetic. All this having been asserted ... even the most devoted listener to Tales is also forced to admit that the album is in many ways flawed. Tracks tend to wander a bit ... and the music therefore <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>not</b> as focussed as it might be." [...] He notes that while Howe [...] "set a new standard for rock guitar", he thought Wakeman's parts were not used properly and that the keyboardist was instead [...] "relegated to the role of sideman". Author and critic Martin Popoff called the album one of the [...] "black hole of Yes experiences, the band dissipating, expanding, exploding and imploding all at once", though he thought it contained [...] "some fairly accessible music".|$|E
