40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the main issues of the German {{guideline}} on „Concrete structure in contact with water-contaminating liquids“. The guideline {{can be used for}} the design and construction of concrete structures for containment of hazardous materials such as filling stations, catching basins, industrial floors, storage facilities. The guideline focuses mainly on the <b>fluid</b> <b>tightness</b> of un-cracked concrete structures but supplies also some suggestions how to treat cracked structures. The guideline gives recommendations for the construction materials of new structures and explains strategies for the maintenance and re-pair of containment installations.

40|$|Fibrin sealant and {{platelet}} gels {{are human}} blood-derived, biodegradable, non toxic, surgical products obtained by mixing a fibrinogen concentrate or a platelet rich plasma with thrombin, respectively. Fibrin sealant {{is now a}} well known surgical tool increasingly used to stop or control bleeding, or to provide air and <b>fluid</b> <b>tightness</b> in many surgical situations. Platelet gels are newly developed preparations that are of specific interest because they contain numerous physiological growth factors and cytikines that are released upon the activation of blood platelets by thrombin. These growth factors, including PDGF, TGF- 1, BMP, and VEGF {{have been shown to}} stimulate cell growth and differentiation with special clinical benefits for soft and bony tissue healing and regeneration. Platelet gels allow surgeons to manipulate the cellular environment of surgical sites and to guide tissue regeneration. A specific interest of such products is observed for the induction of osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. Advances in the preparation, clinical use, and safety of these two important classes of blood-derived biomaterials are reviewed...|$|E
40|$|The so far {{achieved}} {{results show}} that laser assisted joining of dissimilar materials is possible for the cases shown above. However the development is still in progress with the aim to improve joint strength and reliability. Moreover, {{it is necessary for}} applications in hybrid microsystems {{to reduce the size of}} joint geometries. In order to understand the processes and bonding mechanism occurring in laser joining the examination of the interfacial region is approached from a materials science viewpoint paying special attention towards mechanical strength and <b>fluid</b> <b>tightness</b> as mentioned above. Further experiments will deal with the application of coupling agents and structuring of the silicon substrate in order to increase the interfacial strength of silicon-polymer joints. Mechanical testing of specimen can give information about the influence of process parameters and changes in materials structure. Finally bonding and interfacial states will be examined with spectroscopic methods (Raman, FTIR, XPS) giving information about the way, how dissimilar materials bond together...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNitric oxide is a {{signaling}} molecule {{that has}} various roles under normal conditions, notably {{in relation to}} vasodilation, neuronal function, and immune responses. Additionally, it has been implicated in some pathological states including multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis is characterized by chronic inflammation and oligodendrocyte and axonal damage and ultimately death of neurons. The precise role of nitric oxide in pathogenesis is confounded by its opposing beneficial and deleterious effects. With respect to multiple sclerosis, increased nitric oxide metabolites have been well documented in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients. Reports on changes in the concentration of nitric oxide in the serum of patients have been inconsistent. Here, we report statistically significant increases in the concentrations of nitric oxide metabolites in the serum of multiple sclerosis patients not under medications from two subpopulations in Iran, supporting contentions that disease status does correlate with nitric oxide levels in this easily accessible body <b>fluid.</b> However, the <b>tightness</b> of the correlation appears to be insufficient {{to allow it to}} be used as an independent surrogate for assessment of disease status...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of a deep water composite production riser from a system perspective is presented, and its advantages are articulated through comparisons with a typical steel riser under identical service conditions. The composite riser joints {{in this study were}} considered {{to be a part of}} a single Tension Leg Platform (TLP) riser string to be installed at a depth of 6000 ft in Gulf of Mexico. A series of numerical analyses ??????burst, collapse, fatigue, global and local ?????? have been performed, and the capacities of the composite riser have been determined utilizing long-term strength properties. The capacities associated with the hoop direction, i. e., burst and collapse, are limited by the presence of a steel internal liner whose function is to ensure pressure and <b>fluid</b> <b>tightness.</b> The collapse capacity of the riser can be drastically impaired by the presence of a debond between the liner and composite. Due to the high strength to weight ratio of the carbon/epoxy composite, its response under combined axial tension and bending moment showed great safety margins, favoring pursuits of greater water depths. The study also constructed damage envelopes associated with axial tension and bending moment, which facilitate feasibility checks for expanding the use of the composite joints to other locations or systems. The fatigue life of the composite body is expected to greatly exceed its design life, and the most critical element is the welds between the liner and metal end pieces. Since there is wide dispersion of S-N relationships for carbon/epoxy composites depending on the combinations of constituent materials, a parametric study was carried out in this study to suggest the range of acceptable S-N relationships. The composite riser is estimated to offer only moderate damping, due primarily to its specially orthotropic lay-up. The study also demonstrates that the use of Rayleigh stiffness proportional damping may not be suitable for deep water risers. A series of forced excitation analyses show that the system in sea water does not show notable resonance due to fluid drag. When compared with the steel riser, vibration amplitudes at low elevations are much lower...|$|E
