40|$|The {{starting}} point for this paper is a fundamental change currently occurring in the way innovation is organised in developed countries: it tended to be centralised at or near headquarters, but is now much more decentralised within the company. Equally if not more significant, innovation activities {{that used to be}} carried out in-house by innovating firms themselves are carried out by <b>independent</b> <b>suppliers</b> of knowledge intensive business services or are transferred to key suppliers. The question driving this paper is how this 'organisational decomposition of the innovation process' changes the global distribution of innovation of activities. Does it contribute to their global dispersal to the developing world or does it strengthen the existing concentration? Since this is uncharted territory, the paper seeks guidance from theory and draws out the insights which can be gained from the innovation systems and Global Value Chain (GVC) perspectives. This then leads to the identification of the new questions which future empirical research needs to address. outsourcing; global distribution; knowledge intensive business services; innovation systems; global value chain; GVC; organisational decomposition; developed countries; <b>independent</b> <b>suppliers.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|Fuel {{cards are}} not all the same and 'shopping around' is advised. Typically, a {{supplier}} will offer {{just one or two}} cards. The user should seek an <b>independent</b> <b>supplier</b> offering a range of cards from major brands, so that the most appropriate fuel card for their individual needs can be chosen. A fuel card with little or no motorway coverage but extensive coverage of metropolitan areas, for example, could be of limited use to a national haulier but ideal for a taxi company. A supplier offering only diesel cards will be of minimal appeal to a fleet manager responsible for a petrol-only or mixed-fuel company car fleet.|$|E

The following autumn The British Motor Corporation acquired Fisher & Ludlow. Fisher & Ludlow supplied Standard-Triumph who were then obliged {{to take control of}} the relatively small Mulliners but that took a few more years to develop and Mulliners was to close at the end of 1960.

40|$|Contrary to {{the seminal}} paper of Horn and Wolinsky (1988), we {{demonstrate}} that upstream firms, which sell {{their products to}} competing downstream firms, do not always have incentives to merge horizontally. In particular, we show that when bargaining takes place over two-part tariffs, and not over wholesale prices, upstream firms prefer to act as <b>independent</b> <b>suppliers</b> {{rather than as a}} monopolist supplier. Moreover, we show that horizontal mergers can be procompetitive, {{even in the absence of}} efficiency gains. ...|$|R

We find that for smaller technology gap with the <b>independent</b> input <b>supplier</b> the firm would outsource and for larger technology gap it would produce the input in-house for itself and for its rivals. The outsourcing occurs in order to take advantage of its sale of superior technology to the <b>independent</b> input <b>supplier</b> at a high payment although it involves a high price for the input to be acquired from the monopoly input supplier. Though the firm gains from strategic outsourcing, consumers’ welfare as well as social welfare goes down. outsourcing; technology transfer; vertical structure; competition; welfare...|$|R
