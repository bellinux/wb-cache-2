Later Idaho-gholas tempered this with cynicism but the underlying impulsiveness remained. The Tyrant <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> to action many times. Bellonda recognized a pattern. He can be goaded by pride. His long service to the Tyrant fascinated her.

25|$|In {{tropical}} or fusion rock, Bersuit Vergarabat rose to {{the zenith}} of the genre. Libertinaje (1998) catapulted the band to the top, and to tours of the Americas and Europe. The follow-up Hijos del Culo (2000) also went double-platinum. Both albums display a dizzying range in style versatility. From the side of reggae-rock Los Pericos and Los Cafres dominated. Ska had Los Calzones and Kapanga, but by 2000 Los Fabulosos Cadillacs <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> quits to their internationally renowned career of rock with ska, rap, reggae, and Latin. La Mosca and Dancing Mood reached achieved greater popularity. Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas produced some catchy, original, and danceable music (a mix of rock, hip-hop, and Latin) which cemented their fan base all over the Americas, until the duo's separation in 2001.|$|E

25|$|Morgan and his {{students}} became more successful at finding mutant flies; they counted the mutant characteristics of thousands of fruit flies and studied their inheritance. As they accumulated multiple mutants, they combined them to study more complex inheritance patterns. The observation of a miniature-wing mutant, which was also on the sex chromosome but sometimes sorted independently to the white-eye mutation, led Morgan {{to the idea of}} genetic linkage and to hypothesize the phenomenon of crossing over. He relied on the discovery of Frans Alfons Janssens, a Belgian professor at the University of Leuven, who described the phenomenon in 1909 and <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> chiasmatypie. Morgan proposed that the amount of crossing over between linked genes differs and that crossover frequency might indicate the distance separating genes on the chromosome. The later English geneticist J. B. S. Haldane suggested that the unit of measurement for linkage be called the morgan. Morgan's student Alfred Sturtevant developed the first genetic map in 1913.|$|E
25|$|At Derna, Robertson {{employed}} his brigade boldly {{in support}} of Lieutenant General Richard O'Connor's attempt {{to cut off the}} retreating Italian Army. Dougherty was ordered to seize Wadi Derna, a ravine 500 metres wide. His lead company reached the wadi and a platoon crossed it, establishing itself on the far side after a fight in which an Australian was killed and nine Italians captured. This small force was counter-attacked by the Italians but the Australians held their ground. Later a group of Italians blundered into the Australian position; 40 were killed and 56 captured. Dougherty now moved to join the attack on Derna, unaware that O'Connor <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> off. His troops soon ran into a large Italian force which was beaten off only with the help of fire from the Vickers machine guns of the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers and 25 pounders of the 2/1st Field Regiment. Dougherty had trucks drive to and fro {{to give the impression that}} the position was being reinforced. Fighting went on for another day before the Italians withdrew, having avoided encirclement. However O'Connor was later able to cut off the Italian Army at Beda Fomm. For his services in this campaign, Dougherty was mentioned in despatches and awarded the Distinguished Service Order.|$|E
500|$|The {{species was}} first {{discovered}} in 1992 in Kuitpo Forest, South Australia, and reported as new to science in a 1995 Australian Systematic Botany publication. The species name {{refers to the}} nargan or nargun, a mythical aboriginal being – originally the mycologists Tom May and Bruce Fuhrer <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "nargan", as its white speckles glistened in the dark like {{the eyes of the}} nargan, and Cheryl Grgurinovic incorporated this into its specific epithet. It is commonly known as [...] "Nargan's bonnet", but has also been referred to as the [...] "spotted pixie cap".|$|E

500|$|According to Roger Waters, Barrett {{came into}} {{what was to be}} their last {{practice}} session with a new song he had dubbed [...] "Have You Got It Yet?" [...] The song seemed simple enough when he first presented it, but it soon became impossibly difficult to learn and they eventually realised that while they were practising it, Barrett kept changing the arrangement. He would then play it again, with the arbitrary changes, and sing [...] "Have you got it yet?" [...] Eventually they realised they never would, and that they were simply bearing the brunt of Barrett's idiosyncratic sense of humour. Waters <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "a real act of mad genius".|$|E
500|$|Betelgeuse {{is often}} mistranslated as [...] "armpit {{of the central}} one".

The star was named Beldengeuze in the Alfonsine Tables, and Italian Jesuit priest and astronomer Giovanni Battista Riccioli <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> Bectelgeuze or Bedalgeuze. Paul Kunitzsch, Professor of Arabic Studies at the University of Munich, refuted Allen's derivation and instead proposed that the full name is a corruption of the Arabic [...] meaning [...] "the Hand of al-Jauzā'", i.e., Orion.|$|E

500|$|Early naturalist George Shaw <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> the blue-faced honey-sucker in 1826. Other {{common names}} include white-quilled honeyeater, and blue-eye. Its {{propensity}} for feeding on {{the flowers and}} fruit of bananas in north Queensland has given it the common name of banana-bird. A local name from Mackay in central Queensland is pandanus-bird, as it is always found around Pandanus palms there. It is called morning-bird from its dawn calls before other birds of the bush. Gympie is a Queensland [...] term. Thomas Watling noted a local indigenous name was der-ro-gang. John Hunter recorded the term gugurruk (pron. [...] "co-gurrock"), but the term was also applied to the black-shouldered kite (Elanus axillaris). It is called (minha) yeewi, where minha is a qualifier meaning 'meat' or 'animal', in Pakanh and (inh-)ewelmb in Uw Oykangand and Uw Olkola, where inh- is a qualifier meaning 'meat' or 'animal', in three aboriginal languages of central Cape York Peninsula.|$|E
500|$|... "Southern boobook" [...] {{has been}} {{designated}} the official name by the International Ornithological Committee (IOC). The common name comes from the two-tone call of the bird, and has also been transcribed as [...] "mopoke". English explorer George Caley had recorded the native name as buck-buck during {{the earliest days of}} the colony, and reporting that early settlers <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> cuckoo owl as its call was reminiscent of the common cuckoo. However, he added, [...] "The settlers in New South Wales are led away by the idea that everything is the reverse in that country to what it is in England; and the Cuckoo, as they call this bird, singing by night, is one of the instances they point out." [...] Gould recorded local aboriginal names: Goor-goor-da (Western Australia), Mel-in-de-ye (Port Essington), and Koor-koo (South Australia). Alternative common names include spotted owl and brown owl. The Ngarluma people of the western Pilbara knew it as gurrgumarlu. In the Yuwaaliyaay dialect of the Gamilaraay language of southeastern Australia, the southern boobook is guurrguurr.|$|E
500|$|Whistler, {{especially}} {{in his later}} career, resented the idea that his paintings should have any meaning beyond what could {{be seen on the}} canvas. He is known as a central proponent of the [...] "art for art's sake" [...] philosophy. His comment on The White Girl, denying a connection to Wilkie Collins' novel The Woman in White is one of the earliest of these assertions ("My painting simply represents a girl dressed in white {{standing in front of a}} white curtain.") [...] Because English critics saw the painting as an illustration, they tended to be less favourable than their French colleagues, who saw it as a visionary, poetic fantasy. One English critic, referring to Collins' novel, called The White Girl [...] "...one of the most incomplete paintings we ever met with." [...] Since the Berners Street Gallery had used the name The Woman in White for the painting, critics were disappointed with its lack of resemblance to the novel's heroine. Whistler, who had never even read the novel, resented the comparison. About ten years later, he began referring to the painting as Symphony in White, No. 1, though a French critic <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> a Symphonie du blanc already at the time of its exhibition in Paris. By the musical analogy, he further emphasised his philosophy that the composition was the central thing, not the subject matter. The title was probably also inspired by Théophile Gautier's 1852 poem Symphonie en Blanc Majeur.|$|E

2500|$|In Ynglinga saga {{compiled}} in Heimskringla, Snorri {{presents a}} euhemerized {{origin of the}} Norse gods and rulers descending from them. In chapter 5, Snorri asserts that the Æsir settled {{in what is now}} Sweden and built various temples. Snorri writes that Odin settled in Lake Logrin [...] "at a place which formerly was called Sigtúnir. There he erected a large temple and made sacrifices according to the custom of the Æsir. He took possession of the land as far as he <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> Sigtúnir. He gave dwelling places to the temple priests."

2500|$|Until 1919, wrestling matches were slow-moving {{exhibitions}} mainly {{confined to}} the mat and lasting on an average 60 minutes. Crowds no longer found this to be suitable entertainment and accordingly, they began to dwindle. Wrestling matches slowly and eventually became pre-determined. Toots Mondt joined the camp of Ed [...] "Strangler" [...] Lewis with the recommendation of Farmer Burns. Toots served in many capacities as a sparring partner, trainer, sometimes as an opponent and as a police officer. As a sparring partner and trainer, Toots Mondt helped Ed Lewis develop new holds and counters. The working relationship and unity amongst wrestling promoters was beginning to wear thin and crowd attendance was still low. Toots conceived a solution and combined features of a boxing ring, Greco-Roman, freestyle wrestling, and the old-time lumber-camp style of fighting. Toots <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> ’Slam Bang Western Style Wrestling’.|$|E
2500|$|During Frazier's amateur career, he won Golden Gloves Heavyweight Championships in 1962, 1963 and 1964. His only loss {{in three}} years as an amateur was to Buster Mathis.

They met in the final of the U.S. Olympic Trial at the New York World's Fair in the summer of 1964. Their fight was scheduled for three rounds and they fought with 10oz gloves and with headgear, even though the boxers who made it to Tokyo would wear no headgear and would wear 8oz gloves. Joe was eager to get back at Mathis for his only amateur loss and KO'd two opponents to get to the finals. But once again, when the dust settled, the judges <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> for Mathis, undeservedly Joe thought.
