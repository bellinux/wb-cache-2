5|$|Geologists and the {{official}} Ricketts Glen State Park web page classify the <b>falls</b> at Ricketts Glen State Park into two types. Wedding-cake <b>falls</b> descend {{in a series of}} small steps. Within the park, this type of <b>falls</b> usually flows over thin layers of Huntley Mountain Formation sandstone. In bridal-veil <b>falls,</b> the second type, water <b>falls</b> over a ledge and drops vertically into a plunge pool in the stream bed below. Within the park, this type of <b>falls</b> flows over Catskill Formation rocks or the red shale and sandstone of the Huntley Formation. In the park, the harder caprock which forms the ledge from which the bridal-veil <b>falls</b> drops is gray sandstone. The softer red shale below is eroded away by water, sand and gravel to form the plunge pool. Brown's book Pennsylvania waterfalls: a guide for hikers and photographers uses four types to classify waterfalls: <b>falls,</b> cascade, slide, and chute.|$|E

A total of 4, 426 individuals aged ≥ 65 years from two large-scale health surveys provided data. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify risk factors and to determine the risk model for <b>falling</b> and recurrent <b>falling</b> in men and women separately. Three major risk factors for <b>falling</b> regardless of gender or <b>fall</b> history are fear of <b>falling,</b> limitations in activities of daily living (ADL), and age ≥ 75 years. Fear of <b>falling</b> remains one of the common modifiable risk factors.
