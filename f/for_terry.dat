5|$|As the 2002 trade {{deadline}} approached, teams {{interested in}} acquiring Shuey began to inquire on his availability. On July 28, 2002, before the trade deadline, Shuey {{was traded to}} the Los Angeles Dodgers <b>for</b> <b>Terry</b> Mulholland and minor leaguers Ricardo Rodríguez and Francisco Cruceta. With the Dodgers in the playoff chase that season, they hoped to pair him with closer Éric Gagné to form a strong bullpen for the later portions of games.|$|E

In the 24th minute, Borussia player Herbert Wimmer {{suffered}} an injury {{and had to be}} replaced by Christian Kulik. Three minutes later Ian Callaghan won the ball in midfield and passed to Steve Heighway on the right wing. Heighway cut inside from a wing and passed into space <b>for</b> <b>Terry</b> McDermott who scored the opening goal of the match. Borussia began to exert more of an influence on the game after Liverpool's goal, however they were unable to equalise {{before the end of the}} first half.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{arrived in}} England for the 51st Ashes series in 1981. Willis, who was {{selected}} to play in all six Test matches, came into the series on a run of good county form. He had played four county matches, commencing with 5/61 against Yorkshire on 6 May, and 3/58 against Lancashire on 10 June. The first Test took place at Trent Bridge, Nottingham, on 18 June. England, batting first, were cut down for 185 all out thanks to four wickets <b>for</b> <b>Terry</b> Alderman and three a-piece for Dennis Lillee and Rodney Hogg. Only Mike Gatting passed fifty, and Willis was dismissed for a first-ball duck. Willis, however, combined with Dilley, Hendrick and Botham to reduce Australia to 179 all out, with three wickets for Willis. England could not take advantage, however, as Lillee and Alderman shared the host nation's ten wickets equally between them to leave Australia only 132 to win. Dilley took four wickets and Willis snatched Graeme Wood for eight to reach 200 Test wickets, however the tourists won the match with four wickets to spare.|$|E

25|$|In early 1980, Byrne did {{his first}} work for DC Comics, penciling {{the first issue}} of The Untold Legend of the Batman miniseries. Byrne had always wanted to draw Batman, and had a three-month window of time during which he was not under {{contract}} to Marvel. Hearing about the Untold Legend series, Byrne contacted editor Paul Levitz to express interest. DC took him up on his offer, {{but it was not until}} the second month of his three-month window that Byrne received the plot for the first issue. Byrne told Levitz that he would not be able to finish the project due to time constraints despite DC then allegedly offering Byrne double his Marvel pay rate, after initially saying they could not match his Marvel rate. Byrne penciled the first issue, which was inked by Jim Aparo after being intended <b>for</b> <b>Terry</b> Austin. This experience soured Byrne on DC for quite some time.|$|E

500|$|The Tom Wilkes-designed {{front cover}} of Dark Horse {{features}} a 1956 Liverpool Institute high-school photograph presented inside a lotus flower, behind which a dream-like Himalayan landscape {{extends to the}} horizon, where the [...] "deathless Yogi of the Ancient of Days", Shiv-Goraksha Babaji, sits. While some observers have seen pointed similarities with the Beatles' iconic Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band cover image, Harrison's choice of artwork reflected his enduring admiration <b>for</b> <b>Terry</b> Gilliam's animation on Monty Python's Flying Circus. In the photo, a thirteen-year-old Harrison is pictured in {{the centre of the}} top row, his face tinted blue; school teachers appear dressed in long-sleeve tops bearing a superimposed record-company logo or Om symbol. Wilkes and Harrison disagreed over the size of the Babaji image, which the designer apparently disliked and wanted to reduce in size.|$|E

500|$|When Mee {{resigned}} {{at the end}} of 1975–76, {{the board}} opted <b>for</b> <b>Terry</b> Neill as their next manager. He arrived after guiding Tottenham Hotspur to a ninth-place finish, but his association with Arsenal's local rivals created animosity between himself and the club's fans. Neill led Arsenal to three FA Cup finals between 1978 and 1980, succeeding in the [...] "five-minute final" [...] of 1979. He took them to the 1980 Cup Winners' Cup Final, which they lost in a penalty-shootout to Spanish team Valencia. Poor league form and a surprise exit in the League Cup to Walsall led to Neill's dismissal midway through 1983–84. Don Howe was promoted as manager, initially in a caretaker capacity. Though his three years brought no major silverware, he was responsible for giving debuts to several players such as Tony Adams and David Rocastle, who served the club well during the late 1980s.|$|E
500|$|Upon Doomfist's {{official}} announcement, Kotaku {{reported the}} fan reaction as [...] "beyond excited". Fan anticipation {{for the character}} rivaled that for Sombra, a character released the previous year with a prolonged reveal period. Players had hoped {{for the release of}} Doomfist each time Blizzard had revealed an additional character for the game. Polygon wrote that Doomfist's announcement cinematic, drawn in an anime style, was the best in the series to date. Fans who had lobbied <b>for</b> <b>Terry</b> Crews to play Doomfist's voice were disappointed to discover his absence, but Sahr Ngaujah's performance was praised at the time of Doomfist's formal unveiling, and fans received the character positively anyway. Blizzard's choice of Ngaujah over the higher profile Crews also meant that the voice actor would be more available to reappear for additional recording and other game community events. Doomfist also fulfilled Overwatch sore lack of a supervillain, according to IGN, in a cast of other morally ambiguous but tragic and redeemable characters. The critic anticipated Doomfist as the start of Blizzard making Talon into a villainous organization à la Legion of Doom (Justice League) or Masters of Evil (Avengers).|$|E
500|$|In 1985, Kulwicki sold {{most of his}} belongings, {{including}} his short track racing equipment, to move approximately [...] to the Charlotte area in North Carolina. He kept only a few things; his pickup truck was loaded to tow a trailer full of furniture and tools. An electrical fire twodays before he left destroyed his truck, so Kulwicki had to borrow one to pull the trailer. After arriving in the Charlotte area, he showed up unannounced at Terry's shop ready to race. Veteran NASCAR drivers were initially amused by Kulwicki's arrival on the national tour: He was a driver from the northern United States when the series was primarily a southern regional series, he had a mechanical engineering degree when few other drivers had completed college, and, with only sixstarts, had limited driving experience in the junior Busch Series. Kulwicki was described as very studious, hard working, no-nonsense, and something of a loner. He frequently walked the garage area in his racing uniform carrying a briefcase. Kulwicki made his first career Winston Cup start at Richmond on September 8, 1985, for Bill Terry's No. 32 Hardee's Ford team. That season he competed in fiveraces <b>for</b> <b>Terry,</b> with his highest finish being 13th.|$|E
