30|$|During the {{execution}} of the robustness tests, the fault injector intercepts all the SOAP messages sent by the emulated clients (generated by the workload emulator component) to the server (see Fig. 2). The XML is modified according to the robustness test being performed and then forwarded to the server. The server response is logged by the robustness-testing tool and used later on to analyze the behavior of the Web service {{in the presence of the}} <b>invalid</b> <b>call</b> parameters injected.|$|E
30|$|The {{execution}} of the workload (without considering <b>invalid</b> <b>call</b> parameters) includes several tests where each test corresponds to several executions of a given operation of the Web service. The number of times the operation is executed during each test depends {{on the size of}} the generated workload (which can be specified by the benchmark user). The goal of this step is simply to understand the typical behavior expected from the Web service (e.g., typical response format). This information is not used in the definition of the tests, but can be used in the classification of the tests results, either by individually comparing the tests results with the regular workload output, or by using an automatic robustness classification procedure based on machine learning techniques [37].|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted {{that the possibility}} of a procedure in one program to call a procedure in another program is a useful paradigm for developing distributed applications. However, in a distributed environment, programs should be allowed to be built and then changed in an independent manner, thus allowing inconsistent types to be declared in the expected and the actual remote procedure interface. If one cannot guarantee type consistency, the program executing the remote procedure would be vulnerable to <b>invalid</b> <b>call</b> requests. The paper describes how a persistent programming language can be used to implement an RPC mechanism that automatically supports type-safety. It is typesafe since the expected interface is checked against the actual remote procedure interface before a call is attempted and automatic because user intervention is only that needed otherwise (that is, to call a local procedure) ...|$|E
30|$|In “A {{robustness}} testing {{approach for}} SOAP Web services”, Nuno Laranjeiro, Marco Vieira, and Henrique Madeira address the very important, but understudied, topic of testing of distributed systems. Testing practices are nowadays highly {{used in the}} industry {{for the development of}} complex software systems. However, most of the testing research as well as technologies and tools are targeted at centralized systems. This paper addresses the part of this problem by focusing on the robustness testing of Web services. The approach proposed by the authors is based on a set of robustness tests, including both malicious and non-malicious <b>invalid</b> <b>call</b> parameters, which are used to discover programming and design errors. The proposal is validated by two sets of experiments showing the use of Web services robustness testing from the consumer and the provider points of view. The experiments comprise the robustness testing of over 1, 200 public Web service operations available in the Internet as well as 29 services implemented by the authors.|$|E
30|$|The use of Web {{services}} in enterprise applications is quickly increasing. In a Web services environment, providers supply {{a set of}} services for consumers. However, although Web services are being used in business-critical environments, there are no practical means to test or compare their robustness to invalid and malicious inputs. In fact, client applications are typically developed {{with the assumption that}} the services being used are robust, which is not always the case. Robustness failures in such environments are particularly dangerous, as they may originate vulnerabilities that can be maliciously exploited, with severe consequences for the systems under attack. This paper addresses the problem of robustness testing in Web services environments. The proposed approach is based on a set of robustness tests (including both malicious and non-malicious <b>invalid</b> <b>call</b> parameters) that is used to discover programming and design errors. This approach, useful for both service providers and consumers, is demonstrated by two sets of experiments, showing, respectively, the use of Web services Robustness testing from the consumer and the provider points of view. The experiments comprise the robustness testing of 1, 204 Web service operations publicly available in the Internet and of 29 home-implemented services, including two different implementations of the Web services specified by the standard TPC-App performance benchmark. Results show that many Web services are deployed with critical robustness problems and that robustness testing is an effective approach to improve services quality.|$|E

40|$|The {{midpoint}} method or {{technique is}} a measurement and as each measurement {{it has a}} tolerance, but worst of all it can be <b>invalid,</b> <b>called</b> Out-of-Control or OoC. The core of all midpoint methods is the accurate measurement of the difference of the squared distances of two points to the polar of their midpoint {{with respect to the}} conic. When this measurement is valid, it also measures the difference of the squared distances of these points to the conic, although it may be inaccurate, called Out-of-Accuracy or OoA. The primary condition is the necessary and sufficient condition that a measurement is valid. It is comletely new and it can be checked ultra fast and before the actual measurement starts. Modeling an incremental algorithm, shows that the curve must be subdivided into piecewise monotonic sections, the start point must be optimal, and it explains that the 2 D-incremental method can find, locally, the global Least Square Distance. Locally means that there are at most three candidate points for a given monotonic direction; therefore the 2 D-midpoint method has, locally, at most three measurements. When all the possible measurements are invalid, the midpoint method cannot be applied, and in that case the ultra fast OoC-rule selects the candidate point. This guarantees, for the first time, a 100 % stable, ultra-fast, berserkless midpoint algorithm, which can be easily transformed to hardware.

5000|$|There are {{two types}} of error that can occur using {{hypothesis}} testing, rejecting a valid model called type I error or [...] "model builders risk" [...] and accepting an <b>invalid</b> model <b>called</b> Type II error, β, or [...] "model user's risk". The level of significance or α is equal the probability of type I error. If α is small then rejecting the null hypothesis is a strong conclusion. For example, if α = 0.05 and the null hypothesis is rejected there is only a 0.05 probability of rejecting a model that is valid. Decreasing the probability of a type II error is very important. The probability of correctly detecting an invalid model is 1 - β. The probability of a type II error is dependent of the sample size and the actual difference between the sample value and the observed value. Increasing the sample size decreases the risk of a type II error.|$|R

40|$|A major {{challenge}} in instrumental variables (IV) analysis {{is to find}} instruments that are valid, or have no direct effect on the outcome and are ignorable. Typically one is unsure whether all of the putative IVs are in fact valid. We propose a general inference procedure {{in the presence of}} <b>invalid</b> IVs, <b>called</b> Two-Stage Hard Thresholding (TSHT) with voting. TSHT uses two hard thresholding steps to select strong instruments and generate candidate sets of valid IVs. Voting takes the candidate sets and uses majority and plurality rules to determine the true set of valid IVs. In low dimensions, if the sufficient and necessary identification condition under invalid instruments is met, which is more general than the so-called 50 % rule or the majority rule, our proposal (i) correctly selects valid IVs, (ii) consistently estimates the causal effect, (iii) produces valid confidence intervals for the causal effect, and (iv) has oracle-optimal width. In high dimensions, we establish nearly identical results without oracle-optimality. In simulations, our proposal outperforms traditional and recent methods in the invalid IV literature. We also apply our method to re-analyze the causal effect of education on earnings.

40|$|Present-day flood {{estimation}} practise is underpinned by {{the assumption}} that flood risk in a future climate will reflect historical flood risk as represented by the instrumental record. This assumption, which is {{commonly referred to as}} the assumption of stationarity, recently has been questioned as a result of both an increased appreciation of the natural variability in our hydroclimate at temporal scales beyond that of the instrumental record, as well as the projected intensification of the hydrologic cycle due to anthropogenic climate change. These developments have led some authors to suggest that the stationarity assumption should henceforth be considered <b>invalid,</b> thereby <b>calling</b> into question all the methods that are underpinned by it, including flood frequency analysis using observed streamflow records, and rainfall-runoff modelling informed by instrumental precipitation and streamflow records. In this paper we review a wide range of possible sources of non-stationarity in the Australian climate record, and highlight that the primary sources of non-stationarity relevant for flood risk assessments include natural climate modes that vary at timescales similar to the length of the instrumental record, as well as long-term trends and step changes that are attributable to anthropogenic climate change. Although prescriptive guidelines that describe how to address this non-stationarity are currently unavailable in Australia, this review nonetheless highlights the importance of using long records for flood analysis, possibly by extending records using nearby stations. Furthermore, it will become increasingly necessary to develop plausible estimates of how the climate will evolve, and we describe some climate modelling tools that allow for the development of future climate scenarios. Finally, we emphasise that removing the assumption of stationarity will inevitably result in an increase in the uncertainty associated with future flood estimates, and suggest that this may require new methods to conceptualise and manage future flood risk.
