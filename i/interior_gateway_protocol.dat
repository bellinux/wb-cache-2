25|$|OSPF is an <b>interior</b> <b>gateway</b> <b>protocol</b> (IGP) for routing Internet Protocol (IP) packets solely {{within a}} single routing domain, such as an {{autonomous}} system. It gathers link state information from available routers and constructs a topology map of the network. The topology {{is presented as a}} routing table to the Internet layer which routes packets based solely on their destination IP address. OSPF supports Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) and Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) networks and supports the Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) addressing model.|$|E
50|$|Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) is a {{distance}} vector <b>interior</b> <b>gateway</b> <b>protocol</b> (IGP) developed by Cisco. It {{is used by}} routers to exchange routing data within an autonomous system.|$|E
50|$|Routes {{across the}} {{provider}} backbone network are maintained using an <b>interior</b> <b>gateway</b> <b>protocol</b> - typically iBGP. IBGP uses extended community attributes {{in a common}} routing table to differentiate the customers' routes with overlapping IP addresses.|$|E

50|$|<b>Interior</b> <b>gateway</b> <b>{{protocols}}</b> can {{be divided}} into two categories: distance-vector routing protocols and link-state routing protocols. Specific examples of IGPs include Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), Routing Information Protocol (RIP), Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) and Enhanced <b>Interior</b> <b>Gateway</b> Routing <b>Protocol</b> (EIGRP).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Interior</b> <b>gateway</b> <b>protocols</b> type 2, distance-vector routing protocols, such as Routing Information Protocol, RIPv2, IGRP.|$|R
50|$|An <b>interior</b> <b>gateway</b> <b>{{protocol}}</b> (IGP) {{is a type}} of protocol {{used for}} exchanging routing information between gateways (commonly routers) within an autonomous system (for example, a system of corporate local area networks). This routing information can then be used to route network-layer protocols like IP.|$|E
5000|$|IS-IS (pronounced by {{speaking}} {{the name of}} each letter pair; that is, [...] "iz iz") is an <b>interior</b> <b>gateway</b> <b>protocol,</b> designed for use within an administrative domain or network. This {{is in contrast to}} exterior gateway protocols, primarily Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is used for routing between autonomous systems (RFC 1930).|$|E
50|$|The {{customer}} edge (CE) is the router at {{the customer}} premises that {{is connected to}} the provider edge of a service provider IP/MPLS network. CE peers with the Provider Edge (PE) and exchanges routes with the corresponding VRF inside the PE. The routing protocol used could be static or dynamic (an <b>interior</b> <b>gateway</b> <b>protocol</b> like OSPF or an exterior gateway protocol like BGP).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Interior</b> <b>gateway</b> <b>protocols</b> (IGPs) {{exchange}} {{routing information}} {{within a single}} routing domain. Examples of IGPs include: ...|$|R
50|$|The Enhanced <b>Interior</b> <b>Gateway</b> Routing <b>Protocol</b> {{replaced}} the <b>Interior</b> <b>Gateway</b> Routing <b>Protocol</b> (IGRP) in 1993. One {{of the major}} reasons for this was the change to classless IPv4 addresses in the Internet Protocol, which IGRP could not support.|$|R
50|$|Convergence is an {{important}} notion {{for a set of}} routers that engage in dynamic routing. All <b>Interior</b> <b>Gateway</b> <b>Protocols</b> rely on convergence to function properly. To have converged it is the normal state of an operational autonomous system. The Exterior <b>Gateway</b> Routing <b>Protocol</b> BGP typically never converges because the Internet is too big for changes to be communicated fast enough.|$|R
50|$|VIP {{addresses}} {{are also}} used for connection redundancy by providing alternative fail-over options for one machine. For this to work, the host has to run an <b>interior</b> <b>gateway</b> <b>protocol</b> like OSPF, and appear as a router {{to the rest of}} the network. It advertises virtual links connected via itself to all of its actual network interfaces. If one network interface fails, normal OSPF topology reconvergence will cause traffic to be sent via another interface.|$|E
50|$|Networks {{that speak}} BGP {{to each other}} can engage in multi exit {{discriminator}} exchange with each other, although most do not. When networks interconnect in several locations, MEDs {{can be used to}} reference that network's <b>interior</b> <b>gateway</b> <b>protocol</b> cost. This results in both networks sharing the burden of transporting each other's traffic on their own network (or cold potato). Hot-potato or nearest-exit routing, which is typically the normal behavior on the Internet, is where traffic destined to another network is delivered to the closest interconnection point.|$|E
5000|$|OSPF is an <b>interior</b> <b>gateway</b> <b>protocol</b> (IGP) for routing Internet Protocol (IP) packets solely {{within a}} single routing domain, such as an {{autonomous}} system. It gathers link state information from available routers and constructs a topology map of the network. The topology {{is presented as a}} routing table to the Internet layer which routes packets based solely on their destination IP address. OSPF supports Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) and Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) networks and supports the Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) addressing model.|$|E
50|$|IP {{addressing}} {{entails the}} assignment of IP addresses and associated parameters to host interfaces. The address space is divided into subnetworks, involving the designation of network prefixes. IP routing is performed by all hosts, as well as routers, whose main function is to transport packets across network boundaries. Routers {{communicate with one another}} via specially designed routing <b>protocols,</b> either <b>interior</b> <b>gateway</b> <b>protocols</b> or exterior <b>gateway</b> <b>protocols,</b> as needed for the topology of the network.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Gateway</b> Information <b>Protocol's</b> descendant, RIP, (with minor {{modifications}} {{to carry the}} addresses of any protocol family), remains in use today in other protocol suites, including TCP/IP. One version of RIP served {{as one of the}} initial so-called <b>interior</b> <b>gateway</b> <b>protocols</b> for the growing Internet, before the arrival of the more modern OSPF and IS-IS. It is still in use as an interior routing protocol, in small sites with simple requirements.|$|R
25|$|Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a routing {{protocol}} for Internet Protocol (IP) networks. It uses a link state routing (LSR) algorithm and {{falls into the}} group of <b>interior</b> <b>gateway</b> <b>protocols</b> (IGPs), operating within a single autonomous system (AS). It is defined as OSPF Version 2 in RFC 2328 (1998) for IPv4. The updates for IPv6 are specified as OSPF Version 3 in RFC 5340 (2008).|$|R
50|$|MPLS {{works in}} {{conjunction}} with the Internet Protocol (IP) and its routing protocols, such as the <b>Interior</b> <b>Gateway</b> <b>Protocol</b> (IGP). MPLS LSPs provide dynamic, transparent virtual networks with support for traffic engineering, the ability to transport layer-3 (IP) VPNs with overlapping address spaces, and support for layer-2 pseudowires using Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) that are capable of transporting a variety of transport payloads (IPv4, IPv6, ATM, Frame Relay, etc.). MPLS-capable devices are referred to as LSRs. The paths an LSR knows can be defined using explicit hop-by-hop configuration, or are dynamically routed by the constrained shortest path first (CSPF) algorithm, or are configured as a loose route that avoids a particular IP address or that is partly explicit and partly dynamic.|$|E

50|$|This method determines a {{path through}} the network based on the <b>interior</b> <b>gateway</b> <b>protocol's</b> view of the network. If no {{constraints}} are applied to the LSP then the routers simply send the request for a path to the active next hop for that destination, without explicit routing. The IGP at each router is free to select active next hops based on the link state database.|$|R
50|$|Hybrid routing {{protocols}} have both {{the features of}} distance vector {{routing protocols}} and linked state routing protocols. One example is Enhanced <b>Interior</b> <b>Gateway</b> Routing <b>Protocol</b> (EIGRP).|$|R
50|$|Cisco's {{proprietary}} <b>Interior</b> <b>Gateway</b> Routing <b>Protocol</b> (IGRP) was {{a somewhat}} more capable protocol than RIP. It belongs to the same basic family of distance-vector routing protocols. Cisco has ceased support and distribution of IGRP in their router software. It {{was replaced by the}} Enhanced <b>Interior</b> <b>Gateway</b> Routing <b>Protocol</b> (EIGRP) which is a completely new design. While EIGRP still uses a distance-vector model, it relates to IGRP only in using the same routing metrics. IGRP supports multiple metrics for each route, including bandwidth, delay, load, MTU, and reliability.|$|R
30|$|An energy {{efficiency}} and load balancing optimization algorithm called as Green-Load-balancing Algorithm (GLA) based on existing link switch off techniques is introduced in [51]. By optimizing the <b>Interior</b> <b>Gateway</b> <b>Protocol</b> (IGP) link weights of a network, energy saving gains are obtained by using the link sleeping and load balancing jointly. The algorithm aims to put more links to sleep without affecting the load balancing requirements. In simulations, the GEANT is used. The GLA is compared with <b>Interior</b> <b>Gateway</b> <b>Protocol</b> Weight Optimization (IGP-WO), and it is obtained that GLA shows slightly better performance than IGP-WO in terms of load balancing and results in energy savings at the same time. According to several experiment scenarios, the proposed algorithm improves the {{energy efficiency}} and enhances the performance of existing switch off algorithms in terms of energy efficiency.|$|E

30|$|Survivable {{multicast}} routing {{is important}} for providing a reliable IPTV service. Generally, most carriers route multicast traffic using the protocol-independent multicast source-specific mode (PIM-SSM) based on the routing {{information provided by the}} <b>interior</b> <b>gateway</b> <b>protocol</b> (IGP). Restoration using the IGP reconfiguration is slow and typically takes from 10 to 60 seconds. To ensure a fast restoration, we consider node and link failure recovery in the Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) optical layer. The backup path is provided in this layer. Thus, the multicast tree does not change at the IP layer (the logical links do not change) and the restoration time is faster (typically of the order of 50 to 80 ms).|$|E
