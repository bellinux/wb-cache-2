5|$|RNAi in vivo {{delivery}} to tissues still eludes science—especially to tissues {{deep within the}} body. RNAi delivery is only easily accessible to surface tissues such as the eye and respiratory tract. In these instances, siRNA {{has been used in}} direct contact with the tissue for transport. The resulting RNAi successfully focused on target genes. When delivering siRNA to deep tissues, the siRNA must be protected from nucleases, but targeting specific areas becomes the main difficulty. This difficulty has been combatted with <b>high</b> <b>dosage</b> levels of siRNA to ensure the tissues have been reached, however in these cases hepatotoxicity was reported.|$|E

25|$|The two did not {{fare well}} against the trio losing both tag team and single matches to {{them during the}} next few weeks. On October 18, he and Bolen also lost to them in a {{handicap}} match. Things soon changed, however, when <b>High</b> <b>Dosage</b> beat Eddie Craven and Mike Kruel a month later. As a result of their victory, they were allowed five minutes alone with Shawn Osbourne but he was able to escape with the help of Craven and Kruel. Although continuing to face their rivals throughout the year, <b>High</b> <b>Dosage</b> also won matches against Los Locos and Bad Company defeating them later in a Handicap Coal Miner's Glove on a Pole match on November 29. On December 9, <b>High</b> <b>Dosage</b> teamed with Seth Skyfire and lost to Craven, Kruel and Milena Roucka.

25|$|The sebaceous glands {{are highly}} androgen-sensitive and {{their size and}} {{activity}} are potential markers of androgenic effect. A <b>high</b> <b>dosage</b> of 20mg/day NET or NETA {{has been found to}} significantly stimulate the sebaceous glands, whereas lower dosages of 5mg/day and 2.5mg/day NET and NETA, respectively, did not significantly stimulate sebum production and were consequently regarded as devoid of significant androgenicity. Conversely, dosages of NET of 0.5 to 3mg/day have been found to dose-dependently decrease SHBG levels (and hence to suppress hepatic SHBG production), which is another highly sensitive marker of androgenicity.|$|E

25|$|Spironolactone {{has been}} studied at a <b>high</b> <b>dosage</b> in the {{treatment}} of benign prostatic hyperplasia. It was found to be better than placebo in terms of symptom relief following three months of treatment. However, this was not maintained after six months of treatment, by which point the improvements had largely disappeared. Moreover, no difference was observed between spironolactone and placebo with regard to volume of residual urine or prostate size. Gynecomastia was observed in about 5% of people. On the basis of these results, {{it has been said that}} spironolactone has no place {{in the treatment of}} benign prostatic hyperplasia.|$|E
25|$|Nilutamide is a nitroaromatic {{hydantoin}} analog of flutamide, as seen {{in figure}} 5. Nilutamide is eliminated exclusively by metabolism, mainly by reduction of the aromatic nitro group. Although the hydrolysis {{of one of the}} carbonyl functions of the imidazolinedione was identified, it is much less susceptible to hepatic metabolism than the amide bond in hydroxuflutamide. This results in a longer half-life of nilutamide in humans of 2 days. Nevertheless, the nitro anion-free radical formed during nitro reduction could still be associated with hepatotoxicity in humans, especially when using relatively <b>high</b> <b>dosage</b> employed for androgen blockage. Nilutamide causes side-effects which limit its usage, such as pneumonitis and delayed adaption to darkness.|$|E
25|$|Single {{doses of}} 50 to 200mg {{sertraline}} {{have been found}} to result in peak plasma concentrations of 20 to 55ng/mL (65–180nM), while chronic treatment with 200mg/day sertraline, the maximum recommended dosage, has been found to result in maximal plasma levels of 118 to 166ng/mL (385–542nM). However, sertraline is highly protein-bound in plasma, with a bound fraction of 98.5%. Hence, only 1.5% is free and theoretically bioactive. Based on this percentage, free concentrations of sertraline would be 2.49ng/mL (8.13nM) at the very most, which is only about one-third of the Ki value that Tatsumi et al. found with sertraline at the DAT. A very <b>high</b> <b>dosage</b> of sertraline of 400mg/day has been found to produce peak plasma concentrations of about 250ng/mL (816nM). This can be estimated to result in a free concentration of 3.75ng/mL (12.2nM), which is still only about half of the Ki of sertraline for the DAT.|$|E
25|$|NET is weakly estrogenic (via {{conversion}} {{into its}} metabolite EE), {{and for this}} reason, {{it has been found}} at <b>high</b> <b>dosages</b> to be associated with high rates of estrogenic side effects such as breast enlargement in women and gynecomastia in men, but also with improvement of menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women. It has been suggested that very <b>high</b> <b>dosages</b> (e.g., 40mg/day, which are sometimes used in clinical practice for various indications) of NETA (and by extension NET) may result in an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) analogously to <b>high</b> <b>dosages</b> (above 50μg/day) of EE, and that even dosages of NETA of 10 to 20mg, which correspond to EE dosages of approximately 20 to 30μg/day, may in certain women be associated with increased risk.|$|R

25|$|No firm {{conclusions}} can be drawn, however, whether {{long-term use}} of quazepam does not produce tolerance as few, if any, long-term clinical trials extending beyond 4 weeks of chronic use have been conducted. Quazepam should be withdrawn gradually if used beyond 4 weeks of use to avoid {{the risk of a}} severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome developing. Very <b>high</b> <b>dosage</b> administration over prolonged periods of time, up to 52 weeks, of quazepam in animal studies provoked severe withdrawal symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation, including excitability, hyperactivity, convulsions and the death of two of the monkeys due to withdrawal-related convulsions. More monkeys died however, in the diazepam-treated monkeys. In addition it has now been documented in the medical literature that one of the major metabolites of quazepam, N-desalkyl-2-oxoquazepam (N-desalkylflurazepam), which is long-acting and prone to accumulation, binds unselectively to benzodiazepine receptors, thus quazepam may not differ all that much pharmacologically from other benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|Like all benzodiazepines, {{clonazepam}} is a GABA-positive allosteric modulator. One-third {{of individuals}} treated with benzodiazepines {{for longer than}} four weeks develop a dependence on the drug and experience a withdrawal syndrome upon dose reduction. <b>High</b> <b>dosage</b> and long-term use increase the risk and severity of dependence and withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal seizures and psychosis can occur in severe cases of withdrawal, and anxiety and insomnia can occur in less severe cases of withdrawal. A gradual reduction in dosage reduces {{the severity of the}} benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Due to the risks of tolerance and withdrawal seizures, clonazepam is generally not recommended for the long-term management of epilepsies. Increasing the dose can overcome the effects of tolerance, but tolerance to the higher dose may occur and adverse effects may intensify. The mechanism of tolerance includes receptor desensitization, down regulation, receptor decoupling, and alterations in subunit composition and in gene transcription coding.|$|E
25|$|Progestogens have antigonadotropic effects at {{sufficiently}} high dosages via {{activation of}} the PR and consequent negative feedback on and hence suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis. The minimum ovulation-inhibiting (i.e., contraceptive) dosage of OMP in women, this effect being the result of suppression of the mid-cycle surge in gonadotropin secretion, is 300mg/day. Conversely, treatment with a <b>high</b> <b>dosage</b> of OMP of 100mg four times per day (or 400mg/day total) in men for 10days that resulted in approximately mid-luteal phase levels of progesterone (7.9–9.4ng/mL) did not cause any change in testosterone levels, suggesting that progesterone {{has little or no}} antigonadotropic effect in males at typical clinical dosages. On the other hand, a single 50mg intramuscular injection of progesterone, which is associated with very high progesterone levels of approximately 50ng/mL (or early- to mid-pregnancy levels), resulted in substantial (50–60%) suppression of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and testosterone levels in men.|$|E

50|$|CPA has {{powerful}} antigonadotropic effects via {{activation of}} the PR. In humans, it blunts the gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH)-induced secretion of gonadotropins, and accordingly, markedly suppresses circulating levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) at <b>high</b> <b>dosages.</b> Consequently, progesterone (P4), androstenedione, T, DHT, and estradiol (E2) are also markedly lowered at <b>high</b> <b>dosages,</b> while an elevation in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and prolactin levels is observed. CPA is able to lower circulating T concentrations by 70 to 80% in men at <b>high</b> <b>dosages.</b> However, in spite of strong suppression of testosterone levels, CPA, at least by itself (e.g., without estrogen), {{is not able to}} reduce testosterone levels into the castrate range (<50 ng/dL), and testosterone levels may remain just above it at circulating levels of roughly 50 to 100 ng/dL.|$|R
500|$|A 2011 {{prospective}} study by Roland R.Griffiths and colleagues {{suggests that a}} single <b>high</b> <b>dosage</b> of psilocybin can cause long-term changes in the personality of its users. About half of the study participants—described as healthy, [...] "spiritually active", and many possessing postgraduate degrees—showed {{an increase in the}} personality dimension of openness (assessed using the Revised NEO Personality Inventory), and this positive effect was apparent {{more than a year after}} the psilocybin session. According to the study authors, the finding is significant because [...] "no study has prospectively demonstrated personality change in healthy adults after an experimentally manipulated discrete event." [...] Although other researchers have described instances of psychedelic drug usage leading to new psychological understandings and personal insights, it is not known whether these experimental results can be generalized to larger populations.|$|E
500|$|Boyd {{has said}} that he prefers to believe the {{overdose}} was accidental.

Reasoning that Drake may have taken a <b>high</b> <b>dosage</b> of antidepressants to recapture this sense of optimism, he said he prefers to imagine Drake [...] "making a desperate lunge for life rather than a calculated surrender to death". Writing in 1975, NME journalist Nick Kent commented on the irony of Drake's death {{at a time when he}} had just begun to regain a sense of [...] "personal balance". In contrast, Gabrielle Drake has said she prefers to think her brother committed suicide, [...] "in the sense that I'd rather he died because he wanted to end it than it to be the result of a tragic mistake.
