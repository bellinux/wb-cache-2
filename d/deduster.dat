The evaluation is conducted using data from our cost effectiveness study of odor {{management strategies}} and our on farm studies relating odor to various management practices. These strategies include manual oil sprinkling, automatic oil sprinkling, wet scrubber, diffusion-coagulation-separation (DCS) <b>deduster,</b> pelleting feed, and draining shallow pit weekly. The criteria employed to evaluate the strategies are odor reduction efficiency, costs, nutrients in manure, and other benefits. Two producer profiles are considered: (a) producers who are pressured to achieve maximum reduction in odor emissions; and (b) producers who are constrained with limited financial resources. Both of these profiles are reflective of current situations for some producers. The results show that, as the scale fuzziness decreases, the preference of the first producer profile over the strategies from high to low is DCS <b>deduster,</b> pelleting feed, automatic oil sprinkling, manual oil sprinkling, draining pit weekly, and wet scrubber while the preference of the second producer profile is draining pit weekly, DCS dedusters, automatic oil sprinkling, wet scrubbers, pelleting feed, and manual oil sprinkling.
