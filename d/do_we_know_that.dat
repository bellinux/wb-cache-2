2500|$|Scholar Park Honan, in Shakespeare, A Life (1998), concurs {{with the}} view that Shakespeare's biblical {{references}} are essentially conformist, alluding to {{his use of the}} Bishop's Bible in his plays and religious activity in Protestant circles. However, critics of the former point say that Church attendance cannot be taken as a conclusive proof because attendance at Protestant churches was mandatory in the epoch. Hence, Callaghan concludes that [...] "we may not know decisively if Shakespeare was a Catholic, but crucially, neither <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> he was a stalwart Protestant." ...|$|E

But how <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{we have a right to}} kill creatures that we are so little above as dogs, for our curiosity, or even for some use to us?". Pope, however was also a close friend of Hales [...] and considered him the model of the man who loves his God.|$|E

2500|$|In 1936, philosopher Alfred Ayer {{considered}} the standard philosophical question of other minds: how <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{other people have}} the same conscious experiences that we do? In his book, Language, Truth and Logic, Ayer suggested a protocol to distinguish between a conscious man and an unconscious machine: [...] "The only ground I can have for asserting that an object {{which appears to be}} conscious is not really a conscious being, but only a dummy or a machine, is that it fails to satisfy one of the empirical tests by which {{the presence or absence of}} consciousness is determined." [...] (This suggestion is very similar to the Turing test, but is concerned with consciousness rather than intelligence. Moreover, it is not certain that Ayer's popular philosophical classic was familiar to Turing.) In other words, a thing is not conscious if it fails the consciousness test.|$|E
2500|$|The {{difficulty}} appears {{when there}} is no natural choice of elements from each set. [...] If we cannot make explicit choices, how <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> our set exists? [...] For example, suppose that X is the set of all non-empty subsets of the real numbers. [...] First we might try to proceed as if X were finite. [...] If we try to choose an element from each set, then, because X is infinite, our choice procedure will never come to an end, and consequently, we shall never be able to produce a choice function for all of X. [...] Next we might try specifying the least element from each set. [...] But some subsets of the real numbers do not have least elements. For example, the open interval (0,1) does not have a least element: if x is in (0,1), then so is x/2, and x/2 is always strictly smaller than x. [...] So this attempt also fails.|$|E
