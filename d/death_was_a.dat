5|$|Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 10th Earl of Shaftesbury Bt (22 May 1938 – c. 5 November 2004), styled Lord Ashley between 1947 and 1961, and Earl of Shaftesbury from 1961 {{until his}} <b>death,</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> British peer from Wimborne St Giles, Dorset, England. He {{was the son}} of Major Anthony Ashley-Cooper, Lord Ashley, and Françoise Soulier.|$|E
5|$|Arundel was {{considered}} a great soldier by his contemporaries. He had been a successful commander in France, {{in a period of}} decline for the English, and his <b>death</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> great loss to his country. He was succeeded by his son Humphrey, who did not live to adulthood. The title of Earl of Arundel then went to John's younger brother William.|$|E
5|$|Harrison's <b>death</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{disappointment}} to Whigs, who hoped {{to pass a}} revenue tariff and enact measures to support Henry Clay's American system. John Tyler, Harrison's successor and a former Democrat, abandoned the Whig agenda, effectively cutting himself off from the party.|$|E

5|$|Only in 2007, 17 {{years after}} his <b>death,</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> small {{memorial}} plaque placed {{on the side of}} the building where he lived in Rostov-on-Don. There is also a memorial wall with his name engraved on it in Boston. A street was named in his honor in Safed, Israel, and a stone memorial erected in Tel Aviv more recently.|$|E
5|$|Bizet's {{marriage}} to Geneviève Halévy was intermittently happy and produced one son. After his death, his work, apart from Carmen, was generally neglected. Manuscripts were given away or lost, and published versions {{of his works}} were frequently revised and adapted by other hands. He founded no school and had no obvious disciples or successors. After years of neglect, his works began to be performed more frequently in the 20th century. Later commentators have acclaimed him as a composer of brilliance and originality whose premature <b>death</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> significant loss to French musical theatre.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s Vaughan Williams {{came to be}} {{regarded}} as a leading figure in British music, particularly after the deaths of Elgar, Delius and Holst in 1934. Holst's <b>death</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> severe personal and professional blow to Vaughan Williams; the two had been each other's closest friends and musical advisers since their college days. After Holst's death Vaughan Williams was glad of the advice and support of other friends including Boult and the composer Gerald Finzi, but his relationship with Holst was irreplaceable.|$|E

50|$|Dignified <b>death</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{somewhat}} elusive concept often {{related to}} suicide. One factor that has <b>been</b> cited as <b>a</b> core component of dignified <b>death</b> <b>is</b> maintaining <b>a</b> sense of control. Another view <b>is</b> that <b>a</b> truly dignified <b>death</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> extension of a dignified life. There is some concern that assisted suicide {{does not guarantee}} a dignified death, since some patients may experience complications such as nausea and vomiting. There is some concern that age discrimination denies the elderly a dignified death.|$|R

5|$|George E. Pickett died in Norfolk, Virginia, on July 30, 1875. The {{cause of}} <b>death</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> liver abscess, {{although}} {{whether it was}} amoebic or bacterial is not clear. He was initially interred in Cedar Grove Cemetery in Norfolk. His remains were disinterred on October 23 and he was buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia on October 24, 1875. More than 40,000 people lined the funeral route while another 5,000 marched in the funeral procession. A memorial to Pickett was erected over his grave site and dedicated on October 5, 1888. The memorial was not, however, placed directly above Pickett's burial site, and {{the exact location of}} his remains is not clear.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{created a}} public {{image as a}} celibate man without a {{domestic}} life, dedicated entirely to his political mission and the nation. He met his lover, Eva Braun, in 1929, and married her in April 1945. In September 1931, his half-niece, Geli Raubal, took her own life with Hitler's gun in his Munich apartment. It was rumoured among contemporaries that Geli was in a romantic relationship with him, and her <b>death</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> source of deep, lasting pain. Paula Hitler, the younger sister of Hitler and the last living member of his immediate family, died in 1960.|$|E
5|$|In August 1999, {{our mother}} had {{died of cancer in}} tragic {{circumstances}} while we were all enjoying ourselves at my eldest son's wedding. For my brother, her <b>death</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> catastrophe. He adored her. She had been his protector and greatest admirer since the death of our father in 1947, when Anthony was eight and I was six. When our mother died, it was as though my brother had become an orphan at age 61. Without her, he felt emotionally bereft. He lost his grip on reality. At one point, he had bought a flat in Versailles, and had entirely recreated two rooms from our late mother's house. He had used all the furniture, books and knick-knacks of our childhood in Paris. It was a bit much.|$|E

The exact circumstances of Sikorski's death have been disputed and {{have given rise to}} a number of different theories surrounding the crash and his death. Sikorski had been the most prestigious leader of the Polish exiles, and his <b>death</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> severe setback for the Polish cause.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner died on 27 October 2010, {{at the age}} of 60. The day was a {{national}} holiday for the INDEC to run {{a national}} census, so he was at home in El Calafate. After a cardiac arrest, Kirchner was rushed to a local hospital and was pronounced dead at 9:15a.m. He had undergone two medical procedures that year: surgery on his right carotid artery in February and an angioplasty in September. His <b>death</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> surprise for the Argentinian population, to whom he had always represented his heart problems as not very serious.|$|E
5|$|Milo's legendary {{strength}} and death {{have become the}} subjects of modern art and literature. His <b>death</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> popular subject in 18th-century art. In many images of this period his killer is portrayed as a lion rather than wolves. In Pierre Puget's sculpture Milo of Croton (1682), the work's themes are the loss of strength with age, and the ephemerality of glory as symbolized by an Olympic trophy lying in the dust.|$|E

5|$|On 14 November 2011, British citizen Neil Heywood {{was found}} dead in his Chongqing hotel room. At the time, local {{authorities}} declared he had died from alcohol over-consumption, though his family noted that he was not a heavy drinker. The official cause of death was not scrutinized until several months later, when revelations emerged that Heywood's <b>death</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> homicide, and Bo Xilai was implicated.|$|E
5|$|The {{immediate}} {{consequence of}} William's <b>death</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> war between his sons Robert and William {{over control of}} England and Normandy. Even after the younger William's death in 1100 and the succession of his youngest brother Henry as king, Normandy and England remained contested between the brothers until Robert's capture by Henry at the Battle of Tinchebray in 1106. The difficulties over the succession led {{to a loss of}} authority in Normandy, with the aristocracy regaining much of the power they had lost to the elder William. His sons also lost much of their control over Maine, which revolted in 1089 and managed to remain mostly free of Norman influence thereafter.|$|E
5|$|While Adams was {{attending}} the ratifying convention, {{his only son}} Samuel Adams, Jr. died at just 37 years of age. The younger Adams had served as surgeon in the Revolutionary War, but had fallen ill and never fully recovered. The <b>death</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> stunning blow to the elder Adams. The younger Adams left his father the certificates that he had earned as a soldier, giving Adams and his wife unexpected financial security in their final years. Investments in land made them relatively wealthy by the mid-1790s, but this did not alter their frugal lifestyle.|$|E

5|$|Josephine {{grew up in}} a well-to-do and {{politically}} connected progressive family which helped develop in her a strong social conscience and firmly held religious ideals. She married George Butler, an Anglican divine and schoolmaster, and the couple had four children, the last of whom, Eva, died falling from a bannister. The <b>death</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> turning point for Josephine, and she focused her feelings on helping others, starting with the inhabitants of a local workhouse. She began to campaign for women's rights in British law. In 1869 she became involved in the campaign to repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts, legislation that attempted to control the spread of venereal diseases—particularly in the British Army and Royal Navy—through the forced medical examination of prostitutes, a process she described as surgical or steel rape. The campaign achieved its final success in 1886 with the repeal of the Acts. Josephine also formed the International Abolitionist Federation, a Europe-wide organisation to combat similar systems on the continent.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{opened a}} law {{practice}} in Columbia City in 1876, taking on many minor cases. After gaining prominence, he accepted William F. McNagny {{as a partner}} in 1879 and began taking many criminal defense cases. The two men functioned well as partners. McNagny was better educated in law and worked out their legal arguments. Marshall, the superior orator, argued the cases before the judge and jury. Their firm became well known in the region after they handled a number of high-profile cases. In 1880 Marshall ran for public office {{for the first time as}} the Democratic candidate for his district's prosecuting attorney. The district was a Republican stronghold, and he was defeated. About the same time, he met and began to court Kate Hooper, and the two became engaged to marry. Kate died of an illness in 1882, one day before they were to be wed. Her <b>death</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> major emotional blow to Marshall, leading him to become an alcoholic.|$|E
5|$|On 3September 1950, Sergeant Bill Harrop {{was forced}} down {{behind enemy lines}} and {{executed}} by the North Koreans. Six days later, Spence was killed when his Mustang failed {{to pull out of}} a dive during a napalm attack on Angang-ni. His <b>death</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> serious blow to the squadron, and the RAAF despatched Cresswell on his third tour as commanding officer to replace him. Cresswell arrived at Iwakuni on 17September and set about restoring morale, undertaking four sorties on his first day of operations three days later. MacArthur had meanwhile launched an amphibious landing behind North Korean lines at Inchon, forcing the communists to retreat from the Pusan Perimeter. No.77 Squadron was transferred from Iwakuni to Pohang, South Korea, on 12October, to support UN forces advancing northwards. On 20October, the squadron became a component of the RAAF's newly established No.91 (Composite) Wing, which also included No.391 (Base) Squadron, No.491 (Maintenance) Squadron, and No.30 Communications Flight, formerly the No.77 Squadron Communications Flight. The wing and all units except No.77 Squadron, which came under the operational control of the US 35th Fighter-Interceptor Group, were headquartered at Iwakuni.|$|E
