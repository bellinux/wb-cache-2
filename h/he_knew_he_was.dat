But to have experienced what the lyrics in that song are actually about? I don't know if he fully understood it.|$|E
5|$|The program's {{producers}} and Brockman met {{to review the}} videotape. They noticed that Larson would immediately celebrate after many of his spins instead of waiting the {{fraction of a second}} it would take for a contestant to see and respond to the space he or she had stopped on, effectively showing <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to get something good. It was also noticed that Larson had an unusual reaction to his early prize of a Kauai trip, which was out of his pattern – he initially looked puzzled and upset, but then recovered and celebrated after a pause.|$|E
25|$|The casting of Fenella Woolgar as Agatha Christie {{was made}} at the {{suggestion}} of David Tennant, who had previously worked with her on Bright Young Things and <b>He</b> <b>Knew</b> <b>He</b> <b>Was</b> Right.

25|$|Following his mother's death, Izzard {{attended}} {{boarding schools}} such as St John's School in Porthcawl, Mid Glamorgan, {{as well as}} St Bede's Prep School and Eastbourne College in East Sussex. He said that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a transgender person {{at the age of}} four, after watching another boy being forced to wear a dress by his sisters, and knew he wanted to be an actor at the age of seven.|$|E
25|$|The {{achievement}} of his father, headwaiter at the St. James Hotel, a luxury establishment built when Jacksonville {{was one of}} Florida's first winter resort destinations, inspired young James to pursue a professional career. Molded by the classical education for which Atlanta University was best known, Johnson regarded his academic training as a trust. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> expected to devote himself to helping black people advance. Johnson was a prominent member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity.|$|E
25|$|Although Bath {{police had}} not {{previously}} suspected Straffen was violent, he was considered {{a suspect in the}} murder and seen by police on 3 August. Meanwhile, the police had visited Straffen's employer to check on his movements; this resulted in Straffen being dismissed on 31 July. In a later interview with a prison psychiatrist, Straffen said that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> under suspicion and wanted to annoy the police, because he hated them for shadowing him.|$|E

25|$|Uglow {{presented}} The Poet of Albion, a BBC Radio 4 programme on William Blake, part of {{a series}} marking the 250th anniversary of the poet's birth; the programme emphasised Blake's radicalism. She has also twice appeared on the Radio 4 discussion programme, In Our Time. She acted as a historical consultant on several period dramas for the BBC, including Wives and Daughters (1999), Daniel Deronda (2002), <b>He</b> <b>Knew</b> <b>He</b> <b>Was</b> Right (2004), North and South (2004), Bleak House (2005) and Cranford (2007), {{as well as for the}} films Pride and Prejudice (2005) and Miss Potter (2006).|$|E
25|$|In late February, Gallinger {{was visiting}} {{his family in}} Port Colborne when he {{received}} a call to come to Toronto to be questioned concerning the Detroit gambler. On the train ride to Toronto, Gallinger made the decision he would deny everything to save his father the disgrace. In Toronto, {{the general manager of}} the Bruins, Art Ross, was questioning all the Boston players one-by-one. When it was his turn, Ross told Gallinger <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> involved, but Gallinger continued to insist on his innocence. Art Ross then personally approached Gallinger's father and proposed the idea of his son seeing a psychiatrist in Toronto. When his father told him of the idea, Gallinger refused. Years later, Gallinger stated that he regretted the decision as in retrospect he realized that Ross was {{looking for a way to}} defend him.|$|E
25|$|After his {{fingerprints}} {{were found}} at the crime scene, Guede was extradited from Germany; he had said on the Internet that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a suspect and wanted to clear his name. Guede opted for a fast-track trial, held in closed session with no reporters present. He told the court that {{he had gone to}} Via della Pergola7 on a date arranged with Kercher, after meeting her the previous evening. Two neighbours of Guede's, foreign female students who were with him at a nightclub on that evening, told police the only girl they saw him talking to had long blonde hair. Guede said Kercher had let him in the cottage around 9pm. Sollecito's lawyers said a glass fragment from the window found beside a shoe-print of Guede's {{at the scene of the}} crime was proof that Guede had broken in.|$|E

25|$|One year later, eight {{criminal}} {{fraud charges}} were {{brought by the}} Chicago U. S. Attorney against Black and three former Hollinger executives. The U.S. Attorney laid four new charges against Black on 15 December 2005, alleging racketeering, obstruction of justice, money laundering, mail fraud, tax evasion and wire fraud. Under the racketeering count, the government sought forfeiture of more than $92,000,000 (USD). The obstruction count related to Black and his chauffeur removing boxes of documents from Hollinger offices in Toronto on June 9, 2005, contrary to a court order that prohibited removal. Black contested the obstruction count {{on the grounds that}} he was obeying an eviction notice, that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> being filmed because he had installed the security cameras which filmed him, that he had already provided copies of every document prosecutors had asked for, and that not a single commercially relevant document in those boxes was not already possessed by prosecutors.|$|E
25|$|Tennant {{contributed to}} several audio dramatisations of Shakespeare for the Arkangel Shakespeare series (1998). His roles include a {{reprisal}} of his Antipholus of Syracuse in The Comedy of Errors, {{as well as}} Launcelot Gobbo in The Merchant of Venice, Edgar/Poor Tom in King Lear, and Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet, all of which he performs in his natural accent. In 1995, Tennant appeared at the Royal National Theatre, London, {{playing the role of}} Nicholas Beckett in Joe Orton's What the Butler Saw. In television, he appeared in the first episode of Reeves and Mortimer's revamped Randall and Hopkirk in 2000, playing an eccentric artist. This is one of his few TV roles in his native Scottish accent. During the Christmas season of 2002, he starred in a series of television advertisements for Boots the Chemists. He began to appear on television more prominently in 2004 and 2005, when he appeared in a dramatisation of <b>He</b> <b>Knew</b> <b>He</b> <b>Was</b> Right (2004), Blackpool (2004), Casanova (2005), and The Quatermass Experiment (2005). In film, he appeared in Bright Young Things (2003), and later that same year appeared as Barty Crouch Jr. in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.|$|E
25|$|For his self-defence, Socrates first {{eliminates}} {{any claim}} {{that he is a}} wise man. He says that Chaerephon, reputed to be impetuous, went to the Oracle of Delphi and asked her, the Pythia, to tell him of anyone who was wiser than Socrates. The Pythia answered to Chaerephon that there was no man wiser. On learning of that oracular pronouncement, Socrates says he was astounded, because, on the one hand, it is against the nature of the Oracle to lie, but, on the other hand, <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not wise. Therefore, Socrates sought to find someone wiser than himself, so that he could take that person as evidence to the Oracle at Delphi. Hence why Socrates minutely queried everyone who appeared to be a wise person. In that vein, he tested the minds of politicians, poets, and scholars, for wisdom; although he occasionally found genius, Socrates found no one who possessed wisdom; yet, each man was thought wise by the people, and each man thought himself wise; therefore, he (Socrates) was the better man, because he was aware that he was not wise.|$|E
50|$|Pain {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be strongly transparent: when someone <b>is</b> in pain, <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> immediately that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> in pain, and if <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not in pain, <b>he</b> will <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not.|$|R
50|$|At this point, {{there are}} {{numerous}} {{different versions of the}} story. In some, Ashwatthama mistakes the sleeping Upapandavas as the Pandavas and kills them.

500|$|Kennedy's {{assassination}} {{had always}} {{had a profound effect}} on Stone: [...] "The Kennedy murder was one of the signal events of the postwar generation, my generation." [...] Stone met Garrison and grilled him with a variety of questions for three hours. Garrison stood up to Stone's questioning and then got up and left. His pride and dignity impressed the director. Stone's impressions from their meeting were that Garrison [...] "made many mistakes. He trusted a lot of weirdos and followed a lot of fake leads. But he went out on a limb, way out. And he kept going, even when <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> facing long odds." ...|$|E
500|$|Lydon, in turn, would dismiss McLaren's influence: [...] "We {{made our}} own scandal {{just by being}} ourselves. Maybe it was that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> redundant, so he overcompensated. All the talk about the French Situationists being {{associated}} with punk is bollocks. It's nonsense!" [...] Cook concurs: [...] "Situationism {{had nothing to do}} with us. The Jamie Reids and Malcolms were excited because we were the real thing. I suppose we were what they were dreaming of." [...] According to Lydon, [...] "If we had an aim, it was to force our own, working-class opinions into the mainstream, which was unheard of in pop music at the time." ...|$|E
500|$|Shankly was 60 when Liverpool won the 1974 FA Cup {{and said}} in his {{autobiography}} that, on returning to the dressing room {{at the end of}} the match, he [...] "felt tired from all the years". His mind was made up and <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to retire. His wife, Nessie, had asked him to retire a year earlier but he decided that was not the right time. Tommy Smith said that Shankly's feelings for Nessie were undoubtedly a major reason for his decision. In 1974, he decided that he could leave Liverpool with pride in a job well done and only one regret, which was that he did not win the European Cup.|$|E

50|$|Edgar Ritfeld, {{one of the}} 25 suspects, {{said that}} he did not want amnesty because <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> innocent. <b>He</b> wanted the trial to be {{continued}} so that his innocence could be proven.

500|$|Serena is {{immediately}} taken by Haley's published short fiction. [...] She {{travels to the}} University of Sussex, where he works, to offer him a stipend from the fictional Freedom International Foundation. [...] Soon the two begin a romantic affair, but things gradually start to unravel. Serena discovers that Professor Canning (who, it turns out, broke off their affair only because <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> dying from cancer) {{was in fact a}} Soviet spy, and she was recruited because the agency wanted to keep tabs on Canning. Then, when Haley's first novel comes out, it is a great critical success, but its dystopian, anti-capitalist theme is not well received by the agency. Finally, his affair with Serena is exposed by the press, and the whole Sweet Tooth program is threatened.|$|E
500|$|Phillips, meanwhile, {{was always}} on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader {{audience}} the sound of the black musicians on whom Sun focused. As Keisker reported, [...] "Over and over I remember Sam saying, 'If I could find a white man who had the Negro sound and the Negro feel, I could make a billion dollars.'" [...] In June, he acquired a demo recording by Jimmy Sweeney of a ballad, [...] "Without You", that he thought might suit the teenage singer. Presley came by the studio, but was unable to do it justice. Despite this, Phillips asked Presley to sing as many numbers as <b>he</b> <b>knew.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians, guitarist Winfield [...] "Scotty" [...] Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, to work something up with Presley for a recording session.|$|E
500|$|In 1935, {{due to the}} {{increasing}} popularity of the Gretna Green [...] "irregular marriages", a special committee headed by Lord Morison was appointed to look at marriage in Scotland. Rennison gave evidence before the committee in 1936. There he claimed that {{he was known as}} [...] "the Gretna priest", but did not dress like one and stated that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not one. He also confirmed that he had been removing the word [...] "priest" [...] from marriage certificates and telling couples that they needed to confirm their marriage with the registrar at Dumfries. The committee's findings led to the Marriage (Scotland) Act 1939, which outlawed the process of [...] "irregular marriages". When the new law came into force in 1940, Rennison had performed 5,147 marriages. [...] His role then changed to a symbolic one, [...] "blessing" [...] marriages and acting as caretaker of the forge. He also regularly appeared at court to ensure the marriages he performed were judicially recognised.|$|E
