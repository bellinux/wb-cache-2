40|$|Abstract. – Background and Objectives: Central {{muscle relaxants}} are a {{clinical}} option {{in patients with}} spastic palsy. <b>Eperisone</b> is a cen-tral muscle relaxant used in several conditions, but its therapeutic potential in spastic palsy needs to be verified. This dose-ranging trial compares two doses of <b>eperisone</b> in patients with spastic palsy associated to cerebral or spinal diseases. Patients and Methods: In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, three-way cross-over study, patients (18 - 75 years) with spastic palsy received <b>eperisone</b> 150 mg/day, <b>eperisone</b> 300 mg/day, or placebo for 8 weeks. Treatment periods lasted for 14 days. Objective clinical parameters (intensity of spasticity and physiological reflexes) and functional parame-ters (walking capability, capability to climb stairs, rigidity) were measured. Tolerability was also evaluated. Results: Eighteen patients were enrolled. The reduction in the intensity of spasticity versus {{the beginning of each}} treatment cycle was sig-nificant with <b>eperisone</b> 300 mg/day (p = 0. 004). Similar findings were observed in the evaluation of patellar reflex (p = 0. 01), while the other reflex-es were not significantly different. Walking capa-bility was significantly improved with <b>eperisone</b> 300 mg/day (p < 0. 05). No significant differences were observed in the capability to climb stairs and in rigidity. A trend towards a reduction in pain was noted with <b>eperisone</b> 300 mg/day ver-sus placebo. The incidence of adverse events was similar in all groups. Discussion: <b>Eperisone</b> 300 mg/day might be an effective and well-tolerated treatment for spastic palsy. Larger studies are required to fur-ther characterize the efficacy of <b>eperisone</b> in this therapeutic area...|$|E
40|$|Background : <b>Eperisone</b> {{hydrochloride}} is a centrally acting {{muscle relaxant}} inhibiting the pain reflex pathway, having a vasodilator effect. Aims : To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of <b>eperisone</b> {{in patients with}} acute musculoskeletal spasm associated with low back pain. Settings and Design : Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentric trial conducted at five tertiary care orthopedic centers across India. Materials and Methods : It was planned to enroll 240 patients of either sex between 18 - 60 years with acute musculoskeletal spasm (AMSP) with low back pain (LBP) due to spondylosis deformans, prolapsed disc or muscle sprain. Patients with other associated unrelated spasm conditions were excluded. Assessments were done for finger-to-floor distance (FFD), lumbar pain, Lasegue′s sign, tenderness of vertebral muscles, need for rescue medication and response to therapy for efficacy and tolerability. Statistical Analysis : Parametric data were analyzed by ′t′ test and ANOVA, and non-parametric {{data were analyzed using}} Mann-Whitney ′U′ test and Kruskall-Wallis test. Proportions were compared using Fischer′s (Chi-square) test. Results : Two hundred and forty patients were randomized to receive <b>eperisone</b> 150 mg/day in three divided doses (n= 120) or placebo (n= 120) for 14 days, of which 15 patients did not complete and 225 patients completed the study (<b>eperisone,</b> 112 and placebo, 113). Significantly greater improvement in FFD (P< 0. 001) from baseline on Day 14 was seen with <b>eperisone</b> (150. 66 to 41. 75) compared to placebo (138. 51 to 101. 60). Improvements in other parameters were greater with the <b>eperisone</b> group. For 89 (79. 46 %) patients the therapy was rated as good-excellent with <b>eperisone</b> compared to 43 (38. 05 %) patients with placebo. Nausea, abdominal pain, headache and dizziness were the common adverse events with both therapies. Rescue drug was needed by 40 (35. 71 %) <b>eperisone</b> patients and 83 (73. 45 %) placebo patients. Conclusions : <b>Eperisone</b> hydrochloride was effective and well tolerated for the treatment of patients with AMSP with LBP...|$|E
40|$|A {{rapid and}} {{reproducible}} stability indicating TLC-densitometric method {{was developed for}} the determination of <b>eperisone</b> hydrochloride and paracetamol in presence of their degraded products in bulk drugs and pharmaceutical formulations. Uniform degradation conditions were maintained by refluxing reaction mixtures for 8 h at 60 °C including acidic, alkaline hydrolysis. Oxidation at room temperature, photochemical and dry heating degradation studies were also carried out. A sensitive and robust stability indicating TLC-densitometric method for simultaneous quantification of <b>eperisone</b> hydrochloride and paracetamol in bulk drugs and pharmaceutical formulations has been developed and validated. Separation was done on TLC aluminum sheets, pre-coated with silica gel 60 F- 254 using ethyl acetate: toluene: methanol (2 : 2 : 1 v/v/v). Spots at Rf 0. 42 ± 0. 04 and Rf 0. 60 ± 0. 02 were recognized as paracetamol and <b>eperisone</b> hydrochloride, respectively. Densitometric analysis of chromatoplates {{was carried out in}} absorbance mode at isobastic point 260 nm. The developed method was optimized and validated as per ICH guidelines. Method was found linear over the concentration range of 100 - 350 ng / spot for <b>eperisone</b> hydrochloride and 600 - 2100 ng / spot for paracetamol with the correlation coefficient (r 2) of 0. 999 and 0. 999 for <b>eperisone</b> hydrochloride and paracetamol, respectively. The developed TLC method can be applied for routine analysis of <b>eperisone</b> hydrochloride and paracetamol in presence of their degraded products in their combined pharmaceutical formulations...|$|E
40|$|<b>Eperisone</b> and {{afloqualone}} act by relaxing both skeletal and vascular smooth {{muscles to}} improve circulation and suppress pain reflex. These drugs are typically prescribed with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as painkillers. However, {{there have been}} no reports on serious adverse reactions to oral muscle relaxants; {{and this is the first}} report to describe three allergic reactions caused by <b>eperisone</b> and afloqualone. All three patients had histories of allergic reactions after oral intake of multiple painkillers, including oral muscle relaxants and NSAIDs, for chronic muscle pain. An open-label oral challenge test was performed with each drug to confirm which drugs caused the systemic reactions. All patients experienced the same reactions within one hour after oral intake of <b>eperisone</b> or afloqualone. The severity of these reactions ranged from laryngeal edema to hypotension. To confirm that the systemic reaction was caused by <b>eperisone</b> or afloqualone, skin prick testing and intradermal skin tests were performed with <b>eperisone</b> or afloqualone extract in vivo, and basophil activity tests were performed after stimulation with these drugs in vitro. In one patient with laryngeal edema, the intradermal test with afloqualone extract had a positive result, and CD 63 expression levels on basophils increased in a dose-dependent manner by stimulation with afloqualone. We report three allergic reactions caused by oral muscle relaxants that might be mediated by non-immunoglobulin E-mediated responses. Since oral muscle relaxants such as <b>eperisone</b> and afloqualone are commonly prescribed for chronic muscle pain and can induce severe allergic reactions, we should prescribe them carefully...|$|E
40|$|The central {{muscle relaxant}} {{activity}} of the antispastic agent tizanidine was {{compared with that of}} two novel clinical agents, afloqualone and <b>eperisone,</b> in the mouse and rabbit. Oral tizanidine strongly inhibited morphine-elicited Straub tail induction in the mouse, showing a me-dian effective dose {EDsJ of 1. 2 mg/kg, Intravenous tizanidine also inhibited hind limb extensor reflex activity in the rabbit with an EDso of 0. 02 mg/kg. Afloqualone and <b>eperisone,</b> however, were much weaker in the mouse assay with EDso values of 8. 2 and 58. 1 mg/kg, re-spectively. At respective intravenous doses of 2. 0 and 1. 0 mg/kg, afloqualone and <b>eperisone</b> caused maximally 32 % and 41 % inhibition of reflex activity in the rabbit. On this basis, afloqualone might be ex-pected to exhibit moderate myotonolytic activity in rheumatological indications, but to be of questionable value in spasticity. Similarly, clinical myotonolytic activity of <b>eperisone</b> would only be expected at high doses unless its functional bioavailability were to be much better in man than in either the mouse or rabbit.

40|$|The present {{manuscript}} describes simple, sensitive, rapid, accurate, {{precise and}} economical area under curve method for the simultaneous estimation of <b>Eperisone</b> Hydrochloride and Diclofenac Sodium in combined capsule dosage form. The proposed area under curve method involves {{the measurement of}} area at selected analytical wavelength ranges and performing the analysis using “Cramer’s Rule”. Two analytical wavelength ranges selected were 251. 0 - 261. 0 nm and 276. 0 - 286. 0 nm for the estimation of <b>Eperisone</b> Hydrochloride and Diclofenac Sodium, respectively. The linearity of the proposed method {{was found in the}} range of 2 - 20 µg/ml for both <b>Eperisone</b> Hydrochloride and Diclofenac Sodium, respectively.

40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} various sodium channel {{blocking}} agents on acute thermal and mechanical nociception, as assessed using the plantar and tail pressure tests, respectively, {{were compared with}} the effects of morphine. The drugs used were mexiletine, lidocaine, carbamazepine, phenytoin, <b>eperisone,</b> tolperisone, and zonisamide. The sodium channel blocking agents exhibited a rather preferential elevation of the threshold for thermal nociception. By contrast, morphine produced similar analgesic effects on thermal and mechanical nociception. In the sciatic nerve isolated from mice, mexiletine, lidocaine, <b>eperisone,</b> and tolperisone impaired the propagation of low frequency action potentials (evoked at 0. 2 Hz). Carbamazepine, phenytoin, and zonisamide generated a more frequency-dependent local anesthetic action with their obvious effects on higher frequency action potentials (evoked at 5 and/or 10 Hz). Our results show that sodium channel blocking agents have a preferential antinociceptive action against thermal stimulation that is likely to be attributed to their local anesthetic action...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} and tolerability of etodolac versus etodolac {{in combination with}} <b>eperisone</b> in patients of Osteoarthritis knee. Patients and Methods. A prospective, randomized, open label, parallel group, comparative {{study was conducted in}} 60 patients of knee OA over a period of 2 months. Thirty patients received etodolac 600 [*]mg once daily and 30 patients received <b>eperisone</b> 50 [*]mg thrice daily in addition to etodolac 600 [*]mg once daily for 8 weeks. Efficacy assessment was done on the basis of improvement in mean scores of spontaneous pain on Visual analog scale (VAS), pain on movement, functional capacity, joint tenderness, swelling, erythema on Likert scale, and patient's overall arthritic condition on a five-point investigator scale at the end of study period as compared with the baseline scores. Assessment of tolerability was done by recording the occurrence of adverse events. Data was analyzed using Chi square test and students t-test. Results. All the enrolled patients completed the study and were compliant to the treatment regimens that they were allocated to. Both the treatment groups showed a statistically significant improvement in all the efficacy parameters at the end of 8 weeks as compared to baseline (P< 0. 05) with no statistically significant difference between the groups. Adverse events were few and mild in nature. Conclusion. Combination of etodolac and <b>eperisone</b> is as effective as etodolac alone in patients of OA knee. Thus, it is concluded that additional use of muscle relaxant has no adjuvant value in patients of OA knee and is not recommended.

Among the 29 antipsychotics tested in inhibition studies, bromperidol and haloperidol were the most potent inhibitors (Ki= 0. 9 nM, 1. 0 nM, respectively). The conventional antipsychotics moperone, timiperone etc. and the novel promising drugs YM- 09151, Y- 516, BMY- 14802 and remoxipride potently inhibited [(3) H] haloperidol binding with the Ki in the range of low to moderate nanomolar.

These results, taken together with the evidence that the antiischemic agents ifenprodil and dextromethorphan antagozine NMDA responses and NMDA receptor complex is a possible site of action for neuroprotective agents, strongly suggest that σ receptors may be potential sites of action for antiischemic as well as antipsychotic drugs, i. e., σ receptors mediate the neuroprotective effects of certain antiischemic agents by affecting the NMDA receptor complex...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: <b>Eperisone</b> Hydrochloride (EPE) is {{a potent}} new {{generation}} antispasmodic drug which {{is used in the}} treatment of moderate to severe pain in combination with Paracetamol (PAR). Both drugs are available in tablet dosage form in combination with a dose of 50 mg for EPE and 325 mg PAR respectively. Methods: The method is based upon Q-absorption ratio method for the simultaneous determination of the EPE and PAR. Absorption ratio method is used for the ratio of the absorption at two selected wavelength one of which is the iso-absorptive point and other being the λmax of one of the two components. EPE and PAR shows their iso-absorptive point at 260 nm in methanol, the second wavelength used is 249 nm which is the λmax of PAR in methanol. Results: The linearity was obtained in the concentration range of 5 - 25 μg/mL for EPE and 2 - 10 μg/mL for PAR. The proposed method was effectively applied to tablet dosage form for estimation of both drugs. The accuracy and reproducibility results are close to 100 % with 2 % RSD. Results of the analysis were validated statistically and found to be satisfactory. The results of proposed method have been validated as per ICH guidelines. Conclusion: A simple, precise and economical spectrophotometric method has been developed for the estimation of EPE and PAR in pharmaceutical formulation...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Trials on sling {{exercise}} (SE), commonly {{performed to}} manage chronic {{low back pain}} (LBP), yield conflicting results. This study aimed to review the effects of SE on chronic LBP. METHODS: The randomized controlled trials comparing SE with other treatments or no treatment, published up to August 2013, were identified by electronic searches. Primary outcomes were pain, function, and return to work. The weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) were calculated, using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Risk of bias was rated as high in 9 included trials, where some important quality components such as blinding were absent and sample sizes were generally small. We found no clinically relevant differences in pain or function between SE {{and other forms of}} exercise, traditional Chinese medical therapy, or in addition to acupuncture. Based on two trials, SE was more effective than thermomagnetic therapy at reducing pain (short-term: WMD - 13. 90, 95 % CI - 22. 19 to - 5. 62; long-term: WMD - 26. 20, 95 % CI - 31. 32 to - 21. 08) and improving function (short-term: WMD - 10. 54, 95 % CI - 14. 32 to - 6. 75; long-term: WMD - 25. 75, 95 % CI - 30. 79 to - 20. 71). In one trial we found statistically significant differences between SE and physical agents combined with drug therapy (meloxicam combined with <b>eperisone</b> hydrochloride) but of borderline clinical relevance for pain (short-term: WMD - 15. 00, 95 % CI - 19. 64 to - 10. 36) and function (short-term: WMD - 10. 00; 95 % CI - 13. 70 to - 6. 30). There was substantial heterogeneity among the two trials comparing SE and thermomagnetic therapy; both these trials and the trial comparing SE with physical agents combined with drug therapy had serious methodological limitations. INTERPRETATION: Based on limited evidence from 2 trials, SE was more effective for LBP than thermomagnetic therapy. Clinically relevant differences in effects between SE and other forms of exercise, physical agents combined with drug therapy, traditional Chinese medical therapy, or in addition to acupuncture could not be found. More high-quality randomized trials on the topic are warranted...|$|E
