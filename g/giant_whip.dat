50|$|Whip {{scorpions}} {{are found}} in tropical and subtropical areas excluding Europe and Australia. Also, only a single species is known from Africa: Etienneus africanus, probably a Gondwana relict endemic to Senegal, the Gambia and Guinea-Bissau. They usually dig underground burrows with their pedipalps, to which they transport their prey. They may also burrow under logs, rotting wood, rocks, and other natural debris. They prefer humid, dark places and avoid light. Mastigoproctus giganteus, the <b>giant</b> <b>whip</b> scorpion, is found in more arid areas, including Arizona and New Mexico.|$|E

A vivid and blinding light flashed from the whirling, inky clouds above. The deep cannonade of roaring thunder belched forth its fearsome challenge. The deluge came--all {{hell broke loose}} upon the jungle.|$|R

50|$|Floridobolus penneri was {{described}} in 1957 by Nell B. Causey based on individuals collected near the Archbold Biological Station. Mature individuals generally range from 75 to 92 mm long and 10.8 to 11.6 mm wide. Its known natural predators include larval Phengodes laticollis (glowworm beetles) and adult Mastigoproctus giganteus (<b>giant</b> <b>whip</b> scorpions). F. penneri has been assessed by NatureServe as critically imperiled globally and nationally due {{to a range of}} less than 1,000 square kilometers (400 square miles), few populations known, and historic decline in Florida scrub habitat.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2015, the F+ Gallery in Santa Ana, California (founded by owner/director Micah Kersh) hosted an all insect-art exhibit {{entitled}} [...] "Aliens Of AkahtiLÃ¢ndia". The exhibit featured {{over forty}} original sculpture, photo, and mixed-media works by Ithaka - entirely inspired by insects he had observed and photographed {{on his property}} in AkahtiLandia, Brazil, purchased in 2010. Six guest creators were in turn invited to do individual interpretations {{of some of these}} same insects. Participating artists included; David Clyde Kersh, Erica L. Ellingson, Ian Morris, Nathan Paul Gibbs, Will Thompson and artist/entomologist/Hollywood insect wrangler Steven R. Kutcher. The opening event also included a live presentation by actress/insect handler Diana Terranova who encouraged attendees to get over their phobias by petting and even holding large, exotic live bugs including tarantulas and <b>giant</b> <b>whip</b> scorpions Thelyphonida.|$|E

Through Del Norte and Humboldt counties they went, and through Mendocino into Sonoma--counties larger than Eastern states--threading the <b>giant</b> woods, <b>whipping</b> innumerable trout-streams, and crossing countless rich valleys. Ever Saxon sought {{the valley of}} the moon. Sometimes, when all seemed fair, the lack was a railroad, sometimes madrono and manzanita trees, and, usually, there was too much fog.|$|R
50|$|The Cures, mascots, and Sakura {{go to the}} KiraKira Patisserie to {{eat dinner}} and dessert. Sakura is saddened by {{watching}} the Cures interact and remembers Shizuku. She steps outside and Ichika follows after her after seeing her leave. Sakura tells Ichika {{the story of how}} she met Shizuku, how Shizuku saved her, and their promise to see the cherry blossoms bloom. Ichika then says that tears and sadness causes happy moments to be sweeter. The Miracle Light glows and it shoots a beam of light to the tree stump. This forms a door. Sakura tries to open it but can't so Haruka gives Sakura her Dress-Up Key. Meanwhile, Karasu Tengu notices that Samidare is staring sadly at her origami crane. Karasu Tengu pulls out a magatama and uses that to put Samidare to sleep, hinting that Samidare might not be fighting of her own will.Sakura opens the door and the mascots stay behind while the Cures go to Sakuragahara. When they arrive, they are met by Akainu and Kiinu. Akainu and Kiinu then merge into Ooinu and Karasu Tengu makes an entrance. Everyone, including the tengu, is confused about Akainu and Kiinu being able to talk. Karasu Tengu greets Sakura and says she was chased after because they wanted to own her ability to open portals so they can travel to different worlds. Sakura refuses and rushes to a door Karasu Tengu made. She arrives in our world with Cure Whip, who ran after her. They ask the audience to help them by cheering them on. They return to fight and simultaneously, Karasu Tengu pulls out their microphone to report on the events like a sports commentator. The Cures try to pin down Ooinu, but this is proven difficult. The Cures, except Cure Flora because she was stuck in a tree, grab onto the floating stones around Ooinu's head. Ooinu spins the stones in hopes of shaking them off. This ends up sending the Cures and Ooinu flying through the air. Ooinu crashes while the Cures land safely. Samidare appears and proceeds to turn most of the Cures into origami. After the attack, only Whip and Sakura remained. The two try to escape, but Samidare jumps {{to the top of the}} torii path, leaving them with no choice but to fight back. Whip uses her hearing to trace Samidare's attack, and upon hearing her positioning her right foot to throw her crane, Whip leaps up and kick Samidare, shattering half of her mask. The injured Samidare opens her eye, which Sakura recognizes as Shizuku's, and she is shocked over the fact that Shizuku is now evil. Karasu Tengu arrives to mock them and attempts to control Samidare again, but Whip attacks Karasu Tengu before they could do anything. Their spell causes the weather to change to rain. As it pours, Whip is still determined to save Shizuku and tries to get Sakura to join her, but she still feels depressed over how she doesn't remember her anymore. However, Whip encourages her, but before anything is done, Karasu Tengu attacks Whip and sends her crashing into the mud. Karasu Tengu then proceeds to taunt her, but a determined Whip stands up and vows to help her family and friends. Her declaration causes the Miracle Saku Light to glow and return Sakuragahara to normal. Sakura takes this opportunity to pounce on top of Samidare and try to get her to remember her true form as Shizuku. When she gets through to her, the second half of the mask shatters and Shizuku returns. In addition to that, the other Pretty Cure have been turned back to normal, and Karasu Tengu turns into their powered-up form. As the Cures get ready to take Karasu Tengu on, Sakura and Shizuku meet up with them, and the latter tells the group that she has a plan, leading Whip to call a one-minute timeout. During that time, they discuss the plan and once they were done, Whip and Sakura tell the audience to support them using the Miracle Lights. After that, they begin their attack, with the Cures charging at Karasu Tengu, and Sakura and Shizuku running down the torii path. The Princess and Mahou Tsukai Cures attack first, followed by the KiraKira Cures, who use the Goldfish Daifuku Animal Sweet to produce a giant fist of Kirakiraru to strike Karasu Tengu. When that is not enough, the other Cures arrive to lend their support. As Sakura and Shizuku run down the torii path, Sakura recalls taking it with Shizuku back when she was scared, but now that she has encountered the Cures, she has become braver. After Sakura took a moment to catch her breath, she makes it to the door and uses the Miracle Saku Light to open it.Meanwhile, all of the Cures are now guiding a <b>giant</b> form of <b>Whip</b> made of Kirakiraru. Whip is afraid at first because the form's arms were too short, but when Karasu Tengu attacks, her massive hair blocks the hit instead. Just then, Sakura and Shizuku appear through a portal above them and they attack Karasu Tengu themselves. Karasu Tengu tries to fend the two off, but Shizuku is able to bite a weak spot, the nose, and it causes Karasu Tengu to revert back to their normal form. This gives the Cures the opportunity to attack and they collide with Karasu Tengu in an explosion of fireworks, defeating the mountain spirit once and for all.After the battle, the Cures, along with Sakura and Shizuku, have their flower viewing, with them all interacting with each other. During the viewing, Whip thinks about trying to become stronger and braver by herself, and it didn't turn out well, but when she tried it with her friends, it started to work. Whip then tells Sakura that she helped make her dream of viewing the flowers with all of her friends come true and thanked her for it.The ending shows various pictures of the Cures eating and enjoying the flower viewing.|$|R
