5000|$|Reduced heat rejection. Lowered peak {{combustion}} temperatures {{not only}} reduces NOx formation, it also reduces {{the loss of}} thermal energy to combustion chamber surfaces, leaving more available for conversion to mechanical work during the <b>expansion</b> <b>stroke.</b>|$|E
50|$|Efficiency is {{increased}} {{by having the}} same effective compression ratio and a larger expansion ratio. This allows more work to be extracted from the expanding gases as they are expanded to almost atmospheric pressure. In an ordinary spark ignition engine {{at the end of}} the <b>expansion</b> <b>stroke</b> of a wide open throttle cycle, the gases are at around five atmospheres when the exhaust valve opens. Because the stroke is limited to that of the compression, still some work could be extracted from the gas. Delaying the closing of the intake valve in the Miller cycle in effect shortens the compression stroke compared to the <b>expansion</b> <b>stroke.</b> This allows the gases to be expanded to atmospheric pressure, increasing the efficiency of the cycle.|$|E
50|$|The claimed {{advantages}} of the engine include reduction in fuel consumption by at least 40%, two <b>expansion</b> <b>strokes</b> in six strokes, multi-fuel usage capability, and a dramatic reduction in pollution.|$|R

5000|$|The {{abstract}} reads: [...] "A virtual three-stroke engine with {{intake and}} compression strokes approximately {{one half of}} the power stroke of approximately 12 to one expansion ratio and with total firing cycle stroke lengths equal to approximately three <b>expansion</b> <b>strokes</b> to minimize engine throttling and frictional losses over the real world drive cycle and provide high torque from a one-to-one drive shaft RPM to engine firing cycle RPM provided by a cam type driver for controlling the piston motions and extracting the power from the piston".|$|R
5000|$|Reduced {{chemical}} dissociation. The lower peak temperatures {{result in}} more of the released energy remaining as sensible energy near TDC (Top Dead-Center), rather than being bound up (early in the <b>expansion</b> <b>stroke)</b> in the dissociation of combustion products. This effect is minor compared to the first two.|$|E
50|$|The higher {{compression}} ratio in diesels means they {{are harder to}} start, but once they are running the energy expended in compressing air is regained during the <b>expansion</b> <b>stroke</b> when the compressed air is allowed to 'spring' back, so the higher {{compression ratio}} doesn't cause any engine braking.|$|E
5000|$|Atkinson's third {{design was}} named the [...] "Utilite Engine". Atkinson {{realized}} an improvement was needed to make his cycle more applicable to a high-speed engine. The final engine produced by the British Gas Engine company was the Utilite Engine. With this design, Atkinson {{was able to make}} a more conventional engine yet preserve the efficiency of having a short compression stroke and a long <b>expansion</b> <b>stroke</b> in a rather ingenious way. It operates much like a standard two-stroke except that the exhaust port is located at about the middle of the stroke. During the <b>expansion</b> <b>stroke,</b> a valve (which remains closed until the piston reaches the end of the stroke) prevents pressure from escaping as the piston moves past the exhaust port. Once the valve is opened, it remains open as the piston heads back toward compression, letting fresh air charge the cylinder and exhaust escape until the port is covered. A rich fuel/air mixture is injected by a small piston pump after the start of compression. This resulted in a two-stroke engine with a short compression and longer <b>expansion</b> <b>stroke.</b> The Utilite Engines tested as even more efficient than Atkinson's previous designs. Very few Utilite Engines were produced, and none is known to survive. The British patent is from 1892, #2492. No US patent for the Utilite Engine is known.|$|E
50|$|A five-cylinder engine gets a {{power stroke}} every 144 degrees (720° ÷ 5 = 144°). Since each power stroke lasts 180 degrees, {{this means that}} a power stroke is always in effect. Because of uneven levels of torque during the <b>expansion</b> <b>strokes</b> divided among the five cylinders, there are {{increased}} second-order vibrations. At higher engine speeds, there is an uneven third-order vibration from the crankshaft which occurs every 144 degrees. Because the power strokes have some overlap, a five-cylinder engine may run more smoothly than a non-overlapping four-cylinder engine, but only at limited mid-range speeds where second and third-order vibrations are lower.|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{thermodynamic}} {{methodology of}} TDC determination in IC engines {{based on a}} motoring pressure-time diagram is presented. This method consists in entropy calculation and temperature- entropy diagram analysis. When the TDC position is well calibrated, compression and <b>expansion</b> <b>strokes</b> under motoring conditions are symmetrical {{with respect to the}} peak temperature in the (T,S) diagram. Moreover, in case of error on the TDC position, a loop appears which has no thermodynamic significance. Hence an easy methodology has been conceived to obtain the actual position of TDC. This methodology is applied to motoring measurements in order to present its performance, which are compared to usual methods...|$|R
50|$|A {{four-stroke}} {{spark-ignition engine}} is an Otto cycle engine. It consists of following four strokes: suction or intake <b>stroke,</b> compression <b>stroke,</b> <b>expansion</b> or power <b>stroke,</b> exhaust stroke. Each stroke consists of 180 degree rotation of crankshaft rotation and hence a four-stroke cycle is completed through 720 degree of crank rotation. Thus for one complete cycle {{there is only}} one power stroke while the crankshaft turns by two revolutions.|$|R
50|$|The {{designers}} {{consider this}} to be a five-stroke design, regarding the simultaneous HP exhaust stroke and LP <b>expansion</b> <b>stroke</b> as a single stroke. This design provides higher fuel efficiency due to the higher overall expansion ratio of the combined cylinders. Expansion ratios comparable to diesel engines can be achieved, while still using gasoline (petrol) fuel. Five-stroke engines allegedly are lighter and have higher power density than diesel engines.|$|E
5000|$|The {{aim of the}} {{invention}} is to improve the emissions characteristics and efficiency of the internal combustion engine by reducing throttling and pumping losses. The patent states: [...] "Other methods of reducing pumping loss rely on variable valve timing, as in the Miller cycle...these are only partially successful because they still employ a full intake and compression stroke with the accompanying mechanical frictional losses". In the engine proposed by Ward, the intake stroke is physically shorter than the <b>expansion</b> <b>stroke.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1834, the French mining {{engineer}} Émile Clapeyron refers to Carnot’s motive power as [...] "mechanical action". As an example, during the <b>expansion</b> <b>stroke</b> of a piston engine he states that: [...] "the gas will {{have developed a}} quantity of mechanical action during its expansion given by the integral of {{the product of the}} pressure times the differential of the volume." [...] Clapeyron then goes on to use graphical methods to show how this [...] "mechanical action", i.e. work in modern terms, could be calculated.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effect of}} injection timing in diesel combustion. Ansys Fluent a computational fluid dynamics tool is used to study the combustion of diesel with three different injection timing. The fuel is injected before TDC, at TDC and after TDC. The parameters such as temperature, pressure, velocity, density, soot and NOx emission are compared. The specie transport model is used for modelling the combustion. Standard k-e (2 equ) is used for modelling the turbulence. The analysis is carried out by only considering the compression and <b>expansion</b> <b>strokes.</b> The pressure reaches the maximum when the fuel is injected before TDC and the maximum temperature is when injected at TDC. The NOx emission is less when the fuel is injected at TDC and the soot formation is when fuel injected before TDC...|$|R

This conference paper is also available from [URL] newly developed piece-wise method for calculating the effects of near-wall turbulence on the transport of enthalpy and hence the thermal boundary layer temperature profile in "motored" spark-ignition engines has been compared with methods that have previously been employed {{in the development of}} expressions for the gas-wall interface heat flux. Near-wall temperature profiles resulting from the inclusion of the respective expressions in a "quasi-dimensional" thermodynamic engine simulation have been compared and in one case show considerable differences throughout the compression and <b>expansion</b> <b>strokes</b> of the "motored" engine cycle. However, the corresponding heat fluxes calculated from the simulated temperature profiles all show good agreement with measured results. It is postulated that gas-wall interface heat flux is largely controlled by the boundary layer behavior close to the combustion chamber surfaces and the temperature profile in the outer regions of the boundary layer has considerably less influence. Comparisons have also been made between measured TDC near-wall temperature data (expressed in dimensionless form) and the wall function approach when modified for use in the cylinders of reciprocating engines. The high swirl case shows good agreement with the wall functions, but the low swirl case does not. This is attributed to the changing nature of the hydrodynamic boundary layer in the two instances with the low swirl case being more consistent with laminar behavior. Engine simulations incorporating the new method for the evaluation of near-wall turbulence effects have been used to demonstrate the thermal boundary layer behavior throughout the compression and <b>expansion</b> <b>strokes</b> of a "motored" cycle.

40|$|Of the two {{fundamental}} cycles employed in combustion turbines, namely, the explosion (or constant-volume) cycle and the constant-pressure cycle, {{the latter is}} considered more in detail and its efficiency is derived {{with the aid of}} the cycle diagrams for the several cases with adiabatic and isothermal compression and <b>expansion</b> <b>strokes</b> and with and without utilization of the exhaust heat. Account is also taken of the separate efficiencies of the turbine and compressor and of the pressure losses and heat transfer in the piping. The results show that without the utilization of the exhaust heat the efficiencies for the two cases of adiabatic and isothermal compression is offset by the increase in the heat supplied. It may be seen from the curves {{that it is necessary to}} attain separate efficiencies of at least 80 percent in order for useful results to be obtained. There is further shown the considerable effect on the efficiency of pressure losses in piping or heat exchangers...|$|R
50|$|The <b>expansion</b> <b>stroke</b> of {{the steam}} engine covers piston travel from {{top dead center}} to bottom dead center. When the piston reverses to return to top dead center, an exhaust valve needs to open so that the {{expanded}} steam from the previous stroke can be released from the cylinder. The WHE engine has an exhaust valve in each piston actuated by a protrusion on the connecting rod (see figure to right). On the exhaust stroke {{the angle of the}} connecting rod causes it to open the piston valve, allowing expanded steam to exhaust into the crankcase.|$|E
5000|$|Atkinson {{produced}} {{three different}} designs {{that had a}} short compression stroke and a longer <b>expansion</b> <b>stroke.</b> The first Atkinson-cycle engine, the differential engine, used opposed pistons. The second and most well-known design, was the cycle engine, which used an over-center arm to create four piston strokes in one crankshaft revolution. The reciprocating engine had the intake, compression, power, and exhaust strokes of the four-stroke cycle in a single turn of the crankshaft, and was designed to avoid infringing certain patents covering Otto-cycle engines. Atkinson's third and final engine, the utilite engine, operated much like any two-stroke engine. The common thread throughout Atkinson's designs is that the engines have an <b>expansion</b> <b>stroke</b> that is longer than the compression stroke, and by this method the engine achieves greater thermal efficiency than a traditional piston engine. Atkinson's engines were produced by the British Gas Engine Company and also licensed to other overseas manufacturers. Many modern engines now use unconventional valve timing to produce {{the effect of a}} shorter compression stroke/longer power stroke, Miller applied this technique to the four-stroke engine, so it is sometimes referred as the Atkinson/Miller cycle, US patent 2817322 dated Dec 24, 1957. In 1888, Charon filed a French patent and displayed an engine at the Paris Exhibition in 1889. The Charon gas engine (four- stroke) used a similar cycle to Miller, but without a supercharger. It {{is referred to as the}} [...] "Charon cycle" [...] Modern engine designers are realizing the potential fuel-efficiency improvements the Atkinson-type cycle can provide.|$|E
50|$|The Bajulaz six-stroke {{engine is}} similar to a regular {{combustion}} engine in design. There are, however, modifications to the cylinder head, with two supplementary fixed-capacity chambers: a combustion chamber and an air-preheating chamber above each cylinder. The combustion chamber receives a charge of heated air from the cylinder; the injection of fuel begins an isochoric (constant-volume) burn, which increases the thermal efficiency compared to a burn in the cylinder. The high pressure achieved is then released into the cylinder to work the power or <b>expansion</b> <b>stroke.</b> Meanwhile, a second chamber, which blankets the combustion chamber, has its air content heated to a high degree by heat passing through the cylinder wall. This heated and pressurized air is then used to power an additional stroke of the piston.|$|E
5000|$|Efficiency will {{be reduced}} due to pumping losses, as the air charge is {{compressed}} and expanded twice but energy is only extracted for power {{in one of the}} <b>expansions</b> per piston <b>stroke.</b>|$|R
5000|$|High {{piston speed}} around {{top dead centre}} (TDC) and a fast power <b>stroke</b> <b>expansion</b> enhances {{fuel-air}} mixing and reduces the time available for heat transfer losses {{and the formation of}} temperature-dependent emissions such as nitrogen oxides (NOx).|$|R
5000|$|The {{increased}} {{high pressure}} exerts a {{force on the}} piston and pushes it towards the BDC. Expansion of working fluid takes place isentropically and work {{is done by the}} system on the piston. The volume ratio [...] is called the [...] "isentropic expansion ratio". (For the Otto cycle {{is the same as the}} compression ratio [...] ). Mechanically this is the expansion of the hot gaseous mixture in the cylinder known as <b>expansion</b> (power) <b>stroke.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Rendering of an Ericsson engine. A cold gaseous working fluid, such as {{atmospheric}} air (shown in blue), enters the cylinder via a non-return valve at the top-right. The air is compressed by the piston (black) as the piston moves upward. The compressed air {{is stored in}} the pneumatic tank (at left). A two-way valve (gray) moves downward to allow pressurized air {{to pass through the}} regenerator where it is preheated. The air then enters the space below the piston, which is an externally heated expansion-chamber. The air expands and does work on the piston as it moves upward. After the <b>expansion</b> <b>stroke,</b> the two-way valve moves upward, thus closing off the tank and opening the exhaust port. As the piston moves back downward in the exhaust stroke, hot air is pushed back through the regenerator, which reclaims most of the heat, before passing out the exhaust port (left) as cool air.|$|E
30|$|The {{abnormal}} combustion did {{not contribute}} to the engine work, and it did not influence the pressure signal [35]: it induced surface diffusion flames that warmed up the nearby in-cylinder gas by thermal diffusion.

The result of the analysis was that cool flame combustion is present in all combustion processes and not a product of systematic error or due to the combustion of the partially combusted species in the recirculated exhaust gas. It does not entirely depend on the chemical composition of fuel and rather on the in-cylinder conditions in particular the ambient oxygen concentration. Lower ambient oxygen concentration causes the cool flame to advance with respect to the high temperature heat release, making it visible in the heat release profile.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the present work is to improve and validate a multi-zone model developed by the authors for HCCI combustion. The multi-zone model describes the heat and mass transfer mechanisms and simulates combustion and pollutant formation using a reduced chemistry reaction mechanism and chemical kinetics. The division of the combustion chamber into zones is based on geometrical considerations. Heat and mass is exchanged between zones and the cylinder wall according to their spatial configuration, throughout the compression and <b>expansion</b> <b>strokes,</b> i. e. for the closed part of engine operation. The model is improved by modelling crevice flow through {{the description of the}} motion of unburned and burned mixture {{in and out of the}} crevice regions. These regions are a significant source of unburned hydrocarbons and contribute to the formation of CO. Using the model, a description of the formation of pollutant emissions in the zones is described. For model validation, cylinder pressure, performance data and emissions obtained from the simulation are compared to experimental data taken from an engine operating on HCCI mode for three different load cases.

40|$|Partially Premixed Combustion (PPC) {{strategy}} {{offers the}} potential for simultaneously reduction of NOx and soot emissions with high efficiency. This low temperature combustion strategy involves a proper mixing of fuel and air prior to auto-ignition. During ignition delay (ID) the exact amount of premixing is crucial for the combustion behaviour and emission formation. 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆eIn this article, high-speed particle image velocimetry (HS-PIV) {{has been applied to}} characterise the in-cylinder flow and cycle-to-cycle variations in a light-duty optical engine during fired conditions. The engine is operated at 800 rpm and at a constant CA 50 (8 CAD aTDC). Multiple injections strategies (single, double and triple injections) have been applied to investigate their influence on the flow inside the piston bowl and squish region. The 2 D velocity fields are evaluated and investigated over a range of crank angles in the compression and <b>expansion</b> <b>strokes</b> {{in order to understand the}} cycle-to-cycle variations. To investigate the problem of cyclic- variations on in-cylinder flows the phase-invariant proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) technique was used. The POD decomposition technique provides a classification method based on an energy criterion by which the mean flow is seen as a superposition of coherent structures. From their temporal coefficients it is possible to characterize its dynamical behaviour...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSeveral {{previous}} studies have proven that pneumatic hybridization of an internal combustion engine is a technically viable and cost-efficient alternative to electric hybridization. Because the heat transfer process remains a first order factor while the engine operates in a motored or pneumatic mode without combustion, an accurate instantaneous heat transfer model is {{required in order to}} predict the in-cylinder pressure. This study shows that the original Woschni model is not suitable for describing the shape of the measured instantaneous heat flux versus crank angle while the engine operates in a motored pneumatic mode, because of the extinction of tumble motion near Top Dead Center (TDC). A modified form of the Woschni model is therefore proposed here that better describes the instantaneous heat flux during compression and <b>expansion</b> <b>strokes,</b> applicable to pneumatic and motored with fuel cut-off modes. First, the new constant parameter model is identified from experimental measurements performed in various motored mode conditions. Next, the pneumatic supercharged mode without combustion (ignition not performed) is investigated with the new model using the same identification values as for the motored mode. This study shows that the modified model remains fully applicable to the supercharged mode, despite of a certainly modified in-cylinder aerodynamic structure created by the opening of the charging valve under a high pressure ratio...|$|R
30|$|Also {{it shows}} that the torque {{increases}} with increasing ignition advance. This is due to increasing pressure in the compression stroke and consequently more net work is produced. It is necessary to mention that by further increase in spark advance, torque will not rise largely due to in-cylinder peak pressure during compression period and a decrease of pressure in <b>expansion</b> <b>stroke.</b> For this reason, determining the optimum ignition timing {{is one of the most}} important characteristics for an SI engine (Fig.  9).|$|E

40|$|Partially {{premixed}} combustion (PPC) {{is used to}} {{meet the}} increasing demands of emission legislation and to improve fuel efficiency. With gasoline fuels, PPC {{has the advantage of}} a longer premixed duration of the fuel/air mixture, which prevents soot formation. In addition, the overall combustion stability can be increased with a longer ignition delay, providing proper fuel injection strategies. In this work, the effects of multiple injections on the generation of in-cylinder turbulence at a single swirl ratio are investigated. High-speed particle image velocimetry (PIV) is conducted in an optical direct-injection (DI) engine to obtain the turbulence structure during fired conditions. Primary reference fuel (PRF) 70 (30 % n-heptane and 70 % iso-octane) is used as the PPC fuel. In order to maintain the in-cylinder flow as similarly as possible to the flow that would exist in a production engine, the quartz piston retains a realistic bowl geometry. The distortion caused by the complex shape of the optical piston is corrected by an advanced image-dewarping algorithm. The in-cylinder charge motion is evaluated and investigated over a range of crank angles in the compression and <b>expansion</b> <b>strokes</b> {{in order to understand the}} turbulence level, especially the late-cycle turbulence.

40|$|It {{is known}} to {{internal}} combustion researcher that the correct determination of the crank position when the piston is at Top Dead Centre (TDC) is very important, since an error of 1 crank angle degree (CAD) can cause up to a 10 % evaluation error on indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) and a 25 % error on the heat released by the combustion: the TDC position should be then known within a precision of 0. 1 CAD. This task {{can be accomplished by}} means of a dedicated capacitive sensor, which allows a measurement within the required 0. 1 degrees precision. Such a sensor has a substantial cost and its use is not really fast; a different approach can be followed using a thermodynamic method, whose input is the pressure curve sampled during the compression and <b>expansion</b> <b>strokes</b> of a “motored” (i. e. without combustion) cylinder. In this work the authors compare an original thermodynamic method with other ones available in literature, by means of both experimental and simulated pressure curves. A zero dimensional thermodynamic model was employed to obtain an extensive collection of numeric pressure curves by changing engine geometry (e. g. compression ratios from 10 to 20 were adopted), operative conditions and wall heat transfer laws. The in-cylinder mass leakage has been taken into account in the model. Moreover, in order to assess the reliability and robustness of each method, the typical measurement errors and disturbances related to indicating analysis have been taken into account. The capability of the investigated methods to provide the correct TDC position in presence of the above mentioned errors has been evaluated...|$|R
50|$|There is {{also the}} {{possibility}} of even greater fuel efficiency {{at the expense of}} outright power. The Helical Camshaft and the general principle of LIVC also allow the possible use of a very high compression ratio (CR). The idea here being to use a very high geometrical CR but limit the compression pressure by LIVC so as to avoid detonation. The expansion ratio after combustion still remains high. It is the expansion ratio that fundamentally converts the heat energy of the burning fuel/air mixture into usable mechanical energy. The more the hot gases are expanded by the moving piston the more the heat energy is converted into useful work and the higher the thermal efficiency is. This general principle is usually called the “Atkinson Cycle”. (Strictly speaking the Atkinson Cycle refers to an engine with mechanically different length compression and <b>expansion</b> <b>strokes.</b> In modern practice, the compression pressure is limited by a fixed amount of intake valve late closing - this has exactly the same effect as the different stroke lengths). With the Atkinson Cycle the added efficiency is at the expense of reduced overall power. For example, if an engine had a geometrical CR of 18:1 {{it would have to be}} restricted to about half its full charge of air/fuel mixture to avoid detonation. The resulting effect would be that at full load the engine would use half the fuel but the power would be not half but roughly two-thirds or three quarters that of the equivalent “normal” engine - the net result being an increase in thermal efficiency. Such an engine would be economical but it would still suffer from intake pumping losses.|$|R
