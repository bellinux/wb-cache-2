5|$|Two years later, on 4 June 1988, then-Governor General Jeanne Sauvé {{authorised}} {{the creation}} of the Canadian Heraldic Authority, made possible by letters patent signed by Queen Elizabeth II, on the advice of her Canadian Privy Council, and presented by her son, Prince Edward. As a result, Canada became the first Commonwealth realm outside the United Kingdom to have its own heraldic authority. Canada also provides <b>full</b> <b>equality</b> to women in terms of inheriting and transmitting arms. Additionally, all armigers within Canada may file for trademark protection of their grant of arms under the Trade-Marks Act.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{assumption}} that man is a social animal, Saint-Just argues that in nature {{there is no need for}} contracts, legislation, or acts of force. These constructs only become necessary when a society is in need of moral regeneration and serve merely as unsatisfactory substitutes for the natural bonds of free people. Such constructs permit small groups to assume unwarranted powers which, according to Saint-Just, leads to corruption within society. Because a return to the natural state is impossible, Saint-Just argues for a government composed of the most educated members of society, who could be expected to share an understanding of the larger social good. Outside the government itself, Saint-Just asserts there must be <b>full</b> <b>equality</b> between all men, including equal security in material possessions and personal independence. Property must be protected by the state but, in order to secure universal independence, all citizens (including women) must own property.|$|E

On 22 May, the Bundestag passed the law while rejecting proposals by The Greens for <b>full</b> adoption <b>equality.</b> Another law to grant <b>full</b> tax <b>equality</b> passed unanimously in the Bundestag, finishing the required legal changes following the June 2013 court ruling.|$|R

25|$|Institutional {{bilingualism}} {{in various}} forms therefore predates the Canadian Confederation in 1867. However, for many years English occupied a de facto privileged position, and French was not fully equal.

In the 1970s French in Quebec became the province's official language.|$|E

25|$|Jews in the Ottoman Empire were {{generally}} well-treated and were recognized {{under the law}} as non-Muslims. Despite some restrictions, the Jewish communities of the Empire prospered. They were granted significant autonomy, with various rights {{including the right to}} buy real estate, to build synagogues and to conduct trade throughout the Ottoman Empire. Jews, along with the other non-Muslim subjects of the Empire, were granted <b>full</b> <b>equality</b> under Ottoman law by 1856.|$|E

This compromise ended the religious wars in France. That same year the Treaty of Vervins ended the war with Spain, adjusted the Spanish-French border, and resulted in a belated recognition by Spain of Henry as king of France.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} of the early 1970s, the issue of race began to {{dominate}} all others and the regime started to repress its white opponents. By 1975, although officially democratic, the regime had started to lock up even peaceful opponents of white domination. Black Rhodesians regarded their legal situation as morally unjustifiable and wanted <b>full</b> <b>equality.</b> From August 1964 to December 1974, Robert Mugabe was imprisoned without trial. Although legal, it was emblematic of a regime that disregarded human rights as part of its fight against terrorism.|$|E

50|$|In 2009, Lippert {{chaired the}} House {{hearings}} on <b>full</b> Marriage <b>Equality,</b> and led its successful passage by the House on {{a vote of}} 94-52. Despite strong votes and passage by both the Senate (26-4) and the House (94-52), Gov. Jim Douglas vetoed the Marriage Equality bill on April 6, 2009. In Vermont, overriding a governor's veto requires a two thirds majority, not a simple majority of fifty percent. On April 7, 2009, the Senate overrode the veto on a vote of 23-5. Lippert worked with House leadership to marshall enough House votes, and the House followed suit, overriding the governor's veto 100-49. As a result, <b>full</b> Marriage <b>Equality</b> became Vermont law on April 7, 2009, with marriages taking place beginning on September 1, 2009.|$|R
25|$|President Steyn of the Orange Free State invited Milner and Kruger {{to attend}} a conference in Bloemfontein. The conference started on 30 May 1899, but {{negotiations}} quickly broke down, despite Kruger's offer of concessions. In September 1899, Chamberlain sent an ultimatum demanding <b>full</b> <b>equality</b> for British citizens resident in Transvaal. Kruger, seeing that war was inevitable, simultaneously issued his own ultimatum prior to receiving Chamberlain's. This gave Britain 48 hours to withdraw all their troops from the border of Transvaal; otherwise the Transvaal, allied with the Orange Free State, would declare war.|$|E
25|$|In 1823 he was {{appointed}} President of the Board of Trade and Treasurer of the Navy, and shortly afterwards he received {{a seat in the}} cabinet. In the same year he was returned for Liverpool as successor to Canning, and as the only man who could reconcile the Tory merchants to a free trade policy. Among the more important legislative changes with which he was principally connected were a reform of the Navigation Acts, admitting other nations to a <b>full</b> <b>equality</b> and reciprocity of shipping duties; the repeal of the labour laws; the introduction of a new sinking fund; the reduction of the duties on manufactures and on the importation of foreign goods, and the repeal of the quarantine duties.|$|E
25|$|Quakers in the United States of America {{are divided}} {{on the issue of}} homosexuality, with some (mostly Friends {{affiliated}} with programmed meetings) not approving of either homosexuality or the legalization of same sex unions. Friends associated with Friends General Conference (FGC), the more liberal group of Friends encompassing a large number of yearly meetings and approximately a fifth of all Quakers in the country, are the most tolerant with many monthly meetings and some yearly meetings providing <b>full</b> <b>equality</b> for homosexuals including marriage. FGC itself in 2004 made a statement on including LGBT quakers as equals in worship and acknowledging their past contributions to the conference. The largely FGC-based FLGBTQC (Friends for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Concerns) group holds meetings twice a year.|$|E

25|$|The 1967 Act {{extended}} only to England and Wales. Organisations {{such as the}} Campaign for Homosexual Equality and the Gay Liberation Front therefore {{continued to}} campaign for the goal of <b>full</b> <b>equality</b> in Scotland and Northern Ireland where all homosexual behaviour remained illegal. Same-sex sexual activities were legalised in Scotland on the same basis as in the 1967 Act, by section 80 of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980, which came into force on 1 February 1981. An analogous amendment was also made {{to the law of}} Northern Ireland, following the determination of a case by the European Court of Human Rights (see Dudgeon v. United Kingdom); the relevant legislation was an Order in Council, the Homosexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 1982, which came into force on 8 December 1982.|$|E
25|$|Grierson was {{an active}} {{supporter}} of the Argentine Freethinkers Association (AALP), which advocated rationalism, anticlericalism, a scientific approach to life, and <b>full</b> <b>equality</b> for women. The AALP sought to join the CNM, but were rejected on account of their anticlerical views. This provoked a new confrontation between Grierson and {{the membership of the}} CNM, upon which she joined the Women’s Socialist Centre. Grierson chaired the First International Feminist Conference of Argentina organized by the Association of University Women during the Argentine Centennial, in 1910. This provoked her departure from the CNM, which, with official support, had organized the rightist First Patriotic Women’s Congress. Grierson articulated her opposition to a turn to the right on the part of Argentine feminists in her 1910 treatise Decadencia del Consejo Nacional de Mujeres de la República Argentina (Degeneration of the Argentine National Women’s Council).|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Communists {{were moving}} towards open insurrection. The MPAJA had been disbanded in December 1945, and the MCP {{organised}} {{as a legal}} political party, but the MPAJA’s arms were carefully stored for future use. The MCP policy was for immediate independence with <b>full</b> <b>equality</b> for all races. This meant it recruited very few Malays. The Party’s strength was in the Chinese-dominated trade unions, particularly in Singapore, and in the Chinese schools, where the teachers, mostly born in China, saw the Communist Party of China {{as the leader of}} China’s national revival. In March 1947, reflecting the international Communist movement’s “turn to left” as the Cold War set in, the MCP leader Lai Tek was purged and replaced by the veteran MPAJA guerrilla leader Chin Peng, who turned the party increasingly to direct action. These rebels, under the leadership of the MCP, launched guerrilla operations designed to force the British out of Malaya. In July, following a string of assassinations of plantation managers, the colonial government struck back, declaring a State of Emergency, banning the MCP and arresting hundreds of its militants. The Party retreated to the jungle and formed the Malayan Peoples’ Liberation Army, with about 13,000 men under arms, all Chinese.|$|E
