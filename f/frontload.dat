40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{performance}} of <b>frontloading</b> and the standard WHO method for diagnosis of pulmonary TB at Mulago Hospital in order to validate the technique in this setting. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study in which 229 adult ($ 18 years) TB suspects were consecutively enrolled. Suspects submitted three sputum samples as follows: at initial presentation, one hour after the first sample, and the next morning. The first and next morning samples formed the standard WHO method, while {{the first and the}} one hour later samples formed the <b>frontloading</b> method. Sample processing was by the standard N-acetyl L-cystein (NALC) -NaOH method, and fluorescent microscopy was done for both methods, while cultures of the first sample on Lowenstein-Jensen slants acted as a gold standard. The sensitivity, specificity and predictive values for the WHO standard and <b>frontloading</b> methods were compared. Results: The sensitivity of both the <b>frontloading</b> and standard schemes was 91. 1 % while their specificities were 86. 2 % and 91. 7 % respectively. There was excellent agreement between the diagnostic capacity of the two methods (kappa statistic = 0. 87, P, 0. 0001). The positive predictive value for the <b>frontloading</b> scheme was 87. 2 % and that for the standard approach was 91. 9 %, while the negative predictive values were 90. 4 % and 90. 9 %, respectively.

40|$|Fluid force {{microscopy}} {{combines the}} positional accuracy and force sensitivity of an {{atomic force microscope}} (AFM) with nanofluidics via a microchanneled cantilever. However, adequate loading and cleaning procedures for such AFM micropipettes are required for various application situations. Here, a new <b>frontloading</b> procedure is described for an AFM micropipette functioning as a force- and pressure-controlled microscale liquid dispenser. This <b>frontloading</b> procedure seems especially attractive when using target substances featuring high costs or low available amounts. Here, the AFM micropipette could be filled from the tip side with liquid from a previously applied droplet with a volume {{of only a few}} μL using a short low-pressure pulse. The liquid-loaded AFM micropipettes could be then applied for experiments in air or liquid environments. AFM micropipette <b>frontloading</b> was evaluated with the well-known organic fluorescent dye rhodamine 6 G and the AlexaFluor 647 -labeled antibody goat anti-rat IgG {{as an example of a}} larger biological compound. After micropipette usage, specific cleaning procedures were tested. Furthermore, a storage method is described, at which the AFM micropipettes could be stored for a few hours up to several days without drying out or clogging of the microchannel. In summary, the rapid, versatile and cost-efficient <b>frontloading</b> and cleaning procedure for the repeated usage of a single AFM micropipette is beneficial for various application situations from specific surface modifications through to local manipulation of living cells, and provides a simplified and faster handling for already known experiments with fluid force microscopy...|$|R

The aim of the paper is to shed light on these questions using a multi-country reduced-form model. It considers explicitly that the Eurozone member states are facing a dual trade-off, first between labor market outcomes of consolidation and public debt dynamics and, second, between reducing public expenditures and increasing taxes. The main conclusion is that a tax-based backloaded consolidation is superior to all other strategies, be they spending-based or <b>frontloaded,</b> or both.

Allmusic rated the album with 3 {{and a half}} stars and wrote Just like the similarly titled 2009 album from Method Man and Redman, DJ Quik and Kurupt's Blaqkout is a throwback triumph that succeeds thanks to the hip-hop veterans' superior chemistry and informal attitude. Anyone expecting a courageous game changer will be disappointed by all the swaggering, sexual bragging, and irresponsible pimping the duo <b>frontload</b> onto the effort, but {{coming to terms with the}} overall weekend attitude is quick and easy, thanks to rock-solid hooks and Quik's production. On [...] "Ohh!" [...] he creates a head-bobbing backing track out of chopped-up vocals and Smooth jazz keyboards, offering a G-funk alternative to Timbaland's [...] "Indian Flute." [...] Key track [...] "Do You Know" [...] finds him blending blissed-out ambience and a Soul II Soul hook, but [...] "F**k Y'All" [...] employs Quik's classic formula with that West Coast funk over thumping bass. The A.V. Club rated the album with a (B+) and wrote DJ Quik has long been one of the most consistent producers in Hip hop, as well as a skilled (though sometimes ridiculously sexist) MC. But he’s seldom been in the lean, adventurous form he explores on BlaQKout, a collaboration with Dogg Pound member Kurupt. Quik’s tracks are head-turning throughout: The blistering single “9X Outta 10” features Kurupt at his steeliest and takes the minimal slam-beats aesthetic of Clipse’s 2002 hit “Grindin'” to a lush new place, especially when a couple of cut-up female vocals enter the mix. “Do You Know” is cinematic soul with his usual easy-gliding groove slipping around under it; “Ohh!” calls up early-’80s Zapp and early-’00s 2-step garage (more cut-up vocals); North African overtones spice the heavy stomp of “Hey Playa (Moroccan Blues).” The lyrics aren’t going to win awards for thematic originality, and there’s an especially egregious spoken-word bit poorly justifying the excessive use of the word “bitch,” but most of the time, Quik and Kurupt sound invigorated by each other. Or as Quik ends a verse in “Hey Playa,” in slow motion, “I’m that much quicker.” The Phoenix gave the album 4/4 stars and wrote LA hip-hop has two threads, and DJ Quik pulls both of them. The first is g-funk, a production style that relies on deep, open grooves and an endless parade of funk samples. The second is West Coast backpacker rap, which is what happens when guys with enormous vocabularies smoke a lot of weed. The fact that Quik has inhabited both worlds for two decades is a pretty nifty trick: he can go [...] "out there" [...] without disappearing completely, and he can talk about problems in the ghetto without sounding as if he lived at the Gap. On BlaQKout, his collaboration with the Philadelphia/LA MC Kurupt, his sonics range far and wide. [...] "Do You Know" [...] has a glamorous sweep that suggests something like wise retrospection, and it leads right into [...] "Watcha Wan Do," [...] which could be the funky soundtrack to a Zelda game. Eventually, there's [...] "9X Outta 10," [...] which sounds as if somebody had handed turntables to the Terminator. This one has Kurupt rapping as if he were hypnotized — [...] "It's gonna start again where it started at/Ended up, and restart again." [...] It all might seem like preamble when you finally get to [...] "Jupiter's Critic and the Mind of Mars," [...] which may be the weirdest slice of rap genius since [...] "A Milli." [...] Quik has some of Prince's little-guy arrogance, and here it's nearly schizoid: [...] "It's character, you miss it?/It's America, you visit?/Did you get on a boat without a ticket?" [...] Uh, yes? What? This makes him sound crazier than he actually is, though. Quik knows what he's doing. You can hear it on every track of this symphonic mini-masterpiece.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The extant {{presidential campaigns}} and {{elections}} literature has {{done much to}} point out the presence of frontloading across presidential nomination cycles, but has ultimately failed to sufficiently explain why it is that states have decided to move their primaries to earlier dates. Carman and Barker (2005) shifted the focus of the literature {{in the direction of the}} states themselves; looking at the influence of political culture on the decision to <b>frontload.</b> The focus here is on the states as well, with particular attention paid to the actual frontloading decision makers; the state legislatures, governors, state parties and secretaries of state. The decisions of these bodies or individuals from 1976 - 1996 to move their presidential nominating events to earlier dates or keep them in place are the basis for the dependent variable. The focus of the research then shifts to an analysis of the relationship between the decision to <b>frontload</b> and factors such as campaign spending, media coverage, voter turnout and type of delegate selection event. Ultimately, it is found that both the type of decision maker and mode of delegate selection used have a significant effect on a state's ability to move its nominating contest. 1 The frontloading of presidential nominating contests took on a decidedly chaotic tone fo...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} how research and development (R&D) collaboration takes place for complex new products in the automotive sector. The research aims to give guidelines to increase the effectiveness of such collaborations. Design/methodology/approach – The methodology used to investigate this issue was grounded theory. The empirical data were collected through a mixture of interviews and questionnaires. The resulting inducted conceptual models were subsequently validated in industrial workshops. Findings – The findings show that <b>frontloading</b> of the collaborative members was a major issue in managing successful R&D collaborations. Research limitations/implications – The limitation of this research is that it is only based in the German automotive industry. Practical implications – Practical implications have come out of this research.

40|$|How can the {{international}} community save more children’s lives faster and more effectively in the 21 st century? This Working Paper analyzes {{the extent to which}} “frontloading” and predictable vaccine funding, as proposed by the International Finance Facility for Immunization (IFFIm), is more effective in impacting vaccine coverage than spending vaccine funds equally throughout the lives of projects. The IFFIm is an initiative of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), and supported by the governments of the United Kingdom, France, Sweden, Italy, Spain and Norway. An initial IFFIm investment of $ 4 billion is expected to prevent 5 million child deaths by 2015, and more than 5 million future adult deaths. Using a stylized model, the authors quantify the positive and negative effects of predictable vaccine funds and <b>frontloading,</b> and finds IFFIm’s approach can increase the impact of vaccine coverage by 22 %. This is because stable and long-term financing allows vaccine manufacturers and countries to plan for long periods of time, knowing that resources will be available.

40|$|Quality Function Deployment (QFD) is {{a common}} model to <b>frontload</b> {{engineering}} design activities with, linking {{the characteristics of a}} product vs. the voice of the customer using linear relationships. This approximation is often claimed to be misleading when dealing with the design of complex engineering systems. The paper presents the results of experimental activities aimed at verifying usability and effectiveness of nonlinear functions as extension of the QFD logic. A total of 40 experiments was conducted in a given design episode, involving 139 participants, to analyse the trade-off between the benefit of introducing nonlinearity vs. effort and cost triggered by increased complexity in the modelling. The results show that nonlinear functions, while improving the granularity of the QFD mapping, keeps the method simple enough to work as ‘boundary object’ in cross-functional design teams, irrespectively from the experience of design team members. The experiments also highlight how users’ cognitive attention in the task is dependent from the format by which nonlinear merit functions are presented.

40|$|In {{vehicle and}} machine industry, {{there is an}} ever {{increasing}} demand for stricter requirements with respect to performance, energy and cost efficiency etc. Moreover, due to the competitive nature of the market, these specifications need to be fulfilled within a limited time frame to keep the time-to-market as short as possible. This {{has led to a}} general trend towards reducing the amount of resources during the design process as well as during the operational lifetime. The traditional approach of experiment based redesign is both expensive and time-consuming hence cannot satisfy these developments. Therefore, model based design and efficient prototype testing and validation is an approach that is gaining more and more entry {{in the state of the}} use.
