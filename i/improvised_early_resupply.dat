As such, they were often <b>improvised</b> from <b>earlier</b> defences. Medieval curtain walls were torn down, and a ditch was dug in front of them. The earth used from the excavation was piled behind the walls to create a solid structure. While purpose-built fortifications would often have a brick fascia because of the material's ability to absorb the shock of artillery fire, many improvised defences cut costs by leaving this stage out and instead opting for more earth. Improvisation could also consist of lowering medieval round towers and infilling them with earth to strengthen the structures.|$|R

40|$|SummarySteroid hormones are {{systemic}} signaling {{molecules that}} regulate juvenile-adult transitions in both insects and mammals. In insects, pulses of the steroid hormone 20 -hydroxyecdysone (20 E) are generated by increased biosynthesis followed by inactivation/clearance. Although mechanisms that control 20 E synthesis have received considerable recent attention, the physiological significance of 20 E inactivation remains largely unknown. We {{show that the}} cytochrome P 450 Cyp 18 a 1 lowers 20 E titer during the Drosophila prepupal to pupal transition. Furthermore, this reduction of 20 E levels is a prerequisite to induce βFTZ-F 1, {{a key factor in}} the genetic hierarchy that controls <b>early</b> metamorphosis. <b>Resupplying</b> βFTZ-F 1 rescues Cyp 18 a 1 -deficient prepupae. Because Cyp 18 a 1 is 20 E-inducible, it appears that the increased production of steroid is responsible for its eventual decline, thereby generating the regulatory pulse required for proper temporal progression of metamorphosis. The coupling of hormone clearance to βFTZ-F 1 expression suggests a general mechanism by which transient signaling drives unidirectional progression through a multistep process...|$|R

During the battle of Cuzco Wells, Marines using the M1895 Lee effectively engaged concentrations of Spanish troops at ranges up to 1,200 yards, using volley fire against groups of enemy soldiers while their officers called out the range settings. Though some problems were noted with the new rifle, the flat ballistics, accuracy and rate of fire of the M1895 and the light weight of its 6mm ammunition proved to be of considerable benefit during offensive infantry operations over mountainous and jungled terrain against both Spanish regulars and loyalist guerrilla forces. The extra cartridges proved useful when <b>early</b> ammunition <b>resupply</b> from Navy ships was disrupted {{at the outset of}} the Guantanamo operation, allowing Marines to continue their assault even while individually resupplying Cuban rebels who had run short of ammunition.

The result was a series of ambitious, album-length compositions designed to give all the players in the band maximum opportunity for expression while still preserving a rigorous sense of form: Zurich Concerts, Harmos, Double Trouble (originally written for an encounter with Alexander von Schlippenbach's Globe Unity Orchestra, though the eventual CD was just for the LJCO), Theoria (a concerto for guest pianist Irène Schweizer), Three Pieces, and Double Trouble Two. The group's activities subsided in the mid-1990s, but it was never formally disbanded, and reconvened in 2008 for a one-off concert in Switzerland. In the mid-1990s Guy also created a second, smaller ensemble, the Barry Guy New Orchestra.|$|R

The Confederates returned to their positions on Seminary Ridge and prepared to receive a counterattack. When the Union attack had not occurred by the evening of July 4, Lee realized that he could accomplish nothing more in his Gettysburg Campaign and that he had to return his battered army to Virginia. His ability to supply his army by living off the Pennsylvania countryside was now significantly reduced and the Union could easily bring up additional reinforcements as time passed, whereas he could not. Brig. Gen. William N.

He said he acted in response to concerns by agency employees who were uneasy [...] "about various aspects of this program", who [...] "had the feeling that what the agency was doing was fundamentally inconsistent with past US government policy and American values" [...] and because [...] "a critical legal opinion was missing". A 12-man team worked for over a year, interviewed more than 100 persons, visited all black sites, watched every minute of any existing videotape and reviewed more than 38,000 documents.

A dozen surplus C-46's were {{purchased}} in the US covertly for use in Israel's 1948 war for independence and flown to Czechoslovakia in a circuitous route along South America and then across to Africa. [...] The type's long range proved invaluable flying cargo, including desperately needed dismantled S-199 fighters from Czechoslovakia {{as well as other}} weapons and military supplies. On the return flight the C-46's would dump bombs out the cargo door on various targets at night, including Gaza, El Arish, Majdal, and Faluja (Both Egypt and Israel would also use C-47's as bombers and transports locally). [...] C-46's served both Korea and Vietnam for various USAF operations, including resupply missions, paratroop drops, and clandestine agent transportation. The C-46 was not officially retired from service with the U.S. Air Force until 1968. The type also served under a U.S. civilian agency, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The C-46 played a supporting role in many clandestine operations during the late 1940s and <b>early</b> 1950s, including <b>resupply</b> efforts to Chiang Kai-Shek's troops battling Mao's Communists in China as well as flying cargoes of military and medical supplies to French forces via Gialam Airfield in Hanoi and other bases in French Indochina.

5000|$|In 2013 Eskelin {{released}} a new recorded project for clean feed records entitled Mirage, improvisations with Susan Alcorn (pedal steel guitar) and Michael Formanek (double bass). Eskelin remarked {{that he was}} interested in exploring the [...] "expressive range of the saxophone that is perhaps most associated with its beginnings" [...] and that his objective is to [...] "bring that type of lyricism to the language of contemporary improvised music." [...] Continuing with this idea, in the liner notes to his 2015 release Solo Live at Snugs on hatOLOGY records, Eskelin discusses a revamped approach to solo saxophone performance, updating his 1992 release Premonition - Solo Tenor Saxophone in which he compares the two projects by saying “As opposed to reimagining my instrument I’m very much interested in the essence of a saxophone as being just what it is, a saxophone.” Going even further, Eskelin was interviewed by the web based music journal “Point of Departure” in 2016 [...] in which he conveyed his increasing advocacy of acoustic (non-amplified) performance in humanistic, if not spiritual terms. One such project that adheres to this aesthetic was released on the Swiss Intakt label in 2017, titled “Sensations of Tone” with bassist Christian Weber (from Zürich) and Michael Griener on drums (based in Berlin). This trio alternates freely <b>improvised</b> music with <b>early</b> jazz classics by composers such as Jelly Roll Morton and Fats Waller.

40|$|The London Musicians’ Collective (LMC) {{was founded}} in the mid- 1970 s by {{a small group of}} {{experimental}} and improvising musicians who wanted to create improved working conditions for themselves. The first LMC newsletter was printed in the late summer of 1976. At that time the organisation had no premises out of which to operate and no resources other than the energy and motivation of its members. Once premises had been established as office headquarters and concert venue in Gloucester Avenue, Camden Town, the policy of open membership and collective organisation attracted a very broad cross-section of musicians, live arts practitioners, instrument inventors, sound poets and sonic artists, many of them searching for radical new directions in performance practice and a means of bypassing the commercial criteria of the music business. Without the LMC, British audiences would not {{have had the opportunity to}} hear live work by many leading international musicians, and audio culture in the UK would not be so firmly established. Resonance FM, for example, grew out of the LMC in 2002 as an initiative guided by Ed Baxter and has since developed a reputation as one of the most adventurous art and community radio stations in the world. However, since the termination of Arts Council England support in March 2008, LMC activities have been curtailed and archive materials have been moved to the safekeeping of CRISAP at London College of Communication. Whatever may happen to the LMC in the future, an era has completed its cycle. In a positive sense, this opens up an opportunity to examine these LMC archives, both in terms of what they may reveal about the history of the LMC and audio culture in the UK, and as dynamic materials to inform and stimulate the creative practice of contemporary sonic artists. LMC history is particularly richly textured, not only because it contains important evidence (audible, visual and textual) of <b>early</b> <b>improvised</b> music and sonic arts activity in the UK, but also because it intersects with other initiatives of self-determination, collective politics and critical art practice in the 1970 s, such as radical publishing, feminism, structural film, dance, performance art, and sonic ecology, along with organisations like Music for Socialism and the post-punk explosion of independent record companies and promoters. Initiated by Cathy Lane and Angus Carlyle, this exhibition reflects my own experience of the LMC as a founder member who resigned in the early 1980 s. Inevitably, this is weighted towards the period between 1976 and 1981 and draws from my personal archive as well as the CRISAP holdings...|$|R
40|$|L'auteur présente le modèle de {{recherche}} utilisé lors de l'étude sur la Confédération des syndicats nationaux et la société de consommation, expose les difficultés rencontrées lors de la réalisation de ce travail et insiste sur les principales indications que l'on peut en retirer et les hypothèses que l’on est en droit de formuler. THE RESEARCH MODELThe title "Unionism, Consumption and the Affluent Society" {{describes the}} intended {{scope of this}} research. Our first goal was to describe the problem, its background, the general shape of the question, the stages of its progress, and to try and go beyond the daily activities and official positions, to the broader but less immediately obvious concerns, which were significant in restating the position and ideology of the CNTU as a trade union confederation. The primary motive {{of this study was}} also to study the behavior of the union member as a consumer. In the course of the inquiry we had to revise our objectives and view the question from a broader base, {{to take into account the}} fact that the Confederation of National Trade Unions was only one of many organizations interested in this type of problem. Some of the groups, independent of the union movementper se include the Fédération des caisses d'économie du Québec, the Fédération des magasins CO-OP du Québec, and the Fédération des associations coopératives d'économie familiale. The first part of the study is a general introduction regarding the objectives, actions and relations of the CNTU with the other cooperative groups in the field of consumption. The second part is devoted to a study. of the scope of the CNTU initial experience as such, i. e. the activity of its Family Finance Service (Service du Budget Familial) which does provide assistance to members in debt, directs the education of the union member as a consumer, and provides the training of CNTU officials. The third part discusses the relations, objectives, attitudes, and activities of the CNTU and its adjunct cooperative organizations. The behavior of the union members as consumers has not been studiedper se. Our initial hope to obtain a large amount of precise information for this study was partially satisfied. The only scientific and very interesting work available on this topic was M-A. Tremblay's and G. Fortin'sLes comportements économiques de la famille salariée du Québec 1. There was at that time no comprehensive study by a union on this subject in spite of the extensive work done by the CNTU in this general area. Our method was simple, descriptive, empirical and based on the available material complemented by a series of interviews. THE DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTEREDWe cannot say that we met with major difficulties in the conduct of our research. Much of the documentation and the interviews were obtained with the collaboration of the director of the Family Finance Service of the CNTU. However, two slight difficulties must be noted:a) The material provided by the union was incomplete, lacked precision, was un-dated and unsigned ;b) Other problems arose with the rapid expansion of activity in this field. In the time between the start of this study and the elaboration of the final report, the president of the CNTU among others made a series of statements relating to this problem. In addition, other « caisses d'économie », consumer cooperatives and other family cooperative associations were begun which could not be considered in this report. THE RESULTS OF THE RESEARCHInstead of a formal conclusion, we grouped the results of our research around three main themes :a) The emergence of an awareness by wage-earners as consumers ;b) The extension in the field of union interest and activity ;c) The necessity of enlarging the field of research in industrial relations. The Emergence of An Awareness by Wage-Earners As Consumers 1. -In the first place, the actions taken by the CNTU in the field of consumption were not a planned part of union policy, but a specific response to the needs of union members as consumers. In other words, this experience is not the result of an initiative taken by the CNTU but the consequence of an awareness by the union members as consumers. This new awareness was tied to actual situations and distress : indebtedness and its consequences to the daily family life, the threat of seizure of their possessions, and the fear of judicial procedures. 2. - It shall be noted that this awareness is not the expression of an intellectual or ideological development. It does not lead spontaneously to the reevaluation of this affluent society into which each and every wage-earner, unionized or not, seems to be integrated by sharing its value system which, in f act, influences his needs as a consumer. There seems however to be a certain continuity between the improvement of the wage level and working conditions asked for at the bargaining table on the one hand, and, on the other hand, rising expectations to consume more and more in accordance with economic growth and development. The motives for union demand and personal indebtment are often identical : a certain number of goods not necessarily usefulper se but important to possess in this "keep up with the Jones" society. The CNTU's and the ACEF's effort of education does not contest this continuity. They do not ask their students to give up their hopes in the field of consumption but they propose means of reaching these goals at the lowest cost possible for each and every individual insolved in the experience by balancing the family budget, by using credit unions, and by purchasing goods at cooperative stores. In addition to this, both organizations invite their members to distinguish between two levels of consumption, individual and collective, and propose to ex-tend the field of preoccupation regarding the latter to social security, health insurance and cooperative housing. The basic philosophy of all this movement presents an affluent society free of speculation and usury and where profit would not be a synonym of exploitation. 3. -This awareness has led the union member to turn spontaneously to the union organization to help him resolve his problems even if they are personal. The union becomes the organization one can "count on" and "have confidence in". This marked interest for the union in such a case is a spontaneous reaction and not the result of a serious tought bringing forward a precise definition of the union organization, its role and its functions. b) The Extension of The Field of Union Interest and ActivityThere is no doubt that the experience undertaken by the CNTU in the field of consumption constitutes a sign of an extension in the field of interest of this union organization. 1. -In other respects, the action of the CNTU seems to us relevant to a certain type of leadership and illustrates in a more general way, the evolution of the notion of union democracy. In order to respond to the expectations and needs of the union members in the field of consumption, in the absence of clearly defined "policy and orientation", the Executive of the CNTU <b>improvised,</b> not without <b>earlier</b> success, and hired a director for its Family Finance Service. In addition to his freedom of action with-in the organization this director will have to report to the executive board if not to the president alone. He will definitely influence the policy of this confederation in the area of consumption. These decisions and practices illustrate the evolution of the role of the union agents in labor organizations, their real influence and power and the evolution of union democracy. The CNTU is not unique in this area, but one finds this to differing degrees in other union organizations, as much in North America as in Europe. The power and influence of these agents seem considerable in the same proportion that their work touches a new field in which the elected union leaders coming from the rank and file are not particularly competent. This is but one particular aspect of a general trend to concentrate the position and power within the union organization in the hands of the administrative machinery. This movement cannot be explained only in terms of efficiency. To a certain extent, it is a reaction to the emergence of new problems located at a higher level and for which necessary solutions require a more global action by the labor movement at the political level and require the setting of agreement with other organizations. In these conditions, union democracy is less and less a democracy of direct participation where the union members themselves state the policy and orientations of their organizations, but more and more an indirect democracy where the members are called on by their elected representatives to approve or disapprove the policies and orientations decided by the executive and the technical advisers. This type of democracy is not without influence upon the behavior of the union agents ; they must administer and pay great attention to the desires and wishes expressed by the union members, often expressed in a confused manner. For certain permanent employees, paid by the union and aware of the influence they exercise on the definition of policies of the movement, the temptation is strong to solicit an electoral mandate ; but doing this they risk a confrontation with the leaders coming from the rank and file whose past experience is prestigeous in the eyes of the union members. 2. -The impact of the information and education effort undertaken by the Family Finance Service of the CNTU on the orientations of this central union is an-other important topic on which some comments are to be made. There is no doubt that the effort of information and education tends towards the realization of practical objectives. Immediate usefulness is one of the major preoccupations of the CNTU. But this leads to a certain number of fundamental investigations on the affluent society and the correctives this organization can offer it. We have underlined the evolution of themes and content of the information and education effort ; from an initial moralising like approach the CNTU progressively gets to a more economic and political stage. Exploitation of the consumer becomes the correlation of exploitation of the producer. To put an end to this exploitation,the CNTU advocates a growing intervention of the legislator 2, the formation of a vast cooperative sector where the decision making power shall be exercised by the workers themselves. It would be convenient to distinguish various levels of analysis : we stress the important role of the director of the Family Finance Service of the CNTU. Its ideas have been accepted by the executive congress, but in a less radical form, which would denote the existence of a certain gap between the preoccupations of the one responsible for the Family Finance Service and those of the directors of the CNTU. At the level of the rank and file, it is hard to gauge the interest aroused by these positions. A choice exists between two hypotheses : in the first case, they would above all be interested in the practical aspects of experience and their immediate benefits ; in the second case, they add to those practical propositions, a real desire to work for the realization of more profound social reforms. It is still too soon to contrast profitably these hypotheses. 3. - Beyond the specific experience undertaken by the CNTU in the field of consumption, it seems that this union organization has changed its orientation to advance towards a new multifunctional and renewed conception of union action. Strictly economic and professional union activities at the firm level would not be out of date but would be complemented by other actions undertaken this time on the political level in response to more general objectives : the upholding of purchasing power, development and economic growth, the reduction of unemployment, etc. This reevaluation of unionism is less the consequence of a voluntary and fundamental ideological reorientation than the consequence of the necessary adaptation of a society on the road to rapid socialization where the centres of decision making have shifted and the working of the system requires greater cooperation on all levels. The Necessity of Expanding the Field of Research in Industrial RelationsThe institutionalization of labor-management relations and the relative stability engendered may lead one to consider industrial relations as a closed system but this is an underestimation of society in a rapid evolution with dynamic consequences. The weak point of this study was not being able to express clearly the behavior, aspirations, and hopes of unionists. The unionist is simultaneously producer, consumer and citizen and it is here one must seek the explanation of the CNTU policy in the field of consumption. * It shall be noted that this research was directed by Mr. Bernard Solasse, assistant-professor, Department of Industrial Relations, Laval University. 1.
