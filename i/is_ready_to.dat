After the final moult, the genitalia and wings are fully developed, but a period of maturation is needed before the cricket <b>is</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> breed.|$|E

The child incapable of learning was rare. To Quintilian, ingenium represented a potential best realized in the social setting of school, and he argued against homeschooling. He also recognized the importance of play in child development, and disapproved of corporal punishment because it discouraged love of learning—in contrast to the practice in most Roman primary schools of routinely striking children with a cane (ferula) or birch rod for being slow or disruptive.|$|E
