5|$|Several further {{instances}} {{have been}} expounded by critics. Taum notes that Yah's <b>guilt</b> <b>over</b> her {{past as a}} prostitute leads her to the (unfounded) fear that Tono would leave her if their relationship were known; her guilt ultimately causes their separation, while Tono feels nostalgic for the past, in which he felt happier. Balfas notes that a factor driving Tono from Tini is the latter's former relationship with Hartono; due to her <b>guilt</b> <b>over</b> the affair, she is unable to express her love for the doctor. Siregar writes that such a theme is reflected in dialogue between Tono and Hartono, from which he suggests the novel derives its title. Balfas writes {{that there is no}} solution to the human problems presented in the novel.|$|E

5|$|As with A Wizard of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan is a bildungsroman or coming-of-age story, {{this time}} from the {{perspective}} of a female character, Tenar. Though she nominally has a position of high authority, Tenar feels trapped by her duties as priestess, and desires to escape to a place where she can make her own choices. In contrast to Ged, whose journey was chiefly a private quest, Tenar's choices have direct social consequences. While Ged's growth is traced through the various adventures he experiences in the first volume of the series, Tenar's development is shown through her exploration of her own domain. The labyrinth, in particular, with its twists and turns, is a metaphor for Tenar's exploration of her own thoughts. In this reading of the novel, the labyrinth symbolizes the imprisonment of the women, and the darkness and unacknowledged thoughts within Tenar, which she begins to struggle through after feeling <b>guilt</b> <b>over</b> killing the prisoners sent to her.|$|E

40|$|Recipients of {{intergroup}} apologies {{have been}} found to prefer expressions of shame <b>over</b> <b>guilt.</b> However, there is little research comparing the responses of a wronged group with those of a blamed group. Kenyans/Britons evaluated guilt/shame statements about colonialism, with blame measured as the assignment of collective guilt to Britain. Among Britons, there was a significant interaction, with high in group blamers expecting more reconciliation from shame than from guilt, and vice versa for low in group blamers. Among Kenyans, there was no main effect of blame, but more reconciliation was expected from shame than from guilt. Wronged groups thus appear to prefer shame <b>over</b> <b>guilt,</b> whereas preference for guilt/shame among members of a blamed group depends on the level of in-group blame...|$|R

5|$|In 1935, Tracy joined Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, at {{the time}} Hollywood's most prestigious studio. His career flourished {{with a series of}} hit films, and in 1937 and 1938 he won {{consecutive}} Oscars for Captains Courageous and Boys Town. By the 1940s, Tracy was one of the studio's top stars. In 1942, he appeared with Katharine Hepburn in Woman of the Year, beginning a popular partnership that produced nine movies over 25 years. Tracy left MGM in 1955, and continued to work regularly as a freelance star, despite an increasing weariness as he aged. His personal life was troubled, with a lifelong struggle against alcoholism and <b>guilt</b> <b>over</b> his son's deafness. Tracy became estranged from his wife in the 1930s, but never divorced, conducting a long-term relationship with Katharine Hepburn in private. Towards the end of his life, Tracy worked almost exclusively for director Stanley Kramer. It was for Kramer that he made his last film, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner in 1967, completed just 17 days before Tracy's death.|$|E
5|$|In ancient Athens, {{a person}} who {{committed}} suicide without {{the approval of the}} state was denied the honors of a normal burial. The person would be buried alone, {{on the outskirts of the}} city, without a headstone or marker. However, it was deemed to be an acceptable method to deal with military defeat. In Ancient Rome, while suicide was initially permitted, it was later deemed a crime against the state due to its economic costs. Aristotle condemned all forms of suicide while Plato was ambivalent. In Rome some reasons for suicide include volunteering death in a gladiator combat, <b>guilt</b> <b>over</b> murdering someone, to save the life of another, as a result of mourning, from shame from being raped, as an escape from intolerable situations like physical suffering, military defeat, or criminal pursuit.|$|E
5|$|Michael Dawson is {{a fictional}} {{character}} played by Harold Perrineau on the ABC television series Lost. Michael {{served as an}} antagonist of the second season. After losing a custody battle with Susan Lloyd (Tamara Taylor), Michael does not see his son Walt (Malcolm David Kelley) for almost ten years. They reunite when she dies, but on their journey home, their plane crashes on a mysterious island in the South Pacific. Here Walt is kidnapped by the Island's previous inhabitants, the Others, and Michael spends his time trying to retrieve him. He is eventually successful, and they leave the Island together, but the <b>guilt</b> <b>over</b> the murders he had to commit to achieve this leads him to an estrangement with his son and a suicide attempt. He returns to the Island on a freighter, but is killed when a bomb on it explodes. Michael reappears as a ghost, and apologizes to Hurley for killing Libby (Cynthia Watros).|$|E

50|$|Klein {{argued that}} people who never succeed in working through the {{depressive}} position in their childhood will, as a result, continue to struggle with this problem in adult life. For example: the cause that a person may maintain suffering from intense <b>guilt</b> feelings <b>over</b> {{the death of a}} loved one, may be found in the unworked- through depressive position. The guilt is there {{because of a lack of}} differentiation between phantasy and reality. It also functions as a defense mechanism to defend the self against unbearable feelings of sadness and sorrow, and the internal object of the loved one against the unbearable rage of the self, which, it is feared, could destroy the internal object forever.|$|R
5|$|Sandor Clegane, {{otherwise}} known as the Hound, is revealed to have survived his wounds, and is now living among {{a small band of}} villagers.

At a gathering, a trio of men from the Brotherhood Without Banners arrives and attempts to extort the villagers, but upon finding out that they have no worthwhile possessions, they leave. Sandor warns Ray that the Brotherhood will return, but Ray refuses to prepare for a confrontation with them. After Sandor goes out to the forest to gather some wood, he returns to find the villagers slaughtered and Ray hanged. Enraged, Sandor picks up an axe and marches off.|$|E
5|$|The character's backstory is {{explored}} {{throughout the}} sixth season of Desperate Housewives. Angela de Luca lived in New York City with her mother, Rose De Luca (Suzanne Costallos). At age eighteen, she {{dropped out of}} college, where she was enrolled as an engineering major, and joined a band of eco-terrorists, led by Patrick Logan (John Barrowman), with whom she became romantically involved. Patrick asked her to build a bomb {{that would be used}} against a corporate company. On November 10, 1991, the eco-terrorist group bombed a building that was supposedly empty; however, they unintentionally killed a man named Shawn. Angela sustained a large scar on her back {{as a result of the}} explosion. Consumed with <b>guilt</b> <b>over</b> having killed an innocent man, Angela agreed to run away with a private investigator (Jeffrey Nordling) who had been pursuing the terrorist group. Later, Angie discovered she was pregnant with Patrick's child. She and the private investigator raised Patrick's son as their own and moved several times, living under various aliases, in an attempt to evade both Patrick and the FBI.|$|E
5|$|An infant with {{a severe}} heart {{condition}} is admitted in neonatology, and is revealed to have been abandoned in a schoolyard by his biological mother, whose identity lies between four pre-adolescents. Montgomery quickly becomes emotionally involved in the case, reliving the feelings she went through after aborting the child conceived with Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane). Shepherd and O'Malley get quarantined after an outburst at the hospital, due to a patient suspected of having the plague. Their incapacity to leave the hospital leads to numerous confessions between the two, including Shepherd's reveal of his desire to divorce his wife and reconcile with Grey. Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) takes {{a leave of absence}} from the hospital, in a continuous attempt to bond with the grieving interns, who do not approve of her relationship with O'Malley.

At the conclusion of the episode, Stevens overcomes her grief and gets off the floor, which metaphorically expresses her desire to move on.|$|E

50|$|Changes in {{emotional}} states can also influence memory recall. Participants rated {{how they felt}} when they had first learned that O.J. Simpson had been acquitted of murder charges. They described their emotional reactions and confidence regarding the verdict one week, two months, and {{one year after the}} trial. Results indicated that participants' assessments for Simpson's <b>guilt</b> changed <b>over</b> time. The more that participants' opinion of the verdict had changed, the less stable were the participant's memories regarding their initial emotional reactions. When participants recalled their initial emotional reactions two months and a year later, past appraisals closely resembled current appraisals of emotion. People demonstrate sizable myside bias when discussing their opinions on controversial topics. Memory recall and construction of experiences undergo revision in relation to corresponding emotional states.|$|R
