How I will not tell you, my boy, but I went on a <b>fruit</b> <b>boat</b> from Havre to Southampton, and from there down to Thorpe. I saw the old man Stephen Hurd. It was on a Sunday night that I arrived, and I found him alone. He was as hard, Jean, as his letters. When I pressed him he ordered {{me out of the}} house. I would not go. I said that I would see my daughter-in-law. I would remain until I saw her, I said, even if I slept under a hedge. Again he ordered me out of the house. I was firm; I refused. Then he struck me, there was a quarrel, and he fell. I thought at first that he was unconscious, but when I {{examined}} him--he was dead." ...|$|E
6000|$|The line of <b>fruit</b> <b>boats</b> {{that ran}} from Hawaii to San Francisco was {{declared}} {{to be the}} property of Goliah. This was a surmise, for no other owner could be discovered, and the agents who handled the shipments of the <b>fruit</b> <b>boats</b> were only agents. Since no one else owned the <b>fruit</b> <b>boats,</b> then Goliah must own them. The point of which is: that it leaked out that the major portion of the world's supply in these precious compounds was brought to San Francisco by those very <b>fruit</b> <b>boats.</b> That the whole chain of surmise was correct was proved in later years when Goliah's slaves were liberated and honourably pensioned by the international government of the world. It {{was at that time}} that the seal of secrecy was lifted from the lips of his agents and higher emissaries, and those that chose revealed much of the mystery of Goliah's organization and methods. His destroying angels, however, remained for ever dumb. Who the men were who went forth to the high places and killed at his bidding will be unknown to the end of time--for kill they did, by means of that very subtle and then-mysterious force that Goliah had discovered and named [...] "Energon." ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to her legal practice, Elizabeth Eaglesfield captained a steamship named the Golden Girl which was completed in 1909 for a cost of $10,000. The Golden Girl could carry up to ten thousand cases of fruit from Benton Harbor to various ports around the Great Lakes. [...] Eaglesfield's legal expertise served her well on the Great Lakes, exemplified by winning a 1911 dispute with Milwaukee, Wisconsin, police who challenged her right to sell produce from the harbor. Her career as a captain continued until her retirement in 1930, leaving behind a fleet of five <b>fruit</b> <b>boats</b> that her son continued to operate.|$|R

5000|$|Another {{historical}} landmark is {{the cottage}} Rockend, where the poet Banjo Paterson {{lived in the}} 1870s and 1880s. It was built circa 1850 and is still preserved {{and open to the}} public in Banjo Paterson Park, Punt Road. It is listed on the Register of the National Estate. The site joins the Bedlam Bay walk, where remnants of the Great North Road exists and the walls of the Bedlam Bay Ferry. Banjo Paterson lived in the sandstone house (now a restaurant) whilst attending Sydney Grammar School. The house was owned by his Grandmother and was frequented by many artists and writers. Banjo Paterson recalled in his radio interview in 1935 the river had declined and was now lined with factories. However he could still remember when;"the wood-boat and the <b>fruit</b> <b>boats,</b> something like 7 ton yachts in size and capacity, would hoist mainsail and jib in the early morning, and come howling down the river with the westerly wind behind them, hoping to get far enough down to meet the north-easter before the wind failed. If the wind died away and they were left in the doldrums - well, they didn’t worry. They anchored and caught themselves feeds of fish which they cooked on their little galley fires, the scent of frying re-bream mixing not unhappily with the aroma of guavas, grapes, and the big hautboy strawberries which now seem to have gone out of fashion. Then, when the tide turned, they would up with the anchor and drift down till they opened up to the harbour where there was always some sort of breeze. They would strike Sydney some time or other, and would deliver their cargo into horse-drawn carts and then point the boat’s nose up river again, back to the gardens and the spitting of fire wood with wedges and American axes." ...|$|R

50|$|His travel {{experiences}} find graphical {{expression in}} his travel diary (Germanic National Museum in Nuremberg) and his watercolour paintings: picturesque places, mountains, coastal landscapes, harbours with <b>boats,</b> <b>fruits</b> and flowers, but scarcely humans. His pictures {{are influenced by}} his search for motifs typical of a country and they very often express his desire for colour and harmony. Particularly in his watercolour paintings Bredow increasingly discovered colour {{as a means to}} form his works, which are characterised by a combination of increased spontaneity and a rush of colour especially during his mature period. They show the tension between bright almost glowing colours and scarcly outlined forms. In his coloured chalk drawings and oil paintings Bredow explores abstracting representationalism, which is reminiscent of Werner Gilles’ geometrical use of forms and Ernst Wilhelm Nay’s abstract expressionism.|$|R
40|$|This {{recording}} and transcript {{form part of}} a collection of oral history interviews conducted by the Vietnamese American Heritage Foundation and donated to the Chao Center for Asian Studies at Rice University. This collection includes video recordings of interviews with Vietnamese Americans native to or living in Texas. This interview forms part of the national 500 Oral Histories Project conducted by the Vietnamese American Heritage Foundation. Nguyễn Tấn Trí was born in Châu Đóc in 1945. For generations, his family has lived in Chau Doc, so he, too, {{spent most of his life}} here. He attended law school in Saigon and went on to be a teacher at a middle school and a principal at a high school in Chau Doc. Tri received his law degree and began practicing law in Saigon in 1972. He was not personally involved in the war, however, his three brothers were all drafted so he became the only son in the family left, which disqualifies him for future military drafts. Tri has 6 siblings [...] 3 brothers and 3 sisters. Tri recalls the simple and peaceful lifestyle in Chau Doc. There was a very strong anti-communist sentiment in the area, making it difficult for communist presence. Most people, like his family, made their living in Chau Doc from farming. Tri married in 1968 and had 4 children; 1 passed away very early In 1975 with the Fall of Saigon, Tri was in Chau Doc. Because Tri was a professor and an active member in anti-communist activity (he had been actively involved in politics since his twentys), he was arrested by the Viet Cong on political violation grounds. When Tri was released, he immediately took his family into Saigon to live with relatives. Chau Doc was unstable at this time; anyone could be imprisoned at any time. Tri and his family left Vietnam in March of 1978. In the 3 years that they lived under the rule of Viet Cong, Tri taught and his wife took on small jobs to pass time until they were able to vuot bien. Tri says he had to leave Vietnam; he could not stand to live under the oppression of Viet Cong and the lifestyle they forced onto the people. Tri and his family took a bus from Saigon to Ca Mau, and from Ca Mau, they took a very small boat called a "ghe" to Malaysia. In the weeks before their expedition, Tri had to pretend to be a market seller selling <b>fruits</b> on the <b>boat</b> to explore the port and the water. Thirty to fourty hours after departing Ca Mau, the family arrived at a Malaysian refugee camp. They remained at the camp for 3 months before leaving for the United States. Tri was easily allowed to go to the US because before 1975, Tri had already received official permission to immigrate to the US. After his arrival to the United States, Tri and his family settled at Virginia where his brother-in-law lived and worked as a medical doctor. Tri's first job was a dish washer at a nearby restaurant. He admits that he was very poor but very content. Today, although he is still not wealthy, he is very happy with his life. Tri moved to Houston and opened his own convenience store. In 1993, Tri returned to Vietnam to form a political party as attempt to reform the government. He was promptly arrested by Viet Cong forces and charged with intent to overhtrow the government. Tri was released in 1995 after the United States interfered on his behalf. Tri has since been banned from entering Vietnam and has not been able to visit. When asked about his opinion about the US involvement in the Vietnam War, Tri responds that he does not believe the US was truly helping Vietnam. Though he is sincerely grateful for everything the US had tried to do for Vietnam, he believe that if the US had supported Vietnam differently, especially by providing enough supplies and ammunition to match those of North Vietnam, South Vietnam would have easily won. He admits that South Vietnam needed the US' help; he just wished the US had helped differently. He thought that the US presence in Vietnam changed the culture of the Vietnamese people; it became ingenuine. Today, Tri serves as vice president of a political organization campaigning for freedom and democracy for Vietnam. However, he is disappointed in the lack of unity among the overseas Vietnamese communities and wants this to change if we have any hope in overthrowing the Viet Cong government. He wants to encourage young generations of Vietnamese people to continue fighting for freedom and democracy for Vietnam and to not give up in their mission...|$|R
