Periodontal disease occurs in smokers more frequently as opposed to non-smokers. Typically, smokers have lower level of gingival inflammation, more excessive and accelerated loss of alveolar bone and epithelial insertion, deeper periodontal pockets and numerous gingival recessions. Along with that, smokers are carrying a decreased immune response that is expressed through various defense mechanisms. Smoking has negative impact on the outcome of conservative and surgical periodontal therapy. Effects of smoking on periodontal therapy success rate are requiring administration of antiseptic solutions and antibiotics throughout the treatment course.

40|$|Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are {{the most}} {{deleterious}} DNA lesions, which, if left unrepaired, may have severe consequences for cell survival, as they lead to chromosome aberrations, genomic instability, or cell death. Various physical, chemical, and biological factors are involved in DSB induction. Cells respond to DNA damage by activating the so-called DNA damage response (DDR), a complex molecular mechanism developed to detect and repair DNA damage. The formation of DSBs triggers activation of many factors, including phosphorylation of the histone variant H 2 AX, producing γH 2 AX. Phosphorylation of H 2 AX {{plays a key role}} in DDR and is required for the assembly of DNA repair proteins at the sites containing damaged chromatin as well as for activation of checkpoints proteins which arrest the cell cycle progression.

40|$|Industrial {{wastewater}} is {{a potential}} source of water pollution and a common threat to aquatic life. Chemical analysis of wastewater quantifies the concentrations of toxic substances but does not reflect their toxic effects on aquatic biota. Therefore, bioassessment is very necessary for monitoring of wastewaters quality. In the present study wastewater samples from Gadoon Amazai Industrial Estate (GAIE), Pakistan, were evaluated for their ecotoxicological effects using the automatic biotest ECOTOX and a Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM) fluorometer. Various physiological parameters of the freshwater flagellate Euglena gracilis like motility, swimming velocity, cell shape, gravitactic orientation and photosynthetic efficiency were used as end points. In addition, the water samples were analyzed for some common physicochemical properties. With some exceptions, most of the physicochemical properties of the tested samples were within the acceptable range of national environmental quality standards for municipal and industrial effluents (NEQS). However, all the water samples adversely affected different physiological parameters in Euglena gracilis. This study led {{to the conclusion that}} <b>different</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> present in wastewater, even at low concentrations, adversely affect the physiology of aquatic biota.

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{a review of}} the {{researches}} of Biomolecular Electronics Laboratory concerning the development of biosensors based on electrochemical transducers (amperometric and conductometric electrodes, potentiometric pH-sensitive field effect transistors) and different biorecognition molecules (enzymes, cells, antibodies), biomimics (molecularly imprinted polymers), as sensitive elements for direct analysis of substrates or inhibitory analysis of toxicants. Highly specific, sensitive, simple, fast and cheap detection of different substances renders them as promising tools for needs of health care, environmental control, biotechnology, agriculture and food industries. Diverse biosensor formats for direct determination of different analytes and inhibitory enzyme analysis of a number of toxins have been designed and developed. Improvement of their analytical characteristics may be achieved by using differential mode of measurement, negatively or positively charged additional semipermeable membranes, nanomaterials of different origin, genetically modified enzymes. These approaches have been aimed at increasing the sensitivity, selectivity and stability of the biosensors and extending their dynamic ranges. During the last 25 years more than 50 laboratory prototypes of biosensor systems based on mono- and multibiosensors for direct determination of a variety of metabolites and inhibitory analysis of <b>different</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> were created.

40|$|Objective: To explore factors {{influencing}} perceptions and viewpoints on {{the responsibility for}} the presence of <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> in food, on enforcement of laws and regulations that control human exposure to <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> in food, and on the effectiveness of such regulations. Methods: An online survey was completed by 740 individuals from several parts of Spain (median age, 47 years; 67 % were women; 70 % had completed university studies). Results: Over 87 % of respondents said that it was possible that throughout their lives they could have accumulated in their body <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> potentially dangerous to their health. The attribution of the responsibility for <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> in food to a larger number of social groups was more frequent among respondents who consulted information about the problem more often (odds ratio [OR]: 1. 92), who correctly identified factors that increase the likelihood of <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> in food being harmful to human health (OR: 2. 86), who better knew the health problems that may be caused by such substances (OR: 2. 48), and who recognised more food groups that tend to have concentrations of <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> potentially harmful to health (OR: 2. 92) (all p values < 0. 001).

Reports have shown that it contains <b>different</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>substances,</b> with lead being the most abundant. This study was therefore undertaken to ascertain the effect of two commonly available preparations of this chalk on some hematological parameters. Materials and Methods: Twenty-four adult female Wistar rats with average weight of 100 g were assigned into three groups (1, 2, 3). Group 1 served as the control and the animals received distilled water, while Groups 2 and 3 were treated by oral gavage with 40 mg/kg of non-salted (NSCC) and salted calabash chalk (SCC), respectively, for 14 days. Results: The hemoglobin (Hb) concentration and red blood cell (RBC) count were significantly (p< 0. 05, 0. 001 respectively) lower in the NSCC group, while erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was significantly (p< 0. 05) higher in the NSCC group compared to the control. There {{were no significant differences}} in packed cell volume (PCV), white blood cell (WBC) and platelet (Pl) counts compared to the control.

A total number of subjects was 120, 80 smokers males were affected with polycythemia and the remainders 40 males were healthy and served as a control group. The polycythemic patients were subdivided into two groups according to their ages (first group ranged between 30 - 40 years old and the second group ranged between 41 - 50 years old). PCV, clotting factor (FI, FVII and FVIII) were detected. The results of present study indicated that the levels of prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastine time (APTT) were significantly increased (p˂ 0. 05) in both groups of polycythemia in comparison with control group. Regarding concentration of fibrinogen factor (FI) and serum prothrombin conversion accelerator factor (FVII) were elevated (P˂ 0. 05) in both groups and pointed  out a positive correlation (r = 0. 437, r = 0. 378, respectively) with packed cell volume (PCV) when compared with those of control group.

The possible explanation to the changes mentioned above is {{based on the fact that}} confirm smoking is a dangerous material containing <b>different</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> that affect the vital organs of the body and induce abnormalities of hemostatic mechanis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The plant {{exposures}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} frequent poisonings reported to poison control centres. The diagnosis of intoxicated patients is usually based on the morphological analysis of ingested plant portions; this procedure requires experience in systematic botany, because the plant identification is based on few evident traits. The objective of this research is to test DNA barcoding approach as a new universal tool to identify toxic plants univocally and rapidly. Five DNA barcode regions were evaluated: three cpDNA sequences (trnH-psbA, rpoB and matK) and two nuclear regions (At 103 and sqd 1). The performance of these markers was evaluated in three plant groups: (1) a large collection of angiosperms containing <b>different</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>substances,</b> (2) congeneric species showing different degrees of toxicity and (3) congeneric edible and poisonous plants. Based on assessments of PCR, sequence quality and resolution power in species discrimination, we recommend the combination of plastidial and nuclear markers to identify toxic plants. Concerning plastidial markers, matK and trnH-psbA showed consistent genetic variability. However, in agreement with CBOL Plant Working Group, we selected matK as the best marker, because trnH-psbA showed some problems in sequences sizes and alignments. As a final and relevant observation, we also propose the combination of matKwith a nuclear marker such as At 103 to distinguish toxic hybrids form parental species. In conclusion, our data support the claim that DNA barcoding is a powerful tool for poisonous plant identifications...|$|E

40|$|In the seventies, {{the region}} known as Baixada Santista {{was a large}} {{repository}} of environmental contamination mainly resulting from industrial waste. In effect, the contaminated residues came from <b>different</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> including chemical, biochemical and others. Industrial waste was dumped or even stored in inadequate fragile ecological sites without any previous treatment and it resulted in significant amounts of air, soil and water pollution. A male specimen of U. cordatus presenting a malformation of the pollex (immovable finger) of its major claw (left) was captured in São Vicente city, raising concern to the local press and community. The immovable finger of the propodus segment in the claw of this specimen was modified into a structure {{in the form of}} a talon. This structure resembling an avian claw was comprised of five fixed ends united at the base. This might be a result from an injury of the original corpus structure while in a confrontation with another specimen. The newly found sample showed a high incidence of micronucleated cells in the haemolymph, approximately three times higher than normally reported. Perhaps this suggests the effect of an environmental influence in the morphology of the organism, most likely linked to the several sources of pollution in the region (public dump of Alemoa/Sambaiatuba, and the industrial conglomerate of Cubatão).
