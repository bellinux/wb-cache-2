50|$|Anthropologist Peter Schmidt {{discovered}} {{through the}} communication of oral tradition that the Haya in Tanzania have been <b>forging</b> <b>steel</b> for nearly 2000 years. This discovery was made accidentally while Schmidt was {{learning about the}} history of the Haya via their oral tradition. He was led to a tree which was said to rest on the spot of an ancestral furnace used to forge steel. When later tasked with the challenge of recreating the forges, a group of elders who at this time were the only ones to remember the practice, due to the disuse of the practice due in part to the abundance of steel flowing into the country from foreign sources. In spite of their lack of practice, the elders were able to create a furnace using mud and grass which when burnt provided the carbon needed to transform the iron into steel. Later investigation of the area yielded 13 other furnaces similar in design to the recreation set up by the elders. These furnaces were carbon dated and were found to be as old as 2000 years, whereas steel of this caliber did not appear in Europe until several centuries later.|$|E

These non heat-treated cold forging steels utilize the work hardening during cold working to ensure the mechanical properties. In other words, the required strength of forged part is achieved by work hardening with the accumulation of plastic strain during the cold working. Therefore, the plastic deformation characteristics should be carefully understood for successful process design. Evolution of both microstructure and plastic characteristics of micro-alloyed cold <b>forging</b> <b>steel</b> has been investigated in the present study. For the optimization of forging processes, finite element analysis and die life predictions were carried out...|$|E

It is estimated that the hardenability and temper stability of experimental steel were improved by tungsten alloyment and higher temperature temper was good for superior microstructure, proper strength and better toughness.
