50|$|The <b>eastern</b> <b>baton</b> <b>blue</b> is 20 to 26 mm in size. The male {{butterfly}} is pale dusky {{blue with}} a broad border while the female is brown. The butterfly is named for its prominent chequered fringe.|$|E
50|$|Pseudophilotes vicrama, the <b>eastern</b> <b>baton</b> <b>blue,</b> {{is a small}} {{butterfly}} found from Asia, east to Tian Shan {{and parts}} of China, west to the Balkans, Turkey, eastern Europe to southern Finland. It belongs to the lycaenids or blues family.|$|E
50|$|The Sinai <b>baton</b> <b>blue</b> has {{a highly}} {{localized}} distribution, {{mainly because of}} its dependence on Sinai thyme which occurs as discrete patches in the mountains. This butterfly is a poor flier, and individuals can not usually move more than 100 m. Thus the Sinai <b>baton</b> <b>blue</b> is a patchily distributed organism {{that is a very}} poor disperser between patches: it qualifies under the definition of a metapopulation.|$|R
50|$|Pseudophilotes abencerragus, {{the false}} <b>baton</b> <b>blue,</b> is a {{butterfly}} in the Lycaenidae family. It is {{found on the}} Iberian Peninsula and in North Africa, Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.|$|R
50|$|Pseudophilotes <b>baton,</b> the <b>baton</b> <b>blue,</b> is a {{butterfly}} of the Lycaenidae family. It {{is found in}} central and southern Europe and then east across the Palearctic to the Russian Far East.|$|R
50|$|Pseudophilotes sinaicus, the Sinai <b>baton</b> <b>blue,</b> {{one of the}} world's {{smallest}} butterflies, lives only on mountainside {{patches of}} wild thyme in an arid corner of the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt called Saint Katherine Protectorate.|$|R
50|$|In fact, {{the current}} levels of grazing with the current year-to-year {{variation}} in temperature are not a serious risk to the Sinai <b>baton</b> <b>blue.</b> Increased grazing pressure together with the expected rise in temperature over the coming years would be {{the main cause of}} the extinction of this small butterfly.|$|R
50|$|Sinai thyme {{is one of}} {{the plants}} suffers from over-collection. It is used as a {{medicinal}} plant by Bedouins and can also be sold in Cairo at a high price. Over-collection can result in the complete elimination of one patch or more of this plant. The loss of Sinai thyme patches adversely affects the persistence of the Sinai <b>baton</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly. It can lead to extinction of whole populations which {{may not be able to}} recolonized by other individuals from other populations.|$|R
50|$|Perkins won an open {{seat in the}} Louisiana House {{representing}} District 64 (the <b>eastern</b> <b>Baton</b> Rouge suburbs, including part of Livingston Parish) when he defeated Democrat Herman L. Milton of Baker 63% to 37% in {{the nonpartisan}} blanket primary held on October 21, 1995. He was elected on a conservative platform of strong families and limited government. Four years later, he was reelected without opposition. He retired from the legislature in 2004, fulfilling a promise to serve {{no more than two}} terms.|$|R
25|$|At {{one time}} Egypt had a cooler, wetter climate {{than it has}} today; ancient tomb {{paintings}} show giraffes, hippopotamuses, crocodiles and ostriches, and the petroglyphs at Silwa Bahari on the upper Nile, between Luxor and Aswan, show elephants, white rhinoceroses, gerenuk and more ostriches, a fauna akin to that of present-day East Africa. Nor does the country have many endemic species, these being limited to the Egyptian weasel, pallid gerbil, Mackilligin's gerbil (this may possibly extend into the Sudan), Flower's shrew, Nile Delta toad, and two butterflies, the Sinai <b>baton</b> <b>blue</b> and Satyrium jebelia.|$|R

40|$|Arid environments are resource-limited, with {{scarcity}} of water the key limiting factor for plants and their associated fauna. Consequentially bottom-up forces often control food webs, influencing the whole system through high levels of competition. The Sinai <b>Baton</b> <b>Blue</b> butterfly, Pseudophilotes sinaicus, is Critically Endangered, with a tiny endemic distribution in the St Katherine Protectorate, South Sinai, an arid environment. Its range is restricted to that of its sole host plant, the near-endemic endangered Sinai Thyme, Thymus decussatus, leaving the butterfly in a highly fragmented distribution. This study looks into the spatio-temporal variations in quality and abundance of the host plant {{and its implications for}} the Sinai <b>Baton</b> <b>Blue.</b> Over the past decade the butterfly has exhibited severe population cycles, with the causes still unclear; it could be due to the fluctuating resource levels with large temporal variation in the quality of thyme and density of inflorescences. The number of flowers significantly influences the larval distribution, indicating that resources {{play a key role in}} offspring survivorship. Population viability analysis has also highlighted the importance of management techniques aimed at increasing the butterfly's survivorship. The butterfly population sizes are positively correlated with the total resource area and the number of host plants but not the distance between habitat patches. Population viability analysis also suggests that habitat area is more influential than connectivity in this system driving current dynamics. Overall this project has highlighted the urgent need for conservation focused on improving plant quality within patches in order to save this fragile species...|$|R

50|$|The city of Saint Catherine {{and other}} close towns {{fall within the}} region of Saint Katherine Protectorate, which was {{established}} in 1988.It is a unique high altitude eco-system with many endemic and rare species, including the world's smallest butterfly (the Sinai <b>baton</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly), flocks of shy Nubian ibex, and hundreds of different plants of medicinal value. The region has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Area. Some of the species are endangered, {{but there are many}} wild animals, birds, flowers to see. There are many Sinai agamas, foxes, and rock hyraxes. Harmless for people, foxes regularly visit the town at night to steal and scavenge. Rock hyraxes are frequenting gardens, and there is a wide range of migrating and resident birds from Europe. Also, there is a large number of feral donkeys in the mountains who migrate to the region and lower lying areas (reportedly as far as El Tur) in the winter and go back to graze for the more plentiful summer. Many of them belong to families and are stamped with marks. However, they put a big pressure on the eco-system and there is a move to reduce their numbers by the Saint Katherine City Council.|$|R

40|$|Aims: Arid environments are {{resource}} limited, with {{scarcity of}} water the key limiting factor, but hyper-arid environments are rarely studied. We test for spatial and temporal variation in ecologically important characteristics to deduce plant adaptations to the extreme climate. Methods: The endangered Sinai Thyme (Thymus decussatus) exists {{as a set of}} patches on mountaintops within the St Katherine Protectorate, South Sinai, a hyper-arid environment with rare events of good rains (every 10 – 15 years). Important Findings: From spatial and temporal patterns of plant mortality, size, condition and flowering among 10 patches on the Mt Sinai massif, we deduce that the incidence and amount of flowering responds relatively quickly (1 – 2 years) to rainfall fluctuations, but plant growth respond only very slowly. Small individuals are most at risk of death during drought, and a high proportion of plants were dead at the end of 8 years of very low or no rainfall. No recruitment of seedlings was observed even in years of good rainfall. Droughts are expected to become increasingly frequent due to climate change; this may have important consequences for Sinai Thyme and also its associated herbivores, such as the Critically Endangered Sinai <b>Baton</b> <b>Blue</b> (Pseudophilotes sinaicus) whose larval stage feeds exclusively upon the flowers of this plant...|$|R
50|$|He {{moved back}} to Baton Rouge in the early 1980s and {{maintained}} a part-time music career, performing at Tabby Thomas’ Blues Box club. By the 1990s, Dotson was living in Houston, Texas, where he started his own band, Antique Funk. They became regular performers in Houston's blues scene, before ill health started to curb his output in the early 2000s. In August 1994, at its annual gala, the <b>Baton</b> Rouge <b>Blues</b> Foundation honored Dotson and Lightnin' Slim. Dotson {{suffered a heart attack}} in 1997, and a resulting stroke and complications from diabetes took their toll.

40|$|The {{movement}} of individuals among patches of suitable habitat {{is a key}} process in metapopulation biology, but {{is very difficult to}} observe under natural conditions. Thus, many estimates of rates of movement are indirect and incomplete, and there is little empirical knowledge of the factors affecting immigration and emigration. I studied intensively a local population of Sinai <b>Baton</b> <b>Blue</b> butterflies in a discrete habitat patch. The study lasted the entire adult flight period, and involved almost every individual in the local population. Using these data I attempted to estimate the number of immigrants and emigrants, and identified an important factor affecting inter-patch movement. Early in the season, individuals were resident in the study patch for only a very short time; I assumed this was because they were emigrating, and thus estimated that at least 14 % of the population emerging in the study patch emigrated. I assumed that butterflies not caught until they were relatively old, had immigrated to the patch (rather than being missed at a young age), and thus estimated that 13 % of the population caught in the patch was composed of immigrants, most of which were females. Individuals assumed to be immigrants arrived in the patch throughout the adult flight period, but older individuals generally arrived later in the season. Timing of migration was almost certainly linked to phenology of the butterfly’s only hostplant, Sinai Thyme. Most butterflies remained in their natal patch. The degree of inter-patch movement estimated using this method was consistent with other metapopulation studies, and would suffice for this species to exist as a metapopulation...|$|R
50|$|Batons {{were given}} to top commanders in most European armies from at least the Renaissance, as a revival of {{classical}} practice. They were typically presented by the monarch, and latterly were often elaborate pieces of metalwork, though earlier portraits show plain batons of wood, often longer and thinner than later examples. They were also typically carried by monarchs when portrayed in military dress. The French kings, and Napoleon, provided Marshals of France with ornate <b>batons,</b> typically of <b>blue</b> velvet with metal fleurs-de-lys before the French Revolution, then stars or Napoleonic bees.|$|R

5000|$|Dotson {{was born}} in Ethel, Louisiana, on October 19, 1933. He began his music career singing in local juke joints. As a {{teenager}} he relocated to New York, where he performed in comedy shows singing pop music standards, but his fledgling solo singing career failed to take off. By the mid-1950s he had returned to Louisiana, briefly playing in an ensemble with Lazy Lester. Silas Hogan had relocated to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, by the early 1950s and, equipped with a Fender electric guitar, formed the Rhythm Ramblers. Hogan sang and played rhythm guitar with Dotson (drums), Isaiah Chapman (lead guitar), and Sylvester Buckley (harmonica). They stayed together for almost ten years {{and contributed to the}} development of the <b>Baton</b> Rouge <b>blues</b> sound. Though Hogan was the group's leader, their first recordings had Dotson on lead vocals, and the tracks were released in his name. Two singles, [...] "I Wanna Know" [...] backed with [...] "Looking for My Baby" [...] and [...] "Oh Baby" [...] backed with [...] "I Need Your Love" [...] were issued in 1959 and 1960, by Zynn and Rocko Records, respectively, which were both owned by J.
