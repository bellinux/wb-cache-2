500|$|There was a {{negative}} fan {{reaction to the}} design of Enterprise, and criticism of the efforts of Drexler and the other designers. When questioned about this, Geoffrey Mandall stated in an interview, [...] "Having been around then, <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Doug Drexler and John Eaves did EXACTLY what the producers asked them to: Rick and Braga had very strong opinions, and knew exactly what they wanted." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 18, 2007, Arar spoke via video-link {{before the}} House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights and Oversight, and the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties {{at a hearing}} that is {{examining}} his case {{and the practice of}} rendition. In his statement to the committee, he detailed his experiences and expressed his hope that his case will not be repeated. [...] "I now understand how fragile our human rights and freedoms are, and how easily they can be taken from us by the very same governments and institutions that have sworn to protect us. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the only way I {{will ever be able to}} move on in my life and have a future is if I can find out why this happened to me, and help prevent it from happening to others." ...|$|E
2500|$|During a February 28, 2008 {{speech in}} Beaumont, Texas, Obama said, [...] "It's {{not good enough}} for you to say to your child, 'Do good in school,' and then when that child comes home, you got the TV set on, you got the radio on, you don't check their homework, there is not a book in the house, you've got the video game playing... So turn off the TV set, put the video game away. Buy a little desk or put that child by the kitchen table. Watch them do their homework. If they don't know how to do it, give them help. If you don't know how to do it, call the teacher. Make them go to bed at a {{reasonable}} time. Keep them off the streets. Give 'em some breakfast... <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> if folks letting our children drink eight sodas a day, which some parents do, or, you know, eat a bag of potato chips for lunch, or Popeyes for breakfast [...] You can't do that. Children have to have proper nutrition. That affects also how they study, how they learn in school." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Emmeline made me," [...] said Prissy, as {{if there}} couldn't be any appeal from that; and I knew there couldn't--for Prissy. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> if Stephen wanted to see Prissy again Emmeline must know nothing of it, and I told him so when he came down the next evening--to borrow a hoe, he said. It {{was a long way}} to come for a hoe.|$|R
50|$|Bushman {{said that}} he could not give way to writing a hagiography because <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> overly {{idealized}} Smith, I would lose credibility with non-Mormons. With a broad readership in mind, I could not conceal his flaws. Moreover, I tried to voice unbelieving readers’ likely reactions when Smith married additional wives or taught doctrines foreign to modern sensibilities. When he went beyond the pale, I acknowledged readers’ dismay.|$|R
40|$|As the Fall 1994 {{semester}} began, I {{caught a}} glimpse of a new student looking at the library 2 ̆ 7 s bookdrop with an expression of amusement and wonder. I 2 ̆ 7 d forgotten that a new set of people don 2 ̆ 7 t know how an ugly, out-of-date piece of equipment came to be painted to resemble an elephant. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> this was a place to begin to remember Sally Fry...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, I {{know how}} I talked. And <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> before {{the talk was}} {{finished}} you inquired how I stood as regards aristocracies, and my answer was calculated to relieve your fears." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; and <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> English gentlemen have {{associated}} {{with him as}} little as possible. I should call it a fatal thing to let Maura marry him. What does Captain Henderson say?" ...|$|E
60|$|We bound this beast {{with leather}} thongs of the punkah-rope, and tied its thumbs and big toes together, and gagged {{it with a}} shoe-horn, which makes a very {{efficient}} gag {{if you know how}} to arrange it. Then we carried it into the dining-room, and sent a man to Dumoise, the doctor, telling him to come over at once. After we had despatched the messenger and were drawing breath, Strickland said, 'It's no good. This isn't any doctor's work.' <b>I,</b> <b>also,</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> he spoke the truth.|$|R
5000|$|... so, I {{knew for}} Abe I wanted the food {{crisis and the}} plight of the third world {{completely}} exploited labour to be centre stage. But <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> in this universe ...I {{wanted to be able to}} say that later on we’re going to take a flight, say this far away, and we’ll land somewhere else and then we’ll focus on the animal testing victim, the ultra-last guy you would like to be, the lab-rat, who has nothing going on you <b>know,</b> so <b>that</b> was Munch’s Oddysee."

6000|$|... "I knew nothing," [...] he said, [...] "except this. They {{were neither}} of them young men of much stomach, and I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> {{the one who was}} the greater coward would {{probably}} try to anticipate the matter by attacking the other first if he could. I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> Fairfax was the greater coward--not that there was much to choose between them--and <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> he was the injured person. That is really all there is about it. My somewhat theatrical statement to you was based upon probability, and not upon any certain foreknowledge. As you see, it came off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I do know it," [...] {{returned}} Adams, sharply; [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> there's {{justice to}} be had in England. We've got a good case against the Captain, so we'd better wait till we get home rather than take the law into our own hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I live {{very much}} out of the world," [...] I said; [...] "and I don't possess the advantage, sir, of {{belonging}} to a club. But I happen to know the story to which you allude; and <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> a viler falsehood than that story never was told." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I do. But <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> he is {{no longer}} in a {{physical}} state to do it. No doubt he thinks that he is. A man of that type is sure to overvalue his own strength; but look at him, citizen Heron. Surely you must see that we have nothing to fear from him now." ...|$|E
5000|$|Teammate Mario Andretti {{clinched}} the championship at the race. [...] "It was so unfair {{to have a}} tragedy connected with probably {{what should have been}} the happiest day of my career", Andretti said, [...] "I couldn't celebrate, but <b>also,</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> trophy would be with me forever. And <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>also</b> <b>that</b> Ronnie would have been happy for me".|$|R
5000|$|Fraisse's {{creative}} use of film {{stock and}} lab processing helped achieve this atmosphere for the director. He suggested a special process using Kodak's Vision 500T 5279. He recalled, [...] "After rating the stock at 250 ASA, which overexposed it one stop, we then underdeveloped it, reducing the contrast and desaturating the colors. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> {{we were going to}} shoot in France during the winter, when it gets dark at 5 o'clock. I needed to be able to shoot as late as possible, so I made the decision to use the 500 ASA stock for the whole movie. ... Very often, I was shooting at almost full aperture—T2.3 or 2.5." ...|$|R
60|$|Although I {{knew the}} Chainbearer had his ancient Dutch prejudices against our Eastern brethren, <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> {{there was a}} good deal of truth in what he said. Frank Malbone, who was Rhode Island born, had the same notions, I found on inquiry; and I was {{disposed}} to defer to his opinions. Frank Malbone was a gentleman himself, and men of that class are always superior to low jealousies; but Frank must know better how to appreciate the feelings of those among whom he had been bred and born than I could possibly {{know how to do it}} myself. The project of the dinner was accordingly abandoned.|$|R

"I know it," [...] {{returned}} Omar impatiently, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> my enemy, Sidi Hassan, is {{more than}} usually on the alert just now; I think it well to delay for a time. Besides," [...] he added, smiling, [...] "you surely would not have me begin a revolution on the very eve of my marriage!" ...|$|E
60|$|I do not {{remember}} what the instructions were the President gave me, but I know that Governor Smith was not permitted {{to perform the duties}} of his office. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> if Mr. Lincoln had been spared, {{there would have been no}} efforts made to prevent any one from leaving the country who desired to do so. He would have been equally willing to permit the return of the same expatriated citizens after they had time to repent of their choice.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{mind the}} why," [...] {{continued}} the outlaw, with a pleasant look. [...] "You see that I {{know all about}} you--at least since you landed--and <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you have been several times in unseen danger, from which I have shielded you. Now, you have arrived at {{a part of the}} forest which is swarming with brigands, into whose hands you are sure to fall unless I am with you. I therefore come to offer myself as your guide. Will you have me?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Alternative press {{publisher}} V. Vale {{called the}} Units [...] "the first San Francisco band to perform using no guitars", [...] The Units {{were referred to}} as [...] "Punks playing keyboards" [...] {{in an article in}} the [...] "The San Francisco Examiner" [...] in 1979, and the Los Angeles music critic Kickboy Face of the fanzine Slash wrote of a Units performance, [...] "That night, watching the Units pound their machines into submission, I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> another cliched concept of mine was biting the dust once and for all. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> there probably was a future to rock n roll after all, and that future did not necessarily include anything resembling guitars." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thou seest,' I said, 'they {{have taken}} away the door. Is there aught {{with which we}} may fill the place? Speak quickly for they will be on us ere the daylight.' I spoke thus, because I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> we must hold this place or none, as there were no inner doors in the palace, the rooms being {{separated}} one from another by curtains. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> if we could by any means defend this doorway the murderers could get in nowhere else; for the palace is absolutely impregnable, that is, since the secret door by which Sorais had entered on that memorable night of attempted murder had, by Nyleptha's order, been closed up with masonry.|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless, I am {{thankful to}} say that my powers of {{judgment}} and of action did not forsake me. I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> it would be folly to attempt to follow my track back again through the intricacies of the forest in so dark a night, especially now that the track was partly mingled and confused with that which I had made in joining it. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> to give way to despair, and lie down without a fire or food, would be to seal my own doom. Only one course remained, and that was to keep constantly moving until the return of day should enable me to distinguish surrounding objects more clearly.|$|R
60|$|Nothing now {{remains to}} be pressed by me upon your Lordships' consideration, but the account given by the late Governor-General, Earl Cornwallis, {{of the state in}} which he found the country left by his predecessor, Mr. Hastings, the {{prisoner}} at your bar. But, patient as I know your Lordships to be, <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> your strength is not inexhaustible; and though what I have farther to add will not consume much of your Lordships' time, yet I conceive that there is a necessity for deferring it to another day.|$|E
6000|$|Bukawai sneered {{and rose}} to his feet. [...] "Very well," [...] he said, [...] "let him make his {{medicine}} {{and see if he}} can bring Ibeto's son back." [...] He took a few steps away from them, and then he turned angrily back. [...] "His medicine will not bring the child back--that I know, and <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> when you find him it will be too late for any medicine to bring him back, for he will be dead. This have I just found out, the ghost of my father's sister but now came to me and told me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] he said drily. [...] "I do not for {{one moment}} suspect you. The man was our spy upon your movements, but I am {{perfectly}} aware {{that there has been}} nothing worth reporting, and <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you would never run such a risk for the removal of so insignificant a person. No, my warning comes to you from a different point of view. It is, if you will pardon my saying so, none the less personal, but wholly friendly. The case of Duson will be sifted to the dregs, but unless I am greatly mistaken, and I do not see room for the possibility of a mistake, I know the truth already." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chris was classically {{trained on}} the violin and piano {{as a child and}} he began playing bass in London pop bands, turning down at one point the {{opportunity}} to play with Jimi Hendrix and Mitch Mitchell before Hendrix had struck fame. After several years, Thomas decided that he had little interest in making a career as a performing musician. In a 1998 interview, he stated [...] "I realized that being in a band you were dependent on all these other people, and <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> if I'd ever been successful in a band, I would've wanted to stay in the studio and just make the records; I wasn't that interested in playing live." ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{had known}} all along, however, {{that it would}} not be easy for anyone to capture Jimmy. If he saw them coming, he would take them with him. He wouldn't hesitate. Even before he went on the run, he would always say, 'Let's all go to hell together.' And he meant it. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> Jimmy wouldn't go to trial. He would rather plead out to a life {{sentence}} than put his family through the embarrassment of a trial. If he had a gun on him, he would go out in a blaze of glory rather than spend the rest of his life in jail. But I don't think they'll ever catch him.|$|R
60|$|As the {{circumstances}} of the murder, gradually unravelling, took stronger and stronger possession of the public mind, I kept them away from mine by knowing as little about them as was possible {{in the midst of the}} universal excitement. But I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> a verdict of Wilful Murder had been found against the suspected murderer, and that he had been committed to Newgate for trial. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> his trial had been postponed over one Sessions of the Central Criminal Court, on the ground of general prejudice and want of time for the preparation of the defence. I may further have known, but I believe I did not, when, or about when, the Sessions to which his trial stood postponed would come on.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! you may look," [...] {{observed}} the captain, replying to the gaze; [...] "but {{you may also}} mark my words, if you will. I've not sailed the ocean for thirty years for nothing. I've seen men in hot seas and in cold--on grog, and on tea--and I know that coffee and tea carry men through the hardest work better than grog. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> there's a set o' men in this world who look upon teetotalers as very soft chaps--old wives, in fact. Very good," [...] (here the captain waxed emphatic, and struck his fist on the table.) [...] "Now look here, young man, I'm an old wife, and my ship's manned by similar old ladies; so you won't suit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just what I say. If Van is a fool, I prefer simpletons to wiseacres. I {{know he is}} shy and awkward, {{and does}} absurd things now and then. But <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> he has the kindest heart that ever was; is unselfish, {{faithful}} and loving; that he took good care of his old parents till they died, and never thought of himself while they needed him. He loves me dearly; will wait for me a dozen years, if I say so, and work all his days to make me happy. He's a help and comfort to mother, a good friend to Toady, and I love and respect and am proud of him, though you do say he is a fool," [...] cried Polly heartily.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Tis {{far from}} me to despise you, or to do {{anything}} to your reproach. I know you are beloved of God for the sake of Christ, and that you stand fixed for ever by faith upon the same foundation with US. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the Lord doth put no difference betwixt male and female, as to the communications of his saving graces, but hath often made many of your sex eminent for piety; yea, there hath been of you, I speak now of ordinary Christians, that for holiness of life have outgone many of the brethren: Nor can their virtuous lives but be renown and glory to YOU, and conviction to those of US that have come behind you in faith and holiness. The love of women in spirituals, as well as naturals, ofttimes outgoes that of men.|$|E
5000|$|Villarroel had a poor {{opinion of}} his own {{knowledge}} of mathematics and science, {{a result of the}} low quality of education available in the Spain of his era. As he wrote: [...] "I knew well my ignorance and blindness as I went groping down the alleyways of my profession. But <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was {{in the land of the}} blind, for Spain lay in the grip of a darkness so fearsome that in no school, college or university in any one of its cities was there an individual capable of lighting a lamp whereby one might seek out the elements of these sciences. In the country of the blind the one-eyed man is king" [...] (quoted by Atkinson, page 24).|$|R
5000|$|... "Of course, {{our work}} is far from done. Yet {{considering}} current growth trends, I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> by the time I retire over 200 million households worldwide will have been benefited by the poverty vaccine of microfinance and/or village banking [...] What <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> is <b>that</b> my grandchildren will inherit a world where severe poverty has been abolished." ...|$|R
2500|$|One element Gerson Saines {{was sure}} about from the {{beginning}} was {{that she wanted to}} work with HBO, in part because of her longstanding relationship with the network through her work as an agent. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> by going that route, more people will see it," [...] she said. [...] "When you're trying to make a movie like this, it's very rare that it reaches a wide audience." [...] HBO was equally intrigued by the story, and Gerson Saines credits past and present HBO executives with keeping the project alive until it could be properly realized. [...] "I made a commitment to Temple that I {{was going to make it}} and make it right...I never pushed to get it made until now, because now we got it right." ...|$|R
