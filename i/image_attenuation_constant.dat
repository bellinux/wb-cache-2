40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method of {{improving}} {{the accuracy of the}} <b>attenuation</b> <b>constant</b> estimate obtained by using the crossspectral technique. In the cross-spectral technique, the envelope of the estimated impulse response is deformed due to the use of a time window. As a result, the estimated impulse response decays more rapidly than the real impulse response does, and the <b>attenuation</b> <b>constant</b> obtained by the estimated impulse response becomes larger than the real value.

The determination of <b>attenuation</b> <b>constant</b> should be enough to determine pressure and temperature profile of the well of interest. However, as reservoir pressure profile and flowrate are linked heavily to viscosity, this problem has to be solved in trial and error method, mostly due to the handling of viscosity change as a function of temperature.|$|R

30|$|We have {{presented}} {{measurements of the}} <b>attenuation</b> <b>constant</b> of commonly used, commercially available low-loss coaxial cables and rectangular waveguides down to millikelvin temperatures in a frequency range between 3.5 and 12.8 GHz. We have performed measurements of <b>attenuations</b> <b>constants</b> down to 0.005 dB/m using a resonant-cavity technique at cryogenic temperatures. In this method, we employ weak couplings to the waveguides resulting in resonant standing waves and measure their quality factors. We have extracted the loss tangent and relative permittivity of different dielectric materials by comparing our measurement results to existing loss models. The frequency dependence of the internal quality factors of the normal conducting waveguides are well described by the loss model, while the tested CC 085 NbTi and CC 085 Nb show small deviations from the predictions for the high-frequency dissipation in superconductors [39, 40].
