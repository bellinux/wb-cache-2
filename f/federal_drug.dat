HSI agents investigate drug trafficking organizations who import their products across the U.S. air, land and water borders, as well as their smuggling methods, which include the use of high-speed vessels, cargo containers, aircraft, commercial trucking, commercial vessel and human carriers.

25|$|A month later, he {{returned}} and asked Connolly {{if he was}} still interested in doing business. Connolly said yes, but {{that he would not be}} able to sell him any as he had gotten some bottles of P2P elsewhere and was busy making another batch. Three days later, Shapiro returned with a search warrant. Among other items, he seized two bottles of P2P, one an empty 500-g container, the other a partially full 100-g one (not the one he had originally given them). All three were arrested and charged with five separate violations of <b>federal</b> <b>drug</b> laws.|$|E
25|$|Defendant Angel Raich used {{homegrown}} medical marijuana, {{which was}} legal under California law but illegal under federal law. On August 15, 2002, Butte County Sheriff's Department officers and agents from the <b>federal</b> <b>Drug</b> Enforcement Administration destroyed {{all six of}} California resident Diane Monson's marijuana plants, facing light resistance. The marijuana plants were illegal Schedule I drugs under the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA), which is Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970. Monson and Raich sued, claiming that enforcing Federal law against them would violate the Commerce Clause, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Ninth Amendment, the Tenth Amendment, and the doctrine of medical necessity.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} years of the next decade, two {{prominent}} foreign citizens were perp-walked by American law enforcement agencies. Viktor Bout, a Russian long wanted by the U.S. and other governments for arms smuggling, was arrested in Thailand and taken past waiting media by <b>federal</b> <b>Drug</b> Enforcement Administration agents upon his extradition in 2010. The next year, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, then director of the International Monetary Fund and considered a leading candidate to challenge Nicolas Sarkozy in the 2012 French presidential election, was arrested and charged with the attempted rape of a hotel housekeeper. French journalists covering the incident in New York were stunned into silence when a handcuffed Strauss-Kahn was brought by them. In France, where it is illegal to publish pictures of an identifiable person in handcuffs or police custody unless they have been convicted, the images sparked considerable public outrage.|$|E
500|$|In 1973 President Richard Nixon's [...] "Reorganization Plan Number Two" [...] {{proposed}} {{the creation of}} a single federal agency to enforce <b>federal</b> <b>drug</b> laws and Congress accepted the proposal, as there was concern regarding the growing availability of drugs. As a result, on July 1, 1973, the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD) and the Office of Drug Abuse Law Enforcement (ODALE) merged to create the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). On December 1, 1975, the Supreme Court ruled that it was [...] "not cruel or unusual for Ohio to sentence someone to 20 years for having or selling cannabis".|$|E
500|$|Nunn {{also became}} an {{advocate}} of legalizing industrial hemp in Kentucky, writing, [...] "Frankly, I was opposed to the legalization of hemp for years because I had been of the opinion hemp was marijuana. I was short-sighted in my thinking, and I was wrong." [...] In 2000, Nunn secured an acquittal for actor Woody Harrelson, who came to Lee County, Kentucky, and planted hemp seeds in open defiance of Kentucky's law forbidding the cultivation of hemp. [...] Later, he traveled to South Dakota where, {{at the base of}} Mount Rushmore, he publicly presented an Oglala Lakota leader with bales of hemp after the tribe's crop was confiscated by officers from the <b>federal</b> <b>Drug</b> Enforcement Administration.|$|E

500|$|In November 2007, a California {{appeals court}} ruled that [...] "it is not {{the job of the}} local police to enforce the <b>federal</b> <b>drug</b> laws." [...] The U.S. Supreme Court denied an appeal by the city of Garden Grove in December 2008, {{upholding}} the decision. The case began in June 2005 with a medical marijuana patient from Garden Grove being pulled over by city police and cited for possession of marijuana, despite his immediate display of proper medical marijuana documentation. The charge against him was later dismissed, but the city refused to return his confiscated eight grams of marijuana, even after being instructed by Orange County Superior Court. The Supreme Court ruling affects 13 U.S. states with medical marijuana laws.|$|E
500|$|Internationally, {{the sale}} of gravity bongs is often {{prohibited}} in countries where marijuana is illegal due to its association with the herb. In the United States, under the <b>Federal</b> <b>Drug</b> Paraphernalia Statute, {{which is part of}} the Controlled Substances Act, it is illegal to sell, transport through the mail, transport across state lines, import, or export drug paraphernalia, meaning that the bong is illegal. Since Colorado, Oregon, and Washington have legalized recreational use of the herb, gravity bongs (along with other related paraphernalia) can be legally sold to anyone over the age of 21. In countries and states where use of cannabis is illegal, some retailers insist that bongs are intended for use with tobacco in an attempt to circumvent laws against selling drug paraphernalia. While technically the term [...] "bong" [...] does not mean a device used for smoking mainly marijuana, drug-related connotations have been formed with the word itself (partly due to punning with Sanskrit bhangah, meaning [...] "hemp"). Thus for fear of the law some head shops will not serve customers who use the word [...] "bong" [...] or [...] "bongs", typically insisting instead on the term [...] "water pipe".|$|E
