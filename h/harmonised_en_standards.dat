The amount of stain removal is then translated into a washing performance index.The spin-drying efficiency class is based on the remaining moisture content (RMC), which is the mass of water divided by the dry mass of cotton fabrics. It is based on a weighted average of full-load and partial-load cycles.|$|R

50|$|UL allows an {{individual}} {{composition of the}} door set from various components such as hinges, locks, frames, door leaves etc. as long as every single component has satisfied the UL standard and been tested individually as such. This is not true for the <b>EN</b> <b>standard.</b> Even though for each component there is a separate test standard available, which the single hardware component must satisfy, the <b>EN</b> <b>standard</b> allows only for the tested composition of components.

50|$|Available sieve {{sizes are}} usually {{regulated}} by standards. Those in common use are ISO 565:1990 and ISO 3310-1:2000 (international), EN 933-1(European) and ASTM E11:01 (US). <b>EN</b> <b>standards</b> {{are available with}} national 'badging' so appear as BS EN, FR EN, DE, etc.|$|R
50|$|Large {{differences}} exist in opening directions {{to be tested}} (EN requires both sides to be tested, UL one side only), permitted wall types (EN lists 3 types of walls, whereas UL does not differ at all), surface temperatures permitted (UL measures the first 30 minutes only, whereas EN the full duration of the test) and sustained flaming allowances (EN no flaming, UL several types and durations allowed). Another major difference is {{the treatment of the}} exchangeability of components such as locks, hinges, and frame types. The <b>EN</b> <b>standard</b> basically requires each combination to be tested as a whole, where as UL is satisfied with the single component being tested independently from the door assembly. Further the <b>EN</b> <b>standard</b> differs in its treatment of the extension of dimensions from the UL <b>standard.</b> <b>EN</b> allows for only limited dimensional extensions, but requires in such cases a surplus of test time and better gap values. Whereas the UL Standard does not allow an increase of the dimension of the tested door, you can decrease the dimension without any restriction. Last but not least, UL requires {{at the end of the}} fire exposure a hose stream test, where water from a hose is directed to the tested assembly. No water shall penetrate and the door shall withstand the impact. The <b>EN</b> <b>standard</b> does not mention anything similar.|$|R

50|$|Given {{that these}} {{different}} wall types are of different rigidities and perform differently in fire conditions, the <b>EN</b> <b>standard</b> {{requires that the}} certificate of fired doors indicates for what wall type it has been tested.

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{a selection of}} potential deployment and application scenarios for Cognitive Radio and Software Defined Radio. The chapter goes beyond a simple review of scenarios {{by focusing on the}} viewpoint of several key players in wireless communication research and applications: regulators, researchers from the engineering and economic/business community, industrial partners and companies, either directly or through their involvement in national and EU-funded European projects. In this framework, two key issues related to scenario definition are addressed: •	An analysis of players that determine the evolution of scenarios, including both technical and economic/business aspects; •	Study of approaches for classification of CR deployment scenarios, with the aim of identifying a set of elements that allow creating taxonomy capable of fit-ting existing and new scenarios relevant to CR and SDR. The chapter opens with an analysis of scenarios as proposed by ITU (Section 2. 1, authored by Mustonen and Matinmikko), followed by the vision of a wide set of EU projects on CR scenarios (Section 2. 2, by Matinmikko and Paavola). The im-pact of different regulatory and environmental conditions on application sce-narios is addressed in Section 2. 3, where Sridhar and Basaure provide a compari-son between feasible scenarios in India and Finland. Section 2. 4, by Mueck, Sri-kanteswara, Macdonald and El-Refaey, moves to the analysis of upcoming scenar-ios in Europe focusing on the concept of Licensed Shared Access as defined based on activities carried out in ETSI and CEPT. Next, the chapter moves to aspects related to planning and classification of scenar-ios. In section 2. 5 Medeisis and von der Emden propose a scenario plan-ning methodology aiming to support planning and classification of scenarios for Cogni-tive Radio and to help identify relevant business models. In Section 2. 6 Medeisis, Holland and De Nardis propose an approach to the definition of a taxonomy of CR application scenarios, aiming at fitting present and future applications in a coher-ent framework. Finally, Section 2. 7 by Cesar Gutierrez and Hamid Reza Karimi offers an example of very practical application scenario for deployment of White Space Devices in TV Bands as established by a <b>harmonised</b> European <b>standard</b> <b>EN</b> 301 598...|$|R

40|$|In this study, Douglas-Fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.)

All panels were tested for physical property (thickness swelling (TS), density (D)) and mechanical properties (bending strength (BS), internal bond (IB), and modulus of elasticity (MOE)). The effects of press temperature, press time and board density on the some properties of particleboards were investigated. The results were compared with <b>EN</b> <b>standard</b> values. Results showed that Douglas-Fir particleboards produced at 0. 70 g/cm 3 density had the requirements of IB and BS. The particleboards which have 0. 60 g/cm 3 board density, needed 150 °C press temperature, 7 min. press time, respectively. In these production conditions, the particleboards had the required level of IB and BS according to the <b>EN</b> <b>standards.</b> But, TS values were higher than the required levels of the standard. For this reason, additional work is needed to improve the thickness swelling of Douglas-Fir particleboards...|$|R
