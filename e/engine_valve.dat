5|$|Valve {{struggled}} to find a publisher, as many believed the game was too ambitious for a first-time developer. Sierra On-Line signed Valve for a one-game deal as it was interested in making a 3D action game, especially one based on the Quake <b>engine.</b> <b>Valve</b> first showed Half-Life in early 1997; it was a success at Electronic Entertainment Expo that year, where Valve demonstrated the game's animation and artificial intelligence.|$|E
5|$|The goal of Lost Coast was to {{demonstrate}} the new high-dynamic-range rendering implemented into the Source game <b>engine.</b> <b>Valve</b> first attempted to implement high-dynamic-range rendering in Source in late 2003. The first method stored textures in RGBA color space, allowing for multisample anti-aliasing and pixel shaders to be used, but this prevented alpha mapping and fog effects from working properly, as well as making textures appear sharp and jagged. The second method involved saving two versions of a texture: one with regular data, {{and the other with}} overbrightening data. However, this technique did not allow for multisample anti-aliasing and consumed twice as much video card memory, making it infeasible. The third method, shown at the E3 convention in 2005, used floating point data to define the RGB color space, allowing for reasonably efficient storage of the high-dynamic-range data. However, this method also did not allow for multisample anti-aliasing, and was only compatible with Nvidia video cards, leaving ATI cards unable to run high dynamic range. The fourth and final method compromised between the second and third methods, using overbrightening textures sparingly and allowing ATI cards to render HDR in a different way to the Nvidia ones while nearly producing the same end result.|$|E
5|$|To {{experience}} {{firsthand the}} processes mod-makers {{would have to}} go through with the new <b>engine,</b> <b>Valve</b> ported Half-Life (dubbed Half-Life: Source) and Counter-Strike to their new Source engine. Half-Life: Source is a straight port, lacking any new content or the Blue Shift High Definition pack. However, it does take advantage of vertex and pixel shaders for more realistic water effects, as well as Half-Life 2's realistic physics engine. They also added several other features from Half-Life 2, including improved dynamic lightmaps, vertex maps, ragdolls, and a shadowmap system with cleaner, higher resolution, specular texture and normal maps, as well as utilization of the render-to-texture soft shadows found in Half-Life 2s Source engine, along with 3D skybox replacements in place of the old 16-bit color prerendered bitmap skies. The Half-Life port possesses many of the Source engine's graphical strengths as well as control weaknesses that have been noted in the Source engine. Later updates added a field of view options, support for OS X and Linux, an optional high-definition texture pack, among other improvements. Half-Life: Source is available with special editions of Half-Life 2, or separately on Steam.|$|E

500|$|The {{tank was}} {{powered by a}} T-26 [...] flat row 4-cylinder {{air-cooled}} petrol engine, which was a complete Soviet copy of the Armstrong Siddeley engine used in the Vickers 6-Ton. The engine was located in the rear part of the hull. Early Soviet-made tank engines were of bad quality but they became better beginning in 1934. The T-26 (Armstrong Siddeley) engine {{did not have an}} over-speed limiter, which often resulted in overheating and <b>engine</b> <b>valve</b> breakage, especially in summer. A fuel tank for [...] and an oil box for [...] were placed alongside the engine. The engine required top-grade petrol; the use of second-rate petrol could cause damage to the valve units because of engine detonation. From mid-1932, a more capacious fuel tank (290 L instead of 182 L) and a simplified oil box were introduced. An engine cooling fan was mounted over the engine in a special shroud. From early 1932, the exhaust silencer was affixed by three clamps instead of two.|$|E
500|$|When Andy Schatz {{pitched the}} game to Microsoft Game Studios, it was turned down. Schatz responded saying [...] "they were crazy" [...] {{and asked if he}} could repitch the game; they agreed to let him do so. He {{continued}} to work on Monaco for roughly a year in order [...] "to make it something really marketable". When he pitched it to Microsoft Game Studios for the second time, it was turned down. After these events, Schatz got the impression that the game {{was not going to be}} released on the Xbox 360. [...] "That really bummed me out", Schatz said in an interview with Mike Rose from Gamasutra, [...] "because I felt like the Xbox was the ideal platform for this particular game, because of the prevalence of headsets, the marketplace being strong, and the Xbox being the easiest console to work with. And of course the game was written in XNA, so it was a no-brainer". [...] Empty Clip Studios was brought onto the project in order to port {{the game to}} the RapidFire engine, so that the game could be release on the PlayStation 3, but the port was never finished. In order to publish the game on Xbox Live, Schatz partnered with video game publishing company Majesco Entertainment. As a result, the game had to be ported from Empty Clip to the RapidFire <b>engine.</b> <b>Valve</b> Corporation approached Schatz and offered to get the game on the Steam store distribution platform.|$|E

40|$|In {{automobile}} engineering terminology a {{multi-valve engine}} {{is one where}} each cylinder has more than two <b>valves.</b> A multivalve <b>engine</b> has better breathing and can operate at higher revolutions per minute (rpm) than a two <b>valve</b> <b>engine,</b> delivering more power. Nowadays Eicher Motor is generating only two <b>valve</b> <b>engines.</b> But the need of the hour is to develop more efficient, four <b>valve</b> <b>engines,</b> which provide better fuel efficiency. Eicher Motor has started working on four <b>valve</b> <b>engines</b> because two <b>valve</b> <b>engines</b> apart from delivering inferior fuel efficiency compared to four <b>valve</b> <b>engines</b> also fall short {{on the front of}} emission norms compliance. To keep the transition two valve to four valve economical, it was proposed that instead of having an entirely new set up for assembling the four <b>valve</b> <b>engines,</b> two <b>valve</b> <b>engine</b> assembly line be use after required modification. For this change were made to engine assembly common line (Block), and cylinder head assembly line conveyors, location of cylinder head assembly line, manpower, machine and tools etc. of Eicher Motor as per the requirement of four valve and two valve assembly line and also engine assembly process was changed...|$|R
