Paradoxical as it sounds, the principles of the number field sieve, in a strict sense, could not be applied to number <b>field</b> <b>computations,</b> yet. In this article we give an indication of the obstructions.

40|$|<b>Field</b> <b>{{computation}}</b> (FC) may {{be defined}} informally as computation in which data is represented in fields, that is, as continua of continuously variable quantity.
