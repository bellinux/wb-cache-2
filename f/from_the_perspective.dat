5|$|Although {{a planet}} {{has yet to}} be {{directly}} observed around Vega, the presence of a planetary system can not yet be ruled out.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Medical {{confidentiality}} {{and maintenance of}} patient personal privacy are considered two important moral obligations in medical ethics {{with a long history}} in medicine. To be efficient, a healthcare system needs active participation of and appropriate cooperation between the recipients and providers of healthcare services. This study was conducted to investigate healthcare service recipients' perceptions regarding observance of patient privacy and medical confidentiality in teaching healthcare centers affiliated with the Qom University of Medical Sciences. Methods: In this cross-sectional (descriptive-analytical) study that was conducted in 2015 - 2016, 380 patients referred to teaching healthcare centers affiliated with the Qom University of Medical Sciences were enrolled according to randomized sampling. Data were gathered by a researcher-developed questionnaire according to Patient Rights Charter and analyzed by descriptive and nonparametric statistics test in SPSS 16. Results: Patient privacy and confidentiality were not observed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>perspectives</b> of 26. 3 % of them, partly observed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>perspectives</b> of 50 %, and fully observed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>perspectives</b> of 23. 7 %. Alongside observance of patient privacy, the most important item, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> healthcare service recipients' perspectives, was observance of client orientation, which was observed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>perspectives</b> of 24. 5 % of them, partly observed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>perspectives</b> of 50. 4 %, and not observed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>perspectives</b> of 25. 1 %. Conclusion: <b>From</b> half of <b>the</b> patients' <b>perspectives</b> in <b>the</b> healthcare centers affiliated with the Qom University of Medical Sciences, patient privacy and medical confidentiality were partly observed. Therefore, the authorities can take necessary steps to set priorities and appropriately plan for improving observance of the patient privacy and medical confidentiality as well as to respect the patients' territory and rights in all areas, especially nursing, administrative, educational, and research...|$|R

5|$|And the Mountains Echoed is {{the third}} novel by Afghan-American author Khaled Hosseini. Published in 2013 by Riverhead Books, it {{deviates}} from Hosseini's style {{in his first two}} works through his choice to avoid focusing on any one character. Rather, the book is written similarly to a collection of short stories, with each of the nine chapters being told <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>perspective</b> of a different character. The book's foundation is built on the relationship between ten-year-old Abdullah and his three-year-old sister Pari and their father's decision to sell her to a childless couple in Kabul, an event that ties the various narratives together.|$|E
5|$|Between 1769 and 1773, {{the young}} Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart {{and his father}} Leopold Mozart made three Italian journeys. The first, an {{extended}} tour of 15 months, was financed by performances for the nobility and by public concerts, and took in the most important Italian cities. The second and third journeys were to Milan, for Wolfgang to complete operas that had been commissioned there on the first visit. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>perspective</b> of Wolfgang's musical development the journeys were a considerable success, and his talents were recognised by honours which included a papal knighthood and memberships in leading philharmonic societies.|$|E
5|$|Carpentier was {{influenced}} {{by a number of}} authors. Jean Price Mars's Ainsi parla l'oncle (So Spoke the Uncle) presents two arguments that Carpentier applied to his historical approach: firstly, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>perspective</b> of a Haitian peasant, the Revolution did nothing more than replace leaders, since the exploitation continued; secondly, Price Mars assumes the authenticity of the belief in African gods, in contrast with a shallow Catholicism. William Seabrook's The Magic Island made connections between religion and history and was considered a beautiful book by Carpentier.|$|E
