5|$|Fausto's {{remnants}} passed {{north of}} the Hawaiian Islands uneventfully until they interacted with a tropical upper-tropospheric trough (TUTT) on August 30. In combination with warm waters, a tropical depression with some subtropical features developed. At {{this time it was}} located around latitude 30°N. By September 1, Fausto had redeveloped <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> but tropical ministorm. Its rebirth was brief, however, as a mid-latitude cyclone absorbed the system early on September 3.|$|E
5|$|By 1832, Honoré de Balzac {{had begun}} {{to make a name}} for himself as a writer. The second of five children, Balzac was sent to the Oratorian College de Vendôme at the age of eight. He {{returned}} from the school six years later, sickly and weak. He was taught by tutors and private schools for two and a half years, then attended the Sorbonne in Paris. After training as a law clerk for three years, he moved <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> garret in 1819 and began writing.|$|E
5|$|In 1830 Honoré de Balzac {{had only}} begun to achieve {{recognition}} as a writer. Although his parents had persuaded him to make his profession the law, he announced in 1819 {{that he wanted to}} become an author. His mother was distraught, but she and his father agreed to give him a small income, on the condition that he dedicate himself to writing, and deliver to them half of his gross income from any published work. After moving <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> room near the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal in Paris, Balzac wrote for one year, without success. Frustrated, he moved back to his family in the suburb of Villeparisis and borrowed money from his parents to pursue his literary ambitions further. He spent the next several years writing simple potboiler novels, which he published under a variety of pseudonyms. He shared some of his income from these with his parents, but by 1828 he still owed them 50,000 francs.|$|E

5|$|Sen discovers paper shikigami {{attacking a}} dragon and recognizes the dragon as Haku transformed. When a grievously-injured Haku crashes into Yubaba's penthouse, Sen follows him upstairs. When she reaches Haku, a shikigami that stowed away {{on her back}} {{transforms}} into Zeniba, Yubaba's twin sister. She transforms Yubaba's baby son Boh into a mouse, creates a decoy baby and turns Yubaba's bird creature <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> bird. Zeniba tells Sen that Haku has stolen a magic golden seal from her, and warns Sen that it carries a deadly curse. After Haku dives to the boiler room with Sen and Boh on his back, she feeds him part of the dumpling, causing him to vomit both the seal and a black slug, which Sen crushes with her foot.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen is {{composed}} of five somites, all of which lack appendages except the last. The back-facing margins of these somites bear small spines and four or more larger spines. The last abdominal somite forks {{into a pair of}} flattened spatulate appendages (the uropods) that function as a tail fan (caudal rami). In addition to stabilising the body while swimming, a quick flick of the tail fan can rapidly propel the animal backwards, which may have functioned as a means of escaping predators like in modern shrimp. Traces of four fused segments are evident in the three faint lines dividing each lobe of the tail fan. A long telson is present {{at the end of the}} body. Traces of a rounded stomach, small digestive glands, and an intestine that terminates <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> anal opening on the telson can also be observed in some specimens.|$|E

25|$|The {{restoration}} of Queiq River is directed towards {{the revival of}} the flow of the river, demolishing both the artificial cover of the stream bed and the reinforcement of the stream banks along the river in the city centre. The flow of the river was blocked during the 1960s by the Turks, turning the river <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> sewage channel, something that led the authorities to cover the stream during the 1970s. In 2006 the flow of pure water was restored through the efforts of the Syrian government, granting a new life to the Quweiq River.|$|E
25|$|A Coulter counter is an {{appliance}} {{that can}} count cells {{as well as}} measure their volume. It {{is based on the}} fact that cells show great electrical resistance; in other words, they conduct almost no electricity. In a Coulter counter the cells, swimming in a solution that conducts electricity, are sucked one by one <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> gap. Flanking the gap are two electrodes that conduct electricity. When no cell is in the gap, electricity flows unabated, but when a cell is sucked into the gap the current is resisted. The Coulter counter counts the number of such events and also measures the current (and hence the resistance), which directly correlates to the volume of the cell trapped. A similar system is the CASY cell counting technology.|$|E
500|$|Lost Coast was {{generally}} well received by video game critics. 1UP.com enjoyed {{the amount of}} detail, including the graphics, puzzles, and intelligent enemies, saying, [...] "Valve just packed more atmosphere <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> snippet than most shooters muster, period." [...] The review also praised the level's commentary system, calling it an informative addition, and enjoyed the interesting and insightful comments made by some of its creators.

500|$|Metroid Prime Hunters {{was given}} [...] "generally favorable" [...] reviews, {{according}} to Metacritic. Several reviews praised {{the amount of}} value that Metroid Prime Hunters offered on the Nintendo DS handheld video game console. GameZone considered the game phenomenal, and believed that it used the DS to its maximum potential regarding graphical ability and innovation. The Toronto Sun remarked that the graphics were big enough selling points on their own for the game, and The Press called Metroid Prime Hunters the best-looking game for the Nintendo DS. The Australian agreed that the graphics are [...] "outstanding" [...] and push the Nintendo DS to its limits, and The Independent asserted that Metroid Prime Hunters was perhaps the best first-person shooter ever for a handheld console. GamePros review stated that [...] "it's {{hard to imagine how}} Nintendo squeezed Hunters <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> DS cartridge." [...] Despite a few [...] "small quirks", the magazine noted that Hunters [...] "is a very polished game".

500|$|The {{story is}} set in [...] "20XX", 35 years after a nuclear apocalypse which devastates the world and {{permanently}} opens a portal to the demon world of Atziluth. Humanity is forced to survive in underground bunkers. Two such survivors, the protagonist and his friend, release a demon called Pazuzu from a video game. Pazuzu tells the two that they are destined messiahs who will save mankind. He grants the Hero the ability to summon and talk to demons, and his friend the gift of magic. Pazuzu gives them the mission of destroying the demon lords that have taken control of Tokyo, starting with Bael, the demon that sealed him inside Devil Busters. The heroes venture outside the shelter, and they are recognized as messiahs by the Church of Messiah. Upon reaching Tokyo Tower, however, the heroes find a witch who was also named a messiah by Pazuzu, but claims he has been manipulating them for his own gain. The friend refuses to believe that Pazuzu is using them. In order to progress in the story, the player has {{to side with the}} witch, causing the friend to leave and become his enemy. The Messiah and the witch travel around Tokyo and defeat the warring demon lords that attempt {{to take control of the}} city, disbanding the Cult of Deva in the process, and eventually kill Pazuzu himself. Meanwhile, the hero's friend frees Lucifer from the seal placed upon him in the previous game. Eventually, the heroes reach Bael, who kills the hero's friend as he attempts to fulfill Pazuzu's will. The hero avenges his friend, and when he defeats Bael the demon turns <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> frog: the player can choose to kill the frog or take it with them.|$|E

2500|$|The male cones have {{structures}} called microsporangia {{that produce}} yellowish pollen through meiosis. Pollen is released and {{carried by the}} wind to female cones.

2500|$|The first Marx Brothers/Thalberg {{film was}} A Night at the Opera (1935), a satire {{on the world}} of opera, where the {{brothers}} help two young singers in love by throwing a production of Il Trovatore into chaos. The film—including its famous scene where an absurd number of people crowd <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> stateroom on a ship—was a great success, and was followed two years later by an even bigger hit, A Day at the Races (1937), in which the brothers cause mayhem in a sanitarium and at a horse race. The film features Groucho and Chico's famous [...] "Tootsie Frootsie Ice Cream" [...] sketch. In a 1969 interview with Dick Cavett, Groucho said that the two movies made with Thalberg were the best that they ever produced. Despite the Thalberg films' success, the brothers left MGM in 1937; Thalberg had died suddenly on September 14, 1936, two weeks after filming began on A Day at the Races, leaving the Marxes without an advocate at the studio.|$|E
