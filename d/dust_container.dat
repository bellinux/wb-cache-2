40|$|This review {{describes}} {{our current}} understanding of interstellar extinction. This differ substantially from {{the ideas of}} the 20 th century. With infrared surveys of hundreds of millions of stars over the entire sky, such as 2 MASS, SPITZER-IRAC, and WISE, we have looked at the densest and most rarefied regions of the interstellar medium at distances of a few kpc from the sun. Observations at infrared and microwave wavelengths, where the bulk of the interstellar dust absorbs and radiates, have brought us closer {{to an understanding of the}} distribution of the dust particles on scales of the Galaxy and the Universe. We are in the midst of a scientific revolution in our understanding of the interstellar medium and dust. Progress in, and the key results of, this revolution are still difficult to predict. Nevertheless, (a) a physically justified model has been developed for the spatial distribution of absorbing material over the nearest few kiloparsecs, including the Gould belt as a <b>dust</b> <b>container,</b> which gives an accurate estimate of the extinction for any object just in terms of its galactic coordinates. It is also clear that (b) the interstellar medium makes up roughly half the mass of matter in the galactic vicinity of the solar system (the other half is made up of stars, their remnants, and dark matter) and (c) the interstellar medium and, especially, dust, differ substantially in different regions of space, and deep space cannot be understood by only studying nearby space.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, several {{companies}} developed robotic vacuum cleaners, {{a form of}} carpet sweeper usually equipped with limited suction power. Some prominent brands are Roomba, Neato, and bObsweep. These machines move autonomously while collecting surface dust and debris into a dustbin. They can usually navigate around furniture {{and come back to}} a docking station to charge their batteries, and a few are able to empty their <b>dust</b> <b>containers</b> into the dock as well. Most models are equipped with motorized brushes and a vacuum motor to collect dust and debris. While most robotic vacuum cleaners are designed for home use, some models are appropriate for operation in offices, hotels, hospitals, etc.|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} thermally treatable, radioactive mixed waste inventory {{is characterized}} to support {{implementation of the}} commercial, 1214 thermal treatment contract. The existing thermally treatable waste inventory has been identified using a decision matrix developed by Josephson et al. (1996). Similar to earlier waste characterization reports (Place 1993 and 1994), hazardous materials, radionuclides, physical properties, and waste container data are statistically analyzed. In addition, the waste inventory data is analyzed to correlate waste constituent data {{that are important to}} the implementation of the commercial thermal treatment contract for obtaining permits and for process design. The specific waste parameters, which were analyzed, include the following: ``dose equivalent`` curie content, polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) content, identification of containers with PA-related mobile radionuclides (14 C, 12 79 Se, 99 Tc, and U isotopes), tritium content, debris and non-debris content, container free liquid content, fissile isotope content, identification of dangerous waste codes, asbestos containers, high mercury <b>containers,</b> beryllium <b>dust</b> <b>containers,</b> lead containers, overall waste quantities, analysis of container types, and an estimate of the waste compositional split based on the thermal treatment contractor`s proposed process.

30|$|The active {{suppression}} system tested had the following main components (du Plessis and Späth 2014), detecting sensors, electronic control and self-checking system, <b>dust</b> <b>containers</b> and flow nozzles. The electronic control and self-checking system {{are connected to}} the detecting sensor units and discharge assemblies, constantly monitoring the connections so that the system will always be functional when required. The sensor units are so placed as to monitor the entire tunnel area for any methane ignition or coal dust flame. These units are specially designed to react only to certain light wavelengths specific to burning methane and coal dust, thus reducing the risk of a false ignition. The discharge assemblies can be configured for the particular conditions found within a specific mine, the cross-sectional area of the tunnel, and the method of coal extraction being applied. They are also configured to ensure the correct powder distribution for successfully extinguishing an explosion is achieved.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} are: 1) to analyze how much ambient of dust content {{in the vicinity of}} the Container Terminal PT. Pelindo III Banjarmasin Banjarmasin, 2) To analyze the levels of air pollution caused by ambient dust {{in the vicinity of the}} Container Terminal PT. Pelindo III Banjarmasin Banjarmasin, and 3) To analyze the relationship between the amount of dust in the health status of workers and surrounding communities around Container Terminal PT. Pelindo III Banjarmasin Banjarmasin. The average quality of <b>dust</b> ambient at <b>Container</b> Terminal PT. Pelindo III Banjarmasin Banjarmasin has exceeded the threshold required under Regulation 41 of 1999, which amounted to 974. 1 mg/Nm 3 on the location of the terminal entrance and 941. 2 in stacking terminal locations, while in residential areas is still far below the quality standards required namely 51, 5 μg/Nm 3. There is correlation between the quality of <b>dust</b> ambient at <b>Container</b> Terminal PT. Pelindo III Banjarmasin Banjarmasin with public health, with r = - 0. 40. This result shows strong correlation between levels of dust ambient with health workers and communities around the Container Terminal PT. Pelindo III Banjarmasin Banjarmasin. Meanwhile, in the nearby residential areas indicates that there is no significant correlation between level of dust ambient to public health, where r = 0. 40. This indicates that the level of dust content in the Container Terminal PT. Pelindo III Banjarmasin Banjarmasin not too closely related to public health...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{one-step}} hydrothermal {{synthesis of}} 11 Å tobermorite, a cation exchanger, from a unique combination of waste materials is reported. 11 Å tobermorite was prepared from stoicheiometric quantities of cement bypass <b>dust</b> and waste <b>container</b> glass at 100 °C in water. The product also comprised 10 wt. % calcite and trace quartz as residual parent phases from the cement bypass dust. In a batch sorption study at 20 °C the uptakes of Cd 2 + and Pb 2 + by the waste-derived tobermorite product {{were found to}} be 171 mg g− 1 and 467 mg g− 1, respectively, and in both cases the removal process could be described using a simple pseudo-second-order rate model (k 2 = 2. 30 × 10 − 5 g mg− 1 min− 1 and 5. 09 × 10 − 5 g mg− 1 min− 1, respectively).

40|$|We used HPLC to {{test for}} a {{differential}} effect of atmospheric deposition on coastal phytoplankton of Barcelona and Blanes, a neighboring town subjected to a lower anthropogenic aerosol influence. We performed three microcosm experiments: one in winter (in Barcelona) and two in spring (one in Blanes and one in Barcelona). In each experiment, we incubated six containers with 15 L of coastal seawater pre-filtered through 150 μm at the temperature and light cycle of the respective time of the year. We added 0. 8 mg L- 1 of Saharan <b>dust</b> to two <b>containers,</b> 0. 8 mg L- 1 of anthropogenic dust to other two, and the remaining were used as controls. Samples for pigment analysis by HPLC were collected {{at the beginning and}} at the end of the experiments. In the two experiments from Barcelona, Fucoxantin was always the predominant pigment in both treatments, indicating the dominance of diatoms. However, in Blanes, Zeaxantin predominated initially, indicating the presence of Cyanobacteria, while Fucoxantin, 19 ’-butanoyloxyfucoxanthin and 19 '-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin, and Chlorophyll-c 2 prevailed at the end.

The ELT technique involves containerless suspension of a microdroplet thus eliminating <b>dust,</b> dirt, and <b>container</b> walls which normally cause heterogeneous nucleation. This allows very high supersaturations to be achieved. A theoretical study of the experimental results obtained for the water activity in microdroplets of various electrolyte solutions {{is based on the}} development of the Cahn-Hilliard formalism for electrolyte solutions. In the approach suggested the metastable state for electrolyte solutions is described in terms of the conserved order parameter omega(r,t) associated with fluctuations of the mean solute concentration n(sub 0). Parameters of the corresponding Ginzburg-Landau free energy functional which defines the dynamics of metastable state relaxation are determined and expressed through the experimentally measured quantities. A correspondence of 96 - 99 % between theory and experiment for all solutions studied was achieved and allowed the determination of an analytical expression for the spinodal concentration n(sub spin), and its calculation for various electrolyte solutions at 298 K. The assumption that subcritical solute clusters consist of the electrically neutral Bjerrum pairs has allowed both analytical and numerical investigation of the number-size N(sub c) of nucleation monomers (aggregates of the Bjerrum pairs) which are elementary units of the solute critical clusters. This has also allowed estimations for the surface tension Alpha, and equilibrium bulk energy Beta per solute molecule in the nucleation monomers. The dependence of these properties on the temperature T and on the solute concentration n(sub 0) through the entire metastable zone (from saturation concentration n(sub sat) to spinodal n(sub spin) is examined. It has been demonstrated that there are the following asymptotics: N(sub c), = I at spinodal concentration and N(sub c) = infinity at saturation...|$|R
