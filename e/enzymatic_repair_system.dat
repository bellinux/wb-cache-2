40|$|Maintaining the {{integrity}} of the genome is critical for the survival of any organism. To achieve this, many families of <b>enzymatic</b> <b>repair</b> <b>systems</b> which recognize and repair DNA damage have evolved. Perhaps most intriguing about the workings of these <b>repair</b> <b>systems</b> is the actual damage recognition process. What are the chemical characteristics which are common to sites of nucleic acid damage that DNA repair proteins may exploit in targeting sites? Importantly, thermodynamic and kinetic principles, as much as structural factors, make damage sites distinct from the native DNA bases, and indeed, in many cases, these are the features which are believed to be exploited by repair enzymes. Current proposals for damage recognition may not fulfill all of the demands required of <b>enzymatic</b> <b>repair</b> <b>systems</b> given the sheer size of many genomes, and the efficiency with which the genome is screened for damage. Here we discuss current models for how DNA damage recognition may occur and the chemical characteristics, shared by damaged DNA sites, of which repair proteins may take advantage. These include recognition based upon the thermodynamic and kinetic instabilities associated with aberrant sites. Additionally, we describe how small changes in base pair structure can alter also the unique electronic properties of the DNA base pair π-stack. Further, we describe photophysical, electrochemical, and biochemical experiments in which mismatches and other local perturbations in structure are detected using DNA-mediated charge transport. Finally, we speculate as to how this DNA electron transfer chemistry might be exploited by repair enzymes in order to scan the genome for sites of damage...|$|R
40|$|The genomes {{of living}} organisms are under {{constant}} bombardment from various sources, including chemical modification stemming from processes within the organisms themselves or from exogenous agents, and from radiation. These sources of genomic damage may induce structural {{changes in the}} genome’s most basic functional units, the nucleotides that comprise DNA. Damage to an organism’s DNA may result {{in the production of}} dysfunctional or nonfunctional proteins. Failure to repair such damage may result in the compounding of successive mutations within the organism’s genome, the pathogenesis of cancer and various genetic disorders in humans. To ensure their viability, organisms have developed unique defense mechanisms to combat genetic damage. Among these mechanisms are repair pathways that allow for the enzymatic correction of DNA lesions. The human ALKBH 2 protein (ABH 2), an α‐ketoglutarate/Fe(II) -dependent dioxygenase, represents one such DNA repair enzyme. ABH 2 represents a relatively novel and potentially fruitful subject for cancer research. ABH 2 repairs alkylation damage in DNA through oxidative demethylation, displaying relative specificity for 1 - methyladenine (m 1 A) and 3 -methylcytosine (m 3 C) lesions. In addition to understanding how <b>enzymatic</b> <b>repair</b> <b>systems</b> correct certain DNA defects, it is important to thoroughly analyze the factors that influence the functioning of these catalytic protein complexes and the conditions that allow these systems to function optimally. While several studies have already independently examined the factors associated with ABH 2 enzyme functioning, a comprehensive analysis of these determinants has yet to be conducted. The purpose of this project is to determine how variations in several known factors required for the functioning of this enzyme affects its kinetics. Completion of this project provided an in-depth analysis of the effect that changes in α-ketoglutarate, iron (II), ascorbic acid, pH, and temperature have on the correction of m 1 A, and m 3 C DNA lesions by the ABH 2 repair enzyme. The results indicate that the optimal operating conditions for ABH 2 may differ from what has been previously reported in the literature on this subject...|$|R

Mutations in their coding genes have been observed in familial and sporadic forms of pediatric and adult-onset clinical phenotypes featuring mtDNA instability. The list of defects involved in these disorders has recently expanded, including mutations in the exo-/endo-nuclease flap-processing proteins MGME 1 and DNA 2, supporting the notion that an <b>enzymatic</b> DNA <b>repair</b> <b>system</b> actively takes place in mitochondria. The results obtained {{in the last few years}} acknowledge the contribution of next-generation sequencing methods in the identification of new disease loci in small groups of patients and even single probands. Although heterogeneous, these genes can be conveniently classified according to the pathway to which they belong. The definition of the molecular and biochemical features of these pathways might be helpful for fundamental knowledge of these disorders, to accelerate genetic diagnosis of patients and the development of rational therapies.

We tested several lines of Escherichia coli, derived from a common ancestor and evolved for 20, 000 generations, for their recombination ability.

40|$|DNA repair {{processes}} are crucial in maintaining genome integrity. Postreplication <b>repair</b> <b>systems</b> target specific misincorporations which occur during DNA replication.

The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the roles of very short patch repair, mismatch repair and nucleotide excision <b>repair</b> <b>systems,</b> and their interactions in the presence of mutagen induced lesions caused by 2 -aminopurine and 5 -azacytidine. We have examined the regulation of the dcm and vsr genes of the very short patch <b>repair</b> <b>system,</b> and have found that Vsr is growth phase regulated while Dcm levels remain constant throughout the various stages of the cell's growth. The Vsr regulation was also found to be post-transcriptional and also, although to a lesser extent, operon structure regulated. This helps explain why 5 -methylcytosines are hotspots for mutations in E. coli. We have shown that Dcm, the only cytosine methyltransferase in E. coli, when bound to its target site CCWGG and in the presence of mutagens, 2 -aminopurine and 5 -azacytidine, affects DNA repair and replication, respectively. Our results indicate that the 2 -aminopurine effect is due to increased mispairing of 5 -methycytosines with 2 -aminopurine compared to normal cytosine. 5 -azacytidine stimulates C-to-G mutations which are independent of the methylase. We have evidence which suggests that the lesions leading to the C-to-G mutations are C-C mismatches.

40|$|In {{concrete}} <b>repair</b> <b>systems,</b> {{material properties}} of the repair material and the interface are greatly influenced by the moisture exchange between the repair material and the substrate. If the substrate is dry, it can absorb water from the repair material and reduce its effective water-to-cement ratio (w/c). This further affects the hydration rate of cement based material. In addition to the change in hydration rate, void content at the interface between the two materials is also affected. In this research, the influence of moisture exchange on the void content in the <b>repair</b> <b>system</b> {{as a function of}} initial saturation level of the substrate is investigated. <b>Repair</b> <b>systems</b> with varying level of substrate saturation are made. Moisture exchange in these <b>repair</b> <b>systems</b> as a function of time is monitored by the X-ray absorption technique. After a specified curing age (3 d), the internal microstructure of the <b>repair</b> <b>systems</b> was captured by micro-computed X-ray tomography (CT-scanning). From reconstructed images, different phases in the <b>repair</b> <b>system</b> (<b>repair</b> material, substrate, voids) can be distinguished. In order to quantify the void content, voids were thresholded and their percentage was calculated. It was found that significantly more voids form when the substrate is dry prior to application of the repair material. Air, initially filling voids and pores of the dry substrate, is being released due to the moisture exchange. As a result, air voids remain entrapped in the repair material close to the interface. These voids are found to form as a continuation of pre-existing surface voids in the substrate. Knowledge about moisture exchange and its effects provides engineers with the basis for recommendations about substrate preconditioning in practice.
