These forces stormed the capital on 13 April 2006, but were ultimately repelled. Chad's greatest foreign influence is France, which maintains 1,000 soldiers in the country. Déby relies on the French to help repel the rebels, and France gives the Chadian army logistical and intelligence support for fear of a complete collapse of regional stability. Nevertheless, Franco-Chadian relations were soured by the granting of oil drilling rights to the American Exxon company in 1999.|$|E

40|$|We {{compared}} five {{subgroups of}} aggressive youth (n = 1, 723, Grades 5 through 10) {{on a number}} of adjustment correlates. The subgroups were determined by the self-reported functions (i. e., “why”) of their aggressive behavior: (a) an “instru-mental ” <b>group</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> high on instrumental reasons only; (b) a “reactive” <b>group</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> high on reactive reasons only; (c) a “both ” <b>group</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> high on both dimensions; (d) a “typical ” <b>group</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> moderate on both dimen-sions; and (e) a “neither ” <b>group</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> low on both dimensions. The reactive and both groups showed consistent maladaptive patterns across the adjustment correlates. The instrumental and typical groups both showed generally adaptive and well-adjusted patterns. Surprisingly, the neither group revealed high levels of aggressive acts and showed consistent maladaptive patterns on the correlates. These distinct profiles highlight the utility of a typological approach to classifying aggressive youth and have implications for both assessment and intervention. Antisocial and aggressive behaviors are a leading cause of referral to inpatient and outpatient clinics during adolescence, accounting fo...|$|R

25|$|Indigenous peoples, {{also known}} as first peoples, {{aboriginal}} peoples, native peoples, or autochthonous peoples, are ethnic <b>groups</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> the original inhabitants of a given region, in contrast to groups that have settled, occupied or colonized the area more recently. Groups are usually described as indigenous when they maintain traditions or other aspects of an early culture {{that is associated with}} a given region. Not all indigenous peoples share this characteristic, sometimes having adopted substantial elements of a colonising culture, such as dress, religion or language. Indigenous peoples may be settled in a given region (sedentary) or exhibit a nomadic lifestyle across a large territory, but they are generally historically associated with a specific territory on which they depend. Indigenous societies are found in every inhabited climate zone and continent of the world.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{large and}} vocal group of Koreans (consisting {{of a number of}} animal welfare <b>groups)</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> against the {{practice}} of eating dogs. Popular television shows like 'I Love Pet' have documented, in 2011 for instance, the continued illegal sale of dog meat and slaughtering of dogs in suburban areas. The program also televised illegal dog farms and slaughterhouses, showing the unsanitary and horrific conditions of caged dogs, several of which were visibly sick with severe eye infections and malnutrition. However, despite this growing awareness, there remain some in Korea that do not eat or enjoy the meat, but do feel that it is the right of others to do so, along with a smaller but still vocal group of pro-dog cuisine people who want to popularize the consumption of dog in Korea {{and the rest of the}} world. A group of pro-dog meat individuals attempted to promote and publicize the consumption of dog meat worldwide during the run-up to the 2002 FIFA World Cup, co-hosted by Japan and South Korea, which prompted retaliation from animal rights campaigners and prominent figures such as Brigitte Bardot to denounce the practice. Opponents of dog meat consumption in South Korea are critical of the eating of dog meat, as some dogs are beaten, burnt or hanged to make their meat more tender.|$|E
