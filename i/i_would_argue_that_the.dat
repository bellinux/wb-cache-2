In his view, the third-world creations of the mind could be {{interpreted}} by the second-world mind and used to affect the first-world of matter. An example might be radio, {{an example of the}} interpretation of the third-world (Maxwell's electromagnetic theory) by the second-world mind to suggest modifications of the external first world. The body-mind problem is the question of whether and how our thought processes in World 2 are bound up with brain events in World 1. ...<b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first and oldest of these attempted solutions {{is the only one that}} deserves to be taken seriously namely: World 2 and World 1 interact, so that when someone reads a book or listens to a lecture, brain events occur that act upon the World 2 of the reader's or listener's thoughts; and conversely, when a mathematician follows a proof, his World 2 acts upon his brain and thus upon World 1.

40|$|For almost 35 {{years the}} work {{carried out by}} the Brazilian artist Lygia Clark between the 1950 s and until her death, in 1988, has {{attracted}} the attention of both Brazilian and European scholars and critics. Since special attention has only been given to her post- 1969 work, the work carried out until 1969 has been overlooked. In particular, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> through the incorporation of the human body Clark's 1959 - 1964 Bicho series is the first spatial performative strategy developed by Clark during the 1960 s and against which all her subsequent production needs to be read. The present essay is thus an attempt to read as spatial performative strategies Clark's Bicho series with and against the Brazilian reception of Mondrian, reception which, as <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> has been overlooked in the context of her work. Furthermore, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> {{in order for us to}} better understand how the Bicho series unfold as spatial performative strategies the Brazilian reception of Mondrian must be approached through the Brazilian reception of Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology and political and cultural movements of the time. While the role played by Merleau-Ponty's incorporation of the human body in Clark's work has not been closely examined, Clark's engagement with the political and cultural movements of her time has been underestimated. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> any attempt to give an account of Clark's practice needs to take into consideration the role these three aspects played in her engagement with the problem of representation...|$|R

30|$|The first {{possibility}} is that the workers who have left an industrial sector have been marginalized by the rapid changes around them.

Given that the analysis in this paper is restricted to working age individuals, the outcome of labor force withdrawal seems particularly negative. Even if the workers have found new jobs, {{it may be that}} they have joined the ranks of the subsistence farmers who now account for a large fraction of Romanian employment. 8 If the data shows that unemployment, labor force withdrawal, and subsistence farming are the predominant destinations for workers leaving industry, then <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> down-sizing of industry has not been successful in releasing labor to other uses.

40|$|My own {{explanation}} {{and the first}} part of my hypothesis is that the Catholic Church, as an institution that is involved in so much more than merely professing the Christian faith, has a double agenda. That is to say, as the largest single institution propagating the Christian faith, it is a spiritual 'world power', however, as an institution, this is supplemented with worldly, economic and political motivations that are prone to obstruct the execution of its role as moral arbitrator. Besides religion, the Catholic Church as an institution has many other interests. It strives to obtain as many followers as possible, (implicitly) aspiring to expand its authority; and tries to further the interests of the institution in a society. Therefore, the Catholic Church {{is more than just a}} spiritual institution.
