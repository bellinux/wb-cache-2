5|$|Iceland's {{financial}} position has steadily improved since the crash. The economic contraction and rise in unemployment {{appear to have}} been arrested by late 2010 and with growth under way in mid-2011. Three main factors have been important in this regard. First is the emergency legislation passed by the Icelandic parliament in October 2008. It served to minimise the impact of the financial crisis on the country. The <b>Financial</b> <b>Supervisory</b> <b>Authority</b> of Iceland used permission granted by the emergency legislation to take over the domestic operations of the three largest banks. The much larger foreign operations of the banks, however, went into receivership.|$|E
5|$|On 29 September 2008, it was {{announced}} that Glitnir would be nationalised. However, subsequent efforts to restore faith in the banking system failed. On 6 October, the Icelandic legislature instituted an emergency law which enabled the <b>Financial</b> <b>Supervisory</b> <b>Authority</b> (FME) to take control over financial institutions and made domestic deposits in the banks priority claims. In the following days, new banks were founded to take over the domestic operations of Kaupthing, Landsbanki and Glitnir. The old banks were put into receivership and liquidation, resulting in losses for their shareholders and foreign creditors. Outside Iceland, {{more than half a million}} depositors lost access to their accounts in foreign branches of Icelandic banks. This led to the 2008–2013 Icesave dispute, that ended with a ESA ruling that Iceland was not obliged to repay Dutch and British depositors minimum deposit guarantees.|$|E

25|$|Iceland {{had been}} hit {{especially}} hard by the Great Recession that began in December 2007, because {{of the failure of}} its banking system and a subsequent economic crisis. Before the crash of the country's three largest banks, Glitnir, Landsbanki and Kaupthing, their combined debt exceeded approximately six times the nation's gross domestic product of €14billion ($19billion). In October 2008, the Icelandic parliament passed emergency legislation to minimise the impact of the Financial crisis. The <b>Financial</b> <b>Supervisory</b> <b>Authority</b> of Iceland used permission granted by the emergency legislation to take over the domestic operations of the three largest banks. Icelandic officials, including central bank governor Davíð Oddsson, stated that the state did not intend to take over any of the banks' foreign debts or assets. Instead, new banks were established to take on the domestic operations of the banks, and the old banks will be run into bankruptcy.|$|E

Nýi Glitnir was set up on 15 October with 110 billion krónur in equity and 1,200 billion krónur of assets. Nýja Kaupþing was set up on 22 October with 75 billion krónur in equity and 700 billion krónur of assets. The equity in all three new banks was supplied by the Icelandic government, and amounted to 30% of Iceland's GDP. The new banks {{will also have to}} reimburse their predecessors for the net value of the transferred assets, as determined by [...] "recognised appraisers".
