40|$|The {{phytohormone}} auxin is {{an essential}} regulator for plant growth and <b>development.</b> <b>Decades</b> of intensive research revealed the mutual importance of auxin metabolism and intercellular cell-to-cell transport for the regulation of spatiotemporal auxin distribution. Just recently, intracellular putative auxin carriers, such as the PIN-FORMED (PIN) 5 /PIN 8 and the PIN-LIKES (PILS) 2 /PILS 5 were discovered at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and seem to limit nuclear auxin signaling via an auxin sequestration mechanism. Moreover, these auxin carriers at the ER might provide a link between auxin compartmentalization and auxin conjugation-based metabolism. Here we review the recent findings on auxin compartmentalization at the ER and discuss its potential contribution to cellular auxin homeostasis and its importance for plant development...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{mechanisms}} that guide axons through a complex cellular landscape to reach appro-priate target cells {{are central to}} our understanding of neural <b>development.</b> <b>Decades</b> of work suggest that guid-ance information is interpreted by signaling machinery that controls the complex and dynamic cytoskeleton at the growth cone leading edge. Recent insights from the areas of signal transduction and cell biology have iden-tified a number of key components that play central roles in this chain of command, including members of the Ena/VASP and WASP family of proteins. Although our understanding of the precise mechanism by which these proteins control actin assembly is still incomplete, these players are emerging as potential sites of integra-tion that translate convergent signals into directional cell movement. This brief review explores some of the most recent articles on this topic. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons...|$|R
