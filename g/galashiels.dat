5|$|The final {{figures for}} 2015/16 for each station were as follows: Brunstane (165,978), Newcraighall (224,026), Eskbank (128,298), Shawfair (13,202), Newtongrange (86,298), Gorebridge (59,304), Stow (39,656), <b>Galashiels</b> (213,760) and Tweedbank (300,602).|$|E
5|$|Dunston A had a {{generating}} capacity of 48.85 megawatts (MW) in 1955, and Dunston B had a {{generating capacity}} of 300 MW. Electricity from the stations powered an area covering Northumberland, County Durham, Cumberland, Yorkshire {{and as far}} north as <b>Galashiels</b> in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|The first sod {{was turned}} at <b>Galashiels</b> on 3 March 2010, when Scottish {{transport}} minister Stewart Stevenson attended a ceremony {{in the presence}} of campaigner Madge Elliot. This triggered a clause in the 2006 Waverley Railway Act, which committed the Scottish Government to complete the line to Tweedbank once works had been commenced.|$|E
5|$|The Transport Scotland Business Case for Borders Railway, {{published}} in November 2012, {{predicted that the}} total passenger return journeys made {{for the first year}} of operation would be 647,136. In some cases these included extra journeys. This was broken down into Edinburgh Park (4,071), Haymarket (35,329), Edinburgh Waverley (220,533), Brunstane and Newcraighall combined (986), Shawfair (61,860), Eskbank (130,525), Newtongrange (52,918), Gorebridge (90,019), Stow (5,843), <b>Galashiels</b> (23,431) and Tweedbank (21,621).|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} month, {{the actual number}} of {{passengers}} was 125,971, compared to the predicted annual total of around 650,000 return journeys, i.e. 1.3m single journeys. By 23 January 2016, 537,327 passengers had been carried on the line with weekly figures consistently showing over 20,000 journeys made. Figures released on 31 May 2016 showed that 694,373 persons had been carried since 6 September 2015, an increase of 22% by reference to the predicted patronage. Tweedbank station saw 183,918 journeys compared to a predicted 18,978, while <b>Galashiels</b> had 104,593 trips against a predicted 20,567. However, Eskbank, Gorebridge and Shawfair recorded less than their predicted usage. In September 2016, it was announced that one million passengers had been carried on the reopened line.|$|E
5|$|Amongst the line's 27 {{substantial}} structures, {{the greatest}} engineering challenge was {{posed by the}} point where the track met the Edinburgh City Bypass. At that point, a tunnel had to be constructed under the A720 road while it had been temporarily diverted; in total, the project incorporated five new associated road schemes. Major challenges were also posed by abandoned mine shafts {{to the north of the}} route, some of which dated to the 16th century and had not been mapped. More than 200 bridges were involved in the scheme, as the route crosses the Gala Water and River Tweed nineteen times. One of the most vital bridges on the line carries the track over Hardengreen roundabout on the A7, and required extensive works throughout 2013. Other works included digging out an infilled cutting on the outskirts of <b>Galashiels</b> and reconstructing a nearby bridge to allow the line to pass under power lines.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Rhodes left school, aged 16, he had joined Kirkheaton Cricket Club {{and started to}} take cricket seriously: he watched Yorkshire when they played close to his home and began to {{consider}} {{a career as a}} professional cricketer. Around 1893 he took a job working on the railway in the local town of Mirfield. By now playing regularly for Kirkheaton Second XI, Rhodes's keenness to reach one game on time led him to ring the off-duty bell {{before the end of the}} shift and as a result he lost his job. Subsequently, he worked on a local farm, which allowed him more time for cricket. By 1895 he achieved a place in the Kirkheaton first team, and was recommended to Gala Cricket Club, of <b>Galashiels,</b> Scotland, as a professional.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes {{played for}} Gala Cricket Club in 1896 and 1897, as an all-rounder {{who opened the}} batting and bowled medium paced seamers. He took 92 wickets in his first season, and {{discovered}} that bowling an occasional slow ball brought him some success. He decided to change his bowling style to spin, and spent the winter of 1896â€“97 practising on the family farm while also working again on the railway, this time as a signalman. Over several months, Rhodes used his practice sessions to develop control of spin and different types of delivery. Consequently, {{in his second season}} at <b>Galashiels,</b> now bowling slow left-arm, he took fewer wickets but at a better average. At the end of the 1897 season, encouraged by a Scottish member of the MCC, he resigned from Gala to look for work in England.|$|E

25|$|Heriot-Watt's Scottish Borders Campus in <b>Galashiels</b> {{is home to}} the University's School of Textile and Design. The School began life in 1883 {{when the}} <b>Galashiels</b> Manufacturer's Corporation began running classes in {{practical}} courses for its workers. The institution gradually grew both in terms of student numbers and the number of courses it offered, and it ultimately became known as the Scottish College of Textiles in 1968. In 1998 the College merged with Heriot-Watt, leading {{to the creation of the}} School of Textiles and Design in its modern form.|$|E

25|$|The SRU {{decided to}} turn these {{standard}} Districts into four professional teams based roughly on the old districts: the Border Reivers based in <b>Galashiels</b> (with occasional matches elsewhere), the Caledonia Reds based in Aberdeen and Perth, Edinburgh and Glasgow.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a further}} {{education}} training centre in the town. Northumberland College in Berwick-upon-Tweed is eight miles (13km) away and full-time further and higher education courses are offered at Borders College and Heriot-Watt University's textiles campus in <b>Galashiels.</b>|$|E
25|$|Through 1991, the <b>Galashiels</b> {{co-operative}} expanded through mergers {{to serve}} the Scottish Borders and Dumfries and Galloway regions. In 1992, Border Regional Co-operative Society merged with East Lothian Co-operative Society (based in Tranent), becoming Lothian and Borders Co-operative Society. In 1998, it absorbed East Angus Co-operative Society of Arbroath, taking its final name and structure.|$|E

There was also further {{consolidation}} of sub-units, with D (King's Own Scottish Borderers) Company, based in <b>Galashiels,</b> amalgamating with A (Royal Scots) Company, to reflect {{the formation of the}} regular Royal Scots Borderers.|$|E
25|$|Rodney Williams, Ali's father, {{was born}} in Kent, then moved and played rugby for Blackheath. His mother, Helen, {{was born in}} Carlisle, England, and her mother, Doreen, comes from <b>Galashiels,</b> Scotland. Rodney and Helen emigrated to New Zealand after they married, and Williams was born there. By birth, he was {{qualified}} to play for New Zealand; through his parents, he was eligible to play for England; and through his maternal grandmother he was eligible to play for Scotland. Through his mother, he is related to Donald Fairgrieve, former president of Gala RFC in the Scottish Borders, and also to former Scottish scrum-half Arthur Dorward (a cousin of his maternal grandfather), who played 15 Tests between 1950 and 1957. His younger brother, Jay, is also a rugby footballer, who plays at lock for Auckland.|$|E
500|$|The {{final section}} of {{double-track}} begins at Galabank Junction on {{the approach to}} [...] Stow where a [...] loop is entered by a [...] turnout before proceeding through several reverse curves and the [...] Bowshank Tunnel to reach Bowland Points. The speed limit drops from [...] to [...] through Bowland. The last [...] stretch to <b>Galashiels</b> and Tweedbank is entirely single-track save for the approach to Tweedbank. The [...] Torwoodlee Tunnel is traversed just before <b>Galashiels</b> and four river crossings are made in under [...] which required new bridge spans. At <b>Galashiels,</b> due to trackbed encroachment, the line deviates eastwards between a steep bank and the side wall of a supermarket which occupies the former station site. For the final [...] to Tweedbank, the line follows its original alignment over a reconstructed embankment and through an excavated cutting before crossing the River Tweed on the Category B listed Redbridge Viaduct.|$|E
500|$|The [...] long route serves Tweedbank, <b>Galashiels,</b> Stow, Gorebridge, Newtongrange, Eskbank, Shawfair, Newcraighall, Brunstane and Edinburgh Waverley stations, {{with a total}} {{running time}} of 55 minutes for most {{services}}. Certain services are slowed due to conflicts with other operators' services in the Edinburgh area. None of the new stations are staffed, but ticket machines and train information have been provided. All stations other than <b>Galashiels</b> have park and ride facilities; at <b>Galashiels,</b> the local council built a Â£5.2 million bus/rail interchange. The station at Stow was a late addition to the scheme after lobbying by the Campaign for Borders Rail. Campaigning also resulted in platforms at the line's Tweedbank terminus being extended to , so as to accommodate tourist charter trains of up to 10â€“12 carriages in length. Passive provision has been made for the extension of all other station platforms from [...] to [...] Eskbank station is convenient for an Edinburgh College campus, {{as well as the}} Midlothian Community Hospital.|$|E
500|$|In February 2013, {{the final}} {{business}} case {{was released by}} the Scottish Government, which showed a benefit-cost ratio of just 0.5:1. This led the journal Local Transport Today to comment that the line was [...] "one of the worst-performing major transport projects to be funded in recent times." [...] The Campaign for Borders Rail responded stating that the ratio was based on modelling that underestimated the route's potential patronage, predicting only 23,431 yearly return trips from <b>Galashiels</b> equivalent to only 70 passengers a day or three per train, which would be less than the number using the existing bus service.|$|E
500|$|In {{terms of}} gradients, the line {{proceeds}} {{on the level}} until Eskbank where it climbs to the summit at Falahill (880 feet above sea level) at a ruling gradient of 1 in 70 and then descends at a typical gradient of 1 in 150 into <b>Galashiels</b> and Tweedbank. Falahill is the tenth highest standard gauge railway summit in Britain, just [...] lower than Shap summit. The Fushiebridge loop is on a 1 in 70 gradient and climbs southwards up the Borthwick Bank which had posed a challenge {{in the past for}} steam locomotives pulling heavy loads.|$|E
500|$|In July 2005, the {{committee}} gave approval to a reopening to {{as far as}} <b>Galashiels.</b> During a lengthy period of consultation for the proposed line, passenger services were reintroduced on the surviving freight-only section of the Waverley Route between Portobello Junction and Millerhill. Brunstane and Newcraighall stations opened on 3 June 2002, the latter being [...] from Edinburgh, providing a park-and-ride service to the city. The new service was termed Edinburgh Crossrail, and extended from Newcraighall through to Edinburgh Waverley, and continued either onto the North Clyde Line or the Fife Circle Line. Initially operated with diesel multiple units, the service from Newcraighall through to the North Clyde Line was electrified as a byproduct of the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link. The service from Newcraighall to Dalmeny and through to the Fife Circle Line continued to use diesel trains. Crossrail was a success, and provided forward momentum for the Borders Railway project.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{recommendations}} in the Scott Wilson report, political {{pressure on the}} Scottish Government to reconnect the Borders region eventually resulted in it giving support to {{the extension of the}} Edinburgh commuter network by [...] as far as the <b>Galashiels</b> area. Pressure came in particular from the Campaign for Borders Rail on behalf of which Petra Biberbach in February 2000 presented a petition with 17,261 signatures to the Public Petitions Committee of the Scottish Parliament. The petition received the unanimous support of the Parliament's Rural Affairs Committee which submitted it to the Parliamentary Chamber for debate. The Scottish Borders Council, Midlothian Council, City of Edinburgh Council, Scottish Enterprise Borders, Borders Transport Futures, Railtrack and ScotRail bid for Â£1.9 million from the Scottish Executive's Public Transport Fund to allow a Parliamentary Order for reopening as far as Tweedbank to be taken forward. Once funding had been obtained, the three local authorities created the Waverley Railway Joint Committee to promote the scheme.|$|E
500|$|The Borders Railway {{connects the}} city of Edinburgh with <b>Galashiels</b> and Tweedbank in the Scottish Borders. The railway follows most of the {{alignment}} of {{the northern part of}} the Waverley Route, a former double-track line in southern Scotland and northern England that ran between Edinburgh and Carlisle. That line was controversially closed in 1969, as part of the Beeching cuts, leaving the Borders region without any access to the National Rail network. Following the closure, a campaign to revive the Waverley Route emerged. Discussion on reopening {{the northern part of the}} line came to a head during the early 2000s. Following deliberations in the Scottish Parliament, the Waverley Railway (Scotland) Act 2006 received Royal Assent in June 2006. The project was renamed the [...] "Borders Railway" [...] in August 2008, and building works began in November 2012. Passenger service on the line began on 6 September 2015, whilst an official opening by Queen Elizabeth II took place on 9 September.|$|E
500|$|In 1992, Borders {{architect}} Simon Longland {{conducted a}} motorbike {{survey of the}} route which led him {{to set up the}} company Borders Transport Futures to evaluate the possibility of reopening. Having carried out feasibility work, in 1997 the company came close to lodging Parliamentary plans to reopen the -- section for timber traffic. Based on the company's groundwork, the Campaign for Borders Rail, founded in 1999, was able to advance a project to reopen a section between <b>Galashiels</b> and Tweedbank to passengers. The first moves came in 1999 when the Scottish Parliament supported a motion by Christine Grahame MSP which called for the reinstatement of the line as a means of reversing the economic decline of the Borders region. This was followed by a Â£400,000 feasibility study conducted by Scott Wilson and commissioned by the Scottish Office which reported in February 2000 that there were [...] "no insurmountable planning or environmental constraints" [...] to reinstatement as much of the original line could be reused, although several major obstacles would need to be overcome which would entail substantial costs.|$|E
500|$|The first {{track was}} {{laid in the}} Bowshank Tunnel on 4 April 2014. On 30 September 2014, the first train on the Waverley Route for 45 years â€“ a works train â€“ ran to Newcraighall. Tracklaying began in earnest on 6 October 2014, {{although}} preliminary works had resulted in a section of slab track laid through Bowshank Tunnel, south of Stow, as well as ballasting along large sections of the route and pre-cast switch and crossing units for the passing loops. The {{first part of the}} route to be ballasted was the section through Lothianbridge Viaduct to which structural repairs had to be carried out. By the end of October, more than [...] of track had been laid as far as Tynehead and the double-track on the Shawfair loop had been completed plus [...] of the second track on the Borthwick loop. Work was halted in late November 2014 after a contractor working for BAM Nuttall in the Gala area was injured when a sleeper came loose when being lifted into position and landed on his leg. Work restarted on 12 January 2015 following a review by BAM of their track installation methodology. By 3 February, the track was complete through <b>Galashiels</b> and hundreds of spectators turned out to welcome the first train into the station since 1969, which was hauled by GBRf Class 66761 and 66741.|$|E

Scottish venues included Murrayfield Stadium, {{the home of the}} Scottish Rugby Union Hampden Park, the home of the Scottish Football Association and the smallest venue in the 1999 tournament, Netherdale, in <b>Galashiels,</b> in the Scottish Borders. Venues in Ireland included Lansdowne Road, the traditional home of the Irish Rugby Football Union, Ravenhill and Thomond Park. France used five venues, the most of any nation, including the French national stadium, Stade de France, which hosted the final of both the 1998 FIFA World Cup and the 2007 Rugby World Cup.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} of his {{marriage}} aged 23, he was already a successful architect. Between 1846 and 1858 he designed over 30 churches in England, at the rate of over two a year, a phenomenal output. As this was an era of massive church restoration (Nikolaus Pevsner has said many churches were [...] "over-restored" [...] during this time) it is possible that this high figure may include churches Wardell only redesigned or restored. Whatever the true number of churches he designed in England, this was a period not only of church restoration but also building of many new Roman Catholic Churches. Wardell's work wasn't just limited to England though. He was commissioned by Robert Hope-Scott and his wife, of Abbotsford, Melrose, to build a church for the growing Roman Catholic community in the nearby town of <b>Galashiels.</b> The designs drawn, work began in 1856 and wouldn't be completed for another 20 years. Our Lady & Saint Andrew's is still in use as the Parish Church to this day. Wardell and John Newman were {{by no means the only}} converts to Catholicism; a large number of notable intellectuals too changed their faith. This, coupled with the greater freedom Catholics obtained by the Catholic Emancipation Act which restored the hierarchy and removed some of the prohibitions on Catholics which had prevailed since {{the time of}} the reformation, led to the Catholic Church having a revival in Britain. Thus the newly converted Pugin and his protegÃ© Wardell were well placed to receive the numerous commissions which came flooding in.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the end of}} the war {{memorial}} {{period and}} the onset of the economic depression, Carrick undertook many smaller works including continuing renovations and repairs at George Heriot's School in Edinburgh, Pollok House in Glasgow, and Dunnotar Castle. [...] He also executed several memorial tablets featuring portraits, including that to Sir Walter Scott in Jedburgh and one to the founder of the Boys' Brigade, William A. Smith in St. Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh. [...] The University of Edinburgh also constructed the King's Buildings extension and Carrick was responsible for the stone relief above the doorway of the Geology department, featuring the allegorical figure of Geology studying an ammonite. [...] In the late 1930s he carried out all of the work on Saint Andrew's House, the new government buildings in Edinburgh, to the designs of the London sculptor William Reid Dick. [...] Carrick's last prestigious work was that of the bronze groups 'Safety' and 'Security' which stand on pillars at the entrance to the Caledonian Insurance Building (now GRE Building [...] ) in Saint Andrew Square, Edinburgh. [...] With the outbreak of World War II construction work dried up and conscription claimed most of his students at the college. [...] Carrick was forced into an early retirement and he and his wife Janet settled in their holiday cottage at Midlem in the Scottish Borders. [...] The couple considered creating a studio at the cottage but this never happened.
