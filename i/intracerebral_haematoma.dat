40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} {{the influence of}} family history on the occurrence of stroke. METHODS: A case-control study was carried out from August 1992 to January 1994. The study population comprised 502 patients with a first stroke, aged between 20 and 70 years, who were treated at 48 affiliated hospitals. The same number of age and sex matched controls were selected from outpatients. Diagnoses were based on CT findings and clinical signs. There were 155 case-control pairs for subarachnoid haemorrhage, 158 for <b>intracerebral</b> <b>haematoma,</b> and 159 for cerebral infarction. Information about the {{patients and their families}} was obtained from a questionnaire which included the family histories of each subtype of stroke and other potential risk factors for stroke. The data were analysed focusing {{on the role of the}} family histories in the occurrence of stroke. RESULTS: In univariate analysis, the family histories of subarachnoid haemorrhage and <b>intracerebral</b> <b>haematoma</b> were positively associated with each of the subtypes of stroke (odds ratios 11. 24 for subarachnoid haemorrhage, 2. 39 for <b>intracerebral</b> <b>haematoma),</b> whereas family history of cerebral infarction was not a significant risk factor for its occurrence (odds ratio 1. 41). Family history of <b>intracerebral</b> <b>haematoma</b> was correlated with a personal history of hypertension and habitual alcohol consumption. After adjustment for potential risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, obesity, alcohol consumption, and regular smoking), family history of subarachnoid haemorrhage still remained the most powerful risk factor for subarachnoid haemorrhage, whereas family history of <b>intracerebral</b> <b>haematoma</b> no longer showed a significant association with haematoma. CONCLUSION: Genetic factors play a major part in the pathogenesis of subarachnoid haemorrhage, and family history of subarachnoid haemorrhage is the strongest independent risk factor for the disease. On the other hand, family history of <b>intracerebral</b> <b>haematoma</b> was not an independent risk factor for haematoma, but it might be a good predictor, which indirectly influences the pathogenesis of <b>intracerebral</b> <b>haematoma</b> via certain hereditary components such as hypertension, and even lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption.

40|$|Traumatic <b>intracerebral</b> <b>haematomas</b> are {{a common}} neurosurgical emergency. Their management, {{particularly}} the role of surgical removal, is controversial. Deterioration often occurs late, and is unpredictable. Eight patients with traumatic <b>intracerebral</b> <b>haematomas</b> were admitted to the neurosurgical unit to monitor their clinical state. All were studied within 48 hours of admission with single photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT), using the recently introduced radionuclide 99 Technetiumm-Hexamethyl propylene amine oxime (99 Tcm-HMPAO). At {{the time of the}} SPECT study, all the patients had been clinically stable. Three patients remained so; in the other five, the conscious level deteriorated, necessitating craniotomy and evacuation of the haematoma. In all the patients, the SPECT studies demonstrated perfusion defects that corresponded to the location of the haematoma, as demonstrated by computerised tomography (CT). However, in the five patients who subsequently deteriorated, the perfusion defects seen on the SPECT scan appeared larger than the haematoma, as seen on the CT scan. In addition, there was widespread poor retention of 99 Tcm-HMPAO in the ipsilateral hemisphere. These differences were quantifiable. Interestingly, these differences were present {{at a time when the}} patients were clinically stable, before their deterioration. It is concluded that SPECT studies with 99 Tcm-HMPAO are of possible use as predictors of late deterioration in the management of traumatic <b>intracerebral</b> <b>haematomas...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Non-traumatic acute {{subdural}} haematomas enable {{study of}} the morbidity and mortality due to the haematoma without the effect of trauma. Whereas {{it is known that}} coagulation disorders worsen the outcome of spontaneous <b>intracerebral</b> <b>haematomas,</b> this has not been studied in non-traumatic acute subdural haematomas. METHODS: In a series of 13 non-traumatic acute subdural haematomas admitted to our department between January 1995 and March 2002, we had 9 coagulopathy associated haematomas and 3 haematomas corresponding to the syndrome of 'spontaneous acute subdural haematoma of arterial origin'. Both groups were compared. FINDINGS: Age and gender distribution were comparable. The bleeding source was a cortical artery in 2 of the 2 non-coagulopathy related haematomas operated on, but also in 2 of the 4 coagulopathy associated haematomas that underwent surgery. The average haematoma thickness was higher in the coagulopathy related haematomas. The mean Glasgow Coma Score on admission was 7. 7 and the mortality rate was 55. 6 % in the coagulopathy related group. In the non-coagulopathy related haematomas the mean Glasgow Coma Score was 12. 0 and the mortality rate 33. 3 %. The latter mortality rate corresponds well to that of a historical group of 'spontaneous acute subdural haematomas of arterial origin' collected from the literature. INTERPRETATION: The outcome was worse in the non-traumatic acute subdural haematomas that were associated with a coagulation deficiency. While in all non-traumatic acute subdural haematomas the interval to surgery should be minimized, early recognition and urgent correction of coagulation deficiencies is certainly indicated. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Head {{injury is}} {{an injury to}} scalp, skull and/or {{contents}} of skull. Injury to scalp maybe {{in the form of}} abrasion, contusion or laceration. Common types of skull fractures are simple linear fracture, depressed, base of skull fracture and orbital/blow out fracture. CT scan has been the investigation of choice in head injury cases. Simple linear fracture of skull cases usually require CT scanning. Base of skull fractures are visible in bone window axial CT scans. Cerebral contusions in CT scan appear as small area of haemorrhage in cerebral parenchyma. <b>Intracerebral</b> <b>haematomas</b> appear as hyperdense lesions on CT with associated mass effect and midline shift. Extradural haematomas appear convex in shape on CT and do not expand past suture lines. Subdural haematomas in CT classically appear crescent shaped. Acute bleed are hyperdense whereas chronic bleed can be isodense. A sincere effort has been put in this study to understand the epidemiology and evaluation of head injury following RTA. This study is intended to help the fellow practicing radiological fraternity. MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty three cases were taken up for the study and evaluated by the CT scan of head. Ten axial sections from the base of skull were taken and evaluated. The information collected include age, sex, occupation, alcohol consumption, type of vehicle involved, clinical presentation, CT findings. RESULTS Male sex had the highest incidence of head injury, which accounted for thirty four cases. The age group of twenty one to forty years accounted for highest number of cases in this study, which accounted to twenty four cases. Based on the occupation of the victim, the labourers suffered maximum number of head injuries in RTA, which accounted for twelve admissions. In this study, twenty one percent of the victims had consumed alcohol, which amounted to nine in number. Based on the type of vehicle involved two wheelers amounted to eighteen cases. Based on clinical presentation of the victim following RTA, thirty three cases presented with headache. The CT findings of the cases studied showed skull fractures in nineteen cases. CONCLUSION In this study, it was noted that incidence of head injuries following RTA was more in the age group of twenty one to forty years. It was also noted that male sex outweighed the female sex...|$|R
500|$|The {{nature of}} the head trauma also {{influences}} the risk of PTE. [...] People who suffer depressed skull fractures, penetrating head trauma, early PTS, and <b>intracerebral</b> and subdural <b>haematomas</b> due to the TBI are especially likely to suffer PTE, which occurs in more than 30% of people with {{any one of these}} findings. About 50% of patients with penetrating head trauma develop PTE, and missile injuries and loss of brain volume are associated with an especially high likelihood of developing the condition. [...] Injuries that occur in military settings carry higher-than-usual risk for PTE, probably because they more commonly involve penetrating brain injury and brain damage over a more widespread area. [...] Intracranial hematomas, in which blood accumulates inside the skull, {{are one of the most}} important risk factors for PTE. [...] Subdural hematoma confers a higher risk of PTE than does epidural hematoma, possibly because it causes more damage to brain tissue. Repeated intracranial surgery confers a high risk for late PTE, possibly because people who need more surgery are more likely to have factors associated with worse brain trauma such as large hematomas or cerebral swelling. [...] In addition, the chances of developing PTE differ by the location of the brain lesion: brain contusion that occurs on in one or the other of the frontal lobes has been found to carry a 20% PTE risk, while a contusion in one of the parietal lobes carries a 19% risk and one in a temporal lobe carries a 16% chance. [...] When contusions occur in both hemispheres, the risk is 26% for the frontal lobes, 66% for the parietal, and 31% for the temporal.|$|R

SETTING [...] Helsinki University Hospital. PATIENTS [...] 291 consecutive patients (149 men) aged 15 to 65 years admitted within 96 hours after the bleeding. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Potential risk factors (baseline characteristics, health habits, and clinical variables) for poor outcome after haemorrhage (dependent state {{in the activities of}} daily living, or death) were studied using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS [...] One year after haemorrhage, 179 (62 %) patients were independent in the activities of daily living and 28 (10 %) dependent; 84 (29 %) had died. Risk of poor outcome was predicted, after adjustment for sex and age, by clinical condition at admission according to the Glasgow coma scale (p less than 0. 0001); occurrence of rebleeding (relative risk 7. 1, 95 % confidence interval 2. 8 to 18. 0, p less than 0. 0001) or delayed cerebral ischaemia (10. 3, 4. 2 to 25. 4, p less than 0. 0001); surgery on an aneurysm (0. 13, 0. 05 to 0. 35, p less than 0. 0001); and heavy consumption of alcohol (4. 5, 1. 8 to 11. 0, p = 0. 0014).

We operated ICH, where the diameters of haematomas {{were more than}} 3 cm. Outcome was assessed on basis of activity of daily living (ADL). Male to female ratio was 5 : 2, Patients age ranged 45 to 72 years. All patients presented with unconscious or semiconscious stage, 100 % patients had CT scan of brain. In this study of 49 cases 20 (40. 82 %) had ADL II, 24 (45. 82 %) had ADL III, 1 (2. 4 %) had ADL IV. Death occurred in 04 (8. 16 %) cases...|$|E
40|$|An 82 {{year old}} man was {{referred}} {{to the emergency room}} by his general practitioner for a right frontoparietal headache. The preceding day he had tripped and fallen, hitting {{the back of his head}} on the floor. Computed tomography showed a cortical contre coup haematoma. In view of ventricular standstill noted on ECG, a temporary pacing wire was inserted and a dual chamber permanent pacemaker was subsequently implanted. Intracerebral bleeding was treated conservatively and the patient made a good recovery. All patients admitted with head injury and sinus bradycardia or sinus arrest should be nursed at 15 ° to 30 ° with instructions to avoid the head up and supine positions. Furthermore, brain CT should be promptly recorded to assess for <b>intracerebral</b> <b>haematoma</b> and raised intracranial pressure and, if they are confirmed, these patients with cardiovascular compromise should benefit from close collaboration between neurosurgeon and cardiologist. Urgent pacing should be considered for all patients with head injury who experience symptomatic bradycardia or ventricular standstill...|$|E
