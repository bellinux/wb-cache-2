In recent years Ikata has also become a hotspot of modern energy production—the Ikata Nuclear Power Plant until 2012 produced much of Shikoku's electricity, and the town's windy mountains are dotted by dozens of windmills.|$|E
5|$|In sailing, it <b>has</b> <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> that if {{the bearing}} from the target to the pursuer remains {{constant}}, known as constant bearing, decreasing range (CBDR), equivalent to taking a fixed reference point at infinite distance, the two vessels are on a collision course, both travelling in straight lines. In a simulation, this is readily observed as the lines between the two remain parallel at all times.|$|E

25|$|Fallon, Nevada <b>has</b> <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> to have {{groundwater}} {{with relatively}} high arsenic concentrations (in excess of 0.08mg/L). Even some surface waters, {{such as the}} Verde River in Arizona, sometimes exceed 0.01mg/L arsenic, especially during low-flow periods when the river flow is dominated by groundwater discharge.|$|E
25|$|The genus Tetraplasandra <b>has</b> <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> as a close {{relative}} of the obsolete genera Gastonia, Reynoldsia, and Munroidendron. This was confirmed by a pollen study in 1971. In 2010, Arthrophyllum, Cuphocarpus, Gastonia, Reynoldsia, Munroidendron, and Tetraplasandra were all sunk into Polyscias, raising {{the number of species}} in that genus from about 100 to 159.|$|E
25|$|The area <b>has</b> <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> for its quarries, {{and it was}} {{to serve}} these that the village became the {{terminus}} of the Croydon, Merstham and Godstone Railway, {{an extension of the}} horse-drawn Surrey Iron Railway of 1803, the world's first public railway, albeit only for goods. A small section of the railway is on display at the entrance to Quality Street, Old Merstham. Unfortunately, this section has now been taken.|$|E

25|$|Dorado <b>has</b> <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> as a golf haven. Its tourist {{industry}} includes the Dorado Beach Resort(Ritz-Carlton Reserve & Plantation), the Hyatt Hacienda del Mar, and Embassy Suites in the Dorado Del Mar neighborhood.

The Dorado del Mar course closed in 2014.|$|E
25|$|It <b>has</b> <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> that {{a kind of}} anemia, termed thalassemia, has a high {{frequency}} in some Mediterranean populations, including Greeks and southern Italians. The name {{is derived from the}} Greek words for sea (thalassa), meaning the Mediterranean sea, and blood (haima). Vernon Ingram deserves the credit for explaining the genetic basis of different forms of thalassemia as an imbalance in the synthesis of the two polypeptide chains of hemoglobin.|$|E
25|$|Turkey: Polygamy was criminalized in 1926 {{with the}} {{adoption}} of the Turkish Civil Code, part of Atatürk's secularist reforms. Penalties for illegal polygamy are up to 5 years imprisonment. Turkey <b>has</b> <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> for its promotion of secularism, and has introduced measures establishing stricter bars against polygamy; these were passed by the ruling moderate Islamist AK Parti as well. In March 2009, AK Parti effectively banned polygamists from entering or living in the country.|$|E

25|$|AMPK {{also plays}} an {{important}} role in lipid metabolism in the liver. It <b>has</b> <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> that hepatic ACC has been regulated in the liver by phosphorylation. AMPK also phosphorylates and inactivates 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), a key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. HMGR converts 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA, which is made from acetyl-CoA, into mevalonic acid, which then travels down several more metabolic steps to become cholesterol. AMPK, therefore, helps regulate fatty acid oxidation and cholesterol synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Morphine <b>has</b> <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> {{to act on}} receptors {{expressed}} on {{cells of}} {{the central nervous system}} resulting in pain relief and analgesia. In the 1970s and '80s, evidence suggesting that opioid drug addicts show increased risk of infection (such as increased pneumonia, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS) led scientists to believe that morphine may also affect the immune system. This possibility increased interest in the effect of chronic morphine use on the immune system.|$|E
25|$|The {{region is}} divided into three zones – the lowland Baix Penedès, the Penedès central which lies between coastal and inland {{mountain}} ranges, and the upland Alt Penedès. The warmer Baix Penedès, centered on the town of El Vendrell and extending to the Costa Daurada coastline, <b>has</b> <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> for its fortified wines made from Malvasia and Moscatell d'Alexandria (Muscat of Alexandria), but has a growing reputation for non-fortified reds made from Carinyena, Garnatxa and Monastrell.|$|E
50|$|The idea {{of flying}} cars (or roadable aircraft) <b>had</b> <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>known.</b> However, initial work {{centered}} on VTOL vehicles. After {{several years of}} research, market analysis, and customer surveys, the requirements for the FSC-1 were developed.|$|R

25|$|More {{formally}} termed {{socially desirable}} responding (SDR), faking good {{is defined as}} a response pattern in which test-takers systematically represent themselves with an excessive positive bias (Paulhus, 2002). This bias <b>has</b> <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> to contaminate responses on personality inventories (Holtgraves, 2004; McFarland & Ryan, 2000; Peebles & Moore, 1998; Nichols & Greene, 1997; Zerbe & Paulhus, 1987), acting as a mediator of the relationships between self-report measures (Nichols & Greene, 1997; Gangster et al., 1983).|$|E
25|$|Orange County <b>has</b> <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> as a Republican stronghold and has {{consistently}} sent Republican representatives {{to the state}} and federal legislatures. Republican majorities in Orange County helped deliver California's electoral votes to Republican presidential candidates Richard Nixon (1960, 1968 and 1972), Gerald Ford (1976), Ronald Reagan (1980 and 1984) and George H. W. Bush (1988 and 1992). As a measure of how Republican Orange County has historically been, it was one of only five counties in the state that voted for Barry Goldwater in 1964.|$|E
25|$|It <b>has</b> <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> that a lamp-black coating {{will make}} a body nearly black. An {{improvement}} on lamp-black is found in manufactured carbon nanotubes. Nano-porous materials can achieve refractive indices nearly that of vacuum, in one case obtaining average reflectance of 0.045%. In 2009, a team of Japanese scientists created a material called nanoblack which is close to an ideal black body, based on vertically aligned single-walled carbon nanotubes. This absorbs between 98% and 99% of the incoming light in the spectral range from the ultra-violet to the far-infrared regions.|$|E
