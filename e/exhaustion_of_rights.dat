50|$|The parties most {{opposed to}} the grey market are usually the {{authorised}} agents or importers, or the retailers of the item in the target market. Often this is the national subsidiary of the manufacturer, or a related company. In response to the resultant damage to their profits and reputation, manufacturers and their official distribution chain will often seek to restrict the grey market. Such responses can breach competition law, particularly in the European Union. Manufacturers or their licensees often seek to enforce trademark or other intellectual-property laws against the grey market. Such rights may be exercised against the import, sale and/or advertisement of grey imports. In 2002, Levi Strauss, after a 4-year legal case, prevented the UK supermarket Tesco from selling grey market jeans. However, such rights can be limited. Examples of such limitations include the first-sale doctrine in the United States and {{the doctrine of the}} <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> in the European Union.|$|E
40|$|EN) The aim of {{this thesis}} is to provide an {{analysis}} of the principle of <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> especially to computer programs in the comparative context of the legal regulation in the EU and US. The issue of <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> to computer programs became a topical problem after the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in case UsedSoft v. Oracle, when the CJEU ruled that the principle of <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> is applicable not only for sale of computer programs on tangible media such as CD/DVD, but also for distribution of computer programs in digital form via Internet. This decision, however, became widely criticized by legal experts, since CJEU accented rather economic arguments in favor of this principle than the European legal regulations and international conventions. Certain problematic aspects were also demonstrated in the decision of US court in case Capitol Records v. ReDigi, in which the court persuasively summarized legal and technical reasons why the principle of <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> cannot be applicable for the sale of digital files distributed via Internet in the context of current legal regulation.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the legality}} of parallel import of trade-marked goods from a comparative standpoint as the author will examine the legal, judicial and administrative responses to it in three jurisdictions: United States, Canada and the European Union. This issue lies {{at the core of}} the inherent tension between the promotion of free trade and the traditional territorial allocation of intellectual property rights. Parallel import refers to the unauthorized sale of genuine branded products in a given jurisdiction through market channels without the consent of the trade-mark owner in that jurisdiction. The <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> doctrine is one of the most fundamental limitations on intellectual property rights as it provides, in general terms, that once an intellectual property right holder sells an article embodying those rights he no longer has any authority to control the future sale or movement of this article because his right have been exhausted with respect to that article. This inextricable link between parallel imports and the <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> will thus be the focus of our analysis throughout this thesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{theory of}} the <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights,</b> with general {{applicability}} in what concerns the intellectual property rights, implies that the patent holder loses {{a part of his}} prerogatives as an inventor {{as a result of the}} exhaustion of his right,from the moment the object of its patented invention is marketed by him or with his approval. But the approach to the <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> in the Member-States of the European Union has been a danger to the good operation of the single market. However, the regulation, at the Community level, of the <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> theory has solved this difficulty as well. The implementation of patents in the Member-States of the European Union – as long as the novelty conditions of the invention, of an inventive activity, are fulfilled and it is susceptible of having an industrial application – is an acknowledgement of the importance of the research, development and innovation sector at the level of the European Union both from the perspective of the material benefits as well as from that of the acknowledgement and guarantee of the right to renown and reputation of the inventor. The distinction between the three types of patents regulated at the levelof the Member-States of the European Union is made at the level of the legal protection, of the costs and of the possibilities of resolution of disputes that may arise from the exercise of the rights given to the patent beneficiaries. A comparison between the present European patent and the patents in the USA or Japan, from the point of view of costs, makes clear the excessive costs of obtaining a European patent (as high as eight times the cost in Japan, for example). The solution identified by the European legislator was to establish the Community patent. The preservation of the role of the European Patent Office (the same institution involved in the European patenting process) is combined with the accessibility of patenting costs for the patent applicants (especially for small and medium enterprises for whom they are intended), with the establishment of a single, unitary set of procedural rules and with a unitary and compulsory legal interpretation in the entire European Union, meant to lower the cost of the Community patent to half the cost of the European patent. intellectual property rights, development, innovation, {{theory of the}} <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights...</b>|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} the concept of {{parallel}} imports in the Czech law in light of the judicature of the European Court of Justice. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, after a brief introduction to the Czech trademark law, the thesis seeks to define the individual competencies of trademark owners and their restrictions, with an emphasis on the concept <b>of</b> <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rights</b> towards the trademark.

The paper highlights the emerging conflicts between the concept of parallel importation and the differential pricing phenomenon as well as the role of competition policy in addressing the access to medicines conundrum in developing countries. The implication of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement for parallel trade in pharmaceuticals is briefly examined and the paper concludes by arguing that parallel trade is an important mechanism for making medicines available at cheaper rates and governments all over the world should endeavour to put a restraint on adopting measures that would frustrate it...|$|E
40|$|Currently, U. S. {{trademark}} and {{copyright law}} both adopt employ a regime of international <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> {{with respect to}} parallel importation after the Supreme Court ruled in Kirtsaeng last term. This agreement belies {{the fact that these}} two areas of law have developed in nearly divergent directions and have resulted in faltering intellectual property and trade policies. Currently, interpretation of the first sale doctrine hinges on the particular legal characteristics of both trademarks and copyrights. When dealing with trademarks, courts ultimately focus on the source of origin, taking into account consumer expectations or, instead, focusing on the business relationship, if any, between the two parties. With copyrights, courts’ decisions build upon how extensive authors’ rights were intended to be and where an author’s actions can be regulated. In addition to these considerations, however, I propose that U. S. law’s treatment of parallel imports should be informed by the policy concerns at stake. In doing so, courts can and legislators can strike a balance between a national and international exhaustion regime; create compatibility between trademark and copyright law; and effectively eliminate abuse of these discrepancies by parties who can easily disguise their trademark disputes as copyright disputes to bar such imports...|$|E

40|$|The {{historical}} context and {{recent developments in}} Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), the current situation, {{and the way that}} IPR may evolve in the future are explored. This is set against a backcloth of the wide range of existing international treaties, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) agreement on Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) in Uruguay, the establishment of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the moves towards globalisation of economies, and the ramifications of the implementation of TRIPs. A number of challenging scenarios are presented. Recent filing levels, both from home inventors and from abroad, for USPTO, EPO and JPO, are compared and contrasted, for all technologies and for specific "high technology" areas, such as genetic engineering and communications technology.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The World Trade Organization's Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement {{establishes}} {{minimum standards}} for intellectual property rights, including patent protection for pharmaceuticals; therefore, {{it may make}} it difficult for developing countries to gain access to medicines, especially those countries that are the least developed. This study aims to determine whether implementation of the TRIPS Agreement in Latin American and Caribbean countries has generated patent legislation that is sensitive to public health needs. METHODS: Legislation in 11 Latin American and Caribbean countries was analysed. The variables considered in the analysis were: the term of patents issued, patentable subject matter, transition periods (that is, time until legislation was enacted), reversal of the burden of proof of patent infringement, <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights,</b> compulsory licensing and the early working exception (which allows a country to complete all procedures necessary to register a generic product before the original patent expires). FINDINGS: By 2000, all of the countries studied had reformed their legislation to conform to the agreement. Brazil and Argentina used the transition period until 2005 to grant patents in the pharmaceutical industry. All countries, except Panama, made use of the safeguards and flexibilities available through the agreement by including mechanisms for compulsory licensing in their legislation. Argentina; Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela (countries that represented the Andean community); the Dominican Republic; and Panama included mechanisms to allow parallel importation. Mexico did not. Brazil only permits parallel importation after a compulsory licence has been issued. The early working exception is included in legislation in Brazil and the Dominican Republic. CONCLUSION: The countries in this study did not incorporate all of the mechanisms allowed for by the Agreement and are not adequately using the provisions that enable World Trade Organization (WTO) members to obtain better health for the public, particularly in regard to gaining access to medicines. This situation may deteriorate in future if other agreements establish more restrictive rules for intellectual property rights...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the role and}} position of developing countries in the World Trade Organization (WTO) {{in relation to the}} Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). The analysis was done through three case studies involving major developing countries such as Brazil, India and Argentina, major developed country such as the USA and the regional trading bloc, the EC. The case studies identified a number of areas of conflict such as the exemptions under Article 30 of the TRIPS Agreement, compulsory licensing under Article 31 of TRIPS, the <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> after sale of the patented products along with parallel imports, local working, and the role of competition policy to deal with the abuses arising out of patenting monopolies. The case studies were followed by two chapters dealing with attempts to resolve the conflicts through the Dispute Settlement System of the WTO and the Ministerial Conference. The significant developments in this regard have been the WTO Panel Report in Canada-Protection of Pharmaceutical Patents removing object and purpose from interpretations of the TRIPS Agreement, paras 4 and 5 of the Doha Declaration (Ministerial Declaration at Doha dealing with Public Health) restoring object and purpose in interpreting the provisions of the Treaty Agreement as per customary rule of treaty interpretations and the Paragraph 6 solution of 30 th August 2003 introducing export of the patented products as one of the rights under patents. The analysis suggests that developing countries have a limited role to play in such negotiations and interpretations of international treaty such as the TRIPS Agreement and their participation in such negotiations and interpretations is not very effective. The last part of this thesis deals with recommendations and suggests that suitable competition provisions in the legal system of developing countries may prevent or lessen abuses originating from patenting monopolies including issues of parallel trade, discriminatory pricing and non-local working...|$|E
40|$|The author, Director of the Max Planck Institute for International Patent, Copyright and Competition Law in Munich {{considers}} {{the influence of}} full uniformization of the EEC market after 1992 on the protection of industrial property and on free flow of goods within the Community. He pays {{much attention to the}} relations between the internal legal systems regulating the protection of patents, trademarks, designs and copyrights to the law of the Community. Both in the present {{as well as in the}} past — 1992 prospective regulation of the EEC law a departure from the protection granted by internal (national) legal systems seems not only undesirable but also impossible. Much time is needed for common European protection laws to supersede the coexisting protection provided by internal systems. The analysis of particular industrial property rights allows the author to formulate the conclusion that the greatest progress in that respect has been achieved in the EEC patent law; European patents granted on the strength of the Munich Convention of 1973 are much in demand. It should be stressed that the creation by the end of 1992 of uniform internal EEC market is a strong incentive for intensifying the works on the uniformization of industrial property protection. The author also analyses the decisions of the EEC Court with respect to the law on industrial property and free flow of goods on the EEC market, paying special attention to decisions based on Art. 36 of the Treaty of Rome. As to the relation between the principle of free flow of goods and the restrictions resulting from internal systems of industrial property law hitherto existing decisions of the EEC Court will fully remain in force also after 1992. The Court adopted a principle, well known in German law since long, <b>of</b> <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> a <b>right</b> to trademark. This principle allows neither to divide the Common Market by means of national trademarks nor to isolate it from goods produced or reimported from the outside of the Common Market as long as such goods have been provided with a trademark by an authorized person. Circulation restrictions are to maintain arificially high prices for trademarked goods. Towards the end of his article the author points out that there is a danger of changing that situation once the European trademark law comes into force. Recently, under the pressure of industrial lobbies, views have been expressed that this law should regulate only the institution of „European" and not „exterritorial" <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> a <b>right.</b> Such a short-sighted and economically unjustified regulation could lead to the protectionistic isolation of the Community from the rest of the world.

40|$|Contracts lie at {{the heart}} of the {{regulatory}} system governing the creation and dissemination of cultural products in two respects: (i) The exclusive rights provided by copyright law only turn into financial reward, and thus incentives to creators, through a contract with a third party to exploit protected material. (ii) From a user perspective, purchases of protected material may take the form of a licensing contract, governing behaviour after the initial transaction. The renewed interest in the relationship of copyright and contract law can be traced quite precisely to the mid- 1990 s. There was a major technological shift, with the rapid adoption of the WorldWideWeb as a consumer medium (Netscape?s Navigator browser was released in 1994). In parallel, the media and entertainment sector experienced a wave of consolidation, with multinational enterprises keen to hedge their bets in the rapid growth of Internet services (in 2000, AOL merged with Time Warner to create what was then the world?s largest media company). In the new ?private ordering of cyberspace?, contracts played a major part. Not only was there a sudden question mark over who owned the rights to new digital uses of existing works. Changing contractual practices began to cover these new forms of exploitation, and (if permitted by the governing law) unforeseen uses. Creators deride these new practices as ?rights grabbing?; publishers and producers characterise them as ?due diligence?. The digital environment also changed the contractual relationship between buyers and sellers. Traditionally, the producers and distributors of copyright materials were not much concerned about the consumers? after-sale behaviour. General principles relating to trading standards and the sale of goods applied. Once a physical carrier was bought in good order, the relationship to the right owner was severed ? at least in the private sphere. A consumer could read, play, modify, or even copy a work. The purchased book or record could also be sold on under the doctrines of ?first sale? (US), or ?<b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights?</b> (EU). In the digital world, the relationship between buyer and seller may persist after the initial transaction, prescribing conditions of use that have no source in copyright law. This article deals with contracting at the beginning of the value chain, i. e. contracts between creators and intermediaries, the first step in bringing a work to the market. Since the article is based on a study for the UK Strategic Advisory Board for IP Policy (SABIP), the focus is on British and European law, with other jurisdictions consulted primarily to assess the range of possible regulatory options...|$|E

The low-income country chooses whether to enforce an International Patent Regime (strict IPR) or not (weak IPR) and the high-income country chooses whether to allow parallel imports (PI) of on-patent drugs or market based discrimination (MBD).

40|$|In the European Union, {{medicines}} {{are regulated}} products subject to both single market (e. g., regional <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> property <b>rights)</b> and country specific health care regulations (e. g., medicines pricing).

We argue that parallel trade of heavily regulated medicines conflicts with traditional sources of arbitrage (e. g., price and income differences) and instead {{is a form of}} ‘regulatory arbitrage’ that does not produce equivalent welfare effects. We draw upon a unique dataset that contains records of both origin and destination flows of parallel imported medicines to the Netherlands, for one therapeutic group (statins) that accounted for 5 % of the market at the time of study and faced no generic competition. Our findings suggest that after controlling for country of origin (source) effects, parallel trade flows are primarily determined by medicines distribution chain regulation, and not by price differences in line with the hypothesis of ‘regulatory arbitrage’...|$|R
