40|$|Cadmium is an oligoelement {{which is}} not {{essential}} for biological systems but is toxic to most organisms. It is widely distributed in the environment at relatively low concentrations (Dunnick et al. 1988). It is {{not found in the}} free state but accompanies Zn in the majority of its minerals. It is used almost exclusively to form alloys, metal for ball bearings, for soldering, in batteries and <b>electric</b> <b>accumulators</b> and as an anticorrosive. Its resi-dues have contaminated the environment and its presence in sedimentation sludges used to manufacture fertilizers has given rise to an increase in the content of this metal in trophic chains. The inhalation of industrial powders and smoke represents the principal form of occupational exposure. For the general population the major route of exposure is food, because vegetables absorb it from contaminated soil and water. Tobacco is an even more important source, as absorption of inhaled particles ranges from 10 to 60 %, depending on their size and solubility (Nordberg et al. 1985). The literature indicates great variability in the concentrations of this element in foods in different countries, but in general the concentration ranges between 0. 005 - 0. 1 mg/kg wet weight (Friberg et al. 1986). The lowest concentrations in foods are found in milk and dairy products (a few ~g/Kg), followed by meat, fish and fruit, (1 - 50 ~g/Kg), vegetables and cereals (0. 01 - 0. 15 mg/Kg). Liver and kidney of some animals and molluscs can contain higher concentrations (Bermejo et al. 1981; Lopez-Artiguez et al. 1989).

40|$|AbstractMicro-CHP (Combined Heat and Power) {{energy systems}} are {{potentially}} suitable for residential and tertiary utilities, typically characterized by low-grade heat demand and limited electric-to-thermal energy demand ratio values. Different innovative and under development CHP technologies are currently investigated in small scale units, but a standard {{has not been}} identified till now.

The actual convenience of small size CHP systems depends on the demand profiles and the operation management logic.

This article is from Volume 2. The objective of the research is to address the power density issue of electric hybrids and energy density issue of hydraulic hybrids by designing a drive system. The drive system will utilize new enabling technologies such as the INNAS Floating Cup pump/pump motors and the Toshiba Super Charge Ion Batteries (SCiB). The proposed architecture initially included a hydraulic-electric system, where the high power braking power is absorbed by the hydraulic system while energy is slowly transferred from both the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) drive train and the hydraulic drive train to the <b>electric</b> <b>accumulator</b> for storage. Simulations were performed to demonstrate the control method for the hydraulic system with in-hub pump motors. Upon preliminary analysis it is concluded that the electric system alone is sufficient. The final design is an electric system that consists of four in-hub motors. Analysis is performed on the system and MATLAB Simulink is used to simulate the full system. It is concluded that the electric system has no need for a frictional braking system if the Toshiba SCiBs were used. The regenerative braking system will be able to provide an energy saving from 25 % to 30 % under the simulated conditions.

25|$|The main {{inefficiency}} in {{a common}} thermal working machine is the expansion valve, which allows to pass the refrigerant liquid from the low pressure blow pressure without using the potential energy available. This patented and published invention in 2017 by Giuseppe Verde adopts a special technique based on power regeneration for internal cycles, {{in order to reduce}} the consumption of electricity. Innovation is therefore linked to the insertion of a heat exchanger for the recovery of energy and an alternator within a conventional refrigeration system.

Both of these effects increase when the operating temperature and the evaporation temperature decrease. In addition, an advantageous object of the present invention is the insertion of an <b>electric</b> charge <b>accumulator</b> comprising an automatic timed control system for switching off the electric circuit, which guarantees the possibility of economically benefiting the multi-hour tariff electric energy.|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{accumulate}} electric power {{is one of}} the most important and the most developing field in power engineering.

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of a combined heat and power system by means of a fully dynamic numerical approach. An ad-hoc library for the simulation of energy conversion systems is developed under the OpenModelica open source platform; the library includes the main components that usually equip a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system and they can be connected as they are logically connected in the real plant. Each component is modelled by means of equations and correlations that calculate their performance on a time dependent basis. Therefore, many configurations can be evaluated {{not only in terms of}} cumulative annual results or average performance, but the instantaneous behavior can be investigated. The numerical library is constructed using the lumped and distributed parameter approach and it is validated by comparing the numerical results with the measured values over a one-year time period. The prediction capabilities of the proposed numerical approach are evaluated by simulating a case study of a health spa. This case study is selected since it is characterized by significant requirements of both thermal and electric energy. The comparison demonstrated that the calculated results are in good agreement with the measurements in terms of both annual values and distribution over the reference period. Furthermore, an optimization algorithm is adopted and linked to the developed library in order to estimate the best size of different components of the CHP system according to a number of constraints. This feature is particularly important when addressing the energy efficiency of a complete system that is depending on a number of interdependent variables. Therefore, the case study is investigated by accounting also for additional technologies that can be further enhance {{the performance of}} the system both in terms of energy consumption and economic investment. In particular, the numerical model is used to optimized the CHP energy efficiency by estimating the best trade-off between the reduction of the energy purchased and the overall cost of the system. The application of PV panels and <b>electric</b> energy <b>accumulators</b> is also investigated and the simulation demonstrates that the size of the cogeneration unit equal to 48 kW, the number of PV panels of 299 and the battery capacity of 45 kWh provide the lowest amount of energy purchased, while the best return of investment is obtained by the CHP unit of 40 kW along with 109 PV panels and a battery of 40 kWh...|$|R

Trying to keep up with the trend of the future, but also the spirit of Formula Student competition that promotes innovation, the team's 4th racecar is not only the team's first electric-powered racecar, but also the first Formula Student type racecar with an electric motor manufactured in Greece. UoP4e incorporates all knowledge and experience from the three previous UoP Formula Student racecars, namely a carbon fiber monocoque chassis and 10” wheels. The car's highlight is probably the drivetrain/powertrain sub-system. In regards to the transmission, <b>electric</b> motor and <b>accumulator,</b> the team had these three words on their mind during the car's development phase: Functionality - Durability - Lightweight. UoP4e has a more complex geometry than the previous cars, but its ergonomically focused design and increased stiffness give confidence for the construction of a high performance car. A single electric motor, directly driving a differential without the use of a gearbox was promoted for its simplicity, reliability, and ease-of-maintenance. In 2013, UoP4e received an aerodynamics package, something the team had never experimented with up until then. The benefit of a well-developed aerodynamic package was evident early in the development process. In the end, the car turned out to be an amazing performer, being by far the fastest and most successful car of the team so far, finishing in 5th place overall in Formula Student UK electric class and winning the Formula Student Czech Republic competition, setting high targets for the years to come! ...|$|R
