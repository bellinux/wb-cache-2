50|$|Many {{businesses}} in Cincinnati have urged Delta {{to restore the}} service level {{it had in the}} late 1990s and early 2000s while some, such as Chiquita Banana, Toyota, and Veritiv have already relocated to cities with more available flights. The only remaining <b>intercontinental</b> <b>service</b> by Delta is a daily evening departure to Paris. In addition to serving the heavy international travel demand of local companies such as P&G and GE Aviation, the daily Paris flight is also sustained in great part because it ferries jet-engine parts between factories in Cincinnati and France due to GE Aviation's presence. Each year the flight carries 4200000 lb of engine parts. Air France operated flights into CVG for several periods for over a decade before finally terminating the service in 2007.

25|$|Sweden, {{although}} neutral, became {{isolated in}} relation to North America, as all mail had to be sent eastward via the Soviet Union, or westwards via Portugal. The first became impossible after the Soviet Union and Germany went to war on 22 June 1941, and the latter from 7 December when the United States entered the war. The British Royal Air Force started a route from Leuchars, Scotland, to Stockholm, but this was limited to transport of mail and passengers used for the Allied forces. From 1942, Aerotransport introduced mail flights from Stockholm to Scotland, which were relayed onwards to North America. On 10 September 1942, the board of Aerotransport recommended that Sweden start its own <b>intercontinental</b> <b>services.</b> SEK6 million was needed to purchase two four-engine planes; the plans called for the other Nordic flag carriers to join {{after the end of}} the war. The government did not want to threaten the Swedish neutrality, and therefore instructed the state-owned company not to negotiate with an Allied power.
