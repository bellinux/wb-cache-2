40|$|This study {{identifies}} {{the need for}} <b>intercultural</b> business <b>communication</b> competence and contends that a course in this field is of particular relevance to South African organisations. The {{aim of this study}} is to identify, through needs analysis, the specific <b>intercultural</b> business <b>communication</b> requirements of lscor managers with regard to Japan. The requirements are identified in such a way that they may be used as the criteria for an <b>intercultural</b> business <b>communication</b> course. Quantitative and qualitative research methods were used in the study. The results of the research indicate that managers generally lack knowledge of various communication aspects relating to Japan. Participants also indicated a high degree of culture shock in terms of specific intercultural factors. The findings of the study form the content topics around which a course in <b>intercultural</b> business <b>communication</b> may be developed. The relative value of the topics to specific managers is also identified. Communication ScienceM. A. (Communication...|$|R

25|$|An Australian {{case study}} has {{considered}} {{the use of}} process oriented psychology for tackling the problems of <b>intercultural</b> <b>communication</b> in higher education; it finds that Process Work has a multidimensional concept of social rank (expanded beyond social status to include 'psychological' and 'spiritual' aspects) which promotes understanding of interpersonal communication issues and {{could be used to}} improve international student experience in Australia.|$|E
25|$|Emphasizing {{the limits}} of {{approaches}} that focus mainly on institutional answers to ethnic conflicts—which are essentially driven by ethnocultural dynamics of which political and/or economic factors are but elements—Gregory Paul Meyjes urges the use of <b>intercultural</b> <b>communication</b> and cultural-rights based negotiations as tools with which to effectively and sustainably address inter-ethnic strife. Meyjes argues that to fully grasp, preempt, and/or resolve such conflicts—whether {{with or without the}} aid of territorial or non-territorial institutional mechanism(s) -- a cultural rights approach grounded in intercultural knowledge and skill is essential.|$|E

2500|$|The {{cultural}} {{practices of the}} United States show considerable similarities to those in northern and central European regions, such as Germany, Scandinavia, and the United Kingdom. Greeting rituals {{tend to be the}} same in Europe and in the United States, consisting of minimal body contact—often confined to a simple handshake. The main cultural difference in proxemics is that residents of the United States like to keep more open space between themselves and their conversation partners (roughly [...] compared to [...] in Europe). European cultural history has seen a change in personal space since Roman times, along with the boundaries of public and private space. This topic has been explored in A History of Private Life (2001), under the general editorship of Philippe Ariès and Georges Duby. On the other hand, those living in densely populated places likely have lower expectations of personal space. Residents of India or Japan tend to have a smaller personal space than those in the Mongolian steppe, both in regard to home and individual spaces. Different expectations of personal space can lead to difficulties in <b>intercultural</b> <b>communication.</b>|$|E

Indeed, {{as is the case in}} the Renault-Nissan Alliance, the appropriate use of metaphor allowed the firm to bind a diverse group of stakeholders to a common goal by using the inherent ambiguity and multiplicity of meaning of the metaphor to overcome Asian and Western intercultural differences and at the same time maximise goal congruence. <b>intercultural</b> business <b>communication,</b> strategic metaphors, alliance relationships...|$|R
