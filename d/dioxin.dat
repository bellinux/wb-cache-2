40|$|<b>Dioxins</b> in the {{combustion}} gas of Municipal Solid Waste Incinerator(MSWI) are resynthesized during {{passing through the}} lower temperature region between the outlet exhaust boiler and the outlet gas duct. As a countermeasure, a spray water injection method is effective which prevents <b>dioxins</b> from resynthesizing by rapidly cooling down the gas temperature less than the temperature required for resynthesizing of <b>dioxins.</b> Using the evaporation rate of a water droplet calculated by Mizutani’s evaporation theory and the <b>dioxins</b> formation rate estimated by the theory of Altwicker and Stanmore, we have developed Excel program for predicting {{the combustion}} gas cooling rate and <b>dioxins</b> formation rate.

25|$|<b>Dioxins</b> are absorbed {{primarily}} through dietary intake of fat, {{as this is}} where they accumulate in animals and humans. In humans, the highly chlorinated <b>dioxins</b> are stored in fatty tissues and are neither readily metabolized nor excreted.

5|$|Mayerson, with Sgt. Charles E. Hartz {{as their}} {{principal}} client, filed the first US Agent Orange class-action lawsuit, in Pennsylvania in 1980, for the injuries military personnel in Vietnam suffered through exposure to toxic dioxins in the defoliant. Attorney Mayerson co-wrote the brief that certified the Agent Orange Product Liability {{action as a}} class action, the largest ever filed as of its filing. Hartz's deposition {{was one of the}} first ever taken in America, and the first for an Agent Orange trial, for the purpose of preserving testimony at trial, as it was understood that Hartz would not live to see the trial because of a brain tumor that began to develop while he was a member of Tiger Force, Special Forces, and LRRPs in Vietnam. The firm also located and supplied critical research to the Veterans' lead expert, Dr. Codario, including about 100 articles from toxicology journals dating back more than a decade, as well as data about where herbicides had been sprayed, what the effects of <b>dioxin</b> had been on animals and humans, and every accident in factories where herbicides were produced or <b>dioxin</b> was a contaminant of some chemical reaction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarThis report {{describes}} {{the results of}} a WHO-coordinated interlaboratory comparison study on the analysis of <b>dioxins</b> and PCBs in mother's milk and human blood. The study is biannually organised by the WHO, Regional Office for Europe (Copenhagen) and is aiming at the identification of laboratories capable of the analysis of <b>dioxins</b> and related compounds at a good, internationally accepted standard. In the present study, nineteen laboratories from Europe and North- America have participated for <b>dioxins</b> in mother's milk, sixteen for <b>dioxins</b> in blood and ten and sic for the analysis of PCBs in mother's milk and human blood, respectively. The study consisted of the analysis of three different pools of milk and blood, two of which contained added PCDD/Fs. One of the pools was sent after the results of two previous pools have been reported (test for reproducability). Results were evaluated on the basis of statistical analysis in terms of repeatability, reproducibility and accuracy. In general, coefficients of varation (CV) were better for analysis in mother's milk than for the lower levels in blood. Limits for the qualification of methods were average coefficients of variation of < 20 % for analysis of PCBs in milk and blood, < 30 % for <b>dioxins</b> in milk and < 40 % for <b>dioxins</b> in blood. All our four methods have been qualified. In the final ranking of laboratories, RIVM-LOC methods scored first positions for PCBs and <b>dioxins</b> in milk and for PCBs in blood and a third position for the analysis of <b>dioxins</b> in blood. The average CVs were 12. 4, 3. 3, 8. 7 and 11, 3 % for analysis for PCBs and <b>dioxins</b> in milk and blood, respectively...|$|R

5|$|As a white-rot fungus, Panellus stipticus {{contains}} {{enzymes that}} {{are able to}} break down lignin, a complex aromatic polymer in wood that is highly resistant to degradation by conventional enzyme systems. The major enzyme that initiates the cleavage of hydrocarbon rings is laccase, which catalyzes the addition of a hydroxyl group to phenolic compounds (polyphenols). The ring can then be opened between the two adjacent carbon atoms that bear the hydroxyl groups. White-rot fungi are being investigated scientifically for their potential use in the bioremediation of land contaminated by organic pollutants, and to convert industrial wastes rich in toxic polyphenols. Panellus stipticus has been shown to reduce the phenolic concentration of waste water produced by olive-processing plants—an environmental concern in many Mediterranean countries. In this study, a liquid culture of P.stipticus mycelia reduced the initial concentration of phenolic compounds by 42% after a 31-day incubation period. In a separate study, a P.stipticus culture was able to effectively degrade the environmental pollutant 2,7-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, a polychlorinated <b>dioxin.</b>|$|E
