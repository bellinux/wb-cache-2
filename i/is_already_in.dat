5|$|As {{this tournament}} takes {{place during the}} same time period as the NHL's Stanley Cup playoffs, NHL players {{generally}} only become available if their respective NHL team did not make the playoffs, or once they have been eliminated from Stanley Cup contention. It is therefore common for several NHL players to join the World Championships while the tournament <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>in</b> progress.|$|E
5|$|If a chest tube <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>in</b> place, various agents may be instilled {{through the}} tube to achieve {{chemical}} pleurodesis, such as talc, tetracycline, minocycline or doxycycline.

5|$|As of June 2012, {{current issues}} {{do not reflect}} the {{expansion}} of the European Union, as Cyprus is not depicted on current notes as the map does not extend far enough east and Malta is also missing as it does not meet the current series' minimum size for depiction. Since the European Central Bank plans to redesign the notes every seven or eight years after each issue, a second series of banknotes <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>in</b> preparation. New production and anti-counterfeiting techniques will be employed on the new notes, but the design will be of the same theme and colours identical of the current series; bridges and arches. However, they would still be recognisable as a new series.|$|E

5|$|Bond {{investigates the}} murder of a {{motorcycle}} dispatch-rider and the theft of his top-secret documents by a motorcycle-riding assassin. The rider was en route from SHAPE, the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, then located in Versailles, to his base, Station F, in Saint-Germain in France. Since Bond <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>in</b> Paris, his superior, M, sends him to assist in the investigation in any way he can. Bond disguises himself as a dispatch-rider and follows the same journey to Station F as the previous rider: as expected, the assassin attempts to kill Bond. Bond, however, is ready and kills the assassin. He then uncovers the assassin's hidden base of operations.|$|E
5|$|The move 6.Nf3 {{controls}} the e5-square {{in order to}} prepare the push f4–f5. Unlike after 5...Nec6, White {{does not have to}} fear 6...Bc5?!, which encounters difficulties after 7.f5! Nh4 8.Ng5!, when the black knight <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>in</b> danger of being lost to Qd1–g4 or Qd1–h5. Instead Black must react quickly with 6...Bb4+ 7.Nc3 when he can adopt a normal setup with d6/0-0/Nc6/b6 or act boldly with 7...Qf6 threatening both the Nc3 and the f4-pawn. One point in favour of 7...Qf6 is that after 8.e5 Qb6 the black queen prevents White from castling short and is well placed if White castles long.|$|E

Although Sam does not believe him, he accompanies his brother to the djinn's warehouse lair. There Dean discovers that the young woman he has been having visions of {{is a victim of}} the djinn. It's clear that she is alive but in an hallucinatory statea way for the djinn to keep its victims unresisting while it feedsDean realizes that he, too, is within an illusory world. Knowing that a person wakes up if he or she dies in a dream, he decides to kill himself. Carmen, Jessica, and his mother appear and try {{to talk him out of}} it. Dean resists the urge to stay, and awakens in the real world after stabbing himself. Sam, who <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>in</b> the warehouse trying to rescue him, is attacked by the djinn, but Dean kills the creature.|$|E
