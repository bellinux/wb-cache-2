5|$|Ron Swanson {{had been}} {{director}} of Pawnee Parks and Recreation Department {{for six years}} at the time Parks and Recreation began. A staunch Libertarian, with a distinctive mustache, Ron is an extremely strong advocate for small government; despite working in a city hall job, he believes all government {{is a waste of}} taxpayer money. Ron believes the park system should be privatized and run entirely by corporations for profit, as exemplified by the business model of the Chuck E. Cheese's chain of family entertainment centers. He advocates for program cuts wherever possible, and purposely tries to hire people who are bad at their jobs so they will slow <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>government.</b> Ron puts almost no effort into his job, and lets his deputy director Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) do {{the vast majority of the}} work.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the bulk}} of the revolt took place in and around the {{legislature}} over the issue of social credit and government fiscal policy, Aberhart was also under attack on other fronts. He had been invited to attend the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, set for May1937 in London, and planned to go. Douglas, challenged by Hargrave for the leadership of the social credit movement and under attack by some of his own followers for his lack of cooperation with the world's first social credit government, offered to host Aberhart, and a member of Douglas's social credit secretariat was planning a speaking tour for Aberhart. In the same speech in which he threatened to bring <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> on the supply motion, Blue attacked the trip as an extravagance that depression-ridden Alberta could ill afford. Faced with a political insurgency at home, Aberhart reluctantly decided at the end of March to cancel his trip, inaccurately claiming that he had never definitely decided to go.|$|E
5|$|Noriega {{took control}} of most major {{newspapers}} by either buying a controlling stake in them, or by forcing them to shut <b>down.</b> <b>The</b> <b>government</b> also harassed, intimidated, or exiled individual journalists and editors. The newspaper La Prensa, which remained independent and was frequently critical of Noriega, had its staff intimidated and its offices damaged; eventually, it too was forced to close. In May 1984, Noriega allowed the first presidential elections in 16 years. Noriega and Díaz Herrera picked Nicolás Ardito Barletta Vallarino to be the PRD's candidate, {{with the intention of}} keeping him under close control. When the initial results showed Arias, who had the support of much of the opposition, {{on his way to a}} landslide victory, Noriega halted the count. After brazenly manipulating the results, the government announced that Barletta had won by a slim margin of 1,713 votes. Independent estimates suggested that Arias would have won by as many as 50,000 votes had the election been conducted fairly. More than 60,000 votes were not included in the final count. The U.S. government was aware of this manipulation, but chose not to comment on it. Noriega's rule became increasingly repressive, even as the U.S. government of Ronald Reagan began relying on him in its covert efforts to undermine Nicaragua's Sandinista government. The U.S. accepted Barletta's election, and signaled a willingness to cooperate with him, despite recognizing the flaws in the election process.|$|E

25|$|In March 1920 Wolfgang Kapp, {{founder of}} the right wing German Fatherland Party (Deutsche Vaterlands-Partei), tried to bring <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>government.</b> The Berlin {{garrison}} chose his side, and the government buildings were occupied (the government had already left Berlin).

25|$|After prorogation, the Liberals {{underwent}} {{a change in}} leadership and distanced themselves from the coalition agreement, while the NDP and Bloc remained committed to bring <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>government.</b> The Conservative government's budget, unveiled on January 27, 2009, largely met {{the demands of the}} Liberals, who agreed to support it with an amendment to the budget motion.|$|E

25|$|Like many Conservatives Wilson was {{dissatisfied}} at Asquith’s lack of firm {{leadership and}} at the delay in bringing in conscription, and from December 1915 he urged Bonar Law to bring <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> (Law refused, {{pointing out that the}} resulting General Election would be divisive and the support of Radical and Irish MPs would be lost).|$|E

25|$|While Clark's {{government}} would not have survived even with Social Credit support (the motion would still have passed by a single vote if all the Socred MPs voted against it), {{the fact that the}} party abstained on the important budget vote (while the Liberals and NDP voted to bring <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>government)</b> contributed to the perception that the party was no longer relevant. In the 1980 election the Socreds' popular vote fell to 1.7 percent, and it lost its remaining seats.|$|E
50|$|In 1867, the Reconstruction Acts, {{which were}} passed over President Andrew Johnson's veto, {{effectively}} shut <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>governments</b> {{of most of}} the southern states and removed Confederate veterans from elected office.

30|$|The {{cash flow}} from {{operating}} activities {{is equivalent to}} R −[*]E* or B[*]+[*]D.

For any given level of capital expenditure and depreciation, a reduction of B limits the amount of debt <b>the</b> <b>government</b> can pay <b>down.</b>|$|R
50|$|Further, the Aquino {{administration}} {{also sought to}} bring back fiscal discipline in order as it aimed to trim <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>government's</b> budget deficit that ballooned during Marcos' term through privatization of bad government assets and deregulation of many vital industries.

25|$|Clifford {{stated that}} what motivates him {{was much more}} than just money - he said he could not stand {{hypocrisy}} in public life, reserved a particular disgust for lying politicians, and watched with growing anger what he thought happened to the NHS over the past 20 years. For this reason, and because of his working class background, Clifford was a traditional Labour supporter who worked to bring <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> of John Major because he felt that the National Health Service was being mismanaged.|$|E
25|$|In December 1982, the {{dam site}} was {{occupied}} by protesters, leading to widespread arrests and greater publicity. The dispute became a federal issue the following March, when a campaign in the national print media, assisted by the pictures of photographer Peter Dombrovskis, helped bring <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> of Malcolm Fraser at the 1983 election. The new government, under Bob Hawke, had promised to stop the dam from being built. A legal battle between {{the federal government and}} Tasmanian Government followed, resulting in a landmark High Court ruling in the federal government's favour.|$|E
25|$|The trial lasted nine days, {{and in the}} end {{the jury}} threw out Norton's claim, siding with Lord Melbourne. However, the {{resulting}} publicity almost brought <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>government.</b> The scandal eventually died away, but not before Caroline's reputation was ruined and her friendship with Lord Melbourne destroyed. Norton continued to prevent Caroline from seeing her three sons, and blocked her from receiving a divorce. According to English law in 1836, children were the legal property of their father, and there was little Caroline could do to regain custody.|$|E

25|$|In September 1965, major incursions of {{militants and}} Pakistani {{soldiers}} began, hoping {{not only to}} break <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> but incite a sympathetic revolt.

Massive tank battles occurred in the Punjab, and while the Pakistani forces made gains {{in the northern part}} of subcontinent, Indian forces captured the key post at Haji Pir, in Kashmir, and brought the Pakistani city of Lahore under artillery and mortar fire.|$|E
25|$|While the Liberal Party won the by-election, {{there was}} a much higher cost.

These findings were eventually ruled by the Supreme Court of New South Wales as being outside {{the powers of the}} ICAC to make, but by then Premier Greiner and the Minister for the Environment, Tim Moore, had already resigned after the four independents threatened to bring <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> if Greiner stayed in office.
