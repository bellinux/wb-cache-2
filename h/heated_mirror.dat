40|$|Films of {{titanium}} oxynitride {{are assessed}} for their potential as <b>heat</b> <b>mirror</b> coatings oil window glass, {{as a function}} of the film thickness. The coatings are deposited from the atmospheric pressure (AP) chemical vapor reaction of TiCl 4 and ammonia. The <b>heat</b> <b>mirror</b> properties are evaluated using transmission and reflection spectroscopy. The composition of the samples is determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the thickness of the films by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These results suggest that an effective <b>heat</b> <b>mirror</b> can be formed by a 100 nm thick coating of titanium oxynitride, which has a transmission of 49 % in the visible (6 10 nm), and a reflection of 46 % in the near infrared (1320 nm) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Transparent <b>heat</b> <b>mirror</b> {{thin films}} have high {{transmittance}} in the visible range of wavelength and high reflectance {{in the infrared}} range of wavelength. TiO 2 /TiN/TiO 2 films prepared via a D. C reactive magnetron sputtering method on Corning glass and Alkali glass substrates, serve as transparent <b>heat</b> <b>mirrors.</b> The outer TiO 2 layer has both the photo-catalytic and anti-reflective properties. The experiment data showed that the film thickness required for photo-catalytic properties exceeds 350 nm. In this report, we found {{the relationship between the}} thicknesses of the films via calculation and experiment. Prepared films have both catalytic and transparent <b>heat</b> <b>mirror</b> properties with an inner TiO 2 layer thickness of 40 - 300 nm, a sandwich TiN layer thickness of 22 - 35 nm and an outer TiO 2 layer thickness exceeding 350 nm...|$|R

40|$|Optically {{transparent}} <b>heat</b> <b>mirror</b> films, reflective in the infrared, {{have been}} produced based on a dielectric - metal - dielectric design using zinc sulfide and silver coatings. Filters exhibit 87 % peak transmission in the visible region, while reflecting 80 %. in the infrared. Thermal testing indicated the that the layer filters were unstable to treatments above 300 F. Incorporation of thin barrier coatings of magnesium fluoride between the silver and zinc sulfide lavers produced filters with thermal stability to 700 F while retaining optical characteristics of the three laver svstem. These optical and thermal properties offer possible application for the <b>heat</b> <b>mirror</b> films in tungsten source efficiency improvement applications...|$|R

40|$|In {{comparison}} to other noble metals like Au or Cu, Ag {{has a very}} low absorption in the visible wavelength region. Therefore it is used in several types of optical layer stacks e. g. in transparent <b>heat</b> <b>mirrors,</b> solar control layer stacks or transparent electrodes. For several applications the mentioned layer stacks need to be deposited onto a flexible and transparent substrate like a polymer web. Examples are the retrofit or existing glazing units with transparent <b>heat</b> <b>mirrors</b> or the applicationof optical layer stacks onto non-flat surfaces. This paper will present experimental results {{of the influence of}} the process parameters during the deposition on the optical and electrical properties of the Ag layer.

40|$|This study mainly aims to {{evaluate}} the intermixing between layers during the deposition of dielectric/metal/dielectric nanoscale multilayer coatings. TiO(2) and WO(3) films as dielectric materials are developed using radio frequency reactive magnetron sputtering on unheated soda lime glass substrates. Ag films are grown using radio frequency argon sputtering. Auger electron spectroscopy and ultraviolet-visible-near infrared spectrometry are employed to estimate the degree of layer intermixing in TiO(2) /Ag, WO(3) /Ag, TiO(2) /Ag/TiO(2) and WO(3) /Ag/WO(3) films. The morphological properties are also investigated under a field emission scanning electron microscope and an atomic force microscope. The transmittance curves for bilayer films exhibited <b>heat</b> <b>mirror</b> effects significantly. However, multilayer films showed a little amount of <b>heat</b> <b>mirror</b> effects. Auger electron spectroscopy depth profiles confirmed a minor diffusion of Ag at the TiO(2) /Ag interface. However, significant interactions of WO(3) with Ag were observed for the WO(3) /Ag film. Besides, severe intermixing and oxidation of Ag films were observed for the multilayer films...|$|R
