5|$|After scoring touchdowns, Payton {{declined}} to celebrate; instead, he would often hand {{the ball to}} his teammates or the official. He disapproved of the growing practice of touchdown celebrations; he preferred post-game antics such as rushing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> room and locking his teammates {{out in the cold}} while taking a long shower. Although Payton would have won the respect of his peers and coaches by his running alone, he retired as the career leader in receptions for a running back with 492 for over 4,500 yards, and still holds the career record for a running back with 8 touchdown passes.|$|E
5|$|Finn's death hits Beiste hard, {{and when}} Puck comes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> room drunk, {{weeks after the}} funeral and saying that he is lost without Finn, Beiste tells him he needs {{to take charge of}} his life and give himself the advice and {{guidance}} he would have gotten from his best friend. The two cry over their loss. Later, the two gather at Finn's outdoor memorial at McKinley, which includes a tree that Puck had stolen as a memento and later replanted at Beiste's behest, and Puck tells the coach that he has decided to join the Air Force.|$|E
50|$|When Lister is reminiscing {{about the}} good times he had with Rimmer, he recalls them {{breaking}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lockers</b> on Red Dwarf with Rimmer. In this flashback, Rimmer is dressed in blue, signifying his hard-light hologram status. Rimmer was not made a hard-light hologram until they met Legion, after they lost Red Dwarf.

25|$|Miller Freeman became {{inactive}} in October 2010 and was decommissioned on 29 March 2013.

25|$|After Florida State {{scored a}} field goal on their first drive, Auburn responded with a {{touchdown}} {{in the first quarter}} and two in the second to storm out to a 21-3 lead. After a successful punt fake, the Seminoles managed a late touchdown before the half to go <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> room down 21-10, marking the first halftime deficit of the season for the Seminoles.|$|E
50|$|At the gym, Stokely becomes {{suspicious}} of Marybeth during {{a conversation about}} pretending to be what one is not. Marybeth subsequently reveals herself to be the alien queen; earlier on, she faked taking the drug. Casey and Stokely flee to the swimming pool, where Stokely is injured and becomes infected. Zeke catches up with Casey and they hide in <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> room, where <b>the</b> queen knocks Zeke out by hurling him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lockers.</b> She reverts to her Marybeth disguise, now naked, explains that she is taking over Earth because her own planet is dying, and urges Casey to join her. He refuses, seizes the drug, and tricks <b>the</b> queen <b>into</b> following him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> retracting bleachers, trapping her.

He returns to <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> room and finds Stokely and Zeke alive.|$|R

He later met Bischoff there and came to a deal.|$|E
25|$|The Hawkeyes' perfect {{season and}} hopes at a {{national}} championship were in serious jeopardy for three quarters, as Indiana went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> room ahead 21–7 at the half thanks to an opening-drive score and special teams miscues by the Hawkeyes (a 9-yard punt and a fumble on a punt return deep in Iowa territory). The Hoosiers looked to extend the lead to three scores when Tyler Sash somehow managed to intercept a Ben Chappell pass and take it 86 yards the other way for a touchdown.|$|E
25|$|Worth noting in {{a regular}} season meeting between the two rivals in April 2007, a game which the Spurs won 91–86, Tim Duncan {{suffered}} his first career ejection for supposedly laughing while sitting on the bench. Joey Crawford, the referee who ejected Duncan, allegedly asked Duncan to a fight {{which led to the}} longtime ref's season-ending suspension. As Duncan was heading <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> room, American Airlines Center erupted into a huge cheer, applauding Duncan's ejection. The game saw chippy play, with Jerry Stackhouse and Manu Ginóbili getting into an altercation after a rebound.|$|E

50|$|In 1964, further {{expansions}} were contracted at a {{total cost}} of $1,667,000. This provided {{for the construction of}} the Roundhouse, home to the indoor sporting venues. On the lower level, a new swimming pool and boys' locker room were constructed. The old swimming pool was converted to classroom space, but the old gymnasiums are still in use. <b>The</b> old <b>locker</b> rooms were remodeled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> girls' <b>locker</b> rooms.|$|R
25|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1985–86 season, the Celtics made a daring trade for Bill Walton, an All-Star center with a history of injury. The risk paid off; Walton's {{acquisition}} helped Boston win a league best 67 games. One of Bird's career highlights occurred at the 1986 NBA All-Star Weekend when he walked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> room at the inaugural Three-Point Shootout and asked who was going to finish second before winning the shootout. With averages of 25.8 points, 9.8 rebounds, and 6.8 assists, and 2 steals per game, Bird became just the third player in NBA history to win three consecutive MVP Awards. In the playoffs, the Celtics lost only one game through the first three rounds en route to a match-up against the Rockets in the Finals. Bird averaged 24 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 9.5 assists per game for the championship round, leading Boston to victory in six games. The '86 Celtics are commonly ranked {{as one of the greatest}} basketball teams of all-time, with the Boston Globes Peter May and Grantland's Bill Simmons listing them at number one.|$|E
25|$|Robin is {{devastated by}} her cousin Georgie's (Lindze Letherman) death in December 2007. After Georgie's funeral and Maxie's (Kirsten Storms) horrible {{outburst}} at Felicia (Kristina Wagner), she seeks comfort in Patrick's arms, because he truly knows her and sees {{her as she}} truly is, and tells him {{that it is not}} about getting back together, or a baby or even sex, but that she just wants him to hold her. Caught in a moment, they end up making love. That night, a condom breaks and Robin becomes pregnant, although she is unaware of this until weeks later. Dr. Kelly Lee tells Robin that the date of conception would have to be sometime around Christmas, which was around the time when Patrick and Robin had sex. Robin, worried that Patrick now has HIV, is about to tell him, but when she walks <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> room she hears Dr. Julian tell Patrick that the HIV test he took (after he realizes that the condom had broken when he and Robin had sex) has come back negative. With the news that Patrick is not infected, Robin makes up her mind not to tell Patrick about the pregnancy just yet. Robin later blurts out to Patrick that she is pregnant, but leaves out {{the fact that he is}} the father. She tells him that she went to a sperm bank and that she does not know who her baby's father is. Although he thinks she is having a baby with someone else, Patrick cannot stay away from Robin or her child. After several occurrences, Patrick slowly realizes that he may in fact be the father of her baby. After they have a heart to heart, however, and Patrick asks about the paternity of the baby. Robin admits he is the father. But even though she is pregnant, Robin cannot let go of the fact that he never wanted children. Arguments and resentment builds from both sides- Patrick wanting to be a part of his child's life, Robin telling him it's her baby that he never wanted. Eventually, being confronted by her past—remembering how wrong she believed Carly was to keep baby Michael's paternity from AJ (Billy Warlock), or even her own mother keeping her away from her father the first 6 years of her life—Patrick and Robin forgave one another and started the movement up again in their own relationship. Over time, Patrick and Robin grow even closer and Patrick falls even more in love with Robin, and with the child he never wanted.|$|E
500|$|New Yorker and {{dedicated}} New York Mets fan, Mike Massimino, brought the home plate from Shea Stadium {{along on the}} mission. [...] He was forced to slightly alter the plate {{to allow it to}} fit <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> designated for memorabilia. Massimino presented the plate back to the Mets management upon return and threw out the first pitch there. [...] The plate is now on display at Citi Field.|$|E
50|$|Coming <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{game with}} Auburn, Georgia's program {{seemed to be}} in shambles. It had lost four of its last five games, {{including}} rare losses to Vanderbilt and Kentucky. Georgia set the tone on their opening drive when Matthew Stafford found A.J. Bryant for a 53-yard gain down to the Auburn 8 yard line. Kregg Lumpkin took it in from there, and Georgia never looked back. Georgia seemed to reverse all of its ill fortunes in an explosive second quarter that saw them score 23 points and take a 30-7 lead <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lockers</b> at halftime. <b>The</b> second quarter featured contributions from both the offense and the defense: a 30-yard interception return for a touchdown by Tra Battle, a one-yard touchdown run by Brannan Southerland, a 14-yard touchdown pass from Stafford to Kregg Lumpkin and a 34-yard field goal by Gordon Ely-Kelso.|$|R

500|$|Elden Auker (McMillin's all-conference quarterback at Kansas State) {{wrote in}} his book, Sleeper Cars and Flannel Uniforms, [...] "McMillin was a great psychologist. He really knew how to give us talks that fired us up ... The normal routine for McMillin was to bring us out onto the field to loosen up and then take us back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> room for a pep talk. By {{the time he was}} through talking, we {{believed}} we could take on the world".|$|E
500|$|Buffy, Willow, Jesse McNally (Eric Balfour), and Xander meet {{during a}} break, and Xander returns the stake. Buffy claims it is {{standard}} self-defense in Los Angeles. Cordelia appears and tells Buffy that gym is cancelled {{due to the}} [...] "extreme dead guy" [...] in one student's gym locker. Buffy asks whether there were marks on the body, freaking out Cordelia. Buffy forces her way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> room, examines the body, and finds the characteristic puncture wounds of a vampire on the neck. Buffy returns {{to the library and}} confronts Giles, who informs her that he is her Watcher. Buffy refuses to accept her calling as a Slayer, since it had gotten her kicked out of her previous school and robbed her of a social life. After they leave the library, Xander emerges from behind the shelves, having overheard the strange conversation.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Phil Klemmer and John Enbom and {{directed}} by Harry Winer, marking both Klemmer and Enbom's eleventh writing credit, and Winer's third directing credit for the series. Klemmer and Enbom initially thought {{that they would be}} unable to write the episode because they didn't know very much about American football—so they tried to make the episode less about football. Enbom stated, [...] "Rob just sort of handed [...] down. I think if you play strict attention, you'll find it isn't as footbally as an episode about a football player could possibly be. And I think that's why." [...] The episode did not have the budget to hire a full football team, so several scenes were devoid of extras, including when Veronica meets one of the football players and when she breaks <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> room.|$|E

2500|$|During the mid-1980s, Strom had {{a couple}} {{incidents}} with team personnel being in <b>the</b> referees' <b>locker</b> room, which was against league rules. In 1985, Dallas Mavericks owner Don Carter entered <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> room and accused Strom of having a vendetta against Dick Motta, coach of the Mavericks. The next year during the 1986 NBA Playoffs game between the Atlanta Hawks and Boston Celtics at Boston Garden in Boston, Massachusetts, Hawks coach Mike Fratello was attacked by a fan. [...] Fratello walked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> officials <b>locker</b> room and reported the incident to Strom. Strom eventually was fined and worked a couple more playoff games that year.|$|R
50|$|On July 15, , Phillips was {{the plate}} umpire {{when he decided}} to take Albert Belle's bat and have it placed in <b>the</b> umpire's <b>locker</b> room, after Chicago White Sox manager Gene Lamont alleged that the bat was corked. As the Indians were aware that Belle's bat was corked, Cleveland pitcher Jason Grimsley managed to get <b>into</b> <b>the</b> umpire's <b>locker</b> room and put a {{different}} bat in place of Belle's. However, the trick did not work as the new bat had Paul Sorrento's name on it, and Belle received a seven-game suspension.|$|R
500|$|Tomjanovich {{was able}} to get up and walk around, however, and on the way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> room he saw Washington. Tomjanovich says that he became {{aggressive}} and asked Washington why he punched him. Washington yelled something inaudible about Kunnert, and they were broken up by two security personnel. Tomjanovich was in no condition to fight despite his aggressiveness; besides having the bone structure of his face detached from his skull and suffering a cerebral concussion and broken jaw and nose, he was leaking blood and spinal fluid into his skull capsule. His skull was fractured {{in such a way that}} Tomjanovich could taste the spinal fluid leaking into his mouth. He later recalled that at the time of the incident, he believed the scoreboard had fallen on him. The doctor who worked on Tomjanovich said [...] "I have seen many people with far less serious injuries not make it" [...] and likened the surgery to Scotch-taping together a badly shattered eggshell.|$|E
500|$|Later, Youkilis {{was swept}} up in the team's ritual annual hazing, in which he and other rookies were made to wear skimpy Hooters {{waitress}} outfits, orange satin shorts and tight, clingy white tank tops, for the team trip from Canada through US Customs in Florida. [...] "I walked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> room, and all my clothes were gone", Youkilis said. [...] "There was just a Hooters outfit and shoes." [...] Youkilis was named the American League (AL) Rookie of the Month for May, after leading AL rookies with nine walks and a [...]446 OBP as he batted [...]318 with 7 RBIs, and 15 runs in 13 games. Noting ways that his life had suddenly changed, he said: [...] "I'm staying in the best hotel I've ever stayed in, and my paycheck has quadrupled." [...] In mid-July he was sent back down to AAA, however, to make room for Ramiro Mendoza, though he was brought up again {{towards the end of the}} season.|$|E
500|$|The Tide {{went ahead}} in the second quarter. [...] Greg McElroy threw for only 58 yards on 6 of 11 passing for Alabama, but 23 of those yards came on a {{completion}} to Julio Jones that advanced {{the ball to the}} Texas 12. [...] Three plays later Mark Ingram ran it in from two yards out, and Alabama went ahead 7–6. [...] After an exchange of punts, Bama took possession on the Texas 49-yard line, and on the second play Trent Richardson burst {{through a hole in the}} middle and raced 49 yards untouched for the touchdown, extending the lead to 14–6. [...] Texas continued to struggle for offense in McCoy's absence, and on the next possession a Texas drive ended when Javier Arenas intercepted a Gilbert pass at the Alabama 25. [...] Following a short punt late in the quarter, Bama drove to the Texas 9, and increased their lead to 17–6 following a successful 26-yard Leigh Tiffin field goal. [...] It appeared that the Crimson Tide would go <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> room leading 17–6. [...] However, after gaining nine yards on a rush up the middle, Texas called time out with 15 seconds left. With the ball at the Texas 37, Gilbert threw a shovel pass to D.J. Monroe, who bobbled the ball and batted it into the arms of Alabama defensive lineman Marcell Dareus, who lumbered 28 yards for a touchdown that made the halftime score 24–6.|$|E
50|$|In the second, Flacco again found Boldin, {{this time}} from 31 yards away, to even the scoring again at 14-all. On Washington's ensuing possession, Alfred Morris fumbled, Baltimore recovered, and Flacco found tight end Dennis Pitta from 19 yards out for his 3rd TD pass of the half, and <b>the</b> Ravens went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> halftime <b>locker</b> room with a 21-14 edge as Washington could not answer in the quarter.|$|R
