50|$|Rolling-element {{bearings}} {{are widely}} used in the industries today, and hence maintenance of these bearings becomes an important task for the maintenance professionals. The rolling-element bearings wear out easily due to metal-to-metal contact, which creates faults in the outer race, <b>inner</b> <b>race</b> and ball. It {{is also the most}} vulnerable component of a machine because it is often under high load and high running speed conditions. Regular diagnostics of rolling-element bearing faults is critical for industrial safety and operations of the machines along with reducing the maintenance costs or avoiding shutdown time.

50|$|A spherical rolling joint is a high-precision {{ball joint}} {{consisting}} of a spherical outer and <b>inner</b> <b>race</b> separated by ball bearings. The ball bearings are housed in a spherical retainer and roll along both {{the inner and outer}} surfaces.

SRJs are often used in parallel robotics applications like a Stewart platform, where high rigidity and low backlash are essential.|$|E
50|$|The outer {{universal}} joint allows greater angular changes but not changes in shaft length. It is normally {{a ball and}} cage type with an <b>inner</b> <b>race</b> splined to the intermediate shaft. An outer race is formed in the yoke.

40|$|Bearing {{damage in}} modern inverter-fed AC drive systems {{is more common}} than in motors working with 50 or 60 Hz power supply. Fast {{switching}} transients and common mode voltage generated by a PWM inverter cause unwanted shaft voltage and resultant bearing currents. Parasitic capacitive coupling creates a path to discharge current in rotors and bearings. In order to analyze bearing current discharges and their effect on bearing damage under different conditions, calculation of the capacitive coupling between the outer and <b>inner</b> <b>races</b> is needed. During motor operation, the distances between the balls and races may change the capacitance values. Due to changing of the thickness and spatial distribution of the lubricating grease, this capacitance {{does not have a}} constant value and is known to change with speed and load. Thus, the resultant electric field between the races and balls varies with motor speed. The lubricating grease in the ball bearing cannot withstand high voltages and a short circuit through the lubricated grease can occur. At low speeds, because of gravity, balls and shaft voltage may shift down and the system (ball positions and shaft) will be asymmetric. In this study, two different asymmetric cases (asymmetric ball position, asymmetric shaft position) are analyzed and the results are compared with the symmetric case. The objective {{of this paper is to}} calculate the capacitive coupling and electric fields between the outer and <b>inner</b> <b>races</b> and the balls at different motor speeds in symmetrical and asymmetrical shaft and balls positions. The analysis is carried out using finite element simulations to determine the conditions which will increase the probability of high rates of bearing failure due to current discharges through the balls and races. ...|$|R

50|$|Two {{bearings}} {{are used}} per wheel. The bearings slip into openings molded into {{each side of}} the wheel hub, and a flange molded into the wheel hub holds the bearings the correct distance apart. Additionally there is an axle spacer either machined into the axle or that slides over the axle (depending on the axle system used). Since the outer race of the bearing contacts the wheel spacer and the <b>inner</b> <b>race</b> of the bearing contacts the axle spacer, it is critical that the relationship between these two spacers is correct. If the wheel spacer is wider than the axle spacer the bearings will bind when the axle bolt (or bolts) are tightened.|$|E
50|$|THM400 {{transmissions}} {{are very}} popular in automotive competition due to their great strength. Much of this strength comes {{from the use of}} a cast iron center support to suspend the transmission's concentric shafts that join the clutch assemblies to the gear train. The center support, which is splined to the interior of the transmission's case, also provides a robust reaction point for first gear (the gear train's reaction carrier is restrained from counter-rotating the engine in first gear by a roller clutch whose <b>inner</b> <b>race</b> is part of the center support). Since the first gear reactive force is evenly distributed around the periphery of the case, the types of mechanical (and some times violent) failures that have plagued other competition transmissions are rare.|$|E
5000|$|An {{angular contact}} ball bearing uses axially {{asymmetric}} races. An axial load passes {{in a straight}} line through the bearing, whereas a radial load takes an oblique path that tends to want to separate the races axially. So the angle of contact on the <b>inner</b> <b>race</b> is the same as that on the outer race. Angular contact bearings better support [...] "combined loads" [...] (loading in both the radial and axial directions) and the contact angle of the bearing should be matched to the relative proportions of each. The larger the contact angle (typically in the range 10 to 45 degrees), the higher the axial load supported, but the lower the radial load. In high speed applications, such as turbines, jet engines, and dentistry equipment, the centrifugal forces generated by the balls changes the contact angle at the inner and outer race. Ceramics such as silicon nitride are now regularly used in such applications due to their low density (40% of steel). These materials significantly reduce centrifugal force and function well in high temperature environments. They also tend to wear in a similar way to bearing steel—rather than cracking or shattering like glass or porcelain.|$|E

Besides making it virtually impossible to walk through the - at times more than 50 cm deep - mud on the camping sites and {{on the way to the}} stages, almost all cars had to be towed to the road by tractors on departure, because they could not move on the parking sites that were exclusively on grassland. Furthermore, the rain was the final reason why a bridge connecting the <b>inner</b> <b>race</b> track (where the main stage is) with the outer race track (where the camping sites are accessible from) collapsed on the evening of the second day. 31 people were injured, although none seriously, but a panic could be averted, mainly thanks to the coincidence that the Red Cross tent was very close to the bridge. The organisers very quickly secured and illuminated the area and arranged pathways for ambulances to come in and pick up the injured. Despite harsh criticism, it later turned out the organisers were not directly guilty of the event. They had hired a construction company that built the fundament of materials not suitable for outdoor use, unlike what had been agreed on. Pioneers of the Federal Armed Forces of Austria (the Bundesheer) constructed a replacement bridge out of aluminium and steel that very night, so that it could be used on the remaining, third day.|$|E

40|$|In rocket engines {{power is}} usually {{obtained}} by burning fuel and oxidizer which are mixed, pressurized, and directed to a combustion chamber {{by means of}} turbopumps. Roller bearings are generally used in these turbopumps, but because of bearing demands hydrostatic bearings were proposed.

A disadvantage of such proposals is that during startup, acceleration, and shutdown high pressure fluids are not available for hydrostatic bearings. The fluid lubrication film is not always present in bearings of turbopumps. During these periods a second bearing is required to carry the load.

40|$|The {{development}} of a tool called the Service Load Factor (SLF) for railway tapered roller bearings using residual stress and retained austenite data is presented. Case-carburized tapered roller bearings used in the railroad industry are manufactured with a dual-phase microstructure that consists primarily of tempered martensite and retained austenite. The retained austenite phase is metastable, and will transform to martensite with sufficient thermal or mechanical energy during service. The increase in surface volume because of transformation, and the subsequent increase in compressive residual stress could indicate the onset of certain failure modes, including fatigue spalling. In addition, retained austenite transformation can {{lead to an increase}} in bore diameter, which could result in a loss of fit on the axle journal. Several bearing <b>inner</b> <b>races</b> with various service histories were measured with a Siemens X-ray diffractometer using chromium radiation.
