500|$|On May 18, Gilmore {{appeared}} on the MSNBC program Tucker, hosted by Tucker Carlson. When alerted {{about the situation in}} Iraq, Gilmore made the assessment that when Iraq was invaded the president probably did not think American troops would be trying to control the streets in Baghdad at this point. He stated that it <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> Americans to remain in Iraq and be involved in the [...] "Middle East issue" [...] because if not, America is [...] "going to end up with a major war". Later in the interview when Gilmore was asked if he believed Attorney General Alberto Gonzales was credible, he stated, [...] "No, I don’t think he is particularly credible". On May 27, Gilmore {{appeared on}} ABC's This Week and continued the strategy of attacking his opponents in the race for president. On the show, he criticized the credentials of former Senator and potential candidate Fred Thompson of Tennessee. He reminded the audience that Thompson is [...] "a one-term senator" [...] and that [...] "he's well known because of his Law & Order appearance. But the question is, is there a solid, consistent record there of supporting conservative principles?" ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Karl Marx, {{the father}} of [...] "scientific socialism", {{religion}} is a tool used by the ruling classes whereby the masses can shortly relieve their suffering via the act of experiencing religious emotions. It <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> the ruling classes to instill in the masses the religious conviction that their current suffering will lead to eventual happiness. Therefore, {{as long as the}} public believes in religion, they will not attempt to make any genuine effort to understand and overcome the real source of their suffering, which in Marx's opinion was their capitalist economic system. In this perspective, Marx saw religion as escapism.|$|E
2500|$|The use {{of union}} data would {{probably}} prevail regardless of assumptions, since {{the data are}} collected through voluntary surveys. Since the responses are provided voluntarily, and since the response requires {{a substantial amount of}} work to understand and complete, it <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> employers with high wage workforces and high overhead to respond. By answering the request for data when employers with lower wage workforces and low overhead do not, they pull the prevailing wage determination in their favor. For smaller employers and employers who do not participate in federal contracting, it is not worth the cost to complete the surveys. Furthermore, it <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> local unions to respond to the surveys, since a predetermination of wage significantly below the union wage would allow non-union employers to bid successfully on contracts. Thus, the survey responses tend to be biased upwards towards collective bargaining agreement wage levels. This source of bias was noted in the DOL Office of the Inspector General report: “A past audit observed that the methods used by WH to obtain survey data allowed bias to be introduced into wage surveys. Statistical sampling of employers was not done. Only data from employers and third parties who volunteered to participate in the surveys were considered. Consequently, data that could have influenced survey results may have been omitted. Also, employers and third parties who may have had a stake in the outcome of wage decisions were afforded an opportunity to submit erroneous data that may have influenced the survey results.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Some traumatized {{people may}} feel {{permanently}} damaged when trauma symptoms {{do not go}} away {{and they do not}} believe their situation will improve. This can lead to feelings of despair, transient paranoid ideation, [...] loss of self-esteem, profound emptiness, suicidality, and frequently depression. If important aspects of the person's self and world understanding have been violated, the person may call their own identity into question. [...] Often despite their best efforts, traumatized parents may have difficulty assisting their child with emotion regulation, attribution of meaning, and containment of post-traumatic fear {{in the wake of the}} child's traumatization, leading to adverse consequences for the child. In such instances, it <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> the parent(s) and child for the parent(s) to seek consultation as well as to have their child receive appropriate mental health services.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1871 Paul Draneht, {{the general}} manager of the Cairo Opera, {{negotiated}} with Sasse about the possibility of appearing as Amneris in the world premiere of Verdi's new opera Aida which was to be performed in Cairo later that year. He wrote about this to Verdi, who then wrote to Giovanni Battista Lampugnani, the theatrical agent in Milan: [...] "I have no use for her – either as Amneris, who is a mezzo-soprano, or as Aida, for other reasons." [...] Draneht visited Verdi at his home in Sant' Agata in May, where they discussed her further. Draneht, having been unaware of Verdi's opposition, had already signed her to sing Amneris. Verdi was adamantly opposed, not only because the part was too low, but because [...] "I know from experience that it <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> both the management and the composer to give her operas in which she is the only soprano, or at least an opera which has no other role equal or superior to hers." ...|$|E

She is the third Israeli leader to receive this honor after Shimon Peres and Moshe Dayan. The list also includes former U.S. Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. Livni referred to the Goldstone Report accusing Israel of committing war crimes in Gaza, and {{said there was a}} huge ethical gap between those seeking to murder children in their homes and those unintentionally harming civilians used by terrorists as human shields. Referring to the Israeli shelling of several UN schools in Gaza where thousands of civilians were taking shelter during the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict, Livni insisted that she [...] "regret(s) every civilian casualty, but what happened at the UN school was not a mistake." [...] Addressing the peace process, Livni said Israel is not involved in it as a favor to anyone, but that it <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> all parties. At her next stop in Miami, Livni became the first Israeli woman to receive the International Hall of Fame Award from the International Women's Forum.|$|E

2500|$|In December 1948 Sal {{is celebrating}} Christmas with his {{relatives}} in Testament, Virginia, when Dean shows up with Marylou (having left his second wife, Camille, and their newborn baby, Amy, in San Francisco) and Ed Dunkel. Sal's Christmas plans are shattered as [...] "now the bug was on me again, and the bug's name was Dean Moriarty." [...] First they drive to New York, where they meet Carlo and party. Dean wants Sal {{to make love}} to Marylou, but Sal declines. In Dean's Hudson they take off from New York in January 1949 and make it to New Orleans. In Algiers they stay with the morphine-addicted Old Bull Lee and his wife Jane. Galatea Dunkel joins her husband in New Orleans while Sal, Dean, and Marylou continue their trip. Once in San Francisco, Dean again leaves Marylou to be with Camille. [...] "Dean will leave you out in the cold anytime it <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> him," [...] Marylou tells Sal. Both of them stay briefly in a hotel, but soon she moves out, following a nightclub owner. Sal is alone and on Market Street has visions of past lives, birth, and rebirth. Dean finds him and invites him to stay with his family. Together, they visit nightclubs and listen to Slim Gaillard and other jazz musicians. The stay ends on a sour note: [...] "what I accomplished by coming to Frisco I don't know," [...] and Sal departs, taking the bus back to New York.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the midst}} of the European sovereign-debt crisis, Radek Sikorski, Poland's Foreign Minister, stated in November 2011, [...] "I will {{probably}} be the first Polish foreign minister in history to say so, but here it is: I fear German power less than I am beginning to fear German inactivity. You have become Europe's indispensable nation." [...] According to Jacob Heilbrunn, a senior editor at The National Interest, such a statement is unprecedented when taking into consideration Germany's history. [...] "This was an extraordinary statement from a top official of a nation that was ravaged by Germany during World War II. And it reflects a profound shift taking place throughout Germany and Europe about Berlin's position {{at the center of the}} Continent." [...] Heilbrunn believes that the adage, [...] "what was good for Germany was bad for the European Union" [...] has been supplanted by a new mentality—what <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> Germany is also in the interest of its neighbors. The evolution in Germany's national identity stems from focusing less on its Nazi past and more on its Prussian history, which many Germans believe was betrayed—and not represented—by Nazism. The evolution is further precipitated by Germany's conspicuous position as Europe's strongest economy. Indeed, this German sphere of influence has been welcomed by the countries that border it, as demonstrated by Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski's effusive praise for his country's western neighbor. This shift in thinking is boosted by a newer generation of Germans who see World War II as a distant memory.|$|E
2500|$|While nominating for the Peace Nobel Prize, the nominator {{in a short}} biography, gave Singh’s {{status as}} follows: Singh [...] "is {{the editor of the}} World Federation and an {{unofficial}} envoy of Afghanistan. The nominator wrote a short biography as well as international political activities. Particularly his role in the Indo-Turco-German mission was highlighted. For instance, Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany and Sultan Mohemmod Rishad of Turkey gave him letters for the Afghan King. He arrived in Kabul on Oct. 2, 1915. On December 1, 1915, a Provisional Government for India was organised. Pratap was declared as its President. In 1917 he went to Russia and met Trotsky at Leningrad. From there he came back to meet Kaiser and Sultan, to give the message of the King of Afghanistan. He passed some time in Budapest and Switzerland. He was brought by German aeroplane to Russia, where he met Lenin. From there he went to Afghanistan. King Amanullah sent him on a mission to China, Tibet, Japan, Siam, Germany, Turkey and the U.S.A. After an agreement with the British, the King lost interest in Pratap. In the end, it is summarized: “He is primarily on an unofficial economic mission of Afghanistan. However, being born as an Indian he also wanted to expose the British brutalities in that land of the idealist Americans. At this juncture, when the great freedom movement of India is developing with large momentum it <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> the spiritually minded as well as business people to study carefully this new phenomenon of our social life. …. He hopes to achieve some practical results in this direction during his present sojourn in this country (U.S.A.). He is planning to establish an Afghanistan information bureau and an office of the World Federation at Washington, D.C. He just tries to do his duty according to his best understanding and leaves the working of fate to the Laws of Nature!" ...|$|E

Tell me not of your engagements and promises to another: your promises were sins of inconsideration, at best; and you are bound to repent and annul them. That gentleman, although with good reputation, is already engaged on the other side.
