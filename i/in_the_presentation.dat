5|$|The {{most famous}} tragedies of Sophocles feature Oedipus and also Antigone: they are {{generally}} known as the Theban plays, although each play was actually {{a part of a}} different tetralogy, the other members of which are now lost. Sophocles influenced the development of drama, most importantly by adding a third actor, thereby reducing the importance of the chorus <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>presentation</b> of the plot. He also developed his characters {{to a greater extent than}} earlier playwrights such as Aeschylus.|$|E

5|$|Soon after {{publishing}} the special {{theory of relativity}} in 1905, Einstein started {{thinking about how to}} incorporate gravity into his new relativistic framework. In 1907, beginning with a simple thought experiment involving an observer in free fall, he embarked on what would be an eight-year search for a relativistic theory of gravity. After numerous detours and false starts, his work culminated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>presentation</b> to the Prussian Academy of Science in November 1915 of what are now known as the Einstein field equations. These equations specify how the geometry of space and time is influenced by whatever matter and radiation are present, and form the core of Einstein's general theory of relativity.|$|E
5|$|The aim of cognition-oriented treatments, {{which include}} reality {{orientation}} and cognitive retraining, is {{the reduction of}} cognitive deficits. Reality orientation consists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>presentation</b> of information about time, place or person to ease {{the understanding of the}} person about its surroundings and his or her place in them. On the other hand, cognitive retraining tries to improve impaired capacities by exercitation of mental abilities. Both have shown some efficacy improving cognitive capacities, although in some studies these effects were transient and negative effects, such as frustration, have also been reported.|$|E

5|$|Trevor Munson {{conceived}} {{the character of}} Mick Angel in 2004 and spent {{two and a half}} years writing a novel featuring the character. The story was adapted into a feature film script, and Bruce Willis was considered as a possibility for the lead role. The script was shown to Nina Tassler at CBS, who paired Munson with Ron Koslow, creator of Beauty and the Beast, to rewrite the script as a television series. The series was titled Twilight, and Koslow and Munson wrote the pilot, which Warner Bros. Television initially commissioned as a presentation lasting 14–20 minutes in January 2007. Joel Silver and Gerard Bocaccio were hired to be executive producers on the project under the former's production banner, Silver Pictures, in the same month. Alex O'Loughlin and Shannon Lucio were cast <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>presentation,</b> and Rod Holcomb was hired as director. The project was renamed Moonlight when picked up by CBS on May 14, 2007, prior the upfronts. David Greenwalt, creator of Miracles and co-creator of Angel, joined the staff in May 2007 as showrunner and executive producer alongside Silver. CBS had hired Greenwalt during the pilot process to restructure the original concept by Koslow and Munson, but health reasons forced Greenwalt to leave the series, and Chip Johannessen took over showrunner duties in August 2007.|$|E
