When {{the title}} was {{shortened}} to just HG, many longtime subscribers thought they were getting a new magazine and put <b>it</b> <b>aside</b> {{for the real thing}} to arrive. Most of those subscriptions were eventually canceled, and while some fashion advertisers came over, most of the magazine's traditional advertisers pulled out.|$|E
5|$|Madonna: An Intimate Biography {{is a book}} by American author J. Randy Taraborrelli, {{chronicling the}} life of American singer Madonna. The book was {{released}} in April 2001 by Sidgwick & Jackson in the United Kingdom, and in August 2001 by Simon & Schuster in the United States. Taraborrelli first considered writing the book in 1990, but, realizing the project might be premature in respect to Madonna's fledgling career, set <b>it</b> <b>aside.</b> He began writing the book in 1996, when Madonna {{gave birth to her}} daughter Lourdes.|$|E
5|$|Graveyard Mountain Home is {{the third}} studio album {{released}} under the name Chroma Key by American keyboardist Kevin Moore. It was released on November 8, 2004 by InsideOut Music. Moore originally started work on the album in 2003, planning to release a less electronica-influenced album than previous Chroma Key albums, but put <b>it</b> <b>aside</b> {{to work on the}} first OSI album. He then moved to Istanbul, Turkey, where he wrote Ghost Book, the soundtrack to the film Okul. Enjoying the experience of writing music to film, Moore scrapped his previous plans for the third Chroma Key album, instead writing an album as an alternate soundtrack to an already-existing film.|$|E

5|$|Maria Deraismes was {{initiated}} into Freemasonry in 1882, then resigned {{to allow her}} lodge to rejoin their Grand Lodge. Having failed to achieve acceptance from any masonic governing body, she and Georges Martin started a mixed masonic lodge that actually worked masonic ritual. Annie Besant spread the phenomenon to the English speaking world. Disagreements over ritual {{led to the formation}} of exclusively female bodies of Freemasons in England, which spread to other countries. Meanwhile, the French had re-invented Adoption as an all-female lodge in 1901, only to cast <b>it</b> <b>aside</b> again in 1935. The lodges, however, continued to meet, which gave rise, in 1959, to a body of women practising continental Freemasonry.|$|E
5|$|On August 30, Arnold sent {{a letter}} {{accepting}} Clinton's terms and proposing a meeting to André through yet another intermediary: William Heron, {{a member of the}} Connecticut Assembly whom he thought he could trust. In an ironic twist, Heron went into New York unaware of the significance of the letter and offered his own services to the British as a spy. He then took the letter back to Connecticut, suspicious of Arnold's actions, where he delivered it {{to the head of the}} Connecticut militia. General Parsons laid <b>it</b> <b>aside,</b> seeing a letter written as a coded business discussion. Four days later, Arnold sent a ciphered letter with similar content into New York through the services of the wife of a prisoner of war. Eventually, a meeting was set for September 11 near Dobb's Ferry. This meeting was thwarted when British gunboats in the river fired on his boat, not being informed of his impending arrival.|$|E
5|$|The only {{objection}} is, {{not that}} the Court acted beyond its jurisdiction, but that it erred in its judgment of the law applicable to the case. If, then, we are to give any relief in this case, it is by a revision of {{the opinion of the}} Court, given {{in the course of a}} criminal trial, and thus asserting a right to control its proceedings, and take from them the conclusive effect which the law intended to give them. If this were an application for a habeas corpus, after judgment on an indictment for an offence within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, it could hardly be maintained, that this court could revise such a judgment, or the proceedings which led to it, or set <b>it</b> <b>aside,</b> and discharge the prisoner.|$|E

5|$|The site {{chosen for}} this summer retreat {{was in a}} secluded hollow. It had {{originally}} been owned by the Marquis of Castelo Rodrigo. When the ruling Spanish were driven from Portugal in 1640, the Marquis was accused of having collaborated with the Spanish and the property was seized by the Portuguese Crown. The estate and its hunting lodge then {{became one of the}} many properties of the Portuguese king, João IV. He set <b>it</b> <b>aside</b> as one of the properties reserved for the second son of the reigning monarch. Thus it came into the hands of Dom Pedro, the second son of João V.|$|E

During the mid-1980s, she began a factual book about an Alabama serial murderer, but also put <b>it</b> <b>aside</b> when she was not satisfied.

25|$|Although {{humans and}} animals are not {{traditionally}} seen as interchangeable, there are diachronical notions of unity between human and animal: imaginations about an ancient time when the animal could take on human form at will — it simply raised its forearm or wing to its face and lifted <b>it</b> <b>aside</b> at the muzzle or beak, like a mask. Ceremonies may help preserve this ancient unity: a masked person represents the animal and, as s/he lifts the mask, the human existence of that animal appears. Masks among Alaskan Natives could serve several functions. There are also transformation masks reflecting the mentioned unity between human and animal.|$|E

Gorbag threatens to stab Shagrat if he tries to steal the shirt, but he tosses <b>it</b> <b>aside</b> and throws Gorbag down a long flight of stairs, where he falls on top of several other Uruk-hai. A huge brawl between orcs and Uruk-hai spreads all over the fortress, allowing Sam to enter the tower with ease.|$|E
25|$|The {{mandatory}} {{nature of}} Harmelin's sentence {{also did not}} require setting <b>it</b> <b>aside.</b> First, as Scalia agreed, the Eighth Amendment did not require the trial court to allow Harmelin to present mitigating evidence. Second, if the Court were to set Harmelin's sentence aside, it would necessarily have to reject {{the judgment of the}} legislature, where the initial responsibility for making the substantive judgment about appropriate punishments rests. Third, Michigan's system did not entirely lack mechanisms for considering the individual circumstances of a particular defendant. Prosecutors have discretion in bringing charges, the governor has the power to grant clemency post hoc, and the legislature has the power to retroactively modify the sentence for all persons convicted of Harmelin's crime.|$|E

25|$|Twain {{initially}} {{conceived of}} the work as a sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer that would follow Huckleberry Finn through adulthood. Beginning with a few pages he had removed from the earlier novel, Twain began work on a manuscript he originally titled Huckleberry Finn's Autobiography. Twain worked on the manuscript {{off and on for}} the next several years, ultimately abandoning his original plan of following Huck's development into adulthood. He appeared to have lost interest in the manuscript while it was in progress, and set <b>it</b> <b>aside</b> for several years. After making a trip down the Hudson River, Twain returned to his work on the novel. Upon completion, the novel's title closely paralleled its predecessor's: Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Tom Sawyer's Comrade).|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the debate}} over {{contemporary}} Canadian identity is argued in political terms, and defines Canada as a country defined by its government policies, which are thought to reflect deeper cultural values. To the political philosopher Charles Blattberg, Canada should be conceived as a civic or political community, a community of citizens, one that contains many other kinds of communities within it. These include not only communities of ethnic, regional, religious, civic (the provincial and municipal governments) and civil associational sorts, but also national communities. Blattberg thus sees Canada as a multinational country and so asserts that it contains a number of nations within <b>it.</b> <b>Aside</b> from the various aboriginal First Nations, there is also the nation of francophone Quebecers, that of the anglophones who identify with English Canadian culture, and perhaps that of the Acadians.|$|E
