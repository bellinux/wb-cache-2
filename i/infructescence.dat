5|$|The hairpin banksia's <b>infructescence</b> is {{a typical}} Banksia cone-like structure, with up to 100 crowded {{embedded}} follicles which are 1–2.4centimetres (⅓–1in) in diameter; these generally remain closed until burnt by bushfire. The nonlignotuberous subspecies cunninghamii is killed by fire and regenerates from seed, while the others regenerate from buds {{around the base of}} the lignotuber. Old flower spikes fade to brown, then grey with age. Old flower parts usually persist for a long time, giving the <b>infructescence</b> a hairy appearance.

40|$|Species of Ophiostoma {{include some}} of the world's best known fungal {{pathogens}} of trees. Most members are vectored by arthropods. One {{of the most unusual}} niches in which Ophiostoma species have been found is within the <b>infructescences</b> of Protea species in South Africa. Recent molecular phylogenetic reconstructions on Ophiostoma s. l. suggested that the three Ophiostoma spp. specifically found in Protea <b>infructescences,</b> form a strongly supported monophyletic lineage within Ophiostoma s. s. In this study, new collections of Ophiostoma from Protea <b>infructescences</b> were subjected to molecular phylogenetic reconstructions based on large subunit, ITS and beta-tubulin sequence data. Using these techniques, at least five undescribed species of Ophiostoma have been identified from these plants. Intriguingly, our results also suggest a polyphyletic origin for the Protea-associated Ophiostoma spp. This indicates multiple invasions of this unusual niche, by these fungi. Our results also revealed the first case of an Ophiostoma sp. jumping hosts between a native Protea sp. and the non-native tree genus Eucalyptus. The second aim {{of this study was to}} identify putative vectors of the Ophiostoma spp. inhabiting Protea <b>infructescences</b> using both molecular and direct isolation methods. The presence of reproductive propagules of Ophiostoma spp. was confirmed on four Protea-associated mite species (Oodinychus sp., two Tarsonemus spp. and Proctolaelaps vandenbergi) at high frequencies. The Oodinychus sp. mite showed significantly higher reproductive rates when fed exclusively on Ophiostoma splendens than when it was fed on various other fungi. This suggests a mutualistic association between the Oodinychus sp. and O. splendens. Long distance dispersal of these mites was restricted to vectored dispersal via Protea-infructescence inhabiting beetles (e. g. Genuchus hottentottus). Mites collected from these beetles were found to vector spores of various Ophiostoma spp. Based on these results, our view is that these mites act as primary vectors of the Ophiostoma spp. in Protea <b>infructescences.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Botany and Zology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. The well-known, {{and often}} phytopathogenic, ophiostomatoid fungi are {{represented}} in South Africa by the two phylogenetically distantly related genera Ophiostoma (Ophiostomatales) and Gondwanamyces (Microascales). They are commonly associated with the fruiting structures (<b>infructescences)</b> of serotinous members of the African endemic plant genus Protea. The species O. splendens, O. africanum, O. protearum, G. proteae and G. capensis have been collected from various Protea spp. in South Africa where, like other ophiostomatoid fungi, they {{are thought to be}} transported by arthropod vectors. The present study set out to identify the vector organisms of Protea-associated members of mainly Ophiostoma species, using both molecular and direct isolation methods. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and taxon specific primers for the two Protea-associated ophiostomatoid genera were developed. Implementation of these newly developed methods revealed the presence of Ophiostoma and Gondwanamyces DNA on three insect species. They included a beetle (Genuchus hottentottus), a bug (Oxycarenus maculates) and a psocopteran species. It was, however, curious that the frequency of these insects that tested positive for ophiostomatoid DNA was very low, despite the fact that ophiostomatoid fungi are known to colonise more than 50 % of Protea <b>infructescences.</b> Subsequent direct isolation methods revealed the presence of reproductive propagules of Ophiostoma spp. on four Protea-associated mite species (Oodinychus sp., two Tarsonemus spp. and Proctolaelaps vandenbergi). These mites are numerous within Protea <b>infructescences</b> and Ophiostoma spp. were isolated from a high frequency of these individuals. The Oodinychus sp. mite was found to vector most of the Protea-associated Ophiostoma species. It was thus postulated that the mites (in particular the Oodinychus sp.) act as primary vectors of the Protea-associated Ophiostoma species. The association between Oodinychus mites collected from P. repens and O. splendens proved to be mutualistic. Mites feeding on this fungus showed significantly higher population growth than mites feeding on any of the other fungal species tested. The short- and long-distance dispersal methods of these mites were also investigated. Firstly the ability of mites to move from drying <b>infructescences</b> to moist and sheltered areas such as provided by intact <b>infructescences</b> on the same plant was investigated experimentally. Significantly more mites were found to actively disperse from drying <b>infructescences</b> to artificially manufactured <b>infructescences</b> containing moistened filter paper shreds than to artificially manufactured <b>infructescences</b> containing dry filter paper shreds. The frequent fires associated with the habitat of these mites would, however, require movement over larger areas than what would be possible through self-dispersal. Dispersal of mites via air currents was thus investigated using sticky traps, but no Ophiostoma-vectoring mites were captured in this way. Self-dispersal aided by air currents could thus be ruled out, and our investigations shifted to vectored dispersal. Numerous insects emerging from Ophiostoma-containing P. repens and P. neriifolia <b>infructescences</b> were collected using specially designed emergence cages. Scanning electron microscopy and stereo-microscopy revealed that all three Ophiostoma-vectoring mite genera were phoretic on the beetle G. hottentottus. Tarsonemus spp. and P. vandenbergi were also phoretic on the beetles Trichostetha fascicularis and T. capensis associated with P. repens and P. neriifolia flowers. Mites collected from the surface of these beetles were found to vector reproductive propagules of various Ophiostoma spp. This thus seems to be the only method of long-distance dispersal of these mites and subsequently also the Protea-associated Ophiostoma species. Molecular phylogenetic reconstruction based on large subunit, ITS and beta-tubulin DNA sequence data suggests a polyphyletic origin for the Protea-associated members of Ophiostoma, which proposes multiple invasions of this unusual niche by these fungi. These studies also revealed the presence of four new species of Ophiostoma associated with Protea spp. The new species O. palmiculminatum, O. phasma, O. gemellus and Sporothrix variecibatus were thus described. Ophiostoma palmiculminatum is associated with P. repens <b>infructescences</b> and the Oodinychus mites collected from them. Ophiostoma phasma was collected from various Protea and mite species. Ophiostoma gemellus and Sporothrix variecibatus were initially only isolated from mites, but have subsequently also been isolated from Protea spp. The present study clarifies many aspects pertaining to the phylogeny and ecology of the interesting members of Ophiostoma associated with Protea hosts. As such this study will form the platform for further studies on the co-evolution of these insect / mite / fungi / plant associations...|$|R

However, neither botanist considered this to be a new species at the time, instead holding it to be an unusual mountain form of the locally widespread B.marginata. Willis named the species after Victorian plantsman Bill Cane who had alerted authorities to the existence of an unusual banksia that was distinct from B.marginata some years previously. At the time, a plant collected from Mount Fulton near Port Davey in South West Tasmania was thought to be B.canei, but it was later reassessed as B.marginata. B.canei can be distinguished by its larger follicles and sharp points to the leaves.

They measure 1–2.5cm (0.4–1in) long, 0.6cm (0.2in) high and 0.8–2.2cm (0.3–0.9in) wide. They are quite flattened and lack a ridge along the valve line. When young, the follicles are greenish in colour and slightly sticky, and covered in fine white hairs, fading to tan or grey with age. They open with fire, releasing a winged wedge-shaped (cuneate) seed 2–2.5cm (0.8–1in) long. The mottled dark grey seed body is falcate (crescent-shaped) and measures 1.2–1.8cm (0.5–0.7in) long and 0.2–0.25cm (0.1in) wide, with a flattened dark brown wing 1.1–1.7cm (0.4–0.5in) wide. The woody separator has the same dimensions as the seed.|$|E
2500|$|B.subser. Leptophyllae was {{formally}} defined as containing those taxa with [...] "indurated and spinescent common bracts on the <b>infructescence</b> axes, and densely arachnose seedling stems." [...] The epithet Leptophyllae {{is taken from}} the specific epithet of the type species, B.leptophylla (slender-leaved banksia), from the Greek leptos ("fine, slender") and phyllon (leaf). It was selected as appropriate for the subseries, the species of which have long leaves that are narrower than most other species in B.ser. Abietinae.|$|E
2500|$|A fully mature kadam tree {{can reach}} up to [...] in height. It {{is a large}} tree with a broad crown and {{straight}} cylindrical bole. It is quick growing, with broad spreading branches and grows rapidly in the first 6–8 years. The trunk has a diameter of 100–160cm, but typically less than that. Leaves are [...] long. Flowering usually begins when the tree is 4–5 years old. Kadam flowers are sweetly fragrant, red to orange in colour, occurring in dense, globular heads of approximately [...] diameter. The fruit of N. cadamba occur in small, fleshy capsules packed closely {{together to form a}} fleshy yellow-orange <b>infructescence</b> containing approximately 8000 seeds. On maturing, the fruit splits apart, releasing the seeds, which are then dispersed by wind or rain.|$|E
50|$|Male {{and female}} flowers are borne on {{separate}} inflorescences. Male inflorescences {{are arranged in}} a spike, which is 4 - 12 cm long. Female inflorescences are arranged into a compact head which is 1 to 1.5 cm in diameter. The edible <b>infructescences</b> are 2.5 to 3.5 cm in diameter.|$|R
50|$|Cone bush, conebush, or cone-bush is {{a common}} name for various plants, usually {{dicotyledonous}} shrubs that bear their flowers and seeds in compact, cone-shaped inflorescences and <b>infructescences.</b> The plants that the name most frequently applies to {{are members of the}} Proteaceae, and in particular the Australian genus Isopogon and the African genus Leucadendron.|$|R
5000|$|Members of {{this family}} are {{characterized}} by drooping equisetoid (meaning [...] "looking like Equisetum"; that is, horsetail) twigs, evergreen foliage, monoecious or dioecious and <b>infructescences</b> ('fruiting bodies') cone-like, meaning combining together many outward-pointing valves, each containing a seed, into roughly spherical, cone-like, woody structures. The roots have nitrogen-fixing nodules that contain the soil actinomycete Frankia.|$|R
