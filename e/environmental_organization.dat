40|$|This paper {{examines}} the cooperative activity between national {{labor unions and}} national <b>environmental</b> <b>organizations</b> in the United States on issues associated with globalization. Past researchers have advocated the need for organizations that makeup the labor and environmental movements to work together, but do they? It is hypothesized that globalization issues may be a key factor for cooperative activity between national labor unions and national <b>environmental</b> <b>organizations.</b> The conducted research does find some evidence to support this claim. Industrial labor unions and politically oriented <b>environmental</b> <b>organizations</b> appear to be most active in working together on globalization issues. Associated with working together {{is the need for}} organizations to adopt a social justice frame that other organizations can support. The article concludes with a discussion of the importance of permanent, federative arrangements between national labor unions and national <b>environmental</b> <b>organizations...</b>|$|R
