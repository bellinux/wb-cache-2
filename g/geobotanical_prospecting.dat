Growing oca tuber root caps are covered in a fluorescent slush rich in harmaline and harmine which apparently suppresses pests; this phenomenon has been studied to some extent at the Colorado State University. Creeping wood sorrel and perhaps other species are apparently hyperaccumulators of copper. The Ming Dynasty text Precious Secrets of the Realm of the King of Xin from 1421 describes how O. corniculata {{can be used to}} locate copper deposits as well as for <b>geobotanical</b> <b>prospecting.</b> It thus ought to have some potential for phytoremediation of contaminated soils.|$|E
40|$|The use of LANDSAT as a {{tool for}} <b>geobotanical</b> <b>prospecting</b> was studied in a 13, 137 sq km area from southeastern Pennsylvania to {{northern}} Virginia. Vegetation differences between known serpentine and non-sepentine sites were most easily distinguished on early summer images. A multispectral signature was derived from vegetation of two known serpentine sites and a map was produced of 159 similar signatures of vegetation in the study area. Authenticity of the serpentine nature of the mapped sites was checked via geochemical analysis of collected soils from 14 % of the sites. Overall success of <b>geobotanical</b> <b>prospecting</b> was about 35 % for the total study area. When vegetation distribution was taken into account, the success rate was 67 % for the region north of the Potomac, demonstrates the effectiveness of the multispectral satellite for quickly and accurately locating mineral sensitive vegetation communities over vast tracts of land...|$|E

40|$|The {{concentration}} {{and distribution of}} metals were studied in metallophytes, growing on and {{in the vicinity of}} Pb–Zn gossans, NW Queensland. The study investigated the accumulation of metals in plant species and assessed their potential use as indicators in geobotanical and biogeochemical prospecting and as metal excluders in mine site rehabilitation. Plant species colonising the gossans tolerate high concentrations of metals. Total mean metal concentrations of soils ranged from minima of 14 ppm Cu, 28 ppm Pb and 34 ppm Zn in background areas to maxima of 660 ppm Cu, 12000 ppm Pb and 2100 ppm Zn over mineralised soils. Over the gossans, the grass species Eriachne mucronata forma, Enneapogon lindleyanus and Paraneurachne muelleri replace the characteristic grass Triodia molesta where the soils have high Pb and Zn concentrations. Of the 16 plant species identified, 3 of them, Hybanthus aurantiacus, Clerodendrum tomentosum and Bulbostylis barbata, were confined to the gossan sites. B. barbata appears to be of particular use in <b>geobotanical</b> <b>prospecting</b> as it indicates base metal mineralisation in the region. The biogeochemical analyses indicate significant enrichment of Cd, Pb and Zn in the tissue of all plant species, with the abundance of Cd, Pb and Zn in dried vegetation from the gossans being up to one order of magnitude above background. In particular, the uptake of Cd, Pb and Zn by Sida sp., T. molesta, Cleome viscosa and Eriachne mucronata forma increases linearly with DTPA-extractable soil metal concentrations. The biogeochemistry of these plants provides the best anomaly definition of the exposed gossans. Furthermore, the analysis of roots demonstrate that the plant species T. molesta, Eriachne mucronata forma and P. muelleri allow the transport of Cd, Pb and Zn from the roots to the above-ground biomass. Hence,the species best suited for biogeochemical prospecting for base metals in the region and semi-arid inland northern Australia are Eriachne mucronata and the genus Triodia. The analyses also reveal differences in the ability of each species to accumulate metals. Among all gossan plants, Eremophila latrobei displays distinctly low Pb concentrations and low correlations with soil DTPA extractable Pb. This plant is the most efficient in excluding Pb from its biomass, making it most suitable for the revegetation of Pb contaminated soils. This study demonstrates that biogeochemical examinations of gossans can reveal indicator and excluder plants, which are of potential use in mineral exploration as well as mined land reclamation...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) Soil {{contamination}} {{with heavy}} metal(loid) s {{is a major}} environmental problem that requires effective and affordable remediation technologies. The utilisation of plants to remediate heavy metal(loid) s contaminated soils has attracted considerable interest as a low cost green remediation technology. The process {{is referred to as}} phytoremediation, and this versatile technology utilises plants to phytostabilise and/or phytoextract heavy metal(loid) s from contaminated soils, thereby effectively minimising their threat to ecosystem, human and animal health. Plants that can accumulate exceptionally high concentrations of heavy metal(loid) s into above-ground biomass are referred to as hyperaccumulators, and may be exploited in phytoremediation, <b>geobotanical</b> <b>prospecting</b> and/or phytomining of low-grade ore bodies. Despite the apparent tangible benefits of utilising phytoremediation techniques, a greater understanding is required to comprehend the ecophysiological aspects of species suitable for phytoremediation purposes. A screening study was instigated to assess phytoremediation potential of several fern species for soils contaminated with cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn). Hyperaccumulation was not observed in any of the studied species, and in general, species excluded heavy metal uptake by restricting their translocation into aboveground biomass. Nephrolepis cordifolia and Hypolepis muelleri were identified as possible candidates in phytostabilisation of Cu-, Pb-, Ni- or Zn-contaminated soils and Dennstaedtia davallioides appeared favourable for use in phytostabilisation of Cu- and Zn-contaminated soils. Conversely, Blechnum nudum, B. cartilagineum, Doodia aspera and Calochlaena dubia were least tolerant to most heavy metals and were classified as being least suitable for phytoremediation purposes Ensuing studies addressed the physiology of arsenic (As) hyperaccumulation in a lesser known hyperaccumulator, Pityrogramma calomelanos var. austroamericana. The phytoremediation potential of this species was compared with that of the well known As hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata. Arsenic concentration of 3, 008 mg kg– 1 dry weight (DW) occurred in P. calomelanos var. austroamericana fronds when exposed to 50 mg kg– 1 As without visual symptoms of phytotoxicities. Conversely, P. vittata was able to hyperaccumulate 10, 753 mg As kg– 1 DW when exposed to 100 mg kg– 1 As without the onset of phytotoxicities. In P. calomelanos var. austroamericana, As was readily translocated to fronds with concentrations 75 times greater in fronds than in roots. This species has the potential for use in phytoremediation of soils with As levels up to 50 mg kg– 1. Localisation and spatial distribution of As in P. calomelanos var. austroamericana pinnule and stipe tissues was investigated using micro-proton induced X-ray emission spectrometry (µ-PIXE). Freeze-drying and freeze-substitution protocols (using tetrahydrofuran [THF] as a freeze-substitution medium) were compared to ascertain their usefulness in tissue preservation. Micro-PIXE results indicated that pinnule sections prepared by freeze-drying adequately preserved the spatial elemental distribution and tissue structure of pinnule samples. In pinnules, µ-PIXE results indicated higher As concentration than in stipe tissues, with concentrations of 3, 700 and 1, 600 mg As kg– 1 DW, respectively. In pinnules, a clear pattern of cellular localisation was not resolved whereas vascular bundles in stipe tissues contained the highest As concentration (2, 000 mg As kg– 1 DW). Building on these µ-PIXE results, the chemical speciation of As in P. calomelanos var. austroamericana was determined using micro-focused X-ray fluorescence (µ-XRF) spectroscopy in conjunction with micro-focused X-ray absorption near edge structure (µ-XANES) spectroscopy. The results suggested that arsenate (AsV) absorbed by roots was reduced to arsenite (AsIII) in roots prior to transport through vascular tissues as AsV and AsIII. In pinnules, AsIII was the predominant species, presumably as aqueous-oxygen coordinated compounds. Linear least-squares combination fits of µ-XANES spectra showed AsIII as the predominant component in all tissues sampled. The results also revealed that sulphur containing thiolates may, in part sequester accumulated As. The final aspect of this thesis examined several ecophysiological strategies of Ni hyperaccumulation in Hybanthus floribundus subsp. floribundus, a native Australian perennial shrub species and promising candidate in phytoremediation of Ni-contaminated soils. Micro-PIXE analysis revealed that cellular structure in leaf tissues prepared by freeze-drying was adequately preserved as compared to THF freeze-substituted tissues. Elemental distribution maps of leaves showed that Ni was preferentially localised in the adaxial epidermal tissues and leaf margin, with concentration of 10, 000 kg– 1 DW in both regions. Nickel concentrations in stem tissues obtained by µ-PIXE analysis were lower than in the leaf tissues (1, 800 mg kg– 1 vs. 7, 800 mg kg– 1 DW, respectively), and there was no clear pattern of compartmentalisation across different anatomical regions. It is possible that storage of accumulated Ni in epidermal tissues may provide Ni tolerance to this species, and may further act as a deterrent against herbivory and pathogenic attack. In H. floribundus subsp. floribundus seeds, µ-PIXE analysis did not resolve a clear pattern of Ni compartmentalisation and suggests that Ni was able to move apoplastically within the seed tissues. The role of organic acids and free amino acids (low molecular weight ligands [LMW]) in Ni detoxification in H. floribundus subsp. floribundus were quantified using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC). Nickel accumulation stimulated a significant increase in citric acid concentration in leaf extracts, and based on the molar ratios of Ni to citric acid (1. 3 : 1 – 1. 7 : 1), citric acid was sufficient to account for approximately 50...|$|E
