60|$|At that I ducked at once under water, and, <b>holding</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> until {{movement}} was an agony, blundered painfully ahead {{under the surface}} as long as I could. The water was in a tumult about me, and rapidly growing hotter.|$|R

60|$|So, as I was saying, I {{had gone}} down upon one knee, and was just {{reaching}} out a little stick to turn the Beetle over, when I saw a sight that made me draw back hastily and <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> for fear of making any noise and frightening the little creature a way.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was a close}} place. I took it up, {{and held}} it in my hand. I was a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of <b>holding</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> and then says to myself: ...|$|R

6000|$|For a {{few moments}} there was a horrible rushing sound in my ears, and I felt that I could <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> no longer when my head rose above the surface. I struck out with a gasp of relief, which was, as it were, echoed close to me. I looked round, as well as {{darkness}} and water would allow, and observed an object floating near me. I pushed towards it, and just as I caught hold, I heard a panting voice exclaim-- ...|$|E

"It won't do to run; but you {{can keep}} close at my heels," [...] the captain said as he set off at a walk which fully equaled running, and we {{followed}} very closely, I literally <b>holding</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> as I tried {{to realize that the}} task which had seemed so formidable a few moments previous, had been accomplished with the greatest ease.|$|R
6000|$|Impossible {{to doubt}} the truth of that; his whole face showed it, as he spoke through his set teeth, and {{launched}} a fiery glance at the unconscious captain. I could only <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> and stare blankly at him, wondering what mad act was coming next. I suppose I shook and turned white, as women have a foolish habit of doing when sudden danger daunts them; for Robert released my arm, sat down upon the bedside {{just in front of}} me, and said, with the ominous quietude that made me cold to see and hear,-- ...|$|E

60|$|The {{stars were}} marvellous in the soundless sky, so big, {{that one could}} see them hanging orb-like and alone in their own space, yet all the myriads. Particularly bright the evening-star. And he hung {{flashing}} in the lower night with a power that made me <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath.</b> Grand and powerful he sent out his flashes, so sparkling that he seemed more intense than any sun or moon. And from the dark, uprising land he sent his way of light to us across the water, a marvellous star-road. So all above us the stars soared and pulsed, over that silent, night-dark, land-locked harbour.|$|E

60|$|Gently and reverently I {{lifted her}} in my arms, an {{intoxication}} of holy joy pervading me, and the prayers falling faster from my lips than ever they had done since as a lad I had recited them at my mother's knee. A moment I laid her on the bench, whilst I divested myself of my cloak. Then suddenly I paused, and stood listening, <b>holding</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{place was}} a tiny gorge, with but one entrance, which was hidden behind a barren spur of rock--just a sort of long fissure, jagged and curving, in the rock, like a fault in the stratification. I could just {{struggle}} through it with considerable effort, <b>holding</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> here and there, so as to reduce my depth of chest. Within it was tree-clad, and full of possibilities of concealment.|$|R
6000|$|So, after resting {{a little}} while, and getting my breath again, down I went. I {{was in for}} {{anything}} now, and the moment I reached the bottom, I swept my arm around and seized the first thing I touched. It was a pretty big thing, for it was a sea-feather over five feet high,--a regular tree. I gave a jerk at it, but it held fast. I wished, most earnestly, that I had taken hold of something smaller, but I didn't like to let go. I might get nothing else. I gave another jerk, but it was of no use. I felt that I couldn't <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> much longer, and must go up. I clutched the stem of the thing with both hands; I braced my feet against the bottom; I gave a tremendous tug and push, and up I came to the top, sea-feather and all! ...|$|E
60|$|Lesage cowered {{up against}} the table, with his agonised eyes fixed upon the blue-black square of the door. The man who had befriended me still swayed his body about with a {{singular}} half-smile upon his face. His skinny hand was twitching at the frill of his shirt, and I conjectured that he held some weapon concealed there. Toussac stood {{between them and the}} open door, and, much as I feared and loathed him, I could not take my eyes from his gallant figure. As to myself, I was so much occupied by the singular drama before me, and by the impending fate of those three men of the cottage, that all thought of my own fortunes had passed completely out of my mind. On this mean stage a terrible all-absorbing drama was being played, and I, crouching in a squalid recess, was to be the sole spectator of it. I could but <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> and wait and watch.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} they would do," [...] said Bartley. [...] "But it's their lookout now, if they come. Wrap your face up well, or put your head under the robe. I've got to <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> the next half-mile." [...] He loosed the reins, and sped the colt out of the shelter where he had halted. The wind struck them like an edge of steel, and, {{catching}} the powdery snow that their horse's hoofs beat up, sent it spinning and swirling far along the glistening levels on their lee. They felt {{the thrill of the}} go as if they were in some light boat leaping over a swift current. Marcia disdained to cover her face, if he must confront the wind, but after a few gasps she was glad to bend forward, and bury it in the long hair of the bearskin robe. When she lifted it, they were already past the siding, and she saw a cutter dashing toward them from the cover of the woods. [...] "Bartley!" [...] she screamed, [...] "the sleigh!" ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was nothing}} to do but to swim for it, which, in that wild confusion, was at the best a matter of but a few moments. <b>Holding</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> and working with my hands, I managed to get off my heavy sea-boots and my jacket. Yet there was very little breath I could catch to hold, and I swiftly {{discovered}} that it was not so much a matter of swimming as of breathing.|$|R

"Within {{the first}} 10 minutes of Joss Whedon's [...] "Much Ado About Nothing," [...] I found myself smiling with excitement, while also <b>holding</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> in nervous anxiety. Would the film {{be able to}} sustain its {{confident}} manic tone, maintain its humor and smarts, its depth of characterization and innovative use of text and landscape? Would the magic hold? The magic holds. It holds from beginning to end." [...] —Sheila O'Malley, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times.|$|R
6000|$|... "I snooped around {{through the}} bushes, <b>holding</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> mighty hard, for Mr. Fox {{has a good}} pair of ears, till I was among a lot of {{raspberry}} vines not so very far from the old oak. I crept 'way in among them, although I got some pretty bad scratches, and when I was so far in {{that there was no}} danger the 'Squire could get hold of me, I sung out the best I knew how: ...|$|R
60|$|Then it descended, pandemonium broke loose, {{everything}} {{happened at}} once. I was struck a crushing, stunning blow, nowhere {{in particular and}} yet everywhere. My hold had been broken loose, I was under water, and the thought passed through my mind {{that this was the}} terrible thing of which I had heard, the being swept in the trough of the sea. My body struck and pounded as it was dashed helplessly along and turned over and over, and when I could <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> no longer, I breathed the stinging salt water into my lungs. But through it all I clung to the one idea—I must get the jib backed over to windward. I had no fear of death. I had no doubt but that I should come through somehow. And as this idea of fulfilling Wolf Larsen’s order persisted in my dazed consciousness, I seemed to see him standing at the wheel {{in the midst of the}} wild welter, pitting his will against the will of the storm and defying it.|$|E
60|$|In {{an instant}} I {{knew what had}} happened. There was a big mud-scow lying {{by the side of}} the wharf, and I had got under that! It was a great flat thing, ever so long and very wide. I knew I must get from under it as quickly as I could. Indeed, I could hardly <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> now. I waded along with my head bent down, but I didn't reach the side of it. Then I turned the other way, but my hands, which I held up, still touched nothing but the hard, slimy bottom of the scow. I must have been wading up and down the length of the thing. I was bewildered. I couldn't think which way to turn. I could only think of one thing. I would be drowned in less than a minute. Scott would be head of the class. My mother, and little Helen--but I can't tell what my {{thoughts}} were then. They were dreadful. But just as I was thinking of Helen and mother, I saw through the water some white things, not far from me. I knew by their looks that they were a boy's legs.|$|E
60|$|The {{last time}} {{of these two}} had well near been fatal to me; for the sea having hurried me along as before, landed me, or rather dashed me against {{a piece of a}} rock, and that with such force, as it left me senseless, and indeed helpless, as to my own deliverance; for the blow taking my side and breast, beat the breath as it were quite out of my body; and had it {{returned}} again immediately, I must have been strangled in the water; but I recovered a little before the return of the waves, and seeing I should be covered again with the water, I resolved to hold fast by a piece of the rock, and so to <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> if possible, till the wave went back. Now as the waves were not so high as at first, being near land, I held my hold till the wave abated, and then fetched another run, which brought me so near the shore, that the next wave, though it went over me, yet did not so swallow me up as to carry me away; and the next run I took I got to the main land, where, to my great comfort, I clambered up the clifts of the shore, and sat me down upon the grass, free from danger, and quite {{out of the reach of}} the water.|$|E
5000|$|The {{theme of}} [...] "First Time" [...] {{is about the}} early stages of romance and {{specifically}} takes a look back at the butterflies and excitement of the initial rush of romance. The lyrics [...] "Looking at you / <b>Holding</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> / For once in my life / I'm scared to death / I'm taking a chance / Letting you inside" [...] refer to how mature love requires vulnerability, sacrifice and effort, which is a responsibility that distinguishes serious commitment from youthful romantic discovery.|$|R
2500|$|The Advocate, while {{supporting}} {{the film in}} general, criticized the choice of Penn given the actor's support for the Cuban government despite the country's anti-gay rights record.

5000|$|Asked in an {{interview}} in November 2008 if he can imagine Orcs: First Blood on film, Nicholls answered: [...] One of the major Hollywood studios is talking to my agent at the moment, and another, European, studio has expressed interest. But I’m not even thinking about it. I’ve been on this merry dance before. I’ve had books optioned by film companies and then dropped. It’s a much more common experience for writers than you might think, but it almost always comes to nothing. So a movie would be nice, but I’m not <b>holding</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|R
