5|$|Following {{the power}} {{struggle}} after Stalin's death in 1953, Nikita Khrushchev {{emerged as the}} country's new leader. In a secret speech he gave in 1956, Khrushchev denounced Stalin and his domestic policies largely loosened the government's grip over the country. Khrushchev put more resources into the production of consumer goods and housing. Almost immediately, Armenia underwent a cultural and economic rebirth. Religious freedom, to a limited degree, was granted to Armenia when Catholicos Vazgen <b>I</b> <b>assumed</b> the duties of his office in 1955. One of Khrushchev's advisers and close friends, Armenian Politburo member Anastas Mikoyan, urged Armenians to reaffirm their national identity. In 1954, he gave a speech in Yerevan where he encouraged them to republish the works of writers such as Raffi and Charents. The massive statue of Stalin that towered over Yerevan was pulled down from its pedestal by troops literally overnight and replaced in 1962 with that of Mother Armenia. Contacts between Armenia and the Diaspora were revived, and Armenians from abroad began to visit the republic more frequently.|$|E

25|$|After {{the death}} of Queen Elizabeth I, in 1603 King James <b>I</b> <b>assumed</b> the throne of England. After years of war, England was {{strapped}} for funds, so he granted responsibility for England's New World colonization to the Virginia Company, which became incorporated as a joint stock company by a proprietary charter drawn up in 1606. There were two competing branches of the Virginia Company and each hoped to establish a colony in Virginia in order to exploit gold (which the region did not actually have), to establish a base of support for English privateering against Spanish ships, and to spread Protestantism to the New World in competition with Spain's spread of Catholicism. Within the Virginia Company, the Plymouth Company branch was assigned a northern portion of the area known as Virginia, and the London Company area to the south.|$|E
25|$|When Boris <b>I</b> <b>assumed</b> {{the throne}} of Bulgaria in 852, the country was still pagan, with the ruling Bulgar elite being Tengriists while the Slavic {{population}} practised its own religion. Christianity was already widespread in Bulgaria as the country was established on former territories of the Byzantine Empire, and {{seems to have been}} influential. Even one of the sons of Khan Omurtag (r. 814–831), Enravota, converted to Christianity. The Bulgarian nobility was strongly opposed to any form of Byzantine influence in the country and was therefore hostile to Christianity as it was directly associated with the Byzantine Empire. Boris I, however, had many reasons to consider conversion— Bulgaria was situated between two powerful Christian empires, Byzantium and East Francia; Christian doctrine particularly favoured the position of the monarch as God's representative on Earth; and finally, Boris also saw Christianity as a way to overcome the differences between Bulgars and Slavs. The geopolitical situation in the mid 9th century was also favourable because of the increasing friction and rivalry between the Papacy in Rome and the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople for influence in Central Europe. That struggle between the two churches would give the Bulgarian ruler the opportunity to manoeuvre and negotiate with both, thus extracting favourable concessions while keeping the country out of direct foreign influence. When the Byzantines invaded Bulgaria in the autumn of 863 and demanded conversion to Christianity from Constantinople as the single condition to retreat, Boris I readily accepted and was baptised in the beginning of 864, assuming the Christian name Michael after his spiritual godfather, the Byzantine Emperor Michael III. That step was very unpopular among the nobility, but when they rebelled Boris I dealt decisively with them and executed 52 magnates along with their whole families. When in the following year the Byzantines sturdily demonstrated their determination not to allow the existence of an autocephalous Bulgarian Church, Boris I decided to turn to the Papacy.|$|E

Ahmose <b>I</b> <b>assumed</b> the throne after the death of his brother, and upon coronation became known as Neb-Pehty-Re (The Lord of Strength is Re).

This outreach was credited with saving the life of one woman who went to the hospital after experiencing symptoms of a heart attack.|$|E
500|$|No.30 Communications Unit was {{headquartered}} at Iwakuni, {{along with}} the rest of No.91 Wing's components except No.77 Squadron, which was based on the Korean peninsula.

According to Hitchens, [...] "Having commanded the communications flight in No. 77 Squadron, <b>I</b> <b>assumed</b> control but had no formal authority to do so, but nobody told me to stop." [...] The transport aircraft included the personal Dakota of the BCOF commander, Lieutenant General Sir Horace Robertson, operating under his direction. [...] During November 1950, the unit received another four Dakotas from No.38 Squadron (of No.90 (Composite) Wing in Malaya), giving it a total strength of eight Dakotas and two Austers. It supported all Australian forces in Korea. One of its key functions was medical evacuation, but it was also responsible for supply drops, search and rescue, reconnaissance, and mail delivery, as well as transporting cargo, troops, and VIPs. Unlike No.77 Squadron, it was not tasked by the US Fifth Air Force but instead operated under Australian control, exercised through BCOF headquarters in Japan. In December 1950 the unit undertook [...] "Operation Haggis", the delivery of [...] of haggis to the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders based in Suwon, Korea.
