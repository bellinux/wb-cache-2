50|$|Prior to Bensaude's work, <b>heterothallism</b> {{had already}} been {{described}} in lower fungi, the Zygomycetes, by Albert Francis Blakeslee, published in Science (1904).

50|$|Bensaude's thesis {{described}} {{the formation of}} clamp connections in the diploid thallus of Coprinus fimetarius syn. Coprinopsis cinerea, and the homology between the hook of ascogenous hyphae and clamp connections. Bensaude’s report of <b>heterothallism</b> in basidiomycetes was met with some doubt as <b>heterothallism</b> was assumed not to occur in higher fungi (Jones, 1972). German botanist Hans Kniep, unaware of Bensaude’s work due to the chaos of World War I in Europe, presented identical findings 2 years after Bensaude’s thesis in 1920. Kniep’s detailed work corroborated Bensaude's, with both studies contributing major insights into the mating behavior of higher fungi. Kniep, Arthur Henry Reginald Buller, and Buller’s students went on to further study fungal mating systems and behavior (Ainsworth, 1976). Buller in his Researches in Fungi (1958) wrote a dedication to Bensaude for her significant contributions to the cytological behavior of fungi.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{report of}} sex in fungi occurred {{two centuries ago}} based on observations of the fungus Syzygites mealocarpus (Mucoromycotina) (reviewed by Idnurm). This species was also subsequently used in 1904 to represent self-fertile species when the concept of two major mating strategies were developed for the fungi. These strategies are homothallism for self-fertile fungi and <b>heterothallism</b> for self-incompatible, outcrossing fungi.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the species}} within Basidiomycota have the most complex systems of sexual {{reproduction}} known among Fungi. In general for Fungi {{there are two main}} types of sexual reproduction: homothallism, when mating occurs within a single individual, or in other words each individual is self-fertile; and <b>heterothallism,</b> when hyphae from a single individual is self-sterile and needs to interact with another compatible individual for mating to take place. Additionally, mating compatibility in the Basidiomycota is further categorized into two types of mating systems: tetrapolar and bipolar.|$|E

Her mother, Jane Oulman Bensaude was a French author of children's books. Mathilde Bensaude was an internationally known mycologist and plant pathologist whose pioneering doctoral thesis at the Sorbonne first showed <b>heterothallism</b> in the Basidiomycetes.

50|$|Fungal species {{within the}} phylum Basidiomycetes, {{including}} mushroom-forming species, experience {{a more complex}} reproductive cycle. They contain the ability to self-fertilize (homothallism) or more commonly require hyphae from two individuals of different mating types to make contact and fertilize (<b>heterothallism).</b> Heterothallic fertilization occurs once two haploid mycelia (homokaryons) of different mating types have made contact. They then exchange nuclei and migrate to form a dikaryotic hyphae (heterokaryon) containing two separate haploid nuclei, one from each parent. The dikaryon then grows and may produce a diploid fruiting body that immediately undergoes meiosis to form four haploid mycelia which can then be fertilized by another nucleus. The dikaryon can also simultaneously fertilize again by donating a nucleus to another homokaryon.|$|E
50|$|<b>Heterothallism</b> is {{the most}} common mating system in Basidiomycota and in Agaricomycotina (the mushroom-forming Fungi) about 90% of the species are heterothallic. The tetrapolar type of mating system is ruled by two unlinked mating loci termed A and B (in Agaricomycotina) or b and a (in Ustilaginomycotina and Pucciniomycotina), both of which can be multiallelic. The {{combination}} of A and B (or b and a) alleles, termed mating type, determine the specificity or sexual identity of the individual harboring them. Only individuals with different specificities are compatible with each other and therefore able to start the mating event. A successful mating interaction begins with nuclear exchange and nuclear migration resulting in the formation of dikaryotic hyphae (containing separate haploid nuclei from both initial parents). Dikaryotic hyphae, under the appropriate environmental conditions will give rise to the fruiting body which contains the basidia - specialized cells in which sexual recombination via karyogamy and meiosis occurs. This dikaryotic condition in Basidiomycota is often maintained by a specialized hyphal structure called a clamp connection. The formation of clamp connections is regulated by both mating loci. Examples of tetrapolar organisms are the smuts Ustilago maydis and U. longissima, and the mushrooms Coprinopsis cinerea, Schizophyllum commune, Pleurotus djamor and Laccaria bicolor. It is believed that multi-allelic systems favor outcrossing in Basidiomycota. For example, in the case of U. maydis, which bears more than 25 b but only 2 a specificities, an individual has an approximately 50% chance to encounter a compatible mate in nature. However, species such as C. cinerea, which has more than 240 A and B specificities each, and S. commune, which has more than 339 A specificities and 64 B specificities, approach close to 100% chance of encountering a compatible partner in nature due to the huge number of mating types generated by these systems.|$|E

Nutritionally forced intra- and interspecific matings provide genetic information about the relatedness of homothallic isolates, {{the relation of the}} various species to one another, the genetic basis of homothallism, and its relationship to <b>heterothallism.</b> Most homothallic isolates are interfertile when nutritionally forced. Successful hybridization between species is restricted to particular combinations of homothallic x bipolar isolates. Significant findings of these studies include: (1) documentation of hybridization of biological species in the Homobasidiomycetes, (2) documentation of the relatedness of two naturally occurring, variant systems, homothallism and bipolar <b>heterothallism,</b> that regulate sexual morphogenesis in the higher fungi, (3) evidence for definite, but limited, evolutionary divergence of the polygenic, regulated components of the respective systems, and (4) indication that the genetic basis of homothallism in this system is essentially due to constitutive function and consequently is fundamentally different from presently understood mechanisms in other self-fertile systems...|$|E

40|$|In most fungal ascomycetes, mating is {{controlled}} by a single locus (MAT). Fungi requiring a partner to mate are heterothallic (self-sterile); those not requiring a partner are homothallic (self-fertile). Structural analyses of MAT sequences from homothallic and heterothallic Cochliobolus species {{support the hypothesis that}} <b>heterothallism</b> is ancestral. Homothallic species carry both MAT genes in a single nucleus, usually closely linked or fused, in contrast to heterothallic species, which have alternate MAT genes in different nuclei. The structural organization of MAT from all heterothallic species examined is highly conserved; in contrast, the organization of MAT in each homothallic species is unique. The mechanism of conversion from <b>heterothallism</b> to homothallism is a recombination event between islands of identity in otherwise dissimilar MAT sequences. Expression of a fused MAT gene from a homothallic species confers self-fertility on a MAT-null strain of a heterothallic species, suggesting that MAT alone is sufficient to change reproductive life style...|$|E

Subsequently, two compatible single-ascospore strains of each variety of P. herpotrichoides were paired with isolates from lesions on plants collected in a naturally infested field in Belgium. The patterns of pairings between isolates of P. h. var. herpotrichoides in which mature apothecia were formed is consistent with bipolar <b>heterothallism</b> as the mechanism controlling sexual compatibility in T. yallundae.

40|$|Heterothallic, facultatively sexual {{populations are}} {{vulnerable}} {{to the loss of}} a mating type by natural selection during periods of asexual reproduction. Experiments are described which demonstrate a competitive difference between the mating types of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a unicellular green alga with two isogamous mating types, mt + and mt $-. $ When grown vegetatively under phototrophic (light) conditions, mt + outcompetes mt $-. $ Assays of the growth parameters of isolated spores suggest that mt + has a higher growth rate than mt $-$ in the light, and that mt $-$ has a higher growth rate than mt + in heterotrophic (dark) growth conditions. A literature review shows that sampling from natural populations of heterothallic, facultatively sexual species often yields only one mating type or significantly skewed mating-type distributions. This indicates that competition between mating types and the consequent loss of one mating type may be common in these populations. A discussion of current theories on the evolution of <b>heterothallism</b> as well as the results of a simulation model reveal that <b>heterothallism</b> will spread if any fitness reduction is suffered by in-crossing homothallic individuals. However, fitness differences between the heterothallic alleles allow the invasion of a homothallic allele into a heterothallic population. The implications of mating type competition on the maintenance and distribution of heterothallic populations in nature are discussed. It is argued that heterothallic, facultatively sexual populations commonly lose the potential for sex because of the loss of one mating-type allele. The prediction is made that homothallism is more common among facultatively sexual organisms than it is among obligately sexual organisms...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Studies were {{conducted}} on pathogenic specialization and <b>heterothallism</b> in Sphaerotheca pannosa var. rosae, causal agent of rose powdery mildew. Methods were developed for isolation and identification of Sphaerotheca pannosa var. rosae races on rose. Monoconidial isolates were initiated on detached leaves, increased on host plants, and inoculated to rose cultivars to obtain differential reactions. Virulence was evaluated by assessing the infection type of individual lesions {{and the percentage of}} leaf area covered with sporulating colonies. Five races of S. pannosa var. rosae were identified, and virulence formulae were developed to describe them on four differential cultivars. The susceptibility of detached rose leaves to S. pannosa var. rosae isolates of unknown and known virulence was assessed on physiologically similar tissue and compared with results on attached leaves. The correlation between inoculation to detached and attached leaves varied with the host and host-pathogen interaction. Detached leaves are useful in screening for differences in host specificity, but should not be used exclusively. Virulence patterns were studied in several conidial populations of S. pannosa var. rosae. Although pathogenic variation was greater in the field, repeated sampling of both field and green house locations demonstrated that rose powdery mildew populations are dynamic. Two populations consisted of more than one race; all others were racially homogenous. In one population, the presence of cleistothecia and ratio of pathotype occurrence suggested the meiotic recombination of two virulence factors. The sexuality of S. pannosa var. rosae was investigated. Nine monoconidial isolates were coinoculated to four rose hosts in 11 combinations. <b>Heterothallism</b> was demonstrated by the strong fruiting response which occurred when an isolate designated as RR 1 was paired with two other isolates. In the nine combinations where cleistothecia did not form, the coinoculated isolates differed in host specificity and were reisolated when the experiment was terminated.

The genus Phytophthora was confirmed to be monophyletic. In addition, results confirm that the classical taxonomic grouping as described by [Waterhouse (1963) ] does not reflect true phylogenetic relations. Phytophthora species were redistributed into 8 clades, providing a more accurate representation of phylogenetic relationships within the genus Phytophthora.

The organism was subsequently used in 1904 to represent self-fertile homothallic species when the concepts of <b>heterothallism</b> and homothallism were developed for the fungal kingdom. In this study, two putative sex/MAT loci were identified in individual strains of S. megalocarpus, accounting for its homothallic behavior. The strains encode both of the high-mobility-group domain-containing proteins, SexM and SexP, flanked by RNA helicase and glutathione oxidoreductase genes that are found adjacent to the mating-type loci in other Mucoromycotina species. The presence of pseudogenes and the arrangement of genes suggest that the origin of homothallism in this species is from a heterothallic relative, obtained via a chromosomal rearrangement to switch two alleles into two separated loci within a single genetic background.

40|$|UNLABELLED: Pneumocystis {{species are}} fungal parasites of mammal lungs showing host specificity. Pneumocystis jirovecii colonizes humans and causes severe {{pneumonia}} in immunosuppressed individuals. In {{the absence of}} in vitro cultures, {{the life cycle of}} these fungi remains poorly known. Sexual reproduction probably occurs, but the system of this process and the mating type (MAT) genes involved are not characterized. In the present study, we used comparative genomics to investigate the issue in P. jirovecii and Pneumocystis carinii, the species infecting rats, as well as in their relative Taphrina deformans. We searched sex-related genes using 103 sequences from the relative Schizosaccharomyces pombe as queries. Genes homologous to several sex-related role categories were identified in all species investigated, further supporting sexuality in these organisms. Extensive in silico searches identified only three putative MAT genes in each species investigated (matMc, matMi, and matPi). In P. jirovecii, these genes clustered on the same contig, proving their contiguity in the genome. This organization seems compatible neither with <b>heterothallism,</b> because two different MAT loci on separate DNA molecules would have been detected, nor with secondary homothallism, because the latter involves generally more MAT genes. Consistently, we did not detect cis-acting sequences for mating type switching in secondary homothallism, and PCR revealed identical MAT genes in P. jirovecii isolates from six patients. A strong synteny of the genomic region surrounding the putative MAT genes exists between the two Pneumocystis species. Our results suggest the hypothesis that primary homothallism is the system of reproduction of Pneumocystis species and T. deformans. IMPORTANCE: Sexual reproduction among fungi can involve a single partner (homothallism) or two compatible partners (<b>heterothallism).</b> We investigated the issue in three pathogenic fungal relatives: Pneumocystis jirovecii, which causes severe pneumonia in immunocompromised humans; Pneumocystis carinii, which infects rats; and the plant pathogen Taphrina deformans. The nature, the number, and the organization within the genome of the genes involved in sexual reproduction were determined. The three species appeared to harbor a single genomic region gathering only three genes involved in sexual differentiation, an organization which is compatible with sexual reproduction involving a single partner.

A lower proportion of homokaryotic (n) meiospores, which typify the heterothallic life cycle, also are produced. In wild populations, pseudohomothallism was thought previously to play a major role, but recent analyses have found that significant outcrossing also may occur. We inoculated a standard substrate for A. bisporus cultivation simultaneously with homokaryotic mycelium from one parent and spores from a second parent. Culture trays produced numerous sporocarps that could theoretically have resulted from five different reproductive modes (pseudohomothallism, selfing or outcrossing via <b>heterothallism,</b> and selfing or outcrossing via the Buller phenomenon [i. e., between a homokaryon and a heterokaryon]). Most or all of the sporocarps resulted from outcrossing between the inoculated homokaryon and the inoculated heterokaryotic spores (or mycelia that grew from them).
