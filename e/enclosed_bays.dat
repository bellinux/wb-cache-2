25|$|Found only in Lincolnshire, {{this type}} {{has become known}} as a Lincolnshire three-bay pillbox. It is {{essentially}} a modification of the FW3 type 23 having an open light anti-aircraft position in the centre and fully <b>enclosed</b> <b>bays</b> at either end. 44 examples of this type remain extant.|$|E
500|$|About {{twenty percent}} of the {{national}} park is covered by lakes. The entire park is drained through two tributaries of the Pasvikelva, one draining Ellenvatn and one draining Ødevatn. Ellenvatn is the largest lake; located centrally in the park, it is drained from the north. It has two <b>enclosed</b> <b>bays</b> to the south, Parvatn and Skinnposevatn. Ødevann, located in the southeast, is the second-largest lake. Many of the smaller lakes are [...] being filled with peat, a process which began following {{the end of the last}} glacial period. Many of the bogs have previously been lakes but have been transformed over the years.|$|E
500|$|The {{leopard shark}} {{occurs in the}} cool to warm-temperater {{continental}} waters of the northeastern Pacific Ocean, from Coos Bay, Oregon to Mazatlán, Mexico, including the Gulf of California. It favors muddy or sandy flats within <b>enclosed</b> <b>bays</b> and estuaries, and may also be encountered near kelp beds and rocky reefs, or along the open coast. Numbers {{have been known to}} gather near discharges of warm effluent from power plants. Leopard sharks generally swim close to the bottom and are most abundant from the intertidal zone to a depth of , though they may be found as deep as [...] Many leopard sharks, particularly in the north, leave their coastal habitats in winter and return in early spring. A study in Tomales Bay in northern California determined that they depart when the water temperature drops below 1012°C (5054°F); one tagged shark was found to have swum some [...] south.|$|E

2500|$|In general, {{landslides}} generate displacements {{mainly in}} the shallower parts of the coastline, and there is conjecture {{about the nature of}} large landslides that enter water. [...] This has been shown to subsequently affect water in <b>enclosed</b> <b>bays</b> and lakes, but a landslide large enough to cause a transoceanic tsunami has not occurred within recorded history. Susceptible locations are believed to be the Big Island of Hawaii, Fogo in the Cape Verde Islands, La Reunion in the Indian Ocean, and Cumbre Vieja on the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands; along with other volcanic ocean islands. This is because large masses of relatively unconsolidated volcanic material occurs on the flanks and in some cases detachment planes are believed to be developing. However, there is growing controversy about how dangerous these slopes actually are.|$|E

5000|$|The Venetian Lagoon (Laguna di Venezia; Łaguna de Venesia) is an <b>enclosed</b> <b>bay</b> of the Adriatic Sea, in {{northern}} Italy, {{in which the}} city of Venice is situated. Its name in the Italian and Venetian languages, —cognate of Latin , [...] "lake"—has provided the international name for an enclosed, shallow embayment of salt water, a lagoon.|$|R
50|$|The steeply {{pitched roof}} is timber framed and clad in painted {{corrugated}} iron. It has no overhangs {{as the former}} hotel was originally built with verandahs. The front verandahs were replaced by <b>enclosed</b> skillion roofed <b>bays</b> which have recently been demolished. On the western or Wantley Street elevation the floor, framing and stumps of the <b>enclosed</b> <b>bay</b> remains. The rear U-shaped verandah is of relatively recent construction. The low pitched roof of this verandah conceals {{the top of a}} transom light over a rear door.|$|R

50|$|Members of {{this family}} are {{commonly}} known as the numbfishes, and are found almost worldwide in warm temperate and tropical continental and continental insular waters. They are strictly marine, so are absent from rivers and lakes. They occur in sandy beaches, muddy <b>enclosed</b> <b>bays,</b> estuaries, off coral reefs and river mouths, and on the upper continental slope to a depth of 1,071 m.|$|E
50|$|Southern Djursland has {{a mix of}} {{different}} types of stony and sandy beaches. In the more <b>enclosed</b> <b>bays</b> there isn’t the same exchange of water as on the exposed eastern shores of Djursland facing the Kattegat Sea. As a consequence the bottom in the southern bay land is home to less fish life, and fewer species of sea weed and other marine life.|$|E

50|$|Geographically, Nice {{consists}} of two large bays. Villefranche-sur-Mer sits on an <b>enclosed</b> <b>bay,</b> while the main expanse of the city lies between the old port city and the Aeroport de Côte d'Azur, across a gently curving bay. The city rises from the flat beach into gentle rising hills, then is bounded by surrounding mountains that represent the Southern and nearly the Western extent of the Ligurian Alps range.|$|R
50|$|Oceanodromous marine demersal. Depth range {{shore to}} 800 m, usually 100 - 300 m but {{sometimes}} seen much shallower. Sandy or muddy bottoms. Found in shallow <b>enclosed</b> <b>bays</b> {{and on the}} continental slope. Feeds on invertebrates, bony fishes and fish offal. Oviparous: Eggs cases are dark brown and have horn-like projections on the shell. Migrates towards the coastal shallows during the warm season and towards deep waters in winter.|$|E
50|$|Almost {{all modern}} {{predation}} of narwhals is by humans. Other predators are polar bears, which attack at breathing holes mainly for young narwhals, Greenland sharks and walruses. Killer whales (orcas) group together to overwhelm narwhal pods {{in the shallow}} water of <b>enclosed</b> <b>bays,</b> in one case killing dozens of narwhals in a single attack. To escape predators such as orcas, narwhals may use prolonged submergence to hide under ice floes {{rather than relying on}} speed.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{water quality}} control plan for <b>enclosed</b> <b>bays</b> and {{estuaries}} {{whose objective is to}} protect the benthic community from direct exposure to pollutants in the sediment. It also seeks to minimize the human health risk due to the consumption of shellfish and fish that may have high levels of toxic contaminants in them. The plan also includes the beneficial uses, their objectives and how these objectives will continue to enhance the water quality.|$|E
5000|$|The Bakar raid was {{conceived}} by the Italians {{as an attack}} on Austrian shipping in the harbour at Buccari (now Bakar, in Croatia) a port in an <b>enclosed</b> <b>bay</b> (the Bay of Bakar) near Fiume, {{at the head of}} the Kvarner Gulf.As it lay 80 km into a sheltered waterway, it was thought to be beyond attack, so the raid was intended as a psychological, as well as a physical, assault.|$|R
50|$|After {{a stop at}} Banda on April 25, Triton and Iris {{continued}} on to New Guinea. Prospective sites on Dourga Strait and the Oetanata River proved impractical due to swampy land and reefs. At one point several officers and men were injured in an attack by natives. In early July Lt. Steenboom finally located a suitable site {{at the head of}} a small <b>enclosed</b> <b>bay</b> (promptly named Triton Bay), just east of the modern coastal town of Kaimana.|$|R
50|$|The {{limits of}} {{maritime}} boundaries {{are expressed in}} polylines and in polygon layers of sovereignty and control, calculated from the declaration of a baseline. The conditions under which a state may establish such baseline are described in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). A baseline of a country can be the low water line, a straight baseline (a line that <b>encloses</b> <b>bays,</b> estuaries, inland waters,...) {{or a combination of}} the two.|$|R
50|$|The lake {{is located}} within Øvre Pasvik National Park, just {{northwest}} of the lake Ødevatnet. Ellenvatn is the park's largest lake, located centrally {{in the park and}} is drained from the north through the river Ellenelva. Ellenvatnet is shallow and has a long and crooked shoreline with a large number of small islands. It has two <b>enclosed</b> <b>bays</b> to the south, Parvatn and Skinnposevatn. From Parvatnet a short river leads up to Grenseparvatnet (Kertusjärvi) at the border with Finland.|$|E

50|$|Lemon {{sharks are}} found from New Jersey to {{southern}} Brazil {{in the tropical}} western Atlantic Ocean. They also live {{off the coast of}} west Africa in the southeastern Atlantic. In addition, lemon sharks have been found in the eastern Pacific, from southern Baja California to Ecuador. This species of shark often occupies the subtropical shallow waters of coral reefs, mangroves, <b>enclosed</b> <b>bays,</b> and river mouths; however, lemon sharks have also been found in the open ocean down to depths of 92 m. Although lemon sharks do swim up rivers, they never seem to travel very far into fresh water. They are found in open water primarily during migrations, and tend to stay along the continental and insular shelves for most of their lives.|$|E
5000|$|Designed by Spanish {{engineer}} Agustín de Betancourt with {{a unique}} roof without internal support for 45 m (the building's width), it was erected from 1817 to 1825 by the Russian architect Joseph Bové, who clothed it in its Neoclassical exterior, an order of Roman Doric columns <b>enclosing</b> <b>bays</b> of arch-headed windows in a blind arcade, painted white and cream yellow. The roof, with its internal rafters and beams exposed, rests on external columns of the Manege.|$|R

50|$|Blue Mud Bay is a large, shallow, partly <b>enclosed</b> <b>bay</b> on {{the eastern}} coast of Arnhem Land, in the Northern Territory of Australia, facing Groote Eylandt {{on the western side}} of the Gulf of Carpentaria. It lies 580 km {{east-south-east}} of Darwin in the Arnhem Coast bioregion. Its name was given to a landmark court ruling affirming that the Aboriginal traditional owners of much of the Northern Territory's coastline have exclusive rights over commercial and recreational fishing in tidal waters overlying their land.|$|R

50|$|The Anderson Inlet, {{sometimes}} incorrectly {{referred to}} as Andersons Inlet, is a shallow and dynamic estuary in South Gippsland, Victoria, Australia where the Tarwin River enters Bass Strait. It forms a 2400 ha almost <b>enclosed</b> <b>bay</b> next {{to the town of}} Inverloch, for which it provides a popular and protected beach. At low tide its intertidal mudflats provide important feeding habitat for migratory waders. It is also an important area for recreational fishing. It is named after the Anderson brothers, the first Europeans to settle in the area.|$|R
