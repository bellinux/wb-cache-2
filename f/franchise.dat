40|$|In {{spite of}} its {{considerable}} popularity, multi-unit <b>franchising</b> has been considered an anomaly from an agency theory perspective. This paper addresses this anomaly by attempting a comprehensive agency theoretic explanation of international multi-unit <b>franchising.</b> Although past agency theoretic examinations have mostly focused on single-unit <b>franchising,</b> a closer examination of the international context, which is characterized by significant geographic and cultural distance between franchisors and franchisees, suggests that multi-unit <b>franchising</b> may be more appropriate. This paper examines several agency problems inherent in multi-unit <b>franchising.</b> These include: bonding, adverse selection, information flow, shirking, inefficient risk-bearing, free-riding, and quasi-rent appropriation. Consideration {{of each of these}} problems using agency theory perspective leads to the suggestion that multi-unit <b>franchising</b> might address agency problems better than single-unit <b>franchising</b> in the international context.

40|$|Die vorliegende Masterarbeit hat die Auswirkungen der Prinzipal-Agent-Theorie, sowie der Transaktionskostentheorie auf die Wahl der Organisationsstruktur von internationalen Franchise-Unternehmen untersucht. Die empirische Untersuchung basiert auf den Daten von internationalen Franchise-Unternehmen, die ihren Hauptsitz in acht Ländern, i. e. in den USA und in Europa, haben. Die binäre logistische Regression wurde als Auswertungsinstrument gewählt. Es wurden die Effekte der Theorien auf die Wahl von direktem im Vergleich zu indirektem <b>Franchising</b> untersucht. Indirektes <b>Franchising</b> (i. e. Master <b>Franchising)</b> impliziert niedrige Kontrolle wobei direktes <b>Franchising</b> (i. e. Tochterunternehmen, Joint-Venture-Franchising, Einheits-Franchising und Mehreinheit-Franchising) hohe Kontrolle impliziert. Die empirischen Ergebnisse belegen nur die Hypothese in Bezug auf die Prinzipal-Agent-Theorie und liefern konträre Schlüsse für die Transaktionskostentheorie. Hohe Überwachungskosten auf Grund von Verhaltensunsicherheit erhöhen die Anwendung von indirektem <b>Franchising.</b> Die Hypothesen in Bezug auf die Transaktionskostentheorie konnten nicht belegt werden, weil die Ergebnisse konträr und zum Teil nicht signifikant waren. In this thesis, it was {{examined}} how Agency Theory and Transaction Cost Theory determine {{the choice of}} governance structure of international <b>franchising</b> firms. The empirical investigation was {{based on data from}} international <b>franchising</b> companies whose respective headquarters are located in eight countries, i. e. in the USA and in Europe. Binary logistic regression was used to obtain the empirical results. The different governance structure modes were summarized under direct <b>franchising</b> as opposed to indirect <b>franchising.</b> Indirect <b>franchising</b> (i. e. master <b>franchising)</b> is characterized by low control levels, whereas direct <b>franchising</b> (i. e. wholly-owned subsidiaries, joint-venture <b>franchising,</b> single-unit and multi-unit <b>franchising)</b> is characterized by higher control levels. The empirical results support only the hypothesis for Agency Theory and bring about contradictory findings for Transaction Cost Theory. In conclusion, high monitoring costs owing to behavioral uncertainty increase the use of indirect <b>franchising.</b> The hypotheses with regard to Transaction Cost Theory could not be supported as the results are contradictory and in part not significant. ...|$|R
