The unemployment effect found out by this paper confirms that, as it has been pointed out by most recent developments of human capital literature, the firms incentives to pay for general training depend on the level of wage compression. Notwithstanding it represents an original result as compression in this model doesn’t depend on institutional factors, as usually assumed in the literature, but on the dependence of unskilled wage on regional unemployment. education, training, wage compression, unemployment. ...|$|R

40|$|The European Union {{has stated}} {{interest}} {{in assessing the}} effectiveness and relevance of its messages about the adverse consequences of smoking {{in the context of}} its tobacco control policy. In the absence of disaggregated data on the direct relationship between health information and smoking decisions, we follow Clark et al. (2002) and investigate the impact of health shocks on the probability to quit daily smoking using eight waves of the <b>European</b> Union <b>Community</b> <b>Household</b> <b>Panel</b> (ECHP). Our intention is to assess whether individuals learn from changes in health i. e. successfully update new information about the consequences of tobacco consumption. As self assessed health is subjective and prone to reporting bias, we instrument self assessed health using “objective" health indicators and the socio-demographic variable age; the resulting variable is then used to model continuous and discrete changes in health, termed as health shocks. Estimating a discrete time hazard model with gamma distributed frailty, we find evidence that objective discrete health shocks increase the probability to quit daily smoking. Stratifying by gender reveals that in particular men above 55 quit following a negative health shock while the results for women are not statistically significant. Assuming that the increased hazard rate for men is associated with an increased perceived risk of coronary artery disease, we conclude that specific information about smoking related health shocks are the most effective health warnings.

40|$|Very {{preliminary}} {{first draft}} In {{this article we}} characterize the evolution of inequality in labor income, hourly wages, hours of work and consumption for Spain. We look at both the <b>European</b> <b>Household</b> <b>Community</b> <b>Panel</b> and the Encuesta Continua de Presupuestos Famil-iares. While the first data set allows us to characterize the joint evolution of labor income, wages and hours, the second data set allows us to characterize the joint evolution of labor income and consumption. These statistics are fundamental to calibrate or estimate macroeconomic models with heterogeneous agents and incom-plete markets. Our analysis shows that over the period 1985 - 2000 inequality in individual labor earnings and household income has decreased substantially. How-ever, the observed reduction in inequality in consumption has been much smaller. This suggests that, either the reduction in income inequality has not affected much the sources of permanent differences between individuals and households, or rather that Spanish households {{are very good at}} insuring away permanent shocks to labor earnings.

40|$|Purpose – The primary {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to test whether gender differences in job satisfaction are assignable to variations in labour market and welfare state regimes in the light of gender-related labour market modernization. Design/methodology/approach – Using data derived from the <b>European</b> <b>Household</b> <b>Community</b> <b>Panel</b> (EHCP) and covering 14 member states of the European Union the study constructs a series of summary statistics to lay the foundation for the analysis. An ordinary ordered-probit regression model is employed to test for the (non-) emergence of a gender-job satisfaction paradox. Findings – The results suggest that objective (socio-economic and institutional) determinants of labour market status and subjective (assessed and evaluated) perspectives are mutually complementary. The more restrictive the labour market access and process is for women, the more likely a gender-job satisfaction paradox is to emerge in any country. Equal opportunities for women and men (such as those observed in Scandinavian countries) indicate that the gender-job satisfaction paradox does not appear anymore due to a fading-out process over past decades, which was driven by appropriate institutional labour market interventions. Originality/value – The gender-job satisfaction paradox was confirmed for the UK, whereas little has been done to test this hypothesis on a cross-national basis. This investigation thus fills the gap in the empirical literature...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we characterize, for the period 1985 to 2000, the {{evolution}} of inequality in hourly wages, hours of work, labor earnings, household income and household consumption for Spain. We look at both the Encuesta Continua de Presupuestos Familiares and the <b>European</b> <b>Household</b> <b>Community</b> <b>Panel.</b> Our analysis shows that over the period 1985 - 2000 inequality in individual labor earnings and household income has decreased substantially.

However, the inequality reduction has not been monotonic: after a sharp fall of inequality during the economic expansion between the mid eighties and the early nineties, inequality increased during the recession of 1993.

Denmark, Finland and the Netherlands do not show significant gender-job satisfaction differences. In contrast, in Portugal men are more satisfied with their jobs than women.

As the majority of women are disadvantaged compared to men in the labor market, the findings clearly demonstrate a gender-job satisfaction paradox in these countries.

40|$|In {{this study}} we focus on two issues. First, we {{investigate}} whether the labour market is segmented in various categories, into different clusters. Second, we model labour market outcomes, in terms of contract types held by workers at the different survey years’, {{in order to identify}} those characteristics that are most likely to affect them. To tackle the first question, we use cluster analysis. To analyze empirically the second issue, we use discrete choice models for nominal dependent variables in a panel data setting. More particularly we use a mixed logit that allows for correlations between alternatives over time. The data used are extracted from the waves 1995 - 1999 of the <b>European</b> <b>Household</b> <b>Community</b> <b>panel.</b> We distinguish three job statutes: “permanent contracts ” – PE-, “fixedterm contracts ” – FC- and “other working arrangements ” – OWA- (including casual jobs and the residual category of other working arrangements). While the reference class will be represented by the most “secure” contract (e. g. permanent job), the others will be accordingly those going from the lower level to higher level of stability in the class of temporary contracts. To capture gender differences, the estimations have been carried out separately on the sample of men and women. The results show that important differences exist at cluster level and further across genders. Three clusters have been identified, and the transition rates computed for each cluster show that workers in “low quality employment ” clusters experience higher risk of labour market exclusion.

In this paper we describe the process of collecting validation data and the outcomes of the process. Validation data were obtained from two sources: employers' records and government benefit data from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). The former provided information on occupation and employment status, gross and net pay, membership of company pension schemes and industry sector. The latter provided histories of benefit receipt and tax credits, for example, child, disability, housing and unemployment benefits, pensions and income support. In the survey interview, respondents were asked for written permission both to obtain their DWP records and to contact their employer. They {{were also asked to}} provide information that would facilitate the process of obtaining the validation data: National Insurance number (NINO) and employer contact details. Subsequently, DWP records were extracted using a non-hierarchical matching strategy, based on different combinations of identifying variables obtained in the survey (NINO, sex, date of birth, name and postcode), and a survey of employers was carried out (mail, with telephone follow-up). The representativeness of the validation samples obtained depends on the co-operation of both survey respondents and providers of validation data, as well as errors in the matching process. We report permission rates, proportions providing matching items, match rates for the DWP data and response rates to the employer survey. We identify correlates of these measures of success at each stage of the validation process in terms of substantive characteristics of the survey respondents. Variation by subgroups is identified and implications for the representativeness of the validation sample are discussed. ...|$|R

Our results show that ECHP attrition is characterised by a certain degree of selectivity but only affecting some variables and countries. Different probability models corroborate the existence of a certain non-random attrition. The model chosen to construct the longitudinal weights to correct attrition offers up rather different results than those obtained when Eurostat’s longitudinal weights are used.
