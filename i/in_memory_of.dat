40|$|Abstract Prior {{research}} has shown that <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> feeling good about the self often focus on achievement themes, whereas <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> feeling bad about the self often focus on interpersonal themes. This study examined whether a similar relationship would be evident for imagined future events. Young adults in the United States and Denmark provided memories and imagined future events that are associated with positive or negative self-regard. Across cultures, achievement themes were prominently represented <b>in</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> positive self-regard and interpersonal themes were prominently represented <b>in</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> negative self-regard. <b>In</b> contrast, relationships between the emotional valence and thematic content of imagined future events were weak and inconsistent. Our results raise new questions for the theory that imagined future episodes are constructed primarily from recombinations of past episodes...|$|R
