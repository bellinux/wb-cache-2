5|$|The Japanese Combined Fleet {{was also}} seeking to draw Allied naval forces {{into what was}} hoped to be a decisive battle. Two fleet {{carriers}}— and —and one light carrier——arrived at the main Japanese naval base at Truk Atoll from Japan in early October and joined Shōkaku and Zuikaku. With five carriers fully equipped with air groups, plus their numerous battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, the Japanese Combined Fleet, directed by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, was confident that it could {{make up for the}} defeat at the Battle of Midway. Apart <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> air raids on Henderson Field in October, the Japanese carriers and their supporting warships stayed in the northwestern area of the Solomon Islands, out of the battle for Guadalcanal and waiting for a chance to approach and engage the U.S. carriers. With the Japanese Army's next planned major ground attack on Allied forces on Guadalcanal set for 20 October, Yamamoto's warships began to move towards the southern Solomons to support the offensive and to be ready to engage any Allied (primarily U.S.) ships, especially carriers, that approached to support the Allied defenses on Guadalcanal.|$|E

During the start of the 2009 season Singh announced that he would miss three weeks after undergoing arthroscopic surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his right knee. Singh had a mediocre 2009 season, with no top 5 finishes and ended the year with his lowest ever ranking on the PGA Tour money list in 68th.|$|E

Richard Wheatly resigned from his role with The Local Radio Company on the same day. Wheatly formed a consortium to proceed with a management buyout to purchase Jazz FM.

25|$|Rogers' {{second season}} as Somerset captain, 1951, was more {{difficult}} than the first. The side was dependent for wickets on a trio of spin bowlers, Johnny Lawrence, Ellis Robinson and Horace Hazell, with the last two both past 40. In 1950, runs had come from several team members: in 1951, Maurice Tremlett made more than 2,000 and Harold Gimblett 1,400, {{but no one else}} apart <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> irregular amateurs averaged more than 20. Rogers made only 784 runs in Championship games with a top score of 58, although his season average and total was improved by an unbeaten 107 in 160 minutes against the South African touring team. This was to prove his highest score in first-class cricket. With both batting and bowling inadequacies, Somerset fell back to 14th in the Championship, with only five victories and 15 defeats.|$|E

The mesogenic groups in this phase are titled with respect to the layer normal, but unlike the SC phase the tilt direction is opposite in adjacent layers.

25|$|Following the {{decision}} of the national court a campaign in defense of the house was started. The campaign had been going on ever since the house was sold, but it was only now when facing eviction that the campaign got organized and began focusing on mass-mobilization.

The university most focused on sports provision is Loughborough University. Budding professionals in the traditionally working class team sports of football and rugby league rarely go to university.

40|$|We study {{interactions}} between bright matter-wave solitons which acquire chiral transport dynamics {{due to an}} optically-induced density-dependent gauge potential. Through numerical simulations, {{we find that the}} collision dynamics feature several non-integrable phenomena, from inelastic collisions including population transfer and radiation losses to short-lived bound states and soliton fission. An effective quasi-particle model for the interaction between the solitons is derived by means of a variational approximation, which demonstrates that the inelastic nature of the collision arises <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> the gauge field to velocities of the solitons. In addition, we derive a set of interaction potentials which show that the influence of the gauge field appears as a short-range potential, that can give rise to both attractive and repulsive interactions.
