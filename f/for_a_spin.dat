25|$|An {{important}} {{property of}} the non-radiative transition between 3E and 1A {{is that it is}} stronger for ms = ±1 and weaker for ms = 0. This property results in a very useful manipulation of N-V center, which is called optical spin-polarization. First, an off-resonance excitation which has a higher frequency (typically 2.32 eV (532nbsp&nm)) than the frequencies of all transitions and thus lays in the vibronic bands for all transitions. By using a pulse of this wavelength, people can excite all spin states and create phonons as well. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>spin</b> state with ms = 0, due to conservation of spin in transition, it will be excited to the corresponding ms = 0 state in 3E and then go back to original state. However, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>spin</b> state with ms = ±1 in 3A, after the excitation, it has a relatively high probability to jump to the intermediate state 1A by non-radiative transition and go to the ground state with ms = 0. After sufficient cycles, the state of the N-V center can be regarded as in the ms = 0 state. Such a process can be used in the initialization of quantum state in quantum information processing.|$|E

Leverock claimed one of Canada's wickets as Bermuda won the game by three wickets under the Duckworth-Lewis method. He has since gone onto play for Bermuda in 11 ODIs, {{and picked up the}} first five wicket haul by a Bermudian bowler in ODIs, when he took 5/53 against Kenya which he {{achieved}} by opening the bowling, no mean feat <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>spin</b> bowler.|$|E
25|$|This energy {{function}} only introduces probability biases <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>spin</b> having a value {{and for a}} pair of spins having the same value. Higher order correlations are unconstrained by the multipliers. An activity pattern sampled from this distribution requires the largest number of bits to store in a computer, in the most efficient coding scheme imaginable, as compared with any other distribution with the same average activity and pairwise correlations. This means that Ising models are relevant to any system which is described by bits which are as random as possible, with constraints on the pairwise correlations and the average number of 1s, which frequently occurs in both the physical and social sciences.|$|E

25|$|If the bowler bowls {{without some}} part of the front foot landing either {{grounded}} or in the air behind the popping crease. If the front foot of a bowler lands behind the crease and slides beyond, then it is not a No ball. If the foot lands outside the crease, it is a No ball. It is legal <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>spin</b> bowler, for example, to land with his toe spikes grounded wholly in front of the crease but to have his heel in the air behind that line. The bowler must satisfy the umpire that {{some part of}} the foot lands initially behind -or on- the line, and in big games this question is now subject to minute examination by television replay. Recent practice has been to allow the bowler the benefit of any residual doubt in this judgement.|$|E
25|$|Kyle Busch {{started on}} pole, and he, Matt Kenseth, and Jimmie Johnson took several turns leading {{through the first}} 70 laps as Kasey Kahne, Brad Keselowski, Kurt Busch, Austin Dillon, and others were caught up in early accidents. Joey Logano then took over the lead from Kyle Busch for a few laps, but yielded to Johnson and Kenseth. Meanwhile, Kurt Busch and Keselowski would {{continuously}} bump and race each other very hard because of an incident on pit road several laps before. This would ultimately lead to a caution for Ricky Stenhouse, Jr. running up into the wall after checking up for the ongoing battle between Busch and Keselowski. Kenseth retook the lead during pit stops under the caution, but quickly yielded to Logano after the restart. After another caution and restart, Johnson took over from Logano. Johnson, Logano, Hamlin, and Kenseth all faded soon after, and after lap 165, Greg Biffle, Marcos Ambrose, and A. J. Allmendinger became the new top-three. After another caution <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>spin</b> by Casey Mears, Ambrose won the race off of pit road to become the new leader. Kenseth and Johnson would get by Ambrose after several laps, but another caution would wave after Jamie McMurray got bumped into the wall by Dale Earnhardt, Jr.. After the restart, Kenseth would lose the lead to Johnson, then fade back to tenth after getting stuck on the outside.|$|E

2500|$|A {{spinning}} charge {{generates a}} magnetic field that results in a magnetic moment proportional to the spin. In {{the presence of an}} external magnetic field, two spin states exist (<b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>spin</b> 1/2 nucleus): one spin up and one spin down, where one aligns with the magnetic field and the other opposes it. The difference in energy (ΔE) between the two spin states increases as the strength of the field increases, but this difference is usually very small, leading to the requirement for strong NMR magnets [...] (1-20 T for modern NMR instruments). [...] Irradiation of the sample with energy corresponding to the exact spin state separation of a specific set of nuclei will cause excitation of those set of nuclei in the lower energy state to the higher energy state.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We study {{entanglement}} entropy in two-dimensional conformal field theories with a gravitational anomaly. In theories with gravity duals, this anomaly is holographically {{represented by}} a gravitational Chern-Simons term in the bulk action. We show that the anomaly broadens the Ryu-Takayanagi minimal worldline into a ribbon, and that the anomalous contribution to the CFT entanglement entropy is given by the twist in this ribbon. The entanglement functional may also be interpreted as the worldline action <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>spinning</b> particle — that is, an anyon — in three-dimensional curved spacetime. We demonstrate that the minimization of this action results in the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations of motion <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>spinning</b> particle in three dimensions.
