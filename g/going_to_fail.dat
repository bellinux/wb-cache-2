5|$|Francis Nicholson and Samuel Vetch {{organized}} {{an ambitious}} assault against New France in 1709, with some financial and logistical {{support from the}} queen. The plan involved an overland assault on Montreal via Lake Champlain and a sea-based assault by naval forces against Quebec. The land expedition reached {{the southern end of}} Lake Champlain, but it was called off when the promised naval support never materialized for the attack on Quebec. (Those forces were diverted to support Portugal.) The Iroquois had made vague promises of support for this effort, but successfully delayed sending support until it seemed clear that the expedition was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fail.</b> After this failure, Nicholson and Schuyler traveled to London accompanied by King Hendrick and other sachems to arouse interest in the North American frontier war. The Indian delegation caused a sensation in London, and Queen Anne granted them an audience. Nicholson and Schuyler were successful in their endeavor: the queen gave support for Nicholson's successful capture of Port Royal in 1710. With that success under his belt, Nicholson again returned to England and gained support for a renewed attempt on Quebec in 1711.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} from World War I, Crosby attended Harvard {{in the spring}} of 1919 under an accelerated program for veterans. He took 19 courses, six in French (which he read and spoke fluently) and six in English literature. The remainder of his courses were in fine arts, music, Spanish, and social ethics. Taking his studies very lightly, he thought he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fail,</b> and paid a knowledgeable man who was familiar with what questions would be asked on the exams to tutor him. He graduated with a BA in 1921.|$|E
25|$|In 1877, Patterson was criminally {{prosecuted for}} defrauding depositors, {{including}} {{encouraging people to}} deposit money when he knew {{that they would not}} be repaid. Foolishly, Patterson did not prepare for trial, hiring a lawyer at the last minute. Hungerford was the first witness to testify about the bank's beginnings. Later testimony showed that Patterson knew his bank was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fail</b> for the past five years. According to an auditor's report, in January 23, 1875, Patterson's bank had liabilities of $96,669.89, but only $5,931.30 of available resources and $36,498.47 of contingent resources, i.e., money in Patterson's individual account, leaving an overall shortage of $54,240.12. Patterson claimed that he was actually solvent at all times because bank investments in real estate covered any alleged shortages. The presiding judge did not buy his story and found him guilty of fraud.|$|E
50|$|The Great Powers, {{most notably}} France and Austria-Hungary, {{reacted to the}} {{formation}} of these alliances by trying to dissuade the League from <b>going</b> <b>to</b> war, but <b>failed.</b> In late September, both the League and the Ottoman Empire mobilized their armies. Montenegro was the first to declare war, on 25 September (O.S.)/8 October. After issuing an impossible ultimatum to the Porte on 13 October, Bulgaria, Serbia and Greece declared war on the Empire on 17 October. The declarations of war attracted a large number of war correspondents. An estimated 200-300 journalists from around the world covered the war in the Balkans in November 1912.|$|R
50|$|Thurber's time in {{the house}} was challenging, {{particularly}} because of his experience at the university. Due to his physical limitations, including bad eyesight, he performed poorly at required gym classes and military drills. He was not invited to join a fraternity and, as such, found few social connections. Though he registered for classes in his sophomore year, 1914-1915, he mostly stopped <b>going</b> <b>to</b> classes and <b>failed</b> them all. Eventually, he befriended former child star Elliott Nugent, who helped Thurber become more outgoing. He eventually became co-editor of the campus newspaper and contributed to the humor magazine before becoming its editor.|$|R
50|$|In March 1910 an Albanian insurrection {{broke out}} in Kosovo. In August Montenegro {{followed}} Bulgaria's precedent by becoming a kingdom. In 1911 Italy launched an invasion of Tripolitania, which was quickly followed by the occupation of the Dodecanese Islands. The Italians' decisive military victories over the Ottoman Empire greatly influenced the Balkan states to prepare for war against Turkey. Thus, {{in the spring of}} 1912 consultations among the various Christian Balkan nations resulted in a network of military alliances that became known as the Balkan League. The Great Powers, most notably France and Austria-Hungary, reacted to this diplomatic sensation by trying to dissuade the League from <b>going</b> <b>to</b> war, but <b>failed.</b>|$|R
500|$|Gehry {{publicly}} blamed Dworsky: [...] "The executive architect {{was incapable}} of doing drawings that had this complexity. We helped select that firm. I went to Daniel, supposedly a friend, and I said, 'This is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fail</b> and {{we now have the}} capability to do it, so let us ghost-write it.'" [...] Dworsky refused. Gehry was also quoted in the Los Angeles Times as saying: [...] "We had the wrong executive architect doing the drawings. I helped pick him, I'm partly responsible. It brought us to a stop."" [...] Gehry told Los Angeles magazine in 1996 that he [...] "no longer speaks to his former friend (Dworsky)". Gehry continued his public attacks on Dworsky: [...] "He (Dworsky) made a lot of money. He begged me for the job. I'd like to shoot him." ...|$|E
500|$|Both {{managers}} {{approached the}} match {{with a view}} to win, in spite of the Shield's friendly feel. Arsenal manager George Graham opined [...] "Winning is a good habit, so why not start early?" [...] Graham lambasted those who found his team's playing style tedious: [...] "The criticism that we don't pass the ball and we don't have flair is overdone. We won two championships and in the second lost one game out of 38." [...] However, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said [...] "Winning means keeping your job, and it can be a delicate situation. But I tell myself I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fail</b> in this game." [...] Ferguson spoke in glowing terms of new signing Roy Keane, a midfielder who gave United [...] "unbelievable options, a real edge to the squad".|$|E
500|$|The largest known {{group of}} Robinsons was {{composed}} of approximately 37 people {{under the leadership of}} Roman Fiszer and medical doctors, Dr. Beer and Prof. Henryk Beck. Beck was the director of a makeshift insurgent hospital during the uprising. As {{it became clear that the}} insurrection was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fail,</b> he and Cpt. Władysław Kowalski, a Home Army soldier who also decided to stay, converted two adjacent basements into a well-equipped and -supplied hiding place. The group stockpiled water, coffee, medicines, fuel, and various foodstuffs. [...] Additionally, Beck kept a set of watercolors, crayons, ink, and paper, which he used to illustrate life in the bunker. As some of the members had fought in the uprising, the group also possessed a small cache of weapons, unusual for Robinsons. A dog, Bunkierek ("bunker puppy"), also stayed with them and, according to the memoirs, did not bark or make any noise.|$|E

5000|$|The 881 was {{the last}} F1 car in which Zakspeed used their own engines which were rated at about [...] for the season. While this made the engine {{one of the most}} {{powerful}} in the field, being only about 10 bhp shy of both the Honda and Ferrari V6 engines, and around the same as the other straight 4 turbo in the field, the Megatrons used by Arrows, that is where the similarities ended. Honda powered McLaren to 15 wins and 15 pole positions during the season, with the other win and pole <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Ferrari. Ghinzani <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> qualify on seven occasions while Schneider <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> qualify ten times. Something that did not help the team's cause was the weight of the car. The 881 weighed in at 560 kg, this was around 20 kg heavier than the McLaren MP4/4, Ferrari F1/87/88C and the Honda powered Lotus 100T.|$|R

500|$|Work at {{the pump}} {{stations}} and marine terminal, which had not stopped during the winter, continued throughout the 1976 construction season. Pump Station 6, {{just south of the}} Yukon River, had to be redesigned after excavation revealed ice-rich permafrost below the site. Five pump stations needed at startup (when throughput was lower) received their pumps, turbines, and piping. As they were completed, the pump stations received hydrostatic testing, in which portions of pipe were filled with water and subjected to pressures in excess of the eventual operating conditions. Following this testing, the initial five pump stations were disconnected from the main pipeline and had oil run through them on a continuous loop. [...] "It's very similar to your new automobile," [...] one worker said. [...] "You drive it around for ten days so that any components that are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fail</b> are given time to fail." [...] Work on additional pump stations, which would not be needed until the pipeline was brought to full capacity, was not pressed forward.|$|E
2500|$|Because parkour {{philosophy}} is about learning to control oneself in {{interaction with the}} environment, leading parkour experts tend to view physical injury as a deviation from true parkour. Daniel Ilabaca, co-founder of the World Parkour and Freerunning Federation, said [...] "Thinking you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fail</b> at something gives you {{a higher risk of}} doing just that. Committing to something you're thinking or knowing you will land gives you a higher chance of landing or completing the task." [...] There is growing evidence that parkour techniques can reduce injury rates when landing, compared to traditional sport techniques.|$|E

So many businesses had folded in that particular location that the Hooters founders built a small [...] "graveyard" [...] at the front door for each that had come and gone before them. The first restaurant opened its doors on October 4, 1983, in Clearwater. [...] This original location was decorated with memorabilia from Waverly, Iowa, hometown to some of the original Hooters 6.|$|E
500|$|During the October 2011, provincial election, Dunderdale said [...] "We've got {{too many}} people chasing too few fish, and these plants are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{collapse}} and <b>fail</b> because they're not on sound economic models". She said there was overcapacity in the fishing industry and that fish processing plants would need to close. Minister Jackman, who represents a district that relies heavily on the fishing industry, continued to face much criticism for his performance in the fisheries portfolio and was re-elected by just 40 votes. The day after winning a majority government, Dunderdale stated {{in an interview that}} tough decisions were looming in the industry. She again stated there was overcapacity and structural problems in the fishery and that her government was ready to make the tough decisions that were long overdue. Dunderdale swore in her new cabinet weeks after the election and shuffled Jackman to the Department to Education, Darin King succeeded him as the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture.|$|R
40|$|Politeness becomes {{important}} in speech when what {{is about to}} be said has the potential to threaten the Hearer’s face. Often in communication it is necessary to say something that would threaten the other person’s face. In other words, Face Threatening Acts (FTA) are committed when the speech behavior is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> po- tentially <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> meet the Hearer’s positive or negative face needs. Doing FTA is a normal speech behavior and is not seen as a problem in itself. The problem arises when the FTA <b>fails</b> <b>to</b> be executed appropriately in order to mitigate potential problems that could result from doing the FTA. Prostitutes are considered as marginalized people, and then women as sub group tend to speak more politely. There are many subordinate groups which have their own set of communication rules, apart from the universal rules. There are different levels of required polite- ness and different ways of being polite, but all people have the need to be appreci- ated and protected, which Brown and Levinson call face needs. This study found interesting features in the way the subjects manipulate and manage their interac- tions in order to get their intended message across employed six positive and seven negative politeness strategies.   Key words: FTA, Indirectness, Positive and Negative politeness...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} survive in the {{increasingly}} customer-oriented marketplace, continuous quality improvement marks the fastest growing quality organization’s success. In recent years, attention has been focused on intelligent systems which have shown great promise in supporting quality control. However, {{only a small number of}} the currently used systems are reported to be operating effectively because they are designed to maintain a quality level within the specified process, rather than to focus on cooperation within the production workflow. This paper proposes an intelligent system with a newly designed algorithm and the universal process data exchange standard to overcome the challenges of demanding customers who seek high-quality and low-cost products. The intelligent quality management system is equipped with the ‘‘distributed process mining” feature to provide all levels of employees with the ability to understand the relationships between processes, especially when any aspect of the process is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> degrade or <b>fail.</b> An example of generalized fuzzy association rules are applied in manufacturing sector to demonstrate how the proposed iterative process mining algorithm finds the relationships between distributed process parameters and the presence of quality problems...|$|R
