5|$|In Delaware, the {{flooding}} damaged numerous houses, including 194 in the Glenville area. The rapid flooding trapped numerous people <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>cars</b> and homes, forcing {{at least one}} rescue by helicopter. Those people were evacuated to nearby schools. The severe flooding washed out most of a bridge in Hockessin and destroyed 6 Wilmington & Western Railroad bridges, causing about $5million (2003USD, $5.5million 2006USD) in damage. The railroad bridges were still being rebuilt as of 2006. Greenbank Mill, a historic gristmill complex, saw $450,000 in damage. Damage in Delaware totaled to $16.1million (2003USD, $17.5million 2006USD).|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Saipan, 50 power lines, 20 transformers, and 6 {{power poles}} were damaged or destroyed, leaving 25{{percent of the}} islands' {{residents}} without power and $300,000 in damages. An estimated 90 percent of the banana trees were knocked down, contributing to the $518,000 in crop losses. Property losses on the two islands was estimated at $1.6million. On the islands of Alamagan, Pagan, and Agrihan all private homes, a total of six, were destroyed, the food stores and crops were lost, and the water supply was contaminated. The main public facility, which {{was used as a}} storm shelter on Alamagan, sustained heavy damage. Damages from the three islands amounted to $500,000. The following day, five people went out kayaking however, the rough seas overturned the kayaks and all five drowned. Numerous water rescues on jet skis had to be made as residents became stranded <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>cars</b> after driving into flooded roads. Damages throughout the islands amounted to $11.2million.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{hurricane}} made landfall, Mexico's natural disaster fund provided $1.45 million in aid to repair pipelines, highways, and buildings. The United Methodist Committee on Relief distributed food baskets to 720 survivors and provided 180 families with wood for rebuilding their homes. In addition, the Civil Protection Agency in Baja California, the Baja bush Pilots, and the Mexican Red Cross asked for donations of such as utensils, flashlights, lanterns, batteries, clothing, and light bedding. Following the hurricane, a riot in Santa Rosalía broke out {{due to lack of}} water. There was also a lack for shelter, as such this left many people sleeping <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>cars.</b> Within a week, the Mexican government assessed the damage form the hurricane, with 15 of them begin sent to Santa Rosalía and shortly thereafter, the Mexican Red Cross sent out relief efforts to the devastated area, especially in Santa Rosalía3. A total of 4,460 food kits were sent, 1,152 hygiene kits, 765 cleaning kits, 225 children's kits, and 181 kitchen kits.|$|E

25|$|By the 1960s, American {{society had}} become highly motorized, {{largely due to}} the 1956 Federal Highway Act passed by President Dwight Eisenhower and {{inspired}} by the German Autobahn, as well as the impressive growth rates of American automobile manufacturers at the time. Due to the extensive use of cars at the time, hamburgers were often served at drive-ins, often by waiters known as carhops. Drive-in restaurants first appeared in the United States in the early 1930s, and gradually become a common sight across the country. The ability to serve hamburgers to customers <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>cars</b> was seen as a business opportunity by countless fast-food chains, especially McDonald's. The popularity of the hamburger grew rapidly among the American population during this period, and statistics indicate that the average American was eating three burgers per week.|$|E

25|$|The {{price of}} Neodymium {{went through a}} price bubble due to Chinese export {{restriction}} in 2010–11, rising from $50/kg {{at the start of}} 2010 to $500/kg by the summer of 2011. This resulted in 'demand destruction' as many producers quickly turned to substituting induction motors <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>cars</b> to defend their production line. This was in spite of such motors inferior 'power to weight' ratio attributes significantly impacting all but the most powerful (energy guzzling) motor sizes, e.g. those used in the Tesla. As of April 2014 there are other non-Chinese producers of Neodymium and its price/kg is not much more than it was in 2010. Cutting edge U.K. motors that are now being produced are using Neodymium Permanent Magnet technology. As security of supply returns, it is certain that there will accordingly be a return to superior motor designs that NdFeB Permanent Magnets enable.|$|E

25|$|After the {{remainder}} of Riis Park was relinquished by the Navy, in fall 1930 Queens Parks Commissioner Albert C. Benninger proposed {{the construction of a}} bathing pavilion at Jacob Riis Park. Benninger had been inspired by the design of the bathhouse at Jones Beach State Park, completed in August 1929 by then-Long Island Parks Commissioner Robert Moses. Prior to this, beach-goers were forced to change their clothes <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>cars.</b> The designs were prepared by architect John L. Plock in November 1930. The project was approved by the mayor's office in February 1931. The foundation of the building was completed in August 1931. Contracts were let for building construction in September 1931. Later that month, Benninger requested an additional $105,000 for the project from the New York City Board of Estimate, on top of the initial $425,000 appropriated. Construction began on November 23, 1931. The bathhouse was opened on August 6, 1932. At the time, it was only 60 percent completed. Additional work was completed in May 1933, including lockers, the restaurant, and the solarium. The solarium was expected to be the largest in the world at the time. A seawall running in front of the bathhouse along the beach and parking facilities for 5,000 cars were also completed by 1933.|$|E
25|$|The North Hollywood shootout was {{an armed}} {{confrontation}} between two heavily armed and armored bank robbers, Larry Eugene Phillips, Jr. and Emil Matasareanu, and both SWAT and patrol officers in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California on February 28, 1997. It began when responding North Hollywood Division patrol officers engaged Phillips and Matasareanu leaving a bank {{which the two}} men had just robbed. Eleven officers and seven civilians sustained injuries before both robbers were killed. Phillips and Matasareanu had robbed several banks prior to their attempt in North Hollywood and were notorious for their heavy armament, which included automatic rifles. LAPD patrol officers, like most at the time, were typically armed with a 9mm Beretta on their person, with a 12-gauge shotgun available <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>cars</b> (only SWAT officers were regularly equipped with automatic weapons). Phillips and Matasareanu carried fully automatic AK-47 rifles, with ammunition capable of penetrating regular police body armor, and wore full body armor of their own. Since most handgun calibers cannot penetrate body armor, patrol officers had a significant disadvantage until LAPD SWAT arrived with equivalent firepower and body armor; they also appropriated several semi-automatic rifles from a nearby firearms dealer to help even the odds, though by the time this began to happen, SWAT had already arrived. The incident sparked debate on the appropriate firepower for patrol officers to have available in similar situations in the future.|$|E
