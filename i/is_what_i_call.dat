500|$|Arbitration Committee member Roger Davies {{wrote the}} {{majority}} of the decision in the Scientology case. Davies commented in an interview with The New York Times, [...] "It was obvious that this case was going to be controversial pretty much from the start. What we have done is we've really tried {{to make sure that we}} have not directed our fire at anyone in particular." [...] He noted there was a recurring pattern of disputed editing on controversial topics, [...] "One of the problems we keep bumping into <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> core belief issues — politics, religion, nationalism. Fringe faiths, fringe nationalities." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{critically}} panned Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Bay decided {{to remove the}} characters called the Twins entirely from Dark of the Moon: [...] "This one really builds to a final crescendo. It's not three multiple endings. One thing we're getting rid of <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> the dorky comedy. [...] basically gone." [...] Due to fan rumors that the Twins would actually be in the film, the director made a public $25,000 [...] "bet" [...] that the Twins would not be seen in Dark of the Moon. However they were briefly seen in the N.E.S.T headquarters in their vehicle modes in the film.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Aguilera compares {{her love}} to office equipment, from paperclips to rubber-bands, {{as a metaphor}} for a relationship. The lyric [...] "A rubber band <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> your love for me, cause it comes and goes and pins me like a trampoline" [...] was spoken by Aguilera at the beginning. The part [...] "If I was a ruler I'd try to set you straight, but your love is like a sharpener, it really grates" [...] was praised by several critics, while the lines [...] "A rubber band was an analogy, you can even say it's a metaphor" [...] were {{described}} by others as unnecessary, with Becky Bain for Idolator calling it [...] "dumber-than-dumb". Toward the closing moments, she sings, [...] "Paper clips they couldn't even hold us together... when your love hits, it sticks me like a stapler." ...|$|E

2500|$|On January 20, 2012 Evans was {{inducted}} into the NASCAR HOF, during which Darrell Waltrip said to the Evan's family during his acceptance speech, [...] "You know Richie Evans I want to congratulate the Richie Evans Family, great job tonight.

2500|$|In {{the early}} days, {{communal}} meetings {{were limited to}} practical matters, but in the 1920s and 1930s, they became more informal. Instead of meeting in the dining room, the group would sit around a campfire. Rather than reading minutes, the session would begin with a group dance. Remembering her youth on a kibbutz {{on the shores of}} the Kinneret, one woman said: [...] "Oh, how beautiful it was when we all took part in the discussions, [...] nights of searching for one another—that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> those hallowed nights. During the moments of silence, {{it seemed to me that}} from each heart a spark would burst forth, and the sparks would unite in one great flame penetrating the heavens.... At the center of our camp a fire burns, and under the weight of the hora the earth groans a rhythmic groan, accompanied by wild songs".|$|E
2500|$|When I have {{a mental}} {{image of a}} triangle, for example, I don't just {{understand}} that it is a figure bounded by three lines; I also [...] "look at" [...] the lines as though they were present to my mind's eye. [...] And this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> having a mental image. When I want to think of a chiliagon, I {{understand that it is}} a figure with a thousand sides as well as I understand that a triangle is a figure with three, but I can't imagine its sides or [...] "look" [...] at them as though they were present (...) Thus I observe that a special effort of mind is necessary to the act of imagination, which is not required to conceiving or understanding (ad intelligendum); and this special exertion of mind clearly shows the difference between imagination and pure intellection (imaginatio et intellectio pura). (Descartes, Meditation VI: On the Existence of Material Objects and the Real Distinction of Mind from Body).|$|E

2500|$|While {{they use}} the same {{software}} that is employed for intensively interactive gaming environments, the works offer the viewer no freedom of movement, and generally feature a slow camera path that orbits a silent, isolated scene. In relation to this movement, Gerrard says that his understanding of this medium is 'profoundly orbital. The works stage a world, in which certain set of behaviors {{have been put in}} motion. One of them <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> an orbital camera, a camera that moves, at walking pace, around the scene – the human presence: being there, the witness. And then of course you have the orbit of the year which is linked to the real and which forbids an easy, instant consumption of the scene, because it takes a full year to unfold in full. But then, crucially, this world, this reality, consists of one moment in time. Not an instantaneous moment, but the time during which I documented the scene' ...|$|E
2500|$|Above all, Debussy was {{inspired}} by nature and the impression it made on the mind, making a pantheistic profession of faith when he called [...] "mysterious Nature" [...] his religion. 'I do not practice religion {{in accordance with the}} sacred rites. I have made mysterious Nature my religion. I do not believe that a man is any nearer to God for being clad in priestly garments, nor that one place in a town is better adapted to meditation than another. When I gaze at a sunset sky and spend hours contemplating its marvellous ever-changing beauty, an extraordinary emotion overwhelms me. Nature in all its vastness is truthfully reflected in my sincere though feeble soul. Around me are the trees stretching up their branches to the skies, the perfumed flowers gladdening the meadow, the gentle grass-carpeted earth, ... and my hands unconsciously assume an attitude of adoration. ...

5000|$|The {{station was}} {{ground-breaking}} for UK pirate radio, in that unlike its major rival Radio Caroline it used a tight American top-40 format.
