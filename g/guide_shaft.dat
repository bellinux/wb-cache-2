Detachment of flavouring powders from products during handling and production stages can lead to substantial financial losses for the industry, in terms of variable flavour performance and extended cleaning down time of fugitive particle build-up on process equipment. Understanding the adhesion strength of applied bulk particulates used for flavouring formulations will help analysts to evaluate the efficiency of coating processes and potentially enable them to assess the adhesion strength of newly formulated flavouring powder prior to commitment to full scale plant trials. A rapid prototype of a novel adhesion tester has been designed and constructed.

40|$|Flexible {{endoscopes}} (long, slender, flexible instruments with {{a camera}} and light at the distal end, having working channels to introduce flexible instruments) are used for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions inside the human digestive system and inside the abdomen. Though used for their flexibility, the flexibility of these instruments causes several difficulties during insertion and use. During insertion, flexible endoscopes can buckle and loop, which may hamper full insertion into the patient’s body. During therapeutic interventions, the flexible endoscope fails to provide stability for surgical instruments that are introduced through the flexible endoscope. In this thesis, firstly, the fundamental mechanical causes of the difficulties that accompany the use of flexible endoscopes are analysed. Next, an extensive, categorizing review explores the available and potentially suitable solutions to causes of the flexibility-induced difficulties in flexible endoscopy. The review suggests that passive guiding of the flexible endoscope <b>shaft</b> using <b>guides</b> with rigidity control is the most feasible solution. Three potentially suitable rigidity control concepts are selected and further investigated to quantitatively and qualitatively predict the maximally achievable flexural rigidity of these rigidity control mechanisms. The first investigated rigidity control mechanism (“Vacu-SL” mechanism) utilizes the flexural rigidity increase that is achieved by vacuuming foil tubes filled with small particles. The thesis proceeds with experiments {{on the influence of}} particle hardness, size, and shape on the flexural rigidity of vacuumed foil tubes filled with these particles. The experiments showed that the flexural rigidity increases with the hardness and irregularity of the particles and that there may be an optimal particle size in the low particle diameter region. Next, a mechanism using friction between a rubber tube, stainless steel cables, and a stainless steel spring (“FORGUIDE mechanism”) is presented, as well as a mathematical model predicting the maximally achievable flexural rigidity of that mechanism. The results of that chapter suggest that there is great potential for improvement of the FORGUIDE mechanism and that this mechanism may very well provide sufficient support for flexible endoscopes. A chapter on the static friction between several kinds of rubber and several types of stainless steel cables aids to advise on how the flexural rigidity of the friction-based FORGUIDE mechanism can be increased by properly choosing the materials of the tube, cables, and spring. The third rigidity control mechanism (“PlastoLock” mechanism) changes rigidity by heating and cooling a lactide-based polymer through its glass-transition. A feasibility study shows the great potential of this concept in terms of achievable flexural rigidity, miniaturization, and simplicity. Finally, the thesis presents a force analysis and a number of functional design considerations that should guide the further design {{of a new generation of}} flexible endoscopes with passively <b>guided</b> <b>shafts.</b> The discussion of the thesis advises on what rigidity control mechanisms are most likely to provide a proper solution for what application areas, and on what steps should be taken next to finally obtain a good solution to the current flexibility-induced difficulties in flexible endoscopy. It is concluded that the FORGUIDE mechanism and the PlastoLock mechanism are most suitable for application in flexible endoscopes for the gastrointestinal tract. These mechanisms are simple, provide high flexural rigidity (especially when considering their size), and may be applied in a very broad range of applications. Many improvements in existing applications and a broadening of the diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities in gastrointestinal health care may be achieved by further developing the investigated rigidity control mechanisms into fully functional guided instruments.

However, control of the conventional endoscope and multiple instruments is difficult. Robotic assistance could provide a solution and better control for a single operator. A novel platform should also enable interventions in areas that are currently difficult to reach. This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of a robotic platform that guides a conventional endoscope through the large bowel. Methods In this feasibility study, adult patients scheduled for routine diagnostic colonoscopy were included. The endoscope was introduced using a robotic add-on to provide tip bending and air/water actuation. The endoscopist directly controlled the scope shaft. Upon cecal intubation, the add-on was detached and the procedure continued using conventional control. Primary evaluation parameters were the number of serious adverse events and the percentage of successful cecal intubations. Results The procedure was performed in 22 consecutive patients who all gave informed consent. There were no serious adverse events. Cecal intubation was successful in 15 patients (68 %) using the robotic add-on. Six cases were completed after conversion to conventional control: 3 cases were converted to pass sharp angulation in the flexures and 3 cases were converted after technical difficulties. One case was not successful with either technique due to severe diverticulosis.

Observou-se também a superficialidade do discurso dos discentes no que diz respeito à integralidade, e à atenção básica como campo possível de prática para a fisioterapia. Estes dados coadunam com os obtidos nas entrevistas com os fisioterapeutas, onde foi possível perceber a deficiência na formação para o SUS e principalmente para a atuação na atenção básica, sendo necessária a formação em serviço para apropriação do tema integralidade.

In order to reformulate the practices of these professionals and considering the key role of the Unified Health System (SUS) in ordination of human resources {{in the area of}} health, the National Curricular Guidelines guided changes for reorganization of the curricula of these professionals with emphasis on completeness of attention. This work is a joint study, whose goal is to identify in the formative process of graduation in Physical Therapy the existence of components that lead to the integrality of health assistance. Students participated {{in the study of the}} physiotherapy course of three institutions of Higher Education of the Federal District (DF) and physiotherapists from the Secretary of State for Health of the DF (SES-DF). The data were collected in four steps. In the first step, a survey was conducted of the distribution of jobs occupied by physiotherapists inserted in the public health network of the DF; in the second, documentary analysis of the Pedagogical Projects of Curse (PPC) of the three participating IHEs. In the third, was applied the technique of focus groups with students of physiotherapy (32 in total) in each HEI; In the fourth, there was the realization of semi-structured interviews with seven physiotherapists of SES-DF. It is worth noting that the principle of completeness as well as the biomedical model guided the discussion of this work. It was observed that there is a predominance in occupation of jobs by physiotherapists in medium and high complexity services and that, in spite of the PPC submit great part of its content in accordance with the National Curricular Guidelines of Physiotherapy (NFCD), the integrality stands out not as <b>guiding</b> <b>shaft,</b> the basic attention is still underutilized and the teaching-learning methodology remains based on traditional model. It was also observed the superficiality of the discourse of the learners on the completeness, and the basic attention as possible field of practice for physical therapy. These data are consistent with those obtained in the interviews with the physiotherapists, where it was possible to realize the deficiency in training for the SUS and mainly for actuation in basic care, being required in-service training for ownership of the topic completeness. It is concluded that the gaps left by traditional training received by physiotherapists interviewed were not fulfilled by training provided to students of today. This leads us to believe that the education in physiotherapy continues under the strong influence of the biomedical model and that, despite the guidance of NFCD, the changes in education has still not been achieved...|$|R
40|$|The mine in Renström {{is owned}} by Boliden and was built in 1952. The steel tower in the {{concrete}} tower is now rusting away and Knightec has been commissioned to construct a new steel tower and replace it. In order to do that, new calculations {{has to be done}} on what the steel tower has to hold for, and that is presented in this report. In case of an erasure, the chute not breaking normally, it will rise up too high in the shaft. Then the emergency break will cut of the engine and the chute will wedge around the <b>guides</b> in the <b>shaft,</b> break and stop. In case of an erasure the guide will be affected by normal forces of 401 kN. The forces of friction of 40 kN, when the coefficient of friction is 0. 01, are transferred to the steel tower and will dislocate the horizontal IPE 160 beams upwards at the most 7. 30 mm. Therefore the forces of friction will be transferred to the vertical beams as pressure forces of 40 kN. As this report concludes there’s no risk that the beams will crack based on this design. The normal forces that occur are at the most 401 kN. After this the break profile will deform plastically and thus the normal force will not get bigger. The force of friction which is transferred to the guide is totally depending on the coefficient of friction. Research has provided that the coefficient of friction should be between 0. 09 - 0. 18. After deliberation with material producers and Knightec, a coefficient of friction of 0. 10 has been used, but a comparison both up and down has been made to see the consequences. If the coefficient of friction is too high it can be concluded that the forces on the guide will be very big and the consequences can be that the guide will come apart and the wire can break. If it is like this report shows that the forces of friction are not too big, then the guides will hold and the steel tower will not be significantly affected.
