50|$|For the {{coincidence}} to occur, all three rotors {{must be in}} sync. If they are not, then the plaintext would be randomly scrambled and the language properties would not show through. Looking at the region where {{the coincidence}} occurs, some observations can be made. If rotor I <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right,</b> then <b>the</b> middle rotor never matches and the index of coincidence would not indicate a coincidence. If rotor II <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right,</b> then <b>the</b> middle rotor would also never match. Rotor III shows complete agreement. Consequently, the rightmost rotor would be rotor III.|$|R
