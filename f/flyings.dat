50|$|Two Australian <b>flying</b> fox {{species have}} {{reportedly}} {{been affected by}} extreme heat events: the grey-headed <b>flying</b> fox (Pteropus poliocephalus) and the black <b>flying</b> fox (P. alecto). Where mixed-species colonies are affected the black <b>flying</b> fox suffers substantially higher mortality than the grey-headed <b>flying</b> fox. However, summer temperatures are more extreme {{within the range of}} the grey-headed <b>flying</b> fox than within the range of the black flying-fox, and therefore the actual total number of casualties is much higher among grey-headed <b>flying</b> foxes than black <b>flying</b> foxes.|$|R

As a 16-year-old high school student, Betsy Boze (Betsy Vogel), an environmental advocate and social activist that enjoyed sewing costumes and unique gifts, made a 3 x 5 foot green and white [...] "theta" [...] ecology flag to commemorate the first Earth Day. Initially denied permission to fly the flag at C.E.

He {{went to work in}} 1935 for Austin Airways, a charter service and <b>flyings</b> school at Ramsey Lake, becoming a licensed pilot in March 1938. Commonly known as [...] "Rusty", Blakey flew for almost 50 years, with over 30,000 hours in single-engine aircraft, without mechanical aid. Over a third of those hours were logged in Austin Airway's Noorduyn Norseman, CF-BSC. He continued piloting until October 10, 1986, the day before he died.|$|E
40|$|Emerging laser {{technologies}} are quickly gaining acceptance {{in the industrial}} workplace. Besides the risk of human exposure, one safety concern with the more intense lasers {{is the potential for}} ignition of flammable gases, vapors, dusts, fibers, or <b>flyings</b> often found in hazardous (classified) industrial settings. In underground coal mines, lasers are being considered for remote measurement of explosive methane gas. Current federal safety regulations for underground mines contain no specific guidance for evaluating the safety of optoelectronic components such as diode lasers. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health is conducting research to help provide a scientific basis for developing appropriate safety guidelines for optical equipment in the presence of flammable methane gas and/or coal dust. One phase of the study is an experimental evaluation of methane-air ignition by laser heated small particles. Minimum observed igniting powers for laser energy delivered by 200 -, 400 -, and 800 -um core diameter fiber optic cables and directed onto selected targets in methane-air atmospheres were 0. 6, L l, and 2. 2 W, respectively. Comparisons are made with other ignition phenomena, including heated wires...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{intends to}} provide a {{description}} of the LAREDO tool including architecture, design choices and mathematical formulations. The goal of LAREDO, which is a six DOF simulator developed under Matlab/Simulink-based environment, is to reproduce the Rendezvous and Docking (RvD) sequences applicable to different exploration mission-scenarios and to provide detailed analysis of formation <b>flyings</b> (FF) satellite constellations using highly coupled GNC algorithms, which integrate attitude, navigation and maneuvers. Among those, it is possible to select: Earth, Moon, Mars, Venus, Deimos, Triton and Europa as final destination. Within the LAREDO simulator a launching optimization module is implemented to optimize the launching phase once it has lifted off from the Earth, Moon or Mars surfaces. This optimization is performed such that maximum payload is delivered into orbit. The tool simulates the rocket stages and also evaluates the launch opportunities for optimum launch. The orbit control can be performed by impulsive or continuous maneuvers both on circular and elliptical orbits. The type of maneuvers, their order and schedule is completely configurable by the users. The maneuvers are very accurate even under perturbations. In case the identified safety limits are trespassed, a collision avoidance maneuver (CAM) will be automatically activated, moving the spacecraft to a safety region. Th...|$|E

Northern <b>flying</b> squirrels, Glaucomys sabrinus are larger and have belly hair that is dark at the base and white at the tip. Southern <b>flying</b> squirrels, Glaucomys volans, are smaller and have belly hairs that are completely white. Humboldt's <b>flying</b> squirrel is more difficult to distinguish from the northern <b>flying</b> squirrel where their ranges overlap. In fact, they were considered conspecific.
