500|$|According to Durst, Limp Bizkit would [...] "comb {{the world}} for the illest guitar player known to man" [...] to replace Borland. After holding a {{nationwide}} audition for a new guitarist, [...] "Put Your Guitar Where Your Mouth Is", the band recorded with Snot guitarist Mike Smith. [...] "Mike brought <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> of fresh air," [...] Durst said. [...] "Creatively, it fit like a glove. It made life easier and more positive. It made us look forward to getting together as a band so much more. The positive effect he had on me just made the whole experience of Limp Bizkit feel like a brand-new entity." [...] Before Smith replaced Borland, Durst played a great deal of guitar. Jon Wiederhorn of MTV wrote, [...] "Limp Bizkit jammed with four finalists after their much-publicized guitarist audition tour, but now it looks like Fred Durst might be taking a cue from his Puddle of Mudd pal Wes Scantlin and handling both vocal and guitar duties himself." ...|$|E
