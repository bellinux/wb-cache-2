40|$|Currently, {{thermal barrier}} {{coatings}} (TBC) of gas-turbine blades and similar applications have {{centered around the}} use of zirconia as a protective coating for high thermal applications. The advantages of zirconia include low thermal conductivity and good thermal shock resistance. Thermally sprayed tungsten carbide <b>hardface</b> coatings are used {{for a wide range}} of applications spanning both the aerospace and other industrial markets. Major aircraft engine manufacturers and repair facilities use <b>hardface</b> coatings for original engine manufacture (OEM), as well as in the overhaul of critical engine components. The principle function of these coatings is to resist severe wear environments for such wear mechanisms as abrasion, adhesion, fretting, and erosion. The (JP- 5000) thermal spray gun is the most advanced in the High Velocity Oxygen Fuel (HVOF) systems. Recently, it has received considerable attention because of its relative low cost and its production of quality coatings that challenge the very successful but yet very expensive Vacuum Plasma Spraying (VPS) system. The quality of thermal spray coatings is enhanced as porosity, oxidation, residual stress, and surface roughness are reduced or minimized. Higher densification, interfacial bonding strength, hardness and wear resistance of coating are desirable features for quality improvement...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} Bureau of Mines {{program to}} reduce U.

This report describes a hydrometallurgical process that demonstrated on a laboratory scale that 79 pct of the chromium, 97 pct of the cobalt, 99 pct of the manganese, 99 pct of the nickel, and 90 pct of the tungsten could be recovered in chemical form from <b>hardface</b> alloy grinding waste. The process involved deoiling the grinding waste, followed by chloride-based dissolution of the deoiled material. A high-grade calcium tungstate (CaW 04) product was recovered from the resultant leach residue by caustic leaching and precipitation. Iron, cobalt, man-ganese, and nickel chlorides were sequentially recovered from the leach liquor by solvent extraction. Amine extractants were used to extract the iron, cobalt, and manganese; decanal oxime was used to extract the nickel. Market-grade cobalt chloride (CoCI 2), manganese chloride (MnC 12), and nickel chloride (NiCl 2) products could be produced directly from the resultant strip liquors.

40|$|Plasma {{assisted}} {{chemical vapor deposition}} (PACVD) {{represents a}} novel approach for utilizing the nonequilibrium effects of reactive plasmas for depositing {{a wide range of}} protective <b>hardface</b> coatings that have both wear and erosion application. The nonequilibrium plasma is the heart of this complex system and has the function of generating the reactive molecular fragments (radicals) and atomic species at concentration levels unattainable by other competing processes. It is now widely accepted that such advanced protective <b>hardface</b> coatings materials will {{play a vital role in}} the energy technologies of the coming decades, with major applications in diverse areas ranging from aerospace and commercial propulsion systems (jet engines) to automotive components and internal combustion engines, (ceramic heat engines), cutting and machining tools, electronic packaging, thermal management, and possibly room-temperature superconductors. Wear and associated erosion aspects are responsible for an enormous expenditure of energy and fiscal resources in almost all DOE applications. Many of the results from this investigation arc also applicable to other materials processing reactors such as electron beam, PVD, CVD, laser ablation, microwave, high energy cathodic arc, thermal plasma (rf or dc) and combustion spray.

5000|$|While Stellite {{remains the}} {{material}} of choice for certain internal parts in industrial process valves (valve seat <b>hardfacing),</b> its use has been discouraged in nuclear power plants. In piping that can communicate with the reactor, tiny amounts of Stellite would be released into the process fluid and eventually enter the reactor. There the cobalt would be activated by the neutron flux in the reactor and become cobalt-60, a radioisotope with a five year half life that releases very energetic gamma rays. While not a hazard to the general public, about a third to a half of nuclear worker exposures could {{be traced to the}} use of Stellite and to trace amounts of cobalt in stainless steels. Replacements for Stellite have been developed by the industry, such as the Electric Power Research Institute's [...] "NOREM", that provide acceptable performance without cobalt. Since the United States nuclear power industry has begun to replace the Stellite valve seat <b>hardfacing</b> in the late 1970s and to tighten specifications of cobalt in stainless steels, worker exposures due to cobalt-60 have dropped significantly.|$|E
50|$|Typical {{applications}} include saw teeth, <b>hardfacing,</b> and acid-resistant machine parts. Stellite {{was a major}} {{improvement in}} the production of poppet valves and valve seats for the valves, particularly exhaust valves, of internal combustion engines. By reducing their erosion from hot gases, the interval between maintenance and re-grinding of their seats was dramatically lengthened. The first third of the M2HB machine gun and M60 machine gun barrels (starting from the chamber) are lined with Stellite. The locking lugs and shoulders of Voere Titan II rifles were also made of Stellite. In the early 1980s, experiments were done in the United Kingdom to make artificial hip joints and other bone replacements out of precision-cast Stellite alloys. It is also widely used for making the cast structure of dental prostheses.|$|E

In this paper, {{a kind of}} surface <b>hardfacing</b> technology which deposited by using D 322 on 42 CrMo steel were studied instead of traditional manufacturing process. The effect of <b>hardfacing</b> parameters on microstructure, hardness and wear resistance are tested and analyzed.

40|$|<b>Hardfacing</b> alloys are weld {{deposited}} {{to provide}} a wear resistant surface for structural base materials. Commercial low cobalt <b>hardfacing</b> alloys are being evaluated to reduce plant activation levels. Since <b>hardfacing</b> alloys typically must be resistant to cracking to assure adequate in service performance, fracture toughness is a critical material property. Fracture toughness (K{sub IC}) measurements of Fe base, Ni-base, and Co-base <b>hardfacing</b> were performed in accordance with ASTM E 399 - 90 procedure {{in an effort to}} identify a tough cobalt-free alternative. Reduced scatter in K{sub IC} data was observed for the Fe base <b>hardfacing,</b> and the 95 % lower bound K{sub IC} values were generally higher than the Ni-base <b>Hardfacing</b> alloys. Preliminary crack growth data obtained during precracking indicate that the Ni-base <b>hardfacing</b> possess better fatigue crack growth resistance. However, none of the Fe-base or Ni-base <b>hardfacing</b> have K{sub IC} values that are comparable to the reference Co-base hard facing. The test specimens were machined from thick (0. 5 inches) weld deposits, and the microstructures of the test specimens are compared with the more prototypic, thinner deposits.

40|$|Abstract The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} aim to develop the welding procedure for multilayer <b>hardfacing</b> of 13 % Mn cast steel and to study behavior of <b>hardfacing</b> deposits after impact applied.

40|$|<b>Hardfacing</b> alloys are weld {{deposited}} on a base material {{to provide a}} wear resistant surface. Commercially available iron-base <b>hardfacing</b> alloys are being evaluated for replacement of cobalt-base alloys to reduce nuclear plant activation levels. Corrosion testing {{was used to evaluate}} the corrosion resistance of several iron-base <b>hardfacing</b> alloys in highly oxygenated environments. The corrosion test results indicate that iron-base <b>hardfacing</b> alloys in the as-deposited condition have acceptable corrosion resistance when the chromium to carbon ratio is greater than 4. Tristelle 5183, with a high niobium (stabilizer) content, did not follow this trend due to precipitation of niobium-rich carbides instead of chromium-rich carbides. This result indicates that iron-base <b>hardfacing</b> alloys containing high stabilizer contents may possess good corrosion resistance with Cr:C < 4. NOREM 02, NOREM 01, and NoCo-M 2 <b>hardfacing</b> alloys had acceptable corrosion resistance in the as-deposited and 885 C/ 4 hour heat treated condition, but rusting from sensitization was observed in the 621 C/ 6 hour heat treated condition. The feasibility of using an Electrochemical Potentiokinetic Reactivation (EPR) test method, such as used for stainless steel, to detect sensitization in iron-base <b>hardfacing</b> alloys was evaluated. A single loop-EPR method was found to provide a more consistent measurement of sensitization than a double loop-EPR method. The high carbon content that is needed for a wear resistant <b>hardfacing</b> alloy produces a high volume fraction of chromium-rich carbides that are attacked during EPR testing. This results in inherently lower sensitivity for detection of a sensitized iron-base <b>hardfacing</b> alloy than stainless steel using conventional EPR test methods...|$|E

Chromium and graphite alloy fillers {{were used to}} deposit <b>hardfacing</b> alloys on ASTM A 36 steel substrates. Depending on the four different graphite additions in these alloy fillers, this research produced hypereutectic microstructures of Fe-Cr phase and (Cr,Fe) (7) C(3) carbides on hard-facing alloys. The microstructural results indicated that primary (Cr,Fe) (7) C(3) carbides and eutectic colonies of [Cr-Fe+(Cr,Fe) (7) C(3) ] existed in <b>hardfacing</b> alloys. With increasing the C contents of the <b>hardfacing</b> alloys, the fraction of primary (Cr,Fe) (7) C(3) carbides increased and their size decreased. The hardness of <b>hardfacing</b> alloys increased with fraction of primary (Cr. Fe) (7) C(3) carbides. Regarding the abrasive characteristics, the wear resistance of <b>hardfacing</b> alloys were related to the fraction of primary (Cr,Fe) (7) C(3) carbides. The wear mechanism was also dominated by the fraction of primary (Cr,Fe) (7) C(3) carbides. Fewer primary carbides resulted in continuous scratches worn on the surface of <b>hardfacing</b> alloy. In addition, the formation of craters resulted from the fracture of carbides. However, the scratches became discontinuous with increasing fraction of the carbides. More primary carbides can effectively prevent the eutectic colonies from the damage of abrasive particles. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
