5|$|On 17 January 1919 Nansen married Sigrun Munthe, {{a long-time}} friend with whom <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> love affair in 1905, while Eva was still alive. The {{marriage}} was resented by the Nansen children, and proved unhappy; an acquaintance writing {{of them in}} the 1920s said Nansen appeared unbearably miserable and Sigrun steeped in hate.|$|E
5|$|On 5 April The Observer (the Guardians sister paper) {{published}} the first photograph of Tomlinson {{lying on the}} ground next to riot police. Over the next few days the IPCC told reporters that Tomlinson's family were not surprised that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> heart attack. When journalists asked whether he had been in contact with police officers before his death, they were told the speculation would upset the family.|$|E
5|$|Hunt's first successes {{were in the}} oilfields of Arkansas, but he {{lost most}} of his fortune by {{the outset of the}} Depression as {{overproduction}} depleted his fields and his speculation on land and oil drained his resources. He joined in Columbus Joiner's venture which opened the East Texas Oil Field. Hunt bought most of Joiner's interests in eastern Texas and his company, Placid Oil, owned hundreds of wells. He became established in Dallas and was labeled the richest man in the nation in 1948 by Fortune Magazine. A scandal emerged in 1975, after his death, when it was discovered that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> hidden bigamous relationship, with his second wife living in New York.|$|E

5|$|The biographer Montague Haltrecht {{suggests}} that Solti seized the breach of his Los Angeles contract as a convenient pretext {{to abandon the}} Philharmonic in favour of Covent Garden. However, in his memoirs Solti wrote that he wanted the Los Angeles position very much indeed. He originally considered holding both posts in tandem, but later acknowledged that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> lucky escape, as {{he could have done}} justice to neither post had he attempted to hold both simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|Tomlinson's {{death was}} {{confirmed}} {{in a statement}} that accused protesters of having hampered police efforts to save his life. His family were not told he had died until nine hours after his death. The police and IPCC told journalists that his family were not surprised to hear <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> heart attack. Journalists who asked whether police had had any contact with Tomlinson were asked not to speculate in case it upset the family. Direct contact with the family was refused. The police issued a statement on behalf of the family instead, which said the police were keeping them informed.|$|E
5|$|In 616, Rædwald {{defeated}} {{and killed}} Æthelfrith of Northumbria in the Battle of the River Idle and then installed Edwin {{as the new}} Deiran king. Whilst Edwin had been an exile at Rædwald's court, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> dream where {{he was told that}} if he converted to Christianity, he would become greater than any that had ruled before him. Steven Plunkett relates that, according to the version of events as told in the Whitby Life of St Gregory, it was Paulinus who visited Edwin and obtained his promise to convert to Christianity in return for regal power. After Edwin emerged as the ruler of Deira, with its centre at York, he became accepted as king of the northern Northumbrian province of Bernicia. Following his victory over the Northumbrians, Rædwald was not only king of the East Angles, but also the most powerful king amongst the rulers of the various English kingdoms, occupying the role which was later described by the term Bretwalda. He is thought by many to have been buried in the sumptuous ship burial at Sutton Hoo.|$|E

5|$|Stalin {{would allow}} him to retain the 11th Guards and {{suggested}} that Colonel-General N. E. Chibisov, an officer he had served under, assume his position. Bagramyan, however, commented that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> frictional relationship with Chibisov and instead nominated Lieutenant-General K. N. Galitsky. Stalin, belatedly realizing that Bagramyan was implying that the two would be unable to coordinate harmoniously due to a conflict of holding the same rank, agreed to Bagramyan's suggestion and promoted him to the rank Army General. He also agreed to have the Second Baltic Front return a tank corps and an infantry division that was taken from the 11th Guards, thus bolstering the forces under Bagramyan to a total of four armies: 11th Guards, 39th, 43rd and the 4th Shock.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1950s, Soedjatmoko and President Sukarno, {{with whom}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> warm working relationship, had a falling out over the president's {{increasingly}} authoritarian policies. In 1960 Soedjatmoko co-founded and headed the Democratic League, which attempted to promote democracy in the country; he also opposed Sukarno's Guided Democracy policy. When the effort failed, Soedjatmoko went to the US and took a position as guest lecturer at Cornell University. When he returned to Indonesia in 1962, he discovered that key members of the PSI had been arrested and the party banned; both Siasat and Pedoman were closed. To avoid trouble with the government, Soedjatmoko voluntarily left himself unemployed until 1965, when he became co-editor of An Introduction to Indonesian Historiography.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, Jones claimed <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{vision of}} Chicago coming under a nuclear attack. He claimed that Indianapolis {{would also be}} destroyed, convincing aides that the Temple needed {{to look for a}} new location.|$|E

25|$|In {{an ironic}} twist, he was {{promoted}} to temporary captain {{on the last day of}} the war, Armistice Day, 1918. In an era when fighter aces' careers were commonly measured in months, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> two-year string of victories. With seven years of flying experience, he was one of the world's most experienced aviators by the war's end.|$|E

25|$|Barker has {{had some}} minor health {{problems}}. Around 1982, he had a herniated disc and sciatica. Greater health problems began in 1991 after he complained of vision problems while exercising. After a visit to his doctor, {{he was sent to}} see a neurologist, who told Barker <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> mild stroke. He recovered and went back to work.|$|E
25|$|In 1934 he {{returned}} to bullfighting. Earlier <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> torrid affair with the French Hispanist Marcelle Auclair, whom he had met {{at the home of}} Jorge Guillén. His lovesickness was so clear to García Lorca that he wanted him to end the affair because he was convinced that La Argentinita would kill them both.|$|E
25|$|In 1990 he {{was invited}} to conduct the inaugural concert of the Irish Baroque Orchestra at the Third Early Music Festival in Dublin, but ill health intervened. Earlier <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> hip operation. John's partner Ruth died in 1995 and then, in December 2002, his sister Ann died as well.

25|$|By late 1978, Nilsen {{was living}} a solitary existence; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{minimum of three}} failed {{relationships}} in the previous 18 months, and he later confessed to having developed an increasing conviction that he was unfit to live with. Throughout 1978, he devoted an ever-increasing amount of his time, effort and assiduity to his work, and most evenings would be spent consuming spirits and/or lager as he listened to music.|$|E
25|$|Smith {{had been}} top scorer and leading wicket taker for the West Indians {{in each of}} the last three matches. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> run of being top scorer in 5 {{consecutive}} innings. At this stage of the tour he had scored over 700 runs at an average approaching 60 and taken over 50 wickets at an average of under 20 in just 8 matches, 4 first-class and 4 not.|$|E
25|$|About this time, Vengsarkar {{emerged as}} the strongest {{candidate}} to take over from Kapil. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> dream run with the bat, starting from the series in England in 1986. In 1987, the newly established Deloitte ratings (the forerunner of the current LG ratings) ranked him the best batsman in the world. The Indian selectors have conventionally leaned towards making the best player of the team the captain. So before the home series against West Indies, Kapil was sacked and Vengsarkar was made the Indian captain.|$|E
25|$|The grand {{marriage}} {{is a symbol of}} social status on the Comoros islands. The completion of an ada marriage also greatly increases a man’s standing in the Comoran hierarchy. A Comoran man can only wear certain elements of the national dress or stand in the first line at the mosque if <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> grand marriage. Also, one is not fully considered <b>a</b> man until <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> ada marriage.|$|R
