5|$|After rodents, bats are {{the largest}} order of mammals, making up about 20% of mammal species. There are 1,240 bat species which are {{traditionally}} recognized to belong to two suborders of bats: Megachiroptera (megabats), and the Microchiroptera (microbats/echolocating bats). Not all megabats are larger than microbats. Microbats use echolocation, but megabats do not, {{with the exception of}} the genus Rousettus. Microbats lack the claw at the second finger of the forelimb. The ears of microbats do not close to form a ring; the edges are separated from each other at the base of the ear. Megabats eat <b>fruit,</b> <b>nectar,</b> or pollen. Most microbats eat insects; others may feed on <b>fruit,</b> <b>nectar,</b> pollen, fish, frogs, small mammals, or the blood of animals. Megabats have well-developed visual cortices and good visual acuity, while microbats rely on echolocation for navigation and finding prey.|$|E
5|$|Some social wasps are omnivorous, {{feeding on}} fallen <b>fruit,</b> <b>nectar,</b> and carrion such as dead insects. Adult male wasps {{sometimes}} visit flowers to obtain nectar. Some wasps, such as Polistes fuscatus, commonly return to locations where they previously found prey to forage. In many social species, the larvae exude copious amounts of salivary secretions that are avidly {{consumed by the}} adults. These include both sugars and amino acids, and may provide essential protein-building nutrients that are otherwise unavailable to the adults (who cannot digest proteins).|$|E
5|$|Different bat {{species have}} {{different}} diets including insects, nectar, pollen, fruit and even vertebrates. Megabats are mostly <b>fruit,</b> <b>nectar</b> and pollen eaters. Due to their small size, high-metabolism and rapid burning of energy though flight, bats must consume {{large amounts of}} food for their size. Insectivorous bats may eat over 120 percent of their body weight while frugivorous bats may eat over twice their weight. Predatory bats typically hunt at night, reducing competition with birds, and minimizing contact with certain predators. They can travel large distances, up to , in search of food. Bats are not restricted to any one hunting strategy, but rather use a mix. The bite force of small bats is generated through mechanical advantage, allowing them to bite through the hardened armor of insects or the skin of fruit. Bats get most of their water needs from the food they eat. However, numerous species may drink from water sources like lakes and streams. They may fly over the water surface and dip their tongues.|$|E
25|$|The aye-aye {{commonly}} eats seeds, <b>fruits,</b> <b>nectar</b> and fungi, {{but also}} insect larvae classifying {{it as an}} omnivore.|$|R
50|$|The Asian fairy bluebird eats <b>fruits,</b> <b>nectar</b> {{and some}} insects. Its call is a liquid two note glue-it.|$|R
50|$|The gray four-eyed opossum has an {{omnivorous}} diet containing <b>fruits,</b> <b>nectar,</b> insects, {{small mammals}} (such as mice), birds, reptiles, amphibians, crustaceans, snails, and earthworms. Its diet {{varies depending on}} the season.|$|R
25|$|The few {{existing}} photos {{show that}} this species had dark-brown fur and darker wings. Nothing is known about their natural diet; however, {{it is likely to}} be similar to the diet of the closely related lesser short-tailed bat, which eats insects, especially beetles, flies, and moths, as well as flowers, <b>fruit,</b> <b>nectar,</b> and pollen. As a highly endangered member of an ancient evolutionary family, the species is accorded a high ranking on the EDGE list of mammals, sitting fourth.|$|E
25|$|Short-tailed bats are {{omnivorous}} and opportunistic, {{feeding on}} whatever {{food is available}} in their environments. They forage in areas of dense forest and deep leaf litter, and may travel considerable distances from roosting to foraging sites each night. Their wings have a low aspect ratio and low wing loading, suggesting high manoeuvrability and moderate flight speed, suitable both for long travel and foraging close to the ground. They {{have been reported to}} eat insects, especially beetles, flies, and moths, as well as flowers, <b>fruit,</b> <b>nectar,</b> and pollen.|$|E
25|$|The bats of New Guinea are a {{very diverse}} group, {{comprising}} six families, and 29 genera. The six families are: Pteropodidae, Emballonuridae, Hipposideridae, Rhinolophidae, Vespertilionidae and Molossidae. Bats migrated to New Guinea on many different occasions, with many species being shared with Australia, the Sunda Islands and even mainland Asia. The megabats, or Megachiropterans, of New Guinea are highly adapted, and many are endemic to New Guinea and surrounding islands. While most megabats are herbivorous, and eat <b>fruit,</b> <b>nectar</b> and flowers, some species within New Guinea have adapted to also eat insects whilst in flight; an ecological niche usually filled by microbats. Some species also forage on the ground, an adaptation not seen in areas with large predators.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether the quality of <b>fruit</b> <b>nectars</b> and wines available on the local market is in accordance with the quality prescribed by the Rulebook. The research involves analysis of blueberry, strawberry, peach, apple and orange <b>fruit</b> <b>nectars</b> from two companies (C 1 and C 2), and samples of red wines from three wineries (W 1 - 3). The following quality parameters were determined: soluble solids content (% Brix), actual acidity (pH) and titratable acidity in the nectars, and actual acidity (pH) and titratable acidity in the wines. All samples of <b>fruit</b> <b>nectars</b> met the prescribed % Brix requirements. Titratable acidity, expressed in g dm- 3 citric acid, in C 1 blueberry and strawberry nectars deviated from the values laid down in Rulebook 2 (Rulebook on the Quality of Fruit Juices, Concentrated Fruit Juices, Fruit Juice Powder, <b>Fruit</b> <b>Nectars</b> and Related Products- Official Gazette of RS Issue No. 27 / 2010). Deviations were detected in C 2 orange nectar. The total acid content in the analyzed wine samples, expressed in g dm- 3 of tartaric acid, corresponded to the values prescribed in Rulebook 1 (Rulebook on Quality and Other Requirements for Wine - Official Gazette Issues Nos. 54 / 99 and 39 / 2002, Official Gazette Issue No. 56 / 2003 - other Rulebook and Official Gazette Issue No. 87 / 2011 - other Rulebook and 26 / 2015 - other Rulebook) ...|$|R

25|$|The diet of parrots {{consists}} of seeds, <b>fruit,</b> <b>nectar,</b> pollen, buds, and sometimes arthropods and other animal prey. The {{most important of}} these for most true parrots and cockatoos are seeds; the evolution of the large and powerful bill can be explained primarily as an adaptation to opening and consuming seeds. All true parrots except the Pesquet's parrot employ the same method to obtain the seed from the husk; the seed is held between the mandibles and the lower mandible crushes the husk, whereupon the seed is rotated in the bill and the remaining husk is removed. A foot is sometimes used to help hold large seeds in place. Parrots are seed predators rather than seed dispersers, and in many cases where species are recorded as consuming fruit, they are only eating the fruit to get at the seed. As seeds often have poisons that protect them, parrots carefully remove seed coats and other chemically defended fruit parts prior to ingestion. Many species in the Americas, Africa, and Papua New Guinea consume clay, which releases minerals and absorbs toxic compounds from the gut.|$|E
500|$|Like {{most other}} {{starling}}s, the hoopoe starling was omnivorous, feeding on fruits, seeds, and insects. Its tongue—long, slender, sharp, and frayed—may {{have been able}} to move rapidly, helpful when feeding on <b>fruit,</b> <b>nectar,</b> pollen, and invertebrates. Its pelvic elements were robust and its feet and claws large, indicating that it foraged near the ground. Its jaws were strong; Morioka compared its skull to that of the hoopoe, and it may have foraged in a similar way, probing and opening holes in substrate by inserting and opening its beak. De Montbeillard was informed of the stomach contents of a dissected specimen, consisting of seeds and the berries of [...] "Pseudobuxus" [...] (possibly Eugenia buxifolia, a bush with sweet, orange berries). He noted that the bird weighed , and was fatter around June and July. Several accounts suggest that the hoopoe starling migrated on Réunion, spending six months in the lowlands and six months in the mountains. Food may have been easier to obtain in the lowlands during winter, with the birds breeding in the mountain forests during summer. The hoopoe starling probably nested in tree cavities. Its song was described as a [...] "bright and cheerful whistle" [...] and [...] "clear notes", indicating a similarity to the songs of other starlings.|$|E
2500|$|Patulin – Currently, this toxin {{has been}} advisably {{regulated}} on fruit products. [...] The EC and the FDA have limited it to under 50 µg/kg for fruit juice and <b>fruit</b> <b>nectar,</b> while limits of 25 µg/kg for solid-contained fruit products and 10 µg/kg for baby foods were {{specified by the}} EC.|$|E
50|$|This bat {{species is}} found {{in a variety of}} {{habitats}} ranging from tropical forests to urban environments.

It feeds on <b>fruits,</b> <b>nectar</b> and flowers.|$|R
5000|$|In the United Kingdom {{the name}} or {{names of the}} fruit {{followed}} by juice can only legally be used to describe a product which is 100% fruit juice, {{as required by the}} Fruit Juices and <b>Fruit</b> <b>Nectars</b> (England) Regulations and the Fruit Juices & <b>Fruit</b> <b>Nectars</b> (Scotland) Regulations 2003. However, a juice made by reconstituting concentrate can be called juice. A product described as fruit [...] "nectar" [...] must contain at least 25% to 50% juice, depending on the fruit. A juice or nectar including concentrate must state that it does. The term [...] "juice drink" [...] is not defined in the Regulations and can be used to describe any drink which includes juice, however little. Comparable rules apply in all EU member states in their respective languages.|$|R
50|$|Red fruit bats are frugivores. They {{primarily}} feed on fruit like Cecropia schrebriana, Manilkara bidentata, and Prestoea montana. It {{has been}} shown that they can also survive on mangos, <b>fruit</b> <b>nectars,</b> and bananas, but they need to have the flesh of the fruit exposed for the animal to eat it.|$|R
60|$|But, {{under the}} housewifery of Proserpina, {{since we are}} to call the juice of <b>fruit,</b> <b>Nectar,</b> its {{substance}} will be as naturally and easily called Ambrosia; and I {{have no doubt that}} this, with the other names defined in this chapter, will not only be found practically more convenient than the phrases in common use, but will more securely fix in the student's mind a true conception of {231} the essential differences in substance, which, ultimately, depend wholly on their pleasantness to human perception, and offices for human good; and not at all on any otherwise explicable structure or faculty. It is of no use to determine, by microscope or retort, that cinnamon is made of cells with so many walls, or grape-juice of molecules with so many sides;--we are just as far as ever from understanding why these particular interstices should be aromatic, and these special parallelopipeds exhilarating, as we were in the savagely unscientific days when we could only see with our eyes, and smell with our noses. But to call each of these separate substances by a name rightly belonging to it through all the past variations of the language of educated man, will probably enable us often to discern powers in the thing itself, of affecting the human body and mind, which are indeed qualities infinitely more its own, than any which can possibly be extracted by the point of a knife, or brayed out with a mortar and pestle.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Juices and <b>fruit</b> <b>nectars</b> are an {{important}} segment of the beverage market in Brazil. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze and characterize the profile of consumers of ready-to-drink juices and <b>fruit</b> <b>nectars.</b> A semi-structured questionnaire was applied to 389 patrons, intentionally and conveniently, when they approached the shelves. The chi-square test was applied to associate sociodemographic variables and consumption profile of the beverages with the type of establishment. Logistic regression models were developed to evaluate the variables associated with nectar acquisition. The level of education and knowledge about the beverages were significantly related. Practicality was the main reason that led respondents to consume these drinks, followed by quality and price, with the latter being associated with the level of education. Nectar was the most purchased option, and this choice was associated with increasing age and education, price and practicality. The consumption of juices and nectars with no added sugar was lower compared with traditional beverages. The information in the labels of these beverages was not sufficiently clear, for most of the participants. The most mentioned brand by the interviewed was the one with better sensory preference, regardless of flavour and the blinded or informed analysis...|$|R
