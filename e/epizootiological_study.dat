40|$|Seasonal and {{geographic}} studies of transmissible sarcoma in Maryland softshell clams, Mya arenaria, {{were carried out}} from 1984 to 1988. Three major epizootics occurred in our sampling location during this time, resulting in prevalences as high as 90 %, with comparable mortalities in other high prevalence areas. The disease invaded populations of large adult clams first, later spreading to the small juvenile clam populations. An apparent 2 -year cycle was noted with varying seasonal effects. Affected sites tended {{to be in the}} main stem of Chesapeake Bay north of Tangier Sound, primarily in the areas where the major harvesting occurs. Several sites, mostly in upstream locations, were consistently free of disease. The <b>epizootiological</b> <b>study</b> supports the interpretation that the disease is infectious exclusively to this species. Regression analysis between sarcoma prevalence and contaminant levels in clam tissues showed a significant correlation (p = 0. 0001) between chlordane levels and this disease.

40|$|Abstract. A 2 -year <b>epizootiological</b> <b>study</b> {{was carried}} out on Schistosoma bovis in cattle in an {{enzootic}} area of the Sudan. The prevalence of infection, as judged by the Pitchford fecal egg counting technique, was very high, approaching 90 % in 1. 5 -year-old animals. There was, however, a lower prevalence in olden cattle, and this trend was also seen with the fecal egg counts. This suggests that the cattle gradually acquire resistance to reinfection, particu larly since {{there seems to be}} little age-related variation in the amount of water contact. Monthly incidence rates, estimated from fecal examinations of initially uninfected â€œtracerâ€• calves showed a marked seasonal pattern, being much higher in the hot summer months, and snail infection rates showed a similar seasonal pattern. In addition, both the monthly incidence measurements and the snail infection rates showed that transmission was much heavier in 1976 than in 1977. Epizootics such as those recorded previously in this area presumably arise from exceptionally intense transmission years. Schistosoma bovis, a widely distributed para site of domestic animals in many African and Mediterranean countries, ' is common in cattle...|$|E

To achieve diagnosis of this rickettsia in cattle and campeiro deer of Brazilian Pantanal, a comparison was made between a real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with intercalating Sybr Green fluorochrome and primers based on msp 5 gene of A. marginale; a conventional PCR (C-PCR); and parasitological examination using thin blood smear stained with Giemsa-MayGrunwald. Both PCRs showed good performance in the diagnosis of A. marginale in cattle, and were superior to the parasitological exam. The RT-PCR detected seven positive campeiro deer (16. 3 %). This rate was significantly higher compared to C-PCR, which identified one animal as positive (2. 3 %), and also compared to parasitological diagnosis, which {{did not find any}} positive animals. The dissociation temperature average of positive reactions in cattle (81. 72 ºC ± 0. 20) was identical to dissociation temperature found in the cervids (81. 72 ºC ± 0. 12), suggesting that both animal species were infected with A. marginale. We concluded that RT-PCR can be used for A. marginale diagnosis and in epizootiological studies of cattle and cervids; in spite of the small number of campeiro deer samples, the results indicated that this wildlife species has importance in the Anaplasma epizootiology in the Brazilian Pantanal...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Over {{the last}} two winters, there have been large-scale, unexplained losses of managed honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies in the United States. In {{the absence of a}} known cause, this {{syndrome}} was named Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) because the main trait was a rapid loss of adult worker bees. We initiated a descriptive <b>epizootiological</b> <b>study</b> in order to better characterize CCD and compare risk factor exposure between populations afflicted by and not afflicted by CCD. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Of 61 quantified variables (including adult bee physiology, pathogen loads, and pesticide levels), no single measure emerged as a most-likely cause of CCD. Bees in CCD colonies had higher pathogen loads and were co-infected with a greater number of pathogens than control populations, suggesting either an increased exposure to pathogens or a reduced resistance of bees toward pathogens. Levels of the synthetic acaricide coumaphos (used by beekeepers to control the parasitic mite Varroa destructor) were higher in control colonies than CCD-affected colonies. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first comprehensive survey of CCD-affected bee populations that suggests CCD involves an interaction between pathogens and other stress factors. We present evidence that this condition is contagious or the result of exposure to a common risk factor. Potentially important areas for future hypothesis-driven research, including the possible legacy effect of mite parasitism and the role of honey bee resistance to pesticides, are highlighted.

Six discrete typing units (DTUs) of T. cruzi, named TcI to TcVI, are currently recognized.

40|$|Background: Coccidiosis of {{domestic}} fowl, caused by {{species of the}} Genus Eimeria, is responsi­ble for important economic losses in poultry production. Because different species and/or strains can vary in pathogenicity and other biological parameters, their precise characteriza­tion is important for <b>epizootiological</b> <b>studies.</b> Methods: Fifty samples from litter, whole intestinal tract and feces were collected from poul­try houses located in different provinces of Iran. One hundred twenty male day-old broi­ler chicks were challenged with three selected isolates. Data on weight gain, Food Conversion Ratio (FCR), food intake, lesion scoring and shedding of oocysts per gram of feces were rec­orded and analyzed by the Duncan's test. Results: In all treatments, the challenged groups had statistically significant lower weight gain than that of unchallenged control group. Isolate three caused the lowest weight gain and food intake and the worst lesion score as well as FCR. Despite originating from close geographi­cal regions for isolates 1 and 2, the difference in biopathologic factors may be either due to different proportion of identified species or the different pathogenicity of the species present in the isolates. Conclusion: The results highlight the importance of considering various species of Eimeria in designing the preventive, control and treatment strategies to prevent coccidiosis in different regions of Iran. Further characterization of each isolate {{would be the next}} step to provide a basis for coccidiosis research with well-characterized local isolates...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – The genus Perkinsus {{includes}} protistan parasites infecting {{marine molluscs}} throughout the world, {{some of which}} are associated with mass mortalities. Life cycle involves vegetative proliferation within the host, by which a cell named trophozoite undergoes successive bipartitioning. Other stages have been observed in vitro or in vivo, depending on the species: hypnospore, zoosporangium and zoospore. Molecular taxonomy supports a close affinity between dinoflagellates and Perkinsus spp. Six species of Perkinsus are currently considered valid: P. marinus, P. olseni, P. qugwadi, P. chesapeaki, P. andrewsi and P. mediterraneus. Histology and, above all, incubation of host tissues in Ray’s fluid thioglycollate medium (RFTM) are classic diagnostic methods. In addition, more sensitive and quicker molecular diagnostic techniques based on either immunoassays or PCR have been developed for Perkinsus spp. <b>Epizootiological</b> <b>studies</b> have shown a marked influence of water temperature and salinity on P. marinus infection in oysters Crassostrea virginica, thus determining parasite geographical range and temporal disease dynamics (seasonality). In vitro cultures have been established for four Perkinsus spp. Immune response to infection varies depending on host and involves phagocytosis or encapsulation of the parasite cells by host haemocytes. A polypeptide is secreted by clam Tapes philippinarum haemocytes that could kill the parasite. In vitro cultured P. marinus cells secrete proteases that are likely involved in degradation of host tissues. P. marinus can suppress the toxic oxygen radicals produced by host haemocytes. In addition to host death, sublethal effects caused by Perkinsus spp. (reduction of fecundity, growth, an...|$|R

Sensitive and effective methods for detection and identification of Ichthyobodo spp. are needed to aid diagnosis of ichthyobodosis and <b>epizootiological</b> <b>studies</b> on Ichthyobodo spp. We have designed a specific quantitative real-time PCR assay targeting SSU rDNA for the detection of Ichthyobodo spp. infections. Also, several novel primer sets are presented for use in identification of Ichthyobodo spp. through PCR and sequencing. These PCR methods have been optimized and tested on samples from wild caught and farmed fish from different geographical areas in Norway.

40|$|Thottapalayam virus (TPMV), {{a member}} of the genus Hantavirus in the family Bunyaviridae, was {{isolated}} from an insectivore, Suncus murinus (musk shrew), captured in southern India in 1964. While the isolation of TPMV predates the discovery of the prototype Hantaan virus, little is known about its genetics and biology. To date, preliminary evidence suggests that TPMV differs significantly, both antigenically and genetically, from all known rodent-borne hantaviruses. However, since detailed <b>epizootiological</b> <b>studies</b> have not been conducted, it is unclear if TPMV is naturally harbored by an insectivore host or if TPMV represents a “spillover” from its natural rodent reservoir host. Moreover, to what extent TPMV causes infection and/or disease in humans is not known. To address these issues, we first studied the antigenic profile of TPMV using monoclonal antibodies against Hantaan and Seoul viruses and polyclonal immune sera against Puumala virus and TPMV. Armed with this newfound information, we developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for the diagnosis of TPMV infections in shrews and humans, using a recombinant TPMV N antigen manipulated to have an E 5 /G 6 epitope to be captured by monoclonal antibody clone E 5 /G 6. Using this assay, we found anti-TPMV antibodies in sera from a patient with high fever of unknown etiology in Thailand and from two shrews captured in Indonesia. Seropositivity was verified by the indirect immunofluorescence antibody test, Western blotting analysis, and focus reduction neutralization test. Collectively, our data indicate that TPMV is harbored by Suncus murinus as its host in nature and is capable of infecting humans...|$|R
40|$|The insect-{{pathogen}}ic fungal pathogen Entomophaga maimaiga is {{endemic to}} northeastern Asia and was first found in North America in 1989. Due to repeated epizootics and spread within {{populations of the}} major forest defoliator in northeastern North America, the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), this pathogen has gained much notoriety. Although this pathogen was purposely introduced to North America for biological control of L. dispar in 1910 to 1911, it is questionable whether it became established {{at the time of}} release and then remained at innocuous levels until relatively recently. Alternatively, the fungal strain present in North America today could be a more recent accidental introduction. DNA analysis demonstrates that this pathogen differs significantly from North American members of the same species complex (the Lepidoptera-specific Entomophaga aulicae species complex), and, to date, isolates of this introduced pathogen display little heterogeneity in North America. Nonsusceptible lepidopteran larvae have been identified, and either E. maimaiga is unable to penetrate the cuticle or the fungus cannot survive within the hemocoel. In the latter case, although E. maimaiga grows as protoplasts lacking cell walls in the host hemolymph, glycoproteins on plasma membranes of the protoplasts could lead to host recognition. <b>Epizootiological</b> <b>studies</b> demonstrate a clear association between fungal activity and environmental moisture but little association with host density under hypothesized conditions of high fungal density. Prediction of the occurrence of epizootics is not yet possible. E. maimaiga is easily established in new areas by releasing azygospores, but the ability to use this pathogen further for biological control will depend, in large part, on the development of mass production systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{life cycle}} of the brachylaimid {{trematode}} species Renylaima capensis, infecting the urinary system of the shrew Myosorex varius (Mammalia: Soricidae: Crocidosoricinae) in the Hottentots Holland Nature Reserve, South Africa, has been elucidated by a study of its larval stages, epizootiological data in local snails and mammals during a 34 -year period, and its verification with mtDNA sequencing. Methods Parasites obtained from dissected animals were mounted in microscope slides for the parasitological study and measured according to standardized methods. The mitochondrial DNA cox 1 gene was sequenced by the dideoxy chain-termination method. Results The slugs Ariostralis nebulosa and Ariopelta capensis (Gastropoda: Arionidae) act as specific first and second intermediate hosts, respectively. Branched sporocysts massively develop in A. nebulosa. Intrasporocystic mature cercariae show differentiated gonads, male terminal duct, ventral genital pore, and usually no tail, opposite to Brachylaimidae in which mature cercariae show a germinal primordium and small tail. Unencysted metacercariae, usually brevicaudate, infect the kidney of A. capensis and differ from mature cercariae by only a slightly greater size. The final microhabitats are the kidneys and ureters of the shrews, kidney pelvis and calyces in light infections and also kidney medulla and cortex in heavy infections. Sporocysts, cercariae, metacercariae and adults proved to belong to R. capensis by analysis of a 437 -bp-long cox 1 fragment, which was identical except for three mutations in metacercariae, of which only one silent. <b>Epizootiological</b> <b>studies</b> showed usual sporocyst infection in A. nebulosa and very rare metacercarial infection in A. capensis, which does not agree with high prevalences and intensities in the shrews. Conclusions The presence of monotesticular adult forms and larval prevalences and intensities observed suggest that R. capensis may use two transmission strategies, a two-host life cycle by predation of A. nebulosa harbouring intrasporocystic cercariae may be the normal pattern, whereas a second mollusc host is just starting to be introduced. In shrews, a tissue-traversing, intraorganic migration followed by an interorganic migration to reach and penetrate the outer surface of either of both kidneys should occur. For first slug infection, the fluke {{takes advantage of the}} phenomenon that M. varius always urinate during defaecation. Consequently, in Brachylaimidae, the second intermediate mollusc host should evolutionarily be seen as a last addition to the cycle and their present adult stage microhabitat restricted to digestive tract and related organs as a loss of the tissue-traversing capacity of the metacercaria. </p...|$|R
