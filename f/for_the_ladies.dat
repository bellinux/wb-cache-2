The Mounties had a reputation for running these posts honestly, although accusations were made that they took bribes.

5|$|Mary was {{depicted}} by Jacobites as an unfaithful daughter who destroyed her father {{for her own}} and her husband's gain. In {{the early years of}} their reign, she was often seen as completely under the spell of her husband, but after she had temporarily governed alone during his absences abroad, she was portrayed as capable and confident. Nahum Tate's A Present <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ladies</b> (1692) compared her to Queen Elizabeth I. Her modesty and diffidence were praised in works such as A Dialogue Concerning Women (1691) by William Walsh, which compared her to Cincinnatus, the Roman general who took on a great task when called to do so, but then willingly abandoned power.|$|E

25|$|In {{the title}} sequence, Arthur is shown meeting Terry {{at the prison}} gates {{following}} his release. He drives a white Ford Capri, although it is never made clear whether Terry had bought the vehicle from Arthur, hence their meeting, or if Arthur had given to Terry this car {{as part of their}} ensuing working deal, {{in the same manner as}} the flat that Arthur houses Terry in. (Terry drives a copper coloured Capri in some mid-run episodes, and a silver Capri in several others, and the exact model is seen to vary between different episodes). Terry enjoys a drink but usually responsibly, does not smoke and has an eye <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>ladies.</b> Despite his incarceration, he is honest, trustworthy and loyal, particularly to Arthur, although the scrapes that Arthur lands him in make him wonder why. He is intelligent and streetwise enough to disperse situations that his role as minder often lands himself - and Arthur or those around him - in, although at the same time is seen not to be strong willed enough to break free of Arthur's often devious ways of keeping their working relationship in place.|$|E

500|$|His flair, having {{previously}} {{only been}} put into socialising, suited journalism and did not go unnoticed. With his youth nearly over, and a family to support, in mid-1887 Wilde became the editor of The Lady's World magazine, his name prominently appearing on the cover. He promptly renamed it The Woman's World and raised its tone, adding serious articles on parenting, culture, and politics, keeping discussions of fashion and arts. Two pieces of fiction were usually included, one to be read to children, the other <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>ladies</b> themselves. Wilde worked hard to solicit good contributions from his wide artistic acquaintance, including those of Lady Wilde and his wife Constance, while his own [...] "Literary and Other Notes" [...] were themselves popular and amusing.|$|E

The entertainment finished with a football match between Small Heath F.C. and a theatre XI, refereed by music hall artiste Vesta Tilley. Despite the cold wind and intermittent snow, the event attracted 8,000spectators and raised £100 for each of three local hospitals.|$|E

500|$|Sullivan's {{best known}} contrapuntal device was [...] "the {{simultaneous}} presentation {{of two or}} more distinct melodies previously heard independently". He was not the first composer to combine themes in this way, but it became a characteristic feature of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. [...] Sometimes the melodies were for solo voices, as in [...] "Once more the face I loved so well" [...] (The Zoo), and [...] "I am so proud" [...] (The Mikado), which combines three melodic lines; other examples are in choruses, where typically a graceful tune <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>ladies</b> is combined with a robust one for the men. Examples include [...] "When the Foeman bares his steel" [...] (The Pirates of Penzance), [...] "In a doleful train" [...] (Patience) and [...] "Welcome, gentry" [...] (Ruddigore). At other times, notably in [...] "How beautifully blue the sky" [...] (The Pirates of Penzance), one theme is given to the chorus and the other to solo voices.|$|E
500|$|In late 2009, McAdams {{starred in}} the mystery/action-adventure film Sherlock Holmes with Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law. She played Irene Adler, an {{antagonist}} and love interest of Downey's title character Sherlock Holmes, and welcomed {{the opportunity to play}} a character who is [...] "her own boss and a real free spirit". Todd McCarthy of Variety felt her character was [...] "not very well integrated into the rest of the story, a shortcoming the normally resourceful McAdams is unable to do much about". A. O. Scott of The New York Times stated, [...] "Ms.McAdams is a perfectly charming actress and performs gamely as the third wheel of this action-bromance tricycle. But Irene feels in this movie more like a somewhat cynical commercial contrivance. She offers a little something <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>ladies</b> and also something for the lads, who, much as they may dig fights and explosions and guns and chases, also like girls." [...] The film was a major commercial success, earning over $524 million at the worldwide box office.|$|E
500|$|The {{area which}} is now Tunbridge Wells {{was part of the}} parish of Speldhurst for {{hundreds}} of years, but the origin of the town as it is today, however, came in the seventeenth century. In 1606 Dudley, Lord North, a courtier to James I who was staying at a hunting lodge in Eridge {{in the hope that the}} country air might improve his ailing constitution, discovered a chalybeate spring. He drank from the spring and, when his health improved, he became convinced that it had healing properties. He persuaded his rich friends in London to try it, and by the time Queen Henrietta Maria, wife of King Charles I, visited in 1630 it had established itself as a spa retreat. By 1636 it had become so popular that two houses were built next to the spring to cater for the visitors, one <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>ladies</b> and one for the gentlemen, and in 1664 Lord Muskerry, Lord of the Manor, enclosed it with a triangular stone wall, and built a hall [...] "to shelter the dippers in wet weather." ...|$|E
