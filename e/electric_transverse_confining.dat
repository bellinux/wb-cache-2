40|$|This report {{describes}} an experimental and analytical {{investigation of the}} strength and ductility of reinforced concrete columns. Four columns of square cross-section were tested under axial compression loading and cyclic lateral loading applied at mid-height which simulated seismic loading. The main variable investigated was the quantity of <b>transverse</b> <b>confining</b> steel used, which ranged between 17 to 46 percent of the NZS 3101 : 1982 recommended quantity for ductile detailing.

40|$|We {{study the}} recent Floquet-realisation of the Harper-Hofstadter model in a gas of cold bosonic atoms. We study {{in detail the}} {{scattering}} processes in this system in the weakly interacting regime due to the interplay of particle interactions and the explicit time dependence of the Floquet states that lead to band transitions and heating. We focus on the experimentally used parameters and explicitly model the <b>transverse</b> <b>confining</b> direction. Based on transition rates computed within the Floquet-Fermi golden rule we obtain band population dynamics which are {{in agreement with the}} dynamics observed in experiment. Finally, we discuss whether and how photon-assisted collisions that may be the source heating and band population dynamics might be suppressed in the experimental setup by appropriate design of the <b>transverse</b> <b>confining</b> potential. The suppression of such processes will become increasingly important as the experiments progress into simulating strongly interacting systems in the presence of artificial gauge fields.

40|$|When a beam {{of light}} is {{laterally}} confined, its field distribution can exhibit points where the local magnetic and electric field vectors spin in a plane containing the propagation direction of the electromagnetic wave. The phenomenon indicates the presence of a non-zero transverse spin density. Here, we experimentally investigate this transverse spin density of both magnetic and electric fields, occurring in highly-confined structured fields of light. Our scheme relies on the utilization of a high-refractive-index nano-particle as local field probe, exhibiting magnetic and electric dipole resonances in the visible spectral range. Because of the directional emission of dipole moments which spin around an axis parallel to a nearby dielectric interface, such a probe particle is capable of locally sensing the magnetic and <b>electric</b> <b>transverse</b> spin density of a tightly focused beam impinging under normal incidence with respect to said interface. We exploit the achieved experimental results to emphasize the difference between magnetic and <b>electric</b> <b>transverse</b> spin densities. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
