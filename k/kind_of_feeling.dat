He reportedly voted for Winston Churchill's Conservative party in 1945, {{but there is little}} other mention of party politics in the biographies.

500|$|In an interview, Coldplay vocalist Chris Martin {{revealed}} that the song was written in mid-2004 and was inspired by Martin's daughter, Apple, and English alternative rock singer Kate Bush: [...] "That's a song where we were listening {{to a lot of}} Kate Bush last summer, and we wanted a song which had a lot of tom-toms in it. I just had my daughter up also, and was <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> in a sense of awe and wonderment, so the song is kind of a Kate Bush song about miracles." [...] The drumbeat of the song was inspired by Bush's 1985 song [...] "Running Up that Hill". In a separate interview, bassist Guy Berryman said: [...] "We were really trying to recreate the drums on that song for this song, and the chords.

500|$|In 1951, Hawks produced, {{and some}} believe {{essentially}} directed, a science-fiction film, The Thing from Another World. Director John Carpenter stated: [...] "And let's get the record straight. The movie {{was directed by}} Howard Hawks. Verifiably directed by Howard Hawks. He let his editor, Christian Nyby, take credit. But the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> between the male characters—the camaraderie, the group of men that has to fight off the evil—it's all pure Hawksian." [...] He followed this with the 1952 western film The Big Sky, starring Kirk Douglas. Later in 1952, Hawks work with Cary Grant for the fifth and final time in the screwball comedy Monkey Business, which also starred Marilyn Monroe and Ginger Rogers. Grant plays a scientist (reminiscent of his character in Bringing up Baby) who creates a formula that increases his vitality. Film critic John Belton called the film Hawks's [...] "most organic comedy." [...] Hawks's third film of 1952 was {{a contribution to the}} omnibus film O. Henry's Full House, which includes short stories by the writer O. Henry made by various directors. Hawks's short film The Ransom of Red Chief starred Fred Allen, Oscar Levant and Jeanne Crain.|$|E

You guys get to do that. We picked two different ones and we weren't sure." [...] The alternative endings included three varying scenes: in the first, the video ends with a close-up of Lopez's face in the silver lace catsuit; the second ends with a shot of dancers defying gravity on the walls and ceiling, while the final ending ends with a shot of Lopez on the dance floor in her harem pants. The first ending was the one used in the final video.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} The Elephant Man (1980), Lynch met producer Richard Roth over coffee. Roth {{had read}} and enjoyed Lynch's Ronnie Rocket script, {{but did not}} think it was something he wanted to produce. He asked Lynch if the filmmaker had any other scripts, but the director only had ideas. [...] "I told him I had always wanted to sneak into a girl's room to watch her into the night and that, maybe, at one point or another, I would see something that would be the clue to a murder mystery. Roth loved the idea and asked me to write a treatment. I went home and thought of the ear in the field." [...] Production was announced in August 1984. Lynch wrote two more drafts before he was satisfied with the script of the film. Conditions at this point were ideal for Lynch's film: he had made a deal with Dino De Laurentiis that gave him complete artistic freedom and final cut privileges, with the stipulation that the filmmaker take a cut in his salary and work with a budget of only $6 million. This deal meant that Blue Velvet was the smallest film on the De Laurentiis' slate. Consequently, Lynch would be left mostly unsupervised during production. [...] "After Dune I was down so far that anything was up! So it was just a euphoria. And when you work with that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeling,</b> you can take chances. You can experiment." [...] Because the material was completely different from anything that would be considered mainstream at the time, Laurentiis had to start his own company to distribute it.|$|E

500|$|Sgt. Pepper was {{the first}} major pop/rock LP to include its {{complete}} lyrics, which appeared on the back cover. Those lyrics were the subject of critical analysis; for instance, in late 1967 the album {{was the subject of a}} scholarly inquiry by American literary critic and professor of English Richard Poirier, who observed that his students were [...] "listening to the group's music with a degree of engagement that he, as a teacher of literature, could only envy". Poirier identified what he termed its [...] "mixed allusiveness": [...] "It's unwise ever to assume that they're doing only one thing or expressing themselves in only one style... one <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> about a subject isn't enough... any single induced feeling must often exist within the context of seemingly contradictory alternatives." [...] McCartney said at the time: [...] "We write songs. We know what we mean by them. But in a week someone else says something about it, and you can't deny it.... You put your own meaning at your own level to our songs." [...] The album's elaborate cover also attracted considerable interest and study. A collage designed by pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, it depicted the group as the fictional band referred to in the album's title track standing in front of a crowd of famous people. The heavy moustaches worn by the group reflected the growing influence of hippie style, while cultural historian Jonathan Harris describes their [...] "brightly coloured parodies of military uniforms" [...] as a knowingly [...] "anti-authoritarian and anti-establishment" [...] display.

[...] In terms of the film's {{animation}} style and settings, the film combines Eastern world culture (predominantly Japanese) with Western world culture (predominantly California). In May 2013, Disney released concept art and rendered footage of San Fransokyo from the film. San Fransokyo, the futuristic mashup of San Francisco and Tokyo, was described by Hall as [...] "an alternate version of San Francisco. Most of the technology is advanced, but much of it feels retro … Where Hiro lives, it feels like the Haight. I love the Painted ladies. We gave them a Japanese makeover; we put a cafe on the bottom of one. They live above a coffee shop." [...] According to production designer Paul Felix, [...] "The topography is exaggerated because what we do is caricature, I think the hills are 1½ times exaggerated. I don't think you could really walk up them … When you get to the downtown area, that's when you get the most Tokyo-fied, that pure, layered, dense <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> of the commercial district there. When you get out of there, it becomes more San Francisco with the Japanese aesthetic. … (It's a bit like) Blade Runner, but contained to a few square blocks.

2500|$|He was {{the first}} to tell the {{audience}} that King had died; some of the attendees screamed and wailed in grief. Several of Kennedy's aides were even worried that the delivery of this information would result in a riot. When the audience quieted, Kennedy acknowledged that many would be filled with anger. He said: [...] "For {{those of you who are}} black and are tempted to be filled with hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act, against all white people, I would only say that I can also feel in my own heart the same <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeling.</b> I had a member of my family killed, but he was killed by a white man." [...] These remarks surprised his aides, who had never heard him speak publicly of his brother's death. Kennedy said that the country had to make an effort to [...] "go beyond these rather difficult times", and quoted a poem by the Greek playwright Aeschylus, [...] "Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God."

2500|$|As {{a result}} of this sudden bit of {{inspiration}} when working on her next album, Amos requested that Lamb shoot additional footage for this project instead, forming the idea for a complementary [...] "road chronicle" [...] that would accompany Abnormally Attracted to Sin. Amos also stated that viewing the 2007 footage directly inspired her to write some of the songs. That the original footage dates back to the previous album period can observed in the video clips as Amos' fashion, styling and appearance {{is the same as the}} artwork and promotion during the release and tour supporting American Doll Posse. [...] The footage was shot in HD and Super 8. Seemingly inspired more by fashion, scenery and art, rather than by silent films or typical music videos, The Road Chronicles is composed of 16 vignettes in which Amos can be seen in dream-sequences infused with myriad metaphors, symbols, images, locations and haute couture fashion-pieces, meant to evoke and open up the themes and experiences tackled on each of the corresponding album songs. Commenting on not pursuing a more traditional form of music videos, Amos stated: [...] "I began to really think about the idea of a story being told through the visuals and yet the song itself giving us all the information – that’s our dialogue. I didn’t want any lip-syncing." [...] About the look of the visualettes, Amos has said: [...] "We wanted to do pretty much 8mm and more of a late ‘60’s, indie <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> and that began the visualette world." ...|$|E

However, several sentimentalists have argued that moral judgments involve not only having a specific <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>feelings</b> or emotional responses, but judging that one would be justified in having that feeling or emotional response. In the literature, some authors have taken up the former position because the empirical data on moral judgment seems to suggest that justification is not a necessary prerequisite for making a moral judgment. Even if this is true, however, I argue that justifying moral judgments is still an important philosophic endeavour, and that developing an empirically constrained account of how a person might go about justifying his feelings/emotional responses as reasons for rendering (normative) moral judgments by using a coherentist method of justification is both plausible and desirable...|$|R

5000|$|Sleep paralysis, for example, {{can produce}} {{the feeling that}} one is paralyzed or has {{difficulty}} moving. It can also produce the effect of floating or the sense of an out-of-body experience. Sleep paralysis occurs in a transition time and the person is in a dream-like state, hallucinations can occur just before falling asleep (hynogogic hallucination) or just after (hypnopompic hallucination). These hallucinations feel real to the person experiencing sleep paralysis and can often be accompanied by sensory features: musty smells, shuffling sounds, visions of ghosts, aliens, and monsters. Neuroscientist Michael Persinger of Laurentian University in Greater Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, believes that these sensations can spontaneously occur in some people, given the right set of circumstances, leading to the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> [...] "tremendous meaningfulness and fear" [...] sometimes expressed by alleged alien abductees.|$|R
