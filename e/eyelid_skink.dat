5000|$|The terror skink (Phoboscincus bocourti), {{also called}} Bocourt’s terrific skink or Bocourt's <b>eyelid</b> <b>skink,</b> is {{a species of}} skink endemic to the Île des Pins (Isle of Pines), a small islet {{off the coast of}} New Caledonia. First {{described}} in 1876, it was presumed to be extinct, but was rediscovered in 1993, and since then several individuals have been seen. Because of its small area of occupation and small population size, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being [...] "endangered".|$|E
