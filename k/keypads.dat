500|$|At {{any given}} time, one {{contestant}} {{sat in the}} [...] "Money Chair" [...] and accumulated money while defending his/her position against a series of challengers in head-to-head quiz bouts. Each bout lasted a set number of seconds; after a question was read, the contestants had five seconds to secretly lock in their answers on separate <b>keypads.</b> The contestant in the chair earned money {{at a rate of}} $10 per second, even when bouts were not being played and during the prime time commercial breaks. When this contestant lost a bout, he/she stopped earning money and the challenger took control of the chair. Only the four contestants with the highest total winnings kept their money once the countdown clock ran out of time.|$|E
500|$|The {{player can}} upgrade their skills by using [...] "cyber-modules" [...] given as rewards for {{completing}} objectives such as searching {{the ship and}} then spend them at devices called [...] "cyber-upgrade units" [...] to obtain enhanced skills. Operating system (O/S) units allow one-time character upgrades to be made (e.g. permanent health enhancement). An in-game currency called [...] "nanites" [...] may be spent on items at vending machines, including ammunition supplies and health packs. [...] "Quantum Bio-Reconstruction Machines" [...] can be activated and reconstitute the player for 10 nanites if they die inside {{the area in which}} the machine resides. Otherwise, the game ends and progress must be resumed from a save point. The player can hack devices, such as <b>keypads</b> to open alternate areas and vending machines to reduce prices. When a hack is attempted, a minigame begins that features a grid of green nodes; the player must connect three in a straight row to succeed. Optionally, electronic lock picks, called [...] "ICE-picks", can be found that will automatically hack a machine, regardless of its difficulty.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} <b>Keypad,</b> an auditing {{file system}} for theftprone devices, such as laptops and USB sticks. <b>Keypad</b> provides two important properties. First, <b>Keypad</b> supports finegrained file auditing: a user can obtain explicit evidence that no files have been accessed after a device’s loss. Second, a user can disable future file access after a device’s loss, {{even in the}} absence of device network connectivity. <b>Keypad</b> achieves these properties by weaving together encryption and remote key storage. By encrypting files locally but storing encryption keys remotely, <b>Keypad</b> requires the involvement of an audit server with every protected file access. By alerting the audit server to refuse to return a particular file’s key, the user can prevent new accesses after theft. We describe the <b>Keypad</b> architecture, a prototype implementation on Linux, and our evaluation of <b>Keypad’s</b> performance and auditing fidelity. Our results show that <b>Keypad</b> overcomes the challenges posed by slow networks or disconnection, providing clients with usable forensics and control for their (increasingly) missing mobile devices...|$|R

5000|$|Orthogonal regions {{address the}} {{frequent}} {{problem of a}} combinatorial {{increase in the number}} of states when the behavior of a system is fragmented into independent, concurrently active parts. For example, apart from the main <b>keypad,</b> a computer keyboard has an independent numeric <b>keypad.</b> From the previous discussion, recall the two states of the main <b>keypad</b> already identified: [...] "default" [...] and [...] "caps_locked" [...] (see Figure 1). The numeric <b>keypad</b> also can be in two states—"numbers" [...] and [...] "arrows"—depending on whether Num Lock is active. The complete state space of the keyboard in the standard decomposition is therefore the Cartesian product of the two components (main <b>keypad</b> and numeric <b>keypad)</b> and consists of four states: [...] "default-numbers," [...] "default-arrows," [...] "caps_locked-numbers," [...] and [...] "caps_locked-arrows." [...] However, this would be an unnatural representation because the behavior of the numeric <b>keypad</b> does not depend on the state of the main <b>keypad</b> and vice versa. The use of orthogonal regions allows the mixing of independent behaviors as a Cartesian product to be avoided and, instead, for them to remain separate, as shown in Figure 4.|$|R
