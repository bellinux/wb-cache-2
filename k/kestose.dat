5000|$|FOS can be {{produced}} by degradation of inulin, or polyfructose, a polymer of D-fructose residues linked by β(2→1) bonds with a terminal α(1→2) linked D-glucose. The degree of polymerization of inulin ranges from 10 to 60. Inulin can be degraded enzymatically or chemically to a mixture of oligosaccharides with the general structure Glu-Frun [...] (abbrev.

40|$|The genome of Arabidopsis thaliana {{contains}} six putative cell-wall type invertase genes (AtcwINV 1 - 6). Heterologous {{expression of}} AtcwINV 1, 3 and 6 cDNAs in Pichia pastoris {{revealed that the}} enzymes encoded by AtcwINV 3 and 6 did not show invertase activity. Instead, AtcwINV 3 is a 6 -FEH and AtcwINV 6 is a fructan exohydrolase (FEH) that can degrade both inulin and levan-type fructans. For AtcwINV 6 it is proposed {{to use the term}} (6 T 1) FEH. In contrast, AtcwINV 1 is a typical invertase. FEH activity was also detected in crude extracts of different parts of Arabidopsis. To verify that the FEH activity of AtcwINV 3 and 6 were not artefacts of the heterologous expression system, the protein corresponding to AtcwINV 3 was isolated from whole Arabidopsis plants and indeed showed only 6 -FEH activity and no invertase activity.

30|$|It was {{reported}} that some fungi-derived FFases {{had the ability to}} catalyze fructosyl transfer to produce oligosaccharides, whose amounts could increase with increasing substrate concentration (Hirayama et al. 1989). In this study, <b>kestose</b> (GF 2) was the first-formed product in initial reaction time (0.5  h) while the higher molecular weight of oligosaccharides, nystose (GF 3) and fructofuranosyl nystose (GF 4), began to form at later reaction stages. The decrease of the <b>kestose</b> content in late reaction period {{can be attributed to the}} fact that it serves as acceptor for further oligomerization to synthesize nystose and 1 -fructofuranosyl nystose (Dominguez et al. 2014; Rubio and Navarro 2006). On the other hand, the enzyme reaction in 50 % sucrose solution yielded the FOS that was almost entirely accompanied by glucose as the by-product (Table  1). These results indicated that the FFase produced by A. tubingensis XG 21 had a strong transfructosylation activity at high substrate concentration. It is worth mentioning that the pattern of FOS formation by A. tubingensis XG 21 was similar to several other FOS-producing fungi (Hidaka et al. 1988; Shin et al. 2004). Nevertheless, the amount of GF 2 formed at the end of reaction by A. tubingensis XG 21 was less than those with the famous industrial fungus A. niger ATCC 20611 and other newly isolated Aspergillus species (Hidaka et al. 1988; Ganaie et al. 2013), showing its high transfructosylation activity. These results indicated that this peculiar fungus isolated in this study would be valuable for industrial process due to the reduction in the time needed for FOS synthesis.|$|E

The EPS production increased and the relative sucrose hydrolysis activity decreased by increasing the sucrose concentration in the medium. The carbon recovery decreased from 95 % at a sucrose concentration of 30 g liter− 1 to 58 % at a sucrose concentration of 160 g liter− 1 because of the production of an unknown metabolite by L. sanfranciscensis. This metabolite was characterized as a fructo-oligosaccharide. The oligosaccharide produced by L. sanfranciscensis was purified and characterized as a trisaccharide with a glucose/fructose ratio of 1 : 2. The comparison of the retention time of this oligosaccharide and that of pure oligosaccharide standards using two different chromatography methods revealed that the oligosaccharide produced by L. sanfranciscensis LTH 2590 is 1 -kestose. <b>Kestose</b> production increased concomitantly with the initial sucrose concentration in the medium...|$|E

Induction of a {{transport}} {{system can be}} effected by several sugars whose order of effectiveness is: turanose > maltulose > sucrose > d-arabinose, d-fructose, nigerose, maltotriulose, <b>kestose</b> > melezitose, raffinose, nystose, and stachyose. The transport system is not specific to maltose and isomaltose, and it is apparently identical to an induced trehalose permease described previously. Induction of the permease is markedly influenced by spore age—older spores being more responsive. Pure maltose is not absorbed by spores. Absorption of commercial reagent-grade maltose is due to permease induction by maltulose as an impurity. Maltulose contamination of maltose was demonstrated by charcoal column chromatography and comparison of its physical, chemical, and permease-inductive properties with those of authentic maltulose. Maltose accumulates temporarily in spores after absorption and then decreases, although no conversion to glucose can be detected.

By preparing protoplasts from induced leaves, approximately 80 % of the invertase activity was removed with the cell walls while SST was retained. The protoplast homogenate {{was used to}} partially purify and characterize SST. Acid precipitation (pH 4. 75) and anion exchange chromatography (fast protein liquid chromatography on Mono `Q') resulted in a recovery of about 80 % of total SST activity.

30|$|Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) {{represent}} a major class of prebiotics {{and have been}} classified as important functional food ingredients due to their well-recognized nutritional and health benefits (Vancova et al. 2008; Wang 2015). Chemically, FOS are short-chain fructosyl units (F) connected mainly to a terminal sucrose molecule (GF) at the reducing end. The commercial FOS preparations belong exclusively to the inulin-type and exhibit low degrees of polymerization, mainly consisting of <b>kestose</b> (GF 2), nystose (GF 3) and fructofuranosylnystose (GF 4) (Dominguez et al. 2014). They have recently attracted increasing attention in the food and feed industries because of their dominant role in selectively stimulating beneficial intestinal bacteria, such as bifidobacteria (Sangeetha et al. 2005; Ishwarya and Prabhasankar 2013). At present, the major procedure for industrial FOS production is the enzymatic synthesis from sucrose by fungal β-fructofuranosidases (FFase) with high transfructosylation activity (Álvaro-Benito et al. 2007; Wang 2015). FFases are inducible enzymes and sucrose is the most well-known substrate that could induce it. However, costly media components with pure sucrose would likely render the produced enzymes too expensive for FOS synthesis. Being rich in sucrose, sugarcane molasses represents a low-cost alternative carbon source suitable for medium preparation (Miljković et al. 2016). Thus, isolation of novel FFase-producing fungi from a unique molasses habitat would contribute to develop a cost-efficient FOS production process.|$|E

In Cynara scolymus (artichoke) and Echinops ritro (globe thistle), the fructans have a considerably higher degree of polymerization (DP) than in Cichorium intybus (chicory) and Helianthus tuberosus (Jerusalem artichoke). It was shown before that the higher DP in some species {{can be attributed to}} the properties of their fructan: fructan 1 - fructosyl transferases (1 - FFTs; EC 2. 4. 1. 100), enzymes responsible for chain elongation. Here, we describe the cloning of a high DP (hDP) 1 - FFT cDNA from V. discolor and its heterologous expression in Pichia pastoris. Starting from 1 - <b>kestose</b> and Neosugar P (a mixture of oligo- inulins from microbial origin) as substrates, the recombinant enzyme produces a typical hDP inulin profile in vitro, closely resembling the one observed in vivo. The enzyme shows no invertase activity and sucrose: sucrose 1 - fructosyl transferase (1 - SST; EC 2. 4. 1. 99) activity in vitro. Pattern evolution during incubation suggests that inulins with DP >= 6 are much better substrates than sucrose or lower DP oligo- fructans.

These sugar mixtures include FOS, namely <b>kestose</b> (GF 2), nystose (GF 3) and fructo-furanosylnystose (GF 4), but also fructose, glucose and sucrose that must be separated. The major challenge when designing the downstream separation process is the choice of an efficient ion-exchange resin. Therefore, adsorption isotherms of the different compounds on a mixture are an important parameter to consider when selecting the resin. Moreover, salts and other sugars present in the mixture will influence the adsorption.

SDS PAGE analysis revealed two proteins with molecular weights of 112 kDa and 78 kDa, which were identified as a FFase and a hydrolase. Temperature and pH optima of 20 ºC and 9, respectively, were observed for the transfructosylation activity in the FFase. The purified FFase exhibited a half life of 1. 5 hrs under optimal conditions.

The underground reserve organs of yacon accumulate over 60 % (on d. m. basis) of inulin type β (2 → 1) fructans, mainly oligomers (GF 2 –GF 16) (Itaya et al. 2002). The structures of <b>kestose</b> and nystose, the main fructooligosaccha-rides, are given in Figure 1. Fukai et al. (1993, 1997) determined fructan content and the activities of saccharose: saccharose fructan fructosyltransferase (EC 2. 4. 1. 99), fructan: fructan fructosyltransferase (EC 2. 4. 1. 100), and fructan hydrolase in each part of yacon during the growth period. They found that during the summer the amount of fructans accumulated in each part was minimal despite the existence of relatively high specific activities of both transferases in the stems, tuberous roots, and rhizomataceous stems. As Goto et al. (1995) confirmed using enzymatic, C- 13 -NMR, and methylation analyses, the fructooligosaccharides represent mainly oligosaccharides from trisaccha-ride to decasaccharide with terminal saccharose (inulin type fructooligosaccharides). Hermann et al. (1998) reported that yacon fructans are of low molecular mass. Yacon has also significant fructose (3 – 22 % of root dry matter) and glucose (2 – 5 % of root dry matter) contents (Ohyama et al. 1990). The calculated yacon food energy 619 – 937 kJ/kg of fresh matter is very low and has similar properties as dietary fibre (Quemener et al. 1994). The content of individual saccharides in yacon tuberous root is given in Table 2 (Valentová et al. 2001). Factors influencing yields and contents of saccharides in yacon The highest dry matter and fructan yields were observed in dodecaploid lines as compared with octoploid ones. Cisneros-Zevallos et al.

The FFT {{activity was}} free of sucrose:sucrose fructosyltransferase and invertase activities. It had an apparent pI of 4. 7 as determined by isoelectric focusing, and a molecular mass of about 50000 (gel filtration). The FFT activity utilized the trisaccharides 1 -kestose and 6 (G) -kestose as sole substrates, but was not able to use 6 -kestose as sole substrate. The FFT activity was not saturated when assayed at concentrations of 1 -kestose, 6 (G) -kestose or (1, 1) -kestotetraose of up to 400 mM The rate of reaction of the FFT activity was most rapid when assayed with 1 -kestose and was less rapid when assayed with 6 (G) -kestose, (1, 1) -kestotetraose or (1, 1, 1) -kestopentaose. The FFT activity when assayed at a relatively high concentration of enzyme activity (approximately equivalent to about half the activity in crude extracts per gram fresh mass) did not synthesize fructan of degree of polymerization > 6, even during extended assays of up to 10 h. When assayed with a combination of 1 -kestose and uniformly labelled [C- 14]sucrose as substrates, the major reaction was the transfer of a fructosyl residue from 1 -kestose to sucrose resulting in the re-synthesis of 1 -kestose. Tetrasaccharide and 6 (G) -kestose were also synthesized. When assayed with 6 (G) -kestose and [C- 14]sucrose as substrates, the major reaction of the FFT activity was the synthesis of tetrasaccharide. However, some synthesis of 1 -kestose and re-synthesis of 6 (G) -kestose also occurred. When 6, <b>kestose</b> was the sole substrate for the FFT activity, synthesis of tetrasaccharide was 2. 7 to 3. 4 -fold slower than when 1 -kestose was used as the sole substrate. Owing to differences in the fructan:sucrose fructosyltransferase activity of the FFT with each of the trisaccharides, net synthesis of tetrasaccharide by the FFT was altered significantly in the presence of sucrose. The magnitude of this effect depended on the concentration of the trisaccharides. In the presence of sucrose, 6 (G) -kestose could be a substrate of equivalent importance to 1 -kestose for synthesis of tetrasaccharide...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MSc (Genetics. Plant Biotechnology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Carbon {{partitioning}} {{was investigated}} in sugarcane (Saccharum spp. hybrids) that was genetically modified with sucrose: sucrose 1 -fructosyltransferase (1 -SST; EC 2. 4. 1. 99) from Cynara scolymus. This enzyme catalyses the transfer of a fructosyl moiety from one sucrose molecule to another to produce the trisaccharide 1 -kestose. Molecular characterisation of four sugarcane lines, regenerated after transformation, confirmed that two lines (2153 and 2121) were transgenic, {{with at least one}} intact copy of 1 -SST present in line 2153, and a minimum of five copies (or portions thereof) present in line 2121. The novel gene was successfully transcribed and translated in both lines, as confirmed by cDNA gel blot hybridisation and HPLC analysis respectively. <b>Kestose</b> production was stable under field resembling conditions and levels of this trisaccharide progressively increased with increasing internodal maturity from 7. 94 ± 2. 96 nmol. g- 1 fresh mass (fm) in internode 6 to 112. 01 ± 17. 42 nmol. g- 1 fm in internode 16 of 2153, and by 1. 05 ± 0. 93 nmol. g- 1 fm from the youngest to the oldest internode in line 2121. Sugarcane line 2153 contained 100 times more 1 -kestose than 2121 in the oldest sampled internode hence the lines were referred to as high- and low- 1 -kestose producers. The production of 1 -kestose did not reduce sucrose levels in the transgenics, instead they contained significantly higher levels of sucrose than the control line NCo 310 (p 0. 05, N= 72). However, the percentage of total radiolabel in the water-soluble fraction per internode in the high- 1 -kestose producer was significantly higher than the other two lines (p< 0. 01, N= 72). As a result, the percentage radiolabel in the waterinsoluble fraction in this transgenic was concomitantly lower than in the other lines. Carbon was therefore redirected from the water-insoluble fraction to the water-soluble fraction to account for the additive production of 1 -kestose. The expression of 1 -SST in sugarcane therefore established an additional carbohydrate sink by the flow of carbon from the sucrose pool into 1 -kestose. This did not lead to a depletion of the sucrose pool, but rather stimulated carbon channelling into this pathway, thereby increasing the non-structural carbohydrate content of the plant in one of the transgenics. The work described in this study is the first to report on carbon partitioning in 1 - kestose-producing sugarcane grown under field resembling conditions. It contributes significantly to an improved understanding of carbon partitioning in the culm, and demonstrates that an alternative sugar can be produced in sugarcane under field resembling conditions...|$|E
40|$|IPC 2017 - International Scientific Conference Probiotics and PrebioticsIntroduction: Great efforts {{searching for}} new and {{high-quality}} food ingredients {{have been developed to}} meet consumers needs and commercial trends. The high demand for prebiotics is driving the search for new sources of fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) producers and for FOS with differentiated functionalities. The present work explores the possibility of using a new isolated strain from Portuguese grapes, named Aspergillus ibericus MUM 03. 49, as a FOS producer. Methods: FOS were produced in a one-step bioprocess using the whole cells of the microorganism. The temperature of fermentation and initial pH were optimized in shaken flasks to yield a maximal FOS production, through a central composite experimental design. The process was further scaled-up to a 2 L bioreactor. FOS were analyzed by HPLC. The produced FOS prebiotic potential was studied and compared with the ones produced by Aureobasidium pullulans and with a commercially available FOS mixture. The fermentability of these FOS mixtures was evaluated using a number of probiotic bacteria (bifidobacteria and lactobacilli). Finally, the hydrolytic resistance of the different FOS mixtures to the simulated harsh conditions of the digestive system was assessed in vitro. Results: A temperature of 37 ºC and a pH 6. 2 were set by experimental design as the optimal fermentation conditions to produce FOS by A. ibericus. The model (R 2 = 0. 918) predicted a yield of 0. 56 that was experimentally confirmed (0. 53 ± 0. 03 gFOS. ginitial sucrose- 1). A yield of 0. 64 ± 0. 02 gFOS. ginitial sucrose- 1 was obtained in the bioreactor, at 38 h, with a content of 118 ± 4 g. L- 1 in FOS and a purity of 56 ± 3 %. FOS were identified as 1 -kestose, nystose, and 1 F-fructofuranosylnystose. Overall, probiotics preferred the FOS synthesized by A. Ibericus, followed by A. pullulans and lastly the commercial FOS. All mixtures were resistant to salivary fluid. <b>Kestose</b> and nystose were slightly hydrolyzed in the presence of gastric and intestinal fluid. Discussion: The FOS mixture produced was able to stimulate the growth of probiotic strains and was simultaneously resistant to hydrolysis along the simulated harsh conditions of the gastrointestinal system, thus suggesting that it could reach the large intestine intact. Additionally, the fermentation of the prebiotic mixture was found to be both substrate and strain specific, rather than based on the species or genera. The probiotic strains tested preferentially metabolized the FOS mixture synthesized by Aspergillus, followed by the one from A. pullulans and finally the commercial FOS. The one-step fermentation process using the whole cells proved to be efficient, fast and economic. The results gathered in this study highlight the possibility of using the fungus A. ibericus as a prebiotic producer at a large scale since high yields of FOS were achieved as compared to other microorganisms described in the literature. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{the work}} {{presented}} in this dissertation was to explore the possibility to genetically manipulate the sucrose storing crops, sugarcane and sweet sorghum, to convert their sucrose reserves into higher-value alternatives. For {{the purpose of this}} study we focussed on fructans as alternative sucrose-based high-value carbohydrates, since these fructose polymers are of significant commercial interest. To investigate the technical feasibility of transforming sugarcane and sweet sorghum to produce this novel carbohydrate, we proposed to transfer the fructosyltransferase genes from Cynara scolymus into these plants by means of particle bombardment. In order to apply this technology to sweet sorghum, an in vitro culture system suitable for transformation had to be established. For this purpose an extensive screening process with different combinations of variables were conducted. Though the relationships between these variables proved to be complex, it was concluded that immature zygotic embryos could be used to initiate a genotype-independent totipotent regeneration system with a 65 % callus induction rate, provided that initiation takes place during summer. Stable transformation and regeneration of these calli were however not successful and will have to be optimised to allow future applications. By introducing fructosyltransferase genes into sugarcane, we succeeded in transforming sugarcane into a crop that produces a variety of fructans of the inulintype. Low molecular weight (LMW) inulins were found to accumulate in the mature internodes of 42 % of the transgenic sugarcane plants expressing the sucrose:sucrose 1 -fructosyltransferase (1 -SST) gene, and in 77 % of the plants that incorporated both 1 -SST and fructan:fructan 1 -fructosyltransferase (1 -FFT), while only 8 % of these plants accumulated high molecular weight (HMW) inulins. Our results demonstrated that sugarcane could be manipulated to synthesise and accumulate fructans without the induction of phenotypical irregularities. Inulins with a degree of polymerisation up to 60 were found in sugarcane storage tissue. In these HMW inulin-producing plants, up to 78 % of the endogenous sucrose in the mature sugarcane culm was converted to inulin. This enabled inulin accumulation up to 165. 3 mg g- 1 fresh weight (FW), which is comparable to that found in native plants. These transgenic sugarcane plants, therefore exhibit great potential as a future industrial inulin source. Fructan production was detected in all the sugarcane plant tissue tested, predominantly as 1 -kestose. In contrast with the fact that fructan accumulation in leaves did not affect the endogenous sucrose concentrations in these organs, the sucrose content of mature internodes that accumulated high levels of 1 -kestose was severely reduced. However, increases in total sugar content, in some instances up to 63 % higher than control plants, were observed. This phenomenon was investigated with the use of radio-labelled-isotopes. An increase in the allocation of incoming carbon towards sucrose storage, resulting in higher carbon partitioning into both 1 - <b>kestose</b> and sucrose, were detected in the culms of transgenic compared to control lines. This modification therefore established an extra carbohydrate sink in the vacuoles that affected photosynthate partitioning and increased total soluble sugar content. The data suggests that sucrose sensing is the main regulatory mechanism responsible for adapting carbon flow in the cells to maintain sucrose concentration...|$|E
40|$|The gut {{microbiota}} play {{a significant}} role in human health and nutrition, although the mechanisms these organisms use to survive in this densely populated environment are not well understood. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is a dominant member of the gut bacterial community whose genome sequence reveals large expansions in protein families involved in the sensing, acquisition and utilisation of complex carbohydrates, pointing to the ability to access a wide range of glycans as playing a significant role in becoming a successful resident of the human gut. Here we have characterised components of the B. thetaiotaomicron polysaccharide utilisation apparatus at molecular level, focusing mainly on fructan sensing, binding and degradation systems. Microarray data from our collaborators revealed that growth of B. thetaiotaomicron on inulin (β- 2, 1 -linked fructan) specifically upregulated a locus of nine genes BT 1757 -BT 1765 and an orphan gene BT 3082, encoding a glycoside hydrolase from family 32 (GH 32). The locus contains three other GH 32 s, two predicted polysaccharide binding outer membrane proteins (SusC and SusD homologues), a fructokinase, and an inner membrane monosaccharide transporter. Together these components form a polysaccharide utilisation locus (PUL). The nearest regulatory gene to the PUL is BT 1754, a hybrid two component system. Here we show that the periplasmic sensor domain of BT 1754 (BT 1754 peri) binds specifically to fructose, with a Kd of ~ 2 μM and a stoichiometry of 1 : 1, but not fructooligosaccharides or other monosaccharides. The crystal structure of BT 1754 peri revealed a two domain periplasmic binding protein (PBP) -fold with the ligand fructose sandwiched between the two domains. BT 1754 is the first periplasmic sensor histidine kinase domain to display a non-PAS fold. The structure in combination with biophysical and site-directed mutagenesis studies also shows how the protein displays such specificity in ligand recognition and provides insights into the mechanism of signal transduction across the inner membrane. The four glycoside hydrolase family 32 members regulated by BT 1754 were also biochemically and structurally characterised in this thesis. Three of four GH 32 enzymes BT 1759, BT 1765 and BT 3082, digest both β- 2, 1 -linked (inulin) and β- 2, 6 -linked (levan) fructans, indicating that levan is also utilised by the same locus. BT 1759 and BT 3082 are exo-acting enzymes releasing fructose from both long-chain and short-chain inulins and levans, while BT 1765 is also exo-acting and produces fructose, but preferred short-chain sugars. BT 1760 is unusual for GH 32 as it is specific for levan and has an endo-like activity, releasing a range of different size oligosaccharides from the polysaccharide. The crystal structures of wild type BT 3082 and a nucleophile mutant in complex with substrate (<b>kestose)</b> were solved to 2. 2 Å and revealed a typical GH 32 β-propeller fold as the catalytic domain. Like all other GH 32 s solved to date, the enzyme has a C-terminal β-sheet domain of unknown function that was shown to be necessary for correct folding of the enzyme. BT 3082 also has a unique N-terminal β-sheet domain that was shown to be essential for enzyme activity but not correct folding. Extensive site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to provide insight into the relative importance of different residues in substrate binding and catalysis in BT 3082. The crystal structure of wild type BT 1760 was solved to 2. 6 Å, revealing a surprisingly similar structure to that of the exo-acting enzymes. A rationale for the endo-like activity of this enzyme and the role each of the four GH 32 s in fructan utilisation by B. thetaiotaomicron is discussed. The outer membrane SusD homologue BT 1762 from the fructan locus was shown to bind preferentially to long chain levans, with no recognition of inulin. The crystal structure of BT 1762 was solved to 1. 9 Å and was shown to share the same novel α-helical fold as SusD. Site-directed mutagenesis of a number of residues in the same region as the SusD binding site showed that while the location of the ligand binding sites are conserved between these two proteins, the identity of the residues involved in polysaccharide recognition are not the same. A model is proposed for levan recognition in BT 1762 and also its role in polysaccharide utilisation. B. thetaiotaomicron also has at least 12 ECF sigma/anti-sigma factor gene pairs likely involved in polysaccharide utilisation. Here we show that these systems form a trans-envelope signalling apparatus with their cognate SusC-transducer homologue, but that there is no cross talk between different systems. The significance of this finding in relation to survival of this important gut bacterium is discussed.
