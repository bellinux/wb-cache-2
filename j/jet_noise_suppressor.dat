Although {{the suppression of}} jet noise over {{the entire range of}} directivity angles is of interest, the suppression of the peak noise level in the rear quadrant is frequently of the most interest. Consequently, the paper is directed primarily to the inflight effects at the peak noise level. Both single and inverted-velocity-profile multistream suppressor nozzles are considered.

Jet noise suppression and spectral {{characteristics of the}} divergent, lobed, suppressor (DLS) nozzle with and without an ejector are presented. Suppression was obtained at nozzle pressure ratios of 2. 5 to 4. 0. The largest, maximum-lobe, sound pressure level suppression with a hard-wall ejector was 14. 6 decibels at a nozzle pressure ratio of 3. 5. The thrust loss was 2 percent. In general, low-frequency jet noise was suppressed, leaving higher frequencies essentially unchanged.

The elimination of the 'shock associated noise' and 'screeching' is accomplished by equalization of pressure along the jet axis. Because of the geometrical features of the porous plug nozzle, shear noise reductions are also observed at all subsonic and supersonic flow conditions tested. Additional benefits are the localization of the noise sources in the flow and the reduction of the spatial scale {{of the structure of the}} jet flow, which enhance the performance of an acoustic shield or baffle...|$|E
40|$|Reducing {{the noise}} {{generated}} by high velocity jets has confronted engine designers and acoustics workers alike {{for the past}} fifteen years.

Some significant progress was made as the result of work supported by NASA and FAA in the past two to three years.

40|$|The {{thrust loss}} and noise {{suppression}} of a divergent-lobe supersonic <b>jet</b> <b>noise</b> <b>suppressor</b> were experimentally determined over {{a range of}} nozzle pressure ratios of 1. 5 to 4. 0. These small-scale cold flow tests were made {{to determine the effect}} on thrust and noise of: suppressor length, rearward facing step height, suppressor divergence angle, and ejector shroud length and location. Noise suppression was achieved at nozzle pressure ratios of 2. 5 and greater. Maximum lobe jet noise attenuation of 15 db with thrust loss differences of 1. 5 percent compared to the convergent nozzle were obtained at a nozzle pressure ratio of 3. 5 with an ejector shroud two nozzle diameters long. Without the ejector the attenuation was 13 db with thrust loss differences of 11 percent. Short suppressors approximately one primary nozzle throat diameter long performed as well as longer suppressors. Rearward facing step height had a significant effect on noise suppression.

40|$|A {{parametric}} {{study was}} made of duct-burning turbofan and suppressed dry turbojet engines installed in a supersonic transport. A range of fan pressure ratios was considered for the separate-flow-fan engines. The turbofan engines were studied both with and without <b>jet</b> <b>noise</b> <b>suppressors.</b> Single- as well as dual-stream suppression was considered. Attention was concentrated on designs yielding sideline noises of FAR 36 (108 EPNdB) and below. Trades were made between thrust and wing area for a constant takeoff field length. The turbofans produced lower airplane gross weights than the turbojets at FAR 36 and below. The advantage for the turbofans increased as the sideline noise limit was reduced. <b>Jet</b> <b>noise</b> suppression, especially for the duct stream, was very beneficial for the turbofan engines as long as duct burning was permitted during takeoff. The maximum dry unsuppressed takeoff mode, however, yielded better results at extremely low noise levels. Noise levels as low as FAR 36 - 11 EPNdB were obtained with a turbofan in this takeoff mode, but at a considerable gross weight penalty relative to the best FAR 36 results...|$|R
40|$|A {{simplified}} {{study was}} made in which the mission performances of three Mach 2. 7 airplane configurations were compared. Both wing loading {{and size of the}} unaugmented turbojet engines were varied at different levels of suppressor technology. The lowest gross weight and the best return on investment were obtained with an advanced arrow wing configuration when a mission range of 4200 nautical miles was specified. This comparison was made for the takeoff noise levels specified in F. A. R. 36 using retractable <b>jet</b> <b>noise</b> <b>suppressors</b> assumed to be capable of 15 PNdb of suppression with only a 7. 5 -percent thrust loss. With less advanced suppressor technology, a modified delta configuration is a close competitor of the arrow wing. Despite its good takeoff characteristics, a swing-wing configuration was too structurally heavy to be competitive at F. A. R. 36 noise levels. Engine performance and weight commensurate with engine definition in 1975 were postulated...|$|R

The relationship of these programs to other efforts by Douglas to develop quieter CTOL airplanes is briefly outlined. The engine/nacelle concepts studied were: (1) application of nacelle acoustic treatment, (2) variable-area exhaust nozzles, (3) <b>jet</b> exhaust <b>noise</b> <b>suppressors,</b> and (4) engines with larger-diameter new front fans. Acoustic analyses leading to the selection of certain engine/nacelle configurations are described, as well as design constraints which limit the noise reduction capability of certain designs.

40|$|The {{aeroacoustics}} of a {{porous plug}} <b>jet</b> <b>noise</b> <b>suppressor</b> was investigated. The predicted flow features of isentropic plug nozzles for different pressure ratios or exit flow Mach numbers, throat areas, ratios of the plug to annular nozzle radii, mass flow {{rates and the}} available run times possible with the existing compressed air supply system, are compiled. The dimensions and the coordinates of the contour of typical isentropic external expansion plugs with different exit flow Mach numbers are listed. Design details of the experimental facility and the plug nozzle selected for experimental aeroacoustic studies are reported. The analytical flow prediction by method of characteristics of a conical porous plug nozzles is initiated. The role of the shape, size, and porosity of the plug surface in achieving over a perforated conical plug a nearly isentropic shockfree supersonic flow field which is closely similar to the flow field of a contoured isentropic plug nozzle is examined...|$|E
40|$|The {{challenge}} to meet or better FAR 36 noise level requirements is particularly {{difficult in the}} SST due to the relatively high jet velocities required to give an acceptable supersonic powerplant. This requires careful tailoring of the powerplant cycle to give good flight performance with a jet velocity low enough to meet the noise requirements with a practical <b>jet</b> <b>noise</b> <b>suppressor.</b> The effect on engine cycle selection of meeting various noise levels will be reviewed. The range of engine cycles will cover turbojet and turbofan cycles, as well as variable cycle engines. The selection of the cycle parameters such as turbine temperature, bypass ratio, and fan pressure ratio as required to meet various noise levels will be reviewed. The effect on the engine design of jet noise suppression and engine acoustic treatment will also be reviewed. The impact of designing the engines at the different noise levels will be evaluated on an overall supersonic transport systems basis...|$|E
40|$|The {{papers in}} this volume deal {{essentially}} with the question whether the amplification of noise {{is due to the}} jet noise phenomenon or perhaps an interaction of airframe and core engine noise. In the area of jet noise suppression, various promising suppressor concepts are examined. The swirling flow <b>jet</b> <b>noise</b> <b>suppressor</b> is shown to provide significant noise reduction with minimal thrust losses. Progress in the aircraft engine core noise problem is reflected by seven research-type papers. Two possible mechanisms are seen to be responsible for core noise. One is the direct noise radiated from the turbulent combustion in the primary combuster and transmitted through the turbine, passing out the nozzle into the far field. The other mechanism is the noise that is emitted from hot spots being convected through the turbine. Which of these mechanisms (or perhaps both mechanisms) is responsible for core noise, and what are the coupling mechanisms of core engine noise and jet noise are the questions confronting researchers...|$|E
40|$|An {{examination}} {{was made}} of several published <b>jet</b> <b>noise</b> studies {{for the purpose of}} evaluating scale effects important to the simulation of jet aeroacoustics. Several studies confirmed that small conical jets, one as small as 59 mm diameter, could be used to correctly simulate the overall or perceived noise level (PNL) <b>noise</b> of large <b>jets</b> dominated by mixing noise. However, the detailed acoustic spectra of large jets are more difficult to simulate {{because of the lack of}} broad-band turbulence spectra in small jets. One study indicated that a jet Reynolds number of 5 x 10 (exp 6) based on exhaust diameter enabled the generation of broad-band noise representative of large <b>jet</b> mixing <b>noise.</b> <b>Jet</b> <b>suppressor</b> aeroacoustics is even more difficult to simulate at small scale because of the small mixer nozzles with flows sensitive to Reynolds number. Likewise, one study showed incorrect ejector mixing and entrainment using a small-scale, short ejector that led to poor acoustic scaling. Conversely, fairly good results were found with a longer ejector and, in a different study, with a 32 -chute suppressor nozzle. Finally, it was found that small-scale aeroacoustic resonance produced by jets impacting ground boards does not reproduce at large scale...|$|R
40|$|Older {{commercial}} aircraft often exceed FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) sideline noise regulations. The major {{problem is the}} <b>jet</b> <b>noise</b> associated with the high exhaust velocities of the low bypass ratio engines on such aircraft. Mixer/ejector exhaust systems can provide a simple means of reducing the <b>jet</b> <b>noise</b> on these aircraft by mixing cool ambient air with the high velocity engine gases before they are exhausted to ambient. This paper presents new information on thrust performance predictions, and thrust augmentation capabilities of mixer/ejectors. Results are presented from the recent development program of the patented Alternating Lobe Mixer Ejector Concept (ALMEC) suppressor system for the Gulfstream GII, GIIB and GIII aircraft. Mixer/ejector performance procedures are presented which include classical control volume analyses, compound compressible flow theory, lobed nozzle loss correlations and {{state of the art}} computational fluid dynamic predictions. The mixer/ejector thrust predictions are compared to subscale wind tunnel test model data and actual aircraft flight test measurements. The results demonstrate that a properly designed mixer/ejector <b>noise</b> <b>suppressor</b> can increase effective engine bypass ratio and generate large thrust gains at takeoff conditions with little or no thrust loss at cruise conditions. The cruise performance obtained for such <b>noise</b> <b>suppressor</b> systems is shown to be a strong function of installation effects on the aircraft...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a unique, detailed {{evaluation of the}} acoustics and aerodynamics of a rectangular multi-element supersonic <b>jet</b> mixer-ejector <b>noise</b> <b>suppressor.</b> The performance of such mixer-ejectors is important in aircraft engine application for noise suppression and thrust augmentation. In contrast to most prior experimental studies on ejectors that reported either aerodynamic or acoustic data, our work documents both types of data. We present information on the mixing, pumping, ejector wall pressure distribution, thrust augmentation and noise suppression characteristics of four simple, multi-element, jet mixer-ejector configurations. The four configurations included the effect of ejector area ratio (AR = ejector area/primary jet area) {{and the effect of}} non-parallel ejector walls. We also studied in detail the configuration that produced the best noise suppression characteristics. Our results show that ejector configurations that produced the maximum maximum pumping (entrained flow per secondary inlet area) also exhibited the lowest wall pressures in the inlet region, and the maximum thrust augmentation. When cases having the same total mass flow were compared, we found that noise suppression trends corresponded with those for pumping. Surprisingly, the mixing (quantified by the peak Mach number, and flow uniformity) at the ejector exit exhibited no relationship to the noise suppression at moderate primary jet fully expanded Mach numbers (Mj is less than 1. 4). However, the noise suppression dependence on the mixing was apparent at higher Mj. The above observations are justified by noting that the mixing at the ejector exit is ot a strong factor in determining the radiated noise when noise produced internal to the ejector dominates the noise field outside the ejector...|$|R
40|$|The {{flight and}} wind tunnel tests to {{determine}} the acoustic and performance effects of a mechanical <b>jet</b> <b>noise</b> <b>suppressor</b> nozzle mounted on a Viper engine of an HS- 125 airplane are discussed. Flyover noise measurements were made with microphones mounted {{on top of a}} 137. 5 m bridge tower. Seven nozzle configurations including two references nozzles, two suppressors, and three ejector inlets were tested. The suppressor nozzle of interest for an advanced supersonic transport, the suppressor/treated ejector, achieved a measured noise reduction of 14 EPNdB relative to a conventional conical reference nozzle at the highest pressure ratio tested (approximately 2. 5). The unique engine nacelle, flight hardware, and nacelles from the HS- 125 flight test program, combined with a simulated HS- 125 fuselage were windtunnel tested. Both propulsion and acoustic data were recorded. Preliminary thrust data results from the wind tunnel tests are summarized and compared to other mechanical suppressor test results. The test results indicate that a noise reduction of at least 16 EPNdB would be possible for the suppressor/ejector nozzle scaled to typical AST engine size with a 5 % thrust loss at a typical takeoff climb speed...|$|E
40|$|A {{critical}} part of the NASA High-Speed Research (HSR) program is the demonstration of satisfactory suppression of the jet noise present at low airspeeds. One scheme for reducing jet exhaust noise generated by a future High-Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) {{is the use of}} a mixer/ ejector system which would entrain large quantities of ambient air into the exhaust flow from the powerplant in order to cool and slow the jet exhaust before it leaves the tailpipe. Of the variety of factors which can affect the noise suppression characteristics of the mixer/ejector system, the influence of the wing flow field and high-lift devices is not well understood. The effectiveness of the noise suppression device must be evaluated {{in the presence of the}} wing/high-lift system before definitive assessments can be made concerning HSCT noise. Of nearly equal importance is the evaluation of the performance of the high-lift system(s) in the presence of realistic propulsion units which feature high ambient flow entrainment rates and jet thrust coefficients. These noise suppressors must provide the required acoustic attenuation while not overly degrading the thrust efficiency of the propulsion system or the lift enhancement of the high-lift devices on the wing. The overall objective of the NASA High-lift Engine Aeroacoustics Technology program is to demonstrate satisfactory interaction between the <b>jet</b> <b>noise</b> <b>suppressor</b> and the high-lift system at airspeeds and angles of attack consistent with takeoff, climb, approach, and landing. In support of this program, an isolated aeroacoustic test of a 13. 5 %-scale, candidate mixer/ejector nozzle was performed in the Ames' Research Center 40 - by 80 -Foot Wind Tunnel. The purpose of the test was to measure the baseline aeroacoustic performance characteristics of this nozzle in isolation from the aerodynamic flowfield induced by an HSCT airframe. The test documented the acoustic signature of the nozzles with treated and hardwall ejector surfaces and with changes in the ratio of ejector-duct-to-jet-area over a wide range range of nozzle pressure ratios and freestream Mach numbers. The test also measured the thrust performance, ambient-flow aspiration ratio, and internal and external static pressures on the nozzles. The isolated aeroacoustic performance data has been compared with results obtained with this nozzle installed on a 13. 5 % Boeing Reference H HSCT configuration, semi-span model. The semi-span, aeroacoustics integration test documented the first-order effects of the airframe flowfield on the acoustic performance of the nozzle and the effect of the nozzle secondary inlet flows on the aerodynamic performance of the wing high-lift systems. This investigation is critical to understanding the mutual installation effects of mixer/ejector nozzles and wing high-lift systems...|$|E

40|$|<b>Jet</b> <b>noise</b> {{measurements}} {{have been}} acquired at many anechoic jet-facilities around the world. These measurements {{have been used}} to form the basis for prediction schemes and to understand the generation and radiation of <b>jet</b> <b>noise.</b> Often, when <b>jet</b> <b>noise</b> measurements from different jet-facilities that are thought to be acquired at or corrected to similar conditions are compared, differences are observed in the spectra. These comparisons are typically performed {{on the basis of the}} same nozzle-exit diameter, jet velocity, microphone distance from the jet flow, and ambient conditions. This phenomenon has spurred much discussion in the aeroacoustics community, with some even claiming that some of the measurements are contaminated with rig-noise. This study investigates following four factors that can be responsible for the differences in <b>jet</b> <b>noise</b> measurements: (1) rig noise contamination, (2) the jet’s Reynolds number, (3) the nozzle-exit boundary layer of the jet, and (4) reflections and shielding from surfaces inside the anechoic jet-facility.
