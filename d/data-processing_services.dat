Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS), relying on the newest and foreseeable further developments of computer science, information and communication technologies on the one hand, and of manufacturing science and technology, on the other, may lead to the 4 th Industrial Revolution, frequently noted as Industrie 4. 0.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the economic}} impacts of R&D inputs. In the model employed, sectoral TFP growth {{is determined by}} the direct impact of R&D inputs on the volume of production via the improvement in the quality of production {{as well as by the}} diffusion of new technology through purchases of investment goods both domestically and from abroad. The effects of increases in R&D inputs and productivity are transmitted to domestic demand mainly through wage and private consumption growth and to exports via improved export competitiveness. Model simulations show that the impact on competitiveness and export volume dominates the overall effect on GDP growth because an increase in R&D inputs boosts productivity in industry the most. An increase in the R&D intensity of the economy also leads to positive employment effects. Looking at the effects of sectoral R&D inputs, the paper shows that the machinery industry, <b>data-processing</b> <b>services</b> and the electronic equipment industry are the most effective in terms of their impact on national productivity. Raising R&D inputs in the forest industry and the machinery industry yield the greatest impact on GDP, employment, net exports and public sector tax revenue. research and development, productivity, economic impacts...|$|E
40|$|An {{efficient}} automated {{simulation of}} the transport-limited electrolysis in a channel flow cell, {{based on the}} multigrid method, is developed and is used to compute the working curve for the transport-limited current within the Lévêque approximation. An accurate universal two-dimensional working surface (making neither the Lévêque approximation nor ignoring axial diffusion) is presented for the steady-state transport-limited current from which the simulated response may be interpolated. The multigrid simulation is extended to include homogenous ECE kinetics and a working surface is presented for analysis of this mechanism within the Lévêque approximation. This is then modified using a Gauss-Newton method to solve the nonlinear EC 2 E system for which an analogous working surface is generated. The effect of axial diffusion on the measurement of rate constants for these mechanisms is discussed. The merits of bilinear, cubic convolution, bicubic spline, and artificial neural network methods are assessed as interpolation methods for working surfaces. Working surface interpolation is {{shown to be a}} viable cost-effective alternative to repeated simulation methods, especially for problems of more than one dimension. A free <b>data-processing</b> <b>service</b> using the working surface data together with a suitable interpolation method is available via the World Wide Web ([URL] physchem. ox. ac. uk: 8000 /wwwda) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to evaluate the process and impact of outsourcing information technology (IT) services of Eastern Cape Treasury Department (ECTD) to State Information Technology Agency (SITA). This research study has been prompted {{by the fact that the}} South African Government through the National Department of Public Service and Administration has established SITA with a sole purpose of improving service delivery by all national, provincial and local government departments. The researcher’s concern is whether the relationship between SITA and these departments is working or not. The research paradigm adopted is a constructivist approach and the ontological position adopted assumed multiple realities. The research method used in this study is the evaluation research method. Key to the research procedure was the fact that four senior officials were interviewed using audio recording, where in two were each chosen from SITA and ECTD. The researcher used document analysis and interviews as a means of collecting data. Separate open-ended questions for SITA and ECTD were structured in such a way that it would be easy to extract themes describing the details of a particular question. The researcher made use of thematic analysis. The theory drive-code development process was key in the research analysis. ECTD outsourced to SITA the following IT services, namely, provision or maintenance of a private telecommunication network (PTN) or a value-added network (VAN); transversal information systems and its data-processing or associated services; training in IT/IS; application software development; maintenance services for IT software or infrastructure; <b>data-processing</b> or associated <b>services</b> for specific IT applications or systems such as website development; and IT support. The interviewed officials from ECTD contend that they used the SCM Guide and SITA ACT when pursuing IT outsourcing for projects such as those listed above. One of the key projects outsourced to SITA is the IFMS, which is a project programme of the National Treasury Department working closely with provinces (e. g. ECTD), National Department of Public Service and Administration (NDPSA) and SITA. The IFMS project has been implemented following the SCM guidelines. The key SCM Guide components are demand, acquisition, logistics, and disposal management. The engagement model used by SITA to guide them on the process of engaging in an IT outsourcing relationship has, according to the officials interviewed, been a success. SITA uses a standard contract wherein other specific contracts receive minor adjustments. The impact of IT outsourcing has shown increases in customer satisfaction improvement, transformation of government procurement and provisioning practices, appointment of Consultants, interpretation of the Preferential Procurement Policy, promotion of the consistent application of Best Practices, information systems security environment, and improving service delivery...|$|R
