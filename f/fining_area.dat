40|$|In this paper, a new {{adaptive}} method for Catmull-Clark subdivision is introduced. Adaptive subdivision refines {{specific areas of}} a model according to user or application needs. Naive adaptive subdivision algorithm change the connectivity of the mesh, causing geometrical inconsistencies that alter the limit surface. Our method expands the specified region of the mesh such that when it is adaptively subdivided, it produces a smooth surface whose selected area is identical to when the entire mesh is refined. This technique also produces a surface with an increasing level of detail from coarse to <b>fine</b> <b>areas</b> of the surface. We compare our adaptive subdivision with other schemes and present some example applications. 1...|$|R

This is accomplished through filter feeding, using the krill's highly developed front legs, providing for an efficient filtering apparatus: the six thoracopods (legs {{attached to the}} thorax) form a very effective [...] "feeding basket" [...] used to collect phytoplankton from the open water. In the <b>finest</b> <b>areas</b> the openings in this basket are only 1μm in diameter.

40|$|Constructing {{a smooth}} {{surface of a}} 3 D object is an {{important}} problem in many graphics applications. Subdivision methods permit to pass easily from a discrete mesh to a continuous surface. A generic problem arising from subdividing two meshes initially connected along a common boundary is the occurrence of cracks or holes between them. Therefore, we propose a new method for joining two meshes with different resolutions using a tangent plane local approximation and a Lifted B-spline wavelet transform. This method generates a connecting mesh where continuity is controlled from one boundary to the other. This guarantees that the discrete continuity between these mesh areas is preserved and the connecting mesh can change gradually in resolution between coarse and <b>fine</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceFine scale {{microstructure}} and hardness {{properties of}} bulk Zn-Al-Mg alloys {{have been investigated}} after solution-annealing, during ageing at room temperature and after ageing at 95 degrees C. Small-angle X-ray scattering measurements evidence nucleation, growth and coarsening of tiny elongated precipitates (probably of the (Al) phase) in Zn-Al-Mg alloys during ageing, with a characteristic size of 10 nm, and a characteristic time scale of 1 h at 95 degrees C to complete the precipitation reaction. Small additions of magnesium strongly enhance this precipitation. A strong effect on both hardness and two-stage precipitation enthalpy was evidenced. The nodules of both alpha-(Al) and eta-(Zn) phases formed by decomposition of the former alpha' phase showed a bimodal size distribution. An ageing treatment at 15 and 95 degrees C mainly affected the bulk of former alpha' particles i. e. the <b>finest</b> <b>areas</b> of this microstructure...|$|R

40|$|A {{morphological}} {{study of}} the stomach of the falcon was carried out, grossly and under light microscopy. Anatomically, the stomach of the falcon is constituted by two externally distinguishable chambers: a cranial chamber, the proventriculus (pars glandularis), which is cranially connected to the esophagus and caudally, to the gizzard (ventriculus or pars muscularis). There is no papilla on the gastric epithelium surface of the proventricular. Both, the mucous tunic of the proventriculus and of the gizzard present folds lined by simple columnar epithelium. The tunica mucosa of the proventriculus is extensively folded due {{to the presence of}} well-developed longitudinal muscle bundles. There is no intermediate zone (isthmus) between the proventriculus and the gizzard. The luminal surface of the ventriculus have cuticle, which is sloughed and shed small <b>fine</b> <b>area</b> (around the pyloric opening) and very thin membrane and highly closely adherent to the lining surface of gizzard...|$|R

40|$|This article {{draws on}} {{a model of}} {{reflection}} that involves creating meanings through repeated encounters with evocative objects. Responses to one such evocative object, a 20 -second video clip of children playing in the <b>fine</b> sand <b>area,</b> illustrates the “turning toward” and then “turning away” from the object to engage with broader themes. Parten’s play types are used when analyzing children’s play in the <b>fine</b> sand <b>area</b> (the evocative object). The focus then turns away to themes of English as a second language, messy play, energies of childhood, and Foucault’s docile bodies. The intention was to integrate loosely formulated research aims relating to quality of the physical environment within the evolving life of the nursery setting to encourage a developing research orientation and reflective dis-position. This way of approaching practitioner research is well adapted to a longer-term engagement with enduring areas of interest, such as developing {{the potential of the}} physical environment...|$|R
