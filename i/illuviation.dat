50|$|Cutans are the {{modification}} of the soil texture, or soil structure, at natural surfaces (particle, pore, or ped) in soil materials due to <b>illuviation.</b> Cutans are oriented deposits which can be composed {{of any of the}} component substances of the soil material. Cutans are common features in soil and represent focuses of chemical and biological reactions. Cutans may include clay skins or coatings of silica, sesquioxide, manganese, ferromanganese, soil organic matter or carbonate. Clay skins are also called argillans, and soil horizons with sufficient clay <b>illuviation</b> are termed argillic horizons.|$|E
5000|$|Clay Cutans {{inherently}} indicate <b>illuviation</b> {{and therefore}} may {{indicate the presence}} of a petroleum seal in an underlying layer if silica had been transported to that depth. The J2 sandstone in Medicine River Gas Field in Alberta, Canada was cemented in such a manner.|$|E
50|$|These sub-processes include mobilisation, {{eluviation}} and <b>illuviation.</b> Mobilisation and eluviation both move {{organic materials}} and minerals through the A horizon into the B horizon. During this, they react {{with the water}} (<b>illuviation)</b> to become oxidised. This process of podzolisation results in the characteristic soil profile of spodosols, in which the E horizon is usually an ashen grey or white colour without structure {{and there is a}} distinctive hardpan oxide layer in the B horizon (which is always darker than the E horizon). The E horizon can be dark grey in profiles which are high in organic matter, but in such cases the underlying B is very dark. Spodosols over mafic rock may have a medium brown E horizon underlain by a darker B.|$|E
50|$|Dispersive {{soils are}} more common in older landscapes where {{leaching}} and <b>illuviation</b> processes have {{had more time to}} work. A source of sodium is also required. Possible sources can include weathering from soil parent materials or wind-blown salt deposition. Sodium ions are highly mobile in the soil solution and so they accumulate in the lower parts of the landscape.|$|E
50|$|However, as {{conifers}} allelopathically reduce competition {{by producing}} a thick O horizon of mor (acidic and poisonous leaf litter that is slow to decompose), the primary form of plant-soil interactions {{is that of}} the conifers themselves. The acidic O horizon, along with rainfall patterns that are {{similar to that of the}} moister grasslands, also promotes the <b>illuviation</b> of oxides of aluminium and iron.|$|E
5000|$|These horizons {{are also}} heavily organic, but are {{distinct}} from O horizons {{in that they}} form under waterlogged conditions. The [...] "P" [...] designation comes from their common name, peats. They may be divided into P1 and P2 {{in the same way}} as O Horizons. This layer accumulates iron, clay, aluminium and organic compounds, a process referred to as <b>illuviation.</b>|$|E
50|$|In pedology, {{leaching}} is {{the loss}} of mineral and organic solutes due to very heavy rainfall, high temperature and percolation. It is a mechanism of soil formation distinct from the soil forming process of eluviation, which {{is the loss}} of mineral and organic colloids. Leached and elluviated materials tend to be lost from topsoil and deposited in subsoil. A soil horizon accumulating leached and eluviated materials is referred to as a zone of <b>illuviation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Illuvium is {{material}} displaced {{across a}} soil profile, from one layer to another one, by {{the action of}} rainwater. The removal of material from a soil layer is called eluviation. The transport of the material may be either mechanical or chemical. The process of deposition of illuvium is termed <b>illuviation.</b> It is a water-assisted transport in a basically vertical direction, as compared to alluviation, the horizontal running water transfer. The resulting deposits are called illuvial deposits. Cutans are a type of illuvial deposit.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} removal of {{materials}} from geological or soil horizons is called eluviation or leaching. There {{is a difference}} in the usage of this term in geology and soil science. In soil science, eluviation is the transport of soil material from upper layers of soil to lower levels by downward precipitation of water across soil horizons, and accumulation of this material (illuvial deposit) in lower levels is called <b>illuviation.</b> In geology, the removed material is irrelevant, and the deposit (eluvial deposit) is the remaining material. Eluviation occurs when precipitation exceeds evaporation.|$|E
50|$|During biostasy, {{abundant}} and regular precipitation induces strong pedogenesis characterized by chemical alteration of parent material and intensified eluviation and <b>illuviation</b> of soil minerals within the surface soil and subsoil layers (the solum). These processes {{contribute to the}} formation of eluvial and argillic horizons and an increased concentration of iron oxides, aluminum oxides, and other sesquioxides in the subsoil. Climatic conditions favor a vegetative cover which protects the soil from physical erosion but abundant rainfall results in the loss of mineral ions and increased concentration of those minerals in receiving bodies of water. Abundant marine calcium results in limestone formation.|$|E
50|$|In podsolisation, {{chelating}} agents break down clay and release minerals such as iron and aluminium. When iron and aluminium are hydrated they become sesquioxides. The sesquioxides are translocated from the A Horizon, {{a zone of}} out-washing, to the B Horizon, a zone of <b>illuviation.</b> Many bases such as Calcium and Potassium are also leached from the zone along with organic matter and silica. Often minerals like quartz and silica are {{left behind in the}} A horizon. What is significantly different about podsols in comparison to other soils is that the bottom of A horizon is known as the AE horizon, which is an eluviated area which has lost sesquioxides. It tends to be an ash gray colour.|$|E
5000|$|The US soil taxonomic {{hierarchy}} includes orders, suborders, great groups, subgroups, {{families and}} series, with each series representing a unique kind of soil. In the United States, over 19,000 soil series have been identified. [...] The percentages of land area (in the US and associated territories, etc.) occupied by soils {{of the twelve}} orders have been estimated as:Alfisols and Inceptisols occur widely in the US, but the circumstances of their occurrence {{would be difficult to}} characterize briefly. The Alfisols have a subsurface ("B") horizon characterized by phyllosilicate clay accumulation (suggesting <b>illuviation</b> of such clay from above). The Inceptisols have a weakly developed B horizon as a consequence of weathering and/or other processes.|$|E
50|$|A catena forms {{when the}} climate, {{including}} precipitation and evaporation, {{is the same}} for the whole slope, and when sufficient time has passed for equilibrium to be reached between the processes that bring materials in to a facet and the processes that take materials away. The result is a predictable sequence of soil facets. A catena is thus an open system which has continuous input and output processes. On a steeper slope {{in the middle of a}} catena, erosion, such as by runoff, is faster, so facets are typically thinner and drier. Conversely, on a shallower slope at the top or bottom of a catena, soils are thicker and deeper. In addition, the top facets lose materials such as mineral salts when these are washed out by rain (eluviation), while the bottom facets gain materials when these are washed in (<b>illuviation).</b>|$|E
5000|$|B horizons form below an O, A, or E {{horizon and}} they have {{undergone}} sufficient changes during soil genesis, such that the properties of their original parent material are no longer discernible. The B horizon is {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "subsoil". In humid regions, B horizons are the layers of maximum accumulation of materials such as silicate clays, iron (Fe) and aluminium (Al) oxides, and organic material. These materials typically accumulate through a process termed <b>illuviation,</b> wherein the materials gradually wash in from the overlying horizons. Accordingly, this layer is also referred to as the [...] "illuviated" [...] horizon or the [...] "zone of accumulation". In addition, it is defined as having a distinctly different structure or consistency than the horizon(s) above and the horizon(s) below. The B horizon may also have stronger colors (higher chroma) than the A horizon. In arid and semiarid regions, calcium carbonate or calcium sulfate may accumulate in the B horizon.|$|E
50|$|Water is {{essential}} for all the major chemical weathering reactions. To be effective in soil formation, water must penetrate the regolith. The seasonal rainfall distribution, evaporative losses, site topography, and soil permeability interact to determine how effectively precipitation can influence soil formation. The greater the depth of water penetration, the greater the depth of weathering of the soil and its development. Surplus water percolating through the soil profile transports soluble and suspended materials from the upper layers (eluviation) to the lower layers (<b>illuviation),</b> including clay particles and dissolved organic matter. It may also carry away soluble materials in the surface drainage waters. Thus, percolating water stimulates weathering reactions and helps differentiate soil horizons. Likewise, a deficiency of water {{is a major factor}} in determining the characteristics of soils of dry regions. Soluble salts are not leached from these soils, and in some cases they build up to levels that curtail plant and microbial growth. Soil profiles in arid and semi-arid regions are also apt to accumulate carbonates and certain types of expansive clays (calcrete or caliche horizons). In tropical soils, when the soil has been deprived of vegetation (e.g. by deforestation) and thereby is submitted to intense evaporation, the upward capillary movement of water, which has dissolved iron and aluminum salts, is responsible for the formation of a superficial hard pan of laterite or bauxite, respectively, which is improper for cutivation, a known case of irreversible soil degradation (lateritization, bauxitization).|$|E
40|$|International audienceLessivage, {{also called}} argilluviation, {{consists}} of a substantial vertical transfer of particles less than 2 pm from a superficial departure horizon to a deeper horizon. This process is common in many soil types and responsible {{for the development of}} a textural differentiation in soil profiles in the subsurface. However, the mechanisms of lessivage are still poorly understood, and to our knowledge, lessivage has rarely been quantified. We propose here two original experiments of in vitro pedogenesis on soil columns to analyse the mechanisms acting in eluviation and <b>illuviation,</b> the two phases of lessivage, and to quantify these two phases in terms of particle export and fixation. We paid special attention to the experimental conditions, so that the conditions were favourable for lessivage and as close as possible to field conditions. The eluviation experiment showed that the release of particles was not the determining process for lessivage. We also showed that the smectite selectivity of eluviation was not continuous overtime. Both physical and chemical processes were identified as acting on both eluviation and <b>illuviation.</b> Concerning <b>illuviation,</b> experiments showed that from 25 to 90 % of the eluviated particles were retained in the deeper horizon. Although large, to our knowledge this range represents the first quantification of <b>illuviation.</b> (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{microscopic}} {{observations of}} the recent soil horizons were conducted in Okayama, Japan (moderate climate). The several soil horizons, including two surface (epipedon) and three subsurface horizons, were recognized in the forest, poorly vegetated hill, and riverside around the Okayama University. The umbric epipedon can be segregated from the organic-rich subsurface horizons by the scattered organic materials in thin sections. The ochrich epipedon shows the sandy matrix without any cements and the <b>illuviation</b> of clay minerals. The subsurface horizons identified {{in the study area}} are as follows: albic, argillic, and cambic horizons. Each subsurface horizon shows the specific structures in thin sections. The albic horizon is characterized by the absence of the <b>illuviation.</b> The argillic horizon definitely shows the clayey matrix and the <b>illuviation</b> of clay minerals. The primary structures may be retained in the cambic horizon. The microscopic examination of the Miocene paleosols from the Ukan-cho, Okayama, was attempted. By comparing the recent soils, the cambic horizon and spodic horizon, which is characterized by the concentration of sesquioxides, are identified in the paleosols. This attempt suggests that the microscopic {{observations of the}} recent soils is a useful guide to understanding the paleosol...|$|E

Profiles, one from the «fersialitic with calcic reserve. group located on a fluvioglacial terrace probably dating from the fini-Wurmian period, and two from the «fersialitic» without calcic reserve,, group on moraines which show signs of cryoturbation, and of an older pedogenesis, Riss-Wurm or perhaps Mindel-Riss, are presented. The first one shows a pH of between 7 and 7, 2, a saturation level greater than 65 % and a clay <b>illuviation</b> index of more than 1 / 1, 4. But from the iron <b>illuviation</b> index and the lower level of saturation -V- in the horizon B 3 (50, 3), it would perhaps be necessary to consider this soil as being a stage between the fersialitics with calcic reserve and those without it. From its colour it should perhaps be placed between the brown and the red fersialitics. The second profile corresponds to a reddish brown acid fersialitic soil (pH less than 5), only slighthly illuviated and devoid of calcic reserve. Judging by the pH {{it belongs to the}} IX/ 22 group (CPCS, 1967) but from the clay <b>illuviation</b> index which is greater than 1 / 1, 4 it resembles the IX/ 21 group. Thus, it seems like a IX/ 22 -IX/ 21 slightly illuviated fersialitic intergrade. The third profile described, a red acid fersialitic soil without calcic reserve, would also be taxonomically better classified as being between IX/ 21 and IX/ 22, due partly to the pH value and the dose of iron liberation in the horizon B, and partly to the exceedingly high values of the saturation complex as well as the clay <b>illuviation</b> index which is greater than 1 / 1, 4...|$|E
40|$|Seven {{transitional}} soils {{were selected}} to investigate the transition of Spodosols and Ultisols in the subalpine forests of Taiwan whose elevations range from 1900 m to 2700 m and have udic soil moisture regimes and mesic soil temperature regimes. The selected transitional forest soils include seven Ultic Spodosols based on USDA Soil Taxonomy, or seven Podzols based on the World Reference Base classification system. The soils with gentle landscape with < 10 % of slope are derived from sandstone and shale. The study area experiences a cool and humid climate with very high annual rainfall, ranging from 3000 to 4500 mm. The vegetation is coniferous vegetation dominated by Taiwan red cypress, Taiwan red pine, and peacock pine. The transition soils of Spodosols and Ultisols in Taiwan are specially characterized by loamy or clayey soil texture classes in the B horizon with clay contents ranging from 250 to 400 g/kg. High rainfall promotes the formation of these transition soils associated with strong <b>illuviation</b> of clay, organic carbon, free iron oxides, or organo-metallic complexes.

40|$|The pedogenic {{genesis of}} {{lamellae}} is commonly reported as involving clay <b>illuviation.</b> However, some pedogenic lamellae in tropical soils may be formed {{by a different}} process involving the degradation of a continuous Bt horizon and an intense loss of clay. in the present work, we investigated soils along a toposequence containing lamellae formed both by <b>illuviation</b> and Bt degradation {{to better understand the}} pedogenic processes and the environmental controls associated with the genesis of lamellae in tropical soils. Soils were described and sampled along a hillslope in the Sao Pedro region, São Paulo state, and submitted to physical (particle size), chemical (pH and exchangeable cations), and micromorphological analyses. in the Upper Segment of the studied hillslope, dominated by low gradients, the soil is deep, reddish, and contains a sequence of 12 to 20 lamellae/interlamellae. An examination of thin sections revealed abundant illuvial features formed by moderately to strongly oriented clay bridges between sandy particles in the lamellae, supporting an illuvial origin. in the Middle Segment of the hillslope, characterized by higher gradients, the soil is shallower and yellowish, presents some mottles, and contains a sequence of 2 lamellae/interlamellae. Field descriptions showed curved links between these lamellae and the underlying Bt as well as isolated spots similar to lamellae within interlamellae. the lamellae, Bt, curved links, and spots present similar micromorphological characteristics and only a few illuvial features, which suggest a genetic relationship between lamellae and the Bt horizon and minimize the importance of clay <b>illuviation.</b> the origin of these lamellae is related to the degradation of Bt and clay eluviation by subsurface lateral flows, developed mainly in the contact between Bt and the overlying, more permeable horizons. This process seems to be an important way of lamellae formation under tropical climate and should thus be incorporated into the term pedogenic lamellae, which is usually associated in the international literature with lamellae formed by clay <b>illuviation.</b> (C) 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|A {{detailed}} study of a loess-paleosol sequence in Oberlaab, Upper Austria, is presented with emphasis on macro- and micromorphological features, grain size distribution, rock magnetism properties, and weathering degree that allows correlation with other loess-paleosol sequences in neighboring areas, and interpretation of main pedogenic trends. The studied sequence comprises four paleosol complexes, which likely developed during four interglacial stages MIS 11, 9, 7 and 5 e, and a modern soil. The oldest paleosol complex (OL 5) represents three phases of soil formation, and distinct sedimentary events never reported in the area, with strong reductomorphic properties. The OL 4 profile also results from three phases of pedogenesis with increased reductomorphic features in the deepest zone (affected by cryoturbation events). OL 3 has abundant features related to gleyic/stagnic processes, but shows signs of clay <b>illuviation.</b> OL 2 (Eemian soil) correlates with the MIS 5 e. This paleosol shows higher degrees of clay <b>illuviation</b> and weathering, and fewer features related to reductomorphic processes. The modern soil is also polygenetic and constitutes a pedocomplex. Its lowermost part is formed by Würmian glacial deposits, where no well-developed soils are found; only reworked materials and pedosediments. Main pedogenic trends in the sequence are clearly differentiated. All of the paleosols were formed in humid environments, but differing in drainage conditions. The base, with OL 5 and OL 4 paleosols, was more affected by gleyic processes, while in the upper paleosols, especially OL 2, clay <b>illuviation</b> is dominant. We interpret such differences {{to be caused by}} the topographic position. The basal paleosols were more affected by fluvioglacial processes due to their position on top of the terrace. The upper paleosols received increased amounts of sediment through fluvial, colluvial and aeolian (loess) input...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Geomorphic {{surfaces}} {{that present}} soils derived from basic rocks under warm and humid climate are unique scenarios for studying tropical soils. This paper aimed to characterize and classify two pedons derived from basalt at the Atlantic Forest Zone, Pernambuco State, Northeastern coast of Brazil. Two representative pedons (P 1 and P 2) were selected on a hillslope at the Cabo de Santo Agostinho municipality. Field macromorphological descriptions {{were carried out}} and soil horizon were sampled for physical, chemical, mineralogical and micromorphological characterization. The soils were classified, according to the Brazilian System of Soil Classification (and US Soil Taxonomy) as: “Latossolo Vermelho-Amarelo distroférrico argissólico ” (Typic Hapludox) (P 1) and “Nitossolo Vermelho distroférrico típico ” (Rhodic Paleudult) (P 2). Pedon 1 differs from Pedon 2 in some aspects. For instance, P 1 presents more yellowish colors, absence of clay <b>illuviation,</b> more friable consistence and the prismatic structure undergoes transformation to angular and subangular blocks. Pedon 2 presents ferri-argilans and leptocutans which indicate that vertical and lateral <b>illuviation</b> of clay is an active process in their formation.

40|$|A {{study on}} a Holocene soil chronosequence in S-Norway {{is used to}} test the {{capability}} of the model SoilGen to model the development of soils with clay <b>illuviation.</b> SoilGen models soil formation {{as a function of the}} soil forming factors. Thus, the latter had to be reconstructed for the time span of soil development. The factors ‘relief’ and ‘parent material’ were obtained by field and laboratory analyses, the factor ‘time’ was derived from existing sea level curves, and the factors climate and organisms were obtained from literature and from a recent palaeo-environmental study. The chronosequence has been established on loamy marine sediments, and shows Albeluvisol development with time. Clay <b>illuviation</b> starts within 1650 years. The characteristic albeluvic tongues start to form after 4600 to 6200 years. They develop preferably along cracks. Albeluvic material falls into the cracks, leading to the development of albeluvic tongues, which become deeper and wider with time.

40|$|Among other driving forces, {{climate change}} {{may lead to}} {{significant}} modifications of soil properties through variations of the intensity and dynamics {{of a number of}} soil processes including the especially sensitive and ubiquitous processes of bioturbation and <b>illuviation.</b> Progress toward the quantification of these processes needs to be made as a first step in order to ascertain or predict the impact of climate change. In this study, we develop, and validate through an exhaustive accuracy assessment, a digital 2 D image analysis method adapted to large soil thin sections, leading to the quantification, characterization and classification of pores and illuvial clay features considered diagnostic of bioturbation and <b>illuviation,</b> respectively. The need to consider large soil thin sections (14 x 6 cm) stems from observations that areas from 684 mm 2 to more than 5 000 mm 2 are needed to obtain representative measurements of fragments of illuvial clay (papules) and porosity associated with earthworms respectively. Whereas the soil heterogeneity in thin sections of such a large size prohibits the use of classical global and colorimetric image analysis procedures, we succeeded to quantify and characterize the porosity and illuvial clay features with accuracies as high as 96 % for porosity and 92 % for illuvial clay by carefully considering different levels of soil organization from aggregates to individual illuvial clay features. Quantification of the size and the shape of pores and of illuvial clay features makes it possible to develop morphological classifications distinguishing pores of biological origin (earthworms or roots) from others, or clay coatings and infillings from papules. All these data are particularly useful to better characterize underlying soil processes. Results suggest that the proposed methodology provides an accurate and representative quantification of biological porosity and illuvial clay features in large thin sections. We argue that the use of this approach could be extended to study and quantify bioturbation and <b>illuviation</b> intensities at the profile scale...|$|E
40|$|The {{upper reaches}} of the Segre river, flowing through the Pyrenees, offers a variety of geomorphic {{surfaces}} that allow us to study soil chronosequences. The objective of this work is to widen the knowledge about the main characteristics and formation processes of some benchmark soils developed on fluvio-glacial, alluvial-fan and terrace materials of Pleistocene and Holocene age related to the Segre river, either siliceous or carbonatic. This knowledge will allow us to identify soil forming processes, commonly found in Mediterranean environments such as carbonate redistribution, clay formation and mobilization and rubefaction, all as functions of parent material and age. Five profiles, ranging from the Lower Pleistocene to the Holocene were classified according to Soil Taxonomy /WRB. The Montferrer profile (Calcic Palexeralf /Calcic Cutanic Luvisol (Chromic) is a deep, partly decarbonated soil, with calcium carbonate accumulation in depth covering glacial features. The Torre del Remei profile (Typic Paleustalf /Cutanic Luvisol) developed on silicic moraines and shows an extreme clay formation and <b>illuviation.</b> The Alp (Typic Haplustalf /Cutanic Luvisol) and Tartera (Petric Calciustept /Petric Calcisol) soils are developed on alluvial fans with calcium carbonate sources. The former is partly decarbonated, whilst the latter is rubefacted on top and shows speleothem-like carbonate pendants with superposition of clay <b>illuviation.</b> The youngest profile, Abellerols, (Typic Calciustept /Typic Calcisol) shows only a partial decarbonation and calcite accumulation at depth. The results show that soil development is determined by the age of the surface and the source of calcite, either in the parent rock or brought by subsurface flow: clay <b>illuviation</b> is extreme in absence of it. Special morphologies of carbonate pendants are indicators of environmental conditions. The coexistence of clay coatings and secondary calcite can be explained by recarbonatation or by spatial differentiation of soil environments in the profile. One of the implications of this research is the inconsistence of using soil development indices based on morphological indicators when soils are formed on different parent materials and are subjected to different geomorphic dynamics...|$|E

Both profiles showed a set of characteristics indicative for weathering of primary minerals, clay transformation <b>illuviation</b> and surface redoximorphic (stagnic) processes. Paleosols demonstrate more advanced development than the Holocene analogues manifested however in different pedogenetic characteristics. The Eemian Luvisol in Upper Austria is characterized by stronger clay <b>illuviation</b> manifested in higher clay content and abundance of illuvial clay pedofeatures in the Bt horizon. Mikulino Albeluvisol in Central Russia is more strongly affected by eluvial and stagnic processes evidenced by deeper and more intensive accumulation of bleached silty material and clay depletion. We suppose that the properties of parent material are responsible for these differences. Russian Albeluvisol is formed on the Dnepr loess poor in weatherable minerals and having limited capacity for buffering acidity and clay formation. The higher development status of the Last Interglacial paleosols compared to the Holocene soils having however same type pedogenesis implies longer soil formation period, that agree with some of the paleobotanical proxies and could include besides MIS 5 e part of MIS 5 d; the warmer and moister paleoclimate during MIS 5 e could also account for more advanced paleosol development Several phases of clay <b>illuviation</b> interrupted by frost structuring and deformation are detected in the Eemian Bt horizon in Upper Austria.

40|$|Important pedogenic {{processes}} of soils formed on dolomitic limestones {{are affected by}} the degree of in-situ weathering of the underlying bedrock. Decalcification and silicate clay <b>illuviation</b> of Haplustalfs and Calciustolls of the Colorado Plateau in northwestern Arizona results from the establishment of effective porosity in the parent rock. The underlying carbonate strata, the Kaibab Formation, are a complex limestone-dolomite-chert marine sediment of Permian age. Diagenetic processes have modified the initial porosity present at the time the sediment was deposited. Pleistocene meteoric waters, percolating downward, have resulted in the solutioning and partial removal of the calcium carbonate and the establishment of a porous dolomitic framework. Under these conditions, soils forming in residuum are able to decalcify and to form argillic horizons. However, in more resistant limestones, compaction during burial has resulted in a nonporous micrite which retards calcite removal by meteoric waters. Under these conditions, soil profiles maintain a high CaCO₃ content and silicate clay <b>illuviation</b> does not occur. Micaceous clay minerals of residual origin are converted to montmorillonite in the Alfisols. A probable sequence of events for this transformation to occur is: (1) the removal of calcite from the dolomitic limestone bedrock and the formation of a dolomitic framework, (2) the slow dissolution of dolomite and release of Mg⁺⁺ into solution, (3) the incorporation of Mg⁺⁺ into the octahedral layer of the mica and the release of K⁺ from the mica interlayer position, and (4) the <b>illuviation</b> of montmorillonite to form the argillic horizon. Eolian dust is also important to soil genesis on the Colorado Plateau. In particular, quartz in the coarse silt fraction (31 - 44 um) and quartz and biotite in the very fine and fine silt fractions (2. 0 - 16 um). Two alluvial soils of Pleistocene age shows important morphological differences. Thick carbonate accumulations of ground water origin are present in the older soil.

In the Iranian soil layer we will find: decayed parent materials, decaying plant material, decaying animal matter (manure) along with vegetation. Results {{of the present study}} show us that methods stimulating natural fertility in Iran includes composting-adds humus layer, drip irrigation-balances <b>illuviation</b> and eluviation in arid regions, crop rotation/ intercropping-reflects natural diversity and limits gleization, add lime-reduces gleization, non-cultivation techniques-reduces hard pan (calcification) caused by compaction and reduce pesticide use-keeps decomposers alive in humus layer...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{results of}} a multidisciplinary and multi-analytical study of Holocene archaeological soils around Cecita Lake (Sila massif, Calabria, southern Italy), which represents a typical upland Mediterranean environment. It is focused on assessment of climatic and environmental changes that took place since late Neolithic to Roman times, trying to discriminate natural from anthropogenic signals. Based on an integration of archaeological, geomorphological, stratigraphic, pedological, volcanological and soil charcoal (pedoanthracological) data, the following paleoclimatic/environmental reconstruction is proposed: a warm and humid, seasonally contrasted climate, with an overall geomorphological stability suited for soil development, characterized the late prehistoric environment (Holocene climatic optimum), dominated by a widespread oak forest. The main pedogenetic processes consisted in organic matter accumulation, clay <b>illuviation,</b> phyllosilicate and short-range order mineral neogenesis from weathering of granite and volcanic ash, sourced from late Pleistocene-Holocene eruptions of the Aeolian Islands. One or more mid-Holocene episodes of climate deterioration towards drier conditions (indicated by a decrease of clay translocation processes and possible irreversible dehydration of poorly-crystalline aluminosilicates into phyllosilicate clay minerals) promoted intense land degradation. This was in turn enhanced by increasing human activities for settlement and resource exploitation (among which deforestation and ploughing for agriculture), {{which led to a}} shift of the vegetation cover towards a dominant pine forest between 3 kaBP and the Roman epoch. Humid and possibly cooler climatic conditions during the late Holocene are indicated by the decrease of clay <b>illuviation,</b> coupled with short-range order components prevailing over phyllosilicate clays during Roman soil formation...|$|E
40|$|Summary In {{order to}} {{understand}} better the mechanisms of structural crust formation on coarse-textured soils, mixtures of 92. 5 % sand and 7. 5 % Ca 2 +-kaolinite are exposed to simulated rainfall in experiments- involving a range of sand particle sizes, drop diameters and drop kinetic energies. For each combination of these variables, clay <b>illuviation</b> is measured and the changes in surface structure are observed on thin sections. The intensity of clay <b>illuviation</b> is inversely proportional to sand particle size and is shown {{to be determined by}} both rainfall and drop kinetic energy. A washed-out layer forms at the surface of all samples exposed to drop impact. The lower boundary of this layer is generally marked by a relative concentration of clay micro-aggregates {{in the form of a}} band. These micro-aggregates are probably fragments derived from grain coatings initially present in the washed-out layer. They accumulate at a depth that increases, on average, with drop kinetic energy and with the particle size of the sand fraction. Based on similarities with natural crusts, it is proposed that clay-band formation in structural crusts formed on coarse-textured soils may be initiated by the displacement of micro-aggregates or other small particles from the washed-out layer, followed by their accumulation due to mechanical straining. The experiments also point to the potential importance of the particle size of the sand fraction on the morphology of structural crusts...|$|E
