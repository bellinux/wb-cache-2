2500|$|A <b>distributed</b> <b>Bragg</b> <b>reflector</b> laser (DBR) {{is a type}} {{of single}} {{frequency}} laser diode. [...] It is characterized by an optical cavity consisting of an electrically or optically pumped gain region between two mirrors to provide feedback. [...] One of the mirrors is a broadband reflector and the other mirror is wavelength selective so that gain is favored on a single longitudinal mode, resulting in lasing at a single resonant frequency. The broadband mirror is usually coated with a low reflectivity coating to allow emission. [...] The wavelength selective mirror is a periodically structured diffraction grating with high reflectivity. The diffraction grating is within a non-pumped, or passive region of the cavity [...] [...] A DBR laser is a monolithic single chip device with the grating etched into the semiconductor. [...] DBR lasers can be edge emitting lasers or VCSELs. [...] Alternative hybrid architectures that share the same topology include extended cavity diode lasers and volume Bragg grating lasers, but these are not properly called DBR lasers.|$|E

Surface Plasmon Polaritons (SPPs) are quantized charge density oscillations that occur at the interface between metal and dielectric materials when photons couple to the free electron gas of the metal. The extraordinary properties of SPPs can be utilized for sub-diffraction limit wave guiding and localized field enhancement.
