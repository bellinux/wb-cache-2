5|$|After the Crimson Tide defense <b>forced</b> <b>a</b> State punt to {{open the}} third quarter, Kendrick Market <b>forced</b> <b>a</b> T. J.

The Bulldogs scored on their drive that ensued after Charles Siddoway recovered a Tyler Russell fumble in the endzone that made the score 10–7. Alabama responded on their next possession with an 11-yard McCarron touchdown pass to Kevin Norwood that extended their lead to 17–7. After the State possession that followed, HaHa Clinton-Dix intercepted a Tyler Russell pass. Foster then made the score 20–7 with his 35-yard field goal {{early in the fourth}} quarter. The Crimson Tide then had a difficult time closing the game as turnovers on consecutive possessions on a McCarron interception and a Kenyan Drake fumble. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Bulldogs to 76–18–3 (78–17–3 without NCAA vacations and forfeits).|$|E

Subsequently, various authors have consider the average degree required to <b>force</b> <b>an</b> arbitrary graph $H$ as a minor. Here, we strengthen (under certain conditions) a recent result by Reed and Wood, giving better bounds on the average degree required to <b>force</b> <b>an</b> $H$-minor when $H$ is a sparse graph with many high degree vertices. This solves an open problem of Reed and Wood, and also generalises (to within a constant factor) known results when $H$ is an unbalanced complete bipartite graph...|$|R

5|$|Accommodations {{were even}} more cramped and poorly {{ventilated}} than earlier ships because the ammunition hoists passed through the crew spaces, a problem for ships intended for long-endurance sorties into the North Atlantic. The lack of room in the hull <b>forced</b> <b>a</b> number of workshops and offices into the superstructure which added more weight high in the ship. There were three deckhouses abaft the break in the forecastle with intervals between them to permit the beam torpedo tubes to rotate, but these were no larger than in earlier ships which meant that space was at a premium.|$|E
5|$|According to the National Trust, {{the grass}} is trimmed {{regularly}} and the giant is fully re-chalked every 25 years.

Two plays later, Alabama led 38–0 after T. J. Yeldon scored on a one-yard run. Arkansas responded with their longest drive of the game; however, it ended when Deion Belue <b>forced</b> <b>a</b> Knile Davis fumble that was recovered by Nick Perry at the Alabama 20-yard line. With {{the majority of the}} offensive starters pulled from the game, the Crimson Tide reserves led Alabama on a 15-play, 80-yard drive that ended with a 12-yard Kenyan Drake touchdown run early in the fourth quarter. The final touchdown of the game was set up late in the game after Knile Davis lost his second fumble of the game on a Jeoffrey Pagan tackle that was recovered by Denzel Devall.
