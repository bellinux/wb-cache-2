40|$|Starting {{induction}} motors on isolated or weak {{systems is}} a highly dynamic process that can cause motor and load damage as well as electrical network fluctuations. Mechanical damage {{is associated with the}} high starting current drawn by a ramping induction motor. In order to compensate the load increase, the voltage of the electrical system decreases. Different starting methods {{can be applied to the}} electrical system to reduce these and other starting method issues. The purpose of this thesis is to build accurate and usable simulation models that can aid the designer in making the choice of an appropriate motor starting method. The specific case addressed is the situation where a <b>diesel-generator</b> <b>set</b> is used as the electrical supplied source to the induction motor. The most commonly used starting methods equivalent models are simulated and compared to each other. The main contributions of this thesis is that motor dynamic impedance i...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper a new method is {{presented}} {{for the evaluation of}} torsional stressing of <b>diesel-generator</b> <b>sets</b> consisting of components with uncertain torsional characteristics. A frequency scanning technique is implemented for eigenvalue analysis of the elastic system. Due to the uncertainty of the values of stiffness and damping coefficients, a sensitivity analysis method is also presented, suitable for the evaluation of the range of the mechanical stresses. Special consideration is given to the correct simulation of the coupling to the electric network, including the influence of generator regulators and possible network interactions. An exact formula is extracted for the synchronizing and damping torque coefficients. The method presented was checked in a Diesel Power Station of the autonomous electric system of a Greek island. © 1996 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|Diesel Electric Propulsion (DEP), {{in which}} the ship {{propeller}} is driven by electric motors and diesel-generator sets that provide the energy necessary to cover the demand in mechanical and electrical loads of a ship, is gaining ground in marine applications. This paper deals with alternative ways of modelling of DEP electrical and mechanical components in MATLAB/Simulink® and simulations that are carried out for an offshore supply vessel. Firstly, a comprehensive model for the <b>diesel-generator</b> <b>set</b> of the DEP, which includes the diesel engines and synchronous generators, is developed. Different types of short-circuits are imposed at the terminals of the generator {{in order to assess}} the transient response of the diesel engine-generator set, and to identify if any dangerous operations conditions arise. Furthermore, the development of a detailed model for the overall DEP that includes variable speed drives and propulsion motors has been implemented.

50|$|Type A. A type A test {{is a test}} of a {{principal}} unit. This is the preferred test. Principal units are items which are directly supported by the ship structure or by a foundation which is directly attached to the ship structure, and items mounted in piping systems, ducting systems, and similar systems which are supported by ship structure. The shock response of {{a principal}} unit is primarily {{a function of the}} rigidity and mass of the item and the shipboard mounting structure, the shipboard mounting location, and the configuration of the item. Such items typically include <b>diesel-generator</b> <b>sets,</b> air conditioning plants, switchboards, radio transmitters, steam generators, missile launchers, and valves (if installed in piping which is supported by ship structure).|$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} {{that the main}} sources of noise and vibration in canopied Diesel generators are the Diesel engine, the fan and the alternator. This paper focuses on the flanking transmission of noise and vibration from the sources to the canopy and baseframe. The canopy is basically a combination of large rectangular steel plates which behave as noise radiating panels converting vibration into noise which then radiates into the environment. The objective of the research is to identify the main transmission paths and correlate noise and vibration levels. For this purpose a number of measurement positions have been located on the engine, fan, alternator, AVMs, baseframe, canopy and other relevant parts in order to observe levels of noise and vibration. Measurements of the attenuation or amplification of vibration and hence noise radiation has enabled critical areas {{to be identified as}} well as overall noise levels in the vicinity of <b>diesel-generator</b> <b>sets...</b>|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{gives an}} {{overview}} of research activities carried out at NTNU AMOS in relation to hybrid marine power plants enabling safer, smarter and greener ships. Recently electrical power plants with a <b>set</b> of <b>diesel-generator</b> <b>sets</b> segregated on several power buses have become the preferred solution for ships with a variation in operational profile and corresponding power demands. Examples of such ships are dynamically positioned (DP) vessels with electric power plants {{in the range of}} 10 - 80 MW used in the offshore oil and gas industry for various service, drilling, intervention and production operations, see Figure 1. The operations are characterised as safety-critical and will take place all-year with large variations in the environmental loads acting on the ship due to wind, waves, ocean currents, and recently more operations in sea-ice. Electrical power plants have also become the preferred solution for cruise ships, ferries, navy ships, LNG tankers, and icebreakers. The electric energy production may be powered by a hybrid marine power plant constituting of diesel engines, gas engines, and integrated with energy storage devices (ESD) such as banks of batteries. By proper design and control systems significant fuel savings can be achieved making the ships greener and safer...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – The {{last decade}} {{has seen a}} {{large-scale}} growth in the requirement of uninterrupted power supply for industries, residential and commercial complexes and educational institutions. At many of these locations, standbypower is provided by <b>diesel-generator</b> (DG) <b>sets.</b> Proper control and monitoring of these DG sets is an imperative, since any interruption in the supply caused due to improper functioning of the standby-unit, {{would lead to a}} loss of productivity. In this paper, the software and hardware details of a prototype PC based monitoring unit for a DG set is discussed. This unit was developed and implemented at the power station of the Amrita School of Engineering, Coimbatore. The system has three main functionalities: parameter monitoring, data logging and raising alarm when the DG set malfunctions. I...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} reactive-power control of an {{isolated}} wind–diesel {{hybrid power system}} is presented. The system generates electrical power from wind by an induction generator (IG) and a synchronous generator (SG) is present for a <b>diesel-generator</b> (DG) <b>set.</b> The mathematical model of the reactive-power balance is presented. In an isolated system IG consumes reactive power which is supplied by the static var compensator (SVC). It also provides reactive power support for load variations. In the type III SVC used here, the proportional integral (PI) controller gains are optimized using Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm. Three objective functions namely Integral Time Absolute Error (ITAE), Integral Square Error (ISE) and Integral Time Square Error (ITSE) are considered and their performance is compared in a hybrid system and with earlier work...|$|R

The main problem in the implementa-tion of power supply for ships from land is connected with matching parameters of voltage in onshore network with marine network. Currently, the recommended solution is to supply ships from the onshore electricity network with the use of power electronic converters.
