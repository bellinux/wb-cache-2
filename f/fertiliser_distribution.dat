Alternative distribution patterns can be measured with compact devices that intercept the particle flow immediately after leaving the spinning disc. An experimental facility was built which allowed the measurement of the tangential, {{as well as the}} cylindrical distribution of the particle flow at the disc edge. A number of experiments were carried out, using one type of centrifugal spreader with a conical disc. The influences of vane length, mass flow rate, particle size and fertiliser type on both the tangential and the cylindrical distribution patterns have been investigated. The results show that flows of particles with a larger mean diameter achieve a higher velocity on the disc, causing the distribution patterns to shift to lower angular positions. Furthermore, it is concluded that a smaller average particle size leads to a higher mass discharge flow rate from the hopper. In addition, a shift of the cylindrical distribution to a lower vertical position is observed when the mass flow rate increases. (C) 2003 Silsoe Research Institute.

A recent technique was proposed by United Utilities plc {{for the production}} of organomineral fertilisers (OMF) from biosolids granules which adds additional nitrogen to the biosolids’ nutrients to form a balanced NPK fertiliser. The aim of this research was to determine the effects in cereal and grass crops of using organomineral fertilisers (OMF) made from nutrients-enriched biosolids granules and to contribute towards the understanding of nutrient management and dynamics in agricultural systems. The research included soil incubation, glasshouse, lysimeters and field studies which used winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). A theoretical model was developed for <b>fertiliser</b> particle <b>distribution</b> studies which required the determination of key physical properties of the products.

These were suggested for use in grassland as well as arable cropping. The particle trajectory model showed that the particle size range for OMF 10 and OMF 15 should be between 1. 10 and 5. 50 mm and between 1. 05 and 5. 30 mm in diameter respectively. Cont/d.

40|$|Agricultural {{activities}} in the Netherlands cause high nitrogen and phosphorous fluxes from soil to ground- and surface water. A model chain (STONE) has been developed to study and predict {{the magnitude of the}} resulting ground- and surface water pollution under different environmental conditions. STONE has three main components, namely: 1) the <b>fertiliser</b> <b>distribution</b> model CLEAN; 2) the atmospheric transport and deposition model OPS; and 3) the soil and soil-water quality model ANIMO. The goal {{of this study was to}} assess the accuracy of the STONE model output by comparing model predictions with independent observations, while accounting for spatial variation and differences in spatial support. The specific STONE output considered was mineral phosphorous concentration in the top soil. Predictions from STONE are made at the block support and, specifically, for 500 × 500 m grid cells, whereas the observations are on a point support. Therefore, aggregation of the point observations or disaggregation of the STONE model predictions is needed in order to test the accuracy of the STONE model. This study used the aggregation route. Specifically, ordinary and regression block kriging were used to aggregate the point observations to the block support. Overall, there was a good correspondence between the kriged observations and the STONE predictions, with no evidence of bias in the model predictions. However, there were meaningful differences locally, which was partly attributed to the smoothing of the kriging interpolator. Closer inspection revealed that not all of the differences could be attributed to measurement errors in the phosphorous observations and interpolation errors in the kriged phosphorous maps. Thus, it was demonstrated that the STONE output suffers from input and/or model errors. However, quantification of these errors was restricted by the fairly large interpolation uncertainty of the kriged phosphorous observations. Nevertheless, the spatial pattern of error in the STONE predictions could be partly attributed to combinations of landuse and soil type...|$|E
40|$|Future {{agricultural}} engineering for organic farming embraces three essential areas: support of animal welfare, use of renewable energy, and strengthening sustainable crop production. European organic farmers increasingly use {{renewable energy sources}} like wind and biogas. Civil engineers and architects are planning new buildings according to national and international organic animal husbandry regulations. In respect of organic crop production, modern gantry technology offers ideal support of organic farming objectives especially in respect of development and improvement of soil structure. A review of scientific publications concerning gantry research within {{the past ten years}} in respect of organic farming principles leads to the following results: 1. Present stage of gantry research results show, that gantry technology saves work, increases profitability, saves energy, improves and preserves soil structure, extends working time periods and improves timeliness of critical operations, offers weather and day light independent field work, precise <b>fertiliser</b> <b>distribution</b> and irrigation, high precision intra-row weed control, field mapping for various objectives, automation of repeating work steps, automated operations by computer vision, and grants better working conditions; 2. Gantry technology supports additionally organic crop production offering plot mapping for habitat specific operations, perennial vegetation covering because of no till, mixed cropping/alley cropping systems using allelopathic effects for weed and pest resistance, well timed and precise distribution of compost and preparates, and mulch based cultivation and fertilisation methods; 3. Gantry technology renders excellent opportunity for transdisciplinary research and co-operation between life scientists and engineers. Measuring and observation of biodiversity indicators, energy balance, soil tilth, nutrient balance, quality of work, and quality of products requires scientists from different disciplines. Dynamic observation methods using computer vision and image processing methods for documentation of plant appearance during all stages of development may support human observation. Gantry technology offers continuous mapping of plot specific soil and flora data. The habitat specific information can be used to plan a crop rotation including mixed cropping or strip cultivation solutions, green mulch fertilisation, and allelopathic effects best suited for a given plot or even for a specific location of a given plot. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceExcessive {{fertiliser}} use {{has been}} a main contributor to the increasing environmental imbalance observed in the past 20 years. Better accuracy in spreading would limit excess fertiliser loss into the environment. Increased accuracy begins by understanding the fertiliser spreading process from the vane to the soil. Our work concentrates {{on the use of}} centrifugal spreaders, as these are most commonly used in Europe. Progress in imaging devices and image processing has resulted in the availability of new technologies to use when describing the behaviour of fertiliser granules during ejection from centrifugal spreaders. Fertiliser deposition on the soil can be predicted using a ballistic flight model, but this requires determination of the velocities and the directions of the granules when they leave the spinning disc. This paper presents improvements to the high speed imaging system that we had previously developed, i. e. enhancements to the illumination and the image processing. The illumination of the previous system, which used many separate flashes, did not give consistent illumination. We have improved it by using a stroboscope with power-LEDs, located at 1 m height around the digital camera and controlled by a Field-programmable gate array (FPGA) card. The image processing has been improved by development of a multi-phase method based on a cross-correlation algorithm. We have compared the cross-correlation method to the Markov Random Fields (MRF) method previously implemented. These tests, based on multi-exposure images, revealed that cross-correlation method gives more accurate results than the MRF technique, with guaranteed sub-pixel accuracy. Knowing that an error of one pixel can lead to a prediction error between 200 and 500 mm on the ground, the latter method gives an accuracy range between 0. 1 and 0. 4 pixels, whereas the MRFs technique is limited to 3 and 9 pixels for the vertical and horizontal components of the velocities, respectively. The sub-pixel accuracy of the new method was proven by applying it on simulated images with known displacements between the grains. By using a realistic spreading model, the simulated images are similar to those obtained with a high speed imaging system. This sub-pixel accuracy now makes it possible to decrease the resolution of the camera to that of a classical high-speed camera. These improvements have created an affordable and durable system appropriate for installation on a spreader. Farmers could use this system to both calibrate the spreader and verify the <b>fertiliser</b> <b>distribution</b> on the ground...|$|E

Compression tests showed that OMF particles undergo deformation followed by multiple failures without disintegration of the granules when vertical load was applied. This behaviour was attributed to the moisture content (� 15 % w w- 1) and the organic nature of the material. Static particle strength was between 1. 14 and 6. 31 Nmm- 2 depending on the particle diameter.

40|$|Theoretically, in {{the absence}} of friction, when a {{particle}} is sliding along a straight radial vane, mounted on a flat disc which is spinning at a constant rotational velocity, its radial and tangential velocity are equal at any point along the vane.

These factors were Jumped together and termed the 'friction coefficient'. The tangential particle velocity at the discharge point was assumed constant, since the particle was assumed in direct contact with the vane until emanation. The radial particle velocity was measured at a distance of 0. 4 m from the disc edge with an optical sensor developed in earlier research.

In the split-root system, plants of all three species grown under heterogeneous soil P conditions absorbed more P and produced greater root and shoot biomass than those under homogeneous P supply. Root plasticity differed between species under heterogeneous soil P supply: canola and wheat allocated relatively more root biomass and root length to the high P zone than narrow-leaf lupin. In the column experiment, {{there was no difference}} in the amount of P accumulated in shoots of any crops grown in the deep vs shallow P fertiliser treatments. Root proliferation occurred within the shallow and deep-P fertiliser bands in all three species; however, root distribution above or below the bands did not differ between deep or shallow P fertiliser treatments in any species. Whilst root plasticity responses to heterogeneous soil P supply differed among species, root architecture (fibrous vs taproot) did not confer any advantage or disadvantage to the acquisition of P from deep vs shallow P fertiliser bands.

40|$|This report {{reviews the}} 2009 / 10 {{implementation}} of the Farm Input Subsidy Programme 2009 / 10 {{in the context of}} experience from 2005 / 6 to 2008 / 9. The 2009 / 10 programme differed from previous years in restriction of fertiliser subsidies to maize production, reduced <b>fertiliser</b> <b>distribution</b> budgets which were also adhered to, large increases in maize (particularly hybrid) and legume seed distribution, considerable carry forward of fertiliser stocks from previous year purchases, and earlier sales of fertiliser. These changes all have important positive implications for the programme’s effectiveness and efficiency as a result of reduced displacement, improved targeting, reduced programme costs (which also benefited from lower fertiliser prices), improved returns to use of subsidised fertiliser on hybrid maize, and food security, diversification and soil fertility benefits from the increased legume seed sales. Increased maize and legume seed sales through private retailers should also stimulate input market development. The economic benefit cost ratio for the programme is estimated at 1. 12, a respectable result (despite the many difficulties with this analysis and its blindness to many longer term and intangible benefits) with considerable potential for further improvement. The macro-economic costs of the programme have also been substantially reduced as compared with the previous year and the year on year rises in costs halted. These are important achievements. There are two main areas where it is proposed that programme implementation could look for substantial improvements in the future: first in achieving greater transparency in beneficiary identification and coupon issues and second in allowing earlier sales of inputs. Greater transparency in beneficiary identification and coupon issues should build on achievements {{over the last four years}} (for example in improved targeting and use of open meetings) by (a) resolving inconsistencies both in changing MoAFS farm family numbers across regions and with NSO estimates, (b) improving effective communication about coupon allocation and distribution systems, (c) increasing the transparency and accountability of these processes with, for example, the involvement of different stakeholders representing farmers, and (d) sharing and implementing good practice in particular districts or areas more widely across the country. Earlier input sales are important for reducing the costs and risks faced by farmers in redeeming coupons, promoting higher yield responses from earlier planting and fertiliser application, reducing pressures and costs in fertiliser deliveries to markets, and giving farmers more voice and choice when redeeming coupons. This requires that the 2009 / 10 improvements in fertiliser deliveries and in seed contracting are sustained and accompanied by earlier finalising of coupon allocations and printing than in 2009 / 10 – as has already been recognised by strenuous attempts to achieve earlier commencement of sales in 2010...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} about the factors {{influencing}} the purchases of fertiliser and prescription farming in general and Pivot fertilisers and the Pivot Prescription Farming in particular. The purchase of Pivot fertilisers {{in this study is}} defined to be a decision about Pivot as the main fertiliser company. Meanwhile, the purchase of Pivot Prescription Farming is defined as whether or not farmers purchase the Pivot Prescription Farming for the on going activities of their farms. Prescription farming, in this study, refers to services associated with farm inputs such as soil testing and plant analysis. Farmers' decision-making process on the farm inputs, including the choice within a product class, might be dominantly influenced by the problem-solving process. However, the human factors in the farmers' decision is also important. Thus, the farmer's decision-making process is likely to be based on a combination of cognitive and emotional models. In the context of farm income, farmers normally face three stages on the problem of their income allocation. First, allocation to production, consumption and savings. Second, allocation to the categories of generic products in farm activities such as tractors, compound feed and fertilisers. Third, allocation within a product class such as a particular product type or brand. Since the purchase of fertiliser and prescription farming might be categorised as an out-stock situation, the buying process for these inputs only involves stage three. Past research has indicated that the purchase of fertilisers from a particular firm might be affected by quality, price, service, availability of <b>fertiliser,</b> <b>distribution</b> coverage and a specific relationship with the firm. Past studies on the use of soil testing and plant analysis, which are some elements of prescription farming, have shown that price, turnaround time, reliability of results, service and follow up of the service have influenced the use of these services. Additionally, knowledge about available providers, which reflects the amount of information possessed, may influence the purchase. The quantitative analyses in this study use existing data from Pivot Ltd. The method used in this study is logistic regression. The decision on the purchase of Pivot Prescription Farming is involved in the model for the decision on Pivot as the main fertiliser company, and vice versa. For this particular sample, the results revealed that no variable was found to be significant in explaining the decision about Pivot as the main fertiliser company. Only the purchase of Pivot Prescription Fanning and some dummy variables for types of farm and states were significant. The result may indicate that subjective norm appears in the outcome. For the decision about the purchase of the Pivot Prescription Farming, knowledge about service provider, follow up, turnaround time and the decision on Pivot as the main fertiliser company significantly affected the purchase. Those results indicated that farmers who chose Pivot as their main fertiliser company were more likely to purchase the Pivot Prescription Farming, and vice versa. The results also revealed {{that there is a need}} to do further research to incorporate with the important issues such as brand loyalty, consumer attitude formation, and the multipersonal influence in farm enterprise, in a better survey with more exhaustive data collection methods.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the possibility of reducing energy input in giant reed (Arundo donax L.) as a perennial biomass crop, a field experiment was carried out from 1996 to 2001 in central Italy. Crop yield response to fertilisation (200 – 80 – 200 kg ha− 1 N–P–K), harvest time (autumn and winter) and plant density (20, 000 and 40, 000 plants per ha) was evaluated. The energy balance was assessed considering the energy costs of production inputs and the energy output obtained by {{the transformation of the}} final product. The crop yield increased by + 50 % from the establishment period to the 2 nd year of growth when it achieved the highest dry matter yield. The mature crop displayed on average annual production rates of 3 kg dry matter m− 2, with maximum values obtained in fertilised plot and during winter harvest time. Fertilisation mainly enhanced dry matter yield in the initial period (+ 0. 7 kg dry matter m− 2 as years 1 – 6 mean value). The biomass water content was affected by harvest time, decreasing by about 10 % from autumn to winter. With regard to plant density, higher dry matter yields were achieved with 20, 000 plants per ha (+ 0. 3 kg dry matter m− 2 as years 1 – 6 mean value). The total energy input decreased from fertilised (18 GJ ha− 1) to not fertilised crops (4 GJ ha− 1). The higher energetic input was represented by fertilisation which involved 14 GJ ha− 1 (<b>fertilisers</b> plus their <b>distribution)</b> of total energy costs. This value represents 78 % of total energy inputs for fertilised crops. Giant reed biomass calorific mean value (i. e. the calorific value obtained from combustion of biomass sample in an adiabatic system) was about 17 MJ kg− 1 dry matter and it was not affected by fertilisation, or by plant density or harvest time. Fertilisation enhanced crop biomass yield from 23 to 27 dry tonnes per hectare (years 1 – 6 mean value). This 15 % increase was possible with an energy consumption of 70 % of the overall energy cost. Maximum energy yield output was 496 GJ ha− 1, obtained with 20, 000 plants per hectare and fertilisation. From the establishment period to 2 nd– 6 th year of growth the energy production efficiency (as ratio between energy output and energy input per ha) and the net energy yield (as difference between energy output and energy input per ha) increased due to the low crop dry biomass yield and the high energy costs for crop planting. The energy production efficiency and net energy yield were also affected by fertilisation and plant density. In the mature crop the energy efficiency was highest without fertilisation both with 20, 000 (131 GJ ha− 1) and 40, 000 plants per ha (119 GJ ha− 1) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the pursuit}} for a {{sustainable}} agricultural production respecting ecological, {{social and economic}} values, modern farmers {{are well aware of}} the importance of a correct and precise fertiliser application. Indeed, non-uniform spread patterns can cause extra pressure on the environment and might result in economic losses for the farmer. Because of the higher price of pneumatic fertiliser spreaders and the limited working width of pendulum spreaders, centrifugal spreaders are most commonly used in Europe. Although the centrifugal spreading mechanism is simple, the process is hard to control and can lead to a deviation between the desired and the actual <b>fertiliser</b> <b>distribution</b> in the field. This non-uniform application can have several causes: the behavior of the operator, the properties of the fertiliser, the settings of the machinery and external conditions like the unevenness of the field or the wind. Even though farmers realize the importance of a precise fertilising, most of them cannot adapt the settings of the spreader to improve the pattern uniformity because they do not have the proper tools to determine and evaluate the spread pattern at farm level. Therefore, the general objective of this dissertation is to explore and develop a fast and accurate technique for measuring the spread pattern of conventional centrifugal spreaders. This method aims to be low cost and applicable on farm level. Also, it has to be mobile to the extent that the device can be built up on site to test several machines. The device should enable the adjustment of the spreader in such a way that a uniform spread pattern is obtained. Three existing approaches for evaluating the spread pattern are available. For the collector tray method, the grains are collected in trays and weighted in spread halls or on the field. The tests are time and fertiliser consuming. By using a full modeling approach, like the Discrete Element Method (DEM), this can be avoided. DEM takes all possible interactions between the grains into account and performs well in predicting spread pattern. The hybrid approach combines measurements and modeling. These measurements involve the measurement of the initial speed, direction and sometimes also the diameter of the grains. With a ballistic flight model the landing points are calculated. In this thesis the hybrid approach is applied: the spread pattern was predicted with a ballistic flight model based on the measurement of the horizontal outlet angle, the vertical outlet angle, the grain diameter, the grain density and the initial velocities. The horizontal outlet angle is the angle between the trajectory of the fertiliser grain and the radial line at the outlet position of the grain on the edge of the disc. The vertical outlet angle is the angle between the trajectory of the grains and the horizontal plane. Two dimensional imaging techniques were used to measure the horizontal outlet angle and the speed of the grains. First, a virtual camera was developed to assess the deviation caused by theperspective projection. It was found that in the center of the image the deviation on the horizontal outlet angle was below 1 &# 176; leading to an acceptable influence on the landing point in the field. Then a test spreader was used to make blurred images of the trajectories and to measure the horizontal outlet angle of two different spreader set ups: short vanes and long vanes. This method with one low cost camera mounted in the test spreader led to useful results for predicting the spread pattern: the mean horizontal outlet angle of the grain trajectories could be measured at different camera positions. The cylindrical spread pattern, measured with the test spreader, provided the mass distribution and allowed one to calculate the vertical outlet angle. However, the applied method did not give any information on the speed and the processing was partially manual and thus time consuming. Moreover, because the test spreader was a closed set the full spread pattern could not be measured which is necessary to validate the simulated spread patterns. Therefore, a new modular measurement device that tackled these shortcomings was proposed. This device consisted of two main parts: a test spreader and a measurement unit. As the arm with the measurement unit pivots on the center of the test device, the measurement unit traces a path around the circumference of the disc. The grains flying under the measurement unit were imaged using two different techniques: the high speed and a developed stroboscopic imaging technique. For the high speed technique a camera, type MotionXtra HG 100 K (Roper Scientific, New Jersey, USA), was mounted in the measurement unit. The stroboscopic technique used a specially designed LED stroboscope combined with the Nikon D 100 camera. Both techniques were able to visualize the grain flow but to extract information from the images, specific image processing was necessary. Filtering and morphological operations removed noise and made the segmentation, i. e. the recognition of the grains as objects in the image, possible. Several approaches were compared to develop a robust algorithm. Next, an efficient algorithm to detect the trajectories of the grains was developed. Finally, their direction and speed were deduced. A comparison between the more expensive high speed technique and the developed low cost stroboscopic technique was made. Also the differences between the short and long vanes were studied. Qualitatively, the strobe and the high speed technique gave very similar results for the angles and for the speeds. To quantitatively investigate the effects of the measurement technique, vane length and outlet positions, a regression analysis was performed. Using the short vanes increased the outlet angle with 1 %. The outlet speed of grains ejected by the short vanes was significantly lower than for the long vanes. Only for the speed measurement with the short vanes, both techniques gave statistically the same results. For the other cases, the high speed camera measured slightly higher values. The error for both techniques was the same. Overall the strobe technique and the high speed technique were capable of measuring the outlet angle and the outlet speed. Small differences between the measurements existed, but ultimately we were interested in the resulting spread pattern in the field. In this phase, all necessary inputs for simulating the spread pattern were available i. e. mass of the grains, vertical and horizontal outlet angle and outlet speed. These inputs were used to simulate four spread patterns: two spread patterns for the short vanes and two spread patterns for the long vanes based on the measurements of stroboscopic and the high speed technique, respectively. Next the real spread pattern of our set up was determined in a spread hall. The best correspondence between the measured and the simulated spread pattern was found when the regression function was used to generate the speed and the angles for each outlet positions on the disc in incremental steps of one degree. The relative error was 29. 2 % for the high speed technique and 30. 6 % for the strobe technique with the short vanes. Looking at the spread pattern of the long vanes, the relative errors for the strobe and the high speed technique were 29. 2 % and 29. 7 % respectively. The simulated spread patterns between the two techniques differed little with relative errors of 13. 2 % and 17. 0 %. The results were slightly better than the differences reported by Reumers et al. (2003 a), but clearly better than the differences Olieslagers (1997) found. Their spread patterns were calculated for a grid size of 1 m x 1 m. The DEM simulation of Van Liedekerke (2007) performed better with the same grid size as ours, but with a smaller total transverse spread distance. The transverse spread patterns however corresponded much better. This is an important result since the transverse spread pattern is generally used to evaluate spreaders in the field. Indeed, it means that the transverse pattern of our measurement technique could replace the method with the collector trays as it exists in the field. Two things will have to occur before farmers can use our development as a tool to adjust a spreader. First, we will need a new test set-up that allows a real spreader to be placed under the rotating arm, and second, a cylindrical collector will need to be designed. Replacing the collector tray method by our technique has some important advantages. The collector tray method is very time consuming and expensive. At least two, but preferably four people are needed to perform a test. A large number of collectors with inserted grids are needed. To achieve the desired distribution pattern in the field, several tests can be necessary and hence, lots of fertiliser is spilled. With our technique one person can perform the test, less fertiliser is used and all fertilizer is collected in the trays rather than spread out in the field. A cylindrical collector is needed to measure the mass distribution and the vertical angle. This is an important shortcoming of our method. Furthermore, the full spread pattern will result from the superposition of the spread pattern of both discs. Possible effects that arise from two discs that spread simultaneously are not yet investigated. Our set up preferably operates indoors. The set up can be disassembled and moved from one location to another, but is not fully mobile. A possible solution could be to equip the set up with wheels and a pull bar to make it transportable by car. Our technique could also be considered as a possible on board sensor to measure the spread pattern online, but this has not yet been investigated. The sensor should then also measure the size and the distribution of grains. The ambient light will certainly disturb the lighting and the image processing will have to be thoroughly adapted. Also important difficulties will arise from the vibrations and the movement of the spreader. Practical problems like dust and corrosion will also have to be solved. status: publishe...|$|E
