[...] Kayleigh Burn, writing for Chemical magazine, awarded the album five stars {{out of a}} possible five and felt that the band [...] "conquer the listener with a barrage of stunning vocals, memorable guitars and the recurring <b>hum</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> violins." [...] She opined that [...] "Hurricane" [...] was [...] "the best representation of a steadfast performance" [...] and commented that the album [...] "lends the opportunity for a tranquil and calm display of their abilities and more importantly, their hearts." [...] At the end of 2011, the Unplugged version of [...] "Hurricane" [...] won the MTV Award for Best Live Performance, with critic James Montgomery commenting that the band's performance [...] "is very much a communal thing, one where a celebration never seems all that far off." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{experiment}} {{consisted of}} making audio recordings of a Toyota Prius and combustion engine Honda Accord approaching from two directions at [...] {{to assure that}} the hybrid car operated only with its electric motor. Then test subjects in a laboratory listened to the recordings and indicated when they could hear from which direction the cars approached. Subjects could locate the <b>hum</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> internal combustion engine car at [...] away, but could not identify the hybrid running in electric mode until it came within , leaving just less than two seconds to react before the vehicle reached their position. In a second trial, the background sounds of two quietly idling combustion engine cars were added to the recordings to simulate the noise of a parking lot. Under this condition, the hybrid needed to be 74 percent closer than the conventional car before the subjects could hear from which direction the cars approached. Subjects could correctly judge the approach of the combustion car when it was about [...] feet away. This result means that under closer to normal environmental noise, a pedestrian {{would not be able to}} correctly determine the hybrid's approach until it was one second away.|$|E

Johnson's debut became a substantial success, as 9,400 copies were pressed, more than the latest release by one of Columbia's most established stars, Bessie Smith, and an additional pressing of 6,000 copies followed. His fifth recorded song, [...] "Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground", eventually <b>the</b> B-side <b>of</b> Johnson's second release, best exemplifies his unique guitar playing in open D tuning for slide. For the session, Johnson substituted a knife or penknife for the bottleneck and—according to Harris—he played with a thumb pick. His melancholy, indescribable <b>humming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guitar part creates <b>the</b> impression <b>of</b> [...] "unison moaning", a style of singing hymns that is common in southern African-American church choirs.

Duncan Sheik's [...] "A Body Goes Down", from his 1998 album Humming, was a response to Buckley's death.
