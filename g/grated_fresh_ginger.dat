5000|$|Sashimi is popularly {{served with}} a dipping sauce (soy sauce) and {{condiments}} such as with wasabi paste and <b>grated</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>ginger,</b> or, for meat sashimi, ponzu, and such garnishes as shiso and shredded daikon radish. Wasabi paste is sometimes mixed directly into soy sauce as a dipping sauce, which is generally not done when eating sushi. Another way to flavor soy sauce with wasabi is to place the wasabi mound into the soy sauce dish and then pour it in. This allows the wasabi to infuse the soy sauce more subtly. A reputed motivation for serving wasabi with sashimi (and also gari, pickled ginger), besides its flavor, is killing harmful bacteria and parasites that could be present in raw seafood. Other garnishes, more common in Japan than overseas, include red water pepper sprouts [...] (beni-tade) and a small chrysanthemum [...] (kogiku). The chrysanthemum, unlike other garnishes, {{is not intended to}} be eaten, and in cheap service (such as at supermarkets) may be substituted with a plastic flower.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The <b>fresh</b> <b>ginger</b> {{and ginger}} juice were {{analyzed}} for proximate composition, microbiological status, sensory attributes and overall storage stability. <b>Fresh</b> <b>gingers</b> were processed in sugar and other preservatives.

30|$|To {{determine}} the moisture content of <b>fresh</b> <b>ginger,</b> {{first it was}} carefully washed with tap water to remove adsorbed soil particulates and exposed to air to vaporize water {{on the surface of}} it.

The moisture content of four samples was between 75.0 – 84.9 %.

40|$|The Papua New Guinea {{government}} has stated {{its desire to}} increase income and reduce poverty through export-driven economic growth, including fresh produce.

A trial shipment of <b>fresh</b> <b>ginger</b> from Papua New Guinea passed the Biosecurity New Zealand inspection with ease and was considered to be of exportable quality, but no further shipments have occurred. In this paper the technical and financial viability of exporting <b>fresh</b> <b>ginger</b> from Papua New Guinea to New Zealand was assessed in terms of the following criteria: technical capability of meeting market requirements for consistency in quality and volume and dealing with quarantine and other market access issues; market opportunities for growth and sustainability; financial investments required and how they will be financed; and organisational/management capability of coordinating the ginger supply chain from farm to markets overseas. The conclusion was that exports of Papua New Guinea <b>fresh</b> <b>ginger</b> into the Page | 75 <b>Fresh</b> <b>ginger</b> exports from PNG to NZ Chang_Griffith_Maino New Zealand market would be both technically and financially infeasible.

40|$|Ginger {{is widely}} used as either a food product or an herbal {{medicine}} in the world. In this paper, a method was developed for determining volatile components in essential oils from both dried and <b>fresh</b> <b>ginger</b> by use of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and chemometric approaches. With the resolution improvement by chemometric methods upon two-dimensional data from GC-MS, the drifting baseline can be corrected. In addition, the peak purity can be assessed {{and the number of}} chemical components and their stepwise elution in the peak clusters can be identified. The peak clusters investigated are then resolved into pure chromatograms and related mass spectra for each of the components involved. Finally, with the pure chromatograms and related mass spectra obtained, the chemical components can be qualitatively identified based on the similarity searches in the MS databases and the chromatographic retention times. Quantitative determination can be conducted using the overall volume integration approach. The results showed that 140 and 136 components were separated and that 74 and 75 of them were tentatively identified, which accounted for about 62. 82 and 47. 11 % of the total relative content for dried and <b>fresh</b> <b>ginger,</b> respectively. In comparison with the chromatographic fingerprints of essential oils from dried and <b>fresh</b> <b>ginger,</b> 60 of the volatile components determined match with each other. The study demonstrated that the use of chemometric resolution based on two-dimensional data can mathematically enhance the separation ability of GC-MS and assist qualitative and quantitative determination of chemical components separated from complicated practical systems such as foods, herbal medicines, and environmental samples. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
