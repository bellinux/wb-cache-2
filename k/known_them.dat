5|$|Having {{served for}} many years as 'Moore's Coleridge Cottage Inn', the {{building}} was acquired for the nation in 1908, and the following year it was {{handed over to the}} National Trust. On 23 May 1998, following a £25,000 appeal by the Friends of Coleridge and the National Trust, two further rooms on the first floor were officially opened by Lord Coleridge a descendant of Samuel Taylor Coleridge. In 2011 the National Trust undertook a major re-presentation project that also saw the opening of additional rooms. The oldest parts of the cottage are now presented as the Coleridge family might have <b>known</b> <b>them,</b> with the original inglenook fireplace in the parlour uncovered and working once more. The garden was opened to visitors for the first time, complete with an 18th-century vegetable plot, a wildflower area and representations of Coleridge's animals. It is possible to listen to poetry at audio posts around the garden and the well is operational once more and {{can be seen in the}} small courtyard behind the cottage. A number of mementos of Coleridge are on display including his inkstand, locks of his hair and correspondence in his handwriting.|$|E

25|$|Cemeteries for {{deceased}} {{prisoners were}} gradually opened near the camps. It {{was a point}} of honour for the survivors {{to take care of}} their comrades’ final resting places. Most often, each nationality had its own reserved patch. In certain camps, such as Gardelegen, veritable monuments were erected. Roger Pelletier motivated his comrades: “Doesn’t it fall to us, who have <b>known</b> <b>them,</b> to all of us here who are their great family, to raise, in the cemetery where they rest, a monument of the French soul that, spreading above them like an aegis, will be above our dead, when we have left, as a memory and a goodbye?” Wilhelm Doegen estimates the number of dead in the camps at 118,159 but serious doubts surround this number, notably because Doegen failed to take certain diseases into account. Also according to Doegen, Russia suffered the heaviest losses (perhaps explained by the poorer nutrition of Russians, most of whom did not receive packages from their families) with a little over 70,000 dead, followed by France with 17,069 deaths, Romania with 12,512, and then Italy and the United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} book, Hipparchus {{assumes that the}} {{parallax}} of the Sun is 0, {{as if it is}} at infinite distance. He then analyzed a solar eclipse, which Toomer (against the opinion of over a century of astronomers) presumes to be the eclipse of 14 March 190. It was total in the region of the Hellespont (and in his birthplace, Nicaea); at the time Toomer proposes the Romans were preparing for war with Antiochus III in the area, and the eclipse is mentioned by Livy in his Ab Urbe Condita Libri VIII.2. It was also observed in Alexandria, where the Sun was reported to be obscured 4/5ths by the Moon. Alexandria and Nicaea are on the same meridian. Alexandria is at about 31° North, and the region of the Hellespont about 40° North. (It has been contended that authors like Strabo and Ptolemy had fairly decent values for these geographical positions, so Hipparchus must have <b>known</b> <b>them</b> too. However, Strabo's Hipparchus dependent latitudes for this region are at least 1° too high, and Ptolemy appears to copy them, placing Byzantium 2° high in latitude.) Hipparchus could draw a triangle formed by the two places and the Moon, and from simple geometry was able to establish a distance of the Moon, expressed in Earth radii. Because the eclipse occurred in the morning, the Moon was not in the meridian, and it has been proposed that as a consequence the distance found by Hipparchus was a lower limit. In any case, according to Pappus, Hipparchus found that the least distance is 71 (from this eclipse), and the greatest 81 Earth radii.|$|E
500|$|In 1938, Gandhi {{stated that}} his [...] "sympathies are {{all with the}} Jews. I have <b>known</b> <b>them</b> intimately in South Africa. Some of them became life-long companions." [...] Philosopher Martin Buber was highly {{critical}} of Gandhi's approach and in 1939 wrote {{an open letter to}} him on the subject. Gandhi reiterated his stance that [...] "the Jews seek to convert the Arab heart", and use [...] "satyagraha in confronting the Arabs" [...] in 1947. According to Simone Panter-Brick, Gandhi's political position on Jewish-Arab conflict evolved over the 1917-1947 period, shifting from a support for the Arab position first, and for the Jewish position in the 1940s.|$|E
500|$|On July 5, 2006, Robert Sorich, formally, {{director}} of the Mayor's Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and, informally, Daley's patronage chief, and Timothy McCarthy, Sorich's aide, were each convicted on two counts of mail fraud connected to rigging blue-collar city jobs and promotions. Sorich's best friend, former Streets and Sanitation official Patrick Slattery was convicted of one count of mail fraud. A former Streets and Sanitation managing deputy commissioner {{was found guilty of}} lying to federal agents about political hiring. Sorich, McCarthy and Slattery lived in the Bridgeport neighborhood in 11th Ward, the Daley family's home neighborhood and ward. [...] "I've never <b>known</b> <b>them</b> to be anything but hard working, and I feel for them at this difficult time," [...] Daley said. [...] "It is fair criticism to say I should have exercised greater oversight to ensure that every worker the city hired, regardless of who recommended them, was qualified and that proper procedures were always followed," [...] Daley admitted a few days later. Weeks later, David Axelrod, a Democratic political consultant whose clients included Daley, defended patronage in an op-ed in the Chicago Tribune.|$|E

500|$|At this time, {{the stocks}} {{of the air force}} in SWPA were low. At the recent Battle of Milne Bay, a Japanese {{invasion}} force had managed to sail past all but a few RAAF P-40 Kittyhawk and Lockheed Hudson aircraft, suffering only limited damage. Opinion at MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) was that [...] "the failure of the Air in this situation is deplorable; it will encourage the enemy to attempt further landings, with the assurance of impunity". Unable to provide MacArthur with what he most needed—more and better aircraft and the crews to man them—Arnold decided to replace Brett with Major General George C. Kenney. Arnold hoped that Kenney and the two newly minted brigadier generals could make the best use of what was available. [...] Major General George Kenney arrived in the theater on 28 July. Kenney knew Whitehead well, having served with him at Issoudun, the Air Corps Tactical School and GHQ Air Force, and had also served with Walker at the Air Corps Tactical School. [...] "I had <b>known</b> <b>them</b> both for over twenty years," [...] Kenney later wrote. [...] "They had brains, leadership, loyalty, and liked to work. If Brett had had them about three months earlier his luck might have been a lot better." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{track that}} {{underwent}} {{the most extensive}} change was [...] "I Miss You", an old song from the Debut era, {{the result of the}} input of Howie Bernstein (a protégé of Hooper and an aspiring programmer), who gave the song its [...] "Latin-tinged [...] ". Back in London, Björk contacted [...] "old standby" [...] Talvin Singh to record additional percussion parts for it. Fellow former Sugarcubes member Einar Örn Benediktsson was also contacted to play the trumpet on [...] "Enjoy". Renowned English sessionist Gary Barnacle was enlisted to play the saxophone. Although he had not been involved in music for a long time, Brazilian composer Eumir Deodato immediately agreed to participate on the album at Björk's request. The singer decided to contact him after being impressed by his arrangements of a rare Milton Nascimento song called [...] "Travessia". Deodato's presence as composer and conductor [...] "immediately bolstered" [...] "Hyperballad", [...] "You've Been Flirting Again" [...] and [...] "Isobel". This addition of strings, brass and percussion elements gave Post the balance Björk felt her original recordings had lacked. By the time the album was finished in April 1995, the list of co-producers included: Björk, Hooper, Bernstein, Massey, and Tricky. Björk has said: [...] "The people I collaborated with were all people I was hanging out with in clubs in London. I had <b>known</b> <b>them</b> all for a while before we ended up working together." ...|$|E
2500|$|Richard Bauckham {{states that}} while Papias was {{collecting}} his information (c. 90), Aristion and the elder John (who were Jesus' disciples) {{were still alive}} and teaching in Asia minor, and Papias gathered information from people who had <b>known</b> <b>them.</b> However, the exact identity of the [...] "elder John" [...] is {{wound up in the}} debate on the authorship of the Gospel of John, and scholars have differing opinions on that, e.g. Jack Finegan states that Eusebius may have misunderstood what Papias wrote, and the elder John may be a different person from the author of the fourth gospel, yet still a disciple of Jesus. Gary Burge, on the other hand sees confusion on the part of Eusebius and holds the elder John to be different person from the apostle John.|$|E

According to al-Bahri, bin Laden is hiding in the regions in Afghanistan or {{along the border with}} Pakistan. Malbrunot stated in an interview with Mark Colvin of PM that bin Laden is likely [...] "protected by tribes which are very loyal to him. These tribes, bin Laden has <b>known</b> <b>them</b> for the last 20 years.
