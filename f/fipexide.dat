50|$|<b>Fipexide</b> (Attentil, Vigilor) is a {{psychoactive drug}} of the {{piperazine}} chemical class which {{was developed in}} Italy in 1983. It {{was used as a}} nootropic drug in Italy and France, mainly for the treatment of senile dementia, but is no longer in common use due to the occurrence of rare adverse drug reactions including fever and hepatitis. <b>Fipexide</b> is similar in action to other nootropic drugs such as piracetam and bares a few similarities in chemical structure to centrophenoxine. Chemically, it is an amide union of parachlorophenoxyacetate and methylenedioxybenzylpiperazine (MDBZP), and has been shown to metabolize to the latter, which plays a significant role in its effects.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>fipexide,</b> {{administered}} at different intervals after the learning {{trial of a}} single step-through type passive avoidance situation was studied. The administration of <b>fipexide</b> immediately after the learning trial resulted in a long-lasting facilitation of passive avoidance behaviour. On the contrary, the administration of this compound 1 h prior to the retention test failed to influence passive avoidance behaviour. The results suggest that <b>fipexide</b> facilitates memory consolidation but does not influence retrieval processes...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{metabolism}} of the nootropic drug <b>fipexide</b> was studied using different liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) techniques. This drug has been {{withdrawn from the}} market due to toxic effects. No previous reports have investigated the possible involvement of reactive metabolites in the toxicity of <b>fipexide.</b> The hydrolysis of this drug leads {{to the formation of}} two potentially toxic species, 3, 4 -methylenedioxybenzylpiperazine (MDBP) and 4 -chlorophenoxyacetic acid (4 -CPA). Here, we investigate the in vitro metabolism of <b>fipexide</b> in human, rat, mouse and dog, as well as of MDBP and 4 -CPA in human and rat, while focusing on the formation of reactive metabolites. A combination of LC/MS analyses on a hybrid quadrupole-linear ion trap instrument and accurate mass data from QqTOF measurements was employed for the characterization of these metabolites. Microsomal metabolites of <b>fipexide</b> were MDBP, 4 -CPA, <b>fipexide</b> N-oxide or hydroxyl, demethylenated <b>fipexide</b> and other minor ones, all of which were investigated by tandem mass spectrometry. Reactive metabolites were detected using several trapping procedures with small molecules such as glutathione, its ethyl ester derivative and N-acetylcysteine. The demethylenated metabolite, a catechol, formed its corresponding ortho-quinone, which readily reacts with these nucleophiles. MDBP was studied in a similar manner, due to its ability to form an analogous catechol. Because of its acidic nature, 4 -CPA was assessed for possible acylglucuronide and acyl-CoA thioester metabolites, which could also be involved in bioactivation pathways. Several important metabolites were identified as potential mediators of toxicity via protein binding...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} a single oral dose of 400 mg <b>fipexide</b> on {{pituitary}} secretion was investigated in 10 elderly non-endocrine patients. <b>Fipexide</b> induced significant decrease (P less than 0. 05) in serum prolactin (PRL) values at 90 and 120 min after drug administration, without affecting serum growth hormone (GH), gonadotropin (LH and FSH), thyrotropin (TSH) and cortisol values. <b>Fipexide</b> was unable to modify metoclopramide-induced PRL release in five of these patients. Our results show that this drug acts as a mild dopamine (DA) agonist, probably not directly affecting hypothalamic and/or pituitary DA receptors but indirectly via a reduced DA re-uptake at the pre-synaptic level...|$|E
40|$|<b>Fipexide</b> is a {{nootropic}} drug, {{withdrawn from}} the market due to its idiosyncratic drug reactions causing adverse effects in man. Previous work on its metabolites has identified several potential reactive metabolites which could be implicated in protein binding. Here, we investigated the formation of these metabolites in rat and human hepatocytes. Based on these results, the o-quinone of <b>fipexide</b> (FIP), formed via the demethylenation reaction through a catechol intermediate, was chosen for further investigation. Studies were then pursued in order to relate this metabolite to protein binding, and thus better understand potential mechanisms for the toxicity of the parent compound. An assay was developed for determining the <b>fipexide</b> catechol-cysteine adduct in the microsomal protein fractions following in vitro incubations. This method digests the entire protein fraction into amino acids, followed by the detection of the Cys-metabolite adduct by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). We have designed a strategy where drug metabolism taking place in microsomal incubations and involved in protein binding can be assessed after the proteins have been digested, with the detection of the specific amino acid adduct. In this study, {{the structure of the}} <b>fipexide</b> adduct was hypothesized using knowledge previously gained in glutathione and N-acetylcysteine trapping experiments. Acetaminophen was used as a positive control for detecting a drug metabolite-cysteine adduct by LC/MS. This approach {{has the potential to be}} applicable as a protein-binding assay in early drug discovery without the need for radioactive compounds...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of targeted and untargeted analytical methods to support metabolomics studies has generated {{a paradigm shift}} in bioanalysis. In particular, liquid chromatography hyphenated to mass spectrometry has demonstrated the capability to quantify and identify thousands of compounds in biological samples using different instruments. Until recently, low and high resolution mass spectrometers were concomitantly used to achieve these goals. The recent {{development of}} fast-acquiring and sensitive high resolution mass spectrometers has {{opened the door to}} efficient and simultaneous qualitative and quantitative data acquisition. The central theme of this thesis was the investigation of these novel tools applied to drug metabolism and toxicology. The study of the metabolism of <b>fipexide,</b> a nootropic hepatotoxic drug, is described. The quantitative determination of acetaminophen (paracetamol) and its metabolites along with the measure of its adducts to proteins combined with untargeted analysis is also presented within the frame of a clinical study with overdosed patients...|$|E
