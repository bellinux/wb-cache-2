5|$|Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, a spirited, tough {{former lover}} of Indiana's. She is the {{daughter}} of Abner Ravenwood, Indiana Jones' mentor, and owns a bar in Nepal. Allen was cast after auditioning with Matheson and John Shea. Spielberg was interested in her, as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> performance in National Lampoon's Animal House. Sean Young had previously auditioned for the part, while Debra Winger turned it down.|$|E
25|$|Karen Susan Aldrich, {{a fellow}} patient at the {{hospital}} and friend to Conrad. Released three months before him, and likewise an unsuccessful suicide. When Conrad reads of her later, successful suicide in the newspaper, he is devastated as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> as a role model for his own successful recovery.|$|E
25|$|After <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> dancing as Lise in La Fille mal gardée in Paris in July 2012, Manuel Legris {{offered her}} to join the Vienna State Ballet as {{principal}} dancer telling her {{at the same time}} to stay the Paris Opera Ballet a little bit more. Mathilde Froustey didn't wait too long.|$|E
60|$|She {{breathes}} {{quickly and}} heavily, but she stands as unflinchingly as ever <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> {{in the midst}} of her grandest company.|$|R
6000|$|... "But Dick hasn't done anything. I am sure of it. Why, I don't think <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> {{since we}} stopped at her home that time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{supposed}} that {{father would have}} been pleased, anyway; for <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her,</b> and--and. Of course the girls haven't, but I think they might have trusted my judgment a little. I'm not quite a fool." ...|$|R
25|$|Aris died on his 53rd {{birthday}} on 27 March 1999. Since 1989, {{when his}} wife was first placed under house arrest, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> only five times, the last of which was for Christmas in 1995. She was also separated from her children, {{who live in the}} United Kingdom, but starting in 2011, they have visited her in Burma.|$|E
25|$|When Theseus {{abandoned}} Ariadne {{sleeping on}} Naxos, Dionysus found and married her. She bore him a son named Oenopion, but {{he committed suicide}} or was killed by Perseus. In some variants, he had her crown put into the heavens as the constellation Corona; in others, he descended into Hades to restore her to the gods on Olympus. Another different account claims Dionysus ordered Theseus to abandon Ariadne {{on the island of}} Naxos for <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> as Theseus carried her onto the ship and had decided to marry her.|$|E
500|$|Abrams {{asked her}} {{to play the role}} because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> {{previous}} work and liked it. Saldana had never seen the original series, though she had played a Trekkie in The Terminal (2004), but agreed to play the role after Abrams complimented her. [...] "For an actor, that's all you need, that's all you want. To get the acknowledgment and respect from your peers," [...] she said. She met with Nichelle Nichols, who explained to her how she had created Uhura's background and had named the character. Saldana's mother was a Star Trek fan and sent her voice mails during filming, giving advice on the part. Sydney Tamiia Poitier also auditioned for the part. The film officially establishes the character's first name, which had never been previously uttered on TV or in film. It also establishes (in an officially discreet manner) that Uhura and Spock are, in fact, lovers and had been romantically linked for some time during the film.|$|E
60|$|She read it, {{and said}} no more. Could <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> write on the wall? She did not know. Fate, it seemed, would have it this way, {{and there was nothing}} to do but to acquiesce.|$|R
50|$|The People must {{send someone}} {{to ask for}} forgiveness. They see that Hummingbird does not look starved {{like the rest of}} them, and he tells them <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> in the Fourth World, the one below this one.|$|R
6000|$|... "And then there's 'is love affair," [...] sighed Mrs. Silk. [...] "He'll {{never get}} {{over the loss of}} Amelia Kybird. I always know when <b>'e</b> <b>'as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her,</b> <b>he's</b> that miserable there's no getting a word out of 'im." ...|$|R
500|$|Elizabeth Device {{was charged}} with the murders of James Robinson, John Robinson and, {{together}} with Alice Nutter and Demdike, the murder of Henry Mitton. Elizabeth Device vehemently maintained her innocence. Potts records that [...] "this odious witch" [...] suffered from a facial deformity resulting in her left eye being set lower than her right. The main witness against Device was her daughter, Jennet, who was about nine years old. When Jennet was brought into the courtroom and asked {{to stand up and}} give evidence against her mother, Elizabeth, confronted with her own child making accusations that would lead to her execution, began to curse and scream at her daughter, forcing the judges to have her removed from the courtroom before the evidence could be heard. Jennet was placed on a table and stated that she believed her mother had been a witch for three or four years. She also said her mother had a familiar called Ball, who appeared {{in the shape of a}} brown dog. Jennet claimed to have witnessed conversations between Ball and her mother, in which Ball had been asked to help with various murders. James Device also gave evidence against his mother, saying <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> making a clay figure of one of her victims, John Robinson. Elizabeth Device was found guilty.|$|E
500|$|Although {{both were}} subpoenaed as {{witnesses}} neither Fortune nor Judith Natus {{were called to}} the stand, the attorney responsible later explaining that the mob outside may have intimidated several witnesses. [...] Susannah Wells's neighbours were turned away by the mob and her daughter and half-brother were quickly recognised and stopped. [...] However, three witnesses found in Dorset by George Squires, to testify for his mother, passed by unrecognised. [...] The first, John Gibbons, said that the Squires had visited his house in Abbotsbury [...] "with handkerchiefs, lawns, muslins, and checks, to sell about town" [...] from 1–9January. [...] This was corroborated by his neighbour, William Clarke. [...] Squires's last witness, Thomas Greville, claimed that he had accommodated Mary and [...] "her sister and her brother" [...] under his roof in Coombe, on 14January, where they sold [...] "handkerchiefs, lawns, and such things". [...] This was contradicted by John Iniser, a fishmonger around Waltham Cross and Theobalds. [...] Insier claimed he knew Squires by sight {{and that in the}} three weeks before her arrest <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> telling fortunes in the neighbourhood of Wells's house. [...] Wells, whose witnesses had been unable to pass by the mob outside, was able to offer only two sentences in her defence. [...] She told the court that she had not seen Canning before 1February, and that [...] "as to Squires, I never saw her above a week and a day before we were taken up." [...] According to a contemporary report in the [...] London Daily Advertiser, as the three witnesses left the court the mob, waiting in the yard, [...] "beat them, kicked them rolled them in the Kennel and otherwise misused them before they suffered them to get from them".|$|E
2500|$|Of Eakins' later portraits, many took {{as their}} {{subjects}} {{women who were}} friends or students. Unlike most portrayals of women at the time, they are devoid of glamor and idealization. For Portrait of Letitia Wilson Jordan (1888), Eakins painted the sitter wearing the same evening dress in which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> at a party. She is a substantial presence, a vision {{quite different from the}} era's fashionable portraiture. So, too, his Portrait of Maud Cook (1895), where the obvious beauty of the subject is noted with [...] "a stark objectivity".|$|E
6000|$|... "I deny it. I utterly deny it," [...] said Eleanor, {{jumping from}} her seat and {{literally}} flashing before Mr. Arabin, as {{she stood on the}} drawing-room floor. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> never <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> so excited, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> never <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> look half so beautiful.|$|R
50|$|Edmund {{returns to}} the lamp-post, where he is reunited with Lucy, who tells him that she <b>has</b> been to <b>see</b> Tumnus again. When she {{describes}} the White Witch, Edmund realises that she is no other than the lady <b>he</b> <b>has</b> just made friends with, {{but he does not}} let on that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
50|$|But that is {{the least}} of Special Branch's worries, if Elder's well-honed intuition is correct. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> work before and knows {{her to be a}} {{resourceful}} enemy, who always seems a step ahead of the authorities. With an imminent summit of world leaders to be held in London, Witch's target seems obvious.|$|R
2500|$|Jeffrey and Diane Crone Frank {{have noted}} that the fairy tale [...] "was no doubt {{inspired}} by Andersen's crush on Jenny Lind, {{who was about to}} become famous throughout Europe and the United States as the Swedish Nightingale. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> that fall, when she was performing in Copenhagen. Copenhagen's celebrated Tivoli Gardens opened that season, and its Asian fantasy motif was even more pronounced than it is today. Andersen had been a guest at the opening in August and returned for a second visit in October. In his diary that night he wrote: 'At Tivoli Gardens. Started the Chinese fairy tale.' He finished it in two days." ...|$|E
2500|$|Most of {{the cast}} {{was made up of}} actors with whom Weitz had {{previously}} worked. He directed Marcia Gay Harden in American Dreamz and decided to cast her as Elle's daughter, since she was the only actress he suggested for the role whom Tomlin [...] "seemed mildly intimidated by". He cast Nat Wolff and John Cho after working with them on Admission and American Pie, respectively; he had also worked with Judy Greer twice before. He contacted Sam Elliott through his brother, Chris Weitz, who had directed Elliott in The Golden Compass. Weitz offered the role of Sage to Julia Garner after seeing her performance in Electrick Children. He wrote Laverne Cox's character for her because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> in Orange Is the New Black, and they refined the details of the character together.|$|E
60|$|She {{was dressed}} as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> previously, {{but for a}} cluster of holly berries at her breast.|$|E
60|$|Rochester {{walked by}} her side, puzzled. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> never <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> like this.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her!</b> <b>He</b> met Mr. Downton last Christmas in Regent Street, in a swell carriage, with a {{lady with}} such carrots, he thought her bonnet was on fire; and Mr. Downton never saw Price, though he bowed to him, {{and you know}} nobody would marry a woman with red hair unless she was an heiress.' ...|$|R
50|$|Edmund {{returns to}} the lamp-post where he comes across Lucy, who tells him that she saw Tumnus again, and that the White Witch {{has done nothing to}} him for letting her go. When she {{describes}} the White Witch, Edmund realises that she is no other than the lady <b>he</b> <b>has</b> just met, but he does not let on that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> {{but three}} times--and his {{throbbing}} heart {{lay in the}} hollow of her cold white hand.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} he thought that Ruth had not come to meet him. Then his heart leaped madly. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|His supper, {{which was}} brought to him there, and spread upon the little table where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> working, {{diverted}} his attention.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>had</b> {{heard much}} of Dea Flavia--the {{daughter}} of Claudius Octavius {{and now the}} ward of the Emperor Caligula--since his return from Syria a year ago, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> oft <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> gilded and rose-draped litter gliding along the Sacra Via or the Via Appia, surrounded with its numberless retinue: but <b>he</b> <b>had</b> never <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> so close as this, nor <b>had</b> <b>he</b> heard her speak.|$|R
60|$|Leyton, still flushed, {{and with}} eyebrows {{slightly}} knit, said, awkwardly, that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> scarcely <b>seen</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said; and then, {{finding that}} it was not {{possible}} that he should hear her through her veil, she raised it. She was very pale, and there was a look of painful care, almost of agony, round <b>her</b> mouth. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> never <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> look so pale,--but he said to himself {{at the same time that}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> never <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> look so beautiful.|$|R
6000|$|On this {{question}} there arose the edifying brow-beating, customary on such points. First of all, Mr. Winkle {{said it was}} quite {{impossible for him to}} say how many times he had seen Mrs. Bardell. Then he was asked if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> twenty times, to which he replied, 'Certainly--more than that.' Then he was asked whether he hadn't seen her a hundred times--whether he couldn't swear that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> more than fifty times--whether he didn't know that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> at least seventy-five times, and so forth; the satisfactory conclusion which was arrived at, at last, being, that he had better take care of himself, and mind what he was about. The witness having been by these means reduced to the requisite ebb of nervous perplexity, the examination was continued as follows-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who! why, Beatrice--whom {{else could}} a man want to marry, if once <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her.</b> But {{she will not}} have me; she hates me." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{last time}} <b>HE</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her,</b> poor Eustacie had been {{incapable}} of seeing anything save that bloody {{pool at the}} foot of the stairs.|$|E
5000|$|In Māori mythology, Hinauri is {{the sister}} of Māui and the wife of Irawaru. Māui becomes annoyed with Irawaru and {{stretches}} out his limbs, turning him into a dog. When Hinauri asks Māui if <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> husband, Māui tells her to call “Moi! Moi!” whereupon the poor dog runs up, and Hinauri, learning the truth, throws herself into the sea (Tregear 1891:107).|$|R
6000|$|... "His {{regard for}} her, {{infinitely}} surpassing anything that Willoughby ever felt or feigned, as much more warm, as more sincere or constant--which ever {{we are to}} call it--has subsisted through all the knowledge of dear Marianne's unhappy prepossession for that worthless young man!--and without selfishness--without encouraging a hope!--could <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> happy with another--Such a noble mind!--such openness, such sincerity!--no one can be deceived in HIM." ...|$|R
60|$|He liked that, {{and knew}} <b>her,</b> for <b>he</b> <b>had</b> often <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> when <b>he</b> rode through the wood.|$|R
