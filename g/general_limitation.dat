25|$|In June 1990, after a {{favourable}} opinion from the Government's law officers, {{it was decided}} to use the power to issue a <b>general</b> <b>limitation</b> on local government budgets in all authorities which had been enacted in the Rates Act 1984 but had remained unused until then. This decision removed most local government financial autonomy. This 'universal capping' continued from the 1991–92 financial year until 1998–99; when it was ended the Secretary of State took reserve powers under the Local Government Act 1999 to regulate increases in the Council Tax (which had replaced the Community Charge). The Secretary of State was also allowed to require reduction in individual local authorities' budgets.|$|E
25|$|A <b>general</b> <b>limitation</b> to {{the spatial}} {{resolution}} of this method is given by the blurring in the analyzer crystal which arises from dynamical refraction, i.e. the angular deviation of the beam due to the refraction in the sample is amplified about ten thousand times in the crystal, because the beam path within the crystal depends strongly on its incident angle. This effect can be reduced by thinning down the analyzer crystal, e.g. with an analyzer thickness of 40 m a resolution of about 6 m was calculated. Alternatively the Laue crystals can be replaced by Bragg crystals, so the beam doesn´t pass through the crystal but is reflected on the surface.|$|E

We demonstrate that the histogram method is the most accurate for measurements of small vertical distances (andlt; 0. 5 nm) and generally should be applied to epitaxial graphene and similar types of samples {{in order to get}} the correct and reproducible values. Experimental determination of the step height between different domains of epitaxial graphene shows excellent agreement with the predicted values once the adsorption of a 2 D monolayer is taken into account on top of the one layer graphene. In contrast to <b>general</b> <b>limitations</b> of AFM topography, electrostatic force microscopy imaging allows a straightforward identification of domains of epitaxial graphene of different thickness.

5000|$|For Foreign Tax Credit purposes, {{certain types}} of income are re-{{character}}ized (looked-through) based {{on the character of}} the income underlying the payment. [...] Dividends received from a 10% or more owned controlled foreign corporation (CFC) with respect to which the recipient is a U.S. shareholder (whether or not the controlling shareholder) are re-characterized based on the earnings and profits (E&P) of the payor CFC. Interest, rents and royalties received from a similar CFC are recharacterized based on the type of income to which the payor must allocate and apportion the corresponding item of expense. Thus, if a Swiss corporation that has two owners, both U.S., pays its 20% owner interest of $1,000 and under allocation and apportionment principles its interest expense must be apportioned 42% to passive and 58% to <b>general</b> <b>limitation</b> income, then the interest income of that U.S. person from the Swiss corporation is $420 passive and $580 <b>general</b> <b>limitation,</b> and only the passive income constitutes FPHCI.|$|E
