40|$|ABSTRACT A {{technique}} is described whereby avian egg contents {{removed from the}} shell after 72 hours of normal incubation may be successfully cultured for {{extended periods of time}} (81 % for 15. 5 days), many of the embryos reaching Hamilton-Hamburger Stage 40 - 41 (14 - 15 days). Egg contents are suspended in commercial plastic wrap held in place in culture vessels consisting of modified Playtex nurser holders. Culture vessels are lowered into Kerr wide mouth quart mason jar saturation humidity chambers which have been attached to aquarium lines inside of a modified Forma model 329 C 0 2 incubator. Use of a 5 - 8 % C 0 2 atmosphere substantially improved embryonic survivability. POULTRY SCIENCE 53 : 409 - 412, 1974 SHELL-LESS culture of the avian embryo has interested many embryologists whose techniques are reviewed by Ramsey and Boone (1972). The present technique incor-porates commercial plastic wrap in which to suspend egg contents (Schlesinger, 1966) in a culture vessel placed in a saturation humidi-ty chamber (Vollmar, 1935) to prevent evapo-ration from the cultured egg contents. Criley (1971) found that maximum embryonic sur-vival could be obtained using eggs incubated for 72 hours prior to culture and that periodic gas exchange enhances survivability. Mo-scona and Carneckas (1959) concluded that a 5 - 8 % C 0 2 atmosphere applied to normal eggs fenestrated on the eighth day of incuba-tion prevents the onset of <b>keratogenic</b> meta-plasia in the chick chorion and it is "not unlikely that in normal development, C 0 2 promotes the respiratory differentiation of the chorion [...] .

40|$|As a key {{component}} of the ocular surface required for vision, the cornea has been extensively studied as a site for cell and tissue-based therapies. Historically, these treatments have consisted of donor corneal tissue transplants, but cultivated epithelial autografts have become established over the last 15 years as a routine treatment for ocular surface disease. Ultimately, these treatments are performed with the intention of restoring corneal transparency and a smooth ocular surface. The degree of success, however, is often dependent upon the inherent level of corneal inflammation at time of treatment. In this regard, the anti-inflammatory and immuno-modulatory properties of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have drawn attention to these cells as potential therapeutic agents for corneal repair. The origins for MSC-based therapies are founded in part on observations of the recruitment of endogenous bone marrow-derived cells to injured corneas, however, an increasing quantity of data is emerging for MSC administered following their isolation and ex vivo expansion from a variety of tissues including bone marrow, adipose tissue, umbilical cord and dental pulp. In brief, evidence has emerged of cultured MSC, or their secreted products, having a positive impact on corneal wound healing and retention of corneal allografts in animal models. Optimal dosage, route of administration and timing of treatment, however, all remain active areas of investigation. Intriguingly, amidst these studies, have emerged reports of MSC transdifferentiation into corneal cells. Clearest evidence has been obtained with respect to expression of markers associated with the phenotype of corneal stromal cells. In contrast, the evidence for MSC conversion to corneal epithelial cell types remains inconclusive. In any case, the conversion of MSC into corneal cells seems unlikely to be an essential requirement for their clinical use. This field of research has recently become more complicated by reports of MSC-like properties for cultures established from the peripheral corneal stroma (limbal stroma). The relationship and relative value of corneal-MSC compared to traditional sources of MSC such as bone marrow are at present unclear. This chapter is divided into four main parts. After providing a concise overview of corneal structure and function, we will highlight the types of corneal diseases that are likely to benefit from the anti-inflammatory and immuno-modulatory properties of MSC. We will subsequently summarize the evidence supporting the case for MSC-based therapies in the treatment of corneal diseases. In the third section we will review the literature concerning the <b>keratogenic</b> potential of MSC. Finally, we will review the more recent literature indicating the presence of MSC-like cells derived from corneal tissue...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{elucidate}} pathogenic mechanisms of different forms of human HSV keratitis. HSV infection of the corneal epithelium causes a classical dendritic shaped lesion. Many studies could explain the development and growth in dendritic keratitis, {{but none of these}} found the anatomical substrate for the linear branching pattern. The most obvious explanation would be, that the shape of dendritic ulcers corresponds with the anatomical pattern of innervating nerves of the cornea. In chapter 2 a relationship between the shape of dendritic ulcers in infectious epithelial keratitis and the subbasal nerve plexus of the corneal epithelium is postulated. Recurrence of HSV keratitis is a common complication after PKP for corneal opacities resulting from HSV infection. After PKP, for reasons unrelated to HSV keratitis, epithelial defects may still be caused by HSV. In chapter 3 the incidence of newly acquired HSV keratitis after PKP is determined and possible contributing factors are assessed. Several possibilities as to the origin of the infecting HSV exist. These include reactivation oflatent virus in the trigeminal ganglion, horizontal spread, or transmission through the donor cornea. To test the assumption of graft-to-host transmission of HSV by PKP, surplus corneal material was examined for the presence of HSV DNA. Because the amount of viral DNA available could be very limited, a new method independent of viral culture, was developed to allow distinction between different virus strains. The newly developed technique was used to test our hypothesis that graft-to-host transmission of HSV is possible. This new method was used to determine the incidence of HSV- 1 superinfection in patients with recurrent HSV keratitis. Although HSK has been studied extensively in the mouse model, {{it is not clear what}} triggers the immune response and to what extent the mouse data correlate with findings in human keratitis. The most logical idea, that virus-derived proteins are the eliciting factor for the immune response, has been ruled out in the experimental HSK mouse model. Alternative sources of the <b>keratogenic</b> antigens, like auto-antigens, have been suggested. Data on the pathogenesis of human HSK are limited. Therefore, in chapter 4 the antigenspecificity of corneal T cells in HSK patients was investigated. Besides this, corneas of patients with HSK were examined for the presence of corneal antigen reactive T cells (auto-reactive T cells). Chapter 5 provides a concise summary of the data generated in the framework of this thesis, and concludes with an overall discussion of the data and their possible impact on current ophthalmologic practice...|$|E
