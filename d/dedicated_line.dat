5|$|In {{addition}} to the 39 locomotives delivered to NdeM, GE built two E60C-2s for the Deseret-Western Railway. The Deseret-Western, like the Black Mesa and Lake Powell Railroad, was a <b>dedicated</b> <b>line</b> hauling coal between a mine and a power station. The line opened in 1984. The Deseret-Western, now called the Deseret Power Railroad, supplemented its fleet with two ex-NdeM locomotives in the late 1990s, and another three in the 2000s.|$|E
5|$|Selfridges {{was bombed}} again on 17 April 1941, {{suffering}} further damage, including {{the destruction of}} the Palm Court Restaurant. The basement was converted to a communications base, with a <b>dedicated</b> <b>line</b> run along Oxford Street to Whitehall, and allowed British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to make secure and direct telephone calls to the US President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The store was damaged again on 6 December 1944 after a V2 rocket exploded on nearby Duke Street, causing its Christmas tree displays to collapse into the street outside. Damage was quickly repaired and the shop re-opened the following day.|$|E
5|$|The {{early history}} of Marylebone is tied into the Great Central Railway (GCR)'s Great Central Main Line (GCML) {{extension}} into London. When Sir Edward Watkin became chairman of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS) in 1864, the line was not particularly lucrative as it had no direct connection to London. Watkin was unhappy about transferring traffic to the Great Northern Railway, and when he became chairman of the Metropolitan Railway in 1872, he decided to build a <b>dedicated</b> <b>line</b> between the MS and Central London.|$|E

5|$|LOCOG faced further {{criticism}} for how it handled {{the sale of}} tickets for the wheelchair areas within venues. In May 2012 the online sale of tickets for wheelchair areas {{was replaced by a}} dedicated telephone hotline. Organisers were criticised for their use of an 0844 revenue share number for this hotline, and for neglecting to mention on its ticketing website that calls would be charged by the minute. Former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe viewed this as discrimination against wheelchair users, and called upon LOCOG to compensate those who had used the hotline. LOCOG denied that it was receiving additional profits from the phone line, and claimed that a <b>dedicated</b> <b>line</b> was being used to allow customers to receive a service tailored to their individual accessibility needs.|$|E

40|$|We analyse {{maintenance}} cost data for Swedish railway infrastructure {{in relation to}} traffic volumes and network characteristics, and separate the cost impact from passenger and freight trains. Lines with mixed passenger and freight traffic, and <b>dedicated</b> freight <b>lines</b> are analysed separately using both log-linear and Box-Cox regression models. We find that for mixed lines, the Box-Cox specification is preferred, while a log-linear model is chosen {{in the case of}} <b>dedicated</b> freight <b>lines.</b> The cost elasticity with respect to output is found to be higher for passenger trains than for freight trains in the case of mixed lines. The cost elasticity for freight trains on <b>dedicated</b> <b>lines</b> is higher than for freight trains on mixed lines. From a marginal cost pricing perspective, freight trains on mixed lines are currently over-charged, while passenger trains on mixed lines and freight trains on <b>dedicated</b> <b>lines</b> are under-charged...|$|R

2500|$|Later {{revisions}} of the PCI specification add support for message-signaled interrupts. In this system, a device signals its need for service by performing a memory write, rather than by asserting a <b>dedicated</b> <b>line.</b> [...] This alleviates the problem of scarcity of interrupt lines. [...] Even if interrupt vectors are still shared, it does not suffer the sharing problems of level-triggered interrupts. [...] It also resolves the routing problem, because the memory write is not unpredictably modified between device and host. [...] Finally, because the message signaling is in-band, it resolves some synchronization problems that can occur with posted writes and out-of-band interrupt lines.|$|E
2500|$|A {{passageway}} may {{consist of}} two or more parallel lines that take different routes between the same cities, branch and connector lines, and in some cases, connecting lines and lower-speed lines. [...] The Beijing-Shanghai HSR Passageway, one of the verticals, comprises the preexisting Beijing-Shanghai HSR, which runs through Tianjin, Jinan, Bengbu, Nanjing, Wuxi and Suzhou, as well as a new high-speed passenger <b>dedicated</b> <b>line</b> from Beijing to Shanghai via Tianjin, Dongying, Weifang, Linyi, Huaian, Yangzhou, and Nantong, as well as HSRs connecting Nanjing, Hefei and Shanghai with Hangzhou. [...] Some passageways consists of a single HSR line; the Shanghai-Kunming HSR Passageway, one of the horizontals, is essentially the Shanghai–Kunming High-Speed Railway by another name.|$|E

Furthermore, by comparing to results in Tang and Teunter [Tang, O., Teunter, R. H., 2006. Economic lot scheduling problem with returns.
