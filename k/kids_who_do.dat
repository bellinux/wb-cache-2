Abstract The submitted dissertation {{is focused on}} the observation of difficulties in the drawing development of preschool children. Drawing is a typical means of expression of a child, it is often considered as a spontaneous and natural activity. Nevertheless in the population of preschool children we may find some <b>kids</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not draw at all, or they start to draw at a much later stage than it is common amongst the ordinary population, or they may also react negatively to drawing. Within this work a phenomenon in which the child's drawing distinctively does not correspond to his cognitive abilities due to the risk of a specific disability of drawing adoption (dyspinxia) or due to another crisis of imaging in the preschool age. The focus of the research lies in the processing of quantitative methods (intellectual abilities test, drawing tests), however additional information is also derived from the qualitative methods (anamnesis, interview, observation, essay). In the methodology a new evaluation system for the scoring of children's drawings regardless of the depicted theme is introduced.

40|$|Background: Military {{adolescents}} {{experience more}} behavioral risk factors, {{such as depression}} and suicidal ideation than civilian adolescents and often have difficulty adjusting to the many changes inherent {{in the lives of}} military-connected children. Eighty percent of military-connected children attend civilian public-schools and often have difficulty adjusting to new school environments. Furthermore, military culture is often misunderstood by non-military school personnel. Objectives: Explore the environment of adolescents who attend public schools and its relationship to effective coping or resilience with regard to parental deployment. Methods: Individual interviews with adolescents and school staff were conducted in a high school in a rural county of eastern NC. Limited participant observation and examination of relevant documents were utilized as well. The county is the home of a major US military base. All the student participants attended public school and have experienced at least one recent parental deployment. Conventional content analysis was used to interpret the data. Results: The military-connected adolescents in schools (MCAS) in this study demonstrated resilience in terms of the constant changes they experience as result of being a MCAS. They express a gamut of emotions in dealing with everyday life among the turmoil of adolescence and the challenges of having one or more parents who are active in the military. They strive to be normal <b>kids</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> normal things with normal people. They immerse themselves in many activities in and around the public-school environment to live their lives to the fullest. Discussion: This study suggests that nursing practice can be enhanced when the assessment includes status of parental deployment. In the school setting, the school nurse should be aware of when deployment occurs and how deployment influences adolescent feelings and emotions. A better understanding of this unique population will further the Healthy People 2020 goal to improve the development, health, safety, and well-being of military-connected adolescents...|$|E
40|$|Lifestyle {{diseases}} characterize those diseases whose occurrence {{is primarily}} {{based on the}} daily habits of people and {{are a result of}} an inappropriate relationship of people with their environment. The main factors contributing to lifestyle diseases include bad food habits, physical inactivity, wrong body posture, and disturbed biological clock. A report, jointly prepared by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Economic Forum, says India will incur an accumulated loss of $ 236. 6 billion by 2015 on account of unhealthy lifestyles and faulty diet. According to the report, 60 % of all deaths worldwide in 2005 (35 million) resulted from noncommunicable diseases and accounted for 44 % of premature deaths. What's worse, around 80 % of these deaths will occur in low and middle-income countries like India which are also crippled by an ever increasing burden of infectious diseases, poor maternal and perinatal conditions and nutritional deficiencies. According to a survey conducted by the Associated Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ASSOC-HAM), 68 % of working women in the age bracket of 21 - 52 years were found to be afflicted with lifestyle ailments such as obesity, depression, chronic backache, diabetes and hypertension. The study ‘Preventive Healthcare and Corporate Female Workforce’ also said that long hours and working under strict deadlines cause up to 75 % of working women to suffer from depression or general anxiety disorder, compared to women with lesser levels of psychological demand at work. The study cited scientific evidence that healthy diet and adequate physical activity - at least 30 minutes of moderate activity at least five days a week - helped prevent NCDs. In India, 10 % of adults suffer from hypertension while the country is home to 25 - 30 million diabetics. Three out of every 1, 000 people suffer a stroke. The number of deaths due to heart attack is projected to increase from 1. 2 million to 2 million in 2010. The diet [or lifestyle] of different populations might partly determine their rates of cancer, and the basis for this hypothesis was strengthened by results of studies showing that people who migrate from one country to another generally acquire the cancer rates of the new host country, suggesting that environmental [or lifestyle factors] rather than genetic factors are the key determinants of the international variation in cancer rates. Some of the common diseases encountered because of occupational lifestyle are Alzheimer's disease, arteriosclerosis, cancer, chronic liver disease/cirrhosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, nephritis/CRF, and stroke. Occupational lifestyle diseases include those caused by the factors present in the vicinity like heat, sound, dust, fumes, smoke, cold, and other pollutants. These factors are responsible for allergy, respiratory and hearing problems, and heat or cold shock. So, A healthy lifestyle must be adopted to combat these diseases with a proper balanced diet, physical activity and by giving due respect to biological clock. Kids spending too much time slouched in front of the TV or PCs, should be encourage to find a physical sport or activity they enjoy. Fun exercises should be encouraged into family outings. A pizza-and-video evening should be replaced for a hike and picnic. <b>Kids</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> participate in sport, especially at a high competitive level, can find the pressure to succeed very stressful. To decrease the ailments caused by occupational postures, one should avoid long sitting hours and should take frequent breaks for stretching or for other works involving physical movements...|$|E

The review, written by Jay Cantor, who went on to literary prominence himself, provides a more moderate description of Kesey and his Pranksters.

We are left with another acid-head and a bunch of kooky <b>kids</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> a few krazy things.” Cantor explains how Kesey was offered the opportunity by a judge to speak to the masses and curb the use of LSD. Kesey, who Wolfe idolizes for starting the movement, is left powerless in his opportunity to alter the movement. Cantor is also critical of Wolfe’s praise for the rampant abuse of LSD. Cantor admits the impact of Kesey in this scenario, stating that the drug was in fact widespread by 1969, when he wrote his criticism. [...] He questions the glorification of such drug use however, challenging the ethical attributes of reliance on such a drug, and further asserts that “LSD is no respecter of persons, of individuality”.|$|R

DGC issued {{a new version of the}} album with reworked packaging to the stores in March 1994. This version featured edited album artwork, listed the name of [...] "Rape Me" [...] as [...] "Waif Me", and included a Scott Litt remix of [...] "Pennyroyal Tea". [...] A spokesperson for Nirvana explained that the band decided to edit the packaging because as kids Cobain and Novoselic were only able to buy music from the two chain stores; as a result they [...] "really want to make their music available to <b>kids</b> <b>who</b> <b>dont</b> have the opportunity to go to mom-and-pop stores".|$|R
