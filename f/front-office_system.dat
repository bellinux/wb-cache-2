An STP policy is then an indirect means to compel traders to capture on their own. Moreover, IT-based trade-capture, in the shortest time from actual negotiation, is growingly seen, over the years, as a “best practice” or even a rule.|$|E

More specifically, we present results from an evaluation study of alternative <b>front-office</b> <b>system</b> designs. The front-office is the part of a service-oriented organisation where the services required by a customer and offered by the service provider are agreed upon. In this paper an approach is presented to formally evaluate the complexity of alternative <b>front-office</b> <b>system</b> designs. This complexity assessment method integrates two techniques: conceptual modeling and software artifact complexity measurement. The results of the complexity assessment are part of a balanced approach towards determining the optimal level of service customisation for a company. I...|$|E

This approach is based on two concepts: object-oriented business modeling and distance measurement. The former concept is used to visualize changes in the business layer of an information system architecture. The latter concept is used to quantify these changes. The paper also describes the application of our approach {{in the context of}} <b>front-office</b> <b>system</b> design. status: publishe...|$|E

TIGRA developed a distributed system architecture for integrating different financial <b>front-office</b> trading <b>systems</b> with middle- and back-office applications. We generalize the experience by proposing an architectural style that can be re-used for similar enterprise application integration tasks. The TIGRA style {{is based on a}} separation of data representation using domain-specific XML languages from transport of those data with an appropriate middleware. We show how Markup languages, particularly the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT), can be used to solve semantic data integration problems. We discuss that the strengths of middleware and markup languages are complementary and indicate the synergies yielded by deploying middleware and markup in the TIGRA style...|$|R

40|$|Abstract/ Summary Customer {{self-service}} technology such as self-check-in kiosks {{has been}} implemented successfully at airports. Travellers {{seem to have}} accepted this technology and have {{become familiar with the}} concept. Self-service kiosks are currently also introduced in some American, European and Asian hotels. However, New Zealand hotels have not yet generally taken advantage of this technology. This study researches hotel managers’ views on the advantages and concerns of these self-service kiosks and their impact on customers and the hotel’s front-office operations. In addition, the managers’ concerns, related to introducing the kiosks are discussed. The aim {{of this study was to}} gain the perspectives of managers from New Zealand’s four and five star hotels regarding the impacts of self-service technologies (SSTs) on the hotel’s front-office operations and guests. A qualitative, case study research methodology was used in this research, to understand the managers’ perceptions and impacts of the self-service technologies. The research was conducted through ten semi-structured interviews and common themes which were found to be important to these participants were discussed. The research highlighted that managers had certain reservations towards SSTs, which may explain why they have not yet been implemented in New Zealand. The main reasons expressed were that personal service is vital in four and five star hotels, especially for leisure guests who like the friendly interactions with employees. Additionally, the costs to implement and interface the kiosks are significant and need adequate justification either through adding value for the guests or reducing costs for the hotel. There also may be some difficulty in interfacing the kiosks with each hotel property’s <b>front-office</b> <b>system</b> and the local New Zealand banking system. Finding the appropriate kiosks for each property would be imperative for SSTs to be a success. Managers believed that there are significant benefits associated with introducing SSTs in hotels. For the customer, managers felt that kiosks enabled benefits such as allowing check-in efficiency, additional guest-control, customised service interactions, choice of communication language for foreign travellers and easy, standardised service interactions. Managers felt that kiosks would predominantly benefit corporate and regular travellers, due to the efficiency and speedy self-check-in process. For the hotel, managers viewed kiosks as being able to lower labour costs, alleviating pressure on check-in staff during busy periods, enabling easier data access for customer-profiling and improving revenues through customised up-selling. Also the introduction of kiosks is predicted by some managers to revolutionise the hotel lobby and evolve employee roles, where service staff may greet guests on the lobby floor rather than from behind the reception desk, and spend more time creating closer relationships, adding to the guests’ hotel experience and being more customer-orientated. This study in New Zealand found that the majority of managers supported the introduction of self-check-in kiosks as an alternative value offering, as long as the kiosks were introduced as complimentary to service staff. Well-trained and friendly staff, in their opinion, would always be vital for guest satisfaction and reducing staff numbers would lower the hotel’s service standards...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a distributed system architecture {{that supports the}} integration of different <b>front-office</b> trading <b>systems</b> with middle and back-office systems, each {{of which have been}} procured from different vendors. The architecture uses a judicious combination of object-oriented middleware and markup languages. In this combination an object request broker implements reliable trade data transport. Markup languages, particularly XML, are used to address data integration problems. We show that the strengths of middleware and markup languages are complementary and discuss the benefits of deploying middleware and markup languages in a synergistic manner. 1 Introduction An increasing number of distributed systems are not built from scratch but rather integrate legacy systems or commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components. These components may not have been built to be integrated and are commonly heterogeneous. The heterogeneity may exhibit itself in the use of different programming languages, [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Customer {{relationship}} management (CRM) is {{not only}} {{one of the most important}} IT applications, but is also the key strategy to electronic commerce (EC) success. Some investigations in Taiwan show that CRM is the issue that enterprises care about the most, but are short of knowledge and professional support. Most CRM projects are highly fragmented and lack customer focus, and then they fail to meet their objectives. Embracing CRM requires architecture to conduct changes in many aspects. The banking industry is one of best beneficiaries of the CRM explosion in all sectors, but studies seldom explore it from an industry-specific perspective with action plans. This paper employs a four-strategic context to review the best practices of CRM in leading banks to puzzle out the CRM architecture, including contact channel management, enterprise-wide management on integrating and streamlining <b>front-office</b> and back-office <b>systems,</b> customer data management on implementing database and customer analysis, and information technology management. Taiwan’s banking industry can follow it to respond to the revealed internal and external challenges in this study, as well as to develop and examine its own CRM initiates. Hopefully, this study also benefits future researches into CRM readiness...|$|R
