5|$|Assuming {{genetic drift}} {{is the only}} {{evolutionary}} force acting on an allele, {{at any given time}} the probability that an allele will eventually become fixed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> is simply its frequency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> at that time. For example, if the frequency p for allele A is 75% and the frequency q for allele B is 25%, then given unlimited time the probability A will ultimately become fixed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> is 75% and the probability that B will become fixed is 25%.|$|E

5|$|Two main {{measures}} {{are used in}} epidemiological studies: incidence and prevalence.

5|$|A population's genetic {{variation}} can be greatly reduced by a bottleneck, and even beneficial adaptations may be permanently eliminated. The loss of variation leaves the surviving population vulnerable to any new selection pressures such as disease, climate change or {{shift in the}} available food source, because adapting in response to environmental changes requires sufficient {{genetic variation}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> for natural selection to take place.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the 2001 Census, 42% of the {{population}} identified themselves as being affiliated with the Church of Scotland, with 13% Roman Catholic and 28% with other Christian churches. Many of this last group belong to the Free Church of Scotland, known for its strict observance of the Sabbath. 11% stated that they had no religion. This made the Western Isles the Scottish council area with the smallest percentage of atheists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>population.</b> There are also small Episcopalian congregations in Lewis and Harris and the Outer Hebrides are part of the Diocese of Argyll and The Isles in both the Episcopalian and Catholic traditions.|$|E
5|$|Before mating, {{males and}} females may stridulate, or vibrate the objects they are on. In the Meloidae, the male climbs onto the dorsum of the female and strokes his {{antennae}} on her head, palps, and antennae. In Eupompha, the male draws his antennae along his longitudinal vertex. They may not mate at all {{if they do not}} perform the precopulatory ritual. This mating behaviour may be different amongst dispersed populations of the same species. For example, the mating of a Russian population of tansy beetle (Chysolina graminis) is preceded by an elaborate ritual involving the male tapping the female's eyes, pronotum and antennae with its antennae, which is not evident <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> of this species in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Christchurch {{was under}} heavy {{development}} at this time, {{as it had}} just been granted city status and was the new administrative capital of the province of Canterbury. This provided Mountfort and Luck ample opportunity to practice their trade. In 1855 they produced a preliminary design for the new Canterbury Provincial Council Buildings in timber. The buildings were constructed from 1857–59, but in a more limited form than the original design. As the Provincial Council gained new functions with growth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> and economy of the province, the buildings were enlarged with a North wing in stone and an iron clock tower from 1859–60, and further enlarged with a stone council chamber and refreshment rooms in 1864–65.

5|$|Construction of {{reservoirs}} for Liverpool Corporation in {{the mid-19th}} century led to a decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> when farms were cleared, the valley flooded and property {{in the western part}} of the village demolished.

5|$|Differences in the SFTPA1 gene {{sequence}} at {{the coding}} region determine SP-A genetic variants or haplotypes among individuals. More than 30 variants {{have been identified}} and characterized for SFTPA1 (and SFTPA2) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>population.</b> SFTPA1 variants result from nucleotide changes in the codons of amino acids 19, 50, 62, 133, and 219. Two of these do not modify the SP-A1 protein sequence (amino acids 62 and 133), whereas the rest result in amino acid substitutions (amino acid 19, 50, 133, and 219). Four SP-A1 variants (6A, 6A2, 6A3, 6A4) are in higher frequency in the general population. The most frequently found variant is 6A2.|$|E
