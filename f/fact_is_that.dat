5|$|If the Saxbe fix is a {{solution}} for the primary problem of self-dealing, a relevant <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Congress has not voted to increase any Cabinet salary or benefits since the 1990s, when it granted that power to {{the president in the}} form of an across-the-board cost of living adjustment by executive order. However, the Ineligibility Clause does not distinguish between increases in emoluments by legislation, and increases by executive order. Perhaps the most lenient interpretation of self-dealing was made during the 1973 Saxbe hearings by Duke University School of Law professor William Van Alstyne, who argued that the ineligibility clause only applied to new offices created during a congressional term, not to appointments to existing offices.|$|E
25|$|The indisputable <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{unemployment}} benefits, {{despite a}} web of regulations, actually serve to discourage some individuals from taking jobs, especially when the benefits extend across years.|$|E
25|$|Christians {{argue that}} the stone the {{builders}} rejected was Jesus himself. However, the <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Jesus {{was rejected by the}} tenants not by the builders.|$|E
50|$|Another {{interesting}} <b>fact</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Zephyr <b>was</b> built without couplers, so {{it could}} only operate as a single unit.|$|R
5000|$|Wills J. said [...] "the <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> ... <b>that</b> he {{infected}} her, {{and that}} from such infection she suffered grievous bodily harm".|$|R
60|$|Apparently he had succeeded, for {{he coughed}} no more after <b>that.</b> But the <b>fact</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> a hand had been gently laid upon his arm.|$|R
25|$|An {{important}} <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> minds perceive intramental states {{differently from}} sensory phenomena, and this cognitive difference results in {{mental and physical}} phenomena having seemingly disparate properties. The subjective argument holds that these properties are irreconcilable under a physical mind.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, the {{government}} decided {{to develop the}} island into a holiday resort for local visitors and tourists. A little discussed <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> many generations of Malays and Chinese who had lived harmoniously on the island were relocated into high-rise apartments on Singapore, the idyllic island life was lost and not by choice.|$|E
25|$|The teens, {{aware of}} the {{attention}} that their portrait recital their revered master, would go thereby heart, putting {{the best of their}} talent. Without thinking, they took a taste of the poetry, assimilated the prosody Arabic and, by corollary. The <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> many of these students have left good quality if not charming poems, mainly in Pular, the more productive has been Thierno Jawo Pellel.|$|E
60|$|The <b>fact</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> their {{conversation}} reflected {{not so much}} their own original ideas as a general wave of feeling <b>that</b> <b>was</b> passing over the whole community.|$|R
2500|$|It was {{reported}} in the Hanrei Jiho, vol. 355, p.17; translated in The Japanese Annual of International Law, vol. 8, 1964, p.231. <b>that</b> the <b>facts</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> ...|$|R
60|$|<b>That</b> <b>was</b> {{all very}} well in an {{abstract}} point of view; but the <b>fact</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> in practice, the more I didn't want to listen, the more I heard.|$|R
25|$|What Zaid {{means in}} <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he sought out verses from {{scattered}} sources, to collate {{them against the}} recollections of the huffaz. In this way everyone participated in the collection process. No one possessing any portion of it was left out, and so no one had reason for expressing concern about the verses collected, nor could anyone complain that the text had been gathered from only a select few.|$|E
25|$|The {{terminal}} building {{as well as}} the ancillary support facilities were buit and opened to service in 1986. This project also included the asphalt coated runway and built-in system of lights that provided visual descent guidance during runway approaches at night. The interesting <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the development of air traffic in Niš was not initiated just by Jat Airways, but also by Slovenian company Inex-Adria Airways (Adria Airways nowadays).|$|E
25|$|To {{get more}} bars and {{restaurants}} to become smoke-free without Qualified Establishment Exemptions. But the Hong Kong Administration, after taking years {{to bring in the}} anti-smoking legislation, immediately granted smoking deferral exemptions to any licensed restaurant or bar that applied for same – the exemptions remain valid until 1 July 2009. The ironic <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Health Department is the authority granting the smoking law exemptions whilst having to treat the results.|$|E
60|$|The <b>fact</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Florence had hurried {{her a good}} deal, because Mr. Wingfield was to {{show them}} the rosettes the horses were to wear on the wedding-day.|$|R
60|$|The <b>fact</b> <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> in the exhilaration {{of putting}} the hands on, he had {{forgotten}} that other and even more important operation, winding up. The watch had stopped.|$|R
60|$|The <b>fact</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> the {{announcement}} of Dorothea's changed condition caused no small disturbance within me, and I expressed it in the abrupt manner mentioned by young Blake.|$|R
25|$|In 1521 Luther was outlawed at the Diet of Worms. But the Reformation spread rapidly, {{helped by}} the Emperor Charles V's wars with France and the Turks. Hiding in the Wartburg Castle, Luther {{translated}} the Bible from Latin to German, establishing {{the basis of the}} German language. A curious <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Luther spoke a dialect which had minor importance in the German language of that time. After the publication of his Bible, his dialect suppressed the others and evolved into what is now the modern German.|$|E
25|$|To this remark, the Buddha {{tells them}} that the Brahmins have indeed {{forgotten}} about their past if they said such things. The <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the women in the}} Brahmin caste can get pregnant, give birth, and take care of their children. But the Brahmins still say that they are born from the Mouth of the God Brahma and other (castes) are born from Brahma's feet. Thus, the Brahmin's words are untrue. The Buddha said that the Brahmins are not speaking truthfully and they will reap a bad result from their own deeds.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} change of command directly affecting the forts {{took place on}} October 17, 1861, when Brigadier General Thomas F. Drayton {{was assigned to the}} Third Military District of the Department of South Carolina, which meant that the forts were in his jurisdiction. Drayton, {{who was a member of}} a prominent Charleston family and a graduate of the United States Military Academy, remained in command through the actions of November 7. Whether he could have hastened the preparations of the forts for battle is debatable; the <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he did not.|$|E
60|$|The actual <b>fact</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{the verses}} {{had been sent}} to him {{anonymously}} from a remote village in the Coast Range,--the address being the post-office and the signature initials.|$|R
6000|$|And the <b>fact</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> self-justification and {{carelessness}} of exact correctness {{of truth}} had brought all this upon her, and given her aunt this bad opinion of her friends! ...|$|R
60|$|The <b>fact</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> Mrs. Lillie, having {{formerly}} {{set down}} this lovely Charlie {{on the list}} of her own adorers, had small sympathy with the sentimental romance of her friend.|$|R
25|$|Although Pope Benedict XVI's second pallium was not {{actually}} made until 2008, {{the model for}} it already existed on his coat of arms. A scarcely known <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a precedent for Pope Benedict XVI's variations of the pallium was set in 1999 when Pope John Paul II wore a long Y-shaped pallium with red crosses for that year's Easter celebrations. It was only used that one time and was created by Piero Marini, the then Master of Pontifical Liturgical Celebrations, who would also create Pope Benedict's first pallium.|$|E
25|$|One {{intriguing}} <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{very few}} fish remains are found among their middens. This {{has led to}} much speculation and argument. Most archaeologists reject any decisive judgment based on this one fact, however, as fish bones decompose more quickly than other remains, {{and may have been}} disposed of in a different manner. Isotope analysis of the bones of inhabitants shows that marine food sources supplied {{more and more of the}} diet of the Norse Greenlanders, making up between 50% and 80% of their diet by the 14th century.|$|E
25|$|It {{may seem}} a vast {{depletion}} of the downtown shopping area, it now having only one department store, the Hudson's Bay Company. But the <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> for many years, until {{the arrival of the}} Hudson's Bay Company there were only two department stores downtown, Simpson's and the discount department store on Broad Street — the wholesale wing of Simpson's and Sherwood Department Store being outside city centre. Reaching a balance between convenience for residents of Regina and the desire to make the city appealing and impressive is not a novelty.|$|E
6000|$|The <b>fact</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{the mill}} owners were more {{difficult}} to get together in a body. A meeting would be arranged--"When you arrange a meeting, let me know," [...] said Antonelli.|$|R
50|$|Another {{interesting}} <b>fact</b> <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> {{even though}} he had defeated Garrincha in league games, he was so afraid of him during the 1962 World Cup he constantly asked where the attacker was.|$|R
5000|$|William II 'Rufus', King of England (1087-1100) - {{not in the}} {{traditional}} tomb associated with him, which may in <b>fact</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> of Henry of Blois, brother of King Stephen of England ...|$|R
25|$|Oddly enough, the Annals of Joseon Dynasty never {{mentions}} the map {{although it was}} obviously a national project. Another interesting <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this map uses the Ming Chinese era name Jianwen. After the Jianwen Emperor lost to Zhu Di in a civil war, the new emperor banned {{the use of the}} era name Jianwen in the 10th month of 1402. Thus the map should have used the era name Hongwu, not Jianwen. However, the era name Jianwen can be found even on the later Ryūkoku and Honkōji copies. This suggests that the Kangnido was never disclosed to the Chinese.|$|E
25|$|The first British {{synchronizer}} gear {{was built}} by the manufacturer of the machine-gun {{for which it was}} designed: it went into production in December 1915. George Challenger, the designer, was at the time an engineer at Vickers'. In principle it closely resembled the first form of the Fokker gear, although this was not because it was a copy (as is sometimes reported): it was not until April 1916 that a captured Fokker was available for technical analysis. The <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> both gears were based closely on the Saulnier patent. The first version was driven by a reduction gear attached to a rotary engine oil pump spindle, as in Saulnier's design; a small impulse-generating cam was mounted externally, on the port side of the forward fuselage, where it was readily accessible for adjustment.|$|E
25|$|Historians {{have long}} debated {{how and why}} many Bosnians {{converted}} to Islam. There is no simple answer to this question, and the underlying reasons are complex and numerous. One important <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Ottomans did not, as a rule, actively seek to convert their Christian subjects to Islam (the many generations it took for Bosnia to become predominantly Muslim and the retaining of Slavic customs among converts testify to this). The Ottoman Empire {{at the time was}} centered on militaristic expansion independent of religion, and the primary split was not between Muslims and nonbelievers but between the military-administrative class (the Ottomans) and various classes of serfs (known as rayah), neither of which was exclusive to any particular faith. Though the state eventually acquired a more Islamic focus, by this time, Muslims already made up a large majority of Bosnia's population.|$|E
6000|$|Amabel {{thought this}} so dogged and provoking, <b>that</b> she <b>was</b> out of patience; but Guy only laughed, and said, 'Rather so, {{considering}} <b>that</b> the <b>fact</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{we never thought}} of it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The <b>fact</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> a troop-ship having arrived rather suddenly, a {{sergeant}} had driven up in hot haste from the docks {{to make arrangements}} for the reception of the soldiers' wives and children! ...|$|R
60|$|Helen {{smiled in}} faint amusement. She {{was going to}} be sincere, but she meant to keep her word to the cowboy. The <b>fact</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{reflection}} had acquainted her with her indebtedness to Carmichael.|$|R
