5|$|De Materia Medica was {{circulated}} as illustrated manuscripts, copied by hand, in Greek, Latin and Arabic throughout the mediaeval period. From {{the sixteenth century}} on, Dioscorides' text was translated into Italian, German, Spanish, and French, and in 1655 into English. It {{formed the basis for}} herbals in these languages by men such as Leonhart Fuchs, Valerius Cordus, Lobelius, Rembert Dodoens, Carolus Clusius, John Gerard and William Turner. Gradually such herbals <b>included</b> <b>more</b> and more direct observations, supplementing and eventually supplanting the classical text.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Yugoslav Air Force {{inventory}} in April 1941 <b>included</b> <b>more</b> than 423 aircraft of Yugoslav, German, Italian, French, Czech and British design, {{in addition}} to 20 largely civilian transport aircraft which had been pressed into military service. Of these, 107 of the fighter aircraft were of modern design, the remainder were not capable of meeting front line Axis aircraft on close to equal terms, and were therefore considered obsolete. Some bomber and reconnaissance aircraft were also considered obsolete for the same reason.|$|E
5|$|A Kansas native, Isenhour {{attended}} the University of Kansas. She began her political {{career as a}} staffer in the Kansas House of Representatives. In 1990 {{she worked as a}} legislative aide to House Minority Leader Marvin Barkis, and the following year was an administrative assistant to House Majority Leader Donna Whiteman. From 1991 to 1995, Isenhour served as Chief of Staff to House Minority Leader Tom Sawyer, where she worked with Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike to advance legislation, served as a liaison between Sawyer and other officials, and worked with members of leadership and committees to develop legislative strategies and build coalitions. In 1992, Isenhour was the director of the Democratic Party's Kansas Coordinated Campaign for legislative races, both in the state House and Senate. Those races <b>included</b> <b>more</b> than three dozen candidates by July 1992.|$|E
5|$|A {{least one}} {{transportation}} {{study in the}} early 1970s identified the highway north of Novi as M-275. The Oakland County Road Commission, local land developers, and local politicians supported building a highway along the route of M-275 {{to open up the}} area for development. After the January 1977 cancelation of M-275 as a full freeway, the state explored building the highway as a parkway instead. This parkway concept allowed at-grade intersections that would have not been permitted had the highway been built as a full freeway, and <b>included</b> <b>more</b> landscaping and less grade separation. In September 1977, the State Transportation Commission ordered MDOT to study alternatives to a freeway in the area, along with the possible widening of I-94 and US23 and the improvement of local roads to handle increased traffic caused by the absence of an extended I-275 from the state's freeway network.|$|E

5|$|After the Cardiff Bay Opera House {{project was}} rejected, {{a new project}} was {{conceived}} that <b>included</b> <b>more</b> than opera and was felt {{to be a better}} reflection of Welsh culture. The change of name symbolised this, but the project still had to overcome many hurdles. Funding from the Welsh Assembly and Millennium Commission took years to obtain. Cardiff Council had to buy the land after the previous owners, Grosvenor Waterside (Associated British Ports property division) threatened to build a retail centre there due to the delays. Further boosts were given by large donations from South African businessman Donald Gordon and a loan from the international bank, HSBC. The GB£20million donation from Donald Gordon was split evenly between the Royal Opera House and Wales Millennium Centre and was spread over five years. This {{is believed to be the}} largest single private donation ever made to the arts in the UK.|$|E
5|$|During their sojourn at Nassau, the Fly arrived. Her captain {{reported}} that she and the Hornet had fouled their riggings together and that Hornet suffered significant damage as a consequence. On March 17, the fleet sailed for Block Island Channel off Newport, Rhode Island, with Browne and other officials as prisoners. The return voyage was uneventful until the fleet reached the waters of Long Island. On April 4, they encountered and captured HMS Hawk, {{and the next day}} captured the Bolton, which was laden with stores that <b>included</b> <b>more</b> armaments and powder. The fleet finally met resistance on April 6, when it encountered the HMS Glasgow, a sixth-rate ship. In the ensuing action, the outnumbered Glasgow managed to escape capture, severely damaging the Cabot in the process, wounding her captain, Hopkins' son John Burroughs Hopkins, and killing or wounding eleven others.|$|E
5|$|Following Williams's {{death in}} 1996, curator Roslyn Walker, served as {{director}} from 1997 through her 2002 retirement. Walker continued {{the direction of}} her predecessor and added a dedicated contemporary art gallery and curator. She also created a development office, which raised money for an early 2000s renovation of the museum's pavilion. Sharon Patton, former director of Oberlin College's Allen Memorial Art Museum, served as director between 2003 and 2008.

An unpaid position, his local church leadership often took 30 or more hours a week of his time, and he became known for his considerable energy in the role. He also earned a reputation for avoiding any overnight travel that might interfere with his church responsibilities.|$|E
5|$|Geetha Arts {{released}} the film on 31 July 2009, with 625 digital UFO prints in 1250 theatres across the globe, making Magadheera the biggest release for a Telugu film in history.

Magadheera {{was the first}} Telugu film to be released on 21 screens in North America. Huge vinyl posters featuring Ram Charan and his father, cameo performer Chiranjeevi, were put up {{at all of the}} theatres in Krishna District. Posters also featured the head of Chiranjeevi's political party, former MLA Vangaveeti Radhakrishna, which added political importance to the release. The Tamil dubbed version Maaveeran and Malayalam dubbed version Dheera—The Warrior were released in more than 100 screens and 50 screens respectively on 27 May 2011.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Sukhoi {{developed}} {{an updated version}} of the Su-33; flight trials began in October 2010. This modernised Su-33 was to compete with a potential Chinese indigenous version of the original Su-33, and to encourage orders from the Russian Navy. Major upgrades to the aircraft <b>included</b> <b>more</b> powerful (132kN, 29,800lbf) AL-31-F-M1 engines and a larger weapons carriage; upgrades to the radar and weapons were not possible at the time due to funding constraints. According to military author Richard Fisher, it has been speculated that further modifications to a new production batch would include a phased-array radar, thrust-vectoring nozzles, and long-range anti-ship missiles.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Clinton made {{reform of the}} Arkansas {{education}} system a top priority of his gubernatorial administration. The Arkansas Education Standards Committee was chaired by Clinton's wife Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was also an attorney {{as well as the}} chair of the Legal Services Corporation. The committee transformed Arkansas's education system. Proposed reforms <b>included</b> <b>more</b> spending for schools (supported by a sales-tax increase), better opportunities for gifted children, vocational education, higher teachers' salaries, more course variety, and compulsory teacher competency exams. The reforms passed in September 1983 after Clinton called a special legislative session—the longest in Arkansas history. Many have considered this the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship. He defeated four Republican candidates for governor: Lowe (1978), White (1982 and 1986), Jonesboro businessmen Woody Freeman (1984), and Sheffield Nelson of Little Rock (1990).|$|E
5|$|Many {{aspects of}} the {{gameplay}} were reworked for this sequel. Some changes were made due to user feedback and others {{were meant to be}} included in previous games but were omitted either because of time or technological constraints. The camera was switched to the right analog stick of the DualShock controller instead of the shoulder buttons and the Gummi Ship travel was reworked. The combat system was completely redone and did not use any animations from the first game. Because Sora had matured, Nomura wanted his fighting style to reflect that. Other changes <b>included</b> <b>more</b> integration between exploration and battles. The variations in combat styles associated with each Drive Form and the introduction of the Reaction Command were added to give players more choices in battles. The inclusion of worlds based on live-action Disney films was aided by technology that generated the character models from live-action pictures.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Vietnamese defence {{personnel}} were concentrated {{at the eastern}} gate of the citadel, where they stubbornly fought off the French. Rigault de Genouilly led 500 French troops in hand-to-hand combat for seven hours, having used explosives to breach the citadel. At 14:00, the French seized control of the citadel. Two hours later, de Genouilly declared the citadel as the new general headquarters of the French forces. The French seized a large arsenal. This <b>included</b> <b>more</b> than 200 cannons, 20,000 hand-held weapons such as firearms, pistols and swords, 100 tons of munitions, 80,000 tons of rice and 130,000 francs in cash. Saltpetre, shot and sulphur were also seized. The Vietnamese material losses were estimated to be around 20 million francs.
