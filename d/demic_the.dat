40|$|Two {{alternative}} {{models have}} been proposed to explain the spread of agriculture in Europe during the Neolithic period. <b>The</b> <b>demic</b> diffusion model postulates the spreading of farmers from the Middle East along a Southeast to Northeast axis. Conversely, the cultural diffusion model assumes transmission of agricultural techniques without substantial movements of people. Support for <b>the</b> <b>demic</b> model derives largely from the observation of frequency gradients among some genetic variants, in particular haplogroups defined by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Y-chromosome. A recent network analysis of the R-M 269 Y chromosome lineage has purportedly corroborated Neolithic expansion from Anatolia, the site of diffusion of agriculture. However, the data are still controversial and the analyses so far performed are prone {{to a number of}} biases. In the present study we show that the addition of a single marker, DYSA 7. 2, dramatically changes the shape of the R-M 269 network into a topology showing a clear Western-Eastern dichotomy not consistent with a radial diffusion of people from the Middle East. We have also assessed other Y-chromosome haplogroups proposed to be markers of the Neolithic diffusion of farmers and compared their intra-lineage variation [...] defined by short tandem repeats (STRs) [...] in Anatolia and in Sardinia, the only Western population where these lineages are present at appreciable frequencies and where there is substantial archaeological and genetic evidence of pre-Neolithic human occupation. The data indicate that Sardinia does not contain a subset of the variability present in Anatolia and that the shared variability between these populations is best explained by an earlier, pre-Neolithic dispersal of haplogroups from a common ancestral gene pool. Overall, these results are consistent with the cultural diffusion and do not support <b>the</b> <b>demic</b> model of agriculture diffusion...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{different}} models of diffusion- demic and cultural- {{have been proposed}} as {{an explanation for the}} spread of languages. Recent studies have shown that in some cases the dispersal of the language was due to <b>the</b> <b>demic</b> diffusion while for others it is purely due to the process of acculturation. There are four major linguistic families in India which have largely their own geographic domain. However, there are a few situations in which the populations affiliated to different linguistic families cohabit. For example, we find the spread of the Indo-European and Dravidian tribal populations in the core/peripheral areas of the Mundari Austro-Asiatic groups. These non-Mundari groups have been termed as transitional populations to indicate that these populations originally were probably Mundaris. However, there has been no attempt to ascertain if these populations are genetically Austro-Asiatics or do they belong to the linguistic groups that they are currently affiliated to. To examine this we have analysed Y-SNPs and STRs data of the 13 Mundari and 7 transitional groups and compared with the other populations of relevant linguistic groups. The results suggest that the Indo-European transitional groups are genetically Mundari and have acquired the present language through the process of cultural diffusion, while in the case of Dravidian transitional groups, the spread of language seems to be due to the process of both, <b>the</b> <b>demic</b> and cultural diffusion...|$|R
40|$|The Neolithic {{transition}} is {{the shift from}} hunting-gathering into farming. About 9000 years ago, the Neolithic transition began to spread from the Near East into Europe, until it reached Northern Europe about 5500 years ago. There are two main models of this spread. <b>The</b> <b>demic</b> model assumes that it was mainly due to the reproduction and dispersal of farmers. The cultural model assumes that European hunter-gatherers become farmers by acquiring domestic plants and animals, aswell as knowledge, from neighbouring farmers. Here we use the dates of about 900 archaeological sites to compute a speed map of {{the spread of the}} Neolithic transition in Europe. We compare the speed map to the speed ranges predicted by purely demic, demic-cultural and purely cultural models. The comparison indicates that the transition was cultural in Northern Europe, the Alpine region and west of the Black Sea. But demic diffusion was at work in other regions such as the Balkans and Central Europe. Our models can be applied to many other cultural traits. We also propose that genetic data could be gathered and used to measure <b>the</b> <b>demic</b> kernels of Early Neolithic populations.
