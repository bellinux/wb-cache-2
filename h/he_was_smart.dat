500|$|In 1936, Feller {{was signed}} by Cy Slapnicka, a scout for the Indians, for one dollar and an autographed baseball. While {{scouting}} Feller, Slapnicka said, [...] "This was a kid pitcher I had to get. I knew he was something special. His fastball was fast and fuzzy; it didn't go in a straight line; it would wiggle and shoot around. I didn't know then that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>smart</b> and had {{the heart of a}} lion, but I knew that I was looking at an arm the likes of which you see only once in a lifetime." [...] Feller was assigned to the Fargo-Moorhead Twins and was to report there after finishing the high school semester. Slapnicka was later named general manager of the Indians and transferred Feller's contract from Fargo-Moorhead to the New Orleans Pelicans. He was planning to add Feller, along with outfielder Tommy Henrich, to the major league roster after a few exhibition and semi-pro games without visiting either farm club. By doing so, the Indians would be in violation of Major League Baseball's rule stating that, at the time, only minor league teams could sign amateur baseball players to contracts. After a three-month investigation, concluding in December 1936, about whether the Indians broke any Major League Baseball rules by signing Feller, Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis disagreed with the argument presented by Slapnicka and Indians president Alva Bradley, but awarded both Feller and Henrich free agency and required the club to pay a $7,500 fine. Landis made the decision partly due to the testimony of Feller and his father, who wanted his son to play for Cleveland and who had also told Landis he would take the issue to court. Feller elected to remain with the Indians but Henrich joined the New York Yankees. Sports columnist Joe Williams wrote, [...] "For $7500 the Cleveland Indians received $500,000 worth of publicity. ... I feel pretty sure Mr. Alva Bradley, president of the Indians, will admit this is the cheapest investment he ever made in publicity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Of the {{two names}} put forward, Talleyrand was the less {{undesirable}} choice. [...] <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>smart,</b> {{he had studied}} the law, {{and he was a}} relative by marriage of the Pope. [...] This may also explain the Pope's indulgence in allowing Talleyrand to keep the diocese of Auxerre until 22 July 1332, to finance his move to Avignon.|$|E
2500|$|E. Urner Goodman {{also wrote}} the Owasippe Hymn {{that would become}} the Reservation's song that is sung {{at the end of}} all opening and closing campfires by the staff. The {{original}} lyrics written in 1927 by Dr. Goodman remain in the museum. According to a now older staff alumni, Joseph Sener, he stood with Sheridan Nunn at the shore of the current location of the Blackhawk Fire-bowl during Camp Blackhawk's relocation and Nunn said, [...] "it was here at this spot in 1927 that I sat with E. Urner Goodman as he wrote out the lyrics to the Owasippe Hymn". Sener recounts how when he heard that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>smart</b> enough to know how amazing and important that was.|$|E

2500|$|Skilling {{graduated}} from West Aurora High School. He received {{a full scholarship}} to Southern Methodist University in Dallas {{where he was a}} member of the Beta Theta Pi Fraternity. He initially studied engineering before changing to business. After graduation, he went to work for a Houston bank, which sent him to Harvard Business School. He stated that during his admissions interview for Harvard Business School, he was asked if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>smart,</b> to which he replied, [...] "I'm fucking smart." [...] Skilling earned his M.B.A. from Harvard Business School during 1979, graduating in the top 5% of his class as a Baker Scholar. He became a consultant at McKinsey & Company in the energy and chemical consulting practices. Skilling became one of the youngest partners in the history of McKinsey.|$|E
2500|$|Bruce Johnston {{explains}} that [...] "Brian really worked {{a lot on}} 'God Only Knows', and at one point, {{he had all the}} Beach Boys, Terry Melcher and two of the Rovell sisters [...] on it. It just got so overloaded; it was nuts. So <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>smart</b> enough to peel it all back, and he held voices back to the bridge, me at the top end, Carl in the middle and Brian on the bottom. At that point, Brian's right move was to get subtler. He had a very tender track here. 'God Only Knows' is a very small masterpiece with a major heartbeat, and he was right to peel everybody back and wind up with the three parts. In fact, it's probably the only well-known Beach Boys track that has just three voices on it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Turner was big for his day ( [...] , [...] ); however, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>smart</b> {{and very}} fast. Turner later boasted about his talent as a blocker: [...] "I {{was such a}} good blocker, that the men they put in front of me – and some were stars who were {{supposed}} to be making a lot of tackles – they would have their coaches saying, 'why ain't you making any tackles?' they'd say, 'that bum Turner is holding.' Well that wasn't true[...] [...] [...] I could handle anybody that they'd put in front of me." [...] According to George Halas, Turner was [...] "perhaps the smartest player" [...] he had in 40 years as the Bears' coach, a player who [...] "knew every assignment for every player on every player." [...] Teammate George Musso once said of Turner, [...] "Who knows what kind of player he would have been if he ever got to rest during a game?" ...|$|E

2500|$|After being {{admitted}} to the bar, Dershowitz served as a clerk for David L. Bazelon, the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. He said that [...] "Bazelon was my best and worst boss at once ... He worked me to the bone; he didn't hesitate to call at 2a.m. He taught me everything—how to be a civil libertarian, a Jewish activist, a mensch. He was halfway between a slave master and a father figure." [...] During the 1963–1964 term, he served as law clerk for the Supreme Court Associate Justice Arthur Goldberg. He told Tom Van Riper of Forbes that getting a Supreme Court clerkship was probably his second big break; his first was when, at age 14 or 15, a camp counselor told him <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>smart</b> but that his mind operated a little differently. He joined the faculty of Harvard Law School as {{an assistant professor in}} 1964, and was made a full professor in 1967 at the age of 28, at that time the youngest full professor of law in the school's history. He was appointed Felix Frankfurter professor of law in 1993.|$|E
2500|$|In 1971 after Wozniak began {{attending}} University of California, Berkeley, Jobs {{would visit}} him {{there a few}} times a week. This experience led him to study in nearby Stanford University's student union. Jobs also decided that rather than join the electronics club, he would put on light shows with a friend for Homestead's avant-garde Jazz program. He was described by a Homestead classmate as [...] "kind of a brain and kind of a hippie ... but he never fit into either group. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>smart</b> enough to be a nerd, but wasn't nerdy. And he was too intellectual for the hippies, who just wanted to get wasted all the time. He was kind of an outsider. In high school everything revolved around what group you were in. and if you weren't in a carefully defined group, you weren't anybody. He was an individual, in a world where individuality was suspect." [...] By his senior year in late 1971, he was taking freshman English class at Stanford and working on a Homestead underground film project with Chrisann. In mid-1972, after graduation and before leaving for Reed College, Jobs and Brennan rented a house from their other roommate, Al. During the summer, Brennan, Jobs, and Steve Wozniak found an advertisement posted on the De Anza College bulletin board for a job that required people to dress up as characters from Alice in Wonderland. Brennan portrayed Alice while Wozniak, Jobs, and Al portrayed the White Rabbit and the Mad Hatter.|$|E
