5|$|The {{increasing}} <b>irrelevance</b> of the Holy Alliance after 1825 and {{the fall}} of the Bourbon dynasty in France in 1830 during the July Revolution eliminated the principal support of Ferdinand VII in Europe, {{but it was not until}} the king's death in 1833 that Spain finally abandoned all plans of military reconquest, and in 1836 its government went so far as to renounce sovereignty over all of continental America. During the course of the 19th century, Spain would recognize each of the new states. Only Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule, until the Spanish–American War in 1898.|$|E
5|$|The victim, as {{presented}} by Goya, is as anonymous as his killers. His entreaty is addressed not to God {{in the manner}} of traditional painting, but to an unheeding and impersonal firing squad. He is not granted the heroism of individuality, but is merely part of a continuum of victims. Beneath him lies a bloody and disfigured corpse; behind and around him are others who will soon share the same fate. Here, for the first time, according to biographer Fred Licht, nobility in individual martyrdom is replaced by futility and <b>irrelevance,</b> the victimization of mass murder, and anonymity as a hallmark of the modern condition.|$|E
5|$|Bormann's {{power and}} {{effective}} reach broadened considerably during the war. By early 1943, the war produced a labour crisis for the regime. Hitler created a three-man committee {{with representatives of}} the State, the army, and the Party in an attempt to centralise control of the war economy. The committee members were Hans Lammers (head of the Reich Chancellery), Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, chief of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Armed Forces High Command; OKW), and Bormann, who controlled the Party. The committee was intended to independently propose measures regardless of the wishes of various ministries, with Hitler reserving most final decisions to himself. The committee, soon known as the Dreierausschuß (Committee of Three), met eleven times between January and August 1943. However, they ran up against resistance from Hitler's cabinet ministers, who headed deeply entrenched spheres of influence and were excluded from the committee. Seeing it as a threat to their power, Goebbels, Göring, and Speer worked together to bring it down. The result was that nothing changed, and the Committee of Three declined into <b>irrelevance.</b>|$|E

He also criticized the ruling party of the state for inaction and the local BJP leaders for seeking to defending the attackers.|$|E
25|$|The club's {{earliest}} rivalry {{was with}} VFL powerhouse the Hawthorn Hawks. This rivalry {{stemmed from a}} series of memorable matches in the early 1990s, most notably the 1991 Grand Final. It was considered the first ever interstate rivalry in the competition, although it had fallen to <b>irrelevance</b> in later years. 24 years later in 2015, the two clubs would meet again in another Grand Final.|$|E
25|$|Another approach, which favours {{specific}} predicates over others, {{was taken}} by Hintikka. Hintikka was motivated to find a Bayesian approach to the paradox that did not make use {{of knowledge about the}} relative frequencies of ravens and black things. Arguments concerning relative frequencies, he contends, cannot always account for the perceived <b>irrelevance</b> of evidence consisting of observations of objects of type A for the purposes of learning about objects of type not-A.|$|E
25|$|But {{history was}} against Bayern. The {{advent of the}} Hitler regime saw President Landauer, a Jew, resigning quickly, and the team visiting him in his Swiss exile did not help their {{fortunes}} in the new era. Dombi, also a Jew, moved to the Netherlands, where {{he picked up the}} reins of SC Feijenoord in Rotterdam, laying the foundations for the future greatness of the club. In the ensuing years, the club decayed into <b>irrelevance,</b> disliked by the Nazis for its Jewish background and taunted as Judenklub.|$|E
25|$|But school {{counseling}} in the 1980s and early 1990s was absent from educational reform efforts. The profession was facing <b>irrelevance</b> as the standards-based educational movement gained strength with {{little evidence of}} systemic effectiveness for school counselors. In response, consulted with elementary, middle, and high school counselors and created the ASCA Student Standards with three core domains (Academic, Career, Personal/Social), nine standards, and specific competencies and indicators for K-12 students. A year later, the first systemic meta-analysis of {{school counseling}} was published focused on outcome research in academic, career, and personal/social domains.|$|E
25|$|The {{measures}} to expand admissibility of bad character evidence were also opposed {{on the grounds}} of unfairness (the defendant's past bad character can more easily be adduced than a witness's) and of dangerous <b>irrelevance.</b> The measures reforming hearsay, which were more closely modelled on the Law Commission's report than the other reforms, attracted less adverse attention, though the Bar Council disputed some of its aspects. The maximum period a suspected terrorist could be detained without charge was increased from 7 to 14 days. This was later increased to 28 days by the Terrorism Act 2006.|$|E
25|$|This came in May 1989, when he {{was called}} up to play against Nottinghamshire in the County Championship, usual keeper Steve Rhodes having been {{selected}} to make his One Day International debut. He dismissed only two batsmen (Michael Newell and Chris Broad), and scored very few runs (6 not out), but in the continuing absence of Rhodes he was retained for the following match against Gloucestershire. Again Bevins was generally tidy but unspectacular behind the stumps, but again his batting was almost an <b>irrelevance.</b> He also made his maiden one-day appearance in the Refuge Assurance League.|$|E
25|$|The commandos are {{a regular}} {{feature in the}} SAF's major parades and events, such as the annual Singapore Armed Forces Military Tattoo and the Singapore Armed Forces Day Parade. They also appear in various {{national}} events, including the National Day Parade, where they form {{one of the four}} guard of honour contingents after winning the Best Combat Unit awards in the preceding year. They have appeared in various mass display segments, often by displaying their rappelling skills. The commandos have also served as the guard of honour for important visitors to the Istana, but they are increasingly replaced by the Military Police due to the <b>irrelevance</b> of the task to their official duties.|$|E
25|$|For an {{overview}} {{on the different}} perspectives concerning optimal balance {{between public and private}} power in the economy, see liberal, realist & Marxist. For more detail on specific systems of thought relevant to debate on this fiscal policy see Keynesian economics, Monetarism, the Austrian School, New classical macroeconomics, Real business-cycle theory, and New Keynesian economics. A key common feature of the anti-Keynesian schools of thought is that they argued for policy ineffectiveness or policy <b>irrelevance.</b> Although the theoretical justifications vary, the various schools all hold that government intervention will be much less effective than Keynes had believed, with some advocates even claiming {{that in the long run}} interventionist policy will always be counterproductive.|$|E
25|$|A third view, {{presented}} {{in a number of}} recent evaluations, is that Jutland, the last major fleet action between battleships, illustrated the <b>irrelevance</b> of battleship fleets following the development of the submarine, mine and torpedo. In this view, the most important consequence of Jutland was the decision of the Germans to engage in unrestricted submarine warfare. Although large numbers of battleships were constructed in the decades between the wars, {{it has been argued that}} this outcome reflected the social dominance among naval decision-makers of battleship advocates who constrained technological choices to fit traditional paradigms of fleet action. Battleships played a relatively minor role in World War II, in which the submarine and aircraft carrier emerged as the dominant offensive weapons of naval warfare.|$|E
25|$|When Kline joined Mackay, Australia were 207-9 and {{appeared}} doomed, {{for there was}} still one hour and fifty minutes playing time remaining. Only two minutes later, Sobers, fielding only four yards from the bat, appealed confidently for a catch from Mackay off Worrell, but Egar ruled {{that it was not}} out. In one of the great rearguard actions, the pair proceeded to play out the remaining time. Mackay was a capable batsman but Kline was a bowler and less used to being asked to make a long stand at the crease. In his thirteen Tests Kline never exceeded the 15 not out that he made on this occasion. Mackay's 62 not out occupied 223 balls, and Kline's score was made from 109. Their unbroken last wicket stand added 66, though the runs were almost an <b>irrelevance.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} team spent the mid-to-late 20th century near complete <b>irrelevance</b> {{in both the}} international game and the domestic sporting scene. For the World Cup qualifications, {{there was only one}} berth for CONCACAF during this period until 1982. The emergence of the North American Soccer League in the 1960s and 1970s raised hopes that the U.S. {{national team}} would soon improve and become a global force. However such hopes were not realized and by the 1980s the U.S. Soccer Federation found itself in serious financial struggles, with the national team playing only two matches from 1981 to 1983. U.S. Soccer targeted the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and the 1986 World Cup as means of rebuilding the national team and its fan base. The International Olympic Committee declared that teams from outside Europe and South America could field full senior teams, including professionals, that had never played in a World Cup. U.S. Soccer rearranged its Olympic roster, cutting many collegiate players and replacing them with professionals, but the U.S. finished 1–1–1 and failed to make the second round.|$|E
500|$|Ratings for {{the episode}} {{fell from the}} season premiere, but were still {{stronger}} than the fourth season average. [...] "Tea Leaves" [...] received 2.9 million overall viewers and a 1.0 in the coveted 18-49 demographic. The episode received enthusiastic response from television critics. The main theme of the episode was seen by many television writers as the growing generation gap, and the increasing <b>irrelevance</b> of the main characters in culture and business as a result.|$|E
500|$|Allen {{was capable}} of bowling unusually quickly. Critics judged him to have an {{excellent}} bowling action, through which he achieved his pace. He bowled from sideways on, and according to his Wisden obituary, had [...] "a rhythmical run-up and full follow-through". R. C. Robertson-Glasgow described Allen in 1943: [...] "Of no more than medium height, he has a solid yet elastic strength, every unit of which {{is used in the}} delivery and in a follow-through which is the finest I have ever seen." [...] Robertson-Glasgow continued: [...] "His bowling, though it varies from piercing accuracy to almost ludicrous <b>irrelevance,</b> has often touched greatness." [...] Although opposed to Bodyline tactics in Australia, Allen often bowled short to intimidate batsmen in county cricket—for example, he once struck Wyatt over the heart with a fast ball.|$|E
500|$|In the past, McEwen's {{ambition}} {{has taken}} the form of interest in higher office. Twice he made feints about seeking statewide office. But he didn't want to risk his congressional seat. Now he's {{found a way to}} nurse a healthy level of ambition without taking that risk. He has, of course, a pronounced tendency to be wrong about the issues... Most typically, he appears as an ideological combatant. He seems to be selling himself to the nation's conservatives as an attractive spokesman. He's got enough talent to do it. In the days when McEwen was content to be a back-bencher, he was criticized on this page for his <b>irrelevance</b> on the important issues. Now, however, {{it is clear that the}} nation as a whole was better off when he was keeping his views to himself.|$|E
500|$|A British view of Abd al-Rahman at {{this time}} was given by Sir Stewart Symes, writing in April 1935, [...] "He has the defects of a Sudanese of his type, the liking of intrigue, vanity, <b>irrelevance</b> and opportunism. On the other hand, he has quick perceptions, panache and subtle {{tenacity}} of purpose... He has used [...] the opportunities ... of laying the foundations of his Mahdist organization in the provinces... His favorite role {{is that of the}} loyal supporter of Government who is maliciously misunderstood". Symes refused to take action to suppress neo-Mahdism, preferring to follow a policy of ensuring that Abd al-Rahman conformed to agreed guidelines of behavior, with the implied threat of punishment if he broke these rules. He allowed some restrictions to be lifted, while retaining others.|$|E
500|$|This {{led to a}} {{widespread}} public perception that the CMF was a refuge for [...] "draft dodgers", and {{to the creation of}} an organisation in which the majority of its members had little or no motivation to fulfil their training obligations. Although this was not a universal experience, overall it affected the morale of the CMF and, coupled with the decision by the government not to activate CMF units for service in Vietnam, this led to a decline in genuine voluntary enlistment. To a large extent also, the government's decision to not use the CMF during this time highlighted the organisation's increasing structural <b>irrelevance,</b> and questions about the role that the CMF had to play in the defence of Australia would remain until following the end of the Vietnam War. Meanwhile, the last CMF armoured regiment gave up its tanks in 1971.|$|E
500|$|T. A. Frank of The New Republic {{says that}} in season 1 she is {{completely}} ignored {{by the president and}} dismissed by Congress as she endures repeated indignities {{with a high degree of}} cynicism. According to Frank, Meyer slowly gains some respect and power, but it is not without effort. Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker, noted that the premise of a politician without influence striving for it suited itself well to a comedy and that her frequent cursing should not have been much of an issue given that it was an HBO production. Laura Bennett of The New Republic states that in season 1 Meyer is [...] "a hapless buffoon, fluffing her hair and running in circles", who endures marginalization and <b>irrelevance,</b> but in season 2, which is set during midterm elections, she is [...] "a player in the administration with concrete involvement in foreign policy".|$|E
500|$|Doppelgänger {{is given}} a rating of two-and-a-half stars out of five in a {{negative}} review published on the Film4 website, which praises the effects work and costume design but criticises the scenes with the character of Dr Hassler for their <b>irrelevance</b> to the main plot, and the subtext of the Rosses' troubled marriage as an unnecessary diversion from the narrative. Although Ross and Kane's mission through space {{is described as a}} [...] "brief, trippy light show", the review questions the originality of having a parallel Earth as the focus, and the depth of the script's vision: [...] "Anderson's has to be the cheapest alternate Earth ever. Whereas audiences might expect a world where the Roman Empire never fell or the Nazis won World War II, here the shocking discovery is that people write backwards. That's it." [...] Doppelgänger is only recommended for fans of the Anderson productions, and is considered [...] "an occasionally interesting failure".|$|E
500|$|Germany {{withdrew from}} the League of Nations and the World Disarmament Conference in October 1933. In January 1935, over 90 {{percent of the people}} of the Saarland, then under League of Nations administration, voted to unite with Germany. That March, Hitler {{announced}} an expansion of the Wehrmacht to 600,000 members—six times the number permitted by the Versailles Treaty—including development of an air force (Luftwaffe) and an increase in the size of the navy (Kriegsmarine). Britain, France, Italy, and the League of Nations condemned these violations of the Treaty, but did nothing to stop it. The Anglo-German Naval Agreement (AGNA) of 18 June allowed German tonnage to increase to 35 percent of that of the British navy. Hitler called the signing of the AGNA [...] "the happiest day of his life", believing that the agreement marked the beginning of the Anglo-German alliance he had predicted in Mein Kampf. France and Italy were not consulted before the signing, directly undermining the League of Nations and setting the Treaty of Versailles on the path towards <b>irrelevance.</b>|$|E
500|$|Jay Carr of The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "Boys Don't Cry {{not only}} revisits the crime, but convinces us we're being taken inside it". Stephanie Zacharek of Salon gave a {{positive}} review, singling out the directing and acting. She wrote, [...] "Peirce ... covers an {{extraordinary amount of}} territory, not just in terms of dealing with Brandon’s sexual-identity and self-fulfillment issues, but also in trying to understand the lives of those around him". Zacharek described Swank's performance as [...] "a continual revelation" [...] and Sevigny's performance as [...] "transformative". She said, [...] "When Brandon dies, [...] "Boys Don’t Cry" [...] reaches an emotional intensity that’s almost operatic. The saddest thing, though, is seeing Sevigny’s Lana crumpled over his corpse—the way she plays it, you know that when Brandon went, he took a part of her with him, too". David Edelstein of Slate was also very positive towards the film, calling it [...] "a meditation on the <b>irrelevance</b> of gender." [...] He went on to praise Swank, Sevigny, and Sarsgaard in their roles, especially Sevigny, writing that she [...] "keeps the movie tantalizing".|$|E
500|$|With {{the growth}} of the {{doctrine}} of parliamentary sovereignty, Coke's theory gradually died out; William Blackstone, in the first edition of his Commentaries on the Laws of England, wrote that [...] "if the parliament will positively enact a thing to be done which is unreasonable, I know of no power that can control it: and the examples alleged in support of this sense of the rule do none of them prove, that where the main object of a statute is unreasonable the judges are at liberty to reject it; for that were to set the judicial power above that of the legislature, which would be subversive of all government". Parliamentary sovereignty is now upheld by the English judiciary as a [...] "central principle of British constitutionalism" [...] despite with some issues by membership in the European Union. The case's modern <b>irrelevance</b> is such that Philip Hamburger wrote in 2008, [...] "Bonham's Case scarcely deserves mention in a history of judicial duty, except for reasons that are now largely forgotten".|$|E
500|$|The kiss between Mulder and Scully {{caused a}} furor of opinions. The Complete X-Files noted that many fans were [...] "ecstatic" [...] about Mulder and Scully's [...] "long-awaited" [...] kiss. David Blar from DVD Talk called the episode [...] "shocking" [...] because of Mulder and Scully's kiss, asking, [...] "why they didn't lock lips sooner"? Paula Vitaris {{noted that the}} kiss [...] "seems stuck on to the episode by a tack in its {{complete}} <b>irrelevance</b> to the storyline or Mulder and Scully in general." [...] Allan Johnson from the Chicago Tribune noted that [...] "in a way, it's too bad Sunday's episode of Fox's The X-Files is getting more attention for what happens near the end than it does for its plot." [...] Kessenich praised the way the show worked in Mulder and Scully's kiss, noting that its lack of a [...] "steamy, rip your clothes off" [...] atmosphere made the sequence work [...] "so well". Handlen wrote that the scene, coupled with Black getting his daughter back, was [...] "the only scene which comes close to justifying the episode’s existence". Furthermore, he enjoyed the ambiguous nature of the kiss, noting {{that it could be}} [...] "just a one time thing, or maybe it’s the start of something, or maybe it’s just a continuation of something that’s {{been going on for a}} long time now, right under our noses." ...|$|E
500|$|Journalists {{reviewing}} the match praised Arsenal’s young team; some however {{went as far}} to criticise their conduct in the brawl. Henry Winter wrote in The Daily Telegraph of 26 February 2007 [...] "…all feline grace and youthful ambition, [...] were the better team, moving the ball around exquisitely at times," [...] while Glenn Moore of The Independent reflected [...] "the Arsenal manager can take great consolation from {{the quality of his}} young footballers." [...] The Guardian correspondent Kevin McCarra opened his match report with the line [...] "To Chelsea the trophy, to Arsenal the future," [...] and felt the latter club deserved plaudits for the role they played in the final, and competition as a whole. He commended Chelsea’s adversity and singled out Carvalho as an example; at fault for Arsenal’s goal, the defender’s performance thereafter was faultless. Matt Dickinson of The Times agreed that Arsenal had played the better football, but said their temperament was [...] "brittle" [...] – [...] " [...] had lost the trophy before they lost their heads." [...] Football pundit Alan Hansen was scathing of Arsenal’s behaviour and suggested their inexperience had a part to play: “When they reflect upon it, Arsenal will admit that they were largely in the wrong." [...] He was critical of Wenger’s team selection and felt the big clubs saw the competition, much like the FA Cup as an <b>irrelevance.</b> The violence and sendings off on the pitch led to some media outlets dubbing the match as the [...] "Snarling Cup Final", {{or in the case of}} Winter's match report the [...] "Carnage Cup final".|$|E
500|$|The novel {{met with}} [...] "a crackle of {{favorable}} reviews in major papers". The New Republic hailed it as [...] "an exceptional work", both [...] "thoughtful and irrepressibly imaginative". The Houston Chronicle described Clarke as [...] "a superb character writer", and the Denver Post {{called her a}} [...] "superb storyteller". The reviews praised Clarke's [...] "deft" [...] handling of the pastiche of styles, but many criticised the novel's pace, The Guardian complaining that [...] "the plot creaks frightfully in many places and the pace dawdles". In his review for Science Fiction Weekly, Clute suggested that [...] "almost every scene in the first 300 pages should have been carefully and delicately trimmed" [...] (emphasis in original) since they do little to advance the story. He argued that, at times, Clarke's Austenesque tone {{gets in the way}} of plot development. On the other hand, The Baltimore Sun found the novel [...] "a quick read". Complaining that the book leaves the reader [...] "longing for just a bit more lyricism and poetry", The Washington Post reviewer noted, with others, that [...] "sex plays virtually no role in the story... one looks in vain for the corruption of the innocent". The New Statesman reviewer, Amanda Craig, praised the novel as [...] "a tale of magic such as might have been written by the young Jane Austen– or, perhaps, by the young Mrs Radcliffe, whose Gothic imagination and exuberant delicacy of style set the key." [...] However, she also criticised the book: [...] "As fantasy, it is deplorable, given that it fails to embrace the essentially anarchic nature of such tales. What is so wonderful about magicians, wizards and all witches other than Morgan le Fay is not just their magical powers, but that they possess these in spite of being low-born. Far from caring about being gentlemen, wizards are the ultimate expression of rank's <b>irrelevance</b> to talent". However, reviewers were not in universal agreement on any of these points. Maguire wrote in the New York Times: ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews were mixed, and {{the camp}} tone had a mostly {{negative}} reaction. The film currently has a 67% [...] "fresh" [...] rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Connery was applauded by Kevin A. Ranson of MovieCrypt and Michael A. Smith of Nolan's Pop Culture. Critic Roger Ebert noted, {{in a positive}} review, the <b>irrelevance</b> of the plot and [...] "moments of silliness", such as Bond finding himself driving a moon buggy with antennae revolving and robot arms flapping. He praised the Las Vegas car chase scene, particularly the segment when Bond drives the Mustang on two wheels. Twenty-five years after its release, James Berardinelli criticised {{the concept of a}} laser-shooting satellite and the performances of Jill St. John, Norman Burton and Jimmy Dean. Christopher Null called St. John [...] "one of the least effective Bond girls – beautiful, but shrill and helpless". Steve Rhodes said, [...] "looking and acting like a couple of pseudo-country bumpkins, they (Putter Smith and Bruce Glover) seem to have wandered by accident from the adjoining sound stage into the filming of this movie." [...] But he also extolled the car chase as [...] "classic". According to Danny Peary, Diamonds are Forever is [...] "one of the most forgettable movies of the entire Bond series" [...] and that [...] "until Blofeld's reappearance we must watch what is no better than a mundane diamond-smuggling melodrama, without the spectacle we associate with James Bond: the Las Vegas setting isn't exotic enough, there's little humour, assassins Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint are similar to characters you'd find on The Avengers, but not nearly as amusing – and the trouble Bond gets into, even Maxwell Smart could escape." [...] IGN chose it as the third worst James Bond film, behind only The Man with the Golden Gun and Die Another Day. Total Film listed Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd, and Bambi and Thumper, as the first and second worst villains in the Bond series (respectively). The film was more positively received by Xan Brooks of the Guardian, who said it was [...] "oddly brilliant, the best of the bunch: the perfect bleary Bond film for an imperfect bleary western world." ...|$|E
