40|$|This thesis The Role of the Interpreter in Conflict Zones {{presents}} a general overview of some basic characteristics of <b>interpreting</b> <b>in</b> conflict zones. The theoretical part characterizes historical development of <b>interpreting</b> <b>in</b> conflict zones and describes {{the legal status}} of interpreters working in such an environment based on the international humanitarian law. The following section describes the use of interpreters in the Czech Army, examines the language training of the Czech soldiers and defines a summary of the past and current missions of the Czech Army. These descriptions serve as a basis for the empirical section of this thesis which analyzes responses of Czech soldiers represented in the questionnaire survey that aimed to clarify their experiences with <b>interpreting</b> <b>in</b> foreign missions of the Czech Army. The survey shows that the Czech soldiers appreciate the quality of <b>interpreting</b> <b>in</b> foreign missions and prefer to use the local civilian interpreters.

5|$|Potbelly sculptures {{have been}} <b>interpreted</b> <b>in</b> {{a variety of}} manners. Investigators have theorised that potbelly sculptures {{represent}} dead ancestors.

Potbelly monuments have also been associated with a group of supernatural entities associated with the domestic hearth. A further interpretation, based on the sculpture found at Teopán in western El Salvador, interprets potbelly figures as pregnant women at full term, possibly in the very act of giving birth.|$|E

5|$|Wealth is <b>interpreted</b> <b>in</b> {{prosperity}} theology as {{a blessing}} from God, obtained through a spiritual law of positive confession, visualization, and donations. This process is often taught in almost mechanical terms; Kenneth Copeland, an American author and televangelist, argues that prosperity {{is governed by}} laws, while other teachers portray the process formulaically. Journalists David van Biema and Jeff Chu of Time have described Word of Faith pastor Creflo Dollar's teachings about prosperity as an inviolable contract between God and humanity.|$|E
5|$|Another {{performance}} issue {{pertains to}} the choice of tempi, which is of special relevance in Schubert's major instrumental works, particularly in the opening movements. Schubert often notated his opening movements with moderate tempo indications, the extreme case being the Molto moderato of the B-flat piano sonata. The latter movement in particular, has been <b>interpreted</b> <b>in</b> vastly different speeds. Ever since the famous performances by Sviatoslav Richter, taking the opening movement at an extremely slow pace, similar tempo interpretations for this movement have been frequent. However, the majority of Schubert scholars tend to dismiss such an interpretation, arguing instead for a more flowing pace, a measured allegro.|$|E

It is also held that the code was not a statute and restrictions under the code ought to be followed; also, the right to fly the flag is a qualified right, unlike the absolute rights guaranteed to citizens, and should be <b>interpreted</b> <b>in</b> the context of Article 19 of the Constitution of India.|$|E

5|$|In 1893, Matilda Joslyn Gage {{took time}} {{out from her}} {{participation}} in the Revising Committee to write Woman, Church and State, a book which challenged traditional Judeo-Christian teaching that women were the source of sin, and that sex was sinful. Gage wrote that the double standard for morality hurt both sexes. Gage differed {{from most of the}} women on the Revising Committee in that she did not feel that the Bible, once <b>interpreted</b> <b>in</b> a more true, original form, would support women's rights. Gage determined that the Church had acted against women's interests in important ways: from Roman Catholic canon law, to Scripture, to its advocacy of celibacy and more. Especially troubling to Gage was the story of Adam and Eve.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Court of Appeal's judgment can be <b>interpreted</b> <b>in</b> one of two ways: that the exercise of a power is not amenable to judicial review either if it has no public element altogether, or if it has an insufficient public element. Neither of these interpretations is without complications. As regards the first interpretation, {{it may be difficult to}} conceive of an exercise of statutory power that has no public element at all. If the second interpretation is correct, there is doubt as to the level of sufficiency required for the exercise of a power to be amenable to judicial review as the Court did not explain this.|$|E
5|$|Social {{stratification}} is {{the hierarchical}} arrangement of individuals into social classes, castes, and divisions within a society. Modern Western societies stratification traditionally relates to {{cultural and economic}} classes arranged in three main layers: upper class, middle class, and lower class, but each class may be further subdivided into smaller classes (e.g. occupational). Social stratification is <b>interpreted</b> <b>in</b> radically different ways within sociology. Proponents of structural functionalism suggest that, since the stratification of classes and castes is evident in all societies, hierarchy must be beneficial in stabilizing their existence. Conflict theorists, by contrast, critique the inaccessibility of resources and lack of social mobility in stratified societies.|$|E

5|$|Stephen's {{first few}} years as king can be <b>interpreted</b> <b>in</b> {{different}} ways. From a positive perspective, he stabilised the northern border with Scotland, contained Geoffrey's attacks on Normandy, was at peace with Louis VI, enjoyed {{good relations with the}} church and had the broad support of his barons. There were significant underlying problems, nonetheless. The north of England was now controlled by David and Prince Henry, Stephen had abandoned Wales, the fighting in Normandy had considerably destabilised the duchy, and an increasing number of barons felt that Stephen had given them neither the lands nor the titles they felt they deserved or were owed. Stephen was also rapidly running out of money: Henry's considerable treasury had been emptied by 1138 due to the costs of running Stephen's more lavish court and the need to raise and maintain his mercenary armies fighting in England and Normandy.|$|E

The {{full extent of}} the original gospel is unknown; according to a list of canonical and apocryphal works drawn up in the 9th century known as the Stichometry of Nicephorus, the gospel was 2200 lines, just 300 lines shorter than Matthew. Based on the surviving fragments, the overall structure of the gospel appears to have been similar to the canonical ones. It consisted of a narrative of the life of Jesus which included his baptism, temptation, transfiguration, last supper, crucifixion, and resurrection. The gospel also contained sayings of Jesus. The events in the life of Jesus have been <b>interpreted</b> <b>in</b> a way that reflects Jewish ideas present in a Hellenistic cultural environment.|$|E
5|$|The Shiva-related {{tradition}} {{is a major}} part of Hinduism, found all over India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Bali (Indonesia). Its historical roots are unclear and contested. Some scholars such Yashodhar Mathpal and Ali Javid have interpreted early prehistoric paintings at the Bhimbetka rock shelters, carbon dated to be from pre-10,000 BCE period, as Shiva dancing, Shiva's trident, and his mount Nandi. However, Howard Morphy states that these prehistoric rock paintings of India, when seen in their context, are likely those of hunting party with animals, and that the figures in a group dance can be <b>interpreted</b> <b>in</b> many different ways. Rock paintings from Bhimbetka, depicting a figure with a trishul, have been described as Nataraja by Erwin Neumayer, who dates them to the mesolithic.|$|E
