Soil samples from genetic horizons of black earths from areas near Kętrzyn, Gniew and Kujawy, and alluvial soils from Żuławy were used.

Higher bulk porosity corresponds to reduced volumetric heat capacity (C), but increased sorptivity (S) and vapour permeance (W). Since bulk porosity and void size distribution (VSD) are interdependent variables, it follows that for constant particle size distribution (PSD) and compaction energy an increase in porosity results in an increase in the mean pore radius, for a material. This explains why the magnitude of liquid/vapour transfer (S and W) terms are inversely related to the <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>moisture</b> capacity, ξ since the capillary potential, Ψ will increase when the mean pore diameter decreases.

Accurate prediction of the experimental drying rate data was achieved with the developed ANN model, supporting the powerful predictive capacity of ANN modeling method. Ceylan (2008) [13] developed ANNs to predict the drying rate of the timber stack based on temperature and humidity inside the kiln and drying time, and showed that the drying rate was successfully predicted. In the above studies, however, the inherent variation in the drying characteristics between individual timbers was not taken into consideration, and it is unclear that ANNs would be applicable for predicting the moisture contents of each timber in the stack.

The horizontal exposure of wood crossties makes water repellency and dimensional stability particularly important in railroad applications. Ties are typically preservative treated to prolong service life. Preservatives primarily protect against insect and fungal attack, but many also alter hygroscopicity and enhance dimensional stability. Currently, there is no standard method for assessing the water repellency and its interaction with dimensional stability in large wooden members such as railroad ties. Potential methods for assessing moisture behavior were investigated on four wood species. Untreated or materials treated with creosote, pentachlorophenol or ammoniacal copper zinc arsenate were assessed. Samples were subjected to eight accelerated wetting and drying cycles. Dimensional stability and water repellency were evaluated after each cycle using digital image analysis techniques to quantify checking and observing water droplet contact angle over time, respectively. Water repellency varied widely with cycles, but creosote and pentachlorophenol treated samples provided the best resistance to moisture uptake. Dimensional stability was more variable and more dependent on treatment in terms of check development. The results of this work will be used to develop a rapid, reproducible and cost-effective method for assessing the water repellency and dimensional stability of preservative treated wood used in railroad and other applications...|$|R

In this investigation the correlation between data on two different water retention parameters and clay content is examined. The water retention data used in this context are the moisture content at 50 % relative humidity and the water content at the permanent wilting point. The intention is to investigate the possibility of estimating clay content with sufficient accuracy to enable soi 1 texture to be classified from water retention data. The first part of the report consists of a 1 iterature review, in which the most important factors affecting the hygroscopic water and the water content at the permanent wilting point are discussed. The second part contains an account of the investigation and of the statistical relationships obtained. The investigation was carried out on 123 soil samples of different textural classes, representing the different types of arable land in Sweden. The soi 1 samples were analysed in the folloving respects; soi 1 texture (mechanical analysis), content of organic matter (determined as organic carbon), hygroscopic coefficient at 50 relative humidity, loss on ignition and water content at permanent wilting point. The results of the analyses were then treated statistica 11 y. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to compute the statistical relationships between different variables. The relationships examined were: 1. The relationship between <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>moisture,</b> c 1 ay content and loss on ignition (Glf). Equation (3). 2. The relationship between water content at the permanent wilting point (wt 150), clay content and loss on ignition. Equation (7). 3. Clay content as a function of <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>moisture</b> and loss on ignition. Equation (4). 4. Clay content as a function of wt 150 and loss on ignition. Equation (8). Clay contents for the 123 soi 1 samples were then calculated with the equations obtained and compared with the clay contents given by mechanical analysis. The equations were compared with each other in respect of determination coefficient (R 2) and the residua 1 variance obtained. The outcome of this comparison shows tnat equation (8), where the clay content is calculated from wt 150, gives a better correlation between the calculated clay contents and the clay contents given by mechanical analysis than that given by equation (4), where the clay content is calculated from <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>moisture</b> content. Equation (8) is given below; L = - 2, 5 + 2, 8 wt 150 - l, 7 Glf: Glf = loss on ignition In order to test the accuracy of the resu 1 ts, the clay contents for a collection of soil samples not used earlier in the investigation were ca 1 culated using equation (8). These values were then compaired with the clay contents given by mechanical analyses. The results show that although most of the estimated clay contents roughly coincide with the clay contents determined by mechanical analysis, some of the contents calculated diverge widely from those determined. The divergence is most extreme for soil samples with a large content of organic matter and especial 1 y if the percentage of organic matter exceeds the clay content. The reasens for this are discussed. In order to improve the calculation of clay contents some new equations were computed. One of these, equation (12), was obtained from 159 observations and restricted to apply only to mineral soils with a loss on ignition of less than 15 %. Equation (12) is given below: L =- 0, 4 + 2, 9 wt 150 - 1, 2 Glf: To obtain an estimation of how well the clay content of an individual soil sample can be calculated with this equation, a prediction interval was computed. The prediction interval shows that the calculated clay content for an individual observation chosen at random, with 95 %probability will deviate less than 6, 5 per cent from the value given by mechanical analysis. This error might be acceptable for soil samples with high clay content, makes the estimation of c 1 ay content very unreliab 1 e at low leve 1 s.

The resulting UO{sub 2 }F{sub 2 } is <b>hygroscopic,</b> readily absorbing <b>moisture</b> from the air to form hydrates as UO{sub 2 }F{sub 2 }-nH{sub 2 }O. The ratio of hydrogen to uranium can vary from 0 [...] 16, and has significant nuclear criticality safety impacts for large deposits. In order to properly formulate the required course of action, a non-intrusive characterization of the distribution of the fissile material within the pipe, its total mass, and amount of hydration was necessary. The Nuclear Weapons Identification System (NWIS) previously developed at the Oak Ridge Y- 12 Plant for identification of uranium weapons components in storage containers was used to successfully characterize these deposits...|$|R
2500|$|Trimethoxyboroxine(TMB)liquid is a boron {{compound}} {{dissolved in}} methanol {{to give it}} proper fluidity {{and allow it to}} be discharged from a portable fire extinguisher. It was developed in the late 1950s by the U.S. Navy for use on magnesium fires, especially crashed aircraft and aircraft wheel fires from hard landings. It is unique as an extinguishing agent in that the agent itself is a flammable liquid. When TMB contacts the fire, the methanol ignites and burns with a greenish flame due to the boron. As the methanol burns off, a glassy coating of boric oxide is left {{on the surface of the}} metal, creating an air-excluding crust. These extinguishers were made by the Ansul Chemical Co. utilizing TMB agent manufactured by the Callery Chemical Company, and were modified 2.5-gallon water extinguishers (Ansul used re-branded Elkhart extinguishers at the time), with a variable-stream nozzle that could deliver a straight stream or spray at the squeeze of a lever. A 6-inch fluorescent orange band with the letters [...] "TMB" [...] stenciled in black identified TMB from other extinguishers. This agent was problematic in that it had a shelf life of only six months to a year once the extinguisher was filled, since the methanol is extremely <b>hygroscopic</b> (absorbs <b>moisture</b> from the air), which causes corrosion to the extinguisher and renders its use on fire dangerous. These extinguishers were used from the 1950s–70s in various applications, such as the MB-1 and MB-5 crash trucks. The current SOP is to use water fog and cool/burn out the burning metal.|$|R
40|$|International audienceHemp {{concrete}} is a bio-based material generally made of lime-based binder and hemp shiv {{currently used}} for building envelop. This lightweight material shows a thermal conductivity about 100 mW/(m. K). On hygric point of view, hemp concrete is strongly <b>hygroscopic,</b> with high <b>moisture</b> transfer and storage capacities. These properties allow hemp concrete to moderate ambient relative humidity variations. It {{is an excellent}} hygric regulator with moisture buffer values globally higher than 2 g/(m². %RH). On mechanical point of view, hemp concrete is a non-load bearing material. It gains mechanical resistance over {{the first few weeks}} after manufacturing. These mechanical performances depend, among other factors, on the properties of components and on the mix proportioning. In order to improve the mechanical resistance of hemp concrete at early stage, this study investigates new formulations starting from reference formulation. The binder composition varies by increasing the substitution rate of lime-based binder for selected calcium sulfate-based binder. This binder leads to interesting hardening at early stage. The effect on mechanical performances at long term appears effective, without large influences on thermal and hygric properties (maximal variation about 20 % and 15 %). Effective proportioning tool is then available...|$|R
