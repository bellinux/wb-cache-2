5|$|Étienne-Maurice Falconet's marble Milo of Croton (1754) secured his {{admission}} to the Académie <b>des</b> <b>beaux-arts,</b> but was later criticized for lack of nobility. The work clashed with the classical ideal requiring a dying hero to express stoic restraint.|$|E

5|$|Hergé took up {{painting}} as a hobby, producing abstract art works which {{were influenced by}} the styles of Joan Miró and Serge Poliakoff. He showed his work to the art historian Léo Van Puyvelde, who was the chief conservator of the Musées <b>des</b> <b>Beaux-Arts,</b> who believed that they showed promise but that Hergé's real talent lay with cartoon drawing. Hergé abandoned painting shortly after, having produced 37 paintings in all.|$|E
5|$|He {{was also}} {{invited to attend}} {{numerous}} international festivals throughout his career, and presented lectures and talks at academic institutions across the world. He was made an honorary member of the Akademie der Künste of the DDR in 1979, and the American Institute of Arts and Letters in 1985. He {{was admitted to the}} French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 1985, and the Académie <b>des</b> <b>Beaux-Arts</b> in 1986. He was the recipient of the 22nd Suntory Music Award (1990). Takemitsu was posthumously awarded the fourth Glenn Gould Prize in Autumn, 1996.|$|E
5|$|Invader is a {{graduate}} of the École <b>des</b> <b>Beaux-Arts,</b> a Parisian art school. Invader initially derived inspiration for his creations from video games from the late 1970s to early 1980s that he played when he was growing up, particularly characters from Space Invaders, from which he derived his name. Games of the era were made with 8-bit graphics, and so lend themselves well to his method of each tile representing one pixel. Invader began making mosaics in Paris in the 1990s and then in 31 other cities in France.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} palace has been home to three of Strasbourg's most {{important}} museums: the Archaeological Museum (Musée archéologique, basement), the Museum of Decorative Arts (Musée des arts décoratifs, ground floor) and the Museum of Fine Arts (Musée <b>des</b> <b>beaux-arts,</b> first and second floor). The municipal art gallery, Galerie Robert Heitz, in a lateral wing of the palace, is used for temporary exhibitions. The Palais Rohan has been listed since 1920 as a Monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.|$|E
5|$|The large centre canvas has {{not been}} {{positively}} identified. However both Koch and Campbell believe that a damaged Crucifixion, now in the Musées royaux <b>des</b> <b>Beaux-Arts,</b> Brussels, was probably the centrepiece. Its size (181×153.5cm) is exactly double that of the four wing panels. Campbell believes that the altarpiece was painted on commission for export, most likely to Venice. The altarpiece was probably broken up as large religious works {{had fallen out of}} fashion by the 17th century, and would have had more value as single panels.|$|E
5|$|Two {{drawings}} {{on paper}} in the British Museum and the École nationale supérieure <b>des</b> <b>Beaux-Arts</b> were at times thought to be studies for the Munich Nativity. The lines of the folds in the garments closely match those of the painting, although the technical ability does not. The Paris drawing has blotches of paint indicating {{that it was a}} study piece for workshop members. The London piece is superior, but its lines are more rigid, lacking Lochner's fluidity, and so its attribution has been relegated to a draughtsman closely associated with Lochner.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} he painted September Morn, Paul Émile Chabas (1869–1937) already had an {{established}} reputation as an academic artist. He regularly submitted to the Paris Salon, first participating in 1886. He won a third class medal in the Salon of 1895, and four years later won the Prix National for his painting Joyeux ébats, which earned him a {{gold medal at the}} 1900 Exposition Universelle and was acquired by the Musée <b>des</b> <b>Beaux-Arts</b> de Nantes. In subsequent years Chabas spent the winters working in Paris, while he passed his summers painting young women along the shores of rivers, lakes, and seas. In 1902 he was made a Chevalier in the Legion of Honour.|$|E
5|$|His {{reputation}} as a composer continued to grow and in 1959, he was nominated as an Officier of the Légion d'honneur. In 1966 he was officially appointed professor of composition at the Paris Conservatoire, although he had in effect been teaching composition for years. Further honours included election to the Institut de France in 1967 and the Académie <b>des</b> <b>beaux-arts</b> in 1968, the Erasmus Prize in 1971, the award of the Royal Philharmonic Society Gold Medal and the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize in 1975, the Sonning Award (Denmark's highest musical honour) in 1977, the Wolf Prize in Arts in 1982, and {{the presentation of the}} Croix de Commander of the Belgian Order of the Crown in 1980.|$|E
5|$|In 1857, Rodin {{submitted}} a clay {{model of a}} companion to the École <b>des</b> <b>Beaux-Arts</b> {{in an attempt to}} win entrance; he did not succeed, and two further applications were also denied. Given that entrance requirements at the Grande École were not particularly high, the rejections were considerable setbacks. Rodin's inability to gain entrance may have been due to the judges' Neoclassical tastes, while Rodin had been schooled in light, 18th-century sculpture. Leaving the Petite École in 1857, Rodin earned a living as a craftsman and ornamenter for most of the next two decades, producing decorative objects and architectural embellishments.|$|E

5|$|In 1910, an {{exhibition}} in the Grand Palais of Paris {{was devoted to}} his work, during the annual salon of the Société <b>des</b> <b>Beaux-Arts</b> (Fine Arts Society) of France. Gaudí participated on the invitation of count Güell, displaying a series of pictures, plans and plaster scale models of several of his works. Although he participated hors concours, he received good reviews from the French press. A large part of this exposition could be seen the following year at the I Salón Nacional de Arquitectura {{that took place in}} the municipal exhibition hall of El Buen Retiro in Madrid.|$|E
5|$|The Proclamation of Dušan's Law Codex {{was well}} {{received}} by the Serbian public, and {{is said to have}} exceeded the expectations of all the government ministers.

By way of this decision, the art historian Jelena Milojković-Djurić asserts, the Paris committee recognized that the painting was on par with those of the world's best visual artists.|$|E
5|$|The {{architects of}} early skyscrapers faced {{a number of}} challenges. The most fashionable {{architectural}} style in the late 19th century was the French Beaux-Arts movement, sometimes termed the Italian Renaissance style, which applied Classical aesthetic principles to modern buildings. American architects trained in the Beaux-Arts style at the Parisian Académie <b>des</b> <b>Beaux-Arts</b> began to return home in the 1880s, bringing these ideals and standards with them. Applying contemporary Beaux-Arts standards to early skyscrapers, however, was not straightforward. The buildings that the Beaux-Arts movement influenced were typically much shorter and broader than any skyscraper, and {{it was difficult to}} accurately reproduce the style in a tall, narrow building.|$|E

5|$|Van Gogh {{returned}} to Cuesmes in August 1880, where he lodged with a miner until October. He {{became interested in}} the people and scenes around him, and recorded them in drawings after Theo's suggestion that he take up art in earnest. He travelled to Brussels later in the year, to follow Theo's recommendation that he study with the Dutch artist Willem Roelofs, who persuaded him – in spite of his dislike of formal schools of art – to attend the Académie Royale <b>des</b> <b>Beaux-Arts.</b> He registered at the Académie in November 1880, where he studied anatomy and the standard rules of modelling and perspective.|$|E
5|$|While she {{exhibited}} {{many of the}} Australian works completed {{before arriving}} in France, she was also creating many new works, including illustrations and portraits of traditional life and costume, produced during a summer in Brittany. In 1926, Rix Nicholas was again included in London's Royal Academy of Art exhibition, where one of her Brittany paintings, Le Bigouden, was hung. She also appeared at the Société Nationale <b>des</b> <b>Beaux-Arts</b> Spring exhibition in Paris, {{in which she had}} eight works, a very large number for a single artist. The Société not only hung many of her paintings and drawings: she was also elected an Associate to the organisation in that year.|$|E
5|$|According to {{at least}} one account, Bogdan-Pitești was educated in Geneva, at a local Catholic institution. Raised in the Romanian Orthodox faith, he {{converted}} to Catholicism in his twenties, but was no longer a practicing Catholic by the time of his death. He supposedly attended medical school at the University of Montpellier, without ever graduating, and afterwards left to join the bohemian milieu of Paris. He may have enrolled at the University of Paris, studying Law and Letters, but probably withdrew after a short while. Art historian Sanda Miller recounts that Bogdan-Pitești attended the École <b>des</b> <b>Beaux-Arts</b> in the French capital, but that he was ultimately expelled. Other sources express doubt that the Romanian aristocrat was ever affiliated with any university or college, in either France or Switzerland.|$|E
