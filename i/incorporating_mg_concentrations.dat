40|$|Introduction Magnesium (Mg) plays {{a crucial}} role in cell {{physiology}} and its deficiency may cause many disorders which often require intensive treatment. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse some factors affecting preoperative plasma <b>Mg</b> <b>concentration</b> in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Material and Methods Adult patients scheduled for elective CABG with cardio-pulmonary bypass (CPB) under general anaesthesia were studied. Plasma <b>Mg</b> <b>concentration</b> was analysed before surgery in accordance with age, domicile, profession, tobacco smoking and preoperative Mg supplementation. Blood samples were obtained from the radial artery just before the administration of anaesthesia. Results 150 patients were studied. Mean preoperative plasma <b>Mg</b> <b>concentration</b> was 0. 93 ± 0. 17 mmol/L; mean concentration in patients – 1. 02 ± 0. 16; preoperative Mg supplementation was significantly higher than in patients without such supplementation. Moreover, intellectual workers supplemented Mg more frequently and had higher plasma <b>Mg</b> <b>concentration</b> than physical workers. Plasma <b>Mg</b> <b>concentration</b> decreases in elderly patients. Patients living in cities, on average, had the highest plasma <b>Mg</b> <b>concentration.</b> Smokers had significantly lower plasma <b>Mg</b> <b>concentration</b> than non-smokers. Conclusions 1.

These trials used different sources of genotypes, including old French landraces, a worldwide germplasm collection and elite breeding lines or modem cultivars, grown in different environments. <b>Mg</b> <b>concentration</b> ranged from 600 to 1400 ppm in modem material, and reached 1890 ppm in some exotic genotypes. There was a negative correlation between grain yield and <b>Mg</b> <b>concentration,</b> but despite this dilution effect enough variability remains useful for selection purposes. Analysis of variance showed high genotype effects and Spearman rank correlations indicated moderate genotype by environment (G x E) interactions, so breeding for high <b>Mg</b> <b>concentration</b> can reasonably be envisaged.

DESIGN: A prospective cross-sectional study followed by a prospective comparative study. SETTING: Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Department of Pediatrics and Genetics, Hopital Cantonal Universitaire Geneve, Switzerland. SUBJECTS: Seventy-one healthy pregnant women, with normal pregnancies between 6 and 38 weeks gestation. The second part included 43 women in the third trimester of pregnancy, 11 had GH, 11 had PE and 21 formed the comparison group of healthy normotensive women. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total serum and intralymphocytic <b>Mg</b> <b>concentrations</b> and urinary <b>Mg</b> excretion. RESULTS: There was a progressive reduction in total serum magnesium concentrations during normal pregnancy, thought to be partly due to haemodilution, because the decline in concentration of serum proteins paralleled that of Mg (P less than 0. 001). In the three groups studied in the third trimester the serum <b>Mg</b> <b>concentration</b> was very similar in the GH and the comparison groups, but it was significantly higher in the PE group (P less than 0. 01).

In contrast, increased soil acidity resulting from N fertilization to spring wheat every year probably increased dissolutions of Ca and Mg which were either taken up by the crop or moved down the soil profile, resulting in lower Ca and <b>Mg</b> <b>concentrations</b> at the surface layer and increased with depth in NTCW, STCW, and FSTCW. Increased <b>Mg</b> <b>concentration</b> with depth as opposed to similar levels of Ca concentration below 30  cm indicates that the proportion of Mg-containing minerals increased with depth while the amount of Ca-containing minerals remained the same. As with pH and buffer pH, tillage had no effect on these nutrients, a case in contrast to those reported for various levels of Ca and Mg in no-tillage and conventional tillage systems at various depths (Tarkalson et al. 2006). This could be a result of differences in the amount of crop residue returned to the soil among tillage systems. Mean annualized crop residue returned to the soil was not different among NTCW, STCW, and FSTCW in this study, but was greater in no-till than conventional till in the experiment described by Tarkalson et al.

Due to the smaller radius of Mg ions, the volume of the unit cell and the crystallite size decreased as discussed in the XRD analysis, which can lead to the blue shift of the absorption and PL spectra. When the <b>Mg</b> <b>concentration</b> is increased beyond 4 at %, the excess dopant ions could cause more deformation of the ZnS lattice that deteriorated the optical properties. Similarly, a small blue shift with Mg doping was reported in cubic structured ZnS:Mg nanoparticles [34].|$|R
30|$|All thermal {{features}} in NW Sabalan arise {{mainly from the}} gravels of the Dizu formation (Fig.  1 b). There is no spring reported in downstream areas at lower elevations. Their water is characterised with a simple dilution trend indicating mixing with varying amounts of shallow groundwater (Table  1). They show a strong seasonal cyclic variation in flow rate; however, very slight seasonal deviation in temperature or chemistry can be seen. Despite the elevated Cl concentration, isotopic data categorised the waters to lie on the local meteoric water line. <b>Mg</b> <b>concentrations</b> exhibit a weak inverse correlation with Cl. This may suggest that geothermal fluids containing elevated Cl concentrations are diluting with the shallow groundwater aquifer consisting of high <b>Mg</b> <b>concentrations.</b>|$|R

The effects of the <b>Mg</b> <b>concentrations</b> (0, 1 and 5 at %) and working gas compositions (pure Ar and Ar-O 2 mixture) on the structural and optical properties of the ZnO:Mg thin films were investigated. The experiment {{results showed that the}} ZnO and ZnO:Mg thin films are polycrystalline with a hexagonal wurtzite structure exhibiting a preferred (002) crystal plane orientation. The results indicated that the crystallinity of ZnO:Mg thin films was significantly affected by both Mg-doping and the woking gas composition.

40|$|Based on the effective-mass model, {{the lower}} {{energies}} {{of the electron}} and the hole of ZnO/MgxZn 1 -xO superlattices are calculated. Because of the mismatch of the lattice constant between the ZnO well and the MgxZn 1 -xO barrier, piezoelectric and spontaneous polarization exist in ZnO/MgxZn 1 -xO superlattices and a macroscopical internal electric held is found when well width L-w > 4 nm and <b>Mg</b> <b>concentration</b> x > 0. 2. The parameters of ZnO/MgxZn 1 -xO superlattices such as lattice constant, band offset, etc. are also proposed. Through calculations, we found the internal electric field can change the lowest energies of the electron and hole to 105. 4 and 85. 1 meV when well width L-w up to 70 angstrom, which will influence the electronic and optical properties of ZnO/MgxZn 1 -xO superlattices greatly, while the Rashba effect from the internal electric field is so small {{that it can be}} neglected. The ground state exciton energies with different <b>Mg</b> <b>concentration</b> x are also calculated by variational method, our results are very close to the experimental results when <b>Mg</b> <b>concentration</b> x <= 0. 3.

40|$|If 4 -day-old dark-grown {{zucchini}} squash seedlings (Cucurbita pepo L. cv. Black Beauty) {{are exposed}} briefly to red light, subsequent cell fractionation yields about 40 % {{of the total}} extractable phytochrome in the far red-absorbing form bound to a particulate fraction. The amount of far red-absorbing phytochrome in the pellet {{is strongly dependent on}} the <b>Mg</b> <b>concentration</b> in the extraction medium. The apparent density of the Pfr-containing particles following sedimentation on sucrose gradients corresponds to 15 % (w/w) sucrose with 0. 1 mm Mg and 40 % sucrose with 10 mm Mg. This particulate fraction could be readily separated from mitochondria and other particulate material by taking advantage of these apparent density changes with changes in <b>Mg</b> <b>concentration.</b> Electron microscopy of negatively stained preparations shows that with 1 mm Mg only minute particles are present. These were too small to reveal structural detail with this technique. With 3 mm Mg, separate membranous vesicles between 400 and 600 Ångstroms in diameter appear. At higher <b>Mg</b> <b>concentrations,</b> the vesicles aggregate, causing obvious turbity. The effect of Mg on vesicle formation and aggregation is completely reversible.

40|$|The {{effect of}} Mg doping on the {{microstructure}} of InN epitaxial films {{in relation to}} their free-charge carrier properties has been investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and aberration corrected scanning TEM. We observe a direct correlation between <b>Mg</b> <b>concentration</b> and the formation of stacking faults. The threading dislocation density is found to be independent of <b>Mg</b> <b>concentration.</b> The critical <b>Mg</b> <b>concentration</b> for the on-set of stacking faults formation is determined and found to correlate with the switch from p- to n-type conductivity in InN. Potential mechanisms involving stacking faults and point defect complexes are invoked in order to explain the observed conductivity reversal. Finally, the stacking faults are structurally determined and their role in the reduction of the free electron mobility in highly doped InN: Mg is discussed. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.

40|$|Calcium (Ca) and {{magnesium}} (Mg) are essential plant nutrients and vital for {{human and animal}} nutrition. Biofortification of crops has previously been suggested to alleviate widespread human Ca and Mg deficiencies. In this study, new candidate genes influencing the leaf accumulation of Ca and Mg were identified in young Brassica napus plants using associative transcriptomics of bionomics datasets. A total of 247 and 166 SNP markers were associated with leaf Ca and <b>Mg</b> <b>concentration,</b> respectively, after false discovery rate correction and removal of SNPs with low second allele frequency. Gene expression markers at similar positions were also associated with leaf Ca and <b>Mg</b> <b>concentration,</b> including loci on chromosomes A 10 and C 2, within which lie previously identified transporter genes ACA 8 and MGT 7. Further candidate genes were selected from seven loci and the mineral composition of whole Arabidopsis thaliana shoots were characterized from lines mutated in orthologous genes. Four and two mutant lines had reduced shoot Ca and <b>Mg</b> <b>concentration,</b> respectively, compared to wild type plants. Three of these mutations {{were found to have}} tissue specific effects; notably reduced silique Ca in all three such mutant lines.

40|$|Hole {{conductivity}} and photoluminescence {{were studied}} in Mg-doped InN films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Because surface electron accumulation interferes with carrier type determination by electrical measurements, {{the nature of}} the majority carriers in the bulk of the films was determined using thermopower measurements. <b>Mg</b> <b>concentrations</b> in a "window" from ca. 3 x 1017 to 1 x 1019 cm- 3 produce hole-conducting, p-type films as evidenced by a positive Seebeck coecient. This conclusion is supported by electrolyte-based capacitance voltage measurements and by changes in the overall mobility observed by Hall effect, both of which are consistent with a change from surface accumulation on an n-type film to surface inversion on a p-type film. The observed Seebeck coefficients are understood in terms of a parallel conduction model with contributions from surface and bulk regions. In partially compensated films with <b>Mg</b> <b>concentrations</b> below the window region, two peaks are observed in photoluminescence at 672 meV and at 603 meV. They are attributed to band-to-band and band-to-acceptor transitions, respectively, and an acceptor binding energy of ~;; 70 meV is deduced. In hole-conducting films with <b>Mg</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the window region, no photoluminescence is observed; this is attributed to electron trapping by deep states which are empty for Fermi levels close to the valence band edge...|$|R
