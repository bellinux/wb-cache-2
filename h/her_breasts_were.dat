In Alpha 3, <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> <b>were</b> covered by two blue heart shaped patterns, but in SFV the blue hearts were replaced by a heart-shaped hole in the chest of her leotard.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, on the RAI show C'era due Volte, <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> <b>were</b> {{the first}} to be bared live on Italian TV. Staller {{appeared}} in her first hardcore pornographic film, Telefono rosso (Red telephone) in 1983. She produced the film together with Schicchi's company Diva Futura. Her memoirs were published as Confessioni erotiche di Cicciolina (Erotic confessions of Cicciolina) by Olympia Press of Milan in 1987. That same year she appeared in , called The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empress in the United States, co-starring John Holmes. The film would later create a furor when it was revealed that Holmes had tested positive for HIV prior to appearing in it. Staller has appeared nude in Playboy's editions in several countries. Her first Playboy appearance was in Argentina in March 1988. Other appearances for the magazine were in the U.S. (September 1990), Hungary (June 2005), Serbia (July 2005) and Mexico (September 2005).|$|E
500|$|In April 1957, <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> <b>were</b> {{the focus}} of a notorious {{publicity}} stunt intended to deflect media attention from Sophia Loren during a dinner party in the Italian star's honor. Photographs of the encounter were published around the world. The best-known photo showed Loren's gaze falling on the cleavage of the American actress (who was seated between Loren and her dinner companion, Clifton Webb) when Mansfield leaned over the table, allowing her breasts to spill over her low neckline and exposing one nipple. The Jayne Mansfield-Sophia Loren photo inspired a number of later photographers. The photograph of that episode was a UPI sensation, appearing in newspapers and magazines with the word [...] "censored" [...] hiding the actress's exposed bosom.|$|E

500|$|The {{ice skating}} scenes were shot {{in an actual}} rink. According to Jenna Fischer, Steve Carell used to play hockey, and the writers {{had been looking for}} a reason to use Carell's ice skating skills in an episode. Fischer had also learned to skate in {{preparation}} for the movie Blades of Glory, but the writers decided that {{there was no reason for}} Pam to be a good skater, so they had Pam lean on Jim. Saturday Night Live alumna Nancy Walls, who played Carol Stills, is actually Steve Carell's wife. At the rink, Michael tells Pam to be wary of breast cancer. This is the third joke that Stupnitsky and Eisenberg had aimed at Pam's breasts, after one each in [...] "The Fight" [...] and [...] "The Secret". Fischer later jokingly said that [...] "my breasts play a central role in one of tonight's scenes." [...] Fischer also noted that, due to the slight emphasis <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> <b>were</b> receiving, many fans on the internet were arguing that Fischer had had breast implants. Fischer denied the rumors, but stated that she was [...] "flattered".|$|E
500|$|Her outfit in Lightning Returns was {{designed}} by Nomura. He was told by Toriyama to create something representative of her final battle, with [...] "strength" [...] as the main guideline. The resultant outfit, which resembles a leather bodysuit, has spinal column patterns on its sleeves and is primarily colored red and white. Nomura later commented that he felt [...] "a strong reaction within [...] " [...] while creating Lightning's final look. Nomura's design was Kamikokuryo's favorite out of the many outfits created for the character. Her other outfits for the game were designed by Kamikokuryo, Toshiyuki Itahana, and Toshitaka Matsuda: many of them drew inspiration from the character designs of regular Final Fantasy artist Yoshitaka Amano. In addition to the new costumes, Lightning's in-game model was rebuilt from the ground-up. <b>Her</b> <b>breasts</b> <b>were</b> enlarged and several of her outfits were designed to present her in a more feminine way. For the game's epilogue, Toriyama wished for Lightning to appear in an everyday setting and normal clothes. The team considered ending the game with Lightning either meeting or speaking with her allies, but Toriyama wished the story to begin and end with her alone. He has claimed that Lightning, with her solo role in Lightning Returns, was the Final Fantasy series' [...] "first female protagonist".|$|E
500|$|Unlike Queen's {{previous}} albums, {{the artwork}} for Real features provocative photography; her middle and thighs are emphasized {{to create a}} sexy image. Queen said <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> <b>were</b> enlarged from a B to a C cup, adding that the packaging described the style of music on the album. The album cover also features Queen's signature long nails, which she sports {{in a variety of}} colors. Incorporating graffiti, the album has [...] "street cred" [...] in the U.S.-centered hip-hop world. The change in image for Queen is attributed to Universal Latino's feeling that Real had crossover potential for U.S. mainstream audiences. The album's title suggests this; it means [...] "real" [...] in English and Spanish and [...] "royal" [...] in Spanish, hinting at Queen's status as the Queen of Reggaetón. It is also Queen's response to Puerto Rican criticism for looking like a tomboy, wearing baggy pants and large shirts (which she addresses in her autobiography, Detrás Del Glamour [...] ). She accepted responsibility for her change in image, attributing it to a [...] "new growth in person" [...] and admitting that the makeover stemmed from a [...] "crisis" [...] and [...] "female vanity". To change her figure, Queen used a Colombian plastic surgeon.|$|E

500|$|Bride of Frankenstein was {{subjected}} to censorship, both during production by the Hays office and following its release by local and national censorship boards. Joseph Breen, lead censor for the Hays office, objected to lines of dialogue in the originally submitted script in which Henry Frankenstein and his work were {{compared to that of}} God. He continued to object to such dialogue in revised scripts, and to a planned shot of the Monster rushing through a graveyard to a figure of a crucified Jesus and attempting to [...] "rescue" [...] the figure from the cross. Breen also objected to the number of murders, both seen and implied by the script and strongly advised Whale to reduce the number. The censor's office, upon reviewing the film in March 1935, required a number of cuts. Whale agreed to delete a sequence in which Dwight Frye's [...] "Nephew Glutz" [...] kills his uncle and blames the Monster, and shots of Elsa Lanchester as Mary Shelley in which Breen felt too much of <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> <b>were</b> visible. Curiously, despite his earlier objection, Breen offered no objection to the cruciform imagery throughout the film– including a scene with the Monster lashed Christ-like to a pole– nor to the presentation of Pretorius as a coded homosexual. Bride of Frankenstein was approved by the Production Code office on April 15, 1935.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} version, {{which was used}} from 1987–92, <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> <b>were</b> covered by her flowing hair, but her navel was still visible. The fish tail was cropped slightly, and the primary color was changed from brown to green, {{a nod to the}} Alma Mater of the three founders, the University of San Francisco. In the third version, used between 1992 and 2011, her navel and breasts are not visible at all, and only vestiges remain of the fish tails. The {{original}} [...] "woodcut" [...] logo has been moved to the Starbucks' Headquarters in Seattle.|$|E

60|$|When Philip entered, {{the people}} in the studio had looked at him curiously, and the model gave him an {{indifferent}} glance, but now they ceased to pay attention to him. Philip, with his beautiful sheet of paper in front of him, stared awkwardly at the model. He {{did not know how to}} begin. He had never seen a naked woman before. She was not young and <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> <b>were</b> shrivelled. She had colourless, fair hair that fell over her forehead untidily, and her face was covered with large freckles. He glanced at Miss Price's work. She had only been working on it two days, and it looked as though she had had trouble; her paper was in a mess from constant rubbing out, and to Philip's eyes the figure looked strangely distorted.|$|E
60|$|She {{was very}} oddly dressed; {{she was quite}} naked from her head to below her breasts; <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> <b>were</b> plump and round, not flaggy and hanging down, as it {{generally}} is with the Indian women, some of whose breasts hang as low as their bellies, but projecting as beautifully {{as if they had}} been laced up with stays round her body; and below her breast she had a broad piece of a skin of some curious creature, spotted like a leopard, probably of some fine spotted deer. This was wrapped round her very tight, like a body-girt to a horse; and under this she had a kind of petticoat, as before described, hanging down to her ankles. As for shoes or stockings, they were only such as nature had furnished. Her hair was black, and, as supposed, very long, being wreathed up and twisted in long locks about the plate of gold she wore; for when she pulled off the plate above mentioned, it hung down her back and upon her shoulders very gracefully; but it seems she did not think so, for, as soon as she found it so fallen down, she caused one of her women to roll it up, and tie it in a great knot which hung down in her neck, and did not look so well as when it was loose.|$|E
60|$|Thuvia of Ptarth {{looked into}} his face for several moments. <b>Her</b> <b>breast</b> <b>was</b> rising and falling as though to some resistless emotion. She half {{took a step toward}} him. Her lips parted as though to speak--swiftly and impetuously.|$|R

They don't care. Complimented perhaps. Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night prayers with the kiddies. Well, aren't they? See her as she is spoil all. Must have the stage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music. The name too. Amours of actresses. Nell Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud Branscombe. Curtain up. Moonlight silver effulgence. Maiden {{discovered}} with pensive bosom. Little sweetheart come and kiss me. Still, I feel. The strength it gives a man. That's the secret of it. Good job I let off there behind the wall coming out of Dignam's. Cider that was. Otherwise I couldn't have. Makes you want to sing after. Lacaus esant taratara. Suppose I spoke to her. What about? Bad plan however if you don't know how to end the conversation. Ask them a question they ask you another. Good idea if you're stuck. Gain time. But then you're in a cart. Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and you see she's on for it: good evening. O but the dark evening in the Appian way I nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was. Whew! Girl in Meath street that night. All the dirty things I made her say. All wrong of course. My arks she called it. It's so hard to find one who. Aho! If you don't answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they harden. And kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings. Parrots. Press the button and the bird will squeak. Wish she hadn't called me sir. O, her mouth in the dark! And you a married man with a single girl! That's what they enjoy. Taking a man from another woman. Or even hear of it. Different with me. Glad to get away from other chap's wife. Eating off his cold plate. Chap in the Burton today spitting back gumchewed gristle. French letter still in my pocketbook. Cause of half the trouble. But might happen sometime, I don't think. Come in, all is prepared. I dreamt. What? Worst is beginning. How they change the venue when it's not what they like. Ask you do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who. Or ask you what someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped. Yet if I went the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that. Because I did. She too. Offend her. Then make it up. Pretend to want something awfully, then cry off for her sake. Flatters them. She must have been thinking of someone else all the time. What harm? Must since she came to the use of reason, he, he and he. First kiss does the trick. The propitious moment. Something inside them goes pop. Mushy like, tell by their eye, on the sly. First thoughts are best. Remember that till their dying day. Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the Moorish wall beside the gardens. Fifteen she told me. But <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> <b>were</b> developed. Fell asleep then.
