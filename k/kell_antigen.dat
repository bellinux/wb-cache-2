5000|$|Kell antigens are {{important}} in transfusion medicine, autoimmune hemolytic anemia and hemolytic disease of the newborn (anti-Kell). Anti-K is the next most common immune red cell antibody after those in the ABO and Rh system. Anti-K typically presents as IgG class alloantibody. Individuals lacking a specific <b>Kell</b> <b>antigen</b> may develop antibodies against Kell antigens when transfused with blood containing that antigen. This is particularly true for the [...] "K" [...] antigen which shows a relatively high antigenicity and moderately low frequency (~9%) in Caucasian populations. Anti-K can also occur following transplacental hemorrhage (TPH) associated with childbirth making Kell an important concern for hemolytic disease of the newborn. Following the formation of anti-K, subsequent blood transfusions may be marked by destruction of the new cells by these antibodies, {{a process known as}} hemolysis. Anti-K does not bind complement, therefore hemolysis is extravascular. Individuals without K antigens(K0) who have formed an antibody to a K antigen, must be transfused with blood from donors who are also K0 to prevent hemolysis.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Partial {{phenotyping}} {{of voluntary}} blood donors has {{vital role in}} transfusion practice, population genetic study and in resolving legal issues. The Rh blood group {{is one of the}} most complex and highly immunogenic blood group known in humans. The Kell system, discovered in 1946, is the third most potent system at triggering hemolytic transfusion reactions and consists of 25 highly immunogenic antigens. Knowledge of Rh & Kell phenotypes in given population is relevant for better planning and management of blood bank; the main goal is to find compatible blood for patients needing multiple blood transfusions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of Rh & Kell phenotype of voluntary donors in Gujarat state. Materials and Methods: The present study was conducted by taking 5670 samples from random voluntary blood donors coming in blood donation camp. Written consent was taken for donor phenotyping. The antigen typing of donors was performed by Qwalys- 3 (manufacturer: Diagast) by using electromagnetic technology on Duolys plates. Results: Out of 5670 donors, the most common Rh antigen observed in the study population was e (99. 07 %) followed by D (95. 40 %), C (88. 77 %), c (55. 89 %) and E (17. 88 %). The frequency of the <b>Kell</b> <b>antigen</b> (K) was 1. 78 %. Discussion: The antigen frequencies among blood donors from Gujarat were compared with those published for other Indian populations. The frequency of D antigen in our study (95. 4 %) and north Indian donors (93. 6) was significantly higher than in the Caucasians (85 %) and lower than in the Chinese (99 %). The frequencies of C, c and E antigens were dissimilar to other ethnic groups while the ′e′ antigen was present in high frequency in our study as also in the other ethnic groups. <b>Kell</b> <b>antigen</b> (K) was found in only 101 (1. 78 %) donors out of 5670. Frequency of <b>Kell</b> <b>antigen</b> in Caucasian and Black populations is 9 % & 2 % respectively. The most common Kell phenotype was K-k+, not just in Indians (96. 5 %) but also in Caucasians (91 %), Blacks (98 %) and Chinese (100 %). Conclusion: Phenotype and probable genotype showed wide range of variations in different races and religion. Reliable population based frequency data of Rh & Kell antigens has vital role in population genetic study, in resolving medico legal issues and in transfusion practice...|$|E
40|$|Background: The Kell {{blood group}} system expresses {{high and low}} {{frequency}} antigens with the most important in relation to transfusion including the antithetic KEL 1 and KEL 2; KEL 3 and KEL 4; KEL 6 and KEL 7 antigens. Kell is a clinically relevant system, as it is highly immunogenic and anti-KEL antibodies are associated with hemolytic transfusion reactions and hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn. Although required in some situations, <b>Kell</b> <b>antigen</b> phenotyping is restricted due to technical limitations. In these cases, molecular approaches may be a solution. This study proposes three polymerase chain reaction genotyping protocols to analyze the single nucleotide polymorphisms responsible for six Kell antithetic antigens expressed in a Brazilian population. Methods: DNA was extracted from 800 blood donor samples and three polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism protocols were used to genotype the KEL* 1 /KEL* 2, KEL* 3 /KEL* 4 and KEL* 6 /KEL* 7 alleles. KEL* 3 /KEL* 4 and KEL* 6 /KEL* 7 genotyping was standardized using the NlalII and MnlI restriction enzymes and validated using sequencing. KEL* 1 /KEL* 2 genotyping was performed using a previously reported assay. Results: KEL genotyping was successfully implemented in the service; the following distribution of KEL alleles was obtained for a population from southeastern Brazil: KEL* 1 (22 %), KEL* 2 (97. 8 %), KEL* 3 (0. 69 %), KEL* 4 (99. 31 %), KEL* 6 (2. 69 %o) and KEL* 7 (9731 %o). Additionally, two individuals with rare genotypes, KEL* 1 /KEL* 1 and KEL* 3 /KEL* 3, were identified. Conclusion: KEL allele genotyping using these methods proved to be reliable and applicable to predict <b>Kell</b> <b>antigen</b> expressions in a Brazilian cohort. This easy and efficient strategy can be employed to provide safer transfusions and to help in rare donor screening...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Hydrops Fetalis is {{a serious}} {{condition}} in fetal period, characterized {{by the presence of}} serous fluid accumulation in at least two potential spaces in fetus including pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and ascites. The incidence of hydrops fetalis is one per 2500 - 3000 pregnancies. This condition is followed by different diseases. Fetal hemolytic anemia and its hypoxemia due to hydrops fetalis are potentially life or function threatening. Mortality rate is 50 - 90 %; this poor prognosis is improving with advances in prenatal and medical treatment.                    Methods and Materials This study performed on patients’ records with hydrops fetalis diagnosis in one of the neonatal referral and academic center, Vali-e-Asr Hospital Tehran, the capital of Iran from 2003 to 2010. Etiology, prognosis, and frequency of Hydrops fetalis in newborns were evaluated.

40|$|To the Editors; With great initial {{interest}} we {{read the}} report of brothers with a neuroacanthocytosis syndrome 1 but were later disap-pointed by the unmentioned fact that {{the details of the}} cases are identical to those of a previous publication by the sen-ior author 2. Despite the time interval of 22 years since that original paper, the only significant additions in this dupli-cate publication are the color video stills and the figure of the brain MRI. Figure 1, of a peripheral blood smear with acanthocytes, was already made available to the public in an online medical resource 3 (www. emedicine. com) and the connection with the present cases remains unclear. There is a hint that post mortem examination may have been per-formed as a further new fact.

Almost total absence of Kell antigens from the RBCs of a German man with no symptoms of neuroacanthocytosis could not {{be due to the}} Kell-null phenotype, Ko, because his RBCs had very weak expression of Kx antigen and his three children were Kp(a + b+).

The hazard of red cell alloimmunization, however, is one of the main complications of this therapy.   Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of red cell alloimmunization in Omani patients with sickle cell anemia and thalassaemia.   Methods: This study included 262 patients whose historical transfusion records were available. One hundred and twenty-nine patients with thalassaemia who were attending the day care unit for regular transfusions, and 133 sickle cell anemia patients admitted at our hospital were included in this study. The Diamed gel system was used for the screening and identification of atypical antibodies.   Results: The rate of alloimmunization in sickle cell anemia patients was 31 % (n= 41), whereas in thalassaemia patients it was 20 % (n= 26). Antibodies to E, e, C, c, D, K, S, Fyª, Kpª, Jkª and Cw were observed.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Red {{blood cell}} (RBC) alloimmunization {{is still an}} actual problem in our {{transfusion}} practice. In 2011, {{in addition to the}} regular ABO/D blood group typing, phenotyping for Rh (C, c, E, e) and <b>Kell</b> <b>antigens</b> was introduced for blood donors and patients undergoing blood transfusion. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of the extended RBC typing and donor/recipient matching on the incidence of RBC alloimmunization. METHODS: A retrospective comparative study was conducted by reviewing RBC request records for about 36, 000 patients transfused with RBC in the period from 2013 to 2015 in comparison to the similar study conducted on 47, 000 transfused patients in the period from 2005 to 2008. Pre-transfusion serologic testing data were retrieved for analysis. Blood samples with positive antibody screening and positive cross-match were further subjected to antibody identification. All the tests were performed using column agglutination technique (CAT) with ID-cards and reagents from DiaMed in both studies. RESULTS: Irregular RBC alloantibodies were detected in 116 (0. 32 %) out of 36, 000 transfused patients. Multiple transfusions (15. 8 units/patient) were given to 450 patients from which 79 (17. 5 %) had RBC allontibodies. The incidence of RBC alloimmunisation {{in the rest of the}} 35, 550 transfused patients from which 37 had RBC alloantibodies was 0. 10 %. A total of 117 alloantibodies were identified in 96 out of the 116 patients with irregular RBC antibodies. Their specificity was as fallows: anti-E (25. 6 %), -C (6. 0 %), -c (8. 5 %), -e (0. 85 %), -Cw (5. 1 %), -K (12. 8 %), -Fya (10. 2 %), -Fyb (2. 5 %), -Jka (7. 7 %), -Jkb (2. 5 %), -M (9. 4 %), -S (1. 7 %), -s (0. 85 %), -Lua (1. 7 %), -Leb (3. 4 %) and anti-Leb (0. 85 %). Multiple antibodies were identified in 22 of the transfused patients out of which 15 (68. 2 %) received multiple transfusions. Anti-E was the most common antibody found in more of the 50 % of the multiple antibody cases. CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence of RBC alloimmunization in transfused patients decreased from 0. 51 % which was the estimated incidence for the period before the introduction of the extended RBC typing (2005 - 2008) to 0. 32 % (2013 - 2015). This is due to the decreased incidence of RBC alloimmunization in the multiply transfused patients from 33. 9 % to 17. 5 % respectively. The current frequency of anti-E (25. 6 %) and -K (12. 8 %) antibodies in transfused patients are significantly lower than their previous estimated frequencies of 30. 4 % and 24. 0 % respectively, as well as the overall frequency of RBC antibodies to Rh+Kell antigens which decreased from 72. 4 % to 53. 8 %. Extended donor-recipient matching for C, c, E, e and <b>Kell</b> <b>antigens</b> has proved a beneficial effect on the incidence of RBC alloimmunization in multiply transfused patients...|$|R
