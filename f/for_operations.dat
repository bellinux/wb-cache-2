5|$|Due to a {{combination}} of political and strategic decisions, it was almost two years before the battalion went into combat again. In late 1944, in order to free up American troops <b>for</b> <b>operations</b> in the Philippines, Australian forces were directed to take over responsibility <b>for</b> <b>operations</b> around Aitape in New Guinea.

Although basically cut off from resupply, there were around 35,000 Japanese troops in the area, holding the coast past Wewak and into the interior.

5|$|A mockup of the cockpit, center {{fuselage}} and wing {{center section}} was built and was inspected by the BuAer {{in the fall}} 1944. However, the contract for the prototype XTSF-1s was terminated in January 1945. This was due {{to a variety of}} factors, including the Navy's belief that the Grumman engineers and factory were already at capacity producing the F6F Hellcat, the F7F, and the F8F Bearcat, that the XTSF-1 would be too large for practical operations from escort carriers, and because it was believed the Grumman G-70, to be built as the XTB3F, was a better prospect. In addition, the F7F was proving difficult to certify <b>for</b> <b>operations</b> from aircraft carriers, further prejudicing the Navy against the design.|$|E
