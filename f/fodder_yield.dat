40|$|The average {{productivity}} of cowpea {{in the existing}} traditional systems is low due to a complex of biotic and abiotic stresses. The biotic factors include insect pests, parasitic plants, and viral, fungal and bacterial diseases. Concerted efforts are being made to develop improved cowpea varieties with combined resistance to these constraints. Twenty five cowpea lines including two local land-races were grown at three locations {{in the first year}} (2002) and at six locations in the second year (2003) in Nigeria and Niger for field screening for resistance to Bacterial blight. Many of the improved varieties had significantly higher grain and <b>fodder</b> <b>yields</b> than the local checks. There was genotype x environment interactions for grain and <b>fodder</b> <b>yields.</b> About 44 % of the varieties tested were resistant to bacterial blight while 20 % showed moderate resistance and others were susceptible.

40|$|Supported by the CGIAR System-wide Livestock ProgrammeCowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) is an {{important}} food legume and {{an integral part of}} traditional cropping systems in the semi-arid regions of the tropics. The estimated worldwide area under cowpea is about 14 million ha of which West Africa alone accounts for about 9. 3 million ha with annual production of about 2. 9 Mt. Cowpea grains are consumed as food and the haulms are fed to livestock as a nutritious fodder. Farmers often grow a short-duration spreading variety for grain and a long-duration spreading variety for fodder, but the grain and <b>fodder</b> <b>yields</b> are poor due to low yield potential of the spreading varieties and also due to early cessation of rains. Therefore, IITA in collaboration with ILRI has initiated a systematic programme to develop medium-maturing, semi-erect, dual-purpose varieties with higher grain and <b>fodder</b> <b>yields</b> and with enhanced fodder quality. By crossing the late, traditional spreading varieties with improved early, semi-erect varieties, a semi-erect group of medium-maturing, dual-purpose varieties has been developed which yield over 1. 5 t ha− 1 grain and 2. 5 t ha− 1 haulms. Despite the high grain and <b>fodder</b> <b>yields,</b> the haulms of improved dual-purpose varieties have similar crude protein content (17 – 18 %) and dry matter digestibility (64 – 71 %) compared to the local varieties. Controlled sheep feeding experiments have shown an average live weight gain of about 80 g per animal per day with 200 – 400 g per day of cowpea haulms as a supplement to a basal diet of sorghum stover. This was 100 % higher than the average live weight gain of animals fed sorghum fodder alone. These results indicate that improved dual-purpose varieties can play {{an important}} role in enhancing crop–livestock integration in West Africa.

Fodder crops provide cheaper feed for animals and {{play an important role}} in supplying the necessary nutrition to the livestock. Sorghum is a multi-purpose crop and plays a prime role in providing the fodder to the livestock. Most of the work in the past has been focused on increasing the yield of sorghum fodder but little efforts have been made so far on quality aspects. Keeping in view the importance of cyanide problem in deteriorating the quality of sorghum fodder, present study was conducted to evaluate different sorghum genotypes for <b>fodder</b> <b>yield</b> and its nutritional quality attributes under irrigated as well as rainfed condition. The research work comprising of four experiments, was performed on different sorghum genotypes at Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics, Pir Mehr Ali Shah Arid Agriculture University Rawalpindi. Major objectives of evaluation were to select best sorghum genotypes having higher <b>fodder</b> <b>yield</b> and minimum cyanide content and to find out the gene action governing the control of such traits and genetic variability in sorghum genotypes. Sorghum genotypes were examined for different morphological, biochemical and quality parameters under field as well as laboratory conditions. The performance of two sorghum genotypes viz V- 1 and SV- 6 was found excellent for total cyanide content, green <b>fodder</b> <b>yield,</b> total sugar content and crudeprotein under both irrigated as well as rainfed conditions during the two years evaluation. Drought condition resulted in reduction of green <b>fodder</b> <b>yield</b> but cyanide content boosted up under water stress during assessment in two years. Significant G x E interaction was observed during analysis for all the traits under evaluation indicating influence of environment on the performance of sorghum genotypes. Higher phenotypic and genotypic variance estimates than the environmental variance estimates was observed indicating that the variation are genetic in nature and are heritable. <b>Fodder</b> <b>yield</b> and its components showed negative correlation with cyanide content at genotypic and phenotypic levels. <b>Fodder</b> <b>yield,</b> cyanide content and crude protein depicted high heritability and expected genetic advance during study. Partial diallel technique (Circulant Design) given by Kempthorne and Curnow (1964) was utilized to find out the gene action involved in the hereditary transmission of the characters under assessment. The ratio between specific combining ability (SCA) and general combining ability (GCA) variances for all the characters under assessment was greater than unity indicating non additive type of gene action. The parent CVS- 13 and SV- 6 were found good general combiner for <b>fodder</b> <b>yield</b> and cyanide content respectively. Almost all the characters showed significant better parent heterosis for <b>fodder</b> <b>yield</b> and cyanide content during the study. Genetic diversity among ten selected sorghum genotypes was evaluated using ten SSRs primers. Nine primers evaluated successfully and yielded 91 total bands. 23 bands were polymorphic and only two primers depicted polymorphism. The size of scorable bands ranged from 174 bp to 600 bp. The efficiency of SSRs primers to amplify sorghum genotype ranged from 7 to 10. Dendrogram showed that three sorghum genotypes i. e.

Further research on response of mottgrass to N exceeding dose of 120 N ha - 1 is still needed...|$|E
40|$|Five {{institutions}} including ILCA/ILRI, {{collaborated on}} the joint Vertisol Project (JVP) starting in 1986 for the sustainable use of Vertisol soils in Ethiopia. The improved soil drainage {{from the use}} of the broadbed maker (BBM) plough is one component of a technology package, that together with improved crop varieties, fertilisers and credit access can improve the well-being of farmers in Ethiopia by increasing grain and <b>fodder</b> <b>yields.</b> Several studies had been conducted previously in relation to the adoption of this technology. However, this ex post impact assessment was the first study undertaken since the research programme began and the BBM technology was developed for Ethiopia in 1986, to be focused on the impacts of the technology following adoption. The purpose of this study of the BBM is to assess quantitatively the returns to the research investment in this technology. The assessment was conducted using economic surplus methodology...|$|R

ICPL 84001 and ICPL 8357, {{which are}} {{resistant}} to Fusarium wilt and sterility mosaic, gave similar yields to the susceptible control cv. C 11. (2. 9 - 3. 0 t/ha in 1984 and 1. 7 - 1. 8 t/ha in 1985). In 1984 at Los Baños, Philippines, the Heliothis-tolerant C. cajan cv. ICPL 84060 and ICP 3009 -EB- 4 -EB gave seed yields of 3. 2 and 2. 7 t/ha, resp., and <b>fodder</b> <b>yields</b> of 18. 1 and 23. 8 t/ha compared with 2. 5 t seed/ha and 16. 3 t fodder/ha for the control cv. ICPL 295. In the Pigeonpea Observation Nursery at Suwan Farm, Thailand, the medium-duration cv. were the best adapted of all maturity groups in 1982 and cv. ICP 8863 yielded 5 t/ha compared with 2. 1 t/ha for the local cv. ...|$|R
40|$|Several plant {{diseases}} reduce grain and <b>fodder</b> <b>yields</b> of sorghum (Sorg/jum bicolor) and its stover quality (Bandyopadhyay et al. 2001). Participatory rural appraisal studies In India by Rama Devi et al. (2000) Indicated that sale of crop residues to perl-urban milk producers accounted for approximately 50 % {{of the income}} from sorghum cropping In rural areas of the Deccan Plateau of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra, and diseased residues command much lower price In the fodder market. Adverse effects of foliar and panicle diseases on {{quality and quantity of}} sorghum grain, fodder and residues have recently been reported (Bandyopadhyay et al. 2000, 2001). Most sorghum diseases can be effectively managed through host-plant resistance. The objective {{of this study was to}} Identify resistance to multiple diseases in the selected agronomic elite landrace accessions and breeding lines of sorghum. In this article we report both agronomic features and multiple disease resistance of some of the accessions for their possible use in resistance breeding program...|$|R
