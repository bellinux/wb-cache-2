On May4,2009, a week before the season one finale, Fox renewed Fringe for a second season, giving it a full season pick-up of 22 episodes. The network's {{president}} of entertainment, Kevin Reilly, explained [...] "Fringe proved to be a notable addition to our schedule all season and <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>has</b> fans buzzing as it builds to a fantastic season finale." ...|$|E
500|$|Asked in a {{separate}} interview about the overall process of composing the music {{and how it is}} used in the episode, Djawadi revealed [...] "I sit with David and Dan and we do what's called a spotting session where we watch the entire episode and then discuss when music should start and stop. Everybody's very involved with that. And it constantly gets played with. What I love about Game of Thrones is that the positioning of the music is so well done, because it's not overdone. When the music cuts in, <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>has</b> something to say." [...] "Light of the Seven" [...] reached No. 1 on Billboard's Spotify Viral 50 chart on its release.|$|E
500|$|American Pagan studies scholar Aidan A. Kelly {{similarly}} rejected Liddell's claims. Kelly highlighted that whereas Liddell {{had claimed}} that Gardnerian Wicca had adopted {{the concept of}} a female coven leader from French and Scandinavian witch covens, the historical evidence clearly showed that Gardner developed {{the concept of a}} coven being led by a high priestess during the late 1950s, thus disproving Liddell's assertions. He noted that Liddell's claim that Crowley wrote Gardner's Book of Shadows [...] "cannot possibly be true" [...] because Crowley died before the Book was written. Kelly believed that either Liddell or his Elders had purposely created a [...] "phony history" [...] in order {{to hide the fact that}} Gardner had invented Wicca in its entirety in the early 1950s. Similarly, in a 2014 article about Pickingill in The Cauldron, Richard Ward argued that Liddell's claims did not stand up under scrutiny, and that they had simply been made in an attempt to promote claims regarding the existence of a [...] "pre-Gardnerian tradition" [...] of witchcraft. Liddell has specifically denied any charges that he was deliberately falsifying claims to make Gardnerian Wicca appear to have an older pedigree than <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>has.</b>|$|E

500|$|After the reveal of the film's full cast, many {{outlets and}} fans began {{referring}} to the film as [...] "Avengers 2.5", given the variety and ensemble nature of the cast, usually reserved for the Avengers films, {{and the fact that}} the film no longer felt like a Captain America-centric one, as with The Winter Soldier. In response to this, Feige said, [...] "What's fun about Civil War though is, as you know from the comics, it's a very simple story. And <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>has</b> to be, to accommodate that many players. It's very much a Captain America movie and it's very much a sequel to the Winter Soldier in ways I don't think people .... It's a very simple structure that allows you to have these amazing character interactions in a way that I don't think becomes overwhelming." [...] Feige also revealed that Hope van Dyne / Wasp was in an original draft of the film, after receiving the Wasp costume at the end of Ant-Man, but was cut because [...] "there are so many characters in Civil War that we didn't want to do her a disservice," [...] saying Marvel was [...] "saving" [...] the character for a better environment to reveal van Dyne in the Wasp costume for the first time and see [...] "her dynamic with Scott [...] in a way it could play out".|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the reports}} that Alfie would {{discover}} the affair, {{it was reported that}} several different storyline endings had been filmed, but that Wallace had been told the identity of Kat's lover, with a show source saying: [...] "The time felt right to finally tell Jessie, but she is still {{one of only a handful}} of people who knows the answer to the question on everyone's lips. [...] Lorraine [...] was adamant this story was going to stay quiet for as long as possible. She has done everything in her power to let it play out on screen with total secrecy behind the scenes. It's created a real buzz as everyone's been trying to figure out who Kat's been bedding. Up until now, none of the cast were in the know, not even her on-screen lover. <b>It</b> <b>really</b> <b>has</b> been that cloak and dagger. Richie revealed that Wallace had found not knowing the identity of Kat's lover [...] "frustrating" [...] but that she was [...] "torn between whether she wanted to know or not, because if she had known, she was frightened she might give it away by just a look", while Richie himself was happy not to know, [...] "because Alfie was in the same position", adding that both actors were [...] "happy to let it play out, though, because Kat flirts outrageously with all three Branning brothers, so we wanted the audience to make up their own minds about who the mystery lover was." ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{believe it}} is the manner, after all, of the [...] "Psalm of Life" [...] that has made it so strangely popular.

They say so, and they think so: but the poem {{is not nearly as}} good as a sermon; it is not even coherent. But <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>has</b> an original cadence of its own, with its double rhymes; and the pleasure of this cadence has combined, with a belief that they are being edified, to make readers out of number consider the [...] "Psalms of Life" [...] a masterpiece.

60|$|We {{took a long}} detour through {{somewhat}} easier roads, till we came to {{a breach}} or chasm in the valley, from which we saw our friend the White Horse once more. At least, we thought it was our friend the White Horse; but after a little inquiry we discovered to our astonishment that it was another friend and another horse. Along the leaning flanks of the same fair valley there was (it seemed) another white horse; as rude and as clean, as ancient and as modern, as the first. This, at least, I thought must be the aboriginal White Horse of Alfred, which I had always heard associated with his name. And yet before we had driven into Wantage and seen King Alfred's quaint grey statue in the sun, we had seen yet a third white horse. And the third white horse was so hopelessly unlike a horse that we were sure that it was genuine. The final and original white horse, the white horse of the White Horse Vale, has that big, babyish quality that truly belongs to our remotest ancestors. <b>It</b> <b>really</b> <b>has</b> the prehistoric, preposterous quality of Zulu or New Zealand native drawings. This at least was surely made by our fathers when they were barely men; long before they were civilized men.|$|E
6000|$|... 180 The writer last quoted {{says that}} the {{valuation}} of chances by [...] comparing {{the number of cases}} in which the event occurs with the [...] number in which it does not occur, “would generally be wholly [...] erroneous,” and “is not the true theory of probability.” It is at [...] least that which forms the foundation of insurance, and of all those [...] calculations of chances in the business of life which experience so [...] abundantly verifies. The reason which the reviewer gives for [...] rejecting the theory is, that it “would regard an event as certain [...] which had hitherto never failed; which is exceedingly far from the [...] truth, even for {{a very large number of}} constant successes.” This is [...] not a defect in a particular theory, but in any theory of chances. [...] No principle of evaluation can provide for such a case as that which [...] the reviewer supposes. If an event has never once failed, in a [...] number of trials sufficient to eliminate chance, <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>has</b> all [...] the certainty which can be given by an empirical law; it is [...] certain during the continuance of the same collocation of causes [...] which existed during the observations.
