5|$|Purgatory is a {{temporary}} condition for the purification of souls who, although destined for Heaven, are not fully detached from sin and thus cannot enter Heaven <b>immediately.</b> <b>In</b> Purgatory, the soul suffers, and is purged and perfected. Souls in purgatory may be aided in reaching heaven by the prayers of the faithful on earth and by the intercession of saints.|$|E

This was part of a wider trend from around the late 12th or 13th century onwards for castle gateways to be strongly defended.|$|E

5|$|Altar 19 {{was buried}} in the fill of the final version of Temple 33, <b>immediately</b> <b>in</b> front of the second version of the summit shrine. It was badly damaged and was broken into several pieces, and the {{majority}} of a sculpture depicting a seated person was chipped away. The three fragments were buried together in a way that paired the altar with the buried Stela 31; this may have maintained a relationship between the monuments that existed when they were originally on public display. The altar was crafted from limestone and is now in the site museum at Tikal. It has been dated to approximately AD 445.|$|E
5|$|Both {{of these}} {{investigations}} began almost <b>immediately.</b> <b>In</b> {{the days following}} the tornado, Tinker's meteorologists Major Ernest J. Fawbush and Captain Robert C. Miller investigated surface and upper-air weather data from this and past tornado outbreaks, hoping {{to be able to}} identify conditions which were favorable for tornadoes. By March 24, they had compiled several possible tornado indicators, and decided it would be difficult, but possible, to identify large tornado threat areas in the future.|$|E

5|$|Brock {{arrived in}} Canada {{with the rest}} of the 49th foot and was {{initially}} assigned to Montreal. Almost <b>immediately,</b> <b>in</b> 1804 he was faced with one of the primary problems in Canada: desertion. Seven soldiers stole a boat and fled across the river (and border) into the United States. Despite having no jurisdiction on American soil, Brock sent a party across the border in pursuit and the men were captured.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the ferocity}} of the night fighting, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British {{destroyer}} forces and reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1June. The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later, where Rheinland refueled and re-armed. Meanwhile, her three sisters stood out in the roadstead in defensive positions. Over {{the course of the}} battle, the ship had fired thirty-five 28cm (11in) shells and twenty-six 15cm (5.9in) rounds. The two hits from Black Prince had killed 10 men and wounded 20. Repair work followed <b>immediately</b> <b>in</b> Wilhelmshaven and was completed by 10 June.|$|E

5|$|In Retford, MacMillan was {{introduced}} to ballet by a local dance teacher, Jean Thomas. He had already had lessons in Scottish dancing in Dunfermline and tap dancing in Great Yarmouth, and he took to ballet <b>immediately.</b> <b>In</b> 1942 his mother died, which caused him acute and lasting distress. His father was a distant figure, and the boy's only close family relationship was with an elder sister. His obituarist in The Times suggests that {{the feeling of being}} an outsider, displayed in many of MacMillan's ballets, had its roots in his childhood.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{plans for}} the British Library {{required}} demolition of {{an integral part of}} Bloomsbury – a seven-acre swathe of streets <b>immediately</b> <b>in</b> front of the Museum, so that the Library could be situated directly opposite.

One member of the development team stated that the mod's cancellation was to prevent future legal issues.|$|E

He added, however, that he would have regretted it if he had not decided to run for the office. By midnight, unofficial results from the Electoral Commission gave Türk a lead of 68% vs. 32%. Türk won in all eight electoral units, with Peterle narrowly winning in only four of 88 electoral districts. Together with {{the second round of the}} election, a referendum on a law providing for the nationalization of citizens' share in the major national insurance company was held as well. Nearly three quarters of the votes were cast against the law.|$|E
5|$|Recruiting for {{the relief}} force began <b>immediately</b> <b>in</b> England on a {{voluntary}} basis and would ultimately include men from every regiment of the British Army, as well as all the dominions. The North Russian Relief Force (NRRF) subsequently formed two brigades—one under the command of Brigadier General Lionel Sadlier-Jackson, and the other under Brigadier General George Grogan, and both under the overall command of Major General Edmund Ironside. Sadlier-Jackson's brigade included over 4,000 men, including the 45th and 46th Battalions, the Royal Fusiliers, supporting machine gunners from the 201st Machine Gun Battalion, as well as artillery, signallers and engineers. Grogan’s brigade was primarily drawn from battalions of the Worcestershire Regiment.|$|E
5|$|The Austro-Hungarian Navy's U-boat fleet at the {{beginning}} of World War I consisted of six largely experimental submarines, two of which were not operational. When it became apparent that the war would not be a short one, Austria-Hungary moved to bolster their U-boat fleet by seizing the plans for the Danish Havmanden class submarines, three of which had been built at Whitehead’s in Fiume. Although the Austro-Hungarian Navy was not happy with the design, which was largely obsolete, it was the only design for which plans were available and which could be begun <b>immediately</b> <b>in</b> domestic shipyards. The Austro-Hungarian Navy unenthusiastically placed orders for four boats on 27 March 1915.|$|E

The last body, a caretaker killed at the Exhibition Grounds, was not recovered until the summer of 1919. An additional 9,000 were injured. 1,630 homes were destroyed in the explosion and fires, and another 12,000 damaged; roughly 6,000 people were left homeless and 25,000 had insufficient shelter. The city's industrial sector was in large part gone, with many workers among the casualties and the dockyard heavily damaged.|$|E
