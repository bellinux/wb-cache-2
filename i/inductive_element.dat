50|$|Snubbers are {{frequently}} used in electrical systems with an inductive load where the sudden interruption of current flow {{leads to a}} sharp rise in voltage across the current switching device, in accordance with Faraday's law. This transient can {{be a source of}} electromagnetic interference (EMI) in other circuits. Additionally, if the voltage generated across the device is beyond what the device is intended to tolerate, it may damage or destroy it. The snubber provides a short-term alternative current path around the current switching device so that the <b>inductive</b> <b>element</b> may be discharged more safely and quietly. Inductive elements are often unintentional, but arise from the current loops implied by physical circuitry. While current switching is everywhere, snubbers will generally only be required where a major current path is switched, such as in power supplies. Snubbers are also often used to prevent arcing across the contacts of relays and switches and the electrical interference and welding/sticking of the contacts that can occur (see also arc suppression).|$|E
