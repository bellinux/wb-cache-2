25|$|In 1993, Sharif {{survived a}} serious {{constitutional}} crises {{when it was}} reported that Sharif developed serious issues over the authority with another national conservative president Ghulam Ishaq Khan. Before 1993 Parliamentary election, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan on 18 April 1993, {{with the support of the}} Pakistan Army, used his reserve powers (58-2b) (See 8th Amendment) to dissolve the National Assembly, the lower house. Khan appointed Mir Balakh Sher as the interim prime minister. When the news reached to Sharif, he forcefully rejected to accept this act and moved to Supreme Court of Pakistan, an apex court in Pakistan. On 26 May 1993, Sharif returned to power after the Supreme Court ruled the Presidential Order as unconstitutional and reconstituted the National Assembly on its immediate effect. The Court ruled, 10–1, that the president could dissolve the assembly only if a constitutional breakdown had occurred and that the government's incompetence or corruption was irrelevant. Justice Sajjad Ali Shah was the only <b>dissenting</b> <b>judge,</b> he later became 13th Chief Justice of Pakistan.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>dissenting</b> <b>judges</b> {{found that}} the pith and {{substance}} of the impugned provision was to hinder any provincial attempt to use the long-gun registry data, which falls primarily into the provincial property and civil rights power. The <b>dissenting</b> <b>judges</b> undertook an ancillary doctrine analysis, finding that section 29 of the ELRA encroached significantly on provincial powers, since it [...] "compromises the creation and the usefulness of a future Quebec firearms registry", and that such an encroachment was not necessary or integral to the overall legislative scheme. The <b>dissenting</b> <b>judges</b> thus would have found section 29 of the ELRA unconstitutional, since it amounted to unilateral federal destruction of the registry data without first offering it to the provinces, and would have declared it invalid.|$|R

500|$|The {{judgment}} {{has been}} called a [...] "landmark ruling" [...] by the Law Society Gazette, with lawyers saying that the decision was expected but long overdue. [...] One barrister, Clare Montgomery QC, looked at the implications for other participants in the legal process, commenting that the [...] "process of whittling away the scope of the immunity" [...] that they have [...] "appears to be far from over". Other commentators were concerned that the decision would lead to {{reduction in the number of}} expert witnesses prepared to become involved with some particularly sensitive areas, such as child abuse cases. [...] Lady Hale, the other <b>dissenting</b> <b>judge,</b> said that changing the law in this way was [...] "irresponsible" [...] and said that the position should instead be considered by the Law Commission and Parliament.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>dissenting</b> <b>judges</b> {{said that}} the burial {{disregard}} both international and domestic laws in regards to give justice to victims {{of human rights abuses}} during Marcos' term. The Philippine government was noted to have an obligation to provide compensations to the victims, both monetary and non-monetary, the latter of which includes symbolic reparation. The burial of Marcos at the Heroes' Cemetery was deemed by the dissenters as contrary to symbolic reparation entitled to the victims. By allowing the burial, the <b>dissenting</b> <b>judges</b> says that President Duterte was [...] "encouraging impunity". Marcos was described by the <b>dissenting</b> <b>judges</b> as [...] "a dictator forced out of office and into exile after causing twenty years of political, economic, and social havoc in the country".|$|R
5000|$|However, the <b>dissenting</b> <b>judges</b> {{noted that}} [...] "the {{absence of a}} legal barrier to the {{transfer}} of the data {{does not necessarily mean that}} Quebec has proven that it is entitled to obtain them through the courts" [...] and held that Quebec had not proven that it was entitled to the data. The <b>dissenting</b> <b>judges</b> would have allowed the federal and Quebec governments to instead negotiate their own agreement as to data destruction and termination of the partnership.|$|R

2500|$|A and Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department [...] UKHL 17, the {{majority}} of the House of Lords decided that the detention without trial under the ATCSA 2001 was discriminatory to non-British nationals, and therefore incompatible under Art.14 ECHR. A declaration of incompatibility was issued under s.4 HRA 1998. Lord Hoffmann was the only <b>dissenting</b> <b>judge</b> to hold that the whole detention without trial idea was incompatible with the right to a trial under Art.6, and that the derogation was unacceptable, because there was no [...] "threat {{to the life of the}} nation". He argued strongly that it would be wrong to suggest, with {{the majority}}'s view that discrimination was the problem, that the government should be allowed to lock up all Britons alike.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>dissenting</b> <b>judge,</b> Judge N. Randy Smith, {{noted in}} his dissent that states do legitimately {{prohibit}} sexual relationships condemned by society such as incest, bigamy, and bestiality, and impose age limits for marriage without violating constitutional rights. He stated that [...] "gays and lesbians are not a suspect or quasi-suspect class" [...] and are thus not entitled to the courts' increased scrutiny of laws that affect them. He wrote, [...] "The family structure of two committed biological parents—one man and one woman—is the optimal partnership for raising children." [...] He also said that governments have a legitimate interest in [...] "a responsible procreation theory, justifying the inducement of marital recognition only for opposite-sex couples" [...] because only they can have children. He urged judicial restraint, that the justices should refrain from striking down Proposition 8.|$|E
2500|$|On Friday, May 4, a U.S. District Court Judge {{issued a}} Temporary Restraining Order precluding the State of Tennessee from {{executing}} Workman until a preliminary injunction hearing assesses {{the constitutionality of}} Tennessee's revised procedure for administering lethal injections. However, this restraining order was vacated by a two-to-one decision of the U.S. Court for Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on Monday, May 7 and Workman was moved to death watch. The decision to vacate the restraining order was stridently criticized, on both procedural and substantive grounds, by the <b>dissenting</b> <b>Judge</b> Cole. Judge Cole wrote, [...] "The majority's opinion rests on a profound jurisdictional defect: There is no appealable order before this Court. The district court issued a temporary restraining order, not a preliminary injunction [...] [...] [...] The district court's TRO cannot be magically transformed into a preliminary injunction, which is an appealable order, even though the State {{and a majority of}} this Court may wish it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On November 6, the Sixth Circuit ruled 2–1 that Kentucky's ban on {{same-sex}} marriage does {{not violate the}} constitution. It said it was bound by the U.S. Supreme Court's 1972 action in a similar case, Baker v. Nelson, which dismissed a same-sex couple's marriage claim [...] "for want of a substantial federal question." [...] Writing for the majority, Judge Jeffrey Sutton also dismissed the arguments made on behalf of same-sex couples in this case: [...] "Not one of the plaintiffs' theories, however, makes the case for constitutionalizing the definition of marriage and for removing the issue from the place {{it has been since}} the founding: in the hands of state voters." [...] <b>Dissenting,</b> <b>Judge</b> Martha Craig Daughtrey wrote: [...] "Because the correct result is so obvious, one is tempted to speculate that the majority has purposefully taken the contrary position to create the circuit split regarding the legality of {{same-sex marriage}} that could prompt a grant of certiorari by the Supreme Court and an end to the uncertainty of status and the interstate chaos that the current discrepancy in state laws threatens." ...|$|E

5000|$|The <b>dissenting</b> <b>judges,</b> led by Karakatsanis J, {{would have}} allowed the appeal. They found the search unconstitutional, holding that warrantless search of a cell phone {{incident}} to arrest is prima facie unreasonable, as it is not authorized by law. The <b>dissenting</b> <b>judges</b> found a high expectation of privacy in cell phones, recognizing the immense data storage and retention capabilities of modern cell phones, the volume of metadata generated by cell phones, {{and the possibility that}} a search of a cell phone might access data stored in the cloud, not on the cell phone itself. The <b>dissenting</b> <b>judges</b> noted the law enforcement objectives set out by the majority but suggested that they would be more fairly balanced with privacy interests given a modification of the common-law framework allowing warrantless cell phone searches incident to arrest only in exigent circumstances. Exigent circumstances would require of law enforcement a [...] "reasonable basis to suspect a search may prevent an imminent threat to safety or... reasonable grounds to believe that the imminent loss or destruction of evidence may be prevented by a warrantless search". Under the dissenting judges' modification, the objective of protecting officer safety would justify a warrantless search only if the officer had a reasonable suspicion that the phone had been used to generate a threat to his safety. Likewise, the preservation of evidence objective would justify a warrantless search only in those cases where it was reasonable to believe that evidence was being destroyed and that a cell phone search could prevent this destruction. In any other, non-exigent circumstances, the <b>dissenting</b> <b>judges</b> held that a warrant would be required for the search.|$|R
