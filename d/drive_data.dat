On the other hand, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) has gained attention for their potential supports and attractive solutions such as environment monitoring, bio-median acknowledgment, healthcare monitoring, industrial automation, etc. Additionally, our virtual groups and social networks are in main role of information sharing. However, this sensor <b>driven</b> <b>data</b> is not available to community groups or cloud environment for general purpose research or utilization yet. If we reduce the gap between real and virtual world by adding this WSN <b>driven</b> <b>data</b> to cloud environment and virtual communities by providing censor driven contents to general researchers, and it can gain a remarkable attention from all over, by giving us the benefit in various sectors. Collaboration between WSN and the cloud environment can achieve this. We have proposed an integrated Publish/Subscribe (pub/sub) -based middleware service for the cloud platform to collaborate with WSN. This collaboration will provide resource, service, and storage with sensor <b>driven</b> <b>data</b> to the community. Furthermore, we have proposed a content-based event matching algorithm to analyze subscriptions and publish proper contents easily. We have evaluated our algorithm which sows better performance comparing with previously proposed algorithms. Keywords-Cloud computing; WSN; middleware service; event matching; pub/sub I...|$|R

Changes in the retinal microcirculation are seen with aging, exposure to air pollutionand may indicate cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and atherosclerosis.
