40|$|Traditional {{measures}} of concentration of financial market activities do not adequately reflect an economy¡¦s {{status as an}} international financial centre (IFC). In this paper, we construct alternative measures that better capture the ability of an IFC to attract capital flows and international demand for its financial services, {{as well as its}} attractiveness as a place for international financial institutions to congregate. We also explore the determinants of the competitiveness of IFCs in an analytical and empirical framework. Our findings suggest that, in addition to the pull factors of the IFC, push or demand factors from the economies importing financial services from the IFC are also important. The rise of Mainland China represents a potentially important push factor for the demand for <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> <b>exports</b> from Hong Kong, and hence its status as an IFC.

40|$|The {{sterling}} effective {{exchange rate}} depreciated by around 25 % between mid- 2007 and early 2009.

40|$|Australia’s {{financial}} connectedness {{with the}} Asia-Pacific region lags behind its deepening economic, diplomatic and cultural {{ties with the}} region, according to this report by the Australian Centre for Financial Studies. The report finds that while the Asia-Pacific region represents roughly two-thirds of Australia’s global trading relationships, it still accounts for less than one-third of Australia’s financial relationships. Australia’s <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> <b>exports</b> and two-way investment profile remain oriented toward the ‘traditional’ trading partners of the United States, United Kingdom and New Zealand, even as four of Australia’s top five trading partners now lie in the Asia-Pacific.   The report points out that financial services is the largest single industrial segment of the Australian economy, a major employer and the largest source of corporate tax revenue. The industry is also a major exporter – of a magnitude not often understood in the community. The value of Australia’s exports of financial services is in fact larger than {{the value of its}} tourism exports, and more than double the value of its education exports. High barriers to services trade and cross-border investment in Asia may be inhibiting Australian firms and investors from growing their connections with the region.   This is likely to shift in 2015 with the gradual opening of China’s capital account; the realisation of a regionally-integrated ASEAN Economic Community; and the conclusion of three recent free trade agreements with China, Japan and South Korea. “All of these events will change {{the way in which the}} Australian financial system interacts with a rising Asia,” according to Amy Auster.   A key finding of the report is that many aspects of financial integration are not well-researched or understood. The benefits and costs of financial integration have not been closely examined, and the data on trade in financial services is poor. Policymakers, regulators and practitioners lack a strong evidence base from which to make decisions of vital importance to the entire economy.   Authors: Amy Auster, Deputy Director, and Martin Foo, Research Officer, of the Australian Centre for Financial Studie...|$|E

To achieve the main goal, the following tasks have been set: (1) to propose an approach to strategic planning in the sphere of <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> export; (2) to define and use mathematical methods for studying the factors which influence export of financial services; (3) arising from regression analysis and banking specialist interviewing, to find out the factors exerting the most influence on export of financial services; (4) basing on the ascertained factors, to offer a standard of estimating potential of countries in <b>export</b> of <b>financial</b> <b>services.</b> Analysis methods utilized in this study were: regression analysis, experts interviewing and the analysis of researches in the field of <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> and strategic management.

40|$|In late 2008 {{and early}} 2009, the G 8 and the G 20 {{pressured}} remaining non-cooperative jurisdictions with sanctions if {{they failed to}} commit to the OECD standards of transparency and exchange of information for tax purposes and sign 12 agreements that met these standards. Leading up to this event was the continued work of the OECD to construct a treaty network to combat tax evasion by means of tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs). In this thesis, I investigate if the pressure to implement the network of tax information exchange agreements reduces tax evasion activities in jurisdictions providing banking secrecy. To measure {{the effect of these}} tax information exchange agreements I use the value of service charges banks and other financial institutions in a country apply to their foreign clients that own financial assets there. These charges are for each country included in the category <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> <b>export</b> in the Balance of Payments (BOP) data set. And this is the data used to analyse potential effects. In other words, I use <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> <b>export</b> as a proxy for foreign financial assets. The statistical software package used in this thesis is Stata 14. 1. There are two methods that I use to estimate an effect of the pressure to commit to the OECD standards and sign 12 agreements that meet the standards. The first approach is the fixed-effects (FE) model, and it is used to measure the change in <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> <b>export</b> as a percent of goods and <b>services</b> <b>export</b> for all countries that goes from being uncooperative to cooperative in exchanging tax information. The overall effect on the data set is then measured by this method. The second approach is called the synthetic control method and is used on the data to estimate a potential effect on an individual country's <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> <b>export.</b> I apply it to Switzerland as it historically has been the place to hide financial assets, with a banking secrecy law enacted in 1935, and an almost complete hegemony over the international wealth-management market until the beginning of the 1980 s. By using the fixed-effect model and, in this context, the previously unused Balance of Payments data set, I find evidence that committing to the OECD standards and signing at least 12 tax information exchange agreements to the OECD standards has no significant effect on the cumulative amount of foreign financial assets. I theorise that this is a result of heterogeneous effects, caused by spillover effects of foreign financial assets from highly cooperative jurisdictions to less cooperative jurisdictions. By using the synthetic control method on an individual country known to provide banking secrecy, Switzerland, I find a large decrease in foreign financial assets from committing to the OECD standards and signing tax information exchange agreements to the OECD standards. This strengthens the theory of heterogeneous effects from the fixed-effects model, as a reduction in Switzerland necessitates a similar opposite effect in other countries that have committed to the OECD standards and signed at least 12 agreements that meet the standards. The concerns that the bilateral agreement network does not cover enough country pairs to effectively prevent tax evasion seems to be valid. The network for each country is far from complete, and {{a large part of the}} world is completely left out because of administrative costs of implementing and enforcing agreements. This continues to provide the opportunity for a tax evader to transfer financial assets, with little risk of detection, to countries not covered by an agreement with the home country of the tax evader...|$|R

40|$|Key points 	The {{total value}} of Australian <b>service</b> <b>exports</b> was 57 billion in 2013 - 14 and about 17 per cent of total <b>exports.</b> The six <b>services</b> sectors covered in this study — tourism, education, <b>financial</b> <b>services,</b> {{professional}} services, information technology and health services — accounted for around 85 per cent of the {{total value of}} <b>service</b> <b>exports.</b> 	 		The total value of <b>service</b> <b>exports</b> from all sectors has doubled (in real terms) over the past two decades. 		Rising household incomes, particularly in some countries in Asia, have been an important driver of increasing global demand for services. Visitors from Asia account for much of the growth in Australian tourism and education exports over the past decade. 		The costs of <b>exporting</b> <b>services</b> have fallen due, in part, to lower airfares and the development of internet tools including email, online video and audio calls, and electronic payment systems. 	 	 	The priority for the Australian Government should be policy reform that promotes competition and provides incentives for domestic firms, including in services sectors, to innovate and lift their productivity. Specific reforms to reduce domestic barriers to <b>service</b> <b>exports</b> include: 	 		implementing visa processing arrangements for short-term visitors and international students that are no more onerous than is necessary to meet a single policy objective of immigration integrity 		liberalising air services arrangements for the major gateway cities of Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth and, following this, Sydney — unless a published assessment shows the costs of liberalising access to Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport would outweigh the benefits to the community 		simplifying Australia 2 ̆ 7 s regime of withholding taxes through greater uniformity in the rate applied to different types of investment and reducing the range of exemptions 		implementing consistent screening thresholds for Foreign Investment Review Board examination of foreign investment proposals across investors from different countries. 	 	 	International barriers to services trade can be costly. 	 		Restrictions on setting up a commercial presence abroad affect the education, health and professional service sectors, but are particularly costly for <b>exports</b> of <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> in key markets in Asia such as China, India and Indonesia. 		Licensing requirements and regulation are used to maintain standards of quality, consumer protection and safety but can impose unnecessary restrictions on services trade, particularly for professional services. 		All services providers seeking to export rely on the ability to move data across borders, making data restrictions costly. The <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> sector can be especially affected by restrictions on data flows, as are exporters who rely on cloud computing services. 	 	 	Realising benefits from trade depends on governments committing to further reducing barriers at and behind the border. No one mechanism will be sufficient to address international barriers to services trade. 	 		Trade agreements can be a precursor to market access, including establishing a commercial presence abroad, but realised benefits may be limited without supplementary measures, such as mutual recognition. The Australian Government can help by putting in place a framework in trade agreements for developing mutual recognition agreements. 		The Australian Government is well-placed to help facilitate cross-border data flows through trade negotiations and other international forums, and as leader of a project on harmonising standards for the movement of data across APEC economies.
