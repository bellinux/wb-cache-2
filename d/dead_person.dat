5|$|Lower-class {{citizens}} used common {{forms of}} funerary art—including shabti figurines (to perform any labor {{that might be}} required of the <b>dead</b> <b>person</b> in the afterlife), models of the scarab beetle and funerary texts—which they believed would protect them in the afterlife. During the Middle Kingdom, miniature wooden or clay models depicting scenes from everyday life became popular additions to tombs. In an attempt to duplicate {{the activities of the}} living in the afterlife, these models show laborers, houses, boats and even military formations which are scale representations of the ideal ancient Egyptian afterlife.|$|E
5|$|Despite the warlike {{customs of}} the Vikings, {{there was an}} element of fear {{surrounding}} death and what belonged to it. If the deceased was a revenant or draugr, such a sight was frightful and ominous and usually it was interpreted {{as a sign that}} additional family members would die. It was first and foremost in times of starvation, when communities were struck with a series of misfortunes, that rumours about revenants began to flourish. The sagas tell of drastic precautions being taken after a revenant had appeared. The <b>dead</b> <b>person</b> had to die anew; a stake could be put through the corpse, or its head might be cut off in order to stop the deceased from finding its way back to the living.|$|E
5|$|It {{was common}} to leave gifts with the deceased. Both {{men and women}} {{received}} grave goods, even if the corpse was to be burnt on a pyre. A Norseman could also be buried with a loved one or house thrall, or cremated together on a funeral pyre. The amount {{and the value of}} the goods depended on which social group the <b>dead</b> <b>person</b> came from. It was important to bury the dead in the right way so that he could join the afterlife with the same social standing that he had had in life, and to avoid becoming a homeless soul that wandered eternally.|$|E

5000|$|...Even {{though the}} burial jars {{are similar to}} that of the pottery found in Kulaman Plateau, Southern Mindanao and many more {{excavation}} sites here in the Philippines, what makes the Maitum jars uniquely different is how the anthropomorphic features depict “specific <b>dead</b> <b>persons</b> whose remains they guard”.|$|R

25|$|John Chrysostom (c. 347–407) mockingly {{attributes}} to the Marcionites {{of the late}} 4th century a similar practice: if one of their followers who was being prepared for baptism died before receiving baptism, the dead person's corpse was addressed with the question whether he wished to be baptized, whereupon another answered affirmatively and was baptized for the <b>dead</b> <b>person.</b>|$|E
25|$|Munkar and Nakir: {{the angels}} who test {{the faith of}} the dead in their graves. They ask the soul of the <b>dead</b> <b>person</b> questions.

If the soul passes the questions, he will have a {{pleasant}} time in the grave until the Day of Judgement.|$|E
25|$|Pocong or hantu bungkus (wrapped ghost) is a ghost {{wrapped in}} a white burial shroud. When a <b>dead</b> <b>person</b> is buried, the shroud is {{supposed}} to be untied. If it remains tied at the top, the spirit is restless and the body becomes a pocong. Because they are tied at the feet, they move around by hopping {{in a manner similar to}} the Chinese jiangshi. In some depictions, they are able to fly.|$|E

25|$|In December 897, Pope Theodore II (897) {{convened a}} synod that annulled the Cadaver Synod, rehabilitated Formosus, and ordered that his body, {{which had been}} {{recovered}} from the Tiber, be reburied in Saint Peter's Basilica in pontifical vestments. In 898, John IX (898—900) also nullified the Cadaver Synod, convening two synods (one in Rome, one in Ravenna) which confirmed the findings of Theodore II's synod, ordered the acta of the Cadaver Synod destroyed, excommunicated seven cardinals {{who were involved in}} the Cadaver Synod, and prohibited any future trial of a <b>dead</b> <b>person.</b>|$|E

She apologizes to Jeongsu Nam, who (in the form of an owl) has been magically cursing Sara Doryeong. The owl dies, and Sara Doryeong gives Jacheong Bi his third {{daughter}} and the Hwansaengkkot. Because Jacheong Bi is a woman and does not want to have an affair with another woman, Jacheong Bi flees with the Hwansaengkkot and brings Jeongsu Nam back to life. However, Jacheong bi's parents consider it evil to make a <b>dead</b> <b>person</b> be alive again, and chase Jacheong Bi away again.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, the Robinson Hill {{case was}} the subject of Murder in Texas, a {{television}} film featuring Farrah Fawcett as Robinson Hill. It concurs with Kurth's theory that Hill may have faked his death, suggesting that he arranged for someone else to be killed in his place. The journalist Jerry Buck noted in an article preceding the film's debut on NBC that the face of the shooting victim had been battered and that there were anomalies in the autopsy report, notably that Hill had a different eye color from that recorded for the <b>dead</b> <b>person.</b> Buck also wrote that Hill was in financial difficulties with the Internal Revenue Service in 1972 and facing a murder case against him. Sightings of Hill had also been reported in Mexico and New York City.|$|E

25|$|Emmett J. Roe, {{owner of}} Imperial Foods Products Inc.; his son Brad, who was {{operations}} {{manager for the}} company; and plant manager James N. Hair surrendered on March 13, 1992, and were charged with non-negligent manslaughter. There was no trial. On September 15, 1992, owner Emmett Roe pleaded guilty to 25 counts of involuntary manslaughter. No one else was found guilty. Emmett Roe had personally ordered the doors to be locked from the outside. He received a prison sentence of 19 years and 11 months. The sentence was unpopular among many of the workers and their families who {{point out that it}} amounts to less than a year for each <b>dead</b> <b>person.</b> Roe became eligible for parole in March 1994, and was released just under four years into his sentence.|$|E
25|$|The grave goods {{had to be}} {{subjected}} to the same treatment as the body, if it were to accompany the <b>dead</b> <b>person</b> to the afterlife. If a person was immolated, then the grave goods had to be burnt as well, and if the deceased was to be interred, the objects were interred together with him. The usual grave for a thrall was probably {{not much more than a}} hole in the ground. He was probably buried in such a way as to ensure both that he did not return to haunt his masters and that he could be of use to his masters after they died. Slaves were sometimes sacrificed to be useful in the next life. A free man was usually given weapons and equipment for riding. An artisan, such as a blacksmith, could receive his entire set of tools. Women were provided with their jewelry and often with tools for female and household activities. The most sumptuous Viking funeral discovered so far is the Oseberg ship burial, which was for a woman, obviously of elevated social status, who lived in the 9th century.|$|E
25|$|Following Diana's death, the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund {{was granted}} {{intellectual}} property rights over her image. In 1998, the fund sued the Franklin Mint, accusing it of illegally selling Diana dolls, plates, and jewellery after having been refused a license to do so. In California, where the initial case was tried, a suit to preserve the right of publicity may be filed {{on behalf of a}} <b>dead</b> <b>person,</b> but only if that person is a Californian. The Memorial Fund therefore filed the lawsuit on behalf of the estate and, upon losing the case, was required to pay the Franklin Mint's legal costs of £3million which, combined with other fees, caused the Memorial Fund to freeze its grants to charities. In 2003, the Franklin Mint counter-sued. In November 2004, the case was settled out of court with the Memorial Fund agreeing to pay £13.5 million (US$21.5 million) to charitable causes on which both sides agreed. In addition to this, the Memorial Fund had spent a total of close to £4 million (US$6.5 million) in costs and fees relating to this litigation, and as a result froze grants allocated to a number of charities.|$|E

500|$|The myth of Osiris {{was deeply}} {{influential}} in ancient Egyptian religion and was popular among ordinary people. One {{reason for this}} popularity is the myth's primary religious meaning, which implies that any <b>dead</b> <b>person</b> can reach a pleasant afterlife. Another {{reason is that the}} characters and their emotions are more reminiscent of the lives of real people than those in most Egyptian myths, making the story more appealing to the general populace. In particular, the myth conveys a [...] "strong sense of family loyalty and devotion", as the Egyptologist J. Gwyn Griffiths put it, in the relationships between Osiris, Isis, and Horus.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to present the {{application}} of a headspace-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-GC-MS) method for the determination of the carbon monoxide (CO) blood concentration and to compare it with carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO) saturation. In postmortem cases, the HbCO measured by spectrophotometry frequently leads to inaccurate results due to inadequate samples or analyses. The true role of CO intoxication in the death of a person could be misclassified. The estimation of HbCO from HS-GC-MS CO measurements provides helpful information by determining the total CO levels (CO linked to hemoglobin (HbCO) and CO dissociated from hemoglobin). The CO concentrations were converted in HbCO saturation levels to define cutoff blood CO values. CO limits were defined as less than 1  μmol/mL for living persons, less than 1. 5  μmol/mL for <b>dead</b> <b>persons</b> without CO exposure, and greater than 3  μmol/mL for <b>dead</b> <b>persons</b> with clear CO poisoning...|$|R
