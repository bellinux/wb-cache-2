40|$|In {{this study}} a 1 D electrochemical-thermal model is {{coupled with a}} 3 D thermal model in order to predict the heat {{generation}} and corresponding temperature distribution in a battery cell. The developed model is verified against experimental data for a 20 Ah lithium iron phosphate (LFP) which is operating at 20 °C ambient temperature. The model is then adjusted to accommodate for 10 Ah and 40 Ah cells by decreasing and increasing the surface area of each cell {{as well as the}} tab dimensions. The temperature distribution of the different cells are studied employing <b>fin</b> <b>cooling</b> as well as indirect liquid cooling system. Simulation results highlight that the temperature gradient within the surface of the 40 Ah cell is almost 1. 9 and 1. 3 times that of the 10 Ah and 20 Ah cells, respectively. Moreover, it is found that the <b>fin</b> <b>cooling</b> method by employing aluminium plates between the cells is not a good choice when applied to large format batteries. Whereas, by employing the indirect liquid cooling, a very uniform temperature along with low temperature gradient is achieved even under high discharge rate. When the two cooling units have the same volume, the obtained volumetric temperature gradient with <b>fin</b> <b>cooling</b> is equal to 20. 5, 27. 5 and 34. 7 °C for the 10 Ah, 20 Ah and 40 Ah respectively, whereas the corresponding value in case of the indirect cooling is 4. 7, 5. 2 and 6. 2 °C respectivel...|$|R

The said tubes failed when exposed to corrosive environment(s). Tubes located at the bottom row of the air <b>fin</b> <b>cooler</b> were corroded as a result of exposure to rain water, brought in by induced air when the wind blows. The tube material is A 179 Carbon steel. Two tubes, namely Tube A and Tube B along with an aluminum fin in each tube were investigated. A leak was observed on tube A, probably due to Corrosion Under Deposit mechanism. A general corrosion attack was observed at tube B, and macroscopic analysis showed that the corrosion occurred along the grain boundaries, which consist of ferrite and pearlite.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} three generically similar impingement liquid coolers {{that have}} been engineered for cooling power electronics on future aero gas turbines. The thermal and hydraulic performances of the coolers have been {{compared with that of}} a commercial, state-of-the-art pin <b>fin</b> liquid <b>cooler.</b> It is demonstrated that the impingement liquid coolers outperform thermally the baseline pin <b>fin</b> <b>cooler,</b> and with significantly lower pressure drops. The impingement liquid coolers could also be easily modified to trade reduced pressure drop against higher flowrate or reduced thermal performance. A scaling model has also been developed to predict the thermal performances of the coolers for other types of coolants and flow conditions. The model has been applied for predicting the convective thermal performances of the coolers assuming hot aircraft fuel as the coolant Future work would include an investigation of alternative convective applications in which the cooling system could be systematically explored.

40|$|Some {{thermoelectric}} modules will shift, or migrate, {{from their}} original {{position in a}} <b>cooling</b> <b>assembly</b> after the <b>cooler</b> has been in operation. This movement can cause catastrophic failure in the assembly if it is severe enough. This failure can occur in several ways: by moving the module off of the extender block (if used), or by tearing the power wires from their solder connections. This paper presents a case study to determine if power cycling is a contributor to module migration. Four similar <b>cooling</b> <b>assemblies,</b> of a type that has exhibited module migration in operation, were manufactured under controlled conditions to ensure that each assembly was built {{in exactly the same}} way or much as possible. The module position was recorded as each cooler was assembled. Coolers were operated without power cycling, and then the coolers were power cycled by sequencing positive and negative current to the modules. The position of each module was noted at each stage in the test. This data was used to indicate if cycling of applied power caused a migration of the thermoelectric modules, and if this migration was consistent from assembly to assembly. An alternative construction technique of using a conformable thermal interface was tested to determine if module migration could be mitigated...|$|R

Liquid cooling seems to be more attractive because of high specific heat capacity and chances of evaporative cooling but there can be problem of leakage, corrosion, choking, etc. which works against this method. [...] On the other hand, air cooling allows the discharged air into main flow without any problem. Quantity of air required for this purpose is 1-3% of main flow and blade temperature can be reduced by 200-300 °C.
