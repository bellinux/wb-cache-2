40|$|Abstract A (<b>general)</b> <b>preferential</b> {{entailment}} {{is defined}} by a “preference relation” among “states”. States can be either interpretations or sets of interpretations, or “copies ” of interpretations or of sets of interpretations, although {{it is known that}} the second kind and the fourth one produce the same notion. Circumscription is a special case of the simplest kind, where the states are interpretations. It is already known that a large class of preferential entailments where the states are copies of interpretations, namely the “cumulative ” ones, can be expressed as circumscriptions in a greater vocabulary. We extend this result to the most general kind of <b>general</b> <b>preferential</b> entailment, the additional property requested here is “loop”, a strong kind of “cumulativity”. The greater vocabulary needed here is large, but only a very simple and small set of formulas in this large vocabulary is necessary, which should make the method practically useful. ...|$|R

We prove the existence of an a. s. asymptotic degree distribution for a general family of coloured preferential attachment random graph models. More precisely, we show that the proportion of vertices with (generalized) degree k tends to some random variable as the number of steps goes to infinity. We also provide recurrence equations for the asymptotic degree distribution. Comment: 15 page...|$|R

40|$|Preferential {{attachment}} is a proportionate growth {{process in}} networks, where nodes receive new links {{in proportion to}} their current degree. Preferential attachment is a popular generative mechanism to explain the widespread observation of power-law-distributed networks.

We derive analytically the distribution of individual rates, which will reproduce the connectivity distribution that is obtained from a <b>general</b> <b>preferential</b> attachment process (Yule process), and the structural {{differences between the two}} types of graphs are examined by simulations.

40|$|To obtain {{monolayer}} depth {{resolution in}} the zero-energy SIMS concept, an almost atomically flat surface during the electron beam-induced etching (EBIE) is crucial. However, the surface roughness observed with Si EBIE and XeF 2 shows the same characteristics as observed during spontaneous etching of Si with XeF 2. The subsurface fluorine concentration in a Si EBIE process (even in amass transport limited regime) can influence the unactivated formation of the SiFx reaction layer as well, and therefore, contribute to observed roughness development. SiO 2 EBIE leads to extreme pit formation due to preferential etching of Si at the SiO 2 /Si interface. In <b>general,</b> <b>preferential</b> etching can deteriorate or enhance the depth resolution as shown on a SiGe epilayer structure.

50|$|In their cover business, Pfandbrief banks grant {{property}} finance, public sector, {{ship and}} aircraft loans. Pfandbriefe {{have an average}} maturity of about five to seven years. While Pfandbriefe tend {{to be associated with}} asset-backed securities they are fundamentally different. Pfandbrief cover-assets remain on the bank's balance sheet. By contrast, asset-backed securities are typically off-balance-sheet transactions. Another difference: Pfandbrief cover pools are dynamic. Their composition can and usually does change over time, depending on the maturities and on the newly registered cover assets. Due to the stringent legal provisions that govern their issuance Pfandbriefe are deemed particularly safe. An independent cover pool trustee appointed by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) records cover assets and cover asset replacements in the cover register. In the event of the Pfandbrief issuer's insolvency, Pfandbrief investors have a <b>preferential</b> <b>claim</b> on the cover assets in the cover register because cover pool assets are not included in insolvency proceedings.

This has been done by means of the PAFit method using the community's flagship journal, namely Strategic Management Journal. The results suggest the co-authorship and citation temporal networks are governed by both the fit get richer and the rich get richer processes. The average of the attachment exponents in the co-author network is 0. 3 while it is 0. 29 in the citation network, which suggests the rich get richer phenomenon is similarly weak in both networks. On the other hand, the distributions of author fitness in both networks have long right tail, which implies that the intrinsic scientific quality of each author plays a crucial role in getting new citations and new co-authorships. Furthermore, author fitness in both co-authorship and citation networks are found to be consistent with the history of the strategic management scientific community. Comment: 21 Page...|$|R
40|$|Freight {{factoring}} companies provide much-needed {{cash flow}} and additional services to trucking companies. The trucking company sells its accounts receivable, or invoices, {{at a discount}} to the freight factoring company and receives an advance of funds in exchange. The freight factoring company will then begin collecting on these invoices from the trucking company’s customers, or debtors. When a debtor sends funds to a freight factoring company, it is paying for the services rendered by the trucking company. As such, the freight factoring company is obligated to apply the funds it receives to its client’s invoices in accordance with remittance attached to the debtor’s payment. When a debtor files bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee seeks to recover as much property as possible for the bankruptcy estate. Thus, {{it is not uncommon}} for freight factoring companies to find that funds it received from a debtor may be subject to a <b>preferential</b> <b>claim</b> under Bankruptcy Code section 547 for recovery by the bankruptcy estate.

In fact econometric evidence is not totally at odds with this view. However, neither exports in a large European economy like Germany nor in a small open one, like Norway, are characterized by price taking behavior. On the contrary, both nations show strong evidence of monopolistic power in the process governing external prices, implying that supply shocks to a large extent can be passed on to prices.

40|$|Preferential {{attachment}} (PA) {{models of}} network structure {{are widely used}} due to their explanatory power and conceptual simplicity. PA models are able {{to account for the}} scale-free degree distributions observed in many real-world large networks through the remarkably simple mechanism of sequentially introducing nodes that attach preferentially to high-degree nodes. The ability to efficiently generate instances from PA models is a key asset in understanding both the models themselves and the real networks that they represent. Surprisingly, little {{attention has been paid to}} the problem of efficient instance generation. In this paper, we show that the complexity of generating network instances from a PA model depends on the preference function of the model, provide efficient data structures that work under any preference function, and present empirical results from an implementation based on these data structures. We demonstrate that, by indexing growing networks with a simple augmented heap, we can implement a network generator which scales many orders of magnitude beyond existing capabilities ($ 10 ^ 6 $ [...] $ 10 ^ 8 $ nodes). We show the utility of an efficient and general PA network generator by investigating the consequences of varying the preference functions of an existing model. We also provide "quicknet", a freely-available open-source implementation of the methods described in this work.

40|$|We study a <b>general</b> <b>preferential</b> {{attachment}} and Pólya’s urn model. At each step a new vertex is introduced, {{which can be}} connected to at most one existing vertex. If it is disconnected, it becomes a pioneer vertex. Given {{that it is not}} disconnected, it joins an existing pioneer vertex with probability proportional to a function of the degree of that vertex. This function is allowed to be vertex-dependent, and is called the reinforcement function. We prove that there can be at most three phases in this model, depending on the behavior of the reinforcement function. Consider the set whose elements are the vertices with cardinality tending a. s. to infinity. We prove that this set either is empty, or it has exactly one element, or it contains all the pioneer vertices. Moreover, we describe the phase transition in the case where the reinforcement function is the same for all vertices. Our results are general, and in particular we are not assuming monotonicity of the reinforcement function. Finally, consider the regime where exactly one vertex has a degree diverging to infinity. We give a lower bound for the probability that a given vertex ends up being the leading one, that is, its degree diverges to infinity. Our proofs rely on a generalization of the Rubin construction given for edge- reinforced random walks, and on a Brownian motion embedding...|$|R
