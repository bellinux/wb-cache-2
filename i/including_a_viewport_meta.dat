50|$|The inputs are {{a list of}} polygons and <b>a</b> <b>viewport.</b> The {{best case}} {{is that if the}} list of polygons is simple, then draw the polygons in the viewport. Simple is defined as one polygon (then the polygon or its part is drawn in {{appropriate}} part of <b>a</b> <b>viewport)</b> or <b>a</b> <b>viewport</b> that is one pixel in size (then that pixel gets a color of the polygon closest to the observer). The continuous step is to split the viewport into 4 equally sized quadrants and to recursively call the algorithm for each quadrant, with a polygon list modified such that it only contains polygons that are visible in that quadrant.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{geographic}} information {{has entered the}} mainstream, deeply altering the pre-existing patterns of its production, distribution, and consumption. Through web mapping, millions of online users utilise spatial data in interactive digital maps. The typical unit of visualisation of geo-data is <b>a</b> <b>viewport,</b> defined as <b>a</b> bi-dimensional image of a map, fixed at a given scale, in a rectangular frame. In <b>a</b> <b>viewport,</b> the user performs analytical tasks, observing individual map features, or drawing high-level judgements about the objects in the <b>viewport</b> as <b>a</b> whole. Current {{geographic information}} retrieval (GIR) systems aim at facilitating analytical tasks, and little emphasis is put on the retrieval and indexing of visualised units, i. e. viewports. In this paper we outline a holistic, viewport-based GIR system, offering an alternative approach to feature-based GIR. Such <b>a</b> system indexes <b>viewports,</b> rather than individual map features, extracting descriptors of their high-level, overall semantics in a vector space model. This approach allows for efficient comparison, classification, clustering, and indexing of <b>viewports.</b> <b>A</b> case study describes in detail how our GIR system models viewports representing geographical locations in Ireland. The results indicate advantages and limitations of the viewport-based approach, which allows for a novel exploration of geographic data, using holistic semantics...|$|R

5000|$|In {{one example}} application, {{consider}} an image editing program. A user application may render the image into <b>a</b> <b>viewport.</b> <b>As</b> the user zooms and scrolls {{to view a}} smaller portion of the image, the application can set a clip boundary so that pixels outside the viewport are not rendered. In addition, GUI widgets, overlays, and other windows or frames may obscure some pixels from the original image. In this sense, the clip region is the composite of the application-defined [...] "user clip" [...] and the [...] "device clip" [...] enforced by the system's software and hardware implementation. [...] Application software {{can take advantage of}} this clip information to save computation time, energy, and memory, avoiding work related to pixels that aren't visible.|$|R

5000|$|Other {{kinds of}} virtual desktop environments {{do not offer}} {{discrete}} virtual screens, but instead {{make it possible to}} pan around a desktop that is larger than the available hardware is capable of displaying. This facility is sometimes referred to as panning, scrolling desktops or view-port. For example, if a graphics card has a maximum resolution that is higher than the monitor's display resolution, the virtual desktop manager may allow windows to be placed [...] "off the edge" [...] of the screen.

40|$|International audienceEdge-scrolling {{allows users}} to scroll <b>a</b> <b>viewport</b> while {{simultaneously}} dragging near or beyond a windowâ€™s edge. Common implementations rely on rate control, mapping {{the distance between the}} pointer and the edge of the viewport to the scrolling velocity. While ubiquitous in operating systems, edge-scrolling has received little attention, even though previous works suggest that (1) rate control may be suboptimal for isotonic pointing devices like mice and trackpads and (2) space beyond the windowâ€™s edge might be scarce, limiting scrolling control. To address these problems, we developed Push-edge scrolling (and Slide-edge scrolling, its inertial variant), two novel position-based techniques that allow scrolling by â€˜pushingâ€™ against the <b>viewport</b> edge. <b>A</b> controlled experiment shows that our techniques reduce overshoots and offer performance improvements by up to 13 % over traditional edge-scrolling...|$|R
40|$|We have {{implemented}} an object-oriented user interface package, called InterViews, {{that supports the}} composition of a graphical user interface from a set of interactive objects. The base class for interactive objects, called an interactor, and base class for composite objects, called a scene, define a protocol for combining interactive behaviors. Subclasses of scene define common types of composition: a box tiles its components, a tray allows components to overlap or constrain each other's placement, a deck stacks its components so that only one is visible, a frame adds a border, and <b>a</b> <b>viewport</b> shows part of a component. Predefined components include menus, scrollers, buttons, and text editors. InterViews also includes classes for structured text and graphics.

40|$|Southwest Research Institute {{provided}} blast design consultation to Bernard Johnson Young Incorporated for {{the design}} of the Explosives Development Facility at Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey. The facility makes use of the foundation of an existing building with a new steel frame building with metal panel siding. Additional new construction included two explosives test chambers, each rated for 15 pounds of explosives, explosives bays, and a 5 -bay explosives magazine. This paper provides an overview of the blast safety and explosion resistant design features of the facility. Siting was verified in accordance with AMCR 385 - 100 and DoD 6055. 9. Blast resistant structural design was performed in accordance with TM 5 - 1300. The explosives bays are partially vented cubicles with roofs, and are designed to stop primary and secondary fragments and to reduce wrap-around pressures to acceptable levels at adjacent areas. The main building structure is designed to resist these wrap-around loads. The test cells are designed to respond elastically to routine explosion tests. The test cells <b>include</b> <b>a</b> blast door, <b>viewports,</b> penetrations for ventilation and electrical, and fragmentation shielding. Finally, the side wall, back wall, and roof of the magazine were designed to withstand an internal explosion while deforming plastically. The front wall and door were designed to resist an explosion in an adjacent bay.

40|$|Viewports {{into large}} visual workspaces are {{sometimes}} supplemented by a separate window that displays a miniaturized {{overview of the}} entire workspace.

Interactive rendering systems have not ordinarily been based on ray casting, due to its computational cost. Instead, the dominant method for achieving interactive rendering is hardware-assisted rasterization and depth buffering of polygons, often produced by static or dynamic tesselation of higher-level objects. Modern polygon rasterization architectures are extremely powerful, having undergone an extensive development path. Several trends indicate, however, that alternatives to polygon rasterization and depth buffering deserve examination in the design [...] ...|$|R

40|$|A {{document}} {{discusses the}} creation of <b>a</b> <b>viewport</b> suitable for use {{on the surface of}} Venus. These viewports are rated for 500 C and 100 atm pressure with appropriate safety factors and reliability required for incorporation into a Venus Lander. Sapphire windows should easily withstand the chemical, pressure, and temperatures of the Venus surface. Novel fixture designs and seals appropriate to the environment are incorporated, as are materials compatible with exploration vessels. A test cell was fabricated, tested, and leak rate measured. The window features polish specification of the sides and corners, soft metal padding of the sapphire, and a metal C-ring seal. The system safety factor is greater than 2, and standard mechanical design theory was used to size the window, flange, and attachment bolts using available material property data. Maintenance involves simple cleaning of the window aperture surfaces. The only weakness of the system is its moderate rather than low leak rate for vacuum applications...|$|R

The primary use of the Glovebox was to selectively mix protein crystals and monitor their growth. The Glovebox allowed crew members to periodically change compositions to optimize the growth, a first for space. Other tests conducted inside the Glovebox included studies on candle flames, fiber pulling, particle dispersion, surface convection in liquids, and liquid/container interfaces. Sixteen tests and demonstrations in all were conducted inside the Glovebox. The Glovebox also provided crew members the opportunity to perform backup operations on the Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus which were not planned.|$|R
