500|$|After Minh {{had ordered}} the rebels to search the areas {{known to have been}} frequented by the Ngo family, Colonel Phạm Ngọc Thảo was {{informed}} by a captured Presidential Guard officer that the brothers had escaped through the tunnels to a refuge in Cholon. Thảo was told by Khiêm, his superior, to locate Diệm and prevent him from being killed. When Thảo arrived at Ma Tuyen's house, he phoned his superiors. Diệm and Nhu overheard him and Thơ drove them to the nearby Catholic church of St. Francis Xavier, which they had frequented over the years. Lieutenant Thơ died a few months later in a plane crash, but his diary was not found until 1970. Thơ recorded Diệm's words as they left the house of Ma Tuyen as being [...] "I don't know whether I will live or die and I don't care, but tell Nguyễn Khánh that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>great</b> affection for him and he should avenge me". Soon after the early morning mass was celebrated for All Souls' Day (the Catholic day of the dead) and after the congregation had left the building, the Ngô brothers walked through the shady courtyard and into the church wearing dark grey suits. It was speculated that they were recognised by an informant as they walked through the yard. Inside the church, the brothers prayed and received Communion.|$|E

500|$|Blount was undrafted in the 2010 NFL Draft but {{agreed in}} {{principle}} to a free agent contract with the San Francisco 49ers following the draft. However, after a meeting with Tennessee Titans head coach Jeff Fisher, Blount decided to sign as an undrafted free agent with the Titans instead. [...] In August 2010, Blount was involved in another incident in which he threw a punch, this time at teammate defensive end Eric Bakhtiari, a few moments after having his own helmet ripped off in practice. [...] Blount quickly talked to Titans head coach Jeff Fisher before leaving the field. [...] "He apologized, and I said he didn't have to apologize," [...] Fisher said. [...] "It's football. It's training camp[...] [...] [...] His past is his past. Is that the first punch you've seen in camp this year? No. I'm not disappointed whatsoever. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>great</b> confidence in the young man that he learned from his mistake, and he's very competitive. That's why we brought him in here is to watch him run the football like that." [...] Blount survived the final roster cut and {{was placed on the}} Titans' 53-man roster. Blount was then waived by the team on September 5, 2010, to make room for veteran linebackers Tim Shaw (Chicago Bears) and Patrick Bailey (Pittsburgh Steelers). Titans sources indicated that Blount would be signed to the rookie practice squad if Blount cleared waivers, which he did not.|$|E
500|$|After the season, {{head coach}} Lloyd Carr was {{replaced}} by Rich Rodriguez. [...] Rodriguez' no huddle spread option offense, which used zone blocking, was a major adjustment for Boren. By the tenth day of spring practice Boren had left the team. Boren made {{a statement to the}} press regarding his decision, which included the following excerpt: [...] "Michigan football was a family, built on mutual respect and support for each other from (former) Coach (Lloyd) Carr on down. We knew it took the entire family, a team effort, and we all worked together[...] <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>great</b> trouble accepting that those family values have eroded in just a few months[...] [...]That I am unable to perform under these circumstances at the level I expect of myself, and my teammates and Michigan fans deserve, is why I have made the decision to leave." [...] A month later, Ohio State coach Jim Tressel announced Boren would redshirt for the 2008 NCAA Division I FBS football season and become the first player to transfer from Michigan to play for archrival Ohio State since at least World War II. [...] According to Section 14.5.2.B of the Rules of Eligibility in the Big Ten handbook, Boren is ineligible to be a scholarship athlete after transferring. [...] A little more than a week after Justin announced his transfer, his younger brother Zach committed to Ohio State. [...] Later that summer, Detroit Free Press writer Michael Rosenberg, backed up Boren's statement about family values: [...] "Rodriguez's staff uses some of the foulest, most degrading language imaginable. I know coaches curse, and I'm no prude, but this goes way beyond a few dirty words. He belittles his players. This {{is a big part of}} why offensive lineman Justin Boren [...] left the team.

2500|$|Brighton Pavilion had {{the highest}} vote in the 2005 general {{election}} for a Green Party candidate when Keith Taylor, a former Green Party Principal Speaker, gained 22% of the vote.

In a letter to party members, she indicated that she would only stand if she won the internal party selection election by more than 10%, to avoid internal division.

2500|$|The philosopher, if {{he loves}} true wisdom {{and not the}} passions and appetites of the body, accepts that he can come closest to true {{knowledge}} and wisdom in death, as {{he is no longer}} confused by the body and the senses.

[...] Death, however, is a rite of purification from the [...] "infection" [...] of the body. As the philosopher practices death his entire life, he should greet it amicably and not be discouraged upon its arrival, for, since the universe the Gods created for us in life is essentially [...] "good," [...] why would death be anything but a continuation of this goodness?
