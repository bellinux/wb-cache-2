The typical connection of such kind is part's connection of production machines frames. Proposed method describes a connection as a system of springs in normal, tangential and torsional direction generally loaded by forces and moments in direction of x, y and z coordinates. The knowledge of stiffness value for each connecting element is a necessary condition for solution of the spring system.

40|$|Abstract. Cryptographic {{devices such}} as Hardware Security Modules are only as secure as their {{application}} programming interfaces (APIs) that offer cryp-tographic functionality to the outside world. Design flaws and implementation errors in security APIs {{have been shown to}} cause vulnerabilities that may leak secrets such as <b>keys</b> <b>and</b> <b>PINs.</b> Ideally, we would like to design such interfaces {{in such a way that}} we can formally prove security properties, even in the presence of some corrupted keys. In this work, we propose the first such provably secure interface to support asymmetric key operations for key management: Cachin and Chandran’s secure token interface supports asymmetric key operations only for encrypting and signing data, but not for managing keys, while Cortier and Steel handle only symmetric keys. Due to the fact that anyone can encrypt under a public key, in order to secure integrity of the keys under management, we must consider confidentiality and integrity properties separately and provide support for classical operations of public key infrastructure (e. g. certification of public keys). ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Numerous passwords, swipe cards, <b>keys</b> <b>and</b> <b>PIN</b> {{numbers are}} used daily {{to gain access}} to various services. However, these {{mechanisms}} can become cumbersome to carry around and remember. It would be much more convenient to speak some arbitrary text thereby allowing an identification system to determine our identity. This method of authentication is user-friendly as we don’t usually forget how to speak or leave our speech at home! However, when identifying speakers over the telephone, identification performance degrades due to the effect of telephone channels on speech signals. As a result, this paper addresses the problem of text-independent speaker identification on telephone-quality speech. In particular, we investigate how various channel normalization techniques can be used to improve speaker identification performance. We show that by using a technique known as histogram equalization, significant improvements above those reported in literature, are achieved...|$|R

50|$|In {{a master}} keyed lock, {{some or all}} of the shaft hole in the lock have three pins in them instead of two. Between the driver <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> the <b>key</b> <b>pin</b> is a third pin called the spacer pin. Thus each pin line has two shear points, one where the driver <b>and</b> spacer <b>pins</b> meet, <b>and</b> one where the spacer <b>and</b> <b>key</b> <b>pins</b> meet. So the lock will open with two keys; one aligns the first set of shear points and the other aligns the second set of shear points. The locks are {{manufactured}} so one set of shear points is unique to each lock, while the second set is identical in all the locks. A more secure type of mechanism has two separate tumblers, each opened by one key.|$|R
50|$|A {{pin tumbler}} lock is {{composed}} {{of a series of}} spring-loaded stacks called pin stacks. Each pin stack {{is composed of}} two pins that are stacked on top of each other: the key pin, which touches the key when it is inserted, <b>and</b> the driver <b>pin,</b> which is spring driven. When the different length key pins are aligned at their tops by the insertion of the correspondingly cut key at their bases, the tops of the <b>key</b> <b>pins</b> <b>and,</b> consequently, the bases of the driver pins, form a shear line, so that the cylinder can be turned, rotating the key pins away from the driver pins. When no key or the wrong key is in the lock, pin misalignment prevents the cylinder from turning.|$|R

5000|$|When bumping a lock, {{the key is}} {{initially}} inserted into the key way one notch (pin) short of full insertion. Bumping the key inward forces it deeper into the key way. The specially designed teeth of the bump key transmit a slight impact force {{to all of the}} bottom pins in the lock. The key pins transmit this force to the driver pins; the key pins stay in place. This physics action can be visualized by observing the same effect on the desktop toy: Newton's cradle. Because the pin movements are highly elastic, the driver pins [...] "jump" [...] from the key pins for a fraction of a second, moving higher than the cylinder (shear line of the tumbler), then are pushed normally back by the spring to sit against the key pins once again. Even though this separation only lasts a split second, if a light rotational force is continuously applied to the key during the slight impact, the cylinder will turn during the short separation time of the <b>key</b> <b>and</b> driver <b>pins,</b> <b>and</b> the lock can be opened while the driver pins are elevated above the key way. Lock bumping takes only an instant to open the lock. The lock is not visibly damaged, although the force of the bump can leave an indentation {{on the front of the}} cylinder. Certain clicking and vibrating tools designed for bumping can also be used. These allow for rapid repetition of bumping against locks that have advertised [...] "bump proof" [...] features. Only a rare few key-pin locks cannot be bumped.|$|R

5000|$|The tall, {{vertically}} strung upright grand {{was arranged}} like a grand set on end, with the soundboard and bridges above the <b>keys,</b> <b>and</b> tuning <b>pins</b> below them. The term was later revived by many manufacturers for advertising purposes. [...] "Giraffe pianos", [...] "pyramid pianos" [...] and [...] "lyre pianos" [...] were {{arranged in a}} somewhat similar fashion, using evocatively shaped cases. The very tall cabinet piano was introduced about 1805 and was built through the 1840s. It had strings arranged vertically on a continuous frame with bridges extended nearly to the floor, behind the keyboard and very large sticker action. The short cottage upright or pianino with vertical stringing, made popular by Robert Wornum around 1815, was built into the 20th century. They are informally called birdcage pianos because of their prominent damper mechanism. The oblique upright, popularized in France by Roller & Blanchet during the late 1820s, was diagonally strung throughout its compass. The tiny spinet upright was manufactured from the mid-1930s until recent times. The low position of the hammers required {{the use of a}} [...] "drop action" [...] to preserve a reasonable keyboard height. Modern upright and grand pianos attained their present, 2000-era forms {{by the end of the}} 19th century. While improvements have been made in manufacturing processes, and many individual details of the instrument continue to receive attention, and a small number of acoustic pianos are produced with MIDI recording and sound module-triggering capabilities, the 19th century was the era of the most dramatic innovations and modifications of the instrument.|$|R

25|$|This {{style of}} connector, {{produced}} by Italian manufacturer BTicino, {{appeared in the}} 1960s and was intended {{as an alternative to}} the Europlug or CEI 23-16 connectors then in use. The socket is an almost rectangular socket, with one or more lateral <b>key</b> <b>pins</b> <b>and</b> indentations to prevent inverting the polarised plug, or connecting plugs and sockets with different current ratings. At least four models were produced: three single-phase general purpose connectors rated respectively 10 A, 16 A and 20 A; plus a three-phase industrial connector rated 10 A; all of them have different key-pin positioning so plugs and sockets cannot be mismatched. The socket is closed by a safety lid (bearing the word ‘’Magic’’ on it) which can be opened only with an even pressure on its surface, thus preventing the insertion of objects (except the plug itself) inside the socket. The contacts are blades positioned on both sides of the plug; the plug is energized only when it is inserted fully into the socket.|$|R
