The two main gear legs were each offset significantly outboard in their nacelles, and retracted towards the tail; oleo scissors faced forwards. Each main wheel was inboard of its gear leg and oleo. Main gear doors were two pieces, split evenly, longitudinally, hinged at inner door's inboard edge and the outer door's outboard edge.|$|E
50|$|The {{cross-section}} of the nacelles was essentially circular throughout, growing then diminishing in size when {{moving from the}} engine cowlings past the wing and gear bay, towards the tail booms and the vertical stabilizers. A bulge {{on the top of}} the wing maintained the circular cross-section as the nacelles intersected the wing. The cross-section became slightly egg-shaped around the main <b>gear</b> <b>bays,</b> larger at the bottom but still round. An oblong bulge on the bottom of the main gear doors, oriented longitudinally, accommodated the main wheels when the gear was retracted.|$|E
50|$|Existing {{photographs}} of the engine bay of the final pre-production version of this system clearly show the liquid coolant from both separators was piped along the bottom {{left side of the}} engine compartment and into the right wing. The header tanks were located in the outer wing panels ahead of the main spar and immediately outboard of the main landing <b>gear</b> <b>bays.</b> The tanks extended over the same portion of the outer panel's span as the outer flaps. Coolant from the right wing header tank was pumped by a separate, electrical pump to the left wing header tank. Along the way from the right to left wing, the coolant passed through a conventional radiator mounted {{on the bottom of the}} fuselage. That radiator was retractable and intended for use only during ground-running or low-speed flight. Nevertheless, coolant passed through it whenever the engine was running and regardless of whether it was extended or retracted. In the retracted position, the radiator offered little cooling, but some heat was exchanged into the aft fuselage. Finally, a return tube connected the left wing's header tank to that on the right. This allowed the coolant to equalize between the two header tanks and circulate through the retractable radiator. The engine drew coolant directly from both header tanks through two separate pipes that ran through the main landing <b>gear</b> <b>bays,</b> up the firewall at the back of the engine compartment, and into the usual coolant intakes located at the top rear of the engine.|$|E

50|$|The aircraft's brakes {{overheated}} due to {{the application}} of full engine power during taxiing. This caused the magnesium wheels to burst, one {{of them on the}} runway prior to departure. Upon retraction of the landing gear, the hydraulic lines in the <b>gear</b> <b>bay</b> were damaged. This was caused either by the wheels that had exploded, or the bursting of the other wheel rims during the climb. Subsequently, spilled hydraulic fluid ignited when it came in contact with the overheated landing gear rims. The fire damaged the <b>gear</b> <b>bay,</b> followed by the wing. Finally losing its hydraulic pressure, the aircraft became impossible to control. The cabin and the cockpit were filled with smoke, adding to the predicament of the crew. Control of the aircraft was lost totally at around 06:18, and the ensuing final dive and impact destroyed the aircraft.|$|R

50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{consisted of}} a stringer-skin structure supported by large numbers of light section frames; these frames were attached to Z-section stringers which were in turn rivetted to the skin. A semi-circular spine-like reinforcing beam was to traverse {{the full length of}} the fuselage for strength and to stiffen the structure. The entirety of the fuselage was to be pressurised, including its two underfloor cargo holds; the only exceptions being far end of the tail and the landing <b>gear</b> <b>bays.</b> A total of eighteen semi-circular windows, similar to those used on the earlier Vickers Viscount, were to be set into the fuselage along with front and rear entrance doors and a total of six emergency exits. The floor of the main cabin was to be constructed so that it could withstand up to 75lb/sq ft in the center sections while the outer sections were to support up to 150lb/sq ft.|$|E
40|$|The Electromagnetics and Sensors Branch of NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is {{investigating}} the potential of an all-wireless aircraft {{as part of the}} ECON (Efficient Reconfigurable Cockpit Design and Fleet Operations using Software Intensive, Networked and Wireless Enabled Architecture) seedling proposal, which is funded by the Convergent Aeronautics Solutions (CAS) project, Transformative Aeronautics Concepts (TAC) program, and NASA Aeronautics Research Institute (NARI). The project consists of a brief effort carried out by a small team in the Electromagnetic Environment Effects (E 3) laboratory with the intention of exposing some of the challenges faced by a wireless communication system inside the reflective cavity of an aircraft and to explore potential solutions that take advantage of that environment for constructive gain. The research effort was named EWAIC for "Enabling Wireless Aircraft Intra-communications. " The E 3 laboratory is a research facility that includes three electromagnetic reverberation chambers and equipment that allow testing and generation of test data for the investigation of wireless systems in reflective environments. Using these chambers, the EWAIC team developed a set of tests and setups that allow the intentional variation of intensity of a multipath field to reproduce the environment of the various bays and cabins of large transport aircraft. This setup, in essence, simulates an aircraft environment that allows the investigation and testing of wireless communication protocols that can effectively be used as a tool to mitigate some of the risks inherent to an aircraft wireless system for critical functions. In addition, the EWAIC team initiated the development of a computational modeling tool to illustrate the propagation of EM waves inside the reflective cabins and bays of aircraft and to obtain quantifiable information regarding the degradation of signals in aircraft subassemblies. The nose landing gear of a UAV CAD model was used to model the propagation of a system in a "deployed" configuration versus a "stowed" configuration. The differences in relative field strength provide valuable information about the distribution of the field {{that can be used to}} engineer RF links with optimal radiated power and antenna configuration that accomplish the intended system reliability. Such modeling will be necessary in subsequent studies for managing multipath propagation characteristics inside a main cabin and to understand more complex environments, such as the inside wings, landing <b>gear</b> <b>bays,</b> cargo bays, avionics bays, etc. The results of the short research effort are described in the present document. The team puts forth a set of recommendations with the intention of informing the project and program leadership of the future work that, in the opinion of the EWAIC team, would assist the ECON team reach the intended goal of developing an all-wireless aircraft...|$|E

50|$|Air traffic {{controller}} Gilles Logelin noticed the flames before the Concorde was airborne, and informed the flight crew. Having passed V1 speed, the crew continued the takeoff, but the plane did not gain enough airspeed {{with the three}} remaining engines, because damage to the landing <b>gear</b> <b>bay</b> door prevented the retraction of the undercarriage. The aircraft was unable to climb or accelerate, and its speed decayed {{during the course of}} its brief flight. The fire caused damage to the port wing, which began to disintegrate—melted by the extremely high temperatures. Engine number one surged again, but this time failed to recover. Due to the asymmetric thrust, the starboard wing lifted, banking the aircraft to over 100 degrees. The crew reduced the power on engines three and four in an attempt to level the aircraft, but with falling airspeed, they lost control and the aircraft stalled, crashing into the Hôtelissimo Les Relais Bleus Hotel near the airport.|$|R
5000|$|During the Concorde's takeoff run, it {{ran over}} {{this piece of}} debris, cutting a tyre and sending {{a large chunk of}} tyre debris (4.5 kg) into the {{underside}} of the aircraft's wing at an estimated speed of 140 m/s. Although it did not directly puncture any of the fuel tanks, it sent out a pressure shockwave that ruptured the number-five fuel tank at the weakest point, just above the undercarriage. Leaking fuel gushing out {{from the bottom of the}} wing was most likely ignited by an electric arc in the landing <b>gear</b> <b>bay</b> (debris cutting the landing gear wire) or through contact with hot parts of the engine. Engines one and two both surged and lost all power, but engine one slowly recovered over the next few seconds. A large plume of flame developed; the flight engineer then shut down engine two in response to a fire warning and the captain's command.|$|R
5000|$|The 727 was {{designed}} for smaller airports, so independence from ground facilities was an important requirement. This led {{to one of the}} 727's most distinctive features: the built-in airstair that opens from the rear underbelly of the fuselage, which initially could be opened in flight. Hijacker D. B. Cooper parachuted from the back of a 727 as it was flying over the Pacific Northwest. Boeing subsequently modified the design with the Cooper vane so that the airstair could not be lowered in flight. [...] Another innovation was the auxiliary power unit (APU), which allowed electrical and air-conditioning systems to run independently of a ground-based power supply, and without having to start one of the main engines. An unusual design feature is that the APU is mounted in a hole in the keel beam web, in the main landing <b>gear</b> <b>bay.</b> The 727 is equipped with a retractable tail skid that is designed to protect the aircraft {{in the event of an}} over-rotation on takeoff. The 727's fuselage has an outer diameter of 148 in. This allows six-abreast seating (three per side) and a single aisle when 18 in wide coach-class seats are installed. An unusual feature of the fuselage is the 10 in difference between the lower lobe forward and aft of the wing as the higher fuselage height of the center section was simply retained towards the rear.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} years a {{multidisciplinary}} aircraft design process chain has been developed at the DLR (German Aerospace Center) to evaluate and optimize transport aircraft {{under a variety of}} different aspects such as aerodynamics, structural behaviour, flight control, etc. Aside from the different disciplines the process chain also combines analysis tools on different fidelity levels up to sophisticated CFD and CSM methods based on Finite Element analyses. For the transfer of aircraft parameters between the disciplinary tools a common data format called CPACS (Common Parameterized Aircraft Configuration Schema) has been established. One of the established tools in the aforementioned tool chain is TRAFUMO (Transport Aircraft Fuselage Model), developed at the Institute of Structures and Design, for the automatic generation and subsequent sizing of global finite element fuselage models using ANSYS with its scripting language APDL and the Python programming language. In order to increase the flexibility of this tool with respect to the integration of alternative solvers and to improve the performance, all functionality of the TRAFUMO tool has been shifted to Python based tools making use of advanced libraries such as numpy, pandas, mayavi, etc. The new Python modules provide algorithms for the automatic creation of global finite element models based on geometric and structural data from CPACS and the subsequent conversion to input decks for different solvers. The global FE model covers the skin of the aircraft fuselage that is reinforced by discretely modelled stringers and frames to represent longitudinal and circumferential reinforcements, the passenger and cargo floor structure as well as bulkheads to limit the pressurized part of the fuselage. In addition, complex interface regions for the realistic introduction of loads from wing and empennage models, as well as the main landing <b>gear</b> <b>bay</b> are modelled. Taking advantage of the modular and object-oriented nature of Python, each of the new modules has been implemented independently with a well-defined central data format in place for storing and exchanging information, which provides more flexibility at significantly improved runtimes. Following a brief overview of the DLR process chain and the CPACS data structure {{a detailed description of the}} new, purely Python based modelling and conversion tools will be given. With exemplary fuselage models covering different aircraft sizes from short to long range transport aircraft the modules for geometry processing, FE model generation, application of appropriate loads and boundary conditions and finally conversion to a selected solver format will be presented.
