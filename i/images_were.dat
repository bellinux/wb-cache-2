5|$|Once the 342 {{individual}} <b>images</b> <b>were</b> cleaned of cosmic-ray {{hits and}} corrected for scattered light, {{they had to}} be combined. Scientists involved in the HDF observations pioneered a technique called 'drizzling', in which the pointing of the telescope was varied minutely between sets of exposures. Each pixel on the WFPC2 CCD chips recorded an area of sky 0.09 arcseconds across, but by changing the direction in which the telescope was pointing by less than that between exposures, the resulting <b>images</b> <b>were</b> combined using sophisticated image-processing techniques to yield a final angular resolution better than this value. The HDF images produced at each wavelength had final pixel sizes of 0.03985 arcseconds.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — It {{is often}} {{required}} in image processing to embed multiple images {{in a single}} image. These <b>images</b> may <b>be</b> invisible in host image depending upon bit position. In this paper bit planes of an <b>image</b> <b>are</b> extracted using Bit Plane slicing Technique (BPS) and two <b>images</b> <b>are</b> embedded into a single image. The individual bit planes of cameraman <b>image</b> <b>are</b> also shown and later on properties of bit planes of an <b>image</b> <b>are</b> also discussed...|$|R
5|$|The data {{processing}} yielded four monochrome images (at 300nm, 450nm, 606nm and 814nm), one at each wavelength. One image was designated as red (814nm), the second as green (606nm) {{and the third}} as blue (450nm), and the three <b>images</b> <b>were</b> combined to give a colour image. Because the wavelengths at which the <b>images</b> <b>were</b> taken do not correspond to the wavelengths of red, green and blue light, the colours in the final image only give an approximate representation of the actual colours of the galaxies in the image; the choice of filters for the HDF (and the majority of Hubble images) was primarily designed to maximize the scientific utility of the observations rather than to create colours corresponding to what the human eye would actually perceive.|$|E

Observers were also instructed that when they could not determine which <b>image</b> <b>was</b> of higher quality within 15  s, it should be considered that the two stereoscopic <b>images</b> <b>are</b> comparable, and that neither left better nor right better should be selected.|$|R

5|$|Historically, optical astronomy, {{also called}} visible light astronomy, {{is the oldest}} form of astronomy. Images of {{observations}} were originally drawn by hand.

Modern images are made using digital detectors, particularly using charge-coupled devices (CCDs) and recorded on modern medium. Although visible light itself extends from approximately 4000 Å to 7000 Å (400 nm to 700nm), that same equipment can be used to observe some near-ultraviolet and near-infrared radiation.|$|E

In April 1870 a Monsieur Delacroix presented photographs of an intersex individual at the Société Médicale de Reims. In 1930 German physician Magnus Hirschfeld published a portrait of himself with an intersex individual in his five-volume Geschlechtskunde (Sexology), while Louis Ombrédanne published 25 images of cases he had handled in his 1939 book Les hermaphrodites et la chirurgie (Hermaphrodites and Surgery).|$|E

40|$|Color <b>image</b> {{segmentation}} <b>is</b> {{useful for}} fast retrieval in large image database. For that purpose, new image segmentation technique {{based on the}} probability of pixel distribution in the <b>image</b> <b>is</b> proposed. Color <b>image</b> <b>is</b> first divided into R, G, and B channel images. Then, pixel distribution from each of channel <b>image</b> <b>is</b> extracted to select {{to which it is}} similar among the well known probabilistic distribution function- Weibull, Exponential, Beta, Gamma, Normal, and Uniform. We use sum of least square error to measure of the quality how well an <b>image</b> <b>is</b> fitted to distribution. That P. d. f has minimum score in relation to sum of square error is chosen. Next, each <b>image</b> <b>is</b> quantized into 4 gray levels by applying thresholds to the c. d. f of the selected distribution of each channel. Finally, three quantized <b>images</b> <b>are</b> combined into one color image to obtain final segmentation result.

The spacecraft also studied Saturn's rings, revealing the thin F-ring and the fact that dark gaps in the rings are bright when viewed at high phase angle (towards the Sun), meaning that they contain fine light-scattering material. In addition, Pioneer 11 measured the temperature of Titan.|$|E
