His female glamour and elegance Cocteau likens to a cloud of dust thrown into the eyes of the audience, blinding it to the masculinity of the movements he needs to perform his acrobatics. That blindness is so complete {{that at the end of}} his act, Barbette does not simply remove his wig but instead plays the part of a man. He rolls his shoulders, stretches his hands, swells his muscles...And after the fifteenth or so curtain call, he gives a mischievous wink, shifts <b>from</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>foot,</b> mimes a bit of an apology, and does a shuffling little street urchin dance – all of it to erase the fabulous, dying-swan impression left by the act." [...] Cocteau calls upon his fellow artists to incorporate deliberately this effect that he believes for Barbette is instinctive.|$|E
2500|$|Viewers {{are told}} that in the beginning, god (lower case [...] "g" [...] as {{explicitly}} stated in the narration) created death and {{not knowing what to}} do with it, kept it in a sealed urn. Toad was asked by god to watch the urn but Frog pestered Toad into giving it to him. Frog proceeded to juggle the jar <b>from</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>foot</b> and accidentally dropped it, [...] thus letting 'death' out, whereby everything from that point on had to die. As a symbolic reference to this story, George is frequently shown caring for an albino Argentine Horned Frog (also known as a Pacman frog) identical to the one shown during the opening narration.|$|E

During the 2005-06 offseason, Padres CEO Sandy Alderson adjusted the dimensions in right-center field in an attempt to make it more hitter friendly. At the end of the 2008 season, Petco Park ranked 29th in hits and 30th out of 30 in home runs per Major League ballpark. Following the conclusion of the 2012 season, the Padres announced that they were moving the fences in to make this ballpark more favorable to hitters than it had been previously. The left-center field wall was moved in <b>from</b> 402 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> 390 <b>feet,</b> the right-center field wall was moved <b>from</b> 411 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> 391 <b>feet,</b> and the right field wall was moved in <b>from</b> 360 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> 349 <b>feet.</b> In addition, the visiting team bullpen was moved from foul territory in right field to behind the left-center field wall, right behind where the Padres bullpen is. The right field wall was also lowered <b>from</b> 11 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> 8 <b>feet,</b> and the out-of-town scoreboard was relocated.|$|R

He was very curious, was the cave bear, more curious than any of the bears that live now, and the flickering fire and the incomprehensible movements of the man, let alone the intrusion into his indisputable province, stirred him with a sense of strange new happenings. He had been after red deer fawn that night, for the cave bear was a miscellaneous hunter, but this quite turned him from that enterprise.|$|E

[...] And as he listened Thimble shuffled <b>from</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>foot,</b> his heart uneasy, to hear her cry so hollowly the beauty of that Rose.

6000|$|Or has the Reader {{forgotten}} that 'flood of savages,' which, {{in sight of}} the same Friend of Men, descended from the mountains at Mont d'Or? Lank-haired haggard faces; shapes rawboned, in high sabots; in woollen jupes, with leather girdles studded with copper-nails! They rocked <b>from</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>foot,</b> and beat time with their elbows too, as the quarrel and battle which was not long in beginning went on; shouting fiercely; the lank faces distorted into the similitude of a cruel laugh. For they were darkened and hardened: long had they been the prey of excise-men and tax-men; of 'clerks with the cold spurt of their pen.' It was the fixed prophecy of our old Marquis, which no man would listen to, that 'such Government by Blind-man's-buff, stumbling along too far, would end by the General Overturn, the Culbute Generale!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because he has confessed everything," [...] {{answered}} Sotillo, {{with the}} hardihood of desperation. He felt himself cornered. He brazened {{it out on}} the strength of his reputation with very fair success. His hearers thought him very capable of such an act. They were disposed to believe his flattering tale. There is no credulity so eager and blind as the credulity of covetousness, which, in its universal extent, measures the moral misery and the intellectual destitution of mankind. Ah! he had confessed everything, this fractious Jew, this bribon. Good! Then he was no longer wanted. A sudden dense guffaw was heard from the senior captain--a big-headed man, with little round eyes and monstrously fat cheeks which never moved. The old major, tall and fantastically ragged like a scarecrow, walked round the body of the late Senor Hirsch, muttering to himself with ineffable complacency that like this {{there was no need to}} guard against any future treacheries of that scoundrel. The others stared, shifting <b>from</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>foot,</b> and whispering short remarks to each other.|$|E

6000|$|... "What {{need of the}} Four, then?" [...] said Bagheera, {{shifting}} <b>from</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>foot,</b> {{his eyes}} ablaze, and purring louder than ever. [...] "I can hold them, Little Brother. Is it killing at last? The singing {{and the sight of}} the men climbing up the trees have made me very ready. Who is Man that we should care for him--the naked brown digger, the hairless and toothless, the eater of earth? I have followed him all day--at noon--in the white sunlight. I herded him as the wolves herd buck. I am Bagheera! Bagheera! Bagheera! As I dance with my shadow, so danced I with those men. Look!" [...] The great panther leaped as a kitten leaps at a dead leaf whirling overhead, struck left and right into the empty air, that sang under the strokes, landed noiselessly, and leaped again and again, while the half purr, half growl gathered head as steam rumbles in a boiler. [...] "I am Bagheera--in the jungle--in the night, and my strength is in me. Who shall stay my stroke? Man-cub, with one blow of my paw I could beat thy head flat as a dead frog in the summer!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{object of}} this design hovered there again, {{considerably}} restless, shifting <b>from</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>foot,</b> changing his place, beginning and giving up motions, striking matches {{for a fresh}} cigarette, offering them again, redundantly, to his guest and then not lighting himself--but all the while with the smile of another creature than the creature known to Mark; all the while {{with the history of}} something that had happened to him ever so handsomely shining out. Mark was conscious within himself from this time on of two quite distinct processes of notation--that of his practically instant surrender to the consequences of the act of perception in his host of which the two women trained suppos-ably in the art of pleasing had been altogether incapable; and that of some other condition on Newton's part that left his own poor power of divination nothing less than shamed. This last was signally the case on the former's saying, ever so responsively, almost radiantly, in answer to his account of how he happened to come: [...] "Oh then it's very interesting!" [...] That was the astonishing note, after what he had been through: neither Mrs. Folliott nor Florence Ash had so much as hinted or breathed to him that he might have incurred that praise. No wonder therefore he was now taken--with this fresh party's instant suspicion and imputation of it; though it was indeed for some minutes next as if each tried to see which could accuse the other of the greater miracle of penetration. Mark was so struck, in a word, with the extraordinarily straight guess Winch had had there in reserve for him that, other quick impressions helping, there was nothing for him but to bring out, himself: [...] "There must be, my dear man, something rather wonderful the matter with you!" [...] The quite more intensely and more irresistibly drawn grin, the quite unmistakably deeper consciousness in the dark, wide eye, that accompanied the not quite immediate answer to which remark he was afterward to remember. [...] "How do you know that--or why do you think it?" [...] "Because there must be--for you to see! I shouldn't have expected it." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{weeks and}} months went by, {{and it was always}} the Germans, the Germans; Fred had clearly not yet shot them up; and now one and now another went off from the village, and two from the farm itself; and the great Fred {{returned}} slightly injured for a few weeks' rest, and, full of whisky from morning till night, made the village ring; and finally went off again in a mood of manifest reluctance. All this weighed dumbly on the mind of the little cowman, the more heavily that because of his inarticulate shyness he could never talk that weight away, nor could anyone by talk relieve him, no premises of knowledge or vision being there. From sheer physical contagion he felt the grizzly menace in the air, and a sense of being left behind when others were going to meet that menace with their fists, as it were. There was something proud and sturdy in the little man, even in the look of him, for all that he was 'poor old Tom,' who brought a smile to the lips of all. He was passionate, too, if rubbed up the wrong way; but it needed the malevolence and ingenuity of human beings to annoy him--with his beasts he never lost his temper, so that they had perfect confidence in him. He resembled indeed herdsmen of the Alps, whom one may see in dumb communion with their creatures up in those high solitudes; for he too dwelt in a high solitude cut off from real fellowship with men and women by lack of knowledge, and by the supercilious pity in them. Living in such a remote world his talk--when he did say something--had ever the surprising quality attaching to the thoughts of those by whom the normal proportions of things are quite unknown. His short square figure, hatless and rarely coated in any weather, dotting <b>from</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>foot,</b> a bit of stick in one hand, and often a straw in the mouth--he did not smoke--was familiar in the yard where he turned the handle of the separator, or in the fields and cowsheds, from daybreak to dusk, save for the hours of dinner and tea, which he ate in the farm kitchen, making sparse and surprising comments. To his peculiar whistles and calls the cattle and calves, for all their rumination and stubborn shyness, were amazingly responsive. It was a pretty sight to see them pushing against each other round him--for, after all, he was as much the source of their persistence, especially through the scanty winter months, as a mother starling to her unfledged young.|$|E
