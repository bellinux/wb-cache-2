No. Mr. Speaker, why <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>not</b> reveal this? Why <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>not</b> act when the House was sitting in January, February, March, and April? They had the information... You concealed the facts, {{that is what you}} did.|$|E
25|$|As soon as {{the captain}} of Courier des Seychelles saw Duncan and Emilie, he hid on shore the 200 slaves {{that he had been}} carrying. He also hid his all his cables and anchors. Sneyd sent search parties that succeeded in despoiling the homes of owners of Courier des Seychellles, and {{bringing}} back her sails, cables and anchors. However, not only <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>not</b> find the 200 slaves, but four British sailors deserted, with their weapons, and also could not be found.|$|E
500|$|Raoul Berger, in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review, disagrees; {{the words}} of the statute were clear, and the only {{application}} that it could have was unjust. Statutory interpretation allows for the ignoring of unjust extraneous meanings, but what Coke did was nullify the statute as a whole, along with its main intention. John V. Orth, writing in the Constitutional Commentary, concurs: [...] "If that were so, why <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>not</b> say so? Is it likely that the royal judges, confronting a case involving a statute that had necessarily passed both houses of parliament and received the royal assent, would lightly use the word 'void'?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Aharon Lichtenstein, of the Gush Etzion yeshiva, {{spoke of}} the fact that people hoped that Schneerson could be the Mashiach during at his yeshiva when the Rebbe died by saying how [...] "it never {{occurred}} to anyone to declare that Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, Rabbi Aharon Kotler, or the Rav was the Messiah.

2500|$|In the maftir (...) {{reading that}} concludes the parashah, Judah and his {{brothers}} came to Joseph's house and fell before him on the ground. Joseph asked them what they had done, <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>not</b> know that a man such as he would divine? Judah asked how they could clear themselves when God had found out their iniquity; they were all Joseph's bondmen. But Joseph insisted that only the man in whose hand the goblet was found would be his bondman, and the others could go in peace to their father. The seventh reading ( [...] , aliyah), the single closed portion ( [...] , setumah), and the parashah end here.|$|E
2500|$|Not only <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>not</b> {{secure a}} title for Sophie, but the couple’s {{position}} in English society was threatened {{when in the}} same year Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia, Nicholas II's younger brother, chose England for his exile after also contracting a morganatic marriage. The arrival in England of another and more senior grand duke, Michael Alexandrovich, provided an uncomfortable reminder of the scandal which had once attached to Michael Mikahilovich and his wife. [...] As a result, they never received the newcomers at Kenwood. Their refusal to open their doors to the couple meant that many others in English society followed suit, with the result that Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich and his wife were effectively marginalized.|$|E

2500|$|The {{relationship}} between Company and Corporation {{appears to have}} been an uneasy one. There were complaints from local residents about the running of trams on Sundays. [...] There was a proposal from the company to the council asking to share the cost of narrowing causeways (pavements) on Arkwright St. [...] This was {{due to the fact that}} Arkwright St was not sufficiently wide such that vehicles could park on the roadway without obstructing the tramlines. Clearly the council were unhappy, as not only <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>not</b> agree to share the cost, they insisted that the company leave the pavements as they were. [...] There was also a disagreement with the company over the maintenance of the roads in which the tramways ran. The work was supposed to be done by the Corporation, with the bills being paid by the company, but the company found it was cheaper to hire in labour directly. The Corporation threatened proceedings and insisted on the withdrawal of the company's labour.|$|E
2500|$|The school newspaper, The Towerlight, {{announced}} that in February 2008, the school administration {{was planning to}} implement a [...] "Free Speech Policy". The policy defines several things that would be considered free speech, and that students would be restricted to where they could assemble and have demonstrations or protests. This has caused serious backlash from the students, and has solicited various protests on campus and vocal dissent from the Student Government Association as well. Jenny Haley, the SGA president at the time, said the policy was not discussed nor negotiated with the SGA and that she feels {{it is a mistake}} to exclude students from the decision making process. It was also noted that during a meeting with the administration to discuss the policy, several administrators said that the only input initially solicited from students for the Free Speech policy was from a committee called the Student Leadership Council that consists of student leaders who are in charge of large student groups. Several of the students contested that not only <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>not</b> know who was on this committee, but that most of them did not even know that kind of committee even existed.|$|E
2500|$|Hooley {{claims that}} she was promised major storylines that never materialised, was asked {{to come up with}} ideas for black characters, but that all her pages of {{suggestions}} (including developing an interesting relationship with the character Dot Cotton or having Josie start her own business) were ignored. She also claims {{that she was}} only used for two-thirds of her contracted appearances. She said: [...] "In the 18 months I was in EastEnders, I had no impact. There was nothing that made people sit up and take notice of what Josie was doing. It was like they remembered I was around and threw me a line where I would slide into the bar and say, 'Hello, how are you' and then sit on a stool and say nothing {{for the rest of the}} episode. I came to feel that I was letting the black community down because my character was so empty. People of my own colour often accosted me in public and accused me of playing a token black. I was so little-used that they even wrote me cheques for episodes I never appeared in. So why <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>not</b> use me? Why are they wasting the taxpayers' money? It was very dispiriting." ...|$|E
