In Inside Story, Brian Costar and Jennifer Curtin look at the precedents FROM THE mid- 1980 s, with the growing number and influence of independent and small-party MPs in Australian parliaments, an important new ingredient emerged in state and territory politics: charters negotiated between independent MPs (or, in one case, the Greens) and the major parties as a precondition for supporting a minority government.
