[...] So did Lineberger: [...] "One gets the feeling they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>together</b> <b>for</b> years, though {{the series is}} fresh out of the box," [...] and he added, [...] "Together, they are a model couple. They have healthy banter, intense arguments, plenty of romance, and an easy comfort with each other." [...] Bernstein wrote; [...] "Paul and Vandernoot are charming separately and together". Joanne Ostrow of The Denver Post wrote that [...] "Paul and Vandernoot don't look like typical American TV-style bimbos and hunks, and for good reason. They were cast to appeal internationally." ...|$|E

He is a first cousin of Irish actor Conor Mullen. As U2 became {{increasingly}} successful, Larry Mullen had to add the suffix [...] "Junior" [...] to his surname to avoid confusion with his father, who was receiving large tax bills meant for his son. In 1995 Mullen had surgery on his back because he had been carrying an injury since The Joshua Tree tour.

500|$|MacFarlane is {{passionate about}} {{his support for}} gay rights. In 2008 he called it [...] "infuriating and idiotic" [...] that two gay {{partners}} [...] "have {{to go through this}} fucking dog and pony act when they stop at a hotel and the guy behind the counter says, 'You want one room or two?'" [...] He went on to say, [...] "I'm incredibly passionate about my support for the gay community and what they're dealing with at this current point in time". MacFarlane continued, [...] "Why is it that Johnny Spaghetti Stain in fucking Georgia can knock a woman up, legally be married to her, and then beat the shit out of her, but these two intelligent, sophisticated writers who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>together</b> <b>for</b> 20 years can't get married?" ...|$|E
500|$|A tightly-fought {{match against}} Chelsea {{at home was}} settled by a second half error by goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini, which {{presented}} Henry with his seventh league goal in nine matches. Both teams up until that point were level on points {{at the top of}} the table and unbeaten. Wenger noted after the match that Chelsea's bigger squad would serve them well as the season progressed, but stressed his smaller squad had stability: [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>together</b> <b>for</b> years and have the comfort of knowing we have won things before. When we are challenged, we become even more united." [...] Arsenal ended October with a 1–1 draw against Charlton Athletic. After 10 games, Arsenal garnered 24 points. The point earnt at Charlton was enough for the team to move back into first position, which had been occupied by Chelsea.|$|E
500|$|Rachel's (Lea Michele) second {{attempt at}} an {{original}} song, [...] "Only Child", {{proves to be}} only a small improvement over [...] "My Headband". Finn (Cory Monteith) encourages her to dig deeper into her pain to find her song. Quinn's (Dianna Agron) desire to become prom queen prompts her to get close to Rachel in order to run interference between her and Finn. In doing this, she supports Rachel's idea of writing original songs for Regionals; the members of New Directions eventually agree, due to the fact they received a cease and desist letter from My Chemical Romance saying they can't perform [...] "Sing" [...] for Regionals. Sue later admits to forging the letter in yet another attempt to sabotage the glee club. Rachel confronts Quinn about her relationship with Finn, trusting her to be honest. Quinn admits they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>together</b> <b>for</b> a couple of weeks and tells Rachel that she doesn't belong in Lima. Quinn says she will remain behind with Finn and Rachel can't hate her for helping to send her on her way. Hurt, Rachel goes home and uses Quinn's words as a springboard for writing a new song.|$|E

500|$|McKellen has {{appeared}} in limited release films, such as Emile (which was shot in three weeks following the X2 shoot), Neverwas and Asylum. He appeared as Sir Leigh Teabing in The Da Vinci Code. During a 17 May 2006 interview on The Today Show with the Da Vinci Code cast and director, Matt Lauer posed a question to the group about how they would have felt if the film had borne a prominent disclaimer {{that it is a}} work of fiction, as some religious groups wanted. McKellen responded, [...] "I've often thought the Bible should have a disclaimer in the front saying 'This is fiction.' I mean, walking on water? It takes... an act of faith. And I have faith in this movie– not that it's true, not that it's factual, but that it's a jolly good story." [...] He continued, [...] "And I think audiences are clever enough and bright enough to separate out fact and fiction, and discuss the thing when they've seen it". McKellen appeared in the 2006 BBC series of Ricky Gervais' comedy series Extras, where he played himself directing Gervais' character Andy Millman in a play about gay lovers. McKellen received a 2007 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor - Comedy Series nomination for his performance. In 2009 he portrayed Number Two in The Prisoner, a remake of the 1967 cult series The Prisoner. In 2013, McKellen co-starred in the ITV sitcom Vicious as Freddie Thornhill, alongside Derek Jacobi.

2500|$|Vladimir stands {{through most}} of the play whereas Estragon sits down {{numerous}} times and even dozes off. [...] "Estragon is inert and Vladimir restless." [...] Vladimir looks at the sky and muses on religious or philosophical matters. Estragon [...] "belongs to the stone", preoccupied with mundane things, what he can get to eat and how to ease his physical aches and pains; he is direct, intuitive. He finds it hard to remember but can recall certain things when prompted, e.g., when Vladimir asks: [...] "Do you remember the Gospels?" [...] Estragon tells Vladimir about the coloured maps of the Holy Land and that he planned to honeymoon by the Dead Sea; it is his short-term memory that is poorest and points {{to the fact that he}} may, in fact, be suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Al Alvarez writes: [...] "But perhaps Estragon's forgetfulness is the cement binding their relationship together. He continually forgets, Vladimir continually reminds him; between them they pass the time." [...] They <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>together</b> <b>for</b> fifty years but when asked–by Pozzo–they do not reveal their actual ages.|$|E
2500|$|... 2012. On July 9, 2012, the Episcopal Church {{passed a}} {{resolution}} approving an official liturgy for blessing same-sex unions. This liturgy, called “The Witnessing and Blessing of a Lifelong Covenant” offers a blessing close to marriage, but the church is {{clear that it is}} not marriage. According to Rev. Ruth Meyers, chairwoman of the Standing Commission on Liturgy and Music, “There are a lot of similarities. The couple give their consent to being joined in lifelong commitment, they exchange vows. There’s the possibility of exchanging rings, or, for couples who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>together</b> <b>for</b> some time and already have rings, to have their rings blessed. There is a blessing over the couple. But we’re clear at this point {{that this is not a}} marriage because the Episcopal Church is not in agreement in its understanding of marriage.” The resolution enables priests to bestow the church’s blessing on gay couples even if they live in a state where same-sex marriage is illegal; however, bishops who do not approve of the liturgy can prohibit their priests from using it. The resolution is provisional and will be reviewed in three years.|$|E

2500|$|A {{year after}} their wedding, Sonya and Toadie's {{marriage}} came under strain. Toadie accused Sonya of neglecting their relationship, {{when she began}} to get involved in their friends' problems. Morey said, [...] "Sonya and Toadie <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>together</b> <b>for</b> five years and, unfortunately, little things are starting to niggle - which doesn't mean they're over, or anything like that, but it's definitely causing a few issues for them." [...] Morey explained that life had slowed down for Sonya and Toadie and they were getting into [...] "the nitty gritty" [...] of their marriage, which was challenging for them both. Things became worse for Sonya and Toadie when Jacob Holmes (Clayton Watson) kissed Sonya. Morey told Kirsty Nutkins from the Daily Express, [...] "The kiss with Jacob was the first big crack in their relationship. Even though Sonya didn't have feelings for him, it hurt Toadie a lot." [...] The actress said it was uncomfortable to play out the scenes involving her character's marital problems. She also found it frustrating, as she knew Sonya in particular was not learning from her mistakes. Morey thought Sonya and Toadie could benefit from better communication, and from Sonya telling people to seek help from other sources, like a counsellor. She also thought Toadie could help his wife out more often, especially if the person she was helping was his friend too.|$|E
2500|$|Pozzo {{controls}} Lucky {{by means}} of an extremely long rope which he jerks and tugs if Lucky is the least bit slow. Lucky is the absolutely subservient slave of Pozzo and he unquestioningly does his every bidding with [...] "dog-like devotion". He struggles with a heavy suitcase without ever thinking of dropping it. Lucky speaks only once in the play and it is a result of Pozzo's order to [...] "think" [...] for Estragon and Vladimir. Pozzo and Lucky <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>together</b> <b>for</b> sixty years and, in that time, their relationship has deteriorated. Lucky has always been the intellectually superior but now, with age, he has become an object of contempt: his [...] "think" [...] is a caricature of intellectual thought and his [...] "dance" [...] is a sorry sight. Despite his horrid treatment at Pozzo's hand however, Lucky remains completely faithful to him. Even in the second act when Pozzo has inexplicably gone blind, and needs to be led by Lucky rather than driving him as he had done before, Lucky remains faithful and has not tried to run away; they are clearly bound together by more than a piece of rope {{in the same way that}} Didi and Gogo are [...] "ied to Godot". Beckett's advice to the American director Alan Schneider was: [...] " [...] is a hypomaniac and the only way to play him is to play him mad." ...|$|E

[...] He said the song talks about [...] "feeling like you're being {{stretched}} to your limits by somebody. Gaskarth visited Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo at his house and ended up co-writing [...] "I Feel Like Dancin'". He called Cuomo [...] "such a cool guy to work with." [...] Gaskarth said the track was [...] "an ode to {{having a good time}} and not taking yourself too seriously." [...] Barakat called the track [...] "a great song ... It has a cool Weezer/All Time Low/party hybrid-vibe to it." [...] Gaskarth said [...] "Forget About It" [...] details [...] "that place in a relationship where people <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>together</b> <b>for</b> a really long time and they're afraid to let go." [...] Despite this, he said it was [...] "a totally fun song." [...] Gaskarth said [...] "Guts" [...] was [...] "about finding within yourself the ability to say and do what you want no matter what the repercussions might be." [...] Maja Ivarsson from The Sounds provides guest vocals on the track. Gaskarth said Ivarsson was [...] "someone I’ve always respected vocally". He added that the pair [...] "both sound really similar ... she definitely sounds like a girl and I sorta sound like a girl so there’s a weird mix that happens but trust me it works for the song." [...] He called the track [...] "a departure for us as it's more universal and timeless than we've ever been." ...|$|E
