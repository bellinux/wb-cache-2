40|$|This Note {{argues that}} Virginia {{statutory}} and case law requiring {{the exclusion of}} prison conditions evidence in capital trials where the jury must determine defendants’ future dangerousness is unconstitutional. In Part I, I present certain portions of a <b>hypothetical</b> <b>capital</b> trial in Virginia to introduce readers to the concepts of prison conditions evidence and future dangerousness, and why they are important to capital defendants. In Part II, I trace {{the development of the}} constitutional right that is violated by the exclusion of this evidence, as well as how Virginia has come to justify its exclusionary stance based on a flawed standard of evidentiary irrelevance. In Part III, I present various legal and logical arguments against this standard of irrelevance. In Part IV, I offer explanations as to why this standard of irrelevance has remained uncorrected, and draw conclusions about a potential solution...|$|E
40|$|The CQA {{challenge}} is a 6 month competition that starts in October and ends in March. In this competition, student teams from 54 universities {{across the world}} are competing to build a long-short, market neutral equity portfolio that would generate the most risk-adjusted return in the given time horizon while operating under a few specific portfolio constraints. Each team is ranked against each other based on risk-adjusted return and sharpe ratio. Our team consisted of 5 senior finance students at the University of Arizona. Together, we developed our own unique market outlook and portfolio strategy in order to successfully invest 1, 000, 000 in (<b>hypothetical)</b> <b>capital.</b> We used industry tilts towards financials, energy, and consumer discretionary sectors and factor tilts towards momentum and value stocks as our main drivers of return while minimizing market exposure by keeping our beta between - 0. 25 and + 0. 25. The University of Arizona finished the competition in first place in overall portfolio ranking with a return of 12. 23...|$|E
40|$|Basel II, a major {{international}} regulatory capital revision, {{was supposed to have}} been implemented in the U. S. by 2004, but delays pushed it back more than five years. Basel II could have lowered minimum capital standards and made the largest banks even more vulnerable to the subprime financial crisis and economic downturn had it been adopted before its onset in 2007. Consequently, the procrastination in implementing Basel II made the banking industry more stable as it entered the financial crisis. In this study, the assets of the 11 largest bank holding companies at year-end 2006 were separated into broad asset classes with similar default characteristics as set forth under the second Basel Accord. The <b>hypothetical</b> <b>capital</b> to be held by the BHCs against their loans and leases was computed as required under Basel II and compared with the actual capital the banks held at year-end 2006. Based on these computations, it appears that Basel II would have made banks even more vulnerable to the financial crisis had it been adopted earlier. Consequently, the procrastination in implementing Basel II benefited both the banking industry and the federal government. Among the 11 bank holding companies, total capital could have decreased by more than $ 170 billion under Basel II compared to the actual capital being held. The change would have amounted to a 29. 7 % decrease in total capital and a 52. 9 % drop in capital held against loans and leases, both on a weighted-average basis. Without question, Basel II needs to be adjusted to be more conservative...|$|E
40|$|Human {{capital is}} a key {{economic}} factor in both macro- and microeconomics, and, at least for most people, by far their largest asset. We use the Substantial Gain-Loss-Ratio to calculate Good Deal bounds for securitizations of individual labour income one year ahead. Our procedure is applied to US data. We evaluate the attractiveness of <b>hypothetical</b> human <b>capital</b> contracts and can thereby identify investors' favourites...|$|R
40|$|This paper refines a {{theoretical}} model of capitalist reproduction. A compact statespace {{form of this}} model defines a <b>hypothetical</b> Law of <b>capital</b> accumulation. The state variables are the unit wage, employment ratio, gross unit rent, man-made capitaloutput ratio, natural capital-output ratio, indicated natural capital-output ratio, and unit depreciation of the natural capital. An application of an extended Kalman filtering to the US macroeconomic data 1958 - 1991 identifies unobservable components of this Law. It is shown that long wave is a dominant non-equilibrium quasi-periodic behavioural pattern of the US capital accumulation. Evaluating the historical fit through appropriate summary statistics and long-range forecasting strengthen confidence in the model...|$|R
40|$|In general, banks play a growth-enhancing {{role for}} the real economy. However, {{distorted}} incentives for banks, depositors, and regulators in connection with bank insolvency may corrupt banks' credit allocation and monitoring decisions, leading to suboptimal real economic outcomes. A rules-based prompt resolution regime for insolvent banks may reestablish the incentive system and provide for economically superior credit allocation and monitoring. We test the hypothesis that regulatory insolvency has a cathartic effect using a large firm-level dataset and proposing a new indicator to measure the strength of catharsis. Employing an instrumental variable setup and an interaction approach, we try to overcome concerns about causality and potential endogeneity which are usually inherent to research into the real economic implications of bank regulation. We find a comparably stronger implementation of a <b>hypothetical</b> positive <b>capital</b> closure rule {{to have a positive}} and statistically as well as economically significant effect on individual firm growth - particularly for firms that are structurally more dependent on bank financing. Our findings are robust to various specifications. Investigating the transmission channels of the 'catharsis effect', we find that it essentially works through benefiting better quality firms and reallocating credit towards firms that need it most. Additional analyses suggest that the 'catharsis effect' works best in open banking systems that provide high access to international finance and, hence, mitigate potentially negative credit supply effects of insolvent bank liquidation. Taken together, our findings advocate stronger attention being given to incentive-compatible bank resolution regimes...|$|R
40|$|A {{model of}} the {{sequence}} of decisions required for mine development and production has been formulated and is operated as a computer-based game. The Mine Manager is an operations research game in which the user assumes the role of mine management in the exploitation of a mineral deposit. Potential applications of the game lie in experimentation, policy formulation and education in mine economics. The Mine Manager is described using the terminology of games. The selection of parameters and {{of the level of}} detail in the model reflects a compromise between realism and simplicity. At the development stage, the selection of project specifications concerns the mining method and capacity installation. Decisions on cut-off grade and/or cut-off value, capacity utilization, the sequence of mining, stockpiling and expansion are made during the mine life. Decision making takes place within a framework provided by an abstraction of the operating environment of a mine, and must comply with a set of rules. These rules ensure that only feasible decisions are made. Within this constraint, the model offers a high degree of flexibility in setting the values of the decision variables. The Mine Manager combines elements of geology, mining, management and gaming. Conditional simulation is used to generate grades of copper, zinc and gold in a massive sulphide deposit. Mining operations in both underground and open-pit mines are modelled, and <b>hypothetical</b> <b>capital</b> and operating cost functions are developed for the mine and mill. A pricing model generates new price series for each run of the game. The Mine Manager is operated interactively on a microcomputer through the use of modular software. The user interface and a sample run of the game are described, and the information displays created by the game are presented...|$|E
40|$|In particular, I {{argue that}} {{complaints}} of commentators that his account lacks empirical verification are misplaced. Weber’s narrative in The Protestant Ethic does not {{function as an}} historical explanation {{of the origins of}} capitalism that can be tested against a body of facts. Rather, using the ideal-type, it seeks to give a plausible account of how modern capitalism could have arisen, or, more accurately, how an agent motivated to rationally accumulate capital could have arisen so as to launch as a byproduct of that agent’s activity a system of social relations that can accumulate capital without requiring an entrepreneurial type to move it along. Thus, the deliberately constructed and self-referential nature of Weber’s genetic concepts, especially of the Calvinist ethic and the capitalist ‘spirit’, is a strength, not a weakness of his account. This can be seen if we read this work against two rival generic <b>hypothetical</b> accounts of <b>capital</b> accumulation, those of Adam Smith and marginalism...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper re-defines three <b>hypothetical</b> laws of <b>capital</b> {{accumulation}} including endoge-nous rate of accumulation and {{capital-output ratio}} as state variables. An original non-linear relation-ship relates their growth rates. Other main state variables are output per worker, employment ratio and relative labour compensation. A comprehensive Phillips equation, governing real labour compen-sation, {{is an element}} of the initial hypothetical law (HL- 1). HL- 2 substitutes the former equation by a new one that reflects a long-term tendency of relative labour compensation to fall. A capital strive to maximal profit alters HL- 2 in 2008. An alternative control law (HL- 3) determines a growth rate of sur-plus value by a gap between target and current employment ratios while an integral absolute diver-gence of relative labour compensation from the average one for 1979 – 2008 is minimised. Based on the US macroeconomic data mainly for 1969 – 2008, computer simulation runs for a later period (through 2062) exhibit how an application of HL- 3 in 2008 and afterwards could alleviate se-verity of the current crisis in the restructured US economy compared to evolution based on altered HL- 2. The recovery from the present structural crisis of capital accumulation, worst after the World War II, will last until 2011 – 2013 when the pre-crisis maximum of net output is restored and until 2014 – 2017 when the pre-crisis maximum of employment is reached again...|$|R
40|$|This paper re-defines two <b>hypothetical</b> laws of <b>capital</b> {{accumulation}} {{by including}} endogenous profit investment share and establishing an explicit inverse relation between this share and capital-output ra-tio. Other main state variables are labour productivity, employment ratio and unit value of labour force. A comprehensive Phillips equation, governing real labour compensation, {{is an element}} of a hypotheti-cal law (HL-IR). A control law (CL-IR) determines a growth rate of surplus value by a gap between target and current employment ratios. A capital strive to higher profitability alters HL-IR and CL-IR. After the recent neo-conservative defeat there is, likely, no place for stabilising policy with the same or similar aggressiveness as in 2002 – 2007. Based on the US macroeconomic data mainly for 1969 – 2007, computer simulation runs for a later period (through 2060) exhibit how a postponed non-aggressive application of altered CL-IR in 2012 and afterwards could smooth out long waves of capital accumulation and shorten a period of fluctuations from 24 – 30 to 14 – 16 years in the restructured US economy compared to evolution based on HL-IR altered in 2008. The present stern crisis of the capital accumulation, probably worst after the World War II, will last until 2018 – 2022 when the pre-crisis maximum of net output is restored and 2023 – 2026 when the pre-crisis maximum of employment is reached again...|$|R
