The probe is elongated and has a plurality of seals spaced therealong and sealed to {{the walls of the}} side hole to form a plurality of chambers sealed from one another. A tracer fluid injector on the probe can inject a tracer fluid into one of the chambers, while a tracer fluid detector located in another chamber can detect the tracer fluid, to thereby sense the permeability of the strata surrounding the side hole.

Conductivity is estimated in part from outflow rates, induced by a constant hydraulic head, monitored over three meter intervals in boreholes which are oriented in a manner so as to intersect the major fracture sets of a field site. Outflow rates are monitored {{by means of a}} falling-head flowmeter while borehole intervals are isolated with a single <b>inflatable</b> <b>packer.</b> Upon collection of the field data, hydraulic conductivity values are estimated by means of two analytical solutions. The solutions are adapted to meet the special conditions posed by variable borehole orientations and multiple test intervals from existing solutions associated with borehole permeability tests.

The geologic formation is modeled as an unbounded homogeneous isotropic linear elastic solid containing an infinitely long circular cavity, while the packer is modeled as a semi-infinite thin-walled circular cylindrical shell. For given packer properties, these induced stresses are shown {{to depend on}} the difference between packer pressure and fracturing pressure and can become significant. Typical numerical results are obtained and presented graphically. Analytical approximations for the maximum values of these stresses are also presented.

40|$|Tracer {{and pump}} tests {{including}} depth dependent water sampling {{were performed to}} investigate the flow conditions inside and {{in the vicinity of}} an injection well with two screen segments used for subsurface iron removal (SIR). A high resolution groundwater flow model of the well and the adjacent aquifer with vertically varying dissolved iron concentration was calibrated and used to plan measures to manipulate the vertical outflow distribution of injected oxygen enriched water. The optimized injection regime was adopted in a pilot SIR test with the aim of increasing the treatment efficacy through a depth specific injection of water using an <b>inflatable</b> <b>packer.</b> When water was injected conventionally above the pump, the outward migration of the oxygen enriched water was non-uniform and disproportional to the iron concentration and resulted in an early iron breakthrough in the lower screen. The proportion of water injected into the lower iron-rich part of the aquifer increased as a packer was placed inside the well to seal 4 / 5 of the upper well screen length. Thereby, the efficiency coefficient increased by 50 % and iron removal by 25 %. The treatment efficiency at the site suffered from low alkalinity and pH-values below 5. Higher efficiency coefficients may have been achieved by the addition of alkalis prior to injection...|$|E
40|$|Brookhaven National Laboratory was {{requested}} {{to conduct a}} literature survey for the best available cement {{to use in the}} proposed casing patch as part of the Geothermal Drilling Organization (GDO) project on remediation of deformed casings. A total of 50 wells has been identified with deformed production casing in Unocal's portion of The Geysers geothermal field. Reduced internal diameter and casing doglegs result in lost production and the possible need for abandonment. The cause of the deformations is believed to be formation movement along fault planes and/or along weaker layers or interfaces between high impedance contrast media. Apparently, it is unclear whether shear or axial compression is the dominant failure mechanism. A procedure to address the casing deformation and avoid abandonment of these wells has been developed as described in the Geysers Deformed Casing Remediation Proposal. The proposed remediation procedure involves isolation of the zone of interest with an <b>inflatable</b> <b>packer,</b> milling the deformed casing and cementing a 7 inch diameter liner to extend approximately 100 ft above and 100 ft below the milled zone. During the milling operation {{it is possible that the}} original cement and surrounding formation may slough away. In order to specify a suitable cement formulation for the casing patch it is first necessary to identify and understand the deformation mechanism/s operating in The Geysers field. Subsequently, the required cement mechanical properties to withstand further deformation of the repaired system must be defined. From this information it can be determined whether available cement formulations meet these requirements. In addition to The Geysers, other geothermal fields are at possible risk of casing deformation due to subsidence, seismic activity, lateral and vertical formation movement or other processes. Therefore, the proposed remediation procedure may have applications in other fields. The literature survey focused on published properties for cements used in geothermal and oil well applications and the experiences of well casing deformation occurring in oil and gas fields.

40|$|Savannah River Site {{personnel}} {{are planning a}} two phase program in order to significantly {{reduce the amount of}} dissolved chlorinated solvents that are being transported to the McQueen branch Aquifer via the wellbore and gravel pack zones of the A/M Area production well system. In Phase I of the program a commercially available <b>inflatable</b> <b>packer</b> and check valve assembly will be installed inside the casing at the altitude of the McQueen Branch Confining Unit. This immediate, short term solution will eliminate the majority of the contaminant mass that is moving downward through the wellbore of the A/M Area production wells. During the packer installation process several pre- and post- testing activities are planned to aid SRS investigators in understanding the dynamics of the flow conditions and effectiveness of the installed assembly. The second phase of the program will address the small amount of contaminant mass that is moving downward through the continuous gravel pack of the production wells. The investigative data obtained during Phase I of this program will be beneficial for developing plans and appropriate actions for the Phase II activities. Site {{personnel are}} currently evaluating various options, i. e. casing perforation with grout injection or partial well abandonment, to eliminate the downward flow in the gravel pack at the altitude of the McQueen Branch Confining Zone. In addressing potential remediation actions for the dissolved solvents in the Cretaceous sediments, due to the limited vertical extent of the plume and the size, any remediation program should incorporate carefully located wells screened vertically within the plume trajectory. This optimizing approach will minimize water treatment and pumping costs and maximize the amount of contaminant removal. Flow and contaminant transport modeling scenarios are currently being developed to address the Cretaceous sediments. These efforts involve incorporating the available characterization data and the results of previous modeling work to more precisely define the extent and magnitude of this plume. SRS proposes incorporating depth discrete sampling during any future characterization effort to optimize any proposed remediation system. Finally, by using a full three-dimensional model rather than the traditional quasi-three dimensional methods an efficient remediation system can be developed...|$|E

To test for leaks, <b>inflatable</b> <b>packers</b> were used to seal the well casing. Laboratory testing determined that the packers could contain a casing pressure up to 50 to 60 psi (345 to 414 kpa) less than the packer inflation pressure. Single- and double-packer configurations were successfully field tested in 32 wells ranging from 500 to 530 ft (153 to 162 m) in depth. A rigid pipeline and a hoist truck were used to run the packers {{in and out of}} the wells for the double-packer tests, which averaged 2 1 / 4 h each. In an effort to decrease the time of the rigid-pipe double- packer test, a self-contained trailer-mounted test system was designed and built. It utilizes a winch and steel cable to run the packers {{in and out of the}} well and high-pressure nylon tubing for packer inflation. This system was successfully field tested in eight wells averaging 650 ft (198 m) in depth and resulted in a time savings of 13 pct and an operator-hour reduction of 42 pct.

40|$|The Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) {{conducted}} field-scale {{hydraulic conductivity}} testing of simulated buried waste sites with improved confinement. The improved confinement {{was achieved by}} jet grouting the buried waste, thus creating solid monoliths. The hydraulic conductivity of the monoliths was determined using both the packer technique and the falling head method. The testing was performed on simulated buried waste sites utilizing a variety of encapsulating grouts, including high-sulfate-resistant Portland cement, TECT, (a proprietary iron oxide cement) and molten paraffin. By creating monoliths using in-situ jet grouting of encapsulating materials, the waste is simultaneously protected from subsidence and contained against further migration of contaminants. At the INEL alone there is 56, 000 m{sup 3 } of buried transuranic waste commingled with 170, 000 [...] 224, 000 m{sup 3 } of soil in shallow land burial. One of the options for this buried waste {{is to improve the}} confinement and leave it in place for final disposal. Knowledge of the hydraulic conductivity for these monoliths is important for decision-makers. The packer tests involved coring the monolith, sealing off positions within the core with <b>inflatable</b> <b>packers,</b> applying pressurized water to the matrix behind the seal, and observing the water flow rate.

40|$|A {{series of}} multi-zone pumping tests was {{conducted}} in a contaminated fractured rock aquifer in the Western Siberian Basin, Ozyorsk, Russia. The tests were conducted adjacent to the Mishelyak River floodplain in fractured Paleozoic porphyrites, tufts, tuff breccia, and lava typical of the Ural mountain complex. Geophysical logs, borehole photography, core samples, and results from previous borehole contamination studies were used to identify the zones to be tested. A network of three uncased wells was tested using a system of <b>inflatable</b> <b>packers,</b> pressure transducers and data loggers. Seven zones were isolated and monitored {{in two of the}} uncased wells. A straddle packer assembly was used to isolate individual zones within the pumping well. Eight constant rate pumping tests were conducted. Results of the testing indicate that shallow groundwater migrates primarily in two intervals that are separated by an interval with low lateral conductivity. The water bearing intervals have moderate to high specific capacities (1. 3 and 30 L/min/m). Several processes are responsible for fracturing present in the lower interval. The network of compound fractures produced a complex array of fracture intersections yielding a fractured media with hydraulic behavior similar to porous media. Models used for the analysis of pumping tests in porous media provide a good estimation of the hydraulic response of the lower interval to pumping. Future work will include more complex analysis of the data to determine hydraulic conductivity ellipses...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{important}} aspect of the risk associated with geological carbon dioxide sequestration is the integrity of existing wellbores that penetrate geological layers targeted for CO 2 injection. CO 2 leakage may occur through multiple pathways along a wellbore within the “disturbed zone” surrounding the well casing. The disturbed zone is defined as the annular region along the exterior of the steel wellbore casing that includes the Portland cement sheath, the damage zone of the host rock and the casing-cement-rock interfaces. The effective permeability of this zone is a key parameter of wellbore integrity required for validation of numerical models. Effective permeability may depend on a number of complex factors, including long-term attack by aggressive fluids, poor well completion or actions related to production of fluids through the wellbore. Field tests are essential to understanding the in situ leakage properties of the millions of wells that exist in mature sedimentary basins in North America. We present results from recent field studies of different CO 2 producing wells from both natural CO 2 reservoirs and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operations. These surveys have included a particular downhole pressure test, the vertical interference test (VIT), designed {{to determine the extent of}} hydraulic communication along the exterior of the well casing. The VIT test involves perforating the well casing in two separate intervals, both of which are located within the shale caprock and bracket a zone of cement identified to have a lower quality bond. Once the intervals are isolated with an <b>inflatable</b> <b>packer,</b> the system is pressurized from surface and held at a constant pressure, while simultaneously, the transient pressure response is measured in the lower isolated interval. The pressure transient data is an indicator of the extent of hydraulic communication and is the focus of subsequent analysis. The effective wellbore permeability can be determined through numerical analysis of the VIT data. Our objective is to identify to most effective method of analysis for estimating wellbore permeability. We evaluate two different automated parameter estimation methods, nonlinear regression and shuffled complex evolution metropolis methods. Within this study, we also estimate parameters such as permeability and compressibility of the low permeability shale zone to determine their effect on the resulting estimate of wellbore permeability. The results of this work demonstrate that parameter estimation can be effective at identifying the key parameters associated with wellbore integrity from VIT field tests, and ultimately reducing the uncertainty regarding the integrity of existing wellbores...|$|E
40|$|The Valhall {{field is}} the largest field that BP {{operates}} on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, {{and is one of}} the most well known high porosity chalk fields in the Southern part of the North Sea. During many years of oil production, there has been compaction of the reservoir. The current casing design at Valhall has developed with time as the field has matured, and is affected by several considerations like casing shear in the overburden due to subsidence, non-uniform loading in the reservoir due to chalk production and compaction. The main objective of this thesis was to develop options that could be included in the current casing design, to guarantee a higher injection pressure than is available today at the Valhall field. The current design is limiting the maximum injection pressure in the water injectors, and the main factor is the use of 95 / 8 ” drilling liner combined with a cement squeeze job through a C-Flex port collar. This cement job is not approved as a barrier element as required by NORSOK. The injection pressure is today limited by the strength of the 133 / 8 ” casing shoe, which is lower than desired. The study involves reviewing BP’s casing design manual, the current casing design on Valhall, the special requirements for Valhall, and investigating several technologies that could provide potential solutions to the barrier challenges on Valhall. The recommended option is to include the External Sleeve <b>Inflatable</b> <b>Packer</b> Collar (ESIPC), Cement Assurance Tool and the C-Flex in the 95 / 8 ” drilling liner. The ESIPC would provide a good cement job in the liner annulus, as it would enable returns to be observed during the cement job, providing evidence that there is a cement column behind the drilling liner by a cement bond log. The C-Flex is included to make it possible to perform a cement squeeze job through the C-Flex additionally to the ESIPC or in worst case alone if the ESIPC fails. The Cement Assurance Tool is just an extra safety in case the cement around the liner would contract and make a micro-annulus, which could create a possible leak. This option would most likely provide a barrier element according to NORSOK. This barrier element is very important to be able to increase the injection pressure at a wanted level, which is approximately 6, 300 psi. At present time, the ESIPC is not strong enough to be included in a drilling liner. It has to be reinforced and tested before it could be included in the drilling liner to be able to withstand the large forces acting on the tool. The corresponding dual bottom-top wiper plug set has to be reinforced as well, because the plug set would be exposed to large forces during the losses, and when it is set inside the ESIPC...|$|E

This paper describes a CO 2 -ECBM field trial using a multi-lateral horizontal well for injection. The trial, preforemed in China's Ordos basin, involved transport of liquid CO 2 to the injection site and pumping of this directly into the injection well. A u-tube sampling system was installed in a monitoring well approximately 20 m from the main horizontal branch close to the vertical section of the injection well. This u-tube system comprised three intervals separated by <b>inflatable</b> <b>packers</b> from which gas and water samples were automatically collected and recovered to an on-site field laboratory for gas analysis. The middle interval of this packer assembly sampled the target coal seam. At the start of injection a pulse of a non- adsorbing tracer gas was added to the CO 2. There was clear breakthrough of the tracer in the middle packer interval of the monitoring well demonstrating the good connection between injection and monitoring wells. The CO 2 composition of the gas sample from the coal seam gradually increased over time as injected CO 2 migrated to the monitoring well. Some significant aspects of this trial are the use of a multi-lateral horizontal well for ECBM, tracer gas in coal bed methane, the monitoring of gas displacement during ECBM and the u-tube sampling system...|$|R

40|$|We {{conducted}} {{a series of}} in-situ tests in the Climax Stock, an intrusive granite formation at the Nevada Test Site, to validate the concept of housing a nuclear waste repository in granitic crystalline rock. The thermal properties of the granite were measured with resistance heaters and thermocouple frames that had been emplaced in drilled holes in the floor of a drift 420 m below the surface. Data analysis was performed primarily by comparing the measured and calculated temperature histories, varying conductivity and diffusivity in the calculations until reasonable agreement was achieved. The best-fit value for in-situ conductivity was approximately 3. 1 W/m x K, and the deduced value for in-situ diffusivity was approximately 1. 2 mm{sup 2 }/s. Anisotropic effects in the thermal field were less than 10 %. Permeability was determined by sealing off portions of the drilled holes, using <b>inflatable</b> rubber <b>packers</b> and an air-pressurization system. We then compared the resulting decay in pressure with analytic solutions of the pressure loss from a cylindrical source in an infinite isotropic medium, obtaining a permeability of approximately 1 nanodarcy (nD) at about 30 {sup 0 }C. As the temperature increased, the permeability decreased to about 0. 2 nD at about 50 {sup 0 }C and became too small to measure (< 0. 02 nD) at higher temperatures. These tests provided new data on the in-situ properties of a granite typical of the Basin and Range province and significantly advanced our understanding of and ability to perform in-situ thermal and permeability measurements.

40|$|The {{combination}} of low permeability, oil base mud and near saturated oils presents {{one of the}} most challenging environments for fluid sampling with formation testers. Low permeability indicates that the drawdown while sampling will be high but this is contraindicated for oils that are close to saturation pressure. A logical response is to therefore reduce the flow rate but in wells drilled with OBM an unacceptably long clean-up time would result. The Pinda formation in Block 2 offshore Angola presents just such a challenge. Formation mobilities are in the low double or singledigits, saturation pressure is usually within a few hundred psi of formation pressure and borehole stability indicates that the wells must be drilled with oil base mud. In the course of several penetrations of the Pinda formation a number of attempts were made to acquire representative formation samples but were stymied due to either excessive drawdowns that corrupted the fluid or by excessive contamination levels that rendered the samples unsuitable for laboratory analysis. Clearly a more flexible solution was required. In this paper we review the results from previous attempts in the Pinda. We show the pre-job modeling that was done to predict the required flow rates and the anticipated drawdowns. Ultimately a two-step solution was used. We first ran a high efficiency pretestonly WFT in order to quickly gather formation pressure data and mobility data.

40|$|The {{bacteria}} colonizing geologic core sections (attached) were {{contrasted with}} those found {{suspended in the}} groundwater (unattached) by examining the microbiology of 16 depth-paired core and groundwater samples using a suite of culture-independent and culture-dependent analyses. One hundred twenty-two meters was continuously cored from a buried chalcopyrite ore hosted in a biotite-quartz-monzonite porphyry at the Mineral Park Mine near Kingman, Ariz. Every fourth 1. 5 -m core was acquired using microbiologically defensible methods, and these core sections were aseptically processed for characterization of the attached bacteria. Groundwater samples containing unattached bacteria were collected from the uncased corehole at depth intervals corresponding to the individual cores using an <b>inflatable</b> straddle <b>packer</b> sampler. The groundwater was acidic (pH 2. 8 to 5. 0), {{with low levels of}} dissolved oxygen and high concentrations of sulfate and metals, including ferrous iron. Total numbers of attached cells were less than 10 ⁵ cells g of core material¯¹ while unattached cells numbered about 10 ⁵ cells ml of groundwater¯¹. Attached and unattached acidophilic heterotrophs were observed throughout the depth profile. In contrast, acidophilic chemolithotrophs were not found attached to the rock but were commonly observed in the groundwater. Attached communities were composed of low numbers (< 40 CFU g¯¹) of neutrophilic heterotrophs that exhibited a high degree of morphologic diversity, while unattached communities contained higher numbers (ca. 10 ³ CFU ml¯¹) of neutrophilic heterotrophs of limited diversity. Sulfate-reducing bacteria were restricted to the deepest samples of both core and groundwater. 16 S ribosomal DNA sequence analysis of attached, acidophilic isolates indicated that organisms closely related to heterotrophic, acidophilic mesophiles such as Acidiphilium organovorum and, surprisingly, to the moderately thermophilic Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius were present.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{request of}} freshwater in coastal areas due to intense anthropization has intensified {{the research on}} saltwater intrusion. A sustainable groundwater management requires the estimation of some fundamental aquifer parameters (such as hydraulic conductivity) and their variability in order to quantify the magnitude and direction of groundwater fluxes. In case of saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers also the vertical variability of groundwater quality is fundamental since seawater is characterized by elevated density and viscosity with respect to freshwater and this feature induces density driven flow within the aquifers. For these reasons there is the need of cost- and time-effective techniques to define real physical parameters and dynamics of the aquifer. In this study we present the methodology developed via straddle low pressure packers to characterize simultaneously vertical hydraulic gradients, permeability, and groundwater quality in standard fully penetrating piezometers. The methodology uses two <b>inflatable</b> <b>packers</b> to isolate a window of 0. 2 m. The original instrument has been modified by positioning a Levelogger LTC Solinst within the sampling window. The Levelogger monitors head, temperature and electrical conductivity every 1 second. In line with the packers is connected a centrifuge pump with a flow controller. The system is set at the desired depth within the piezometer and the packers are inflated by a portable air compressor. Before to start the pumping test, the inflated packers system is left to stand until the piezometric equilibrium, monitored by phreatimeter, is reached. Once the piezometer equilibrium is restored and the point head measurement is recorded, a constant rate pumping test is performed using a flowmeter; or whenever the flux is very low, the outflow rate can be monitored by a litre counter and chronometer. The methodology has been applied on several piezometers of the regional monitoring network of the Emilia-Romagna Regio. The 2 ” piezometers are fully screened with a geotextile sock instead of gravel pack, to prevent short-circuits during the pumping tests. The Levelogger LTC records simultaneously the piezometric drawdown induced by pumping and any variations in temperature and electrical conductivity within the aquifer window isolated by the packers. From these data, the equivalent freshwater head and intrinsic permeability values can be derived. During the pumping test the piezometric head can also be monitored by Leveloggers placed {{above and below the}} packers; this allows to verify if there is any pressure drop within the piezometer due to a defective isolation of the packers. Finally, groundwater sample can be collected as soon as the pumping test has completed without removing the straddle packer. The use of a Hydrolab flow cell connected to the Hydrolab MS- 5 probe also permits to acquire in situ the other hydrochemical parameters (i. e. dissolved oxygen, pH, and redox potential), which are not recorded by the Levelogger. The results of pumping test obtained using the packers system have been compared with the intrinsic permeability calculated by pedotransfer formulas. The comparison shows a general agreement along each piezometer profile. Although, the major discrepancies have been found in peat layers, where the grain size characterization is particularly challenging due to the organic nature of these sediments. The proposed methodology is relevant for a detailed characterization of coastal aquifer parameters and flow dynamics. Application of this integrated method permits to simultaneously perform groundwater sampling, groundwater quality control and aquifer testing. Intrinsic permeability and multilevel equivalent freshwater heads can be easily calculated from acquired data and vertical gradient in the aquifer can be highlighted. Moreover this technique makes the data available during the monitoring phases and it can be integrated with other techniques of vertical investigations. It is a cost- and time-effective technique that is able to optimize the phase of aquifer characterization with the phase of groundwater monitoring and sampling. The major issue associated with the presented technique is the hydraulic tightness of the packers that has to be verified before each measure; once that is done, the methodology allows multilevel groundwater sampling in a single monitoring campaign...|$|R
40|$|Wireline Mini-Fracture testing jobs {{consist of}} a short duration, small volume {{fracturing}} operation inside an open-hole borehole, where {{a certain amount of}} fluid is injected into the formation at constant rate using a Wireline Modular conveyed tool as a source of hydraulic power to pressurize the wellbore. The tool is configured with an <b>inflatable</b> straddle <b>packer</b> and an internal pump, which inflate/deflates the packers and supplies pressure to the formation until a hydraulic fracture is induced. This procedure is used to determine in–situ formation breakdown and closure pressure also known as minimum horizontal closure pressure. This provides vital information regarding hydraulic fracture design, water and gas injection management, fault re-activation, wellbore stability, sand production, rock mechanical properties, casing string design, cap and base rock integrity and gas storage design. Geomechanical and operational parameters such as, elastic properties, poro-elasticity, rock strength, formation pore pressure, far field horizontal stress, permeability/porosity distributions, borehole fluid properties among others, influences the performance of the Mini-Frac Jobs. In many cases poor understanding of the reservoir response to the fracture process, caused that the hydraulic fracture did not propagate deep into the formation. In other cases the pressure applied to the formation might be insufficient to break down the formation, leading to unsatisfactory application of the Mini-Fracture technique in the process. The objective of this thesis is to develop a Mini-Facture application simulator that uses the geomechanical and operational parameters that control the performance of a Mini-Fracture job and estimate the possibility of the occurrence of a tensile failure in the formation. The simulator is then validated by comparing its output with the results of stress test done in the field. With this simulator petrotechnical professionals and field engineers will have a platform that simulates the pressure responses and fracture initialization during Mini-Frac treatments, incorporating all the variables affecting a Wireline Mini-Fracture job, helping the design engineer to make key decisions about the ultimate or required fracture plan. Furthermore the simulator will reduce the uncertainties that limit the reliability of the Wireline Mini-Fracture treatment by allowing the selection of appropriate tool configuration based on the job objectives and the geological environmental conditions. Finally this project demonstrates that combining the appropriate constitutive relations that reflect the coupling among the tool operational performance with wellbore flow, reservoir and geomechanics modelling a Mini-Fracture simulator can be developed.

40|$|An <b>inflatable</b> drill-string <b>packer</b> {{was used}} at Site 839 {{to measure the}} bulk in-situ {{permeability}} within basalts cored in Hole 839 B. The packer was inflated at two depths, 398. 2 and 326. 9 mbsf; all on-board information indicated that the packer mechanically closed off the borehole, although apparently the packer hydraulically sealed the borehole only at 398. 2 mbsf. Two pulse tests were run at each depth, two constant-rate injection tests were run at the first set, and four were run at the second. Of these, only the constant-rate injection tests at the first set yielded a permeability, calculated as ranging from 1 to 5 * 10 **- 12 m** 2. Pulse tests and constant-rate injection tests for the second set did not yield valid data. The measured permeability is an upper limit; if the packer leaked during the experiments, the basalt would be less permeable. In comparison, permeabilities measured at other Deep Sea Drilling Project and Ocean Drilling Program sites in pillow basalts and flows similar to those measured in Hole 839 B are mainly about 10 **- 13 to 10 **- 14 m** 2. Thus, if our results are valid, the basalts at Site 839 are more permeable than ocean-floor basalts investigated elsewhere. Based on other supporting evidence, we consider these results to be a valid measure of the permeability of the basalts. Temperature data and the geochemical and geotechnical properties of the drilled sediments all indicate that the site is strongly affected by fluid flow. The heat flow is very much less than expected in young oceanic basalts, probably a result of rapid fluid circulation through the crust. The geochemistry of pore fluids {{is similar to that}} of seawater, indicating seawater flow through the sediments, and sediments are uniformly underconsolidated for their burial depth, again indicating probable fluid flow. The basalts are highly vesicular. However, the vesicularity can only account for part of the average porosity measured on the neutron porosity well log; the remainder of the measured porosity is likely present as voids and fractures within and between thin-bedded basalts. Core samples, together with porosity, density, and resistivity well-log data show locations where the basalt section is thin bedded and probably has from 15 % to 35 % void and fracture porosity. Thus, the measured permeability seems reasonable with respect to the high measured porosity. Much of the fluid flow at Site 839 could be directed through highly porous and permeable zones within and between the basalt flows and in the sediment layer just above the basalt. Thus, the permeability measurements give an indication of where and how fluid flow may occur within the oceanic crust of the Lau Basin...|$|R
