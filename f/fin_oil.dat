40|$|At the Lille {{center of}} the ONERA the fine {{characterization}} of complex flows has been a specificity known {{for more than twenty}} year, starting with an existing system, developing an optical method based on differential interferometry using Wollaston prism and a white polarized light source. A new schlieren interferometer has been build to analyze the unsteady flows and a lot of studies have been conducted where the unsteady pressure measurements have been simultaneously recorded with high speed visualizations. Several applications are presented in two-dimensional and axisymmetric flows and in a gaseous mixture where the two gases interface is submitted to acceleration. Another application concerns the evaluation of the skin friction coefficient from the color interference fringes obtained under white light by a <b>fin</b> <b>oil</b> film on a flat plate. Moreover, the quasi-automatic exploitation of color interferograms is based on the modeling of interference fringes versus the optical path difference, so that each pixel can be replaced by a value of refractive index. Finally, as differential interferometry produces the first derivative of the refractive index, real-time color holographic interferometry (RCHI) has been developed to obtain the refractive index itself. In this technique, the light source is made of three wavelengths (one red, one green and one blue) from a mixed gas (argon and krypton) laser. High resolution panchromatic holograms are recorded b...|$|E

500|$|This {{species is}} taken by {{commercial}} and artisanal longline and gillnet fisheries throughout its range. It is valued for meat, leather, liver oil, and fishmeal. The Caribbean reef shark {{is the most}} common shark landed in Colombia (accounting for 39% of the longline catch by occurrence), where it is utilized for its <b>fins,</b> <b>oil,</b> and jaws (sold for ornamental purposes). In Belize, this species is mainly caught as bycatch on hook-and-line intended for groupers and snappers; the fins are sold to the lucrative Asian market and the meat sold in Belize, Mexico, and Guatemala to make [...] "panades", a tortilla-like confection. A dedicated shark fishery operated in Belize from the mid-1900s to the early 1990s, until catches of all species saw dramatic declines.

5|$|Spinner {{sharks are}} swift and gregarious predators that feed {{on a wide}} variety of small bony fishes and cephalopods. When feeding on schools of forage fish, they will speed {{vertically}} through the school while spinning on their axis, erupting from the water at the end. Like other members of its family, the spinner shark is viviparous, with females bearing litters of three to 20 young every other year. The newborns are born in shallow nursery areas near the coast, and are relatively fast-growing. This species is not usually dangerous to humans, but may become belligerent when excited by food. Spinner sharks are valued by commercial fisheries across their range for their meat, <b>fins,</b> liver <b>oil,</b> and skin. They are also esteemed as strong fighters by recreational fishers. The IUCN has assessed this species as Near Threatened worldwide and Vulnerable off the southeastern United States.|$|R

50|$|John Smith {{had left}} the Jamestown {{adventure}} but he still believed in the colonial enterprise and craved the excitement of sea-borne adventure. In 1614 he associated himself {{with a group of}} adventurers under Captain Marmeduke Roydon who appointed him head of an expedition of two vessels to Northern Virginia. The commercial purpose was to take whales for <b>fins</b> and <b>oil</b> and to seek out mines of gold or copper. In the event those purposes failed, they were to obtain sufficient fish to defray the cost of the voyage. Whaling soon proved impractical; they had no way to kill the whales, and the whales were the wrong kinds anyway. No one had any expertise in finding gold mines, so in the end the voyage came down to obtaining fish and furs to defray the expense. Most of the crew spent their time fishing, while Smith and eight others took a small boat on a coasting expedition during which for trifles he was able to obtain 11,000 beaver skins and 100 each of martins and otters.|$|R

25|$|There {{are several}} factors {{contributing}} to {{the decline in the}} population of the sand tigers. Sand tigers reproduce at an unusually low rate, {{due to the fact that}} they do not have more than two pups at a time and because they breed only every second or third year. This shark is a highly prized food item in the western northern Pacific, off Ghana and off India and Pakistan where they are caught by fishing trawlers, although they are more commonly caught with a fishing line. Sand tigers' fins are a popular trade item in Japan. Off North America, it is fished for its hide and <b>fins.</b> Shark liver <b>oil</b> is a popular product in cosmetic products such as lipstick. It is sought by anglers in fishing competitions in South Africa and some other countries. In Australia it has been reduced in numbers by spear fishers using poison and where it is now protected. It is also prized as an aquarium exhibit in the United States, Europe, Australia and South Africa because of its docile and hardy nature. Thus, overfishing is a major contributor to the population decline. All indications show that the world population in sand tigers has been reduced significantly in size since 1980. Many sand tigers are caught in shark nets, and then either strangled or taken by fishermen. Estuaries along the United States of America's eastern Atlantic coast houses many of the young sand tiger sharks. These estuaries are susceptible to non-point source pollution that is harmful to the pups.|$|R
40|$|Historically sharks {{have been}} seen either {{as a source of}} income through harvesting, or as a {{nuisance}} and danger. The economic value of sharks has traditionally been measured as the total value of sharks caught for liver <b>oil,</b> <b>fins,</b> or meat for consumption. Sharks have also been killed to near extinction in cases where they were seen as a threat to fisheries on other species. This is illustrated by the mass extermination of Basking Sharks (Cetorhinus maximus) in British Columbia. They were seen as a nuisance to fishermen as they got entangled in gill nets during the salmon fishing season. However with the development of the SCUBA diving industry, and ecotourism in general, increased awareness of the role sharks play in marine ecosystems has resulted in changes in how they are perceived and utilized. Despite an ongoing harvest of sharks such as the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish (Squalus suckleyi), sharks now generate economic value through SCUBA diving enthusiasts who travel the globe to see, swim with, and photograph them. The use of digital cameras and other digital media has brought sharks into households around the world and increased awareness of the conservation issues facing many species. This renewed appreciation has led {{to a better understanding of}} sharks by the public, resulting in advocates calling for better protections and conservation. In particular, a growing part of the SCUBA diving community wants to contribute to conservation and research projects, which has led to participation in citizen science projects. These projects provide scientific data but also gain ground as ecotourism activities, thus adding to both economic value of tourism and conservation efforts...|$|R
