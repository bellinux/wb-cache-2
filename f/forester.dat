5|$|In 1608 Sir Hugh Pollard {{was named}} as chief <b>forester</b> {{in a suit}} brought before the Court of Exchequer by his deputy William Pincombe. James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde, was named as Keeper of Exmoor Forest in 1660 and 1661. James Boevey was a <b>forester</b> in the 17th century. Sir Richard Acland (or {{possibly}} Sir Thomas Dyke Acland) was the last <b>forester</b> up to 1818. One of {{the roles of the}} Warden was Master of Staghounds and this role continued to be exercised by the Master of the Devon and Somerset Staghounds, a position extant today. By 1820 the royal forest had been divided up. A quarter of the forest, , was sold to John Knight (1765–1850) in 1818. This section comprises the present Exmoor Parish, whose parish church is situated in Simonsbath.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the late}} 13th century Hundred Rolls, King Henry II of England (d. 1189) gave William of Wrotham the office of steward of Exmoor. The terms steward, warden and <b>forester</b> appear to be synonymous for the king's chief officer of the royal forest.|$|E
5|$|After King John's {{death in}} October 1216, Neville {{and his son}} made their peace with the new king, HenryIII, John's son. Both men had their lands {{restored}} in 1217, but the offices that the elder Neville had held were not returned quickly. Custody of some royal forests was returned by 1220, but the office of Chief <b>Forester</b> was not returned until some time later. In 1218 Neville {{was supposed to have}} had the forest of Rockingham returned to his custody, but William de Forz, the Count of Aumale, refused to return it. It was not until 1220 that de Neville managed to recover his custody of Rockingham forest. By 1224 Neville was once more Chief <b>Forester,</b> but he never regained the power and influence that he had held under John. When he lost the office for the second time is unclear. The historian C. R. Young states that he held the office until his death in 1234 when it passed to his son John, but Daniel Crook, writing in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, claims that Neville lost the <b>forester</b> office in 1229, to be replaced by John of Monmouth and Brian de Lisle. He also served as Sheriff of Lincolnshire.|$|E
50|$|<b>Foresters</b> {{work for}} the timber industry, {{government}} agencies, conservation groups, local authorities, urban parks boards, citizens' associations, and private landowners. The forestry profession includes a wide diversity of jobs, with educational requirements ranging from college bachelor's degrees to PhDs for highly specialized work. Industrial <b>foresters</b> plan forest regeneration starting with careful harvesting. Urban <b>foresters</b> manage trees in urban green spaces. <b>Foresters</b> work in tree nurseries growing seedlings for woodland creation or regeneration projects. <b>Foresters</b> improve tree genetics. Forest engineers develop new building systems.Professional <b>foresters</b> measure and model the growth of forests with tools like geographic information systems. <b>Foresters</b> may combat insect infestation, disease, forest and grassland wildfire, but increasingly allow these natural aspects of forest ecosystems to run their course when the likelihood of epidemics or risk of life or property are low. Increasingly, <b>foresters</b> participate in wildlife conservation planning and watershed protection. <b>Foresters</b> have been mainly concerned with timber management, especially reforestation, maintaining forests at prime conditions, and fire control.|$|R

When the TA was converted into the TAVR in 1967, 140 Regiment was disbanded and provided personnel to the Derbyshire (Territorial) Bn, Sherwood <b>Foresters.</b> In 1969 the battalion was reduced to cadre (later C (Derbyshire <b>Foresters)</b> Company in the Worcestershire and Sherwood <b>Foresters)</b> and 575 (The Sherwood <b>Foresters)</b> Fd Sqn was reformed in 73 Engineer Regiment.|$|R

5|$|<b>Forester</b> {{was built}} by J. Samuel White at its Cowes {{shipyard}} under the 1932 Naval Programme. The ship was laid down on 15 May 1933, launched on 28 June 1934, as the eleventh ship to carry the name, and completed on 19 April 1935. The ship cost 248,898 pounds, excluding Admiralty supplied equipment such as armaments and communications sets. <b>Forester</b> was initially assigned to the 6th Destroyer Flotilla (DF) of the Home Fleet, but was sent to reinforce the Mediterranean Fleet, together with most of her sister ships, during the Abyssinian crisis in June and remained here until February 1936. She was deployed to Gibraltar in September–October 1937 during the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939. The ship then returned home {{and spent the next}} two years with the 6th DF.

5|$|Beauchamp {{probably}} {{held the}} office of royal <b>forester</b> for Worcestershire as well as sheriff. The evidence {{for this is that}} after Beauchamp's death, his son William was granted the revenues from the royal forests of Worcestershire {{at the same rate as}} his father had held them; this strongly implies that the elder held {{the office of}} <b>forester.</b> The historian Judith Green felt that Walter de Beauchamp might possibly have held the office of constable, which had been held by his father-in-law, although the historian C. Warren Hollister felt that Beauchamp definitely did hold the office. He also a held the royal office of dispenser, an office which later became known as a butler. He acquired this because his wife inherited the office from her father. The date when he acquired the office is unknown. While a member of the royal household, Beauchamp witnessed a number of royal charters, mainly when the king was in England.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War Dahl was a {{pilot in}} the Royal Air Force (RAF) until he crashed in the Libyan desert; the {{subsequent}} injuries left him unfit to fly. He was posted to Washington as an assistant air attaché, ostensibly a diplomatic post, but which also included espionage and propaganda work. In 1942 the writer C.S. <b>Forester</b> asked him to provide details of his experiences in North Africa which <b>Forester</b> hoped to use {{in an article in}} The Saturday Evening Post. Instead of the notes which <b>Forester</b> expected, Dahl sent a finished story for which he was paid $900. The work led to The Gremlins, a serialised story in Cosmopolitan about a mischievous and fictional RAF creature, the gremlin; the work was published as Dahl's first novel in 1943. Dahl continued to write short stories, although these were all aimed at the adult market. They were sold to magazines and newspapers, and were later compiled into collections, the first of which was published in 1946. Dahl began to make up bedtime stories for the children, and these formed the basis of several of his stories. His first children's novel, James and the Giant Peach, was published in 1961, which was followed, along with others, by Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (1964), Fantastic Mr Fox (1970), Danny, the Champion of the World (1975), The BFG (1982) and Matilda in 1988.|$|E
5|$|HMS <b>Forester</b> {{was one of}} nine F-class destroyers {{built for}} the Royal Navy during the early 1930s.

A few weeks after the start of World War II in September 1939, she helped to sink one German submarine and then participated in the Second Battle of Narvik during the Norwegian Campaign of 1940. <b>Forester</b> was sent to Gibraltar in mid-1940 and formed part of Force H where she participated in the attack on the Vichy French ships at Mers-el-Kébir and the Battle of Dakar between escorting the aircraft carriers of Force H as they flew off aircraft for Malta and covering convoys resupplying and reinforcing the island until late 1941.

5|$|Neville {{was present}} at the Council of Clarendon, where he was among the king's followers. Neville was one of the {{witnesses}} to the Constitutions of Clarendon, which came out of the Council. In 1166 he was named chief <b>forester</b> of the royal forests, an office that was responsible for the royal officials in charge of administrating the forests as well as the system of royal courts that enforced the forest law. Neville headed the royal efforts to enforce the forest law, which banned cutting down timber, clearing new farm fields, poaching, or the creation of enclosures within the royal forest. Any offences against the forest law were subject to monetary fines, which were an important source of royal revenue. The royal forest included not only the forests owned by the king, but also many forests on lands held by other persons. After Neville's appointment as chief <b>forester,</b> {{he was in charge of}} hearing offences against the forest law and also imposing punishments. His activities were resented by the people subject to forest law.|$|E
