Finally in 1994, another source of its finance diminished as the administration of historical recreational venues ended when the city's municipality concluded not to renew the lease contract regarding the parks and pavilions in them. The club tried to overcome the financial difficulties by selling its properties one by one it owned from 1974 on.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} aims to {{find out}} the import goods settlement process through manually goods import notification (PIB) document, in electronic means through Electronic Data Interchange Network and the advantage of goods settlement through Electronic Data Exchange Network in madya (medium) type of Semarang Customs Supervising and Service Office. The research method employed was descriptive analysis, because it describes the condition of a research object studied and obtained through collecting completely the primary, secondary data and document taken from the research location. In addition, methods of collecting data employed were interview, library research, and observation. From the result of research, it can be found that the import goods settlement process through manually goods import notification (PIB) document in madya (medium) type of Semarang Customs Supervising and Service Office is regulated based on the Decree of Customs General Director Number: KEP- 68 /BC/ 2003. Meanwhile the import goods settlement process using Electronic Data Exchange Network is regulated based on the Decree of Customs General Director Number: P- 08 /BC/ 2009 the Amendment of Decree of Customs General Director Number: P- 08 /BC/ 2008 about the Instruction of the implementation of Imported Goods Release For Use. In addition, it can be seen the advantage of the import goods settlement process in electronic means through Electronic Data Interchange Network compared with that done manually. To smooth the imported goods withdrawal through a tight legally regulation consistent with Legislation, the presence of special training for importer in using the application of electronic data interchange, so that the goods importing will be more easy and well. The regulation of import goods settlement process through manually goods import notification (PIB) document can remain to be optimized. Keywords: <b>Import</b> <b>document,</b> PDE, and Manua...|$|E

40|$|This study {{outlines}} {{the role of}} trade facilitation in Pakistan for economic corridors in South Asia. We study {{the current state of}} trade related infrastructure in Pakistan and its connectedness particularly with Afghanistan and India. The implications of recently initiated Afghanistan – Pakistan transit trade agreement are discussed. Current impediments in expanding trade relations with India are revisited. A perception survey reveals the issues faced by importers and exporters particularly those dealing with Afghanistan and India. We also held detailed focus group discussions where government functionaries and commercial counselors also participated. The policy recommendations are grounded in existing literature and survey results. The report has highlighted the required improvements in infrastructure arrangements to facilitate trade for fostering cooperation in South Asia between Pakistan, Afghanistan and India. However, trade facilitation also requires harmonizing customs procedures and harmonizing the regulatory framework of other controlling authorities at the border crossings. Linkages need to be established among the customs organizations of the respective countries to exchange data so that export document of one country could serve as the <b>import</b> <b>document</b> of the other country. The phytosanitary and other quality standard of the countries need to be exchanged and harmonized to the extent possible to eliminate the technical barriers to trade. Finally the relations between India and Pakistan must be broad-based and allow guarantee towards non-reversal of a liberalized bilateral trading environment. Towards achieving this objective governments on both sides must be helped by the business community and civil society. Pakistan must also realize that while additional investment in trade infrastructure is necessary for sustaining economic growth, an equal emphasis is required to address issues that keep the existing infrastructure underutilized. In its overall infrastructure score, Pakistan is almost in line with its regional competitors, however it fares poorly when it comes to organizing and managing the already available assets. ...|$|E

This environment associates a videoconference tool (supporting verbal and non-verbal communication) and an original real-time shared digital hand-drawn sketches system (supporting graphical communication). The users can <b>import</b> <b>documents</b> and annotate them in real-time at distance. In this paper, {{we are interested in}} studying the use of the graphical modality (digital sketch and document annotations) as a tool for collective design and remote communication. This study takes place in the framework of a collaborative architectural design studio, which has taken place during 3 month, and gathering students from Belgium and France to work together in 3 small groups mainly at distance. The study focuses on the role of graphical modality in the synchronous remote meetings supported by the DCDS. We identify the types of digital annotations made on the <b>imported</b> <b>document,</b> thanks to the electronic pen, and their role in the cognitive processes of designing and in the collaboration and communication processes. We also identify the different practices of digital sketching, according to the group and its collaborative strategies. We discuss the utility of the graphical modality as an efficient support for collaborative synchronous activities and show that the DCDS environment supports different strategies of collaborative design (co-design and distributed design). We conclude on recommendations for improving the system and for designing sketch-based collaborative environments. Peer reviewe...|$|R
