Pickle, when he recover'd, went to the Opera Ball, here to his great surprise he met the P. who received him very kindly, and he still insisted upon foreign assistance, and the great assurances he had from England, and that he expected matters would go well in a very little time, he often mentioned foreign assistance by the Court of Berlin's influence, from Swedland.

[...] But whether thus these things, or whether not, [...] Whether the Sun predominant in Heav'n [...] 160 [...] Rise on the Earth, or Earth rise on the Sun, [...] Hee from the East his flaming rode begin, [...] Or Shee from West her silent course advance [...] With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps [...] On her soft Axle, while she paces Eev'n, [...] And bears thee soft with the smooth Air along, [...] Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid, [...] Leave them to God above, him serve and feare; [...] Of other Creatures, as him pleases best, [...] Wherever plac't, let him dispose: joy thou [...] 170 [...] In what he gives to thee, this Paradise [...] And thy faire Eve; Heav'n is for thee too high [...] To know what passes there; be lowlie wise: [...] Think onely what concernes thee and thy being; [...] Dream not of other Worlds, what Creatures there [...] Live, in what state, condition or degree, [...] Contented that thus farr hath been reveal'd [...] Not of Earth onely but of highest Heav'n. [...] To whom thus Adam cleerd of doubt, repli'd. [...] How fully hast thou satisfi'd mee, pure [...] 180 [...] Intelligence of Heav'n, Angel serene, [...] And freed from intricacies, taught to live, [...] The easiest way, nor with perplexing thoughts [...] To interrupt the sweet of Life, from which [...] God hath bid dwell farr off all anxious cares, [...] And not molest us, unless we our selves [...] Seek them with wandring thoughts, and notions vaine. [...] But apt the Mind or Fancie is to roave [...] Uncheckt, and of her roaving is no end; [...] Till warn'd, or by experience taught, she learne, [...] 190 [...] That not to know at large of things remote [...] From use, obscure and suttle, but to know [...] That which before us lies in daily life, [...] Is the prime Wisdom, what is more, is fume, [...] Or emptiness, or fond impertinence, [...] And renders us in things that most concerne [...] Unpractis'd, unprepar'd, and still to seek. [...] Therefore from this high pitch let us descend [...] A lower flight, and speak of things at hand [...] Useful, whence haply mention may arise [...] 200 [...] Of somthing not unseasonable to ask [...] By sufferance, and thy wonted favour deign'd. [...] Thee I have heard relating what was don [...] Ere my remembrance: now hear mee relate [...] My Storie, which perhaps thou hast not heard; [...] And Day is yet not spent; till then thou seest [...] How suttly to detaine thee I devise, [...] Inviting thee to hear while I relate, [...] Fond, were it not in hope of thy reply: [...] For while I sit with thee, I seem in Heav'n, [...] 210 [...] And sweeter thy discourse is to my eare [...] Then Fruits of Palm-tree pleasantest to thirst [...] And hunger both, from labour, at the houre [...] Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill, [...] Though pleasant, but thy words with Grace Divine [...] Imbu'd, bring to thir sweetness no satietie. [...] To whom thus Raphael answer'd heav'nly meek. [...] Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men, [...] Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee [...] Abundantly his gifts hath also pour'd, [...] 220 [...] Inward and outward both, his image faire: [...] Speaking or mute all comliness and grace [...] Attends thee, and each word, each motion formes. [...] Nor less think wee in Heav'n of thee on Earth [...] Then of our fellow servant, and inquire [...] Gladly into the wayes of God with Man: [...] For God we see hath honour'd thee, and set [...] On Man his equal Love: say therefore on; [...] For I that Day was absent, as befell, [...] Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure, [...] 230 [...] Farr on excursion toward the Gates of Hell; [...] Squar'd in full Legion (such command we had) [...] To see that none thence issu'd forth a spie, [...] Or enemie, while God was in his work, [...] Least hee incenst at such eruption bold, [...] Destruction with Creation might have mixt. [...] Not that they durst without his leave attempt, [...] But us he sends upon his high behests [...] For state, as Sovran King, and to enure [...] Our prompt obedience. Fast we found, fast shut [...] 240 [...] The dismal Gates, and barricado'd strong; [...] But long ere our approaching heard within [...] Noise, other then the sound of Dance or Song, [...] Torment, and lowd lament, and furious rage. [...] Glad we return'd up to the coasts of Light [...] Ere Sabbath Eev'ning: so we had in charge. [...] But thy relation now; for I attend, [...] Pleas'd with thy words no less then thou with mine. [...] So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire. [...] For Man to tell how human Life began [...] 250 [...] Is hard; for who himself beginning knew? [...] Desire with thee still longer to converse [...] Induc'd me. As new wak't from soundest sleep [...] Soft on the flourie herb I found me laid [...] In Balmie Sweat, which with his Beames the Sun [...] Soon dri'd, and on the reaking moisture fed. [...] Strait toward Heav'n my wondring Eyes I turnd, [...] And gaz'd a while the ample Skie, till rais'd [...] By quick instinctive motion up I sprung, [...] As thitherward endevoring, and upright [...] 260 [...] Stood on my feet; about me round I saw [...] Hill, Dale, and shadie Woods, and sunnie Plaines, [...] And liquid Lapse of murmuring Streams; by these, [...] Creatures that livd, and movd, and walk'd, or flew, [...] Birds on the branches warbling; all things smil'd, [...] With fragrance and with joy my heart oreflow'd. [...] My self I then perus'd, and Limb by Limb [...] Survey'd, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran [...] With supple joints, as lively vigour led: [...] But who I was, or where, or from what cause, [...] 270 [...] Knew not; to speak I tri'd, and forthwith spake, [...] My Tongue obey'd and readily could name [...] What e're I saw. Thou Sun, said I, faire Light, [...] And thou enlight'nd Earth, so fresh and gay, [...] Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plaines, [...] And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell, [...] Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here? [...] Not of my self; by some great Maker then, [...] In goodness and in power praeeminent; [...] Tell me, how may I know him, how adore, [...] 280 [...] From whom I have that thus I move and live, [...] And feel that I am happier then I know. [...] While thus I call'd, and stray'd I knew not whither, [...] From where I first drew Aire, and first beheld [...] This happie Light, when answer none return'd, [...] On a green shadie Bank profuse of Flours [...] Pensive I sate me down; there gentle sleep [...] First found me, and with soft oppression seis'd [...] My droused sense, untroubl'd, though I thought [...] I then was passing to my former state [...] 290 [...] Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve: [...] When suddenly stood at my Head a dream, [...] Whose inward apparition gently mov'd [...] My Fancy to believe I yet had being, [...] And livd: One came, methought, of shape Divine, [...] And said, thy Mansion wants thee, Adam, rise, [...] First Man, of Men innumerable ordain'd [...] First Father, call'd by thee I come thy Guide [...] To the Garden of bliss, thy seat prepar'd. [...] So saying, by the hand he took me rais'd, [...] 300 [...] And over Fields and Waters, as in Aire [...] Smooth sliding without step, last led me up [...] A woodie Mountain; whose high top was plaine, [...] A Circuit wide, enclos'd, with goodliest Trees [...] Planted, with Walks, and Bowers, that what I saw [...] Of Earth before scarse pleasant seemd. Each Tree [...] Load'n with fairest Fruit, that hung to the Eye [...] Tempting, stirr'd in me sudden appetite [...] To pluck and eate; whereat I wak'd, and found [...] Before mine Eyes all real, as the dream [...] 310 [...] Had lively shadowd: Here had new begun [...] My wandring, had not hee who was my Guide [...] Up hither, from among the Trees appeer'd, [...] Presence Divine. Rejoycing, but with aw [...] In adoration at his feet I fell [...] Submiss: he rear'd me, & Whom thou soughtst I am, [...] Said mildely, Author of all this thou seest [...] Above, or round about thee or beneath. [...] This Paradise I give thee, count it thine [...] To Till and keep, and of the Fruit to eate: [...] 320 [...] Of every Tree that in the Garden growes [...] Eate freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth: [...] But of the Tree whose operation brings [...] Knowledg of good and ill, which I have set [...] The Pledge of thy Obedience and thy Faith, [...] Amid the Garden by the Tree of Life, [...] Remember what I warne thee, shun to taste, [...] And shun the bitter consequence: for know, [...] The day thou eat'st thereof, my sole command [...] Transgrest, inevitably thou shalt dye; [...] 330 [...] From that day mortal, and this happie State [...] Shalt loose, expell'd from hence into a World [...] Of woe and sorrow. Sternly he pronounc'd [...] The rigid interdiction, which resounds [...] Yet dreadful in mine eare, though in my choice [...] Not to incur; but soon his cleer aspect [...] Return'd and gratious purpose thus renew'd. [...] Not onely these fair bounds, but all the Earth [...] To thee and to thy Race I give; as Lords [...] Possess it, and all things that therein live, [...] 340 [...] Or live in Sea, or Aire, Beast, Fish, and Fowle. [...] In signe whereof each Bird and Beast behold [...] After thir kindes; I bring them to receave [...] From thee thir Names, and pay thee fealtie [...] With low subjection; understand the same [...] Of Fish within thir watry residence, [...] Not hither summond, since they cannot change [...] Thir Element to draw the thinner Aire. [...] As thus he spake, each Bird and Beast behold [...] Approaching two and two, These cowring low [...] 350 [...] With blandishment, each Bird stoop'd on his wing. [...] I nam'd them, as they pass'd, and understood [...] Thir Nature, with such knowledg God endu'd [...] My sudden apprehension: but in these [...] I found not what me thought I wanted still; [...] And to the Heav'nly vision thus presum'd. [...] O by what Name, for thou above all these, [...] Above mankinde, or aught then mankinde higher, [...] Surpassest farr my naming, how may I [...] Adore thee, Author of this Universe, [...] 360 [...] And all this good to man, for whose well being [...] So amply, and with hands so liberal [...] Thou hast provided all things: but with mee [...] I see not who partakes. In solitude [...] What happiness, who can enjoy alone, [...] Or all enjoying, what contentment find? [...] Thus I presumptuous; and the vision bright, [...] As with a smile more bright'nd, thus repli'd. [...] What call'st thou solitude, is not the Earth [...] With various living creatures, and the Aire [...] 370 [...] Replenisht, and all these at thy command [...] To come and play before thee, know'st thou not [...] Thir language and thir wayes, they also know, [...] And reason not contemptibly; with these [...] Find pastime, and beare rule; thy Realm is large. [...] So spake the Universal Lord, and seem'd [...] So ordering. I with leave of speech implor'd, [...] And humble deprecation thus repli'd. [...] Let not my words offend thee, Heav'nly Power, [...] My Maker, be propitious while I speak. [...] 380 [...] Hast thou not made me here thy substitute, [...] And these inferiour farr beneath me set? [...] Among unequals what societie [...] Can sort, what harmonie or true delight? [...] Which must be mutual, in proportion due [...] Giv'n and receiv'd; but in disparitie [...] The one intense, the other still remiss [...] Cannot well suite with either, but soon prove [...] Tedious alike: Of fellowship I speak [...] Such as I seek, fit to participate [...] 390 [...] All rational delight, wherein the brute [...] Cannot be human consort; they rejoyce [...] Each with thir kinde, Lion with Lioness; [...] So fitly them in pairs thou hast combin'd; [...] Much less can Bird with Beast, or Fish with Fowle [...] So well converse, nor with the Ox the Ape; [...] Wors then can Man with Beast, and least of all. [...] Whereto th' Almighty answer'd, not displeas'd. [...] A nice and suttle happiness I see [...] Thou to thy self proposest, in the choice [...] 400 [...] Of thy Associates, Adam, and wilt taste [...] No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitarie. [...] What thinkst thou then of mee, and this my State, [...] Seem I to thee sufficiently possest [...] Of happiness, or not? who am alone [...] From all Eternitie, for none I know [...] Second to mee or like, equal much less. [...] How have I then with whom to hold converse [...] Save with the Creatures which I made, and those [...] To me inferiour, infinite descents [...] 410 [...] Beneath what other Creatures are to thee? [...] He ceas'd, I lowly answer'd. To attaine [...] The highth and depth of thy Eternal wayes [...] All human thoughts come short, Supream of things; [...] Thou in thy self art perfet, and in thee [...] Is no deficience found; not so is Man, [...] But in degree, the cause of his desire [...] By conversation with his like to help, [...] Or solace his defects. No need that thou [...] Shouldst propagat, already infinite; [...] 420 [...] And through all numbers absolute, though One; [...] But Man by number is to manifest [...] His single imperfection, and beget [...] Like of his like, his Image multipli'd, [...] In unitie defective, which requires [...] Collateral love, and deerest amitie. [...] Thou in thy secresie although alone, [...] Best with thy self accompanied, seek'st not [...] Social communication, yet so pleas'd, [...] Canst raise thy Creature to what highth thou wilt [...] 430 [...] Of Union or Communion, deifi'd; [...] I by conversing cannot these erect [...] From prone, nor in thir wayes complacence find. [...] Thus I embold'nd spake, and freedom us'd [...] Permissive, and acceptance found, which gain'd [...] This answer from the gratious voice Divine. [...] Thus farr to try thee, Adam, I was pleas'd, [...] And finde thee knowing not of Beasts alone, [...] Which thou hast rightly nam'd, but of thy self, [...] Expressing well the spirit within thee free, [...] 440 [...] My Image, not imparted to the Brute, [...] Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee [...] Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike, [...] And be so minded still; I, ere thou spak'st, [...] Knew it not good for Man to be alone, [...] And no such companie as then thou saw'st [...] Intended thee, for trial onely brought, [...] To see how thou could'st judge of fit and meet: [...] What next I bring shall please thee, be assur'd, [...] Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self, [...] 450 [...] Thy wish, exactly to thy hearts desire. [...] Hee ended, or I heard no more, for now [...] My earthly by his Heav'nly overpowerd, [...] Which it had long stood under, streind to the highth [...] In that celestial Colloquie sublime, [...] As with an object that excels the sense, [...] Dazl'd and spent, sunk down, and sought repair [...] Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, call'd [...] By Nature as in aide, and clos'd mine eyes. [...] Mine eyes he clos'd, but op'n left the Cell [...] 460 [...] Of Fancie my internal sight, by which [...] Abstract as in a transe methought I saw, [...] Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape [...] Still glorious before whom awake I stood; [...] Who stooping op'nd my left side, and took [...] From thence a Rib, with cordial spirits warme, [...] And Life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound, [...] But suddenly with flesh fill'd up & heal'd: [...] The Rib he formd and fashond with his hands; [...] Under his forming hands a Creature grew, [...] 470 [...] Manlike, but different sex, so lovly faire, [...] That what seemd fair in all the World, seemd now [...] Mean, or in her summd up, in her containd [...] And in her looks, which from that time infus'd [...] Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before, [...] And into all things from her Aire inspir'd [...] The spirit of love and amorous delight. [...] She disappeerd, and left me dark, I wak'd [...] To find her, or for ever to deplore [...] Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure: [...] 480 [...] When out of hope, behold her, not farr off, [...] Such as I saw her in my dream, adornd [...] With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow [...] To make her amiable: On she came, [...] Led by her Heav'nly Maker, though unseen, [...] And guided by his voice, nor uninformd [...] Of nuptial Sanctitie and marriage Rites: [...] Grace was in all her steps, Heav'n in her Eye, [...] In every gesture dignitie and love. [...] I overjoyd could not forbear aloud. [...] 490 [...] This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfill'd [...] Thy words, Creator bounteous and benigne, [...] Giver of all things faire, but fairest this [...] Of all thy gifts, nor enviest. I now see [...] Bone of my Bone, Flesh of my Flesh, my Self [...] Before me; Woman is her Name, of Man [...] Extracted; for this cause he shall forgoe [...] Father and Mother, and to his Wife adhere; [...] And they shall be one Flesh, one Heart, one Soule. [...] She heard me thus, and though divinely brought, [...] 500 [...] Yet Innocence and Virgin Modestie, [...] Her vertue and the conscience of her worth, [...] That would be woo'd, and not unsought be won, [...] Not obvious, not obtrusive, but retir'd, [...] The more desirable, or to say all, [...] Nature her self, though pure of sinful thought, [...] Wrought in her so, that seeing me, she turn'd; [...] I follow'd her, she what was Honour knew, [...] And with obsequious Majestie approv'd [...] My pleaded reason. To the Nuptial Bowre [...] 510 [...] I led her blushing like the Morn: all Heav'n, [...] And happie Constellations on that houre [...] Shed thir selectest influence; the Earth [...] Gave sign of gratulation, and each Hill; [...] Joyous the Birds; fresh Gales and gentle Aires [...] Whisper'd it to the Woods, and from thir wings [...] Flung Rose, flung Odours from the spicie Shrub, [...] Disporting, till the amorous Bird of Night [...] Sung Spousal, and bid haste the Eevning Starr [...] On his Hill top, to light the bridal Lamp. [...] 520 [...] Thus I have told thee all my State, and brought [...] My Storie to the sum of earthly bliss [...] Which I enjoy, and must confess to find [...] In all things else delight indeed, but such [...] As us'd or not, works in the mind no change, [...] Nor vehement desire, these delicacies [...] I mean of Taste, Sight, Smell, Herbs, Fruits, & Flours, [...] Walks, and the melodie of Birds; but here [...] Farr otherwise, transported I behold, [...] Transported touch; here passion first I felt, [...] 530 [...] Commotion strange, in all enjoyments else [...] Superiour and unmov'd, here onely weake [...] Against the charm of Beauties powerful glance. [...] Or Nature faild in mee, and left some part [...] Not proof enough such Object to sustain, [...] Or from my side subducting, took perhaps [...] More then enough; at least on her bestow'd [...] Too much of Ornament, in outward shew [...] Elaborate, of inward less exact. [...] For well I understand in the prime end [...] 540 [...] Of Nature her th' inferiour, in the mind [...] And inward Faculties, which most excell, [...] In outward also her resembling less [...] His Image who made both, and less expressing [...] The character of that Dominion giv'n [...] O're other Creatures; yet when I approach [...] Her loveliness, so absolute she seems [...] And in her self compleat, so well to know [...] Her own, that what she wills to do or say, [...] Seems wisest, vertuousest, discreetest, best; [...] 550 [...] All higher knowledge in her presence falls [...] Degraded, Wisdom in discourse with her [...] Looses discount'nanc't, and like folly shewes; [...] Authoritie and Reason on her waite, [...] As one intended first, not after made [...] Occasionally; and to consummate all, [...] Greatness of mind and nobleness thir seat [...] Build in her loveliest, and create an awe [...] About her, as a guard Angelic plac't. [...] To whom the Angel with contracted brow. [...] 560 [...] Accuse not Nature, she hath don her part; [...] Do thou but thine, and be not diffident [...] Of Wisdom, she deserts thee not, if thou [...] Dismiss not her, when most thou needst her nigh, [...] By attributing overmuch to things [...] Less excellent, as thou thy self perceav'st. [...] For what admir'st thou, what transports thee so, [...] An outside? fair no doubt, and worthy well [...] Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love, [...] Not thy subjection: weigh with her thy self; [...] 570 [...] Then value: Oft times nothing profits more [...] Then self-esteem, grounded on just and right [...] Well manag'd; of that skill the more thou know'st, [...] The more she will acknowledge thee her Head, [...] And to realities yeild all her shows; [...] Made so adorn for thy delight the more, [...] So awful, that with honour thou maist love [...] Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise. [...] But if the sense of touch whereby mankind [...] Is propagated seem such dear delight [...] 580 [...] Beyond all other, think the same voutsaf't [...] To Cattel and each Beast; which would not be [...] To them made common & divulg'd, if aught [...] Therein enjoy'd were worthy to subdue [...] The Soule of Man, or passion in him move. [...] What higher in her societie thou findst [...] Attractive, human, rational, love still; [...] In loving thou dost well, in passion not, [...] Wherein true Love consists not; love refines [...] The thoughts, and heart enlarges, hath his seat [...] 590 [...] In Reason, and is judicious, is the scale [...] By which to heav'nly Love thou maist ascend, [...] Not sunk in carnal pleasure, for which cause [...] Among the Beasts no Mate for thee was found. [...] To whom thus half abash't Adam repli'd. [...] Neither her out-side formd so fair, nor aught [...] In procreation common to all kindes [...] (Though higher of the genial Bed by far, [...] And with mysterious reverence I deem) [...] So much delights me, as those graceful acts, [...] 600 [...] Those thousand decencies that daily flow [...] From all her words and actions, mixt with Love [...] And sweet compliance, which declare unfeign'd [...] Union of Mind, or in us both one Soule; [...] Harmonie to behold in wedded pair [...] More grateful then harmonious sound to the eare. [...] Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose [...] What inward thence I feel, not therefore foild, [...] Who meet with various objects, from the sense [...] Variously representing; yet still free [...] 610 [...] Approve the best, and follow what I approve. [...] To love thou blam'st me not, for love thou saist [...] Leads up to Heav'n, is both the way and guide; [...] Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask; [...] Love not the heav'nly Spirits, and how thir Love [...] Express they, by looks onely, or do they mix [...] Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch? [...] To whom the Angel with a smile that glow'd [...] Celestial rosie red, Loves proper hue, [...] Answer'd. Let it suffice thee that thou know'st [...] 620 [...] Us happie, and without Love no happiness. [...] Whatever pure thou in the body enjoy'st [...] (And pure thou wert created) we enjoy [...] In eminence, and obstacle find none [...] Of membrane, joynt, or limb, exclusive barrs: [...] Easier then Air with Air, if Spirits embrace, [...] Total they mix, Union of Pure with Pure [...] Desiring; nor restrain'd conveyance need [...] As Flesh to mix with Flesh, or Soul with Soul. [...] But I can now no more; the parting Sun [...] 630 [...] Beyond the Earths green Cape and verdant Isles [...] Hesperean sets, my Signal to depart. [...] Be strong, live happie, and love, but first of all [...] Him whom to love is to obey, and keep [...] His great command; take heed least Passion sway [...] Thy Judgement to do aught, which else free Will [...] Would not admit; thine and of all thy Sons [...] The weal or woe in thee is plac't; beware. [...] I in thy persevering shall rejoyce, [...] And all the Blest: stand fast; to stand or fall [...] 640 [...] Free in thine own Arbitrement it lies. [...] Perfet within, no outward aid require; [...] And all temptation to transgress repel. [...] So saying, he arose; whom Adam thus [...] Follow'd with benediction. Since to part, [...] Go heavenly Guest, Ethereal Messenger, [...] Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore. [...] Gentle to me and affable hath been [...] Thy condescension, and shall be honour'd ever [...] With grateful Memorie: thou to mankind [...] 650 [...] Be good and friendly still, and oft return. [...] So parted they, the Angel up to Heav'n [...] From the thick shade, and Adam to his Bowre.|$|E
