5|$|Unlike most of Fagen's {{previous}} work, The Nightfly {{is almost}} blatantly autobiographical. Many {{of the songs}} relate to the cautiously optimistic mood of his suburban childhood in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and incorporate such topics as late-night jazz disc jockeys, fallout shelters, and tropical vacations. Recorded over eight months at various studios between New York City and Los Angeles, the album is an early example of a fully <b>digital</b> <b>recording</b> in popular music. The nascent technology, {{as well as the}} perfectionist nature of its engineers and musicians, made the album difficult to record.|$|E
5|$|Like a Virgin is {{the second}} studio album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Madonna, released on November 12, 1984, by Sire Records. Following the success of her self-titled debut album, Madonna wanted to become the record producer of her next album. However, her label {{was not ready to}} give her the artistic freedom and she chose Nile Rodgers instead to produce the album due to his work with David Bowie. Madonna wrote six songs on the record, five of which feature Steve Bray as a co-writer. The album was recorded at Power Station Studio in New York at a quick pace. Rodgers enlisted the help of his former Chic bandmates Bernard Edwards, who was the bassist, and Tony Thompson, who played drums. Jason Corsaro, the record's audio engineer, persuaded Rodgers to use <b>digital</b> <b>recording,</b> a new technique introduced at that time.|$|E
5|$|Wasting Light is {{the seventh}} studio album by American rock band Foo Fighters. It was {{released}} on April 12, 2011 on RCA Records, and is the first album to feature rhythm guitarist Pat Smear since The Colour and the Shape (1997), making the band a five piece with the album. Wishing to {{capture the essence of}} the group's earlier work and avoid the artificiality of <b>digital</b> <b>recording,</b> frontman Dave Grohl arranged for the band to record in his garage in Encino, California using only analog equipment. The sessions were supervised by producer Butch Vig, with whom Grohl had worked on Nirvana's Nevermind. Since the old equipment did not allow for many mistakes to be corrected in post-production, the band spent three weeks rehearsing the songs, and Vig had to relearn outdated editing techniques. The band went for a heavier and rawer sound to contrast with the musical experiments from their previous albums, and most of the lyrics were written as Grohl reflected upon his life and possible future. Guest musicians include Bob Mould, Krist Novoselic, Jessy Greene, Rami Jaffe and Fee Waybill.|$|E
40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2014. Includes bibliographical references. At the Hawaii State Archives, {{there is}} a need to update their <b>digital</b> <b>records</b> {{preservation}} capabilities. Thus, they are currently in the process of implementing a records system which has been designed to store, protect, and preserve <b>digital</b> <b>records.</b> The types of <b>digital</b> <b>records</b> include medical records, annual reports, birth records, etc. This records system requires a <b>Digital</b> <b>Records</b> Transfer tool which must provide government agencies of Hawaii with the ability to transfer <b>digital</b> <b>records</b> to the Hawaii State Archives. Its transfer process must use secure and authenticated methods that document and ensure that the entirety of the files have been transferred uncorrupted.

40|$|Simon Fraser University (Vancouver, Canada) marked its 50 th anniversary by {{launching}} a digital repository to permanently preserve the university’s <b>digital</b> <b>records</b> of archival value. Simultaneously, the records management program launched a digital readiness project to educate departments {{about how to}} create <b>digital</b> <b>records</b> that will {{stand the test of}} time. This case study focuses on the training component of the project and details how the university is addressing knowledge gaps among <b>records</b> creators around <b>digital</b> <b>records</b> issues by creating training materials that are openly licensed and may be freely reused. Open educational resources or “OERs” are part of a wider open access movement in education. OERs can be created to address <b>digital</b> <b>records</b> issues and then shared with other institutions that are facing similar challenges in training their users on how to create and maintain good <b>digital</b> <b>records.</b>   This article explains the efforts of one university to prepare records creators for a future of <b>digital</b> <b>records</b> preservation...|$|R

Development of a dynamic health care <b>digital</b> <b>record</b> will be invaluable for the integration of health care systems to optimize patient care.|$|R
5|$|The {{late 1990s}} saw an {{increase}} in the free trading of digital bootlegs, sharply decreasing the demand for and profitability of physical bootlegs. The rise of audio file formats such as MP3 and Real Audio, combined with the ability to share files between computers via the internet made it simpler for bootleg collectors to exchange recordings. The arrival of Napster in 1999 made it easy to share bootlegs between a large computer network. Older analog recordings were converted to digital format, tracks from bootleg CDs were ripped to computer hard disks, and new material was created with <b>digital</b> <b>recording</b> of various types, and all of these types could now be easily shared. Instead of album-length collections or live recordings of entire shows, fans often now had the option of searching for and downloading bootlegs of individual songs. Artists gave a mixed reaction to bootleg sharing via the internet; Bob Dylan allowed fans to download archive recordings from his official website, while King Crimson's Robert Fripp and, infamously, Metallica were strongly critical of the ease in which Napster could circumvent the traditional channels of royalty payments.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the development of ‘digital records’ to support ethnographic study of interaction and collaboration in ubiquitous computing environments and articulate the core concept of ‘record and replay’ through two case studies. One focuses on the utility of <b>digital</b> <b>records,</b> or records of interaction generated by a computer system, to ethnographic inquiry and highlights the mutually supportive nature of <b>digital</b> <b>records</b> and ethnographic methods. The other focuses on the work {{it takes to make}} <b>digital</b> <b>records</b> support ethnography, particularly the work of description and representation that is required to reconcile the fragmented character of interaction in ubiquitous computing environments. The work involved in ‘making <b>digital</b> <b>records</b> work’ highlights requirements for the design of tools to support the endeavour and informs the development of a Replay Tool. This tool enables ethnographers to visualize the data content of digital records; to extract sequences of relevance to analysis and remove non-relevant features; to marry recorded content with external resources, such as video; to add content from internal and external resources through annotation; and to reorder <b>digital</b> <b>records</b> to reflect the interactional order of events rather than the recorded order of events...|$|R

25|$|As video {{recorder}} technology improved it became possible to modify them and use analogue to digital converters (codecs) for digital sound recording. This brought greater dynamic range to tape mastering, combined with low noise and distortion, {{and freedom from}} drop outs as well as pre- and post-echo.

25|$|As an {{alternative}} to playback with a stylus, a recording can be read optically, processed with software that calculates the velocity that the stylus would be moving in the mapped grooves and converted to a <b>digital</b> <b>recording</b> format.
