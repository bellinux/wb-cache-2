40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} {{stochastic}} resonance (SR) {{in a single}} <b>electron</b> <b>turnstile.</b> It has been known that SR emerges by the cooperation of a weak periodic signal and noise in a bistable system. A periodic signal produces switching between two stable states by lowering the potential barrier. Even if the amplitude of the signal is not large {{enough to make the}} potential barrier disappear, the switching can occur with the help of noise. As a result, an output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which shows how much the switching is synchronized with the signal, can be enhanced by increasing the noise. We have formulated the SR in a single <b>electron</b> <b>turnstile</b> into the adiabatic two-state theory of McNamara-Wiesenfeld and confirmed its manifestation by numerical simulation. These results could be applied to detection of the periodic motion of very small electric charge under noisy environment. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures, pdflate...|$|E

We used two single-electron transistors (SETs) to simultaneously read out {{different parts of}} the box, enabling us to map out stability diagrams of the box and identify various charge transfer processes in the box. We further characterized the elastic cotunneling in the box, which is an important source of error in <b>electron</b> <b>turnstiles</b> consisting of hybrid SETs, and found that the rate was as low as 1 Hz at degeneracy and compatible with theoretical estimates for electron tunneling via virtual states in the central superconducting island of the box...|$|R
40|$|We {{review the}} status of the {{understanding}} of single-electron transport (SET) devices with respect to their applicability in metrology. Their envisioned role as the basis of a high-precision electrical standard is outlined and is discussed in the context of other standards. The operation principles of single <b>electron</b> transistors, <b>turnstiles</b> and pumps are explained and the fundamental limits of these devices are discussed in detail. We describe the various physical mechanisms that influence the device uncertainty and review the analytical and numerical methods needed to calculate the intrinsic uncertainty and to optimise the fabrication and operation parameters. Recent experimental results are evaluated and compared with theoretical predictions. Although there are discrepancies between theory and experiments, the intrinsic uncertainty is already small enough to start preparing for the first SET-based metrological applications.

40|$|Phase-tunable hybrid devices, {{built upon}} {{nanostructures}} combining normal metal and superconductors, {{have been the}} subject of intense studies due to their numerous combinations of different charge and heat transport configurations. They exhibit solid applications in quantum metrology and coherent caloritronics. Here we propose a new kind of hybrid device that can be used as a novel source of quantized current. We show that alternatively tuning superconductivity on two proximized nanowires, coupled via a Coulombic normal metal island, will result in a turnstile configuration for single <b>electrons.</b> This <b>turnstile</b> supports a one-control-parameter-cycle being actuated by the sole magnetic flux. In a voltage biased regime, the phase-tunable superconducting gaps can act as energy barriers for charge quanta leading to an additional degree of freedom in single electronics. The resulting configuration is fully electrostatic and the current across the device is governed by the quasiparticle populations in the source and drain leads. Notably, the proposed device can be realized using standard nanotechniques opening the possibility to a straightfowrward coupling with the nowadays well developed supercondicting electronics.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel HSPICE circuit model for designing and simulating a Single-Electron (SE) turnstile, as applicable at the nanometric feature sizes. The proposed SE model {{consists of two}} nearly similar parts whose operation is independent of each other; this disjoint feature permits the accurate and reliable modeling of the sequential transfer of <b>electrons</b> through the <b>turnstile</b> in the storage node (modeled on a voltage level basis). It therefore avoids the transient (current-based) nature of a previous model, thus ensuring robustness in simulated operation. The model has been simulated and results show that it can robustly operate at 32 and 45 nm with excellent stability in its operation. Extensive simulation results are presented to substantiate the advantages of using the proposed model with respect {{to changes in the}} circuit model parameters as related to capacitances, feature size and voltages...|$|R
40|$|This work {{addresses}} the dynamical quantum {{problem of a}} driven discrete energy level coupled to a semi-infinite continuum whose density of states has a square-root-type singularity, such as states of a free particle in one dimension or quasiparticle states in a BCS superconductor. The system dynamics is strongly affected by the quantum-mechanical repulsion between the discrete level and the singularity, which {{gives rise to a}} bound state, suppresses the decay into the continuum, and can produce Stueckelberg oscillations. This quantum coherence effect may limit the performance of mesoscopic superconducting devices, such as quantum <b>electron</b> <b>turnstile.</b> Comment: accepted version; 10 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the static, charge-trapping properties of a hybrid superconductor [...] -normal metal <b>electron</b> <b>turnstile</b> embedded into a high-ohmic environment. The device includes a local Cr resistor {{on one side of}} the turnstile, and a superconducting trapping island on the other side. The electron hold times, t ~ 2 - 20 s, in our two-junction circuit are comparable with those of typical multi-junction, N >= 4, normal-metal single-electron tunneling devices.

40|$|We {{investigate}} theoretically {{a scheme}} for spectroscopy of electrons emitted by an on-demand single particle source. The total system, with an <b>electron</b> <b>turnstile</b> source {{and a single}} level quantum dot spectrometer, is implemented with edge states in a conductor in the quantum Hall regime. Employing a Floquet scattering approach, the source and the spectrometer are analyzed within a single theoretical framework. The non-equilibrium distribution of the emitted electrons is analyzed via the direct current at the dot spectrometer. In the adiabatic and intermediate source frequency regimes, the distribution {{is found to be}} strongly peaked around the active resonant level of the turnstile. At high frequencies the distribution is split up into a set of fringes, resulting from the interplay of resonant transport through the turnstile and absorption or emission of individual Floquet quanta. For ideal source operation, with exactly one electron emitted per cycle, an expression for the single electron wavefunction is derived. Comment: 12 pages, 7 figure...|$|E
40|$|Electrons {{floating}} {{on the surface of}} superfluid helium have been suggested as promising mobile spin quantum bits (qubits). Transferring electrons extremely efficiently in a narrow channel structure with underlying gates has been demonstrated, showing no transfer error while clocking 10 ^ 9 pixels in a 3 -phase charge coupled device (CCD). While on average, one electron per channel was clocked, it is desirable to reliably obtain a single electron per channel. We have designed an <b>electron</b> <b>turnstile</b> consisting of a narrow (0. 8 μm) channel and narrow underlying gates (0. 5 μm) operating across seventy-eight parallel channels. Initially, we find that more than one electron can be held above the small gates. Underlying gates in the turnstile region allow us to repeatedly split these electron packets. Results show a plateau in the electron signal {{as a function of the}} applied gate voltages, indicating quantization of the number of electrons per pixel, simultaneously across the seventy-eight parallel channels...|$|E
40|$|Electron spins in {{semiconductor}} {{quantum dots}} (QDs) have been increasingly shown {{in recent years}} to be a promising platform for realising the qubit – the basic unit of information in quantum computing. A crucial advantage of silicon QDs over alternative platforms is the potential for scalability in a quantum system to contain large numbers of qubits. Electron spins in Si-based QDs also have the benefit of a much longer spin coherence time relative to their extensively researched GaAs based counter parts – a prerequisite which gives the essential time needed for successful quantum gate operations and quantum computations. In this work, we propose and realise the first very large scale integration (VLSI) compatible process capable of fabricating scalable repeatable QD systems in parallel using silicon on insulator (SOI) technology. 3 D finite element method (FEM) capacitance and single electron circuit simulations are first utilised to demonstrate the suitability of our double quantum dot (DQD) design dimensions in supporting single electron operation and detection. Here, we also present a new method of detection for single <b>electron</b> <b>turnstile</b> operations which makes use of the periodicity present in the charge stability diagram of a DQD. Through process optimisation, we fabricate 144 high density lithographically defined Si DQDs {{for the first time in}} parallel with 80 % of the fabricated devices having dimensional variations of less than 5 nm. The novel use of hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) resist with electron beam lithography (EBL) enabled the realisation of lithographically defined reproducible QD dimensions of an average of 51 nm with a standard deviation of 3. 4 nm. Combined with an optimised thermal oxidation process, we demonstrate the precise fabrication of different QDs ranging from just 10. 6 nm to over 20 nm. These are the smallest lithographically defined high density intrinsic SOI based QDs achieved to date. In addition, we demonstrate the flexibility of our fabrication process in its ability to realise a wide variety of complex device designs repeatedly. A key advantage of our process is its ability to support the scalable fabrication of QD devices without significantly affecting fabrication turnover time. Repeatable characteristic QD Coulomb oscillations and Coulomb diamonds signifying single electron tunnelling through our system are observed in electrical characteristics. Here we achieve precise independent simultaneous control of different QD’s single electron occupation as well as demonstrate evidence suggesting charge detection between QD channels. The unmatched level of clarity observed within Coulomb blockade diamond characteristics at 4. 2 K enables observations of line splitting of our QD’s excited states at this temperature, and readout of the spin orientation of sequential single electrons filling the QD. Through this spin readout, we gained an idea of the number of electrons stored on the QD and in turn, our ability to control the QD with precision down to the single electron limit. Statistically, we realise a parallel fabrication yield of 69 % of devices demonstrating the ability to switch on and off repeatedly at 4 K cryogenic temperatures with no leakage and sufficient channel resistances for single <b>electron</b> <b>turnstile</b> operations. This is the highest achieved yield observed to date for fabrication of intrinsic SOI based QD systems...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{covers a}} range of {{experiments}} on single-electron devices, electrical circuits that utilize the discreetness of the electron charge. The Single-Electron Transistor (SET) is of special importance among these, being the most sensitive electrometer demonstrated, and sufficiently mature {{to serve as a}} building block in sensors and detectors for physical phenomena that can be transformed into charge signals. Such an example is the use of the SET as a local probe for Surface Acoustic Waves (SAW), demonstrated here for the first time. The SAW is a mechanical wave propagating on the surface of a solid, in this case a GaAs substrate. Due to the piezoelectricity of GaAs, the SAW is accompanied by a wave of electrical polarization which couples efficiently to an SET deposited on the same substrate. The experiments demonstrate a sensitivity to surface displacement of 30 am/√Hz, which is 2 – 3 orders of magnitude better than in previous SAW experiments. The SET is located between two on-chip acoustic reflectors separated by 2. 9 mm, and has a sufficient measurement bandwidth to resolve the echoes of acoustic pulses between the reflectors. The resolution when averaging over many pulses is sufficient to resolve an average energy of h f per pulse reaching the SET. These experiments, along with associated theoretical treatments, indicate that studies on propagating acoustic waves in the quantum mechanical regime are feasible. The high charge sensitivity of the SET was also applied in prototypes for detection of single optical photons, where photo-generated electron-hole pairs near the surface of a semiconductor heterostructure are separated and transported to within the detection range of SETs deposited on the same chip. Another part of the thesis concerns the characterization of charge noise, which limits performance in SETs and related devices such as qubits and electron pumps. The dependence of the noise level on temperature and SET bias conditions is investigated, as well as its connection to the long-term relaxation observed after sudden application of a strong electric field. The results show that the sources of charge noise are in thermal equilibrium also at comparatively low temperature, and are in strong thermal contact with the electrons residing in the SET. This gives an indication about the microscopic nature and possible locations of the noise sources. The final part of the thesis is devoted to the study of quantized current sources, devices which can transport electrons one by one through a circuit at a controlled rate. To be com- parable with other metrological standards, such a current source must be accurate to around one part in 10 ^ 8, which requires careful study and elimination of all possible error sources. Errors due to Photon-Assisted Tunneling were studied in a resistively terminated multi-junction pump, and errors due to Andreev tunneling were demonstrated in a hybrid SINIS <b>electron</b> <b>turnstile.</b> The latter experiment shows that errors due to Andreev tunneling is reduced sub- stantially in turnstiles with high charging energy...|$|E
