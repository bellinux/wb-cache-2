5|$|<b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> {{state that}} my book, Vier Jahre unter Kannibalen, {{contains}} {{a number of}} misrepresentations regarding my journeys in New Guinea. The book in question is a scientific report in part only; it is primarily a fictional account of my experiences in New Guinea and owes its origin to the unusual circumstances prevailing in Germany {{at the time of}} my return. Some of the journeys I had actually undertaken are not described at all; on the other hand it contains passages that do not correspond with the facts.|$|E
5|$|Let {{it not be}} concluded, that <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> invert {{the order}} of things; I have already granted, that, from the {{constitution}} of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain {{a greater degree of}} virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequentially, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God.|$|E
5|$|My dearest Hogg my baby is dead—will {{you come}} to see me as soon as you can. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> see you—It was {{perfectly}} well when I went to bed—I awoke in the night to give it suck it appeared to be sleeping so quietly that I would not awake it. It was dead then, but we did not find that out till morning—from its appearance it evidently died of convulsions—Will you come—you are so calm a creature & Shelley is afraid of a fever from the milk—for I am no longer a mother now.|$|E
60|$|For my own part, {{slipping}} {{along this}} moving thoroughfare in my fiddle-case of a canoe, I also {{was beginning to}} grow aweary for my ocean. To the civilised man, there must come, sooner or later, a desire for civilisation. I was weary of dipping the paddle; I was weary of living on the skirts of life; <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> be {{in the thick of}} it once more; <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> get <b>to</b> work; <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> meet people who understood my own speech, and could meet with me on equal terms, as a man, and no longer as a curiosity.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> know. And because <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> ask you {{something}} else. You have been {{brought up in a}} city, and I have always lived here in the country, except the two years I was out with the army. Do you think I should succeed if I pulled up here, and settled in Boston?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not," [...] {{said the}} Duke, with a scowl that was terrible even to his wife. [...] "I <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> speak <b>to</b> you, but <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> {{speak to you}} alone." ...|$|R
5|$|Lance Henriksen was {{concerned}} {{that it would be}} out of character for Frank Black to recklessly take untested drugs, and suggested adding a line of dialogue—"I don't even take aspirin"—to the script to help clue the audience in to the fact that his involvement in the clinical trial was an attempt to aid his daughter. The episode begins with a quotation translated from classical Roman orator Marcus Tullius Cicero's treatise De finibus bonorum et malorum—"I remember the very things I do not wish to; I cannot forget the things <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> forget". The phrase is found at the beginning of Book II of the work.|$|E

25|$|There must be {{world brotherhood}} {{if we are}} to be able to {{practice}} the true art of living, and in this connection <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> emphasize four points.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> him <b>to</b> {{know who}} you were. <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> him <b>to</b> {{understand}} the improbability of your ever again returning to Blakely." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am very thankful," [...] said he to himself, [...] "that I made {{a bargain}} with the captain {{to put me}} ashore {{whenever}} <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> go. <b>I</b> don't believe that <b>I</b> shall <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> go more than half way to Boppard." ...|$|R
5000|$|Laurence (also called Laurent) lives most of {{his life}} as a man and then spends a period living as a woman. Both men and women fall in love with him and he {{responds}} to both. He explains how he has chosen to favor men or women: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> trifle, <b>I</b> preferred the latter. When <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> reason gravely, <b>I</b> chose the former." ...|$|R
25|$|My {{attention}} has been directed to a letter signed W.S. in the Field of July 24th, enclosing a clipping from the Philadelphia Public Ledger, severely criticising the umpiring in the Philadelphian matches during our tour through England. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> state {{on behalf of the}} Philadelphia team that the sentiments expressed in the clipping are not those of the team, and that we emphatically repudiate any insinuation of unfair treatment. On the contrary, we have been received with the most unvarying courtesy and fairness {{both on and off the}} field. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> take this opportunity of making a public acknowledgement of our indebtedness to Mr. Perkins, of the M.C.C., for the umpires assigned to us, and to testify, unnecessary though it be, to their ability and integrity.|$|E
25|$|Mr. Arar, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> {{take this}} {{opportunity}} to express publicly to you and to your wife and to your children how truly sorry I am for whatever part the actions of the RCMP {{may have contributed to the}} terrible injustices that you experienced and the pain that you and your family endured.|$|E
25|$|My only Brother has a {{very large}} family, {{three or four of}} them Boys, and as he has not the means of {{providing}} for them all, in the way <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> see them provided for, I am desirous of having one of them here, to commence in the office, and work his way, by industry and application to business.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't express {{how much}} I {{appreciate}} your telling me this," [...] she said. [...] "I'll confess <b>to</b> you <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> think that {{something of that}} kind had happened. <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> believe that--that you had made this determination alone. When I met you that night {{there was something about}} you I couldn't account for. I haven't been able to account for it until now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you {{may tell}} them <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> you <b>to</b> stay till I can talk some things over with you I have on my mind: to-night {{it is too}} late, and I have a {{difficulty}} in recalling them. But there was something <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> say--let me see--" ...|$|R

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> firmly {{state that}} the Friars and Sisters of the {{religious}} community in Bethlehem cannot be considered as hostages. They have freely chosen to remain in that place, the custody {{of which has been}} entrusted to them by the Holy See, and which constitutes their home. The other 200 Palestinians besieged inside the Basilica have taken refuge there by force in order to flee from the sweep and search by the Israeli army, just as had happened to the 5 Italian journalists during {{the first day of the}} siege. Up to now they have not committed any act of violence or abuse of power against the religious community.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> {{express my}} heartfelt horror at the {{indiscriminate}} terrorist attacks committed against innocent {{people of the}} United States yesterday. While {{it is still not}} clear who carried out the attack, it must be stated that no right-thinking follower of Islam could possibly condone such an action. The Qur'an equates the murder of one innocent person with the murder of the whole of humanity. We pray for the families of all those who lost their lives in this unthinkable act of violence as well as all those injured; I hope to reflect the feelings of all Muslims and people around the world whose sympathies go out to the victims of this sorrowful moment.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> obtain your blessing {{before that}} day, so that I {{may have the}} {{strength}} and light which I need so much {{in order to be}} unto the end a faithful son of our Redeemer, and a loyal and obedient servant of His Infallible Vicar. Now that the Masonic Lodges of the neighboring countries, instigated by Germany, are vomiting against me all sorts of atrocious insults and horrible calumnies, now that the Lodges are secretly arranging for my assassination, I have more need than ever of the divine protection so that I may live and die in defense of our holy religion and the beloved republic which I am called once more to rule.|$|E
60|$|Something {{seemed to}} pass into my {{place that was}} like the angel he thought me, and I felt so sorrowful for the loss he had sustained! <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> help him in his trouble, as <b>I</b> had <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> do when he showed that first commiseration for me.|$|R
60|$|I replied, half {{defeated}} already, that <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> {{speak to}} himself {{only if he}} would give me leave.|$|R
60|$|It was of {{all things}} what <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> avoid that night. But there was no escape. I obeyed her.|$|R
25|$|Mother Jones {{was joined}} by President Keeney and other UMWA {{officials}} who were also pressuring the miners to go home. Although Mother Jones organized for decades {{on behalf of the}} UMWA in West Virginia and even denounced the state as ‘medieval’, the chapter of the same name in her autobiography, she mostly praises Governor Morgan for defending the 1st amendment freedom of the labor weekly The Federationist to publish. His refusal to consent to the mine owners request he ban the paper demonstrated to Mother Jones that he ‘refused to comply with the requests of the dominant money interests. To a man of that type <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> pay my respects’. Apparently Jones didn’t know or overlooked that Morgan had received about $1 million in campaign donations from industrialists in the 1920 election.|$|E
500|$|Your {{loving and}} obedient son wishes unto your grace long {{life in this}} world with as much joy and comfort as ever <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> myself, {{and in the world}} to come joy everlasting. Your humble son to his death, G. Dudley ...|$|E
500|$|Rockwell {{has stated}} that he feels hands are second only to heads in {{importance}} to {{the expression of a}} story. He stated with regards to Freedom of Worship, [...] "I depended on the hands alone to convey about half of the message <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> put over." [...] Rockwell's extensive effort on this work was due to his belief that religion [...] "is an extremely delicate subject. It is so easy to hurt so many people's feelings." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I felt {{compassion}} for him,' said Louisa, her colour deepening, 'and <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> {{know what he}} was going <b>to</b> do, and <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> offer him assistance.' ...|$|R
60|$|I was not pleased, because <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> go to sleep, not to squabble with loafers. “What do you want?” I asked.|$|R
6000|$|... "Does the Captain think, then, that <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> murder him; especially," [...] he added, [...] "after I {{shook his}} hand this morning?" ...|$|R
500|$|In 1902 Robey {{created the}} {{character}} [...] "The Prehistoric Man". [...] He {{dressed as a}} caveman and spoke of modern political issues, often complaining about the government [...] "slapping another pound of rock on his taxes". The character was received favourably by audiences, who found it easy to relate to his topical observations. That year he released [...] "The Prehistoric Man" [...] and [...] "Not That <b>I</b> <b>Wish</b> <b>to</b> Say Anything" [...] on shellac discs using the early acoustic recording process.|$|E
500|$|The cantata {{concludes with}} an aria with the {{complete}} orchestra, [...] "" [...] (<b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> live with God alone). It expresses {{the wish to}} dwell with God forever in a minuet of positive character. The movement again uses a two-part ritornello. When contrasting aspects of life on earth are mentioned, such as [...] "jammerreichen Schmerzensjoch" [...] (sorrowful yoke of pain) and [...] "martervollen Leben" [...] (tormented life), the music darkens to minor keys. The organ supplies triplet figures, which the voice also uses to express [...] "ein fröhliches Halleluja" [...] (a joyful hallelujah).|$|E
500|$|The {{absence of}} Adams from home was hard on Abigail, who {{was left alone}} {{to care for the}} family. But she {{encouraged}} her husband in his task, writing: [...] "You cannot be, I know, nor do <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> see you an inactive Spectator, but if the Sword be drawn I bid adieu to all domestick felicity, and look forward to that Country where there is neither wars nor rumors of War in a firm belief that thro the mercy of its King we shall both rejoice there together." ...|$|E
60|$|It did {{not come}} from the newspapers, nor did I believe it, but <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> be entirely sure it was a falsehood.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I do not <b>wish</b> it - <b>I</b> do not <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> {{know the}} roof that shelters you,' {{interrupted}} the other. 'I heard your name; I feared {{it might be}} you; <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> know if, after all, there were a God; I know now that there is none. Begone!' ...|$|R
