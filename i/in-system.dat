25|$|Because Line 3 is elevated, {{transferring}} to other underground stations typically takes more walking. <b>In-system</b> transfer {{has been introduced}} to all interchange stations except Shanghai Railway Station (where Lines 3 and 4 meets Line 1). Virtual interchange is offered at both stations for Public Transportation Card holders.|$|E
25|$|The station house {{formerly}} had {{two more}} staircases leading to either eastern corner, {{as well as}} another staircase to the northwestern corner. In June 2011, they were replaced by the <b>in-system</b> transfer to the underground platforms, which added a new staircase to the former southeast corner of the intersection. As part of the project, a short strip of 45th Road between 23rd Street and Jackson Avenue was de-mapped, while the adjacent Albert Short Triangle was renovated.|$|E
25|$|The board {{real estate}} savings {{compared}} to a parallel I/O bus are significant, and have earned SPI a solid role in embedded systems. That is true for most system-on-a-chip processors, both with higher end 32-bit processors such as those using ARM, MIPS, or PowerPC and with other microcontrollers such as the AVR, PIC, and MSP430. These chips usually include SPI controllers capable of running in either master or slave mode. <b>In-system</b> programmable AVR controllers (including blank ones) can be programmed using a SPI interface.|$|E
25|$|There are no out-of-system subway-to-subway {{transfers}} allowed (i.e., {{exiting the}} turnstile and entering again; see also Shanghai Metro variant), {{with the exception}} of a transfer between Lexington Avenue / 59th Street on the IRT Lexington Avenue and BMT Broadway Lines and Lexington Avenue / 63rd Street on the IND 63rd Street Line. Until 2011, an extra out-of-system subway-to-subway transfer was allowed between 23rd Street – Ely Avenue/Long Island City – Court Square on the IND Queens Boulevard and Crosstown Lines and 45th Road – Court House Square on the IRT Flushing Line. This transfer was eliminated in 2011 with the opening of an <b>in-system</b> transfer passageway among the three stations.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, the MTA {{planned to}} {{construct}} a transfer passageway between the Queens Boulevard and Crosstown Line stations {{as part of a}} planned connector between the Queens Boulevard Line and the IND 63rd Street Line. Around 1986, Citigroup (then Citicorp) agreed to fund the passageway, at the cost of $8.5 million, as part of a zoning requirement for the construction of the adjacent One Court Square tower; the tower was built as {{part of the process of}} Citicorp splitting up its operations between its different buildings. The company selected the site due to the proximity to the stations. The building opened in 1989, with the passageway completed later on. In 2000, the MTA began designing a second <b>in-system</b> passageway between the Flushing and Crosstown line stations. On December 16, 2001, the 63rd Street Line connector was opened and service on the Queens Boulevard Line was increased, requiring G trains to terminate at Court Square on weekdays. To compensate Crosstown riders going into Queens, a free out-of-system transfer to the Flushing Line station was created.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to complaints from G riders at public hearings about losing a major transfer point to Manhattan-bound trains at Queens Plaza, the MTA {{agreed to a}} number of compromises, including installing a moving sidewalk in the passageway between Court Square and 23rd Street–Ely Avenue (now served by the [...] ) on the Queens Boulevard Line. In addition, a free out-of-system MetroCard transfer to 45th Road–Court House Square on the IRT Flushing Line was created at those two stations. This special transfer was discontinued when construction of an <b>in-system</b> transfer at the corner of 23rd Street and 45th Road that opened on June 3, 2011, which made only the Flushing Line station ADA-accessible. The MTA provided $17 million in funding for making the Crosstown Line accessible as part of the 2015–2019 Capital Program.|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{election}} of pro-reform president Mohammad Khatami in 1997, {{there have been two}} basic approaches, two outlooks, toward the achievement of reform in Iran: [...] "Reformists" [...] within the regime (<b>in-system</b> reformers) essentially believe that the Constitution has the capacity—indeed, the positive potential—to lead the [...] "Revolutionary" [...] government of Iran toward [...] "democracy." [...] By contrast, secularists, who remain outside the regime, basically think that the Constitution contains impediments profound enough to block meaningful reform.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, fundamentalists and <b>in-system</b> reformers {{on one side}} and neo-fundamentalists on the other side are {{struggling}} over [...] "Khomeini’s Islamic Republic" [...] versus [...] "Mesbah’s Islamic administration." [...] Mohammad Taghi Mesbah Yazdi and Ansar-e-Hezbollah call for a change in the Iranian constitution from a republic to an Islamic administration. They believe the institutions of the Islamic Republic, such as the Majlis (Iran's Parliament), are contradictory to Islamic government which is completely centered around Velayat-e Faqih and total obedience to him.|$|E
2500|$|Starting February 20, 2013, {{people are}} able to refill cards with both time and value, so that when a MetroCard is filled with both an {{unlimited}} card and fare value, the unlimited ride portion is used first where applicable. If not started already, the unlimited ride period would begin when the card is next used, and when the unlimited period expires, the regular fare would be charged. On March 3, 2013, a $1 fee was imposed on new card purchases <b>in-system.</b> [...] However, MetroCards purchased through the Extended Sales retail network carry no new card fee.|$|E
2500|$|After the IND 63rd Street Line was {{connected}} to the Queens Boulevard Line in December 2001 (a project known as the [...] "63rd Street Connector"), another unstaffed entrance was added to {{the south end of the}} mezzanine at 45th Road, to allow an out-of-system transfer to the IRT Flushing Line. From this fare control area, a single staircase goes up to the north side of Jackson Avenue at Pearson Street directly outside the staircases to the IRT station. A second staircase to the southwest corner of the intersection no longer exists. In June 2011, this transfer was replaced by an enclosed <b>in-system</b> transfer that consists of two escalators, one elevator, and one staircase connecting both stations.|$|E

The Blue Line is also one of only two lines with more than one station with the same name, with the Green Line being the other (It has two stations at Harlem Avenue: one in the Kennedy Expressway on the Northwest side and one {{on the south side of}} the Eisenhower Expressway in Forest Park, Illinois. It also has two stations on Western Avenue: one on the O'Hare branch and one on the Congress branch). The Blue Line also has only three <b>in-system</b> transfers (all in the Loop), contains a combination of both the oldest and newest portions of 'L' tracks, and does not share tracks with any other 'L' line.|$|E
