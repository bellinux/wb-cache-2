25|$|Although the {{pictures}} were widely derided—"A pot of paint has been flung {{in the face of}} the public", declared the critic Camille Mauclair (1872–1945)—they also attracted some favorable attention. The painting that was singled out for the most attacks was Matisse's Woman with a Hat; the purchase of this work by Gertrude and Leo Stein had a very positive effect on Matisse, who was suffering demoralization <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> reception of his work.|$|E
25|$|The German {{defenders}} {{had prepared}} {{the area with}} blockhouses, minefields, barbed wire, and booby-traps, hidden by the snow. There were also numerous bunkers in the area, mostly belonging to the deep defenses of the Siegfried Line, which were also centers of resistance. The dense forest allowed infiltration and flanking attacks and it was sometimes difficult to establish a front line or to be confident that an area had been cleared of the enemy. The small numbers of routes and clearings had also allowed German machine-gun, mortar and artillery teams to pre-range their weapons and fire accurately. Apart <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> and very cold weather, the dense forest and rough terrain also prevented proper use of the Allied air superiority, which presented great difficulties in spotting any targets.|$|E

25|$|Later in 1622, {{when the}} Dutch fleet {{arrived in the}} Pescadores, the place that Coen {{believed}} {{to be better than}} Macau in a strategic viewpoint, Admiral Reijersen carried out Coen's orders to indiscriminately attack Chinese ships to coerce the Chinese authorities into allowing trade. It was hoped that if this harassment campaign succeeded, the Pescadores might supplant Macau and Manila as a silk entrepôt for the Japan market. However, the opposite effect was achieved as the Chinese started to regard the Hollanders as pirates and murderers because of these raids and the attack on Macau, and hence refused to do trade with them. The Chinese then waged war against the Dutch and defeated them during the Sino–Dutch conflicts from 1623-1624, forcing the Dutch to abandon the Pescadores in 1624 for Formosa, and then the Chinese began to consider the Dutch offer for trade. In the two years in between, Macau naturally reaped the benefits of trade <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> press that the Dutch brought upon themselves.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} that {{accompanied}} the remix opens with {{the scene of a}} woman, relaxing on a futuristic sofa, watching the music video through metallic virtual reality goggles. The video is set in a nightclub. Inside the club, televisions, monitors and walls display the history of Jackson's filmography such as [...] "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough", [...] "Rock with You", [...] "Beat It", [...] "The Way You Make Me Feel", [...] "Man in the Mirror", [...] "Dirty Diana", [...] "Smooth Criminal", [...] "Black or White", [...] "Remember the Time", [...] "In the Closet", [...] "Jam", [...] "Will You Be There", [...] "Scream", [...] "Earth Song", [...] "They Don't Care About Us", [...] "Stranger in Moscow", [...] "Blood on the Dance Floor", scenes from his short film Ghosts, and live performances <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bad</b> and Dangerous tours. Wearing the goggles, the woman is led to believe she is in the nightclub too. The video ends with the woman removing the goggles.|$|E
500|$|Several remixes were {{commissioned}} for [...] "Honey," [...] {{most notably the}} Bad Boy remix and the Classic mix, the latter of which appears on Carey's remix compilation The Remixes (2003). The former {{is similar to the}} original version, {{with the addition of a}} new spoken intro from Carey in which she states, [...] "I thought I told you, we won't stop." [...] The string chords present in the original [...] "Honey" [...] are entirely excised <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bad</b> Boy remix, and it features rapping verses by The Lox and Mase (who did the bridge on the original version). The rap from Mase entirely replaces the second chorus of the song, while the Lox's parts replaces a section of the song's bridge. The song's main remix, [...] "Honey" [...] (Bad Boy remix), has an accompanying music video, with additional sequences directed by Paul Hunter. Much of the footage from the video is from the original, with few new scenes featuring Carey with Puffy, Mase and the Lox in a long golden tunnel flowing with water ("The Honey Tunnel"). During Mase's rap, Carey is rescued by them (rather than joining the sailors on the boat) when he lowers a rope into the ocean from his helicopter.|$|E

500|$|In {{a parody}} of Twilight, Lisa {{falls in love with}} a mysterious new student named Edmund. After saving Lisa from a bus, two cars, a bicycle and a Segway PT, Edmund reveals he is a vampire. Lisa is not frightened by this and the two begin a romance, much to the dismay of Milhouse, who turns into a were-poodle. Marge invites Edmund and his father, Count Dracula, to dinner. Edmund and Lisa are both embarrassed by their fathers and decide to leave. Homer and Dracula track them down to a cathedral in [...] "Dracula-la Land". They see Edmund {{climbing}} up a tower with Lisa, so Homer forces Dracula to carry him up. Lisa wants to become a vampire, explaining that she wants to be a part of their rich culture and to organise events to prevent unfair vampire stereotypes, but has second thoughts after learning that she would be eight years old forever. Edmund says that [...] "the blood-lust is upon him" [...] and he has to bite something. Homer stops Edmund with a cross, and is amazed to learn vampires love their kids also when Dracula grabs the cross to save Edmund. Edmund and his father reconcile, and Homer saves Lisa by offering himself up in her place as the two vampires feast on him. However, they both die <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> cholesterol in Homer's blood as he is turned into a vampire. Transforming into a bat to fly home, Homer's fat causes him to fall to his death. His body is carried off by were-poodle Milhouse while Lisa watches in dismay.|$|E
500|$|Cibber {{had learned}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> example of Christopher Rich to be a careful and approachable {{employer}} for his actors, {{and was not}} unpopular with them; however, he made enemies in the literary world because of the power he wielded over authors. Plays he considered non-commercial were rejected or ruthlessly reworked. Many were outraged by his sharp business methods, which may be exemplified by the characteristic way he abdicated as manager in the mid-1730s. In 1732, Booth sold his share to John Highmore, and Wilks' share fell {{into the hands of}} John Ellys after Wilks' death. Cibber leased his share in the company to his scapegrace son Theophilus for 442pounds, but when Theophilus fell out with the other managers, they approached Cibber senior and offered to buy out his share. Without consulting Theophilus, Cibber sold his share for more than 3,000pounds to the other managers, who promptly gave Theophilus his notice. According to one story, Cibber encouraged his son to lead the actors in a walkout and set up for themselves in the Haymarket, rendering worthless the commodity he had sold. On behalf of his son, Cibber applied for a letters patent to perform at the Haymarket, but it was refused by the Lord Chamberlain, who was [...] "disgusted at Cibber's conduct". The Drury Lane managers attempted to shut down the rival Haymarket players by conspiring in the arrest of the lead actor, John Harper, on a charge of vagrancy, but the charge did not hold, and the attempt pushed public opinion to Theophilus' side. The Drury Lane managers were defeated, and Theophilus regained control of the company on his own terms.|$|E
2500|$|Edge of Honor (1991) US; Stars Corey Feldman about [...] "Northwest Wilderness Explorers" [...] who stumble {{upon some}} stolen weapons {{hidden in a}} shack in the woods of the Olympic {{peninsula}} in Washington.

2500|$|In 2007 Cibernético {{starred in}} as the title {{character}} of a comic book published by [...] "SuperComics". While the comic starred a wrestler {{it was not a}} comic about professional wrestling, instead the story was set in a futuristic Mexico, with Cibernético as a biker saves a small town <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> guys. The story was called [...] "El Ojo Cibernético, e Historias de Carretera", or [...] "The Cybernetic eye, and stories of the highway". In August, 2010 Cibernético was featured in a national television commercial in Mexico for the fast food franchise Burger King.|$|E
2500|$|While {{completing}} the LP When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold, Atmosphere released four EPs as continuations of the [...] "Sad Clown Bad Dub" [...] series. These were Sad Clown Bad Summer 9, Sad Clown Bad Fall 10, Sad Clown Bad Winter 11 and Sad Clown Bad Spring 12. The EPs were {{popular in the}} Minneapolis area due to many references to local places, such as songs named after streets in the area ("66th street", [...] "Lyndale Avenue"). The song [...] "Sunshine", <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bad</b> Summer EP, was released as a single. Despite not having a music video or any promotion, the song became popular among the band's core fan base, eventually becoming a staple in live shows. Later, in 2015, the group released a music video through Rhymesayers Entertainment.|$|E
2500|$|Ginzburg {{noted that}} whether the benandanti were {{themselves}} witches or not was {{an area of}} confusion in the earliest records. Whilst they combated the malevolent witches and helped heal those who were {{believed to have been}} harmed through witchcraft, they also joined the witches on their nocturnal journeys, and the miller Pietro Rotaro was recorded as referring to them as [...] "benandanti witches"; for this reason the priest Don Bartolomeo Sgabarizza, who recorded Rotaro's testimony, believed that while the benandanti were witches, they were 'good' witches who tried to protect their communities <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> witches who would harm children. Ginzburg remarked that it was this contradiction in the relationship between the benandanti and the malevolent witches that ultimately heavily influenced their persecution {{at the hands of the}} Inquisition.|$|E
50|$|Scott {{is widely}} {{known for his}} almost {{identical}} appearance to earlier day Clint Eastwood. This was highlighted by the media when Scott dressed up as Clint Eastwood's character <b>from</b> <b>The</b> Good, <b>the</b> <b>Bad</b> and <b>the</b> Ugly, for a Halloween 2016 charity event.|$|R

2500|$|Writing about {{attempts}} by CAMERA {{to get a}} local Pasadena, California church to cancel an appearance by Palestinian activist Reverend Naim Ateek, Rob Eshman, Editor-in-Chief of The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles, wrote: [...] "I'm always leery when Jewish groups ride in {{from out of town}} to try to save us <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> guys. We have plenty of sharp-eyed Jewish defense groups locally who can tussle on our behalf. It's just a bit condescending to think we rubes, out in America's second-largest Jewish city, don't know how and when to fight. Or whom." [...] Eshman later clarified that his criticism was directed specifically at CAMERA's handling of the Ateek visit, and not toward the organization in general. [...] "I think CAMERA, which in so many cases I find useful and correct, is in this case making things worse," [...] he wrote.|$|E
2500|$|The {{assessments}} {{have not}} been universally favourable. When an exhibition {{was held in the}} United Kingdom in 1993, a reviewer in The Independent described the works as [...] "perhaps the most boring art in the world". Museum curator Philip Batty, who had been involved in assisting the creation and sale of art in central Australia, expressed concern at the effect of the non-indigenous art market on the artists – particularly Emily Kngwarreye – and their work. He wrote [...] "there was always a danger that the European component of this cross-cultural partnership would become overly dominant. By the end of her brief career, I think that Emily had all but evacuated this intercultural domain, and her work simply became a mirror image of European desires". Outstanding art works are mixed with poor ones, {{with the passage of time}} yet to filter the good <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-1980s, Summer was {{embroiled in}} a controversy. She {{allegedly}} had made anti-gay remarks regarding the then-relatively new disease, AIDS. Summer, by this time a born-again Christian, was alleged to have said that AIDS was a punishment from God for the immoral lifestyles of homosexuals. Because of this alleged statement, thousands of her records were returned to her record company and she became {{the target of a}} boycott which hurt her career. Some years later, Summer publicly denied that she had ever made any such comment, and {{in a letter to the}} AIDS campaign group ACT UP in 1989 said it was [...] "a terrible misunderstanding." [...] In explaining why she did not respond to ACT UP sooner, Summer stated [...] "I was unknowingly protected by those around me <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> press and hate letters. If I have caused you pain, forgive me." [...] She closed her letter with Bible quotes (from Chapter 13 of 1 Corinthians).|$|E
50|$|The names Iwabuchi, Moriyama, Shirai (for {{some of the}} {{executives}} in the Nakamoto boardroom) and Koichi Nishi (a pseudonym Eddie Sakamura used to aid the police) are taken <b>from</b> <b>the</b> movie <b>The</b> <b>Bad</b> Sleep Well, which is later mentioned by Connor, though not by title.|$|R

25|$|Morricone's {{influence}} extends {{into the}} realm of pop music. Hugo Montenegro had a hit with a version of <b>the</b> main theme <b>from</b> <b>The</b> Good, <b>the</b> <b>Bad</b> and <b>the</b> Ugly in both the United Kingdom and the United States. This was followed by his album of Morricone's music in 1968.|$|R
2500|$|Vauxcelles {{described}} {{their work with}} the phrase [...] "Donatello chez les fauves" [...] ("Donatello among the wild beasts"), contrasting the [...] "orgy of pure tones" [...] with a Renaissance-style sculpture that shared the room with them. Henri Rousseau was not a Fauve, but his large jungle scene The Hungry Lion Throws Itself on the Antelope was exhibited near Matisse's work and may have had an influence on the pejorative used. Vauxcelles' comment was printed on 17 October 1905 in Gil Blas, a daily newspaper, and passed into popular usage. The pictures gained considerable condemnation—"A pot of paint has been flung {{in the face of}} the public", wrote the critic Camille Mauclair (1872–1945)—but also some favorable attention. One of the paintings singled out for attack was Matisse's Woman with a Hat. This work's purchase by Gertrude and Leo Stein had a very positive effect on Matisse, who had been demoralized <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> reception of his work. Matisse's Neo-Impressionist landscape, Luxe, Calme et Volupté, had already been exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants in the spring of 1905.|$|E
2500|$|Kravitz was {{the subject}} of a photo book by former chief {{photographer}} for Rolling Stone, Mark Seliger.

Diddy, Pharrell and Loon on the track [...] "Show Me Your Soul" [...] <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bad</b> Boys II Soundtrack. In September 2002, Kravitz appeared alongside other rock stars in the episode [...] "How I Spent My Strummer Vacation" [...] of The Simpsons. In early 2003, Kravitz released the track [...] "We Want Peace" [...] as a download-only track as a protest against the 2003 invasion of Iraq, he performed this alongside famous Iraqi singer Kazem Al Saher at Rock The Vote. The track reached #1 on the world internet download charts and MP3.com download chart. Kravitz also appeared on Unity, the official album of the 2004 Athens Olympics, and performed a cover of [...] "Have You Ever Been (To Electric Ladyland)" [...] on the album [...]|$|E
2500|$|On April 23, 2009, viewers {{were expecting}} to see all five members of Danity Kane for {{the second part of}} the finale to find out if Danity Kane would without a doubt be removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bad</b> Boy label or if they would have a [...] "fresh start" [...] as Combs stated in the first part of the finale. During the finale, Fimbres did not show up. Bex {{explained}} that Fimbres did not show up because Fimbres [...] "had been through enough" [...] emotional turmoil with the group and wanted to stay home with family. As for herself not showing up for the 2009 season of Making the Band, Bex said that it was a [...] "personal choice" [...] and was nothing against the fans. Woods said that part of the reason for the group's demise was due to not having a [...] "sound foundation" [...] when it began (five strangers being put together and expected to be emotionally close) and that eventually led to professional and personal problems with the group. O'Day said she has forgiven being released from the group, and people who blamed her for the group's breakup. When asked if Danity Kane could be a group again, O'Day said yes. Woods and Bex said not at this time. Combs said that they need a [...] "time out" [...] for now, particularly to work on their solo or alternative careers, and that he will not reunite Danity Kane unless the group consists of all five original members.|$|E
