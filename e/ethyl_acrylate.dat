40|$|Cell {{enrichment}} {{is currently}} in high demand in medical engineering. We have reported that non-blood cells can attach to a blood-compatible poly(2 -methoxyethyl acrylate) (PMEA) substrate through integrin-dependent and integrin-independent mechanisms because the PMEA substrate suppresses protein adsorption. Therefore, we assumed that PMEA analogous polymers can change the contribution of integrin to cell attachment through the regulation of protein adsorption. In the present study, we investigated protein adsorption, cell attachment profiles, and attachment mechanisms on PMEA analogous polymer substrates. Additionally, we demonstrated the possibility of attachment-based cell enrichment on PMEA analogous polymer substrates. HT- 1080 and MDA-MB- 231 cells started to attach to poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA) and poly(tetrahydrofurfuryl acrylate) (PTHFA), on which proteins could adsorb well, within 1 h.

40|$|Summary. ‐ It {{is shown}} that the acid‐catalysed {{esterification}} of propionic and acrylic acids, by absolute methanol, has a frequency factor which is approximately the same in both cases, and for a given temperature, the rate constants depend on the activation energies only, propionic acid: Ea= 10, 0 Kcal/mole log PZ= 6, 1 (16) acrylic acid: Ea= 12, 4 Kcal/mole log PZ= 6, 2 The same observation is true for another bimolecular reaction i. e. the acid‐catalysed hydrolysis of <b>ethyl</b> propionate and <b>acrylate.</b> <b>ethyl</b> propionate: Ea= 16, 2 Kcal/mole log PZ= 7, 5 (17) ethyl acrylate: Ea= 18, 1 Kcal/mole log PZ= 7, 4. An analogous result is obtained for the acid‐catalysed methanolysis of n‐butyl propionate and acrylate, {{on the one hand}} and the acid‐catalysed butanolysis of methyl propionate and acrylate, on the other hand. Methanolysis: n‐butyl propionate: Ea= 12, 7 Kcal/mole log PZ= 4, 4 n‐butyl acrylate: Ea= 14, 4 Kcal/mole log PZ= 4, 7. Butanolysis: methyl propionate: Ea= 12, 6 Kcal/mole log PZ= 4, 3 methyl acrylate: Ea= 14, 2 Kcal/mole log PZ= 4, 5. The interpretation of the relative values obtained for the activation energies in these alcoholysis reactions is only possible on the basis of a bimolecular mechanism.
