40|$|In deep {{geological}} disposal for high-level radioactive waste, the generated gas can potentially affect the sealing ability of bentonite buffers. There is a competition between water and gas: the former provides sealing by swelling bentonite, {{and the latter}} attempts to desaturate the bentonite buffer. Thus, this study focused on numerically modelling the coupling effects of water and gas on the water saturation and sealing efficiency of compacted bentonite-sand samples. Different <b>gas</b> <b>pressures</b> were applied to the top surface of an upper sample, whereas the water pressure on the bottom side of the lower sample was maintained at 4 [*]MPa. The results indicated that <b>gas</b> <b>pressure</b> did not significantly affect the saturation of the bentonite-sand sample until 2 [*]MPa. At 2 [*]MPa, the degree of water saturation of the upper sample was close to 1. 0. As the <b>gas</b> <b>pressure</b> increased, this influence was more apparent. When the <b>gas</b> <b>pressure</b> was 6 [*]MPa or higher, {{it was difficult for}} the upper sample to become fully saturated.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Students {{tend to have}} a poor {{understanding}} of the concept of <b>gas</b> <b>pressure.</b> Usually, <b>gas</b> <b>pressure</b> is taught in terms of the various formulaic gas laws. The development of the concept of <b>gas</b> <b>pressure</b> according to the early Greeks did not include the concept of a vacuum. It was not for another 2000 years that Torricelli proposed that a vacuum can exist and {{that he was able to}} produce a vacuum above a column of mercury. However, the existence of a vacuum continued to be a contentious issue for at least another 100 years. During this time the behavior of gases was studied by Boyle, Amontons, Gay-Lussac, Daniel Bernouli, Charles, and Dalton. In the 19 th century gas behavior was revisited and studied from the molecular level through the work of Graham, Maxwell, Boltzmann, and van der Waal.

For the generalized Chaplygin <b>gas</b> <b>pressure</b> law, the solution consists of three different structures: R+J, S+J, and δ. Existence and uniqueness of delta shock solution are established under the generalized Rankine-Hugoniot relation and entropy condition.

Secondly, we discuss the limits of Riemann solutions for the modified Chaplygin <b>gas</b> <b>pressure</b> law as the pressure law tends to the generalized Chaplygin gas one. In particular, for some cases, the solution S+J tends to a delta shock wave, and it is different from the delta shock wave for the generalized Chaplygin <b>gas</b> <b>pressure</b> law with the same initial data. Thirdly, we simulate the Riemann solutions and examine the formation process of delta shock wave by employing the Nessyahu-Tadmor scheme.
