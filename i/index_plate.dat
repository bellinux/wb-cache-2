50|$|The {{first true}} {{circular}} dividing engine was probably constructed by Henry Hindley, a clockmaker, around 1739. This {{was reported to}} the Royal Society by John Smeaton in 1785. It was based directly on a gear cutting machine for clockworks. It used a toothed <b>index</b> <b>plate</b> and a worm gear to advance the mechanism. Duc de Chaulnes created two dividing engines between 1765 and 1768 for dividing circular arcs and linear scales. He desired to improve on the graduation of instruments by removing the skill of the maker from the technique where possible. While beam compass use was critically dependent on the skill of the user, his machine produced more regular divisions {{by virtue of its}} design. His machines were also inspired by the prior work of the clockmakers.|$|E
5000|$|Telegraph trains were {{introduced}} by Myer to support telegraphy for mobile operations. The horse-drawn wagons carried the telegraph sets and supplies such as reels of {{insulated copper wire}} and iron lances, for stringing temporary field lines, a practice called [...] "flying telegraph lines." [...] Each train consisted of two wagons, equipped with 5 miles of wire and a telegraph instrument. The first model train was constructed by Henry J. Rogers, a telegraphic engineer from New York City {{who had worked with}} Samuel F.B. Morse in building the first commercial telegraph line between Washington and Baltimore in 1844. Rogers's original telegraph instrument for the train replaced the traditional sending key and sound receiver with a dial indicator, a circular <b>index</b> <b>plate</b> bearing the letters of the alphabet and a pointer that turned to the letter to be transmitted. A similar pointer spelled out the message at the receiving end. Rogers provided a galvanic battery that eliminated the danger of acid spills. This equipment eliminated the need for skilled operators who had to be trained in Morse code. Field trials in February 1862 found that it worked satisfactorily over a test circuit of 2 miles of wire. A board of three signal officers recommended that such a train would be of great use as an auxiliary to permanent telegraph lines.|$|E

5000|$|Interchangeable <b>indexing</b> <b>plates</b> {{are used}} {{when the work}} must be rotated to an angle not {{available}} on the direct <b>indexing</b> <b>plate.</b> Because the hand crank is fixed to the spindle at a known ratio (commonly 40:1) the dividing plates mounted at the handwheel {{can be used to}} create finer divisions for precise orientation at arbitrary angles. These dividing plates are provided in sets of several plates. Each plate has rings of holes with different divisions. For example, an <b>indexing</b> <b>plate</b> might have three rows of holes with 24, 30, and 36 holes in each row. A pin on the hand crank engages these holes. <b>Index</b> <b>plates</b> with up to 400 holes are available. [...] Only one such plate can be mounted to the dividing head at a time. The plate is selected by the machinist based on exactly what angle he wishes to index to.|$|R
5000|$|Direct {{indexing}} plate: Most dividing heads have an <b>indexing</b> <b>plate</b> permanently {{attached to}} the spindle. This plate {{is located at the}} end of the spindle, very close to where the work would be mounted. It is fixed to the spindle and rotates with it. This plate is usually equipped with a series of holes that enables rapid indexing to common angles, such as 30, 45, or 90 degrees. A pin in the base of the dividing head can be extended into the direct <b>indexing</b> <b>plate</b> to lock the head quickly into one of these angles. [...] The advantage of the direct <b>indexing</b> <b>plate</b> is that it is fast and simple and no calculations are required to use it. The disadvantage is that it can only be used for a limited number of angles.|$|R

When the transmission ratio was i, the follower rotated by an angle in different speed intermittently without impact as the driving part made one rotation in the same speed.

In this project an attempt has been made for the design and fabrication of jig and fixture for indexing and positioning of hollow cylindrical component in drilling machine at lesser cost. Quality of the performance of a process largely influenced by the quality of jigs and fixtures used for this purpose. The main purpose of a fixture is to locate and in the cases hold a work piece during an operation. A jig differs from a fixture in the sense that it guides the tool to its correct position or towards its correct movement during an operation in addition to locating and supporting the work piece...|$|E

50|$|A {{rotary table}} is a {{precision}} work positioning device used in metalworking. It enables the operator to drill or cut work at exact intervals around a fixed (usually horizontal or vertical) axis. Some rotary tables allow the use of <b>index</b> <b>plates</b> for <b>indexing</b> operations, and some can also be fitted with dividing plates that enable regular work positioning at divisions for which <b>indexing</b> <b>plates</b> are not available. A rotary fixture used in this fashion is more appropriately called a dividing head (indexing head).|$|R

50|$|The ratio between worm {{and table}} is {{generally}} 40:1, 72:1 or 90:1 {{but may be}} any ratio {{that can be easily}} divided exactly into 360°.

A graduated dial and, often, a vernier scale enable the operator to position the table, and thus the work affixed to it with great accuracy.|$|R
50|$|CNC {{indexing}} heads may {{be controlled}} {{in two different}} modes. The most basic method of operation uses simple control functions built into the dividing head. It {{does not require a}} CNC machine. The operator enters the desired angle into a control box attached to the indexing head and it automatically rotates to the desired position and locks into place for machining. Changing angles is as simple as typing a new angle value onto the control pad. This is simpler than setting up a manual indexing head because {{there is no need to}} interchange <b>indexing</b> <b>plates</b> or to calculate which hole positions to use. It is also faster for repetitive operations because the work can be indexed by simply pressing a button, eliminating the need to count rotations of the hand crank or specific hole positions on the <b>indexing</b> <b>plate.</b> A CNC dividing head may be used in this manner on either manual or CNC machinery.|$|R
50|$|Most {{dividing}} heads {{operate at}} a 40:1 ratio; that is 40 turns {{of the hand}} crank generates 1 revolution of the spindle or workpiece. In other words, 1 turn of the hand crank rotates the spindle by 9 degrees. Because the operator of the machine may want to rotate the part to an arbitrary angle <b>indexing</b> <b>plates</b> are used to ensure the part is accurately positioned.|$|R
