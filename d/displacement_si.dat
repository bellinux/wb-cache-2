40|$|The current {{practices}} of the UK steel foundry industry have been described and a review {{has been made of}} the fracture characteristics and mechanisms which commonly occur in steel castings. Emphasis has been placed on intergranular embrittlement phenomena caused by segregation and precipitation effects, and in particular the role of aluminium nitride has been considered. The problem of A 1 N-induced intergranular fracture (I. F.) has been examined using experimental 0. 30 C- 1. 50 bh castings with varying Al and N contents, and commercially-produced material. The mechanism of fracture has been studied using various optical and electron optical techniques and the existence of two forms of A 1 N (a plate-like form and a dendritic form) has been confirmed. Directional solidification work has shown that the dendritic A 1 N forms in the residual liquid at a late stage of solidification. The plates are precipitated at a later stage when the casting is fully solidified. The plates nucleate at the grain boundaries and grow into the adjacent austenite grains with an orientation relationship of the form (0001) // // { 111 } Y A 1 N Y. The effects of some processing variables on the susceptibility to IF have been examined. IF is favoured by a high Al and N content and a slow cooling rate. The state of heat treatment was also found to be important, with quenched and lightly-tempered samples being more susceptible to IF. A model has been proposed which is based on a comparison of the relative yield strength, cleavage strength and intergranular strength of a casting. This can be used to explain the variation in fracture behaviour with testing temperature. A programme of mechanical testing has shown that different testing techniques and conditions can influence the severity of IF observed quite significantly. Although there may be a considerable decrease in Charpy impact energy as a result of intergranular embrittlement, there is little effect on the initiation value of the crack opening <b>displacement</b> (<b>Si).</b> The C. O. D. at maximum load, (ö), however, max is decreased and the implications with regard to engineering design practices are considered...|$|E
40|$|The {{one-dimensional}} (1 D) {{modeling of}} a turbocharged engine requires {{the availability of}} the turbine and compressor characteristic maps. This leads to two main problems: • performance maps of the turbocharger device are usually limited to a reduced number of rotational speeds, pressure ratios and mass flow rates. Extrapolation of maps’ data is commonly required; • performance maps are experimentally derived on stationary test benches, while the turbocharger usually operates under unsteady conditions, when coupled to an internal combustion engine (ICE). To overcome the above problems, in the present paper the flow inside a rotating pipe of a centrifugal compressor is simulated within a 1 D modeling approach, with the aim of predicting its characteristic map. The main improvement with respect to the employment of a steady experimental map consists in the absence of data extrapolation and in the possibility of fully characterizing the unsteady operation of the component. In this way it is also possible to handle on a physical point of view surge phenomena (backflows) which may arise particularly at low engine speed and high load. To this aim, the actual evolution of the blade-to-blade duct profile is specified through the assignment of proper data which define the duct orientation in the space along its curvilinear abscissa. Flow equations are next generalized to include additional terms arising as a consequence of pipe rotation. The whole compressor is schematized as a number of rotating channels in parallel, linked at the impeller inlet and outlet by a constant pressure boundary condition. The velocity triangles are employed to handle the transition between the absolute and the relative motion occurring at the impeller inlet and outlet. The presence of a vaneless diffuser is also considered at the exit section of the rotor blades. The procedure includes some correlations to keep into account slip effects, incidence and distributed losses. The above methodology is utilized to directly compute the stationary map of the device, starting from the specification of its geometry and rotating speed. A comparison with experimental data shows a good agreement with the predicted performance curves. The same procedure can be easily extended to the simulation of a radial turbine, too. A one-dimensional model of a centrifugal compressor was described in detail under both isentropic and real flow conditions. Classical correlations for the various flow losses and slip effects were introduced in the model, and their effect on the computed results was discussed with reference to a test compressor. The model was then applied to the simulation of a backswept vanes compressor constituting the turbocharger of a small <b>displacement</b> <b>SI</b> engine. The numerical procedure, after a limited adjustment of few tuning constants, was proven to furnish the steady performance map of the device all over its operating region. Both the pressure ratio and the outlet temperature showed a very good agreement with the test data. The stable operating limit of the compressor was also estimated with good accuracy. The proposed methodology was proven to overcome some of the limitations related to the employment of the steady performance map, to compute the engine-turbocharger matching conditions. The direct calculation of the performance map in fact allows avoiding the need of map’s extrapolation and can be realized with the present model basing on few geometrical data of the device. The intrinsic unsteadiness of the methodology also gives the possibility to fully characterize the transient operation of the component. A first example of the model capabilities in describing the unsteady operation of the compressor was included in the paper. The presented results authorize to further develop the model with the objective to describe the unstable operating regime of the compressor. In this way, it will be also possible to handle on a physical point of view surge phenomena (backflows) which may arise particularly at low engine speed and high load...|$|E

40|$|Electronic {{components}} such as {{bipolar junction transistors}} (BJTs) are damaged {{when they}} are exposed to radiation and, as a result, their performance can significantly degrade. In certain environments the radiation consists of short, high flux pulses of neutrons. Electronics components have traditionally been tested against short neutron pulses in pulsed nuclear reactors. These reactors are becoming less and less available; many of them were shut down permanently in the past few years. Therefore, new methods using radiation sources other than pulsed nuclear reactors needed to be developed. Neutrons affect semiconductors such as Si by causing atomic <b>displacements</b> of <b>Si</b> atoms. The recoiled Si atom creates a collision cascade which leads to <b>displacements</b> in <b>Si.</b> Since heavy ions create similar cascades in Si we can use them to create similar damage to what neutrons create.

However, fixation technique {{at the level of}} S 3 has not been well established.

Methods: We reported 2 cases of unstable pelvic injury of an 11 years old boy with Marvin-Tile (MT) C 1 pelvic fracture with sacroiliac (SI) joint disruption, skin avulsion and Morel-Lavallée lesion. Second case was 30 years old male with open pelvic fracture MTB 2 and vertical sacral fracture Denis zone I with Morel-Lavallée lesion, intraperitoneal bladder rupture, infected laparotomy wound dehiscence.

40|$|We {{report on}} the dynamic and {{structural}} characterization of lithium metasilicate Li_ 2 SiO_ 3, a network forming ionic glass, by means of molecular dynamics simulations. The system {{is characterized by a}} network of SiO_ 4 tetrahedra disrupted by Li ions which diffuse through the network. Measures of mean square <b>displacement</b> of <b>Si</b> and O atoms allow us to identify a temperature at which tetrahedra stop moving relative to each other. This temperature T_c≈ 1500 K can be characterized within the framework of mode coupling theory. At a much lower temperature T_g≈ 1000 K, a change in the slope of the volume versus temperature data allows to single out the glass transition. We find signatures of both transitions in structural order parameters, related to the orientation of tetrahedra. Going down in temperature we find that, around the mode coupling transition temperature, a set of order parameters which measure the relative orientation of tetrahedra cease to increase and stay constant below T_c. Another well known measure of orientational order, the bond orientational order parameter, which in the studied system measures local order within single tetrahedrons, is found to continue growing below T_c until T_g, below which it remains constant. Our results allow to relate two characteristic dynamic transitions with corresponding structural transitions, as observed in two different orientational order parameters. Furthermore, the results indicate that the network of thetrahedra continue to relax well below the point where neighboring tetrahedra cannot rearrange relative to each other, and the glass is reached only upon a process of relaxation of atoms which form the thetrahedron, as quantified by the change in the bond orientational order parameters...|$|R

40|$|Knock {{occurrence}} is {{a widely}} recognized phenomenon to be controlled during the development and optimization of S.

As a consequence, {{a clear understanding of}} the engine parameters affecting the onset of auto-ignition is mandatory for the engine setup. In view of the complexity of the phenomena, the use of combined experimental and numerical investigations is very promising. The paper reports such a combined activity, targeted at characterizing the combustion behavior of a small unit <b>displacement</b> two-stroke <b>SI</b> engine operated with either Gasoline or Natural Gas (CNG). In the paper, detailed multi-cycle 3 D-CFD analyses, starting for preliminary 1 D computed boundary conditions, are performed to accurately characterize the engine behavior in terms of scavenging efficiency and combustion. In order to assess the accuracy of the adopted numerical approach, comparisons between numerical forecasts and experimental measurements of instantaneous in-cylinder pressure histories are carried out for both gasoline- and CNG-fueled engine operations. 3 D analyses are also used to investigate the knock sensitivity of the engine to variations of spark timings in a limited set of operating conditions. The activity is simultaneously developed within a 1 D modeling framework, where a detailed quasi-dimensional combustion and knock model is applied to perform a wider investigation of engine performance and knock occurrence for both Gasoline and Natural Gas fuelling. Results from 3 D simulations are here used to improve the 1 D simulations through a better description of scavenging and combustion processes. Once validated, 1 D analyses are in particular finalized to find the knock-limited spark advance by changing both compression ratio and spark timing {{in order to reduce the}} fuel consumption. In this phase, a dedicated routine is also developed to have information on combustion related noise, which may limit fuel consumption improvements. Further confirmations on the validity of the 1 D approach to the modeling of the knock onset are derived from full- 3 D knocking analyses over a limited set of engine operating conditions.

Raman spectra show resolved bands below 500 cm(- 1) region assigned to the modes of SiO 4 and oxygen vibrations. Multiple bands indicate the nonequivalence of the RE-O bonds and the lifting of the degeneracy of the RE ion vibration. Low intensity bands below 500 cm(- 1) are an indication of impurities. The (SiO 4) (4 -) tetrahedra are characterized by bands near 200 cm(- 1) which show a separation of the components of nu(4) and nu(2), in the 500 - 700 cm(- 1) region which are attributed to the distorting bending vibration and in the 880 - 1000 cm(- 1) region which are attributed to the symmetric and antisymmetric stretching vibrational modes. The majority of the bands in the 300 - 610 cm(- 1) region of Re 2 SiO 5 were found to arise from vibrations involving both Si and RE ions, indicating that there is considerable mixing of <b>Si</b> <b>displacements</b> with Si-O bending modes and RE- 0 stretching modes.

Here, {{we report on the}} anisotropic Seebeck coefficient in nanolaminated Ti 3 SiC 2 single-crystal thin films and trace the origin to anisotropies in element-specific electronic states. In bulk polycrystalline form, Ti 3 SiC 2 has a virtually zero Seebeck coefficient over a wide temperature range. In contrast, we find that the in-plane (basal ab) Seebeck coefficient of Ti 3 SiC 2, measured on single-crystal films has a substantial and positive value of 4 - 6 muV/K. Employing a combination of polarized angle-dependent x-ray spectroscopy and density functional theory we directly show electronic structure anisotropy in inherently nanolaminated Ti 3 SiC 2 single-crystal thin films as a model system. The density of Ti 3 d and C 2 p states at the Fermi level in the basal ab-plane is about 40 % higher than along the c-axis. The Seebeck coefficient is related to electron and hole-like bands close to the Fermi level but in contrast to ground state density functional theory modeling, the electronic structure is also influenced by phonons that need to be taken into account. Positive contribution to the Seebeck coefficient of the element-specific electronic occupations in the basal plane is compensated by 73 % enhanced Si 3 d electronic states across the laminate plane that give rise to a negative Seebeck coefficient in that direction. Strong phonon vibration modes with three to four times higher frequency along the c-axis than along the basal ab-plane also influence the electronic population and the measured spectra by the asymmetric average <b>displacements</b> of the <b>Si</b> atoms. These results constitute experimental evidence explaining why the average Seebeck coefficient of Ti 3 SiC 2 in polycrystals is negligible over a wide temperature range.

Anatomic adaptations in the SI zone are thought to {{provide the basis for}} cochlear resonance to the CF 2 echoes and for the extremely sharp tuning throughout the auditory system that allows these bats to detect Doppler shifts in the echoes caused by insect wing beat. We measured basilar membrane (BM) <b>displacements</b> in the <b>SI</b> zone with a laser interferometer and recorded acoustic distortion products at the ear drum at frequencies represented in the SI zone. The basilar membrane in the SI region was tuned both to its characteristic frequency (62 - 72 kHz) and to the resonance frequency (61 - 62 kHz). With increasing stimulus levels, the displacement growth functions are compressive curves with initial slopes close to unity, and their properties are consistent with the mammalian cochlear amplifier working at high sound frequencies. The sharp basilar membrane resonance is associated with a phase lag of 180 °and with a shift of the peak resonance to lower frequencies for high stimulus levels. Within the range of the resonance, the distortion product otoacoustic emissions, which have been attributed to the resonance of the tectorial membrane in the SI region, are associated with an abrupt phase change of 360 °. It is proposed that a standing wave resonance of the tectorial membrane drives the BM in the SI region and that the outer hair cells enhance, fine tune, and control the resonance.

Although the radiation damage end states for Ge[111] and Ge[111] [...] are very similar, i.e., Ge FP defects, the mechanisms of defect generation are different. In the case of Ge[111], the Ge PKA moves 4.77  Å away from its lattice site and forms a Geint defect. For the Ge[111], the Ge atom moves along the [111] [...] direction to replace its neighboring Ge atom. The collided Ge atom moves along this direction and occupies an interstitial site in the end. It is noted that the Ed values of 16  eV for Ge[001] and 17.5  eV for Ge[001] [...] are comparable with the value of 18  eV for Ge[001] in bulk Ge, whereas the associated defects show different character. In the case of Ge[001], the Ge PKA receives sufficient energy but scatters along the [111] direction to replace its neighboring Si atom, forming a GeSi antisite defect. Then, the replaced Si atom occupies the Ge PKA lattice site and forms an antisite defect (SiGe). In the case of Ge[001], the Ge PKA moves 5.63  Å away to replace its neighboring Si atom. The Si atom moves along this direction and forms a Siint defect. As compared with the Ge[110] in bulk Ge, the Ed for Ge[110] in Si/Ge SL is 8.5  eV smaller, and the associated defects are more complex, as indicated by one VGe, one GeSi, and one Siint defects. Comparing the Ge recoil events in bulk Ge and SL, we find that the Ge atoms in Si/Ge SL are more resistant along the [110] direction. For other displacement events, the Eds are generally comparable with those for bulk states. However, the radiation damage end states in bulk Ge and Si/Ge SL are different, and some antisite defects are created in Si/Ge SL structure. These results suggest that the Ge recoils in Si/Ge SL structure show different radiation responses to irradiation. Comparing the Si and Ge recoils in SL structure, we find that the <b>displacement</b> events of <b>Si</b> atoms are much more affected than Ge, i.e., the Eds for Si atoms in SL structure are generally increased, which may lead to enhanced radiation resistance of Si/Ge SL.

40|$|Defects have a {{dramatic}} effect on the properties of semiconductors. In SiC, intrinsic defects can be introduced during growth or device-processing steps such as implantation. In this work electron irradiation {{has been used for}} the controlled generation of defects in SiC. The irradiated material has been annealed and subsequent low temperature photoluminescence (LTPL) measurements have been performed. A key element in this work has been the ability to perform both the irradiation and characterisation on a microscopic scale. These results have allowed a variety of new optical centres to be discovered, and have also significantly enhanced the pool of knowledge about other defect centres. Utilising low voltage irradiations has enabled the electron irradiation voltage displacement thresholds for Carbon and Silicon displacements to be investigated. In 4 H-SiC the electron irradiation voltage displacement thresholds were found to be 88 kV for C displacement and 225 kV for <b>Si</b> <b>displacement.</b> A large number of previously unreported luminescence features have been measured in 4 H, 6 H and 15 R-SiC material. The criteria used for comparison are the voltage threshold, annealing characteristics, spatial distribution with respect to the irradiated region, and the characteristics of associated local modes and vibronic structures. Compelling evidence has been found to support the assignment of centres in 4 H and 6 H-SiC to a C-C dumbbell split interstitial defect. Two high energy local modes at 133 meV and 180 meV are associated with these centres. In " 1 " 3 C enriched 6 H-SiC material the 180 meV local mode splits into three components whilst the 133 meV local mode splits into two components. This splitting is interpreted as being caused by isotopic substitutions between the components of the C-C dumbbell. The high energy local mode corresponds to the bonding between the two constituent atoms of the dumbbell whilst the low energy local mode is associated with the bonding between either a C" 1 " 3 or " 1 " 2 C atom with the nearest Si atom. A new centre that is common to 4 H, 6 H and 15 R-SiC has been investigated. The dominant component of this centre is measured at 673 nm, 764 nm and 766 nm in 4 H, 6 H and 15 R-SiC respectively and are collectively known as the B 1 centre. The centres exhibit an intermediate irradiation voltage threshold value that is approximately mid-way between the threshold associated with the generation of isolated C and Si vacancies. It is likely that a C-Si dumbbell split interstitial complex would be generated at these voltages and {{this is consistent with the}} two-fold splitting exhibited by all components of the B 1 centre in " 1 " 3 C 6 H-SiC material. Equivalent features to the alphabet lines in 4 H-SiC and the neutral silicon vacancy (V_S_i" 0) related features in 4 H and 6 H-SiC have been investigated in 4 H, 6 H and 15 R-SiC polytypes. The 'equivalent' alphabet lines exhibit virtually identical characteristics in all polytypes that are consistent with the proposed isoelectronic natures of the defect centres. Considerable spectral variety was found in the energy range associated with the V_S_i" 0 luminescence with the intermittent appearance of additional features attributed to regions with a high density of stacking faults. It has been proposed that remnant electric Fields, perturbations to the Fermi level and intrinsic stress are responsible for the spatial variations in the energy and intensity exhibited by some centres.

40|$|Heteroepitaxial {{growth of}} Ge on Si is a prototypical system for {{studying}} strained Stranski-Krastanow growth. The technological drawback {{is that it}} turns out to be difficult to grow Ge on Si in a controlled layer-by-layer manner. After a few smooth layers have been grown epitaxially, the growth then proceeds by the formation of islands. This is known as the Stranski-Krastanov growth mode. It has been found, however, that deposition of a single monolayer of As, Sb or Bi onto the silicon surface before growth of Ge begins, can overcome the problem. The Ge then grows epitaxially in a two-dimensional mode, while the surfactant (As, Sb or Bi) atoms apparently rise up through the growing Ge layers and segregate on the top of the film. This is called surfactant mediated growth (SME). Surfactant mediated growth of Ge on Si(111) has been well studied in the last decade. Initial investigations used As and Sb as surfactants. In fact, Ge p-channel MOSFETs have already been fabricated using the Sb surfactant. However for the Bi surfactant, the studies were not so thorough. In the thesis work presented here, we show that Bi is more promising surfactantmaterial than Sb. We demonstrate that by using Bi as a terminating layer on Ge/Si surface, it is possible to distinguish between Si and Ge in Scanning tunnelling microscope (STM). Something which was very difficult in the past. Using this property, it is possible to create Ge/Si nanostructures in a controlled manner. Moreover, it is also possible to study Ge/Si intermixing in surface layers in some detail. Any attempt to utilize surfactant mediated growth must be preceded by a thorough study of its effect on the the system being investigated. Thus, the third chapter of this thesis deals with an extensive study of the Bi surfactant mediated growth of Ge on Si(111) surface as a function of Ge coverage. The growth is investigated from the single bilayer Ge coverage till the Ge coverage of about 15 BL when the further Ge deposition leads to two-dimensional growth. In the fourth chapter, the unique property of Bi terminating layer on Ge/Si surface to result in an STM height contrast between Si and Ge is explained with possible explanations given for the reason of this apparent height contrast. The controlled fabrication of Ge/Si nanostructures such as nanowires and nanorings is demonstrated. A study on Ge-Si diffusion in the surface layers by a direct method such as STM was impossible previously because of the similar electronic structure of Ge and Si. Since with the Bi terminating surface layer, one is able to distinguish between Ge and Si, the study of intermixing between them is also possible using STM. This method to distinguish between Si and Ge allows one to study intermixing on the nanoscale and to identify the fundamental diffusion processes giving rise to the intermixing. In Chapter 5 we discuss how this could prove useful especially as one could get a local probe over a very narrow Ge -Si interface. On one hand it is possible to study the <b>displacement</b> of the <b>Si</b> and Ge atoms when factors like temperature and deposition rate are varied during growth. On the other hand, a post growth study like annealing already grown Ge-Si wires over a period of time could also be performed. A new model is proposed to estimate change in the Ge concentration in the surface layer with time. The values of the activation energies of Ge/Si exchange and Si/Ge exchange are estimated by fitting the experimental data with the model. During step flow growth of Ge wires along Si step edges, the step speed is seen to strongly affect the Ge/Si intermixing. Ge wires grown at faster step speeds appear higher than Ge wires grown at slower step speeds. In chapter 5, the Ge/Si intermixing has been studied on a surface having 1 ML Bi reconstruction. In Chapter 6, we discuss the Ge-Si intermixing on surfaces with different reconstruction, such as the 1 / 3 ML Bi reconstruction and the Si reconstruction. The vertical Ge-Si intermixing is more in the surface with the Si reconstruction as compared to the surface with 1 / 3 ML Bi reconstruction. This is due to the reason that the Bi layer inhibits Ge atoms from exchanging with Si substrate atoms during Ge growth. In the last chapter, an attempt has been made to elucidate the need for utilizing two dimensional Bi surfactant Ge/Si surfaces for industrial applications as transistors by demonstrating the quick, efficient and complete removal of Bi surfactant monolayer from thick Ge layers by ion beam sputtering without damaging the underlying Ge/Si layer...|$|R
40|$|Silicon dioxide (SiO 2) films {{grown on}} silicon {{monocrystal}} (Si) substrates form the gate oxides in current Si-based microelectronics devices. The understanding at the atomic scale {{of both the}} silicon oxidation process and {{the properties of the}} Si(100) -SiO 2 interface is of significant importance in state-of-the-art silicon microelectronics manufacturing. These two topics are intimately coupled and are both addressed in this theoretical investigation mainly through first-principles calculations. We first address the atomic structure at the interface. We construct atomistic models of the Si(100) -SiO 2 interface accounting for the density of coordination defects, the amount and location of partially oxidized Si atoms, and the mass density profile, as measured in electron-spin-resonance, photoemission, and X-ray reflectivity experiments, respectively. A variety of model interfaces are obtained, differing by the degree of complexity in the transition region. The nature of the transition structure at Si(100) -SiO 2 interface is investigated by addressing the inverse ion-scattering problem. In particular, we refer to a new set of ion-scattering measurements carried out in the channeling geometry to achieve sensitivity to <b>Si</b> <b>displacements</b> at the interface. To interpret these experimental data, we perform ion-scattering simulations on a selected set of model interfaces presenting different atomic-scale features in the transition region at the Si(100) -SiO 2 interface. Silicon displacements larger than 0. 09  Å are found to propagate for three layers into the Si substrate. Transition structures consistent with these distortions include Si-Si in-plane dimers, O-protrusion, and/or disordered bond patterns at the Si(100) -SiO 2 interface. A transition structure with regularly ordered O bridges results inconsistent with experiments. We then address the silicon oxidation process. We first focus on the diffusion limited regime occurring during the growth of thick oxide films. In particular, we provide an atomic-scale description of the long-range oxygen migration through the disordered SiO 2 oxide. The O 2 molecule is firmly identified as the transported oxygen species and is found to percolate through interstices without exchanging oxygen atoms with the network. The associated activation energy is found in agreement with experimental values. Then, we address the O 2 diffusion rate through the thin oxide layer at the Si-SiO 2 interface. In particular, we investigate the combined effect of a percolative diffusion mechanism and of a dense oxide layer located close to the silicon substrate. We find that when a thin densified layer is present at the Si(100) -SiO 2 interface, the O 2 diffusion rate drops below its value for bulk amorphous SiO 2 for oxide thicknesses larger than 2  nm. These results support the blocking layer model introduced to explain the failure of the Deal and Grove model in describing the oxidation kinetics of thin oxide films. Finally, the atomic scale mechanisms responsible for oxidation at the Si(100) SiO 2 interface are addressed. First we focus on the properties of negative oxygen species in amorphous SiO 2. We initially focus on the relative energetics of neutral and negative oxygen species in both the atomic and the molecular state. The energy landscape and the dissociation properties of the O 2 - and O 22 - are also considered. We find that, in amorphous SiO 2, the negative oxygen species incorporate in the oxide network and are accommodated by significant network distortions. The investigation of the dissociation processes of the negatively charged molecular oxygen species in amorphous SiO 2 highlights the dependence of the dissociation energies on the disordered nature of the network and on the charge carried by the oxygen molecule. In a second stage, we address the atomistic processes occurring at the Si(100) SiO 2 interface. We consider the neutral O 2 molecule and the negatively charged molecular species. In the case of the neutral O 2 molecule, different spin states are investigated. For all these species we study sequentially the network incorporation and the dissociation process. We find that at the Si(100) -SiO 2 interface all these species incorporate in the network either spontaneously or by crossing small energy barriers. In the vicinity of the interface, the neutral O 2 molecule attacks and penetrates into Si-Si bonds. This process is favored by the charge transfer from the Si-Si bonds to the molecular species. The triplet spin state of the O 2 molecule narrows the channels for network incorporation. Indeed, molecules in the triplet spin state preferentially incorporate in the network in correspondence of the upper layer of the Si substrate. Negatively charged species spontaneously incorporate in any Si-Si bond of the oxide, regardless from distance from the interface. Their incorporation is often associated to the formation of network defects, confirming their ability to modify the network. After the incorporation process, the dissociation and hence the oxidation of Si-Si bonds is spontaneous. We find either vanishing or very small dissociation energies. The energy required for crossing the small barriers is provided by the energy gained during the incorporation process. These results are consistent with a variety of experimental observations...|$|R
