5|$|As {{microwave}} systems entered service, {{along with}} updated versions of aircraft carrying them, the problem arose {{of what to}} <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> aircraft carrying Mk. IV that were otherwise serviceable. One possibility, suggested as early as 1942, was homing in on the Luftwaffe's own radar sets. The basic operational frequencies of the Luftwaffes counterpart to the Mk. IV, the FuG 202 Lichtenstein BC radar, had been discovered in December 1942. On 3 April 1943 the Air Interception Committee ordered the TRE to begin considering the homing concept under the codename Serrate. As luck would have it, this proved to be perfect timing. In the late afternoon of 9 May 1943, a crew from IV/NJG.3 defected to the UK by flying their fully equipped Ju 88R-1 night fighter, D5+EV, to RAF Dyce in Scotland, giving the TRE their first direct look at the Lichtenstein.|$|E
25|$|In an October 2013 interview, Mick Jones {{confirmed}} that Strummer indeed had intentions of reforming the Clash and new music was even being written. In the {{months prior to}} Strummer's death, he and Jones got together to write new music. Jones {{said at the time}} he assumed the new songs would be used on albums with the Mescaleros. A few months following their work together, Jones ran into Strummer at an event and asked him what he intended to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> songs. Strummer informed Jones {{that they were going to}} be used for the next Clash record.|$|E
500|$|Murphy hounded Pat Kiernan {{until he}} got an {{audition}} at Corcadorca, and in September 1996, he made his professional acting debut on the stage, playing {{the part of a}} volatile Cork teenager in Enda Walsh's Disco Pigs. Walsh recalled meeting and discovering Murphy: [...] "There was something about him– he was incredibly enigmatic and he would walk into a room with real presence and you'd go, [...] "My God". It had nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> bloody eyes that everyone's going on about all the time." [...] Murphy observed, [...] "I was unbelievably cocky and had nothing to lose, and it suited the part, I suppose." [...] Originally intended to run for three weeks in Cork, Disco Pigs ended up touring throughout Europe, Canada and Australia for two years, and Murphy left both university and his band. Though he had intended to go back to playing music, he secured representation after his first agent caught a performance of Disco Pigs, and his acting career began to take off.|$|E

2500|$|When White and {{his wife}} {{returned}} to Newark, they were not in a prosperous situation. In order {{to make ends meet}} he and his bride moved in with his parents, and he continued to work long hours at his bookkeeping job. He initially had no interest in pursuing photography as a possible career, and even after he became successful he continued to work as a bookkeeper for many years. Most of his earnings went to providing for his family, and his early involvement in photography was financially challenging. Later his student Ralph Steiner recalled that White told him during this period he had money for only two glass plate negatives each week, and he would spend every spare moment planning what he would <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> two plates on his weekend." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brand {{told this}} story to the Kastner libel trial in 1953, but in his {{autobiography}} published in 1956, he added a caveat [...] "I afterwards heard that the man with whom I spoke was not, in fact, Lord Moyne, but another British statesman. Unfortunately I have no means of verifying this." [...] Brand later testified in the Eichmann trial in 1961 that it was Moyne who said [...] "What shall I <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> million Jews?" [...] The story of the remark, attributed to Moyne, is regularly quoted by historians. Historian Bernard Wasserstein believes that [...] "the truth is that Brand almost certainly never met Moyne". This is supported by Shlomo Aronson, who traces the remark to a comment made {{by the head of}} the Refugee Section of the Foreign Office, Alec Randall, which was later repeated by Moshe Shertok at a meeting which Brand attended.|$|E

2500|$|Later on September 10, the Clinton {{campaign}} {{announced it}} would return the full $850,000 in donations that Hsu had raised from others: [...] "In light of recent events and allegations that Mr. Norman Hsu engaged in an illegal investment scheme, we have decided out of an abundance of caution to return the money he raised for our campaign. An estimated 260 donors this week will receive refunds totaling approximately $850,000 from the campaign." [...] In doing so, the Clinton camp set a precedent for how campaigns should deal with potential [...] "bundling" [...] scandals. [...] The campaign also {{announced it would}} put into place tougher procedures for vetting major contributors, including running criminal background checks. [...] Hsu-raised bundles had also gone to Clinton's political action committee and to her 2006 Senate re-election campaign; Clinton officials were undecided regarding what to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> funds.|$|E
2500|$|At the time, Fătu also {{functioned as}} one of Iași's head {{physicians}} and curator (epitrop) of Sfântul Spiridon Hospital, publishing in 1873 {{a report on the}} foundation, its furnishings, and its work. This activity of his was coming under scrutiny from Junimea. The club's doyen, Titu Maiorescu, noted in 1875 that most of Fătu's contributions were not fully philanthropic, as he claimed and expected others to perform: [...] "To work for money only, now there is something Dr. Fătu knows how to <b>do,</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> 2,800 francs he picks up at the botanical garden, and a similar sum from the Academic Society, and so much more from Sfântul Spiridon etc., and then he presents himself as a great patriot." [...] Ultimately, in 1876, with Ion Ghica taking over as Academy chairman, Fătu was also replaced as vice president by George Bariț. In July of that year, selected by Poni and voted in by other inductees, he became a [...] "special member" [...] of the Medical and Naturalist Society, charged with curating its botanical fund.|$|E
2500|$|Shoemaker also {{addressed}} an AA group in Charlotte, North Carolina, June 17, 1962 saying:To {{set the record}} straight, that there has gotten going in AA, a kind of rumor, that I {{had a lot to}} do with the 12 steps. I didn't have anymore to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> 12 steps other than that book had, those twelve steps, I believe came to Bill by himself, I think he told me they came to him in about 40 minutes and I think its one of the great instances of direct inspiration that I know in human history, inspiration which doesn't only bring material straight down outta heaven, but brings rather I think from God the ability to interpret human experience in such a way that you distill it down into transmissible principles, I compare it to Moses going up on a mountain and bringing down Ten tables of the Law, I don't think that's the first time Moses ever thought about righteousness, but I'm glad he went up there and got those ten and brought em down and gave em to us. And I'm glad Bill got quiet for those 40 minutes, until he finished off these 12 steps and I believe they have only been changed by about one word. Bill said at the end of this talk [...] "Who invented AA?, It was God almighty that invented AA, but this is the story of how we learned to be Free." [...] And he closed by saying [...] "God grant that AA and the program of recovery, and unity, and service be a story that continues into the future as long as God needs it." [...] Praise be to God for it, and for the life of that fellow and all those who where with him in the beginnings of this incredible movement.|$|E

2500|$|Executive {{producer}} Kelly Souders {{explained that}} the loss of show creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, as well as series regulars Michael Rosenbaum and Kristin Kreuk {{at the end of the}} seventh season, forced the creative team to look at the show from a new angle. As Souders explained, it allowed the writers to work with [...] "blank slates", and come up with ways to [...] "reinvigorate and reinvent the show". Executive producer Darren Swimmer explained that this season would feature Chloe's powers manifesting in a way that they have not previously been seen. He went on to express that the theme of season eight would be [...] "double identity"; specifically, Swimmer explained that Clark would begin to understand that he is going to have to live a double life, or he will never be able to continue forward with his destiny. Season eight would be about Clark moving forward to his destiny in a way that the show has never attempted before. Swimmer further explained that Clark will be acting more with his superpowers, whereas previously he would [...] "react" [...] to the situation; [...] "he's going to seek out trouble." [...] Clark joined the Daily Planet to help his cause, using the Planet as a means to get information about where there is trouble. Clark's heroic actions put him in Jimmy's sights, who starts connecting things to Clark; this helped fuel Clark's decision to develop a [...] "secret identity". Another reason for Clark's decision to develop a secret identity will be the stark contrast between saving people in the secluded streets of Smallville, and saving people in the crowded streets of Metropolis. While working at the Daily Planet, Clark was paired up with Lois on various assignments. Lois Lane actress Erica Durance, explained the episodes would be more focused on her character than they have been in the past, and that Lois and Clark would be both rivals and supportive partners to each other. Durance also revealed that Lois would begin to realize her true romantic feelings for Clark, but that she does not want him to know the truth because she does not know what she wants to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> feelings. Season eight explored these romantic notions between the two characters. Jeph Loeb added that season eight would explore more of the DC Comics mythology, and would introduce new characters, as well as expand on already existing ones in Smallville continuity. Peterson also revealed that there would be a chance that the show would break the [...] "No flights, no tights" [...] rule, at least in regard to the flying part of the rule.|$|E
2500|$|In 1950, the Soviets loaded Puyi and {{the rest}} of Manchukuo and Japanese prisoners onto a train that took them to China with Puyi {{convinced}} he would be executed when he arrived. At the border, there were two lines of soldiers, one Soviet and the other Chinese, and as Puyi walked past, he remembered how the faces of the other prisoners were [...] "deathly pale". Puyi was surprised at the kindness of his Chinese guards, who told him this {{was the beginning of a}} new life for him. In attempt to ingratiate himself, Puyi for the first time in his life used ni (你), the informal word for you instead of nin (您), the formal word for you to address people. When the train stopped at Changchun to pick up food, Puyi was convinced that was he was going to be shot at his former capital, and he was much relieved when the train resumed its journey to Fushun. Except for a period during the Korean War, when he was moved to Harbin, Puyi spent ten years in the Fushun War Criminals Management Centre in Liaoning province until he was declared reformed. The prisoners at Fushun were senior Japanese, Manchukuo and Kuomintang officials and officers. Puyi was the weakest and most hapless of the prisoners, and was often bullied by the other prisoners, who liked to humiliate an emperor, and he might not have survived his imprisonment except for the fact that the warden Jin Yuan went out of his way to protect him. Jin had grown up under Manchukuo and as a schoolboy in the 1930s had kowtowed to portraits of Puyi and waved the Manchukuo flag in the streets when Puyi made visits to Harbin. As Jin had grown up in Manchukuo, he was fluent in Japanese, which was why he was selected to be the warden of Fushun. Jin was assigned the job in 1950 and told Behr in a 1986 interview that: [...] "I didn't welcome the idea at all. I tried to get another posting. I wanted nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> who had been responsible for my older brother's death and my family's suffering during the Manchukuo years. I wondered how I could ever bear to be in their company". However, Jin further told Behr that he [...] "came to like Puyi quite a bit" [...] as he got to know him, and protected him from the other prisoners. In 1951, Puyi learned for the first time that Wanrong had died in 1946.|$|E
