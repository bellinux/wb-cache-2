40|$|Although tumor {{gene therapy}} falls behind its {{clinical}} use, {{the combination of}} irradiation and gene therapy is full of promise in cancer therapy based on traditional radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery. We have termed it as radiogenic therapy.

40|$|This {{review of}} the {{literature}} was conducted by Flinders University (SA Community Health Research Unit and Southgate Institute for Health Society & Equity) to provide an overview of changing communications in health promotion to inform the Falls Prevention Project of Country Health SAâ€™s Local Health Network. The context is that falls health literacy information is being increasingly made available via digital formats, including the Internet. This is in line with healthcare around the world increasingly moving to e-health (the <b>delivery</b> <b>or</b> <b>enhancement</b> of health services through the Internet and related technologies). There are particular expectations that for rural Australians making health services and information available through digital formats will overcome existing problems with access and availability. Despite a large amount of activity in the area of e-health, there is a scarce evidence base on the equity impacts of e-health promotion...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Bacterial virus phi 29 genomic DNA is {{packaged}} into a procapsid shell {{with the}} aid of a motor containing a 12 -subunit connector channel and a hexameric pRNA (packaging RNA) ring. The wide end, or the C-terminus, of the cone-shaped connector is embedded within the procapsid shell, whereas the narrow end, or N-terminus, extends outside of the procapsid, providing a binding location for pRNA. Recently, we have reported the mechanism of in vivo assembly of an ellipsoid nanoparticle with seven connectors through an interaction among a peptide tag. Here we report the formation of a similar nanoparticle in vitro via the addition of DNA or RNA oligos to connector proteins. Free connectors guided by one or two copies of oligonucleotides were assembled into a rosette structure containing 60 subunits of reengineered proteins. The number of oligonucleotides within the particle is length-dependent but sequence-independent. Reversible shifting between the 12 - and 60 -subunit nanoparticles (between individual connectors and rosette structures, respectively) was demonstrated by the alternative addition of oligonucleotides and the treatment of ribonuclease, suggesting a potential application as a switch or regulator in nanobiotechnology. This advancement allows for a simple method to produce multivalent nanoparticles that contain five 12 -unit nanoparticles with defined structure and stoichiometry. That is, it will be possible to assemble nanoparticles in vitro with the combination of 60 assortments of ligands, tags, therapeutic drugs, and diagnostic moieties for multivalent <b>delivery</b> <b>or</b> <b>enhancement</b> of signal detection in nanotechnological and nanomedicinal applications...|$|E

40|$|Physician cognition, {{metacognition}} {{and affect}} {{may have an}} impact upon the quality of clinical reasoning. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the relationship between measures of physician metacognition and affect and patient outcomes in obstetric practice. Reflective coping (RC), proactive coping, need for cognition (NFC), tolerance for ambiguity, state-trait anxiety and metacognitive awareness were assessed for obstetricians (n = 12) who provided intra-partum care to 4, 149 women. Outcome measures included delivery mode and intrapartum asphyxia. Analysis was carried out using logistic regression and tree-based classification. Obstetricians with high RC scores were more likely to perform a caesarean section (OR 1. 59, p < 0. 0001), less likely undertake a mid-forceps <b>or</b> low forceps <b>delivery</b> (<b>OR</b> 0. 41, p < 0. 0001; OR 0. 49, p < 0. 0001), and more likely to supervise a spontaneous vaginal <b>delivery</b> (<b>OR</b> 1. 17, p = 0. 08). Obstetricians with high NFC scores were more likely to perform a caesarean section (OR 1. 53, p = 0. 03), more likely to undertake a vacuum <b>delivery</b> (<b>OR</b> 5. 8, p = 0. 001), less likely undertake a mid-forceps <b>delivery</b> (<b>OR</b> 0. 45, p = 0. 02) and less likely to supervise a spontaneous vaginal <b>delivery</b> (<b>OR</b> 0. 47, p < 0. 0001). Obstetricians high in trait anxiety were more likely to perform a mid forceps <b>delivery</b> (<b>OR</b> 2. 49, p = 0. 01) <b>or</b> a vacuum <b>delivery</b> (<b>OR</b> 5. 08, p = 0. 003), and less likely to supervise a spontaneous vaginal <b>delivery</b> (<b>OR</b> 0. 38, p < 0. 0001). NFC was negatively associated (OR 0. 10, p < 0. 001) and trait anxiety was positively associated with intrapartum asphyxia (p < 0. 05, rho = 0. 582). In summary, physician cognitive processes and affect have a significant impact on patient outcomes, particularly in situations where there is a higher level of clinical unpredictability...|$|R
