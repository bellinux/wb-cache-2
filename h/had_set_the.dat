5|$|Although Hancock won Georgia's {{popular vote}} easily, {{there was an}} {{irregularity}} in that state’s electoral votes. According to Article II, Section 1, clause 3 of the Constitution, “The Congress may determine the Time of choosing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.” In 1792, Congress <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> date for the Electoral College {{to vote on the}} first Wednesday in December, which in 1880 fell on December 1. However, Georgia’s electors failed to cast their ballots on December 1, instead voting on the following Wednesday, December 8. Congress chose to count Georgia's vote in the official tally anyway; had they not done so, Hancock’s electoral vote would have been 144, not 155.|$|E
5|$|Authorities rapidly {{ruled out}} the {{possibility}} that ETA had a cell in the island, with police believing the attack had been carried out by a unit that had travelled to the island specifically to carry it out. Initial reports stated that the bombers <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> bomb off with a remote control. Once the second bomb was spotted, police announced that it had a timer device, which could have allowed the members of ETA to plant the bomb several days before the attack and leave the island. Earlier, Government delegate for Majorca, Ramon Socías, had said that security forces believed that the bombers had not left Majorca, and were hiding on the island, waiting for the situation to cool down before attempting to leave.|$|E
5|$|Coach Friedgen named Smith {{the special}} teams captain for the Virginia game. During the game, Virginia chose to kick short {{to keep the}} ball away from Smith on kickoffs, and quarterback Chris Turner did not target him until the fourth quarter. He {{finished}} with three receptions for 34yards and no returns. He recorded two receptions for 13yards at Duke. At NC State, he caught eight passes for 64yards and returned a kickoff 84yards for a touchdown. During the game, he surpassed the ACC single-season kickoff return yards record which he <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> previous season. He had four receptions for 55yards against 21st-ranked Virginia Tech, seven receptions for 71yards against Florida State, and six receptions for 68yards and a touchdown against Boston College.|$|E

5|$|Colton, the Clerk of the Court and {{preparer}} of the writs {{and process}} of the court, <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> first session of county court {{to be held at}} his home, in Coltonville. In his attempt to make Coltonville the county seat, Colton decided to hold a new election for the status. Colton made sure that Coltonville would win the election by telling only the population of Coltonville about it. His political tactics were eventually cancelled by an act of the Illinois General Assembly, after the DeKalb County court intervened. When court convened the sheriff served a court order declaring a courthouse be built in Sycamore. Afterward, Coltonville eventually suffered the same fate as Brush Point and disappeared from the map. These events seemingly settled the issue of where the courthouse and, in turn, the DeKalb County seat was going to be located.|$|E
5|$|Drainage schemes {{were first}} {{authorised}} {{during the reign}} of Queen Elizabeth I, but from 1632, a group of Adventurers took control of the drainage, in return for which they were granted land. They faced the problem that the outfalls of the River Welland and the River Glen were not sufficiently low to enable proper drainage by gravity, and most schemes included improvement to the rivers. John Perry, an engineer of some repute, who <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> standard for engineering reports in 1727, began work in 1730, and was followed by John Grundy, Sr., a pioneer in applying scientific principles to civil engineering problems. His son, John Grundy, Jr., was another capable engineer, who was retained as a consultant after he resigned as full-time Surveyor of Works.|$|E
5|$|During the season, Smith saw {{action in}} all twelve games, {{including}} ten as a starter, and he amassed 61receptions for 824receiving yards and five touchdowns, 51kickoff returns for 1,309yards and two touchdowns, and eleven rushing attempts for 59yards and one touchdown. His kickoff return yardage surpassed the ACC single-season record that he <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> previous year. Smith finished the season ranked {{sixth in the}} nation in all-purpose yards. He was one of two players, alongside Donald Buckram of UTEP, to record more than 260all-purpose yards in three games. Smith led the team in receptions, receiving yards and return yards. Smith's 2,192all-purpose yards were the second-most ever recorded by an ACC player behind only C. J. Spiller of Clemson.|$|E

5|$|Fearing {{retribution}} {{for their}} actions, the mutineers decided {{to navigate the}} ship toward Spanish waters. One reason the master's life was spared was that Turner could not navigate the ship properly without his help. The Hermione sailed to La Guaira, where they handed the ship over to the Spanish authorities. The mutineers claimed they <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> officers adrift in a small boat, as {{had happened in the}} mutiny on the Bounty some eight years earlier. The Spanish gave the mutineers just 25 dollars each in return, and presented them with the options of joining the Spanish army, heavy labour, or refitting their ship. The Spaniards took Hermione into service under the name Santa Cecilia; her crew included 25 of her former crew, who remained under Spanish guard.|$|E
5|$|When he tweeted a Christmas Eve 2012 {{video of}} himself making 45 of 50 three point shots, Dick Vitale replied 14 minutes later. On April 24, 2013, he posted {{a video of}} himself making 70 of 76 three {{pointers}} in five minutes, and 8 hours later, Stephen Curry challenged him, via Twitter, to a three-point shooting contest. Curry <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> National Basketball Association single-season three pointers made record one week earlier. The following morning ESPN retweeted the video and noted that Stauskas made 46 in a row. A few hours later, when Stauskas woke up, {{he said he would}} look forward to such a contest. Soon Stauskas and Curry's representatives arranged to have a showdown televised on TSN, but the contest would have been in violation of NCAA rules against competition between amateur athletes and professional athletes.|$|E
5|$|According to cricket {{historian}} Bernard Whimpress, {{the early}} signs of a conspiracy against Marsh were raised by a journalist from The Age of Melbourne {{by the name of}} Old Boy. The journalist set a possible agenda by raising a question about Marsh to Crockett on the day before the bowler was called, possibly predisposing the umpire to take action. If Old Boy could be relied on, then observers suspected that Marsh's faster and slower ball were dubious. The reporter did not specify which ball he questioned, except to say that one ball per over was doubtful. The events in Australia occurred against a backdrop of a throwing frenzy in England. A fortnight earlier, the captains of the English county teams had drawn up a list of prohibited bowlers. In Australia, Jim Phillips <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> tone by no-balling Australian Test bowler Ernie Jones. The events in England were seen as a catalyst for a clean-up campaign against dubious bowling actions. Historians regarded Marsh as a prime target due to his Indigenous heritage and his supple wrist action.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the rain}} that had fallen, the drivers went out on track on {{intermediate}} tyres {{at the beginning of}} Q3. On these tyres, Hamilton set the fastest time, followed by Button and Ricciardo. The track dried quickly however, and soon the cars returned to the pit lane to switch to slick tyres. Hülkenberg twice set the fastest time, but was beaten to pole position by Hamilton. Rosberg went faster as well, but lost his second place on the grid to Hülkenberg due to his five-place grid penalty. Vettel went fourth fastest, but was relegated as well, handing third on the grid to Button, who <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> fifth fastest time. Räikkönen, Ricciardo, Valtteri Bottas, Verstappen and Felipe Massa rounded up the top ten. It was Hülkenberg's second front row start of his career, the first having been his pole position at the 2010 Brazilian Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, a {{shoulder}} injury that had limited Zakuani's ability to play the full 90 minutes per game forced him to undergo surgery during the off-season. In his second professional year, Zakuani scored ten goals, equalling the score of striker Fredy Montero for the team lead. He also made six assists. Zakuani was named MLS Player of the Week twice; the first was after recording both goals in a 2–1 win over Colorado, and the second was awarded for both a goal and an assist in a 2–1 victory over Chivas USA. Fans around the league voted the strike against Chivas as the Goal of the Week. Zakuani also won the award for his perfectly timed break past the defensive back line for a one-on-one situation with the goalkeeper while scoring a goal against Toronto FC. He also recorded the fastest-scored goal in club history with a fourth-minute tally against Columbus Crew, beating the previous record he <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> season before. Zakuani was again in the starting line-up for the 2010 U.S. Open Cup final, which Seattle won {{to become the first}} team since 1983 to repeat as Open Cup champions. On 7 November 2010, he scored the Sounders' first ever playoff goal in a 2–1 loss to the Los Angeles Galaxy. He received his green card after the season; this helped the team because MLS limits the number of international players available to each team and receiving permanent resident status exempted him from the cap.|$|E
5|$|On 17 February, Messi {{reached his}} 300th league goal in a 1–3 away win against Sporting de Gijón. A few days later, he scored both goals in Barcelona's 0–2 win against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium, {{in the first}} leg of the 2015–16 UEFA Champions League round of 16, with the second goal being Barcelona's 10,000th in {{official}} competitions. On 17 April, Messi ended a five-match scoring drought with his 500th senior career goal for club and country in Barcelona's 2–1 home loss to Valencia. Messi finished the 2015–16 season by setting up both goals in Barcelona's 2–0 extra time win over Sevilla in the 2016 Copa del Rey Final, at the Vicente Calderón Stadium, on 22 May 2016, as the club celebrated winning the domestic double for the second consecutive season. In total, Messi scored 41 goals and provided 23 assists, as Barcelona's attacking trio managed a Spanish record of 131 goals throughout the season, breaking the record they <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> previous season.|$|E

5|$|On this occasion, both President Tarja Halonen, and the Prime Minister {{said that}} a review was necessary, with Vanhanen {{suggesting}} that {{the time had come}} to question whether or not private persons should be allowed to own handguns, in particular automatic pistols (the kind used by Saari being a semi-automatic). He argued that Finland would only be bringing its laws into closer alignment with gun regulations the EU <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> previous summer. Halonen and Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb said that the government would discuss a divergence in policy between gun control for hunting rifles and handguns. Hunting remains a highly popular sport in Finland, and the Finnish Shooting Sport Federation executive director Risto Aarrekivi said that if people wanted to commit a crime such as this, they would gain access to a handgun regardless of the law. However, he did concede that allowing beginners to buy real firearms as their first guns should be reconsidered.|$|E
5|$|The lawyers {{argued the}} case before the Appellate Division in Brooklyn on October 21, 1927. On December 9, the Appellate Division affirmed the trial court's judgment, 3–2. Albert H. F. Seeger wrote the {{majority}} opinion for the five justices hearing the case, and was joined by Justices William F. Hagarty and William B. Carswell. Seeger {{had been born in}} Stuttgart and came to the United States as a child; he had been elected to the Supreme Court in 1917 and was elevated to the Appellate Division by Governor Al Smith in 1926. Aged 68 at the time of Palsgraf, he could serve only two more years before mandatory retirement. Justice Seeger ruled that the finding of negligence by the jury was supported by the evidence, and speculated that the jury might have found that helping a passenger board a moving train was a negligent act. He wrote that while the set of facts might be novel, the case was no different in principle from well-known court decisions on causation, such as the Squib case, in which an explosive (a squib) was lit and thrown, then was hurled away repeatedly by people not wanting to be hurt until it exploded near the plaintiff, injuring him; his suit against the man who <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> squib in motion was upheld. The majority also focused on the high degree of duty of care that the LIRR owed to Palsgraf, one of its customers.|$|E
