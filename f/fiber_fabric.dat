30|$|Composite or {{laminated}} fabrics offer two advantages. First, they {{eliminate the}} labor involved in sequential upholstering of fabric layers, and second, they prevent exposure of underlying cushioning materials by ‘crack-opening’. When the multi-layered barrier fabric {{is exposed to}} flames, the heat is taken away by the outer coating or layer of the composite fabric, leaving the underlying substrate to which the coating or outer layer is laminated intact and preventing the involvement of underlying cushioning materials in the fire. For example, when a glass <b>fiber</b> <b>fabric</b> coated with polyvinyl chloride is exposed to flames, the polymer does not shrink away from the underlying glass <b>fiber</b> <b>fabric.</b> Instead, it softens and flows into the interstices of the glass <b>fiber</b> <b>fabric.</b> Laminated/coated fabrics eliminate the air space between the layers of barrier fabric and maintain the aesthetics of the exterior fabric while still providing better fire performance ([Schumann & Hartzell 1989]; [Decabromodiphenylether 2005]).|$|E

Firstly, a series of experiments was performed on studying the dynamic moisture transferring procedure and evaluating moisture comfort property of fine denier fiber fabrics in two different environmental conditions, which were the most comfortable condition and an extremely uncomfortable condition for humans. Then, by measuring the real time changes of relative humidity in inner and outer surfaces of test fabrics, fabrics ’ dynamic comprehensive index was obtained to characterize fabrics ’ dynamic moisture comfort property. Finally, grey system theory was introduced to establish prediction models that could describe the relationship between fabric’s static parameters and dynamic comprehensive index.
