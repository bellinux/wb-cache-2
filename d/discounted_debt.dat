40|$|This paper {{addresses}} whether {{government subsidies}} to two Canadian railroads {{built in the}} 1850 s - the Grand Trunk and the Great Western - made economic sense. The historical literature suggests that these railroads, although privately unprofitable, were socially profitable. Through a careful study of company records, {{we find that the}} Great Western was socially profitable and that a relatively small additional subsidy would also have made it privately profitable. But the Grand Trunk was privately unprofitable and probably socially unprofitable as well. The form of the subsidy offered the railroads - loan guarantees - and the consequences, have a depressingly up-to-date ring. While the Great Western received small amounts of limited guarantees, the Grand Trunk received considerable aid. The Grand Trunk was then encouraged to issue large amounts of heavily <b>discounted</b> <b>debt,</b> which contributed to its eventual failure. ...|$|E

40|$|Intercreditor equity {{represents}} one of the main objectives of bankruptcy proceedings. Yet, recent restructurings of sovereign debt suggest that violation of intercreditor equity is common. While existing contractual provisions, and guidelines issued by creditor committees, establish fundamental principles about creditor treatment, they seem to remain too vague to guide debt restructuring processes effectively. The paper focuses on distribution, and argues that lack of clear guidelines for distribution may complicate and delay the resolution process and induce undue uncertainty about the predictability and viability of the restructuring outcome. The paper discusses and proposes parameters which may contribute to establishing explicit principles for the assessment of intercreditor equity in distribution.

We then propose an efficient test for 'strong' fiscal sustainability, using the procedures of Horvath and Watson (1995) for inference when the cointegration vector is pre-specified. We show that regime shifts are pervasive in this context and suggest a Markov switching cointegration approach to test and model fiscal sustainability subject to regime changes.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{modification}} to a baseline sovereign default framework {{that allows us}} to quantify the importance of debt dilution in accounting for the level and volatility of the interest rate spread paid by sovereigns. We measure the effects of debt dilution by comparing the simulations of the baseline model (with debt dilution) with the ones of the modified model without dilution. We calibrate the baseline model to mimic the mean and standard deviation of the spread, as well as the external debt level, the mean debt duration and a measure of default frequency in the data. We find that, even without commitment to future repayment policies and withoutcontingency of sovereign debt, if the sovereign could eliminate debt dilution, the number of default per 100 years decreases from 3. 10 to 0. 42. The mean spread decreases from 7. 38 % to 0. 57 %. The standard deviation of the spread decreases from 2. 45 to 0. 72. Default risk falls in part because of a reduction of the level of sovereign debt (36 % of the face value and of 11 % of the market value). But we show that the most important effect of dilution on default risk results from a shift in the set of government''s borrowing opportunities. Our analysis is also relevant for the study of other credit markets where the debt dilution problem could be present.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the conditions from which inferences {{can be drawn}} regarding sustainability of fiscal stance on the one hand, and a long-run relationship between inflation and budget deficits on the other. These issues have assumed even greater importance {{in the aftermath of}} the collapse of the 1999 stabilization program in February 2001 that was designed to achieve sustainability in debt dynamics and produce a permanent reduction in inflation rates. The first set of findings indicates nonstationarity in the <b>discounted</b> <b>debt</b> to GNP ratio process during 1970 - 2000, implying an unsustainable fiscal outlook. The inference does not imply insolvency, but points to the necessity of a policy change towards fiscal austerity. The second set of findings pertaining to the long-run relationship between the inflation rate, budget deficit, and real output growth suggests two important results. The first of these is that the consolidated budget deficit does not have a long-run component unlike the inflation rate, suggesting that changes in the consolidated budget deficit have no permanent effect on the inflation rate. On the other hand, the PSBR does have a long-run component and is cointegrated with the inflation rate, which implies that the PSBR is a better indicator of fiscal deficits in comparison to the consolidated budget deficit.

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} inter-organizational relationships and organizational development {{that emerged from}} the use of debt for nature swaps (DNS). DNS has been viewed primarily as a financial mechanism that increased the monetary value of conservation donations by converting a country 2 ̆ 7 s <b>discounted</b> <b>debt</b> into funds for environmental protection. ^ I explored aspects of this mechanism that have not been examined previously, focusing on its use as a tool for encouraging relationships among organizations with complementary interests and its potential as a model of inter-organizational governance. To do so, I reviewed and then employed inter-organizational theory to frame the DNS experience. The empirical data includes a general discussion of experiences across the set of countries that participated in these agreements and an in-depth case study of two countries, Bolivia and Costa Rica. Case study methods were used, as well as archival materials, to develop the empirical evidence. ^ The research proposition that initiated this work states that the DNS mechanism generated an adaptive model of transnational environmental governance. I found that this model was adaptive to turbulence associated with the debt crisis by structuring a transnational domain of organizational relationships that together were able to protect biodiversity. This transnational domain includes NGOs and government agencies and extends from local organizations operating on behalf of specific protected areas to international organizations acting to preserve global biodiversity. It exemplifies two recent trends in the environmental field: the internationalization of funding and the localization of action. ^ The findings suggest that DNS is not merely a financial mechanism developed in response to the debt crisis and its national environmental ramifications, but that a transnational model has evolved from it which offers a new approach to environmental planning and governance. In this model, the actors who implement conservation programs also participate in the development of policy and planning. In addition to the introduction and dissemination of this transnational model of governance, the DNS legacy includes the diffusion of the concept of using debt for environmental purposes, the establishment of endowments and environmental trust funds, and the development of capacity among NGOs and government agencies to achieve conservation goals. ...|$|E

Higher sovereign <b>debt</b> <b>discounts</b> deteriorated the fiscal position of the Spanish government.

We construct a DSGE model with balance-sheet-constrained financial intermediaries that finance private loans to the real economy, as well as sovereign debt subject to sovereign default risk. We calibrate the model to Spanish data, and find that our model is capable of matching the developments in the sovereign bond market in Spain in May/June 2012 quite well.

This suggests that runs on the debt of a single borrower (such as the government) can be eliminated, and that self-fulfilling features are more plausible when articulated in a context in which externalities among many decentralized borrowers allow for economy-wide debt runs to occur.

Next, situations are considered in which spatial inhomogeneity of the drift velocity can cause binomial jump probabilities to become negative.

Finally, to mimic {{the effect of a}} drift-velocity divergence which prevents interest rates from becoming negative, Neumann boundary conditions are applied in the Vasicek model.

40|$|We analyse the {{poisonous}} interaction between bank rescues, financial fragility and sovereign <b>debt</b> <b>discounts.</b> In our model balance sheet constrained financial intermediaries finance both capital expenditure of intermediate goods producers and government deficits. The financial intermediaries face {{the risk of}} a (partial) default of the government on its debt obligations. We analyse the impact of a financial crisis, first under full government credibility and then with an endogenous sovereign <b>debt</b> <b>discount.</b> We introduce long term government debt, which gives rise to the possibility of capital losses on bank balance sheets. The negative feedback effects from falling bond prices on the economy are shown to increase with the average duration of the government bonds, as higher interest rates on new debt lead to capital losses on banks' holding of existing long term (government) debt. The associated increase in credit tightness leads to a negative amplification effect, significantly increasing output losses and declines in investment after a financial crisis. We introduce sovereign default risk through the existence of a maximum sustainable level of debt, derived from the maximum level of taxation that is politically feasible. When close to this limit, sovereign discounts emerge reflecting potential defaults on debt, creating a strong link between sovereign default risk and financial fragility emerges. A debt-financed recapitalisation of the financial intermediaries causes bond prices to drop triggering capital losses at the bank under intervention. This mechanism shows the limits to conventional bank bail-outs in countries with fragile public creditworthiness, limits that became very visible during the Great Recession in Southern Europe...|$|R
40|$|While the {{relationship}} between volatility and credit risk is central {{to much of the}} literature on finance and banking, it has been largely neglected in empirical macro studies on sovereign defaults. This paper presents new econometric estimates for a panel of 25 emerging market countries over 1970 - 2001, breaking down aggregate volatility into its external and domestic policy components. We find that countries with historically higher macroeconomic volatility are more prone to default, and particularly so if part of this volatility is policy-induced. Reducing policy volatility thus appears to be key to improving a country''s credit standing.

50|$|A small {{business}} precursor of Grupo Corripio {{was established in}} 1917 when Ramón Corripio arrived {{for the first time}} in the Dominican Republic from Spain. Ramón received further support when his brother Manuel Corripio (1908-2005) arrived in 1921. They established the business with a modest sum of RD$3,000 pesos; they had lost much of their initial investment after the Hurricane San Zenón in 1930. In the wake of the tragedy the Canadian Royal Bank offered to <b>discount</b> its clients <b>debt</b> by 50%. However, the Corripio brothers, who had incurred debt to the bank, preferred settling their commitments. This decision helped establish a solid reputation and opened new doors and sources for financing.|$|R
