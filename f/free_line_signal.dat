The presence of spectral {{lines in the}} power spectral density (PSD) may limit the maximum transmission power in order to comply with UWB regulations, thus affecting the system performance. Although previous works have shown the advantages of IR-UWB over fiber (UWBoF) implementations, the topic of spectral line suppression in PSD in such systems has not been entirely addressed. This letter proposes a simple IR-UWBoF system using spectral <b>line</b> <b>free</b> convolutional codes (SLF-CCs) to address this topic. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed system offers improved PSD characteristics compared to conventional IR-UWBoF implementations. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the proposed system is able to deliver spectral <b>line</b> <b>free</b> IR-UWB <b>signals</b> over single-mode fibers up to 30 k...|$|R
50|$|<b>Line</b> <b>signaling</b> is a {{class of}} {{telecommunications}} <b>signaling</b> protocols. <b>Line</b> <b>signaling</b> is responsible for off-hook, ringing signal, answer, ground start, on-hook unidirectional supervision messaging in each direction from calling party to called party and vice versa. After an off-hook, <b>line</b> <b>signaling</b> initiates register signaling to accomplish the exchange of telephone numbers of called party and in more modern line-signaling protocols, the calling party as well. While register <b>signaling</b> occurs, <b>line</b> <b>signaling</b> remains quiescent unless the calling party goes on-hook or an abnormal cessation of the call occurs, such as due to equipment malfunction or shutdown or due to network outage upstream in that call-attempt's series of spanned trunks.|$|R

Those that use only the A bit, strongly resemble the analog electrical R2 <b>line</b> <b>signalling,</b> where each signal is a timed pulse that differs by length of time that the pulse is in the high voltage (i.e., one-valued bit) state before returning to the untimed resting voltage state (i.e., zero-valued bit). Those that use multiple bits to represent each signal usually are stateful in that time of exhibition of that bit pattern typically plays no role in conveying meaning.|$|R
