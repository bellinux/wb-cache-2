He later recalled, [...] "I thought people in those conditions would have very, very, reduced language—they wouldn't be really a verbal society any more, and I think we're heading towards that. Television is mainly responsible for it, the fact that people are now conditioned to image. The pictures they see on television screens more and more dominate their thinking, as far as people do a lot of thinking, and if you had a verbally reduced society, you would <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of language—possibly—that you did get in the play".|$|E

2500|$|At this time, {{managers}} were relatively {{rare in the}} pro wrestling world—WWWF had only two others. However, a promising new wrestler, Oscar [...] "Crusher" [...] Verdu, had just recently emigrated from Spain. His in-ring capabilities were hampered by a limited command of English, and Albano was assigned to be his mouthpiece. Albano emphasized Verdu's physique and insisted {{that he had never}} been taken off his feet during a match. [...] To rile up audiences, he also engaged in ethnic slurs, which were then a more common part of WWWF banter; Albano promised that Verdu would stomp on [...] "that Italian" [...] (Sammartino); the fact that Albano was known to be Italian himself only heightened the audience's reaction. Sammartino later said, [...] "They wanted to see me beat the hell out of Verdu to make Albano a liar. [...] He could <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of heat that nobody else could." [...] The result was a Madison Square Garden sellout when Verdu faced Sammartino in June 1970, the first for the company in five years and a then-record gate for a wrestling event in that arena. The record lasted only a month, when a rematch brought in over $85,000 in ticket receipts. [...] After losing that match, Verdu cycled out of the WWWF rotation, but Albano remained as the top heel manager for the next 15 years.|$|E
