The degree of cholesterol reduction will also depend upon the particular strain of β-glucan and its composite <b>food</b> <b>matrix.</b> To achieve an observable reduction, β-glucans must range between a molecular weight of 26.8 and 3000 kD. Although more viscous β-glucans result in a more viscous solution of intestinal digesta and thus more cholesterol uptake, after a certain molecular weight, β-glucans become less soluble and thus contribute less to solution viscosity. The intake of β-glucan in liquid form generally results in greater solubilization and oat β-glucan is more effective at lowering cholesterol in juices than in hard foods like bread and cookies. Despite the recognized impact of viscosity on serum cholesterol levels, no current data exists comparing internal solution viscosity and serum cholesterol.|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{dried fruit}} {{have a low}} to {{moderate}} Glycemic Index (GI) - {{a measure of how}} a food affects blood sugar levels. GI measures an individual's response to eating a carbohydrate-containing food (usually 50 grams of available carbohydrates) compared to the individual's response to the same amount of carbohydrates from either white bread or glucose. Carbohydrate containing foods are classified as high (above 70), moderate (56-69), or low (0-55) GI. Foods with high fiber content generally have a low GI. However, other factors also contribute to a food's glycemic response, such as the type of carbohydrate or sugar present, the physical characteristic of the <b>food</b> <b>matrix</b> and the presence of organic acids. All studies assessing the GI of dried fruit show that they are low to moderate GI foods and that the insulin response is proportional to their GI. Factors thought to contribute to this glycemic response include the viscous texture of dried fruits when chewed; their whole food matrix; the presence of phenolic compounds and organic acids and the type of sugar present (about 50% fructose in most traditional dried fruit).|$|E

40|$|There {{is little}} {{knowledge}} about the factors that determine the allergenicity of food proteins. One aspect {{that remains to be}} elucidated is the effect of the <b>food</b> <b>matrix</b> on immune responses to food proteins. To study the intrinsic immunogenicity of allergens and the influence of the <b>food</b> <b>matrix,</b> purified peanut allergens (Ara h 1, Ara h 2, Ara h 3 or Ara h 6) and a whole peanut extract (PE) were tested in the popliteal lymph node assay (PLNA) and in an oral model of peanut hypersensitivity. In the PLNA, peanut proteins were injected into the hind footpad of BALB/ c mice; in the oral exposure experiments C 3 H/HeOuJ mice were gavaged weekly with PE or allergens in the presence of cholera toxin (CT). Upon footpad injection, none of the allergens induced significant immune activation. In contrast, PE induced an increase in cell number, cytokine production, and activation of antigen-presenting cells. Furthermore, the presence of a <b>food</b> <b>matrix</b> enhanced the immune response to the individual allergens. Oral exposure to the purified allergens in the presence of CT induced specific IgE responses, irrespective of the presence of a <b>food</b> <b>matrix.</b> These results suggest that purified peanut allergens possess little intrinsic immune-stimulating capacity in contrast to a whole PE. Moreover, the data indicate that the <b>food</b> <b>matrix</b> can influence responses to individual proteins and, therefore, the <b>food</b> <b>matrix</b> {{must be taken into account}} when developing models for allergenic potential assessment. © The Author 2005.

40|$|Aroma {{perception}} {{is an important}} factor driving food acceptance. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are released from the <b>food</b> <b>matrix</b> and then reach the receptors located in the nasal cavity, leading to their perception. These steps are closely dependent on the physicochemical properties of the volatile compounds and the <b>food</b> <b>matrix,</b> but also on human physiology. Among the different physiological parameters involved, the literature reports that saliva has various effects on VOCs and therefore appears as a major actor impacting the perception of aroma. This article reviews how saliva takes part in aroma release, considering both in vitro and in vivo approaches, and how it may affect perception. It describes the direct mechanisms (molecular interactions, enzymatic conversion, salting-out effect, dilution) involving salivary components (salts, proteins including enzymes, microbiota) that can modify the release of aroma compounds. It also considers the indirect impact of saliva, such as changes of aroma diffusion through modification of the physicochemical properties of the <b>food</b> <b>matrix...</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Since the <b>food</b> <b>matrix</b> determines β-carotene {{availability}} for intestinal absorption, <b>food</b> <b>matrix</b> {{effects on}} the bioaccessibility of β-carotene from two diets were investigated in vitro and compared with in vivo data. The “mixed diet” consisted of β-carotene-rich vegetables, and the “oil diet ” contained β-carotene-low vegetables with supplemental β-carotene. The application of extrinsically labeled β-carotene was also investigated. The bioaccessibility of β-carotene was 28 μg/ 100 μg β-carotene from the mixed diet and 53 μg/ 100 μg β-carotene from the oil diet. This ratio of 1. 9 : 1 was consistent with in vivo data, where the apparent absorption was 1. 9 -fold higher in the oil diet than in the mixed diet. The labeled β-carotene was not equally distributed over time. In conclusion, the <b>food</b> <b>matrix</b> effects on bioaccessibility of β-carotene could be measured using an in vitro model and were consistent with in vivo data.

In this context, EURLCPS is annually organizing Inter-Laboratory Proficiency Testing Trials (ILPT) to evaluate the competency of the European countries’ National Reference Laboratories (NRLs) to analyse SE content in <b>food</b> <b>matrices.</b> A total of 31 NRLs representing 93 % of European countries participated in these ILPTs. Eight <b>food</b> <b>matrices</b> were used for ILPT over the period 2013 – 2015, including cheese, freeze-dried cheese, tuna, mackerel, roasted chicken, ready-to-eat food, milk, and pastry. Food samples were spiked with four SE types (i. e., SEA, SEC, SED, and SEE) at various concentrations. Homogeneity and stability studies showed that ILPT samples were both homogeneous and stable. The analysis of results obtained by participants for a total of 155 blank and 620 contaminated samples allowed for evaluation of trueness (> 98 %) and specificity (100 %) of ESM. Further to the validation study of ESM carried out in 2011, these three ILPTs allowed for the assessment of the proficiency of the NRL network and the performance of ESM on a large variety of <b>food</b> <b>matrices</b> and samples.

40|$|The {{analysis}} and quantification of (galacto) oligosaccharides from <b>food</b> <b>matrices</b> demands both a reproducible extraction method {{as well as}} a sensitive and accurate analytical method. Three typical matrices, namely, infant formula, fruit juice, and a maltodextrin-rich preparation, to which a commercial galactooligosaccharide mixture was added in a product concentration range from 1. 25 to 30 %, served as model substrates. Solid-phase extraction on graphitized carbon material upon enzymatic amyloglucosidase pretreatment enabled a good recovery and a selective purification of the different galactooligosaccharide structures from the exceeding amounts of particularly lactose and maltodextrins.

Apart from being indispensable for the growth and functional development of the brain in infants {{and the maintenance of}} normal brain functions in adults, the intake of DHA would participate in preventing cardiovascular diseases, reducing the risk of suffering from metabolic syndrome and preventing the promotion and progression of some types of cancer. Due to its vital importance, several studies have been conducted in order to establish the most effective form of DHA in terms of absorption, bioavailability and ultimately its incorporation and assimilation into the different human tissues (TAG, PL or NEFA for instance). However, the study of its interaction with the <b>food</b> <b>matrix</b> still remains poorly studied despite DHA is most of the time ingested as part of complex food matrices.

A rapid and reliable analysis of aflatoxins in food is crucial. In this study, we generated a broad-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) 3 C 10 against aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1). The MAb 3 C 10 binds specifically to AFB 1 and AFM 1 and has a IC 50 of 0. 13 g L- 1 for AFB 1 and 0. 16 g L- 1 for AFM 1. Furthermore, the MAb showed high cross-reactivity to AFB 2, AFG 1, and AFG 2. To enable simultaneous AFB 1 and AFM 1 detection in different <b>food</b> <b>matrices,</b> an indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (icELISA) based on MAb 3 C 10 has been developed and optimized. In addition, the extraction methods of different <b>food</b> <b>matrices</b> (peanut, corn, soybean, wheat flour, rice, soy sauce, vinegar, wine, raw milk, pure milk, skimmed milk, and yogurt) were established. The average recovery ranged from 73 to 121 %, with relative sta ndard deviation values less than 15 %.

40|$|Upon {{analysis}} of chemically complex <b>food</b> <b>matrices</b> {{a forest of}} peaks {{is likely to be}} found. Identification of these peaks and concurrent determination of the toxicological relevance upon exposure is very time consuming, expensive and often requires animal studies. Recently, a safety assessment framework based on the Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) was published to assess the safety of chemically complex matrices more efficiently. In this safety assessment framework, the toxicological relevance of exposure to unidentified substances in chemically complex <b>food</b> <b>matrices</b> can be related to the Cramer class III TTC threshold, currently set at 90. μg/day. However, possible additive or synergistic effects of combined exposure is not covered. The current evaluation describes the relevance of combined low dose exposure to unidentified substances in chemically complex <b>food</b> <b>matrices.</b> It is concluded that to some extent cumulative effects at exposure levels for each substance at or below the Cramer class III TTC threshold, being present in a complex mixture including food, might occur. However the health relevance of possible cumulative effects at this dose level is considered to be that low that a need for a correction factor to cover possible cumulative effects is very low to absent. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Betalains are {{considered}} to be bioactive dietary phytochemicals. The stability of betacyanins and betaxanthins from either fresh foods or manufactured products of cactus pear fruit (Opuntia ficus indica L. Mill. cv. Gialla and Rossa) and red beet (Beta vulgaris L. ssp. vulgaris) was assessed in a simulated oral, gastric, and small intestinal digestion and compared with the digestive stability of purified pigments. A minor loss of indicaxanthin, at the gastric-like environment only, and a decrease of vulgaxanthin I through all digestion steps were observed, which was not affected by <b>food</b> <b>matrix.</b> In contrast, <b>food</b> <b>matrix</b> prevented decay of betanin and isobetanin at the gastric-like environment. Loss of betacyanins, either purified or food-derived, was observed during the small intestinal phase of digestion. Betalamic acid accumulated after digestive degradation of purified pigments, but not of food betalains. Betaxanthins were wholly soluble in the aqueous (bioaccessible) fraction after ultracentrifugation of the postintestinal (PI) digesta, whereas release of betacyanins from the matrix was incomplete. PI digesta inhibited dose-dependently the oxidation of methyl linoleate in methanol, an effect not correlated with the betalain content. The data suggest that digestive stability controls bioaccessibility of dietary betaxanthins, whereas additional factors, relevant to the <b>food</b> <b>matrix</b> and style of processing, affect betacyanin bioaccessibility...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: To {{develop a}} {{staining}} method for specific detection of metabolically active (viable) cells in biofilms of the foodborne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni. METHODS AND RESULTS: Conversion of 2, 3, 5 triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) to insoluble, red 1, 3, 5 -triphenylformazan (TPF) {{was dependent on}} metabolic activity of Camp. jejuni. When used with chicken juice, TTC staining allowed quantification of Camp. jejuni biofilm levels, whereas the commonly used dye, crystal violet, gave high levels of nonspecific staining of <b>food</b> <b>matrix</b> components (chicken juice). The assay was optimized to allow for monitoring of biofilm levels and adapted to monitor levels of Camp. jejuni in broth media. CONCLUSIONS: Staining with TTC allows for the quantification of metabolically active Camp. jejuni and thus allows for quantification of viable cells in biofilms and food matrices. The TTC staining method {{can be adapted to}} quantify bacterial cell concentration in a <b>food</b> <b>matrix</b> model, where the accepted method of A 600 measurement is not suitable due to interference by components of the <b>food</b> <b>matrix.</b> SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: 2, 3, 5 Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining is a low-cost technique suitable for use in biofilm analysis, allowing rapid and simple imaging of metabolically active cells and increasing the methods available for biofilm assessment and quantification...|$|E

40|$|Nanoparticles (NPs) {{have been}} widely {{utilized}} in the food industry as additives with their beneficial characteristics, such as improving sensory property and processing suitability, enhancing functional and nutritional values, and extending shelf-life of foods. Silica is used as an anti-caking agent to improve flow property of powered ingredients and as a carrier for flavors or active compounds in food. Along with the rapid development of nanotechnology, the sizes of silica fall into nanoscale, thereby raising concerns about the potential toxicity of nano-sized silica materials. There {{have been a number}} of studies carried out to investigate possible adverse effects of NPs on the gastrointestinal tract. The interactions between NPs and surrounding <b>food</b> <b>matrices</b> should be also taken into account since the interactions can affect their bioavailability, efficacy, and toxicity. In the present study, we investigated the interactions between food additive silica NPs and <b>food</b> <b>matrices,</b> such as saccharides, proteins, lipids, and minerals. Quantitative analysis was performed to determine food component-NP corona using HPLC, fluorescence quenching, GC-MS, and ICP-AES. The results demonstrate that zeta potential and hydrodynamic radius of silica NPs changed in the presence of all <b>food</b> <b>matrices,</b> but their solubility was not affected. However, quantitative analysis on the interactions revealed that a small portion of <b>food</b> <b>matrices</b> interacted with silica NPs and the interactions were highly dependent on the type of food component. Moreover, minor nutrients could also affect the interactions, as evidenced by higher NP interaction with honey rather than with a simple sugar mixture containing an equivalent amount of fructose, glucose, sucrose, and maltose. These findings provide fundamental information to extend our understanding about the interactions between silica NPs and food components and to predict the interaction effect on the safety aspects of food-grade NPs...|$|R

Only small portions of berries are consumed fresh, most of their intake coming from processed foods, such as juices. Seven techniques were used to measure antioxidant capacity and antioxidant compounds of 10 juices. This yielded a large disparity of results. No single test, even the most popular ORAC assay, is able to compare the antioxidant capacity of similar <b>food</b> <b>matrix</b> such as blackcurrant juices. By combining tests from a large battery of « antioxidant » assays, it is possible to improve the discrimination of a <b>food</b> <b>matrix</b> by establishing a Global Antioxidant Score (GAS) which correlates well with graphical representations like Chernoff faces or stars. The latter approaches may help food industry managers and authorities to compare their « antioxidant » products with those existing on the market...|$|E
