The temperature of the hot star results 80, 000 K as for a white dwarf. We find that the shock velocity in the NE jet increased between 1983 and 1989. The spectral evolution between 1989 and 1991 of the SW jet indicates that a larger contribution from low density-velocity matter affects the 1991 spectra. The evolution of the UV spectra from 8 / 11 / 1980 to 26 / 5 / 1991 in the HII region indicates that the reverse shock is actually a standing shock. The results obtained by modelling the line spectra are cross-checked by the fit of the continuum SED. It is found that a black-body temperature of 2800 K reproduces the radiation from the red giant. A black-body emission component corresponding to 1000 K is emitted by dust in the surrounding of the red giant. Model calculations confirm that the radio emission is of thermal origin.

We first generalize our previous analytical results by taking into consideration relativistic motion and relativistic equation of states for the three components namely the inner beam, the sheet or envelope and the ambient medium, and derive the dispersion relation for the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The ultrarelativistic limit of paper I {{as well as the}} nonrelativistic limit for both the equations of state and the <b>jet</b> <b>bulk</b> speed can be deduced. Exploring a wider range of parameters, we find evidence for two main types of instability modes, with mode crossing and interaction between modes. These two modes correspond to the excitation of sound waves in the beam and in the envelope which can both act as a resonant wave guide. As a result, the addition of an inner beam inside a jet can strongly enhance the linear growth of its Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The stratified jet scenario appears quite relevant to give account for the complex morphology and velocity fields now observed in a few jets such as in M 87, where various layers with respect to the jet axis are clearly visible.

We find that the observed optical/near-IR synchrotron emission of the hotspots can be explained even if the radiating relativistic electrons were accelerated exclusively within the nuclear region, provided the energy losses incurred by the electrons during their transport down the jet are dominated by inverse Compton upscatterings of the cosmic microwave background photons. Under this circumstance, in-situ acceleration of relativistic electrons inside the hotspots or lobes is not found to be mandated by their reported optical/near-infrared detections.

Precession changes the orientation of the emission source (either disc or jet) relative to the observer. This leads to emission modulation due to an anisotropic emission pattern of the source or orientation-dependent amount of absorbing medium along the line of sight or both. We consider, in particular, anisotropy patterns of blackbody-type emission, thermal Comptonization in slab geometry, jet/outflow beaming, and absorption in a coronal-type medium above the disc. We then fit these models to the data from the RXTE/ASM, CGRO/BATSE, and the Ryle and Green Bank radio telescopes, and find relatively small best-fit angles between the precession and orbital planes, ~ 10 - 20 degrees.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{detailed}} numerical investigation of the hypothesis that a rotation of astrophysical jets {{can be caused by}} magnetohydrodynamic shocks in a helical magnetic field. Shock compression of the helical magnetic field results in a toroidal Lorentz force component which will accelerate the jet material in toroidal direction. This process transforms magnetic angular momentum (magnetic stress) carried along the jet into kinetic angular momentum (rotation). The mechanism proposed here only works in a helical magnetic field configuration. We demonstrate the feasibility of this mechanism by axisymmetric MHD simulations in 1. 5 D and 2. 5 D using the PLUTO code. In our setup the jet is injected into the ambient gas with zero kinetic angular momentum (no rotation). Different dynamical parameters for jet propagation are applied such as the jet internal Alfvén Mach number and fast magnetosonic Mach number, the density contrast of jet to ambient medium, or the external sonic Mach number of the jet. The mechanism we suggest should work for a variety of jet applications, e. g. protostellar or extragalactic jets, and internal jet shocks (jet knots) or external shocks between the jet and ambient gas (entrainment).

This has been performed using parameter scans inside a range of pedestal temperatures and densities to scope different experimentally expected ELM energies. On the one hand, we observe optimistic results, with smoothing of the heat flux due to the Larmor gyration on the protruding side of the lamella which sees the direct parallel flux—the deposited power tends to be lower than the nominal value expected from geometric magnetic field line impact over a distance smaller than 2 Larmor radii, a finding which is always valid during ELMs for such a geometry. On the other hand, the fraction of the flux not reaching the directly wetted side is transferred and spread to the top surface of the lamella.

The jets are `lit up' by shock fronts traveling along the jets during outbursts. The observed comparatively flat decay light curves combined with gradually steepening spectral slopes are explained by a superposition of the radiation of the aging relativistic particle population left behind by the shocks. This scenario is the low energy, time-resolved equivalent to the internal shock model for GRBs. We show that this model predicts energy contents of the radiating plasma similar to the plasmon model. At the same time, the jet model relaxes the severe requirements on the central source in terms of the rate at which this energy must be supplied to the jet. Observations of `mini-bursts' with flat spectral slopes and of infrared emission far from the source centre suggest two different states of jet ejections: (i) A `mini-burst' mode with relatively stable jet production and weak radio emission with flat spectra and (ii) an outburst mode with strong variations in the <b>jet</b> <b>bulk</b> velocities coupled with strong radio emission with steeper spectra.

The conventionally adopted parameter space for the fundamental variables, namely, the hotspot magnetic field, radio source orientation angle relative to the line-of-sight and the bulk speed of the jet plasma, is considered. We find that the observed optical/near-IR synchrotron emission of the hotspots can be explained even if the radiating relativistic electrons were accelerated exclusively within the nuclear region, provided the energy losses incurred by the electrons during their transport down the jet are dominated by inverse Compton upscatterings of the cosmic microwave background photons. Under this circumstance, in-situ acceleration of relativistic electrons inside the hotspots or lobes is not found to be mandated by their reported optical/nearinfrared detections.

40|$|The γ-ray bright blazar CTA 102 is studied using imaging (new 15 GHz and archival 43 GHz Very Long Baseline Array, VLBA data) {{and time}} {{variable}} optical flux density, polarization degree and electric vector position angle (EVPA) spanning between 2015 June 1 and 2016 October 1, covering a prominent γ-ray flare during 2016 January. The pc-scale jet indicates expansion with oscillatory features upto 17 mas. Component proper motions {{are in the}} range 0. 04 - 0. 33 mas/yr with acceleration upto 1. 2 mas followed by a slowing down beyond 1. 5 mas. A <b>jet</b> <b>bulk</b> Lorentz factor ≥ 17. 5, position angle of 128. 3 degrees, inclination angle ≤ 6. 6 degrees and intrinsic half opening angle ≤ 1. 8 degrees are derived from the VLBA data. These inferences are employed in a helical jet model to infer long term variability in flux density, polarization degree, EVPA and a rotation of the Stokes Q and U parameters. A core distance of r_ core, 43 GHz = 22. 9 pc, and a magnetic field strength at 1 pc and the core location of 1. 57 G and 0. 07 G respectively are inferred using the core shift method. The study is useful in the context of estimating jet parameters and in offering clues to distinguish mechanisms responsible for variability over different timescales.

40|$|We {{present the}} {{detection}} of the compact radio structures of 14 radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS 1) galaxies from Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations at 5 GHz performed in 2013. While 50 % {{of the sources of}} our sample show a compact core only, the remaining 50 % exhibit a core-jet structure. The measured brightness temperatures of the cores range from 10 (8. 4) to 10 (11. 4) K with a median value of 10 (10. 1) K, indicating that the radio emission is from non-thermal jets, and that, likely, most sources are not strongly beamed, thus implying a low jet speed in these radio-loud NLS 1 galaxies. In combination with archival data taken at multiple frequencies, we find that seven sources show flat or even inverted radio spectra, while steep spectra are revealed in the remaining seven objects. Although all of these sources are very radio-loud with R > 100, their jet properties are diverse in terms of their milliarcsecond (mas) scale (parsec scale) morphology and their overall radio spectral shape. The evidence for slow jet speeds (i. e., less relativistic jets), in combination with the low kinetic/radio power, may offer an explanation for the compact VLBA radio structure in most sources. The mildly relativistic jets in these high accretion rate systems are consistent with a scenario where jets are accelerated from the hot corona above the disk by the magnetic field and the radiation force of the accretion disk. Alternatively, a low <b>jet</b> <b>bulk</b> velocity can be explained by low spin in the Blandford-Znajek mechanism...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} 5 - 43 GHz VLBA {{study of the}} blazar 3 C 273 initiated after an onset of a strong γ-ray flare in this source. We have analyzed the kinematics of new-born components, light curves, and position of the apparent core to pinpoint {{the location of the}} γ-ray emission. Estimated location of the γ-ray emission zone is close to the jet apex, 2 pc to 7 pc upstream from the observed 7 mm core. This is supported by ejection of a new component. The apparent core position was found to be inversely proportional to frequency. The brightness temperature in the 7 mm core reached values up to at least 10 ^ 13 K during the flare. This supports the dominance of particle energy density over that of magnetic field in the 7 mm core. Particle density increased during the radio flare at the apparent jet base, affecting synchrotron opacity. This manifested itself as an apparent core shuttle along the jet during the 7 mm flare. It is also shown that a region where optical depth decreases from τ∼ 1 to τ<< 1 spans over several parsecs along the <b>jet.</b> The <b>jet</b> <b>bulk</b> flow speed estimated at the level of 12 c on the basis of time lags between 7 mm light curves of stationary jet features is 1. 5 times higher than that derived from VLBI apparent kinematics analysis.

40|$|Rapid and {{luminous}} flares of non-thermal radiation {{observed in}} blazars require an efficient mechanism of energy dissipation and particle acceleration in relativistic active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets. Particle acceleration in relativistic magnetic reconnection is being actively studied by kinetic numerical simulations. Relativistic reconnection produces hard power-law electron energy distributions N (γ) ∝ γ − p exp (− γ / γ max) with index p → 1 and exponential cut-off Lorentz factor γ max ∼ σ in {{the limit of}} magnetization σ = B 2 / (4 π w) ≫ 1 (where w is the relativistic enthalpy density). Reconnection in electron-proton plasma can additionally boost γ max by the mass ratio m p / m e. Hence, in order to accelerate particles to γ max ∼ 10 6 in the case of BL Lacs, reconnection should proceed in plasma of very high magnetization σ max ≳ 10 3. On the other hand, moderate mean jet magnetization values are required for magnetic bulk acceleration of relativistic jets, σ mean ∼ Γ j ≲ 20 (where Γ j is the <b>jet</b> <b>bulk</b> Lorentz factor). I propose that the systematic dependence of γ max on blazar luminosity class—the blazar sequence—may result from a systematic trend in σ max due to homogeneous loading of leptons by pair creation regulated by the energy density of high-energy external radiation fields. At the same time, relativistic AGN jets should be highly inhomogeneous due to filamentary loading of protons, which should determine the value of σ mean roughly independently of the blazar class...|$|R
40|$|Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) are {{the most}} {{powerful}} relativistic jets seen from supermassive black holes (BHs) accreting via a radiatively efficient thin disc. Their high energy emission is well modelled by highly relativistic electrons in the jet Compton upscattering an external source of seed photons, primarily from the broad line region. Strong Doppler boosting by the <b>jet</b> <b>bulk</b> motion makes these FSRQs readily detectable by the Fermi Large Area Telescope. We combine jet spectral models with scaling relations for the jet physical parameters {{as a function of}} mass and accretion rate. This does not match well to the Gamma-ray loud Narrow Line Seyfert 1 s, assuming their low BH masses are reliable, but is able to predict much of the spectral evolution observed along the Blazar sequence. We use these models in conjunction with cosmological simulations of efficiently accreting BH number densities, and find that they overpredict the observed number of FSRQs by 2 orders of magnitude if all of these objects produce a FSRQ jet. We can better reproduce the observed numbers if jets are only produced by high spin BHs and BH spin is built from chaotically aligned accretion episodes so that high spin BHs are rare. However, this does not reproduce the observed redshift and mass accretion rate distributions of the FSRQs. This may indicate a redshift dependence in accretion mode, with sustained alignment accretion episodes being more prevalent at higher redshift, or that there is some other trigger for FSRQ jets.
