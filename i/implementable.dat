25|$|Leonardo da Vinci is {{frequently}} credited with introducing {{the idea of}} contact lenses in his 1508 Codex of the eye, Manual D, wherein he described a method of directly altering corneal power by either submerging the head {{in a bowl of}} water or wearing a water-filled glass hemisphere over the eye. Neither idea was practically <b>implementable</b> in da Vinci's time. He did not suggest his idea be used for correcting vision, as he was more interested in learning about the mechanisms of accommodation of the eye.|$|E
25|$|Common Lisp is a {{successor}} to MacLisp. The primary influences were Lisp Machine Lisp, MacLisp, NIL, S-1 Lisp, Spice Lisp, and Scheme. It has many {{of the features of}} Lisp Machine Lisp (a large Lisp dialect used to program Lisp Machines), but was designed to be efficiently <b>implementable</b> on any personal computer or workstation. Common Lisp has a large language standard including many built-in data types, functions, macros and other language elements, as well as an object system (Common Lisp Object System). Common Lisp also borrowed certain features from Scheme such as lexical scoping and lexical closures.|$|E
25|$|While some fields {{mentioned}} as branches of SENS are broadly {{supported by the}} medical research community, e.g., stem cell research (RepleniSENS), anti-Alzheimers research (AmyloSENS) and oncogenomics (OncoSENS), the SENS programme {{as a whole has}} been a highly controversial proposal, with many critics arguing that the SENS agenda is fanciful and the highly complicated biomedical phenomena involved in the aging process contain too many unknowns for SENS to be fully <b>implementable</b> in the foreseeable future. Cancer may well deserve special attention as an aging-associated disease (OncoSENS), but the SENS claim that nuclear DNA damage only matters for aging because of cancer has been challenged in the literature as well as by material in the article DNA damage theory of aging.|$|E
500|$|An early {{result in}} this {{direction}} was provided by [...] using the cell probe model of computation (an artificial model in which the complexity of an algorithm is measured only {{by the number of}} memory accesses it performs). Building on their work, [...] described two data structures, the Q-heap and the atomic heap, that are <b>implementable</b> on a random access machine. The Q-heap is a bit-parallel version of a binary trie, and allows both priority queue operations and successor and predecessor queries to be performed in constant time for sets of [...] items, where [...] is the size of the precomputed tables needed to implement the data structure. The atomic heap is a B-tree in which each tree node is represented as a Q-heap; it allows constant time priority queue operations (and therefore sorting) for sets of [...] items.|$|E

2500|$|Gladwell's {{theories}} of crime were {{heavily influenced by}} the [...] "broken windows theory" [...] of policing, and Gladwell is credited for packaging and popularizing the theory {{in a way that}} was <b>implementable</b> in New York City. Gladwell's theoretical implementation bears a striking resemblance to the [...] "stop-and-frisk" [...] policies of the NYPD. However, in the decade and a half since its publication, The Tipping Point and Gladwell have both come under fire for the tenuous link between [...] "broken windows" [...] and New York City's drop in violent crime. During a 2013 interview with BBC journalist Jon Ronson for The Culture Show, Gladwell admitted that he was [...] "too in love with the broken-windows notion". He went on to say that he was [...] "so enamored by the metaphorical simplicity of that idea that I overstated its importance".|$|E
2500|$|Consider {{the total}} returns [...] for each period [...] [...] This forms a vector-valued random process [...] At time period , we can {{rebalance}} the portfolio by specifying the amounts [...] {{invested in the}} respective assets. At that time the returns {{in the first period}} have been realized so it is reasonable to use this information in the rebalancing decision. Thus, the second-stage decisions, at time , are actually functions of realization of the random vector , i.e., [...] Similarly, at time [...] the decision [...] is a function [...] of the available information given by [...] the history of the random process up to time [...] A sequence of functions , , with [...] being constant, defines an <b>implementable</b> policy of the decision process.

50|$|Data {{refinement}} is used {{to convert}} an abstract data model (in terms of sets for example) into <b>implementable</b> data structures (such as arrays). Operation refinement converts a specification of an operation on a system into an <b>implementable</b> program (e.g., a procedure). The postcondition can be strengthened and/or the precondition weakened in this process. This reduces any nondeterminism in the specification, typically to a completely deterministic implementation.|$|E
