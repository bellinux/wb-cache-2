Today the international road and the railway from West Europe through Belgrade and Sofia to Istanbul are passing through the town. The Belovo paper mill produces toilet paper and other <b>disposable</b> <b>paper</b> <b>products.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{economic}} {{prosperity of the}} Roaring Twenties boosted demand for <b>disposable</b> <b>paper</b> <b>products</b> even higher, further spurring Albany Felt's growth. By 1925 it was reporting $2.5 million in annual sales. Even then, Corning was anticipating that the explosive growth of the era would not persist, and made sure the company was operating at peak efficiency so as to better weather the inevitable recession. His concerns did not prevent the company from adding the two upper stories to the administrative wing in 1927, adding some ornamentation in the process.|$|E
50|$|New Jersey {{has seven}} tax {{brackets}} that determine {{state income tax}} rates, which range from 1.4% to 8.97%. The standard sales tax rate as of January 1, 2017, is 6.875%, applicable to all retail sales unless specifically exempt by law. Tax exemptions include most food items for at-home preparation, medications, most clothing, footwear, and <b>disposable</b> <b>paper</b> <b>products</b> {{for use in the}} home. Approximately 30 New Jersey municipalities are designated as Urban Enterprise Zones, in which shoppers are charged a 3½% sales tax rate, half of the rate charged outside the UEZs. Sections of Paterson, Elizabeth, and Jersey City are examples of communities that are subject to the lower sales tax rate.|$|E
50|$|In 2016 the {{occurrence}} of 3-MCPD in selected <b>paper</b> <b>products</b> (coffee filters, tea bags, <b>disposable</b> <b>paper</b> hot beverage cups, milk paperboard containers, paper towels) sold on the Canadian and German market was reported and the transfer of 3-MCPD from those products to beverages was investigated. Exposure to 3-MCPD from packaging material would likely constitute {{only a small percentage}} of overall dietary exposure when compared to the intake of processed oils/fats containing 3-MCPD equivalent (in form of fatty acid esters) which are often present at levels of about 0.2-2 µg/g.|$|R
5000|$|The {{owners manual}} for the cloth bag {{equipped}} machines {{recommended that the}} cloth bag be emptied after cleaning had been finished, to avoid dirt and bacteria from setting in the fibers of the bag, and preparing the machine for the next time. The cloth bag can be laundered periodically, if necessary. Starting with the Tradition model, an internal, <b>disposable</b> <b>paper</b> bag was introduced optionally {{in addition to the}} cotton cloth bag, so that customers could decide which method they preferred. The <b>disposable</b> <b>paper</b> bag offered the convenience of storing the cleaner when finished, and not requiring that the bag be emptied every time. When the Generation 3 was introduced in 1990, the only method of dirt collection was the <b>disposable</b> <b>paper</b> bag, and was later labeled [...] "Micron Magic" [...] with the Model G4, which can trap particles larger than three microns, while the cotton cloth bag traps any remaining particles that pass through. Starting with the Ultimate G Diamond Edition, the <b>disposable</b> <b>paper</b> bag was upgraded to HEPA standards.|$|R

40|$|The {{disposable}} sanitary protection (sanpro) {{market in}} the UK was worth £ 373 million in 2008 (<b>Disposable</b> <b>Paper</b> <b>Products,</b> Key Note Ltd 2010). This huge figure does not complete the whole sanpro market however, as there are {{a wide variety of}} reusable products also available. The disposable market has a great, negative environmental impact in terms of energy to produce (‘Life Cycle Assessment of Sanitary Pads and Tampons’, Royal Institute of Technology Stockholm, 2006) and end of life waste, it is therefore timely for a new, more environmentally friendly product suitable for a wide spectrum of women. This paper will investigate the essential properties and requirements of the textile required for a new sanitary product and will determine how relevant these properties are in terms of user experience both for wear and for disposal or after care. Two main products are investigated; disposable sanitary towels and reusable sanitary towels. Examining the physical characteristics such as absorbency, wicking, density and antimicrobial properties of the textile gives an indication of the suitability of the material choices. Users’ experience is also explored, as experiential data such as perceived comfort, dryness and reliability can only be determined by using the products. Research techniques have included focus groups and questionnaires. This paper will establish the key criteria for external sanitary protection based on research and investigation into traditional and newly developed textiles with a focus on the importance of women’s experience of existing product. ...|$|E

50|$|The <b>disposable</b> {{cone-shaped}} <b>paper</b> cup {{was invented}} in 1908 by Lawrence Luellen, and in 1912 Luellen and Hugh Moore began marketing the Health Kup, another <b>paper</b> <b>disposable</b> cup. The Health Kup was designed to create a means for people to drink water from public water barrels without spreading germs, which occurred when people would use a dipper or their own cup to hold the water. The Health Kup was later renamed to Dixie Cup, and was named after a brand of dolls. Luellen and Moore later developed a <b>disposable</b> <b>paper</b> ice cream cup, which included lids with images of sportspeople, movie stars and animals.|$|R

50|$|Based {{on these}} concerns, and as paper goods (especially after the 1908 {{invention}} of the Dixie Cup) became cheaply and cleanly available, local bans were passed on the shared-use cup.

By 1917, the public glass had disappeared from railway carriages, replaced by paper cups even in jurisdictions where public glasses {{had yet to be}} banned.|$|R
50|$|A {{desk pad}} or blotter is a table {{protector}} used when work such as painting or writing would otherwise damage the table or desk.

This led to the closure of its production plant in Liverpool in 1983, as it proved too costly for DRG Cups to maintain a competitive position. The company was eventually bought out by Polarcup (a subsidiary of Finland-based company Huhtamaki), which opened a new paper cup manufacturing plant in Devizes, Wiltshire, in 1984.|$|R
