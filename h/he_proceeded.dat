5|$|At a VCA {{meeting in}} April 1981, Loxton {{announced}} that he was severing all connections with organised cricket. He initially said that he was resigning for family reasons, as he would be moving to the Gold Coast in Queensland with his wife. However, <b>he</b> <b>proceeded</b> to give a blunt 15-minute speech, claiming that he had lost the art of communicating with the players and expressing his disenchantment with some aspects of the game, a reference to the declining player conduct. After relocating to the Gold Coast, he was unable to turn his back on cricket, and umpired matches at local level into his 70s. Although he became severely visually impaired, Loxton still attended matches and asked his companions to describe the proceedings for him; ever opinionated and blunt, he still offered advice to local cricketers.|$|E
5|$|Bjaðmunjo Mýrjartaksdóttir (also {{known in}} Old Norse as Bjaðmynja; and in Gaelic as Ben Muman, Bé Binn, Blathmuine, and Bláthmín; fl. 1102/1103) was a {{daughter}} of a Muirchertach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland. In 1102 whilst still a child, {{she was married to}} Sigurðr, son of Magnús Óláfsson, King of Norway. At this time, Magnús appears to have been in the process of setting up his son as king over the Earldom of Orkney, the Kingdom of the Isles, and the Kingdom of Dublin. The marriage itself temporarily bound Muirchertach and Magnús together as allies before the latter's death the following year. Sigurðr thereupon repudiated Bjaðmunjo, and left for Scandinavia, where <b>he</b> <b>proceeded</b> to share the Norwegian kingship with his brothers.|$|E

He later explained that he was giving them an opportunity to reconsider their actions and avoid discharges, which would have been irrevocable. The police union members responded that same day by voting 1134 to 2 in favor of a strike and scheduled it to start at evening roll call the next day. Their stated grounds omitted wages and working conditions. They said the strike's rationale was to protest the Commissioner's denial of their right to ally themselves with the AFL.|$|E

Smith took a picture of the scoreboard from the 1982 Championship, modified it to read 1993 and erased the name Georgetown, leaving that space blank. <b>He</b> <b>proceeded</b> to place copies of the doctored photo in all of the players' lockers.|$|E

He struggled in the one-day series, scoring just 36runs in three matches, but finished as the top run-scorer in the youth Tests; with 377 at an average of 62.83.|$|E
5|$|Hindman's edicts, however, {{raised the}} ire of the local citizenry, and his {{political}} enemies demanded that the Confederate leaders in Richmond replace him.

Hindman convinced Holmes {{to give him a}} field command in northern Arkansas, and <b>he</b> <b>proceeded</b> with a plan to drive out the invader. Hindman aggressively moved into northwest Arkansas and managed to intercept the Federal army while it was divided into two parts. At this moment, however, Hindman's normally aggressive style gave way to uncharacteristic doubt. Rather than attack the divided pieces of the Federal army, Hindman entrenched himself at Prairie Grove, Arkansas, allowing the Federal forces to recombine and assault him.|$|E
