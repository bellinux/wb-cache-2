40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} a firm's debt financing decision on the informativeness of the <b>income</b> <b>statement.</b> This study specifically examines the association between a firm's bank dependence and the value relevance of the <b>income</b> <b>statement</b> by investigating the income-statement conservatism of firms with bank loans. Focusing on relatively small businesses, this study finds that income-statement conservatism, measured as timely loss recognition, is increasing in a firm's bank dependence. This study also finds that the value relevance of the <b>income</b> <b>statement</b> is increasing in a firm's bank dependence. The findings of this paper suggest that the usefulness of the <b>income</b> <b>statement</b> varies with a firm's bank dependence, indicating that the value relevance of the <b>income</b> <b>statement</b> is a function of a firm's debt financing decision. The findings further suggest that bank relationships affect the value relevance of the <b>income</b> <b>statement</b> through their influence on income-statement conservatism.
