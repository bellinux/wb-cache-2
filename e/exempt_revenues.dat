[...] Its president was an American and former news reporter named Jerry Jarvis and the Maharishi is reported to have had [...] "no legal, official or paid relationship with WPEC". WPEC was an umbrella organization and operated almost exclusively on revenues generated from TM course fees. It featured corporate trappings such as [...] "computerized mailings, high-speed communications, links, even a well-turned medical and life insurance plan for its employees". WPEC supervised the 375 urban TM centers as well as several failed resorts that were purchased or leased as [...] "forest academies" [...] for in-residence meditation classes and courses.

40|$|Granting {{exemptions}} {{from the}} property tax has been criticized because it eliminates a source of municipal <b>revenue.</b> <b>Exempt</b> properties appear to be concentrated in urban areas, so this effect is especially problematic for cities because {{of the existence of}} urban fiscal stress. Recent writers have indicated that exempt institutions may provide valuable services to their communities, but the cost of municipal services to their properties represents a significant fiscal impact on local governments. This paper investigates the fiscal impact of a single exempt institution, Brown University, on the City of Providence, R. I. Fiscal impact analyses were used to measure the cost of municipal services provided to the university. The results of this investigation are that the costs of services to exempt educational institutions are minimal, and are not significant in view of the total municipal budget...|$|R

5000|$|In 1961, the United States Internal Revenue Service {{announced}} {{that since the}} Amish refuse Social Security benefits and have a religious objection to insurance, they need not pay these taxes. In 1965, this policy was codified into law. Self-employed individuals in certain sects do not pay into, nor receive benefits from, United States Social Security, nor do their similarly <b>exempt</b> employees. Internal <b>Revenue</b> Service form 4029 grants this exemption to members of a religious group that is conscientiously opposed to accepting benefits of any private or public insurance, provides a reasonable level of living for its dependent members and has existed continuously since December 31, 1950. A visible sign of the care Amish provide for the elderly are the smaller Grossdaadi Hauser or Daadihauser ("grandfather houses"), often built near the main dwelling. Amish employees of non-Amish employers are taxed, {{but they do not}} apply for benefits. Aside from Social Security and workers' compensation, American Amish pay all required taxes. At least one group of Amish farmers in Lancaster County Pennsylvania has formed a cooperative engaged in Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) agreements with non-Amish families. Working through the Lancaster Farm Fresh Cooperative [...] this group of Amish farmers provide organic vegetables to CSA groups in Pennsylvania and surrounding states, including New York. This interaction has resulted in annual dinners where non-Amish CSA members are hosted at the farms of their Amish providers.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} at Pescia,now in the Province of Pistoia, Italy. He {{was related to the}} Piccolomini of Siena. He {{acquired}} his literary and theological education in Florence. Under Pope Nicholas V he went to Rome, where, for a while, he lived in extreme penury. In 1450, he became private secretary to Cardinal Domenico Capranica; later Pope Callixtus III appointed him Secretary of Briefs. He was retained in this office by Pope Pius II, who also made him a member of the pontifical household, on which occasion he assumed the family name of Piccolomini. In 1460 he was made Bishop of Pavia by Pius II, and was Pius's most trusted confidant and adviser throughout his pontificate. Ammannati exhibited paternal solicitude in the government of his diocese, and during his prolonged absences entrusted its affairs to able vicars, with whom he remained in constant touch. On 18 December 1461, Ammannati was made a cardinal, and was commonly known as the Cardinal of Pavia. He accompanied Pius II to Ancona and attended him in his last illness. In the subsequent conclave he favored the election of Pope Paul II, whose displeasure he afterward incurred by insisting on the full observance of the ante-election capitulations that the pope had signed. The imprisonment of his private secretary by Paul II on a charge of complicity in the Conspiracy of the Roman Academy offended Ammannati still more, and his open defense of the secretary aggravated the pope's ill-will. The disfavor in which he was held by Paul II did not <b>exempt</b> his episcopal <b>revenues</b> from sequestration by the Duke of Milan, Galeazzo Maria. It was due to his insistence that Paul II took energetic measures against King George Podiebrad of Bohemia. Pope Sixtus IV was scarcely more favorable towards Ammannati than was Paul II.|$|R
