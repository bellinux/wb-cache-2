This trend helps the vision of sustainability, but it is hindered by various <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>technical</b> <b>constraints.</b> Some of the existing solutions put some customers in a disadvantageous position, which is often overlooked while developing technical solutions. In this paper, the most common solutions to cope with overvoltage are analyzed, including inverters with ON/OFF switching and droop-based control features. These two techniques place customers connected {{to the end of}} a radial feeder in a disadvantageous position, by curtailing their power generation more than their counterparts who are connected closer to the MV/LV transformer; a situation generally known as unfair power curtailment. In this paper, an efficient solution for voltage rise is proposed, which mitigates voltage rise using conventional droop control techniques, but also provides fair power curtailment among all customers by exploiting the sensitivity matrix of the examined radial feeder. The proposed control strategy is implemented in a flexible simulation platform, based on MATLAB and OpenDSS.

Increasing population pressure and climatic changes {{have combined to}} render long-fallow periods less feasible and effective. Transhumant pastoralism, a productive and historically important pattern of livestock production in the Sahel, is under severe stress due to periodic droughts and extension of cropped lands into range-lands. This paper examines alternative options through which the integration of livestock and crop production could contribute to an intensification of agricultural production and enhance the maintenance of soil fertility in semi-arid West Africa. It reviews several aspects of livestock production focusing on social, <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>technical</b> <b>constraints</b> to pastoral production and to efficient integration of crop and livestock activities.

40|$|Anaerobic {{fermentation}} {{of agricultural}} wastes such as crop residues and animal manure, producing biogas, {{is an example}} of an advanced biofuel that can contribute to the EU target of a minimum 10 % of transport fuels from renewable sources in 2020. Producing biogas from residues has received increasing attention following the debate on the impact conventional biofuel production has on food prices, poverty and land-use change. The EU, as well as major producers of biogas such as Germany and Italy, are currently revising their policy framework to incentivize the sourcing of biogas substrates from waste streams. Given these developments it is important to improve our understanding of how large the potential is for producing biogas and biomethane from agricultural wastes in the EU, how that potential is distributed across member states, and what the main limitations to this potential are. Previous studies on the potential for producing biogas from agricultural wastes in the EU, however, have either been local cases studies that account for a host of detailed <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>technical</b> <b>constraints,</b> an approach that is almost impossible to scale up to the EU level, or top-down assessments of gross substrate potentials that do not account for any of the technical and economic limitations specific to biogas production. In this report we present a spatially explicit approach for estimating the availability of agricultural wastes - crop residues and animal manure - across the EU, which also allows for an analysis of how key <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>technical</b> <b>constraints</b> such as minimum viable plant size, maximum collection distances for substrates, and substrate composition affects the total potential for biogas production. Our main results from this analysis can be summarized as follows: * Total annually available biogas substrates from agricultural wastes in the EU 28 amounts to roughly 80 million tonnes of crop residues (dry matter) and 110 million tonnes (dry matter) of animal manure. * In our base case scenario, three quarters of the manure and a fifth of the crop residues are technically and economically exploitable for biogas production, yielding a total biogas potential from agricultural wastes of almost 700 PJ (HHV) per year. * Animal production and arable farming are spatially highly segregated {{in some parts of the}} EU 28. This leads to some areas having considerable surpluses of either dry, carbon-rich crop residues or nitrogen-rich manures which cannot be fully utilized due to technical constraints on dry matter content and carbon-to-nitrogen ratios. There are, however, potential ways to relax these constraints, for example using dry fermentation technology or adding wet, carbon-rich co-substrates, such as energy crops. * If we assume a larger minimum viable biogas plant size of 8 MW, typical if the biogas is to be upgraded to vehicle fuel quality, the potential decreases by about a quarter. However, the base case potential can still be reached or even surpassed under this constraint if one allows for a somewhat increased collection radius for substrates or if the constraint on maximum dry matter content is relaxed...|$|E

The input–output model is a tool for analyzing the interdependence and mutual <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>technical</b> <b>constraints</b> of various sectors of the national economy in the production process. This method uses the input–output identity and input–output multiplier model to measure the direct and indirect contributions of exports to the economy. The contribution takes place after the exports have a cyclic cumulative effect on the economy through the relationships among various production sectors of the national economy. Shen and Wu (2004) developed a method that uses input–output tables to measure the contribution of exports to the formation and growth of GDP. This method calculated and analyzed the contribution of each sector’s exports to China’s GDP growth and analyzed and revealed {{the reasons for the}} declining contribution rate of unit exports from 1997 to 2001. Many similar studies have been conducted, including those by Mattoo et al. (2013), Shen (2011) and Koopman et al. (Koopman et al. 2014). Compared with the first three quantitative analysis methods, this fourth method has the advantage of using a multiplier principle to satisfy the relationships among the national economic accounts and takes full account of the impact of economic structures. The input–output method thus measures both the macroeconomic effects and sector impacts. The disadvantage of this method is that it carries higher data requirements and requires the use of input–output tables.|$|E

The Adour-Garonne watershed (116. 000 km 2, South-West France) is emblematic of such situations, with recurring occurrence of quantitative water management crises due to high agricultural withdrawals during the low flow period. Since opportunities to store more water is limited, authorities require the agricultural sector to reduce its demand, which results in a conflicting situation as irrigation is a key production factor for farming systems in this area. Our study {{is embedded in the}} governance challenge of conciliating water resources protection <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> viability of agriculture by re-thinking agricultural land use in interaction with both agricultural land managers (i. e. mainly farmers) and water managers. Our objective was to design and assess alternative agro-hydrosystem (i. e. new cropping systems and/or new distribution of cropping systems over fields and new water resource management strategies).

30|$|Transmission system plays a {{significant}} role in electric power system. It is not only a linkage between the generation and distribution, but also provides a non-discriminative and reliable environment for demanders and suppliers [1]. With the growth of load demand, the generation expansion planning (GEP) and transmission expansion planning (TEP) become more and more important. The main objective of TEP is to develop the system as economically as possible [2] due to the load growth, and it is subject to a set of <b>economic,</b> <b>technical</b> <b>and</b> reliability <b>constraints</b> [1, 3]. In the regulated market, GEP and TEP are sub-tasks of a power system planning process performed by a regulated power utility. However, in the deregulated market environment, TEP is usually performed separately by transmission network service providers, while GEP becomes the task of generation companies or investors [4]. In the conventional monopolistic market, the power utilities have the social obligations to provide a reliable electricity supply. In a competitive market, the reliability of service is one of the important factors for market competitiveness [5, 6]. Therefore, a reliability level is an important constraint for TEP process. In addition, at the time of preparation for maintenance scheduling, a certain level of supplying reliability must be guaranteed after some power system components which are in outage and maintenance state [7, 8]. Thus, reliability evaluation and reinforcement are very meaningful works both in the power system planning or maintenance scheduling.|$|R

Aquatic Ecosystem Enhancement (AEE) at mountaintop mining sites is one of fourteen technical areas identified for study by the EIS Interagency Steering Committee.

40|$|Generation {{expansion}} planning {{consists of}} finding the optimal long-term plan {{for the construction of}} new generation capacity subject to various <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>technical</b> <b>constraints.</b> It usually involves solving a large-scale, non-linear discrete and dynamic optimisation problem in a highly constrained and uncertain environment. Traditional approaches to capacity planning have focused on achieving a least-cost plan. During the last two decades however, new paradigms for expansion planning have emerged that are driven by environmental and political factors. This has resulted in the formulation of multi-criteria approaches that enable power system planners to simultaneously consider multiple and conflicting objectives in the decision-making process. More recently, the increasing integration of intermittent renewable energy sources in the grid to sustain power system decarbonisation and energy security has introduced new challenges. Such a transition spawns new dynamics pertaining to the variability and uncertainty of these generation resources in determining the best mix. In addition to ensuring adequacy of generation capacity, it is essential to consider the operational characteristics of the generation sources in the planning process. In this paper, we first review the evolution of generation expansion planning techniques in the face of more stringent environmental policies and growing uncertainty. More importantly, we highlight the emerging challenges presented by the intermittent nature of some renewable energy sources. In particular, we discuss the power supply adequacy and operational flexibility issues introduced by variable renewable sources as well as the attempts made to address them. Finally, we identify important future research directions...|$|E

Thus, the text interrogates how actors inside the firm mediate between {{the demands of the}} public on the one hand, and the <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>technical</b> <b>constraints</b> of the corporation on the other. Theoretically, the text sets out to make two contributions. First, following Bruno Latour's critique of modernity, it explores the modern conception of the economy, in which markets and firms are construed as natural phenomena that are separate from cultural, political and 'subjective' processes. Secondly, building on Michel Gallon's work on economic markets, the text examines the practices by which corporate professionals 'invent' new areas of corporate responsibility, and thus participate in the 'reframing' of the automotive market. With regard to methodology, the thesis argues that ethnographies of corporations and their social responsibilities require interventionist modes of inquiry, where researchers 'take sides' and assist in the construction of certain forms of economic action. The thesis concludes that - contrary to the modern conception of markets and firms - the business operations of Volvo have continually been entangled in processes of idealism, politics and ideology. Moreover, the way in which corporate professionals readily traverse the 'inside' and the 'outsides' of the corporation shows that - again, contrary to the modern conception of markets and firms - the boundaries of the firm are fluid and penetrable...|$|E
40|$|Industrial {{revolution}} brought coal, {{a fossil}} fuel, {{to the forefront}} of the global energy scene. This was later overtaken by another fossil fuel, crude oil; and natural gas is trying fast to take over the dominant role in the world energy supply mix. The increasing world-wide awareness and concern about the environmental impacts of fossil fuels coupled with the oil price shocks of the early 1970 s and late 1980 s, and likely future price hikes, have lent enormous weight to a switch to renewable energy sources. This paper therefore looks at biogas (renewable) energy use in Nigeria, a country which is fossil fuels rich and an oil exporting nation. In order to contain the uncertainty usually associated with structural transformation of the economy typical of a developing country like Nigeria, a three scenario analysis has been adopted to examine the future prospects of biogas in the country. While a generated energy from biogas would range between 5. 0 - 171. 0 x 1012 J in the period 2000 - 2030 under a moderate ambitious biogas technology programme, some constraints may hinder this realization. These include <b>economic,</b> <b>technical</b> <b>and</b> socio-cultural <b>constraints.</b> Recommendations to overcome these constraints and make biogas technology penetrate even more than already projected into the rural communities and poor urban households have been suggested. Part of the envisaged benefits of biogas use to the national economy includes the avoidable CO 2 emissions. If biogas displaces kerosene, at least between 357 - 60, 952 tons of CO 2 per annum would be avoided. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a spatially explicit method for making regional {{estimates of the}} potential for biogas production from crop residues and manure, accounting for key <b>technical,</b> biochemical, environmental <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> <b>constraints.</b> Methods for making such estimates are important as biofuels from agricultural residues are receiving increasing policy support from the EU and major biogas producers, such as Germany and Italy, in response to concerns over unintended negative environmental and social impacts of conventional biofuels. This analysis comprises a spatially explicit estimate of crop residue and manure production for the EU at 250 m resolution, and a biogas production model accounting for local constraints such as the sustainable removal of residues, transportation of substrates, and the substrates' biochemical suitability for anaerobic digestion. In our base scenario, the EU biogas production potential from crop residues and manure is about 0. 7 EJ/year, nearly double the current EU production of biogas from agricultural substrates, most of which does not come from residues or manure. An extensive sensitivity analysis of the model shows that the potential could easily be 50 % higher or lower, depending on the stringency of <b>economic,</b> <b>technical</b> <b>and</b> biochemical <b>constraints.</b> We find that the potential is particularly sensitive to constraints on the substrate mixtures' carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and dry matter concentration. Hence, the potential to produce biogas from crop residues and manure in the EU depends to large extent on the possibility to overcome the challenges associated with these substrates, either by complementing them with suitable co-substrates (e. g. household waste and energy crops), or through further development of biogas technology (e. g. pretreatment of substrates and recirculation of effluent) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} half century, {{there has been a}} {{remarkable}} expansion in the rate and scale of dam construction worldwide. Many of these dams have been successful in providing various economic benefits. However, reservoir sedimentation decreases useful capacity of dams, shortens their <b>economic</b> life, <b>and</b> increases the need of potential dam development in the future. Also, maintenance of aging dams often involves considerable environmental and social costs to the society. Management of dams requires the study of available options and possible solutions to the problem of reservoir sedimentation and dam removal. ^ This dissertation provides a framework for assessing management strategies to achieve sustainable use of dams. First, an analysis of sediment removal techniques is made to examine their <b>economic</b> performance <b>and</b> the need for actions to conserve storage reservoirs. The case study of the Sefid-Rud reservoir in Iran shows that the technique of sediment-flushing is capable of retaining the useful storage capacity {{for a wide range of}} <b>economic</b> parameters <b>and</b> site-specific <b>technical</b> <b>constraints.</b> Innovations that relax some of these constraints could produce significant economic benefits. ^ Second, the framework of analysis is extended to situations involving externalities through sedimentation. Using the data from Mahaweli Cascade, Sri Lanka, it is shown that the total economic return from managing a system of cascading dams is increased when the negative externality from sediment release to downstream reservoirs is controlled. The results also indicate that the imputed external cost of sedimentation is likely to be high for a large-scale reservoir. The estimated external cost can be used to design policies for managing sediment along the river. ^ Lastly, an option-pricing model is developed to help formulate guidelines for dam removal decisions. Key factors that determine the desirability of dam rehabilitation versus removal are identified. For example, lower discount rates and a lower level of uncertainty make dam removal a more attractive option, while high decommissioning cost is likely to delay its timing. The case study of the Pak Mun Dam in Thailand indicates that the threshold level of damage for dam rehabilitation is $ 5. 27 M and dam removal should be undertaken when the damage reaches $ 15. 26 M. ...|$|R

With respect to the latter, the exergy concept pops up. Although its fundamentals, that is, the Second Law of Thermodynamics, were already established in the 1800 s, {{it is only in}} the last years that the exergy concept has gained a more widespread interest in process analysis, typically employed to identify inefficiencies. However, exergy analysis today is implemented far beyond technical analysis; it is also employed in environmental, (thermo) economic, and even sustainability analysis of industrial systems. Because natural ecosystems are also subjected to the basic laws of thermodynamics, it is another subject of exergy analysis. After an introduction on the concept itself, this review focuses on the potential and limitations of the exergy concept in (1) ecosystem analysis, utilized to describe maximum storage and maximum dissipation of energy flows (2); industrial system analysis: from single process analysis to complete process chain analysis (3); (thermo) economic analysis, with extended exergy accounting; and (4) environmental impact assessment throughout the whole life cycle with quantification of the resource intake and emission effects. Apart from technical system analysis, it proves that exergy as a tool in environmental impact analysis may be the most mature field of application, particularly with respect to resource and efficiency accounting, one of the major challenges in the development of sustainable technology. Far less mature is the exergy analysis of natural ecosystems and the coupling with economic analysis, where a lively debate is presently going on about the actual merits of an exergy-based approach. status: publishe...|$|E

More importantly, if TD-SCDMA dominates the Chinese mobile market - a market that covers almost a quarter of the world's population, {{it is quite possible that}} TDSCDMA will be diffused to other economies, including Hong Kong SAR. Therefore, the fortune of TDSCDMA is not just relevant to Chinese manufacturing industry, but also to foreign vendors. The establishment of the TD-SCDMA forum in later 2000 is a clear sign that foreign vendors have realised the implications of the Chinese standard to their future business. 3 G implies an opportunity for China, but imposes some challenges on Hong Kong SAR. Due to limited spectrum, it is unclear whether the current competitive 2 G market can be successfully transferred to a competitive 3 G market in the future. Also, OFTA's traditional licensing and regulatory scheme for 2 G services has also been threatened by the <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>technical</b> <b>constraints</b> of 3 G services. Whether or not the innovative 3 G licensing framework and open network requirement of the Government will be successful remains to be seen. 3 G mobile is not just an innovative technology and service, but it also brings about new economic and regulatory dynamics. It seems difficult to formulate a harmonised regulatory framework, because economies with different economic considerations might focus on different aspects of 3 G development, like we have seen with China and Hong Kong SAR. Nevertheless, the common objective remains to derive the maximum benefit for the overall economy...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{has attempted to}} provide acurrent estimate of the oil potential of the northern North Sea from which estimates of exploration investment, development investment, and accruing cash-flows can be derived. Current proven reserves are estimated at 29. 4 billion barrels oil equivalent, of which 22. 6 billion barrels are oil. Of the 59 discoveries documented, 8 can be classed as true gas accumulations. Undiscovered potential for the area of study is estimated at 24. 3 billion barrels, giving a most probable ultimate recoverable reserve of 53. 7 billion barrels oil equivalent. Depending on minimum commercial field size, recoverable oil reserves should vary between 33. 7 and 39. 2 billion barrels. Current development of 14. 8 billion barrels of recoverable oil involves an estimated capital investment of $ 16. 8 billion dollars. Peak daily production is estimated to occur in 1981 at 4. 12 million barrels daily. An additional 4. 6 billion barrels of recoverable oil is {{in various stages of}} evaluation and will probably be developed, yielding a total of 19. 4 billion barrels of reserves and a total peak production of 4. 95 million barrels per day in 1981. Capital investment is estimated at $ 27 billion dollars for the total. In order to develop current plus discovered plus future discoveries, private industry is estimated to require between $ 56 and $ 70 billion dollars. Most of this investment, including approximately $ 6 billion additional outlay for exploration, is anticipated to occur between now and 1985. Peak production of 6. 58 to 7. 85 million barrels per day is estimated to occur around 1986, representing a total reserve development of approximately 34. 4 to 38. 4 billion barrels of oil. Private industry is anticipated to earn between $ 30 and $ 56 billion dollars whereas government take, assuming a lower discount rate, is estimated to run between $ 83 and $ 222 billion dollars. Critical to this analysis are assumptions about host-government tax policy and the world price of crude oil, especially as pertaining to "marginal" North Sea fields. Utilizing an econometric model developed by the Supply Analysis Group of the M. I. T. World Oil Project, investigation of discounted cash-flow profiles for various field sizes indicates that access to crude supply and development of subsequent discoveries appear to be the primary economic incentives for continuing to operate smaller fields after peak production is obtained. Tax policy and high operating costs relative to productive capacity tend to make small fields less attractive investments. Finally, it is patently obvious that very high per-well productivity is essential for viable development of North Sea fields under current <b>economic,</b> political, fiscal, <b>and</b> <b>technical</b> <b>constraints.</b> Originally presented as the author's thesis, (M.

40|$|Access to {{electricity}} {{is a key}} factor behind development and expansion of modern societies, and electric power systems are the backbone infrastructure for economic growth of nations and communities. However, {{more than a billion}} {{people all over the world}} have no or limited access to electricity and are deprived of basic services. Furthermore, there are many communities that rely on small-scale isolated microgrids to supply their electric power demands, and many challenges exist in keeping those microgrids operating. The cost of operating isolated microgrids is a major issue which impacts the availability of a proper power network in remote communities. Hence, many organizations, communities and governments around the world are looking into alternative options for electrification of remote communities by considering Renewable Energy (RE) resources, such as wind and solar power, and utilization of Energy Storage Systems (ESS). This thesis investigates the feasibility of RE deployment in remote communities, by proposing a generalized optimal planning platform and conducting comprehensive simulation studies based on real measured data, and evaluates the impact of <b>economic,</b> <b>technical</b> <b>and</b> operation <b>constraints</b> on the planning of an isolated microgrid involving conventional generation, RE resources and ESS. This work suggests that further investigation should be made on the potential impacts of the integration of RE resource on systems operation constraints, such as frequency and voltage regulation, and the results justify the importance of such investigations. Detailed studies on the impact of operation constraints on the planning and sizing of the microgrid are performed. The impact of ESS on planning studies and its potential role in system operation are analyzed. Furthermore, the impact of RE integration on reduction of diesel generation and thus carbon footprint in remote communities is evaluated. The inclusion of a demand response management strategy in microgrid planning problem is considered and its impact on the integration of RE and ESS in remote communities is analyzed. The proposed planning platform is applied to the microgrid of Kasabonika Lake First Nation (KLFN), a northern Ontario remote community. The results indicate that RE and ESS integration projects are achievable considering alternative incentives and funding resources. It is also shown that frequency regulation constraints have remarkable impact on the sizing of the RE units and ESS. A sensitivity analysis is also performed in order to study the effect of variable parameters on the optimal design of the microgrid at KLFN...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} design, implementation {{and evaluation of}} a gender-inclusive information system linking rural women in Agni Hiya, Morocco and water project managers from the Association Dar Si-Hmad. This research was motivated by an interest in exploring the linkages between {{information and communication technologies}} (ICT), climate change, natural resource management and women’s participation in community development in the drought-ridden Aït Baamrane region of southwest Morocco. The research investigates the potential for mobile phones to help address communication constraints that rural Berber women face, including culture, religion, and lack of digital literacy. These issues are relevant to the study and design of a gender-inclusive information system (the “Fog Phone”) intended to help manage a fogwater distribution system that will deliver water from the Anti-Atlas Mountains to Berber villages. The research investigates two similar groups of low-literate, marginalized rural Berber women from the same geographic community who have mobile phones. Technology-focused ethnographic research methods were used to first investigate the social, cultural and technical factors involved in mobile phone use by women employed in an Argan oil Cooperative. Findings from the Argan oil Cooperative study were then applied and expanded in a study of Berber women involved in the operation of the fogwater system. By virtue of their responsibilities as principal water gatherers and water users in the community, Berber women are key stakeholders in the fogwater system. Their continued involvement in water management was extended to the participatory design and development of the prototype Fog Phone. Cultural conditions restricting communication between unrelated men and women led to an information system design that supported cultural, social, <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>technical</b> <b>constraints.</b> The Fog Phone enabled women to report on the water system using a series of symbols that communicate water system status without violating cultural norms. In addition to an exploration of the relationship between gender and technology, this research explores related themes of climate change and environmental vulnerability as they pertain to women’s lives and livelihoods, as well as the ability of rural Berber women to manage the environmental assets on which their livelihoods depend. The contributions of this research include a prototype information system for the fogwater project; {{a better understanding of the}} mobile phone utility gap and its impact on the use of ICT by marginalized women in polyglot and oral-language dependent communities; and advances in the emerging practice of ICTs, Climate Change and Development (ICCD) by providing a case study of the linkages between mobile phones, water resources that are affected by climate change and women in rural communities involved in an environmentally sustainable development project in the Middle East and North Africa – a region that is largely missing from ICCD and overall ICT for Development research...|$|E
