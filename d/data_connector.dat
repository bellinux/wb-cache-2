These components support on the discovery of marine wildlife migratory behaviours, some of which may be a direct consequence of the changing Met-Ocean resources and the globe climatic changes. In EO 4 wildlife, we specifically focus on the implementation of web-enabled advanced analytics web services which comply with OGC standards and make them accessible to a wide research community for investigating on trends of animal behaviour around specific marine regions of interest. Big <b>data</b> <b>connectors</b> and a catalogue service are being installed to enable access to COPERNICUS sentinels and ARGOS sat-ellite big data together with other in situ heterogeneous sources. Furthermore, da-ta mining services are being developed for knowledge extraction on species habi-tats and temporal behaviour trends. Also, high level fusion and reasoning ser-vices which process big data observations are deployed to forecast marine wild-life behaviour with estimated uncertainties. These will be tested and demonstrated under targeted thematic scenarios in EO 4 wildlife using a Big Data platform a cloud resource...|$|R
50|$|CFast {{cards are}} not {{physically}} or electrically compatible with CompactFlash cards. However, since SATA can emulate the PATA command protocol, existing CompactFlash software drivers can be used, although writing new drivers to use AHCI instead of PATA emulation will almost always result in significant performance gains. CFast cards use a female 7-pin SATA <b>data</b> <b>connector,</b> {{and a female}} 17-pin power connector, so an adaptor is required to connect CFast cards in place of standard SATA hard drives which use male connectors.|$|E
