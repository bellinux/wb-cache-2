50|$|The {{new program}} center also houses a <b>dark</b> <b>room.</b> 35mm <b>cameras</b> and film, {{as well as}} {{chemicals}} for developing photos, are provided to campers, with which they take many nature photos and develop them throughout the session.|$|R
50|$|Later, Adam remembers {{seeing the}} puppet in his {{apartment}} when the lights went out. As he was searching through the <b>dark</b> <b>rooms</b> using his <b>camera</b> flash, the puppet's eerie laugh rang through the apartment, and Adam hit it with a bat until it stopped.|$|R
50|$|Kinetic light {{painting}} {{is achieved by}} moving the camera, and {{is the antithesis of}} traditional photography. At night, or in a <b>dark</b> <b>room,</b> the <b>camera</b> can be removed from the tripod and used like a paintbrush. An example is using the night sky as the canvas, the camera as the brush and artificially-lit cityscapes as the palette. Putting energy into moving the camera by stroking lights, making patterns and laying down backgrounds can create abstract artistic images.|$|R

Said camera fixer is mounted to two arc tracks of the <b>dark</b> <b>room</b> frame covered by said shielding article. Said light source and camera are mounted to the camera holder on the camera fixer. Its advantages are no distortion of tongue picture, high correctness, simple structure and low cost.

5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Amazing" [...] premiered on 13 January 2012, {{at a total}} length of four minutes and six-seconds. The video shows scenes of Cardle {{performing}} the song in a <b>dark</b> <b>room,</b> direct to <b>camera.</b> Certain shots are filmed in a [...] style, with the camera and boom operators being seen in shot. It also shows scenes of couples in the surrounding studio, either upset or re-uniting.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} sees the band {{performing}} in a <b>dark</b> <b>room,</b> with the <b>camera</b> panning around {{them while they}} are performing. The action is seen in slow motion, and are actually performing [...] "Godzilla" [...] from their Comfort in Sound album, with the video slown down with [...] "Find the Colour" [...] edited into the video {{so it looks like}} they are performing a different song. This could be seen as the band not being too keen on having the song as a single release.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Light source {{temperature}} measurement {{has been an}} important aspect in many industrial applications. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the temperature of different sources like flames, incandescent lamps. The sensor installation is difficult in these sources. Imaging these sources to correlate with the temperature is attempted. A digital still camera is used to capture the source images. The optical characteristics of CCD sensor are not mentioned in the camera specifications. It is desired that the device bandwidth should be greater than the source bandwidth. Hence, the optical characteristics of the camera are also obtained. As Incandescent lamp is the most familiar light source its photographs are taken. The images are taken at known excitation voltages in a <b>dark</b> <b>room</b> with <b>camera</b> settings unaltered. Filament temperature is a function of intensity. Intensity difference of two consecutive images is found out by image subtraction. Unwanted part of image, like reflection from the shell is removed by thresholding and segmentation. The colour temperature of the filament can be found out with reference to black body radiations. If these values are compared with standard temperatures, source temperature values can be predicted...|$|R
40|$|The {{change in}} {{backscattering}} parameters during {{the appearance of}} chilling injury in bananas was investigated. Bananas were stored at a chilling temperature for two days and the degrees of the chilling injuries that appeared were measured before, during and after storage using backscattering imaging and visual assessment. Laser lights at 660 nm and 785 nm wavelengths were shot consecutively onto the samples in a <b>dark</b> <b>room</b> and a <b>camera</b> was used to capture the backscattered lights that appeared on the samples. The captured images were analysed and the changes of intensity against pixel count were plotted into graphs. The plotted graph provides useful information of backscattering parameters such as inflection point (IP), slope after inflection point (SA), and full width at half maximum (FWHM) and saturation radius (RSAT). Results of statistical analysis indicated that there were significant changes of these backscattering parameters as chilling injury developed...|$|R
40|$|Physical model {{experiments}} {{based on}} Light Transmission Visualization (LTV) method {{were conducted to}} study and observe the migration of dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPL) in both single and double-porosity soil mediums. DNAPL that used in the research is tetrachloroethylene (PCE). Aggregated kaolin was prepared and acts as double-porosity soil medium whereas Ottawa sand represent single-porosity soil medium. A three-dimensional rectangular acrylic model which filled with soil samples was then mounted on a light box and placed inside a <b>dark</b> <b>room.</b> A digital <b>camera</b> starts capture images of DNAPL migration once known amounts of DNAPL is injected into flow chamber. In {{the end of the}} experiments, digital images were collected and analyzed by using Image-Pro Premier 9. 1 which is an image analysis software. The analysis focused on the cumulative area, depth, saturation as well as rate of DNAPL migration. It was found that the DNAPL migrate much faster in double-porosity soil compared to single-porosity soil. The total cumulative DNAPL migration area in double-porosity soil also larger than single porosity soil. This shows that the existence of inter-aggregate pores in double-porosity soil medium has significant impact on the migration of immiscible fluids within double-porosity soils...|$|R
5000|$|A {{darkroom}} or <b>dark</b> <b>room</b> is {{a darkened}} room, sometimes {{located in a}} nightclub, gay bathhouse or sex club, where sexual activity can take place.

5000|$|The next album, <b>Dark</b> <b>Room,</b> was {{released}} in 1985. The punk sound wasn't gone but the heavier side of the band was very apparent. As its title suggests, <b>Dark</b> <b>Room</b> indeed had a dark feel to it. Thanks to a generous helping of metal infused punk resounding through songs like [...] "Tongue Like A Battering Ram", [...] "Terror In The Streets", and [...] "Deathless", {{as well as the}} [...] The band pays a cheeky punk homage to their favorite drink of choice in [...] "Let's Go Get Cokes". The production and mixing of <b>Dark</b> <b>Room</b> was much stronger and the best sounding album in the band's catalog. In addition to Corpse In Disguise and <b>Dark</b> <b>Room</b> the period between 1984-85 saw the band contribute tracks that were added to various skate compilations. <b>Dark</b> <b>Room</b> would be the last album before the band's breakup.|$|R

The <b>Dark</b> <b>Room</b> Collective had a mission of forming a community of new African American writers. Strange can be quoted as saying “It was the sustaining practice of writing in community {{just as much as}} the activism of building a community-based reading series for writers of color that kept us engaged in collectivity." ...|$|R
