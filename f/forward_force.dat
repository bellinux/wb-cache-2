25|$|Driving an {{avalanche}} is the {{component of the}} avalanche's weight parallel to the slope; as the avalanche progresses any unstable snow in its path will tend to become incorporated, so increasing the overall weight. This force will increase as the steepness of the slope increases, and diminish as the slope flattens. Resisting this {{are a number of}} components that are thought to interact with each other: the friction between the avalanche and the surface beneath; friction between the air and snow within the fluid; fluid-dynamic drag at {{the leading edge of the}} avalanche; shear resistance between the avalanche and the air through which it is passing, and shear resistance between the fragments within the avalanche itself. An avalanche will continue to accelerate until the resistance exceeds the <b>forward</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E

50|$|As {{a hugely}} {{diverse group of}} animals, the posture adopted by theropods likely varied {{considerably}} between various lineages through time. Almost all known theropods {{are known to be}} bipedal, with the forelimbs reduced in length and specialized {{for a wide variety of}} tasks (see below). In modern birds, the body is typically held in a somewhat upright position, with the upper leg (femur) held parallel to the spine and with the <b>forward</b> <b>force</b> of locomotion generated at the knee. Scientists are not certain how far back in the theropod family tree this type of posture and locomotion extends.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the float}} relies on gravity, the chamber must be mounted vertically.

Acceleration effects may also apply a <b>forwards</b> <b>force</b> on the float and so the float hinges often have to be mounted across the car to avoid surging. Some designs, such as the Stromberg use wide, shallow floats to reduce surging.|$|R

50|$|Following {{the victory}} at Alamein, the Eighth Army {{advanced}} west through Libya to El Agheila. For {{much of this}} time, Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery, the Eighth Army commander since August 1942, was obliged to maintain a relatively small <b>forward</b> <b>force</b> because of the difficulties caused by a very extended supply line and the New Zealand Division was therefore held in reserve at Bardia. At the Battle of El Agheila, the New Zealand Division was brought forward with supporting tanks to conduct an outflanking movement while two divisions made a frontal attack. The battle started {{on the night of}} 11 December. Looking to preserve his forces, Rommel commenced a withdrawal to Buerat on the 12th.|$|E
50|$|To communicate, a Sunrunner weaves {{light and}} travels to another Sunrunner. The {{approaching}} faradhi gently brushes {{the other with}} his or her colours, so as not to intrude. The receiving faradhi usually weaves his/her own colours around the others and the two speak as their minds are essentially woven together. Powerful and/or well trained Sunrunners can also view images of memory from another's mind. In less polite circumstances they can pull memories <b>forward,</b> <b>force</b> their presence on others, and even seize minds in order to use those faradh'im 's powers to augment their own. Another person can also be used as a vessel from which a faradhi can see and hear the activity around the other person.|$|E
50|$|When braking, {{the rider}} in motion {{is seeking to}} change {{the speed of the}} {{combined}} mass m of rider plus bike. This is a negative acceleration a in the line of travel. F=ma, the acceleration a causes an inertial <b>forward</b> <b>force</b> F on mass m.The braking a is from an initial speed u to a final speed v, over a length of time t. The equation u - v = at implies that the greater the acceleration the shorter the time needed to change speed. The stopping distance s is also shortest when acceleration a is at the highest possible value compatible with road conditions: the equation s = ut + 1/2 at2 makes s low when a is high and t is low.|$|E

50|$|The {{following}} day, on September 8, {{an alternate}} Training Team, ETT 2-8, set {{out with their}} allied Afghan forces to Ganjgal. During their mission planning, it was made clear that no dedicated close air support would be available for the mission but commanders promised artillery support from nearby forward bases. In addition, ETT 2-8 was told that, in case of emergency, helicopter support could be redirected from an operation in a neighboring valley within five minutes. Initial intelligence available to the team indicated that Taliban forces {{were aware of the}} pending mission and were setting up ambush positions within the village with a <b>forward</b> <b>force</b> of at least 20 fighters. Concerned with both losing the initiative and the safety of the anti-Taliban village elders, ETT 2-8 decided to proceed with the mission and engage the Taliban forces.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the overall mass of the gun, reciprocating parts of the gun will affect how the shooter perceives recoil. While these parts {{are not part of}} the ejecta, and do not alter the overall momentum of the system, they do involve moving masses during the operation of firing. For example, gas-operated shotguns are widely held to have a [...] "softer" [...] recoil than fixed breech or recoil-operated guns. (Although many semi-automatic recoil and gas-operated guns incorporate recoil buffer systems into the stock that effectively spreads out peak felt recoil forces.) In a gas-operated gun, the bolt is accelerated rearwards by propellant gases during firing, which results in a <b>forward</b> <b>force</b> on the body of the gun. This is countered by a rearward force as the bolt reaches the limit of travel and moves forwards, resulting in a zero sum, but to the shooter, the recoil has been spread out over a longer period of time, resulting in the [...] "softer" [...] feel.|$|E
