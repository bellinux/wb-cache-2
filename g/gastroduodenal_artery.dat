40|$|ObjectivesMany pancreaticoduodenal artery (PDA) aneurysms are {{associated}} with celiac artery (CA) stenosis. The pathogenesis of PDA aneurysm {{may be associated with}} hemodynamic changes due to CA stenosis/occlusion. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the hemodynamic changes of celiaco-mesenteric anastomosis in patients with PDA aneurysms concomitant with CA occlusion using four-dimensional flow-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (4 D-Flow). Methods 4 D-Flow was performed preoperatively on five patients. Seven age- and sex-matched individuals were used as controls. Hemodynamic parameters such as flow volume and maximum flow velocity in PDAs, <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>arteries,</b> common hepatic arteries, and superior mesenteric arteries were compared between both groups. Wall shear stress (WSS) and oscillatory shear index (OSI) were mapped in both groups. ResultsIn the patient group, 4 D-Flow identified retrograde flow of both <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>arteries</b> and common hepatic arteries. Heterogeneous distribution patterns of both WSS and OSI were identified across the entire PDA in the patient group. OSI mapping showed multiple regions with extremely high OSI values (OSI > 0. 3) in all patients. All PDA aneurysms, which were surgically resected, were atherosclerotic. Conclusions 4 D-Flow identified hemodynamic changes in celiaco-mesenteric arteries in patients with PDA aneurysms with concomitant CA occlusion. These hemodynamic changes may be associated with PDA aneurysm formation...|$|R
40|$|Aneurysms are a rare {{cause of}} hemobilia. Hepatic artery {{aneurysm}} is uncommon, usually extrahepatic and seldom intrahepatic. The arteries commonly involved are {{branches of the}} hepatic or <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>arteries.</b> Rupture of the hepatic artery aneurysm into the biliary tract is a rare cause of hemobilia. Angiography is the diagnostic method of choice. Interventional angiography with embolization is optimal for intrahepatic aneurysms and poor risk patients. We report a rare case of ruptured hepatic artery aneurysm in a patient with liver metastasis that was controlled by coil embolization. Embolization with NBCA is a useful treatment for ruptured pseudoaneurysms, which are difficult to control by coil embolization alone...|$|R
2500|$|Anatomically, the {{pancreas}} {{is divided into}} the head of pancreas, the neck of pancreas, the body of pancreas, and the tail of pancreas. The head is surrounded by the duodenum in its concavity. The head surrounds two blood vessels, the superior mesenteric artery and vein. From {{the back of the}} head emerges a small uncinate process which extends to the back of the superior mesenteric vein and ends at the superior mesenteric artery. The neck is about [...] long and lies between the head and the body and in front of the superior mesenteric artery and vein. Its front upper surface supports the pylorus (the base) of the stomach. The neck arises from the left upper part of the front of the head. It is directed first upward and forward, and then upward and to the left to join the body; it is somewhat flattened from above downward and backward. On the right it is grooved by the <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>artery.</b> The body is the largest part of {{the pancreas}} and lies behind the pylorus, at the same level as the transpyloric plane. The tail ends by abutting the spleen.|$|E

A 26 -year-old {{man with}} a medical history significant for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) presented with hypovolemic shock secondary to large volume hematemesis. The patient was diagnosed with ALL and treated with high dose chemotherapy followed by peripheral blood stem cell transplant from a matched unrelated donor one year prior to presentation. His treatment course was complicated by grade 4 acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) and CMV colitis. Blood work on admission showed hemoglobin of 6. 4 g/dL and a leukocytosis. Patient was intubated for airway protection, transferred to ICU, and EGD was performed, which revealed diffusely friable mucosa, inflammation, and ulcerations throughout the gastric mucosa {{with only a few}} areas of normal appearing mucosa. Additionally, areas of spontaneous bleeding were seen.

40|$|We {{present the}} case of a distal {{anterior}} inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) aneurysm masquerading as a cerebellopontine angle tumor in a 60 -year-old right-handed man with previously undiagnosed polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). The patient presented with a 2 -month history of progressive right-sided hearing loss, intermittent severe headache, and sudden onset of complete facial paralysis 3 weeks before admission. Magnetic resonance imaging, including postgadolinium images, showed a 1. 2 -cm heterogenously enhancing mass that slightly enlarged the right internal auditory canal. A right suboccipital craniotomy was performed, and a partially thrombosed fusiform AICA aneurysm was discovered just anterior to the VII/VIII nerve complex. The aneurysm was trapped and opened, and a thrombectomy was performed. Postoperatively, the patient experienced abdominal pain; liver function tests were abnormal. Investigation revealed a small retroperitoneal hemorrhage and aneurysms of the celiac axis and <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>arteries.</b> Further investigation revealed an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a diagnosis of PAN was made. PAN is a well-identified factor in the genesis of peripheral vascular aneurysms. Aneurysms involving the hepatic, renal, coronary, pancreatic, and tibial arteries have been described. PAN is an extremely rare cause of intracranial aneurysm. Patients who present with aneurysms in unusual locations (e. g., distal AICA) should be investigated for vasculopathy and collagen vascular disorders...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} case of a 45 -year-old man, who {{presented}} to his local casualty department with severe epigastric pain following an alcohol binge, and was subsequently diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. Pancreatic necrosis with multiple collections ensued, necessitating transfer to an intensive care unit (ITU) in a tertiary hepatopancreaticobiliary centre. Initially, the patient appeared to slowly improve and was discharged to the ward, albeit following a prolonged ITU admission. However, during his subsequent recovery, he suffered multiple episodes of haematemesis and melaena associated with haemodynamic instability and requiring repeat admission to the ITU. Computerised tomographic angiography, followed by visceral angiography, was used to confirm the diagnosis of multisite visceral artery pseudoaneurysms, secondary to severe, necrotising pancreatitis. Pseudoaneurysms of the splenic, left colic and <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>arteries</b> were sequentially, and successfully, radiologically embolised over a period of 9 days. Subsequent sequelae of radiological embolisation included a clinically insignificant splenic infarct, and a left colonic infarction associated with subsequent enterocutaneous fistula formation. The patient made a prolonged, but successful, recovery and was discharged from hospital after 260 days as an in-patient. This case illustrates the rare complication of three separate pseudoaneurysms, secondary to acute pancreatitis, successfully managed radiologically in the same patient. This case also highlights the necessity for multidisciplinary involvement in the management of pseudoaneurysms, an approach that is often most successfully achieved in a tertiary setting...|$|R

40|$|Aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} treatment efficacy and safety of a scaled-up version of our porcine hepatocytes based BAL system in pigs with complete liver ischemia (LIS). Thirty-one pigs underwent total devascularization of the liver (LIS) by termino-lateral porta-caval shunts and sutures around the bile duct, the common hepatic and <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>arteries</b> and their accessory branches. The hepato-duodenal ligament was completely transected. Four experimental groups were studied: the first control group (LIS Control, n = 10) received glucose infusion only, the second control group (LIS Plasmapheresis, n = 8) was connected to a centrifugal plasma-separator with a bottle representing the bioreactor volume, the third control group (LIS Empty-BAL, n = 5) received BAL treatment without cells, and the treated group (LIS Cell-BAL, n = 8) was connected for a maximum period of 24 hours to our scaled-up BAL seeded with around 14 billion viable primary porcine hepatocytes. BAL treatment significantly prolonged life in large animals (approximately 35 kg) with complete LIS (Controls, mean +/- SEM: 33. 1 +/- 3 h, Cell-BAL: 51. 1 +/- 3. 4 h; p = 0. 001; longest survivor 63 h). In addition, blood ammonia and total bilirubin levels decreased significantly, indicating metabolic activity of porcine hepatocytes in the bioreactor. No significant differences were noticed among the three control groups, indicating that there was no device effect and that the plasmapheresis procedure was well tolerated. No important adverse effects were observe...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveVisceral artery {{aneurysm}}s may {{be treated}} by aneurysm exclusion, excision, revascularization, and endovascular techniques. The {{purpose of this study}} was to review the outcomes of the management of visceral artery aneurysms with catheter-based techniques. MethodsBetween 1997 and 2005, 90 patients were identified with a diagnosis of visceral artery aneurysm. This was inclusive of aneurysmal disease of the celiac axis, superior mesenteric artery (SMA), inferior mesenteric artery, and their branches. Surveillance without intervention occurred in 23 patients, and 19 patients underwent open aneurysm repair (4 ruptures). The endovascular treatment of 48 consecutive patients (mean age 58, 60 % men) with 20 visceral artery aneurysms (VAA) and 28 visceral artery pseudoaneurysms (VAPA) was the basis for this study. Electronic and hardcopy medical records were reviewed for demographic data and clinical variables. Original computed tomography (CT) scans and fluoroscopic imaging were evaluated. ResultsThe endovascular treatment of visceral artery aneurysms was technically successful in 98 % of 48 procedures, consisting of 3 celiac axis repairs, 2 left gastric arteries, 1 SMA, 12 hepatic arteries, 20 splenic <b>arteries,</b> 7 <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>arteries,</b> 1 middle colic artery, and 2 pancreaticoduodenal arteries. Of these, 29 (60 %) were performed for symptomatic disease (5 ruptured aneurysms). Procedures were performed in the endovascular suite under local anesthesia with conscious sedation (94 %). The femoral artery was used as the preferential access site (90 %). Coil embolization was used for aneurysm exclusion in 96 %. N-butyl- 2 -cyanoacrylate (glue) was used selectively (19 %) using a triaxial system with a 3 F microcatheter for persistent flow or multiple branches. The 30 -day mortality was 8. 3 % (n = 4). One patient died from recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding after gastroduodenal embolization, and the remaining died of unrelated causes. All perioperative deaths occurred in patients requiring urgent or emergent intervention in the setting of hemodynamic instability. No patients undergoing elective intervention died in the periprocedural period. Postprocedural imaging was performed after 77 % of interventions at a mean of 16 months. Complete exclusion of flow within the aneurysm sac occurred in 97 % interventions with follow-up imaging, but coil and glue artifact complicated CT evaluation. Postembolization syndrome developed in three patients (6 %) after splenic artery embolization. There was no evidence of hepatic insufficiency or bowel ischemia after either hepatic or mesenteric artery aneurysm treatment. Three patients required secondary interventions for persistent flow (n = 1) and recurrent bleeding from previously embolized aneurysms (n = 2). ConclusionVisceral artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms can be successfully treated with endovascular means with low periprocedural morbidity; however, the urgent repair of these lesions is still associated with elevated mortality rates. Aneurysm exclusion can be accomplished with coil embolization and the selective use of N-butyl- 2 -cyanoacrylate. Current catheter-based techniques extend our ability to exclude visceral artery aneurysms, but imaging artifact hampers postoperative CT surveillance...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRupture of pseudoaneurysms is rare {{but can be}} {{life-threatening}} {{complications of}} acute or chronic pancreatitis, usually due to enzymatic digestion of vessel walls crossing peripancreatic fluid collections. We report {{the case of a}} 40 year-old female, with multisystemic lupus and anticoagulated for prior thrombotic events, admitted for probable cyclosporine-induced acute pancreatitis. Hemodynamic instability occurred due to abdominal hemorrhage from two pseudoaneurysms inside an acute peri-pancreatic collection. Selective angiography successfully embolized the <b>gastroduodenal</b> and pancreatoduodenal <b>arteries.</b> The hemorrhage recurred two weeks later and another successful embolization was performed and the patient remains well to date. The decision to restart anticoagulants and to suspend cyclosporine was challenging and required a multidisciplinary approach. Despite rare, bleeding from a pseudoaneurysm should be considered when facing a patient with pancreatitis and sudden signs of hemodynamic instability...|$|R
50|$|The minor {{duodenal}} papilla {{is contained}} within {{the second part of}} the duodenum. It is situated 2 cm proximal to the major duodenal papilla, and thus 5-8 cm from the opening of the pylorus. The <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>artery</b> lies posterior.|$|E
50|$|The {{duodenum}} receives {{arterial blood}} {{from two different}} sources. The transition between these sources is important as it demarcates the foregut from the midgut. Proximal to the 2nd part of the duodenum (approximately at the major duodenal papilla - where the bile duct enters) the arterial supply is from the <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>artery</b> and its branch the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery. Distal to this point (the midgut) the arterial supply is from the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), and its branch the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery supplies the 3rd and 4th sections.The superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries (from the <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>artery</b> and SMA respectively) form an anastomotic loop between the celiac trunk and the SMA; so there is potential for collateral circulation here.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{a branch}} of the <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>artery,</b> which most {{commonly}} arises from the common hepatic artery of the celiac trunk, although there are numerous variations of the origin of the <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>artery</b> [...] ). The pancreaticoduodenal artery divides into two branches as it descends, an anterior and posterior branch. These branches then travel around the head of the pancreas and duodenum, eventually joining with the anterior and posterior branches of the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery. The inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery is {{a branch of}} the superior mesenteric artery. These arteries, together with the pancreatic branches of the splenic artery, form connections or anastomoses with one another, allowing blood to perfuse the pancreas and duodenum through multiple channels.|$|E
40|$|A thoracic-aorta-left renal artery bypass with {{polytetrafluoroethylene}} (PTFE) {{and three}} <b>gastroduodenal</b> right renal <b>artery</b> bypasses were constructed in four patients in whom loss of renal function {{and the potential}} for dialysis were imminent. These extraanatomic bypasses showed durable patency with preservation of renal function. Gastroduodenal-renal bypass requires an appreciation of the anatomic relationship of the right renal artery to the right renal vein. Anatomic studies were performed in 80 human cadavers to assess the anatomic relationships of the right renal artery with respect to the right renal vein. In 50 % of the cadavers studied, the right renal artery was superior to the right renal vein. It was located inferior to the right renal vein in 17. 5 % and directly posterior in 32. 5 %. Extraanatomic bypasses may be required for treatment of renal hypertension or parenchymal salvage. Gastroduodenal-renal and thoracorenal reconstructions are unusual variants of extraanatomic bypasses, and though uncommonly required, may be extremely useful methods to employ for renal revascularization...|$|R
50|$|A {{considerable}} plexus {{accompanies the}} <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>artery</b> and is continued as the inferior gastric plexus {{on the right}} gastroepiploic artery along the greater curvature of the stomach, where it unites with offshoots from the lienal plexus. Cystic plexus is the derivation of hepatic plexus.|$|E
50|$|In anatomy, the <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>artery</b> {{is a small}} {{blood vessel}} in the abdomen. It {{supplies}} blood directly to the pylorus (distal part of the stomach) and proximal part of the duodenum, and indirectly to the pancreatic head (via the anterior and posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal arteries).|$|E
50|$|The gastroepiploic arteries are arteries {{that supply}} oxygenated {{blood to the}} stomach. The right gastroepiploic artery arises when the <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>artery</b> bifurcates.

(b) subpyloric, {{four or five}} in number, {{in close}} {{relation}} to the bifurcation of the <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>artery,</b> in the angle between the superior and descending parts of the duodenum; an outlying member of this group is sometimes found above the duodenum on the right gastric (pyloric) artery.|$|E
50|$|The right gastroepiploic artery (or right gastro-omental artery) {{is one of}} the two {{terminal}} {{branches of}} the <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>artery.</b> It runs from right to left along the greater curvature of the stomach, between the layers of the greater omentum, anastomosing with the left gastroepiploic artery, a branch of the splenic artery.|$|E
5000|$|The deep branch {{consistently}} {{arises from}} the right hepatic artery which is generally also the source of origin of the superficial branch, however {{in some cases it}} has been found to initiate from the anterior segmental artery, middle hepatic artery, left hepatic artery, superior mesenteric artery, <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>artery</b> or retroduodenal artery.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that the}} {{branches}} of the splenic artery do not reach {{all the way to the}} lower part of the greater curvature of the stomach. Instead, that region is supplied by the right gastroepiploic artery, a branch of the <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>artery.</b> The two gastroepiploic arteries anastomose with each other at that point.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>artery</b> {{is a small}} {{blood vessel}} in the abdomen. It {{supplies}} blood to the pylorus, a distal part of the stomach, and the proximal part of the duodenum. It arises from the common hepatic artery and terminates in a , when it splits into the right gastro-omental artery and the anterior superior pancreaticoduodenal artery.|$|E
50|$|The {{basic concept}} behind the pancreaticoduodenectomy {{is that the}} head of the {{pancreas}} and the duodenum share the same arterial blood supply (the <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>artery).</b> These arteries run through the head of the pancreas, so that both organs must be removed if the single blood supply is severed. If only the head of the pancreas were removed it would compromise blood flow to the duodenum, resulting in tissue necrosis.|$|E
50|$|The <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>artery</b> can be {{the source}} of a {{significant}} gastrointestinal bleed, which may arise as a complication of peptic ulcer disease.Because of its close relationship to the posteromedial wall of {{the second part of the}} duodenum, deeply penetrating ulcers or tumours of the duodenum may cause torrential bleeding from the gastroduodenal ‘artery of haemorrhage', not least because of the profuse arterial network in the region ensures a high flow rate in the vessel.|$|E
50|$|The {{duodenal}} bulb is {{the portion}} of the duodenum which is closest to the stomach. It normally has a length of about 5 centimeters. The duodenal bulb begins at the pylorus and ends at the neck of the gallbladder. It is located posterior to the liver and the gallbladder, and superior to the pancreatic head. The <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>artery,</b> portal vein, and common bile duct lie just behind it. The distal part of the bulb is located retroperitoneally. It abuts the Pyloric sphincter.|$|E
50|$|The {{right and}} left gastroepiploic arteries provide the sole blood supply to the greater omentum. Both are {{branches}} of the celiac trunk. The right gastroepiploic artery is {{a branch of the}} <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>artery,</b> which is a branch of the common hepatic artery, which is a branch of the celiac trunk. The left gastroepiploic artery is the largest branch of the splenic artery, which is a branch of the celiac trunk. The {{right and left}} gastroepiploic arteries anastomose within the two layers of the anterior greater omentum along the greater curvature of the stomach.|$|E
50|$|The {{duodenal}} bulb is {{the place}} where duodenal ulcers occur. Duodenal ulcers are more common than gastric ulcers and, unlike gastric ulcers, are caused by increased gastric acid secretion. Duodenal ulcers are commonly located anteriorly, and rarely posteriorly. Anterior ulcers can be complicated by perforation, while the posterior ones bleed. The reason for that is explained by their location. The peritoneal or abdominal cavity is located anterior to the duodenum. Therefore, if the ulcer grows deep enough, it will perforate; whereas if a posterior ulcer grows deep enough, it will perforate the <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>artery</b> and bleed.|$|E
50|$|Perforation (a hole in {{the wall}} of the {{gastrointestinal}} tract) often leads to catastrophic consequences if left untreated. Erosion of the gastro-intestinal wall by the ulcer leads to spillage of the stomach or intestinal content into the abdominal cavity. Perforation at the anterior surface of the stomach leads to acute peritonitis, initially chemical and later bacterial peritonitis. The first sign is often sudden intense abdominal pain; an example is Valentino's syndrome, named after the silent-film actor who experienced this pain before his death. Posterior wall perforation leads to bleeding due to the involvement of <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>artery</b> that lies posterior to {{the first part of the}} duodenum.|$|E
