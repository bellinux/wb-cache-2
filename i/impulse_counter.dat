40|$|Latest related {{research}} shows natural polyisoprene – nanostructured carbon composite (PNCC) as a promising piezoresistive material for soft pressure sensors. The main advantages of PNCC over conventional sensors are exceptional sensitivity in finger pressure range and possibility to be embedded into soft structures. The current PNCC {{can be made}} when certain amount (usually percolative concentration) of high structure electroconductive filler is dispersed into elastomer matrix and vulcanized afterwards. In this work we specify the percolation threshold for natural polyisoprene rubber filled with Degussa Printex XE 2 extra electro-conductive high structure (nanostructured) carbon black, depending on methods of dispersing. After obtaining optimal composition we present a completely soft PNCC pressure sensor prototype, made using multi-gradient approach, when elementary layers with different filler concentration are cured together and forms uniform sensor body with integrated soft electrodes. Afterwards we couple it with simplified analog <b>impulse</b> <b>counter.</b> The prototype system elaborated {{could be used for}} counting of interface events between sensor and external environmental factor. If multiple sensor grid approach is used, it could be possible to estimate the distribution and intensity of the external pressure on soft, flat-like surface. These results could be evaluated as a step towards the artificial skin, capable to sense non-destructive interface of the external structure...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the manipulation of a virtual character using real-time movement of 6 -degree-of-freedom controllers. To this end, several Jacobian-based IK methods were implemented, which use an approximation of the inverse of the Jacobian matrix to calculate changes in DOF values {{that will lead to}} the desired position and orientation of the end effector (the last link in the joint chain representing the arm). These methods include the Jacobian Tranpose, Jacobian Pseudoinverse, and Damped Least Squares. Joint limits are enforced through clamping of orientation, as well as the temporary removal of some of the joint's degrees of freedom. Collisions are handled within the Jacobian matrix itself by adding additional effectors for each contact, with a correctional <b>impulse</b> <b>counter</b> to the contact's direction and magnitude based on contact depth. A weight-based approach is used to handle priority of the constraints, those being the end effector's position, its rotation, and contact constraints. The ?final solution is a set of joint angle changes for each frame in the simulation that should result in a realistic motion closely approximating the actual controller's movement, while taking collision constraints into account. The context of the implementation of these techniques is the BirthPlay application, which simulates uncommon or difficult birth operations to train obstetricians in the proper procedures. The implementation produces good solutions for basic inverse kinematics problems, but the collision response method results in extremely slow convergence for configurations with contacts...|$|E
50|$|Free will is {{fundamental}} to Recovery's method. The subconscious, {{as it is known}} in psychoanalysis, as well as viewpoints emphasizing unconscious motivations, drives, and instincts are considered to be self-defeating. Recovery considers adults as capable of behaving based on deliberate plans, settled decisions, reasoned conclusions and firm determinations. Will gives adults the ability to accept or reject thoughts and impulses. Recovery members achieve mental health by training their Wills to reject self-defeating thoughts and <b>impulses,</b> <b>countering</b> them with self-endorsing thoughts and wellness-promoting actions.|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of electrical stress of polluted outdoor insulators {{was carried out}} at the field test station located at a copper smelting plant Głogów in 1987 and 2002. Leakage current and flashover voltages were recorded on porcelain long rods of different types. A simple <b>impulse</b> <b>counters</b> having three different trigger levels were used for current measurements. The special fuses with an explosion mixture were applied for detection of flashovers. Additionally, the measurements of ESDD on insulator surface or dust deposition density were carried out. During last ten years the industry dust emission in Middle Europe decreased considerably due to progress in environmental protection. Therefore the similar measurements were repeated with the aim to asses {{the current state of}} electrical stress of outdoor insulators...|$|R

40|$|Credit risk is {{influenced}} by interest rates and market liquidity. This paper examines the direct and indirect impacts of unexpected monetary policy shifts on the growth of corporate credit risk, {{with the aim of}} quantifying the size and direction of the response. The results surprisingly indicate that monetary policy and liquidity <b>impulses</b> move <b>counter</b> to each other in their effects on credit risk ("The monetary policy-liquidity paradox"). The analysis indicates that while contractionary monetary policy creates tight money which subsequently leads to a slowing in the growth of credit risk and a reduction of liquidity in credit markets, reduced liquidity indirectly affects credit risk by accelerating its growth. The net effect of these transitory opposing forces generates the final impact on credit risk. An unexpected policy shifts is captured via a combination of the forward Fed fund rate curve and the Fed's FOMC policy announcements. Following the approach of Bernanke and Kuttner (2005), Hausman and Wongswan (2006) who examined asset prices under FOMC announcements, the study found that the estimated credit risk responses to FOMC announcements vary across credit qualities. Hence the analyses indicates that a typical unanticipated 25 basis point cut in the target fed funds rate generally resulted in an acceleration in the growth of credit risk by 0. 50 percent for AAA rated corporate grade debt, and by 3. 5 percent for BB rated corporate debt. Moreover, the study found a direct effect of the FOMC's policy instrument on market liquidity which had a significant effect on the growth in credit risk. The results indicate that a 1 percentage point increase in liquidity for AAA and CCC rated bonds resulted in a 0. 7 % and 52. 45 % decrease in the rate of growth in credit risk respectively.

6000|$|And {{while he}} talked, the girl {{looked at him}} with startled eyes. His fire warmed her. She {{wondered}} if she had been cold all her days. She wanted to lean toward this burning, blazing man that was like a volcano spouting forth strength, robustness, and health. She felt that she must lean toward him, and resisted by an effort. Then, too, there was the <b>counter</b> <b>impulse</b> to shrink away from him. She was repelled by those lacerated hands, grimed by toil so that the very dirt of life was ingrained in the flesh itself, by that red chafe of the collar and those bulging muscles. His roughness frightened her; each roughness of speech was an insult to her ear, each rough phase of his life an insult to her soul. And ever and again would come the draw of him, till she thought he must be evil to have such power over her. All that was most firmly established in her mind was rocking. His romance and adventure were battering at the conventions. Before his facile perils and ready laugh, life was no longer an affair of serious effort and restraint, but a toy, to be played with and turned topsy-turvy, carelessly to be lived and pleasured in, and carelessly to be flung aside. [...] "Therefore, play!" [...] was the cry that rang through her. [...] "Lean toward him, if so you will, and place your two hands upon his neck!" [...] She wanted to cry out at the recklessness of the thought, and in vain she appraised her own cleanness and culture and balanced all that she was against what he was not. She glanced about her and saw the others gazing at him with rapt attention; and she would have despaired had not she seen horror in her mother's eyes--fascinated horror, it was true, but none the less horror. This man from outer darkness was evil. Her mother saw it, and her mother was right. She would trust her mother's judgment in this as she had always trusted it in all things. The fire of him was no longer warm, and the fear of him was no longer poignant.|$|R
