5|$|Despite the dissatisfaction of most {{physicists}} with Fresnel's partial aether-dragging hypothesis, repetitions {{and improvements}} to his experiment (see sections above) by others confirmed <b>his</b> <b>results</b> to high accuracy.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to Harvard {{in the fall}} of 1952, and soon after published the most important of <b>his</b> <b>results</b> on Hilbert's fifth problem (see below).|$|E
5|$|While {{still in}} Madras, Ramanujan {{recorded}} {{the bulk of}} <b>his</b> <b>results</b> in four notebooks of loose-leaf paper. They were mostly written up without any derivations. This is probably {{the origin of the}} misapprehension that Ramanujan was unable to prove <b>his</b> <b>results</b> and simply thought up the final result directly. Mathematician Bruce C. Berndt, in his review of these notebooks and Ramanujan's work, says that Ramanujan most certainly was able to prove most of <b>his</b> <b>results,</b> but chose not to.|$|E

5|$|After {{losing the}} title, Steinitz played in tournaments more {{frequently}} than he had previously. He won at New York 1894, and was fifth at Hastings 1895 (winning the first brilliancy prize for his game with Curt von Bardeleben). At Saint Petersburg 1895, a super-strong four player, multi-round-robin event, with Lasker, Chigorin and Pillsbury, he took second place. Later <b>his</b> <b>results</b> began to decline: 6th in Nuremberg 1896, 5th in Cologne 1898, 10th in London 1899.|$|E
5|$|Andrés Silva (Uruguay), {{who ran the}} 400 metres hurdles on July 22/23, was {{reported}} on August 19 to have tested positive for a prohibited substance in a doping control conducted by the Uruguayan anti-doping agency on June 2. If found to have committed an anti-doping rule violation, <b>his</b> <b>results</b> from the Pan American Games {{are likely to be}} disqualified.|$|E
5|$|Being very small, {{and unknown}} until the {{invention}} of the microscope, microbes do not feature directly in art or literature before Early Modern times (though they appear indirectly in works about brewing and baking), when Antonie van Leeuwenhoek observed microbes in water in 1676; <b>his</b> <b>results</b> were soon confirmed by Robert Hooke. A few major diseases such as tuberculosis appear in literature, art, film, opera and music.|$|E

5|$|Building on <b>his</b> <b>results</b> on matrix {{games and}} on his model of an {{expanding}} economy, von Neumann invented the theory of duality in linear programming, after George Dantzig described his work in a few minutes, when an impatient von Neumann asked him {{to get to the}} point. Then, Dantzig listened dumbfounded while von Neumann provided an hour lecture on convex sets, fixed-point theory, and duality, conjecturing the equivalence between matrix games and linear programming.|$|E
5|$|Fischer {{gained a}} far higher rating than any player in history {{up to that}} time. On the July 1972 FIDE rating list, his Elo rating of 2785 was 125 points above (World No. 2) Spassky's rating of 2660. <b>His</b> <b>results</b> {{put him on the}} cover of Life magazine, and allowed him to {{challenge}} World Champion Boris Spassky, whom he had never beaten (+0−3=2).|$|E

5|$|In 2006, Marcelo Weksler {{published}} a large-scale cladistic analysis of Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), the group (tribe) to which hammondi {{and the related}} species mentioned above belong. He used both morphological and molecular characters, but had only morphological data for Oryzomys hammondi. The placement of the species in <b>his</b> <b>results</b> was unstable; some trees placed it close to the tree rice rats, Oecomys, within clade B and others placed it as an isolated lineage, basal to all other Oryzomyini.|$|E
5|$|In February 2012, the Court of Arbitration for Sport {{decided that}} Contador, {{following}} his positive test for clenbuterol at the 2010 Tour de France, lost <b>his</b> <b>results</b> since that event. He was therefore stripped of the 2011 Giro title, and Scarponi became the new victor of the race, {{and the winner}} of the points classification.|$|E
5|$|Löwig {{isolated}} bromine from {{a mineral}} water spring from his hometown Bad Kreuznach in 1825. Löwig used {{a solution of}} the mineral salt saturated with chlorine and extracted the bromine with diethyl ether. After evaporation of the ether a brown liquid remained. With this liquid as a sample of his work he applied for {{a position in the}} laboratory of Leopold Gmelin in Heidelberg. The publication of the results was delayed and Balard published <b>his</b> <b>results</b> first.|$|E

5|$|Since Fischer had {{completed}} {{fewer than half}} of his scheduled games, all of <b>his</b> <b>results</b> were annulled, meaning players who had played Fischer had those games cancelled, and the scores nullified from the official tournament record.|$|E
5|$|The first archaeological {{investigation}} of Monte Testaccio began in January 1872 under the German archaeologist Heinrich Dressel, who published <b>his</b> <b>results</b> in a pioneering study in 1878. Further important work {{was carried out}} in the 1980s by the Spanish archaeologists Emilio Rodríguez Almeida and José Remesal Almeida.|$|E
5|$|A. Alberto Contador was {{the winner}} at the podium {{ceremony}} in Milan {{on the last day}} of the 2011 Giro d'Italia, but was subsequently found to have tested positive for performing-enhancing drugs on a rest day in the 2010 Tour de France. He was originally suspended on 25 January 2011 for a year, but appealed the decision. The Court of Arbitration for Sport found him guilty of using clenbuterol during the race; thus <b>his</b> <b>results</b> since the 2010 Tour de France were taken away from him and he was stripped of the win on 6 February 2012.|$|E
30|$|Five {{years later}} in 1999 Kedlaya [23] {{improved}} <b>his</b> <b>result</b> to a weighted setting. In more detail, he showed the following.|$|R

50|$|Smith {{competed in}} seven Oceania Chess Championships between 2000 and 2012. <b>His</b> best <b>result</b> was in Fiji 2007, when he scored 6.5/9, earning an IM norm result, and {{finished}} equal second with Puchen Wang and Igor Goldenberg. Puchen Wang {{was awarded the}} IM title for <b>his</b> <b>result,</b> on tiebreak.|$|R
5|$|According to the {{theories}} prevailing at the time, light traveling through a moving medium would be dragged {{along by the}} medium, so that the measured speed of the light would be a simple sum of its speed through the medium plus {{the speed of the}} medium. Fizeau indeed detected a dragging effect, but the magnitude of the effect that he observed was far lower than expected. <b>His</b> <b>results</b> seemingly supported the partial aether-drag hypothesis of Fresnel, a situation that was disconcerting to most physicists. Over half a century passed before a satisfactory explanation of Fizeau's unexpected measurement was developed with the advent of Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. Einstein later pointed out the importance of the experiment for special relativity, in which it corresponds to the relativistic velocity-addition formula when restricted to small velocities.|$|E
5|$|After his {{accidental}} discovery, Reinitzer did {{not pursue}} studying liquid crystals further. The research was continued by Lehmann, who {{realized that he}} had encountered a new phenomenon and {{was in a position to}} investigate it: In his postdoctoral years he had acquired expertise in crystallography and microscopy. Lehmann started a systematic study, first of cholesteryl benzoate, and then of related compounds which exhibited the double-melting phenomenon. He was able to make observations in polarized light, and his microscope was equipped with a hot stage (sample holder equipped with a heater) enabling high temperature observations. The intermediate cloudy phase clearly sustained flow, but other features, particularly the signature under a microscope, convinced Lehmann that he was dealing with a solid. By the end of August 1889 he had published <b>his</b> <b>results</b> in the Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} switch of coaches, Thorpe {{indicated}} that he would put more focus on improving his sprinting ability. He thus dropped the 800m freestyle despite being the reigning world champion and record holder. During this period, his times in the 400m and 200m freestyle deteriorated, and both he and Menzies were criticised. The criticism continued to mount during their partnership, particularly during the build-up to the 2004 Olympics. Following his victory in the 200 and 400 events in Athens, Thorpe said that <b>his</b> <b>results</b> justified his decision, despite posting substantially faster times as a young swimmer under Frost.|$|E
50|$|In {{the ancient}} pentathlon contest he {{finished}} 16th {{and he also}} participated in the discus throw event but <b>his</b> <b>result</b> is unknown.|$|R
