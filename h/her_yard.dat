25|$|Two {{months before}} she was killed, some police {{officers}} had allegedly cut and took away a Margosa tree from <b>her</b> <b>yard.</b> Although she {{is reported to have}} {{filed a complaint with the}} officer in charge at Central Camp immediately, nothing was done. Subsequently, Mrs. Koneswary complained to a deputy inspector general in Ampara, who intervened on her behalf, and instructed the local police to return the timber to the family. It was after this incident that the alleged verbal abuse and sexual harassment of Mrs. Koneswary began.|$|E
25|$|One {{day after}} school, {{a young girl}} named Kilala Reno stumbles across a boy {{sleeping}} in <b>her</b> <b>yard.</b> After thinking to herself {{he looks like a}} Prince, she tries to kiss him, thinking it will wake him up, just like a kiss wakes up Sleeping Beauty. He does wake but only to fall back asleep again. Kilala then carries him inside her house and watches over him sleeping as she wonders who he is and where he came from. As she's folding his coat, a small tiara falls out, which she tries on. To her surprise, she feels just like one of the Disney Princesses. Then, Rei wakes up and accuses her of stealing the tiara. She calls him the Thief instead, questioning how she would know if he didn't steal it first. Rei's servant, Valdou, runs in and unintentionally breaks up the fight.|$|E

60|$|The little Parki's toilet being thus {{thoroughly}} {{made for}} the first time since the massacre, we gave her new raiment to the breeze, and daintily squaring <b>her</b> <b>yards,</b> she gracefully glided away; honest old Jarl at the helm, watchfully guiding her path, like some devoted old foster-father.|$|R
2500|$|The keel {{of the new}} ship, {{referred}} to by <b>her</b> <b>yard</b> number as NB 1369, was laid down on 31 January 2011. She was launched on 21 July 2011 and named S. A. Agulhas II. S. A. Agulhas II conducted her open water sea trials in February 2012 and, in order to verify the results of model tests, ice trials in the Bay of Bothnia between 19 and 24 March. During the latter voyage the ship encountered level ice up to [...] thick and performed beyond expectations. In addition the hull and machinery of the vessel were instrumented to measure full-scale ice loads, {{and in the future}} S. A. Agulhas II will be used as a research platform by companies and universities from Finland and South Africa to gain more knowledge about the interaction between ice and the ship.|$|E
60|$|And the {{man went}} on. Mrs. Dakin, going up <b>her</b> <b>yard,</b> spied Mrs. Morel taking the ashes to the ash-pit.|$|E
6000|$|... "'I'm real {{glad to see}} you,' {{she said}} briskly, when I landed in <b>her</b> <b>yard.</b> 'My, you don't look a mite like I expected. I was sure you'd be dark--my sister Anne was dark. And here you're redheaded!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{the same}} time," [...] Frank went on, [...] "we have {{an object in}} view. Just at present {{we want to find}} that {{schooner}} or brigantine that put in here nearly a month ago. She carried a heavy spread of canvas on <b>her</b> <b>yards,</b> and lay very low in the water." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought as}} much, sir, from your ground hamper and top-tackles," [...] added the relict smiling. [...] "For my part {{there is nothing}} in nature that I so much admire as a full jiggered ship, with her canvas out of the bolt-ropes, and her clew-lines and clew-garnets braced sharp, and <b>her</b> <b>yards</b> all abroad." ...|$|R

60|$|Hose {{was coming}} along, ringing his bell. Women were {{waiting at the}} yard-ends with their seamed {{stockings}} hanging over their arms. The man, a common fellow, made jokes with them, tried to swindle them, and bullied them. Mrs. Morel went up <b>her</b> <b>yard</b> disdainfully.|$|E
6000|$|And when Milt wasn't unromantically {{thinking}} of his cold back, he exulted. [...] "She won't be back among her own folks till Seattle. Probably forget me then. Don't blame her. But till we get there, she'll let me play in <b>her</b> <b>yard.</b> Gee! In the morning I'll be talking to her again, and she's right there, right now!" ...|$|E
60|$|Helen gazed in perplexity at {{this strange}} man. She {{did not know}} how to explain it; she was irritated, but did her best to conceal it. He had no {{interest}} in her, yet had hidden under the lilacs in <b>her</b> <b>yard.</b> She was grateful because he had saved her from annoyance, yet could not fathom his reason for being so near.|$|E
60|$|Soon the {{two ships}} diverged their wakes; and {{long as the}} strange vessel was in view, she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot, however small, on the sea. This way and that <b>her</b> <b>yards</b> were swung around; {{starboard}} and larboard, she continued to tack; now she beat against a head sea; and again it pushed her before it; while all the while, <b>her</b> masts and <b>yards</b> were thickly clustered with men, as three tall cherry trees, when the boys are cherrying among the boughs.|$|R

60|$|We ate a {{good many}} young roosters that fall, for Euphemia would not allow all the {{products}} of <b>her</b> <b>yard</b> to go to market, and, also, a great many eggs and fowls were sold. She had not contented herself with her original stock of poultry, but had bought fowls during the winter, and she certainly had extraordinary good luck, or else her extraordinary system worked extraordinarily well.|$|E
60|$|Then a year, and David's father died. The {{sheep and}} the cottage descended to him. He {{already had the}} seemliest wife in the village. Yvonne's milk pails and her brass kettles were bright--ouf! they blinded you in the sun when you passed that way. But you must keep your eyes upon <b>her</b> <b>yard,</b> for her flower beds were so neat and gay they {{restored}} to you your sight. And you might hear her sing, aye, {{as far as the}} double chestnut tree above PÃ¨re Gruneau's blacksmith forge.|$|E
6000|$|Father {{swung his}} shapeless pack from his shoulders, {{set it down}} on the ground, reluctantly drew his mouth-organ from its case. He became aware that a large, {{astonished}} woman was staring from the kitchen window. He stared back. The mouth-organ was left suspended in air. Hastily he stuck it in his pocket and, as though hypnotized, moved toward the kitchen door. He had to give the woman some explanation for encamping in <b>her</b> <b>yard....</b> Why! She might have thought that he had intended to make a fool of himself by playing the mouth-organ there! ...|$|E
60|$|The frigate {{was on an}} easy bow-line, or, {{to speak}} more correctly, was {{standing}} directly across our fore-foot, with <b>her</b> <b>yards</b> nearly square. In a very few minutes, each keeping her present course, the two ships would have passed within pistol-shot of each other. I scarce knew {{the nature of the}} sudden impulse which induced me to call out to the man at the wheel to starboard his helm. It was probably from instinctive apprehension that it were better for a neutral to have as little to do with a belligerent as possible, mingled with a presentiment that I might lose some of my people by impressment. Call out I certainly did, and the Dawn's bows came up to the wind, looking to the westward, or in a direction contrary to that in which the frigate was running, as <b>her</b> <b>yards</b> were square, or nearly so. As soon as the weather leeches touched, the helm was righted, and away we went with the wind abeam, with about as much breeze as we wanted for the sail we carried.|$|R
6000|$|... "It may be well to {{make certain}} of that fact. You are right," [...] he continued, after taking a look himself at the {{approaching}} cloud of canvas; [...] "you are very right. As yet we are not seen. Forward there! haul down that head stay-sail; we will steady the ship by <b>her</b> <b>yards.</b> Now let him look with all his eyes; they must be good to see these naked spars at such a distance." ...|$|R

6000|$|For it may {{be remembered}} that the {{principle}} underlying Euphemia's management of her poultry was what might be designated as the [...] "cumulative hatch." [...] That is, she wished every chicken hatched in <b>her</b> <b>yard</b> to become {{the mother of a}} brood of her own during the year, and every one of this brood to raise another brood the next year, and so on, in a kind of geometrical progression. This plan called for a great many mother-fowls, and so Euphemia based her highest hopes on a great annual preponderance of hens.|$|E
60|$|Miss Sarah Copp {{was a small}} person, garbed in shabby black, with a hat chosen {{less for}} vain {{adornment}} than for qualities that would wear well. She looked as amazed {{as might be expected}} on seeing the curious tableau in <b>her</b> <b>yard,</b> but when she heard Diana's explanation she was all sympathy. She hurriedly unlocked the back door, produced the axe, and with a few skillfull blows set Anne free. The latter, somewhat tired and stiff, ducked down into the interior of her prison and thankfully emerged into liberty once more.|$|E
60|$|And yet Lady Staveley was not {{attached}} to Mr. Furnival with any peculiar warmth of friendship; {{but she was}} one of those women whose foolish hearts will not allow themselves to be controlled in the exercise of their hospitality. Her nature demanded of her that she should ask a guest to stay. She would not have allowed a dog to depart from her house at this season of the year, without suggesting to him that he had better take his Christmas bone in <b>her</b> <b>yard.</b> It was for Mr. Furnival to adjust all matters between himself and his wife. He was not bound to accept the invitation because she gave it; but she, finding him there, already present in the house, did feel herself bound to give it;--for which offence, as I have said before, I cannot bring myself to forgive her.|$|E
6000|$|Meantime, {{from the}} {{beginning}} all this had been descried from the ship's mast heads; and squaring <b>her</b> <b>yards,</b> she had borne down upon the scene; and was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed her!--"Sail on the"-- but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick, and whelmed him for the time. But struggling out of it again, and chancing to rise on a towering crest, he shouted,--"Sail on the whale!--Drive him off!" ...|$|R

The course prescribed for Blood and Levasseur lay eastward along the northern shores of Hispaniola. To that course the Arabella continued to hold steadily throughout the night. When day broke again, she was alone. La Foudre under cover of the darkness had struck away to The northeast with every rag of canvas on <b>her</b> <b>yards.</b>|$|R

6000|$|In {{the case}} supposed, then, the mother, {{in order to}} manage it right, would first {{consider}} for a moment whether there was any decisive objection to the plan. This would depend, perhaps, upon {{the manner in which}} the children were dressed at the time, or upon the amount of injury that would be done to the yard; and this question would in its turn depend, in many cases, on the comparative value set by the mother upon the beauty of <b>her</b> <b>yard,</b> and the health, development, and happiness of her children. But supposing that she sees--which she can do in most instances at a glance--that there can no serious harm be done by the experiment, but only that it is a foolish plan so far as the attainment of the object is concerned, and utterly hopeless of success, which, considering that the real end to be attained is the healthy development of the children's powers by the agreeable exercise of them in useless as well as in useful labors, is no objection at all, then she should answer at once, [...] "Yes, you can do that if you like; and perhaps I can help you about planning the work." ...|$|E
6000|$|I wish here to {{make some}} mention of Euphemia's methods of work in her chicken-yard. She kept a book, which she at first called her [...] "Fowl Record," [...] but she {{afterward}} changed the name to [...] "Poultry Register." [...] I never could thoroughly understand this book, although she has often explained every part of it to me. She had pages for registering the age, description, time of purchase or of birth, and subsequent performances of every fowl in <b>her</b> <b>yard.</b> She had divisions of the book for expenses, profits, probable losses and positive losses; she noted the number of eggs put under each setting hen; the number of eggs cracked per day, the number spoiled, and finally, the number hatched. Each chick, on emerging from its shell, was registered, and an account kept of its subsequent life and adventures. There were frequent calculations regarding the advantages of various methods of treatment, and there were statements {{of the results of}} a great many experiments--something like this: [...] "Set Toppy and her sister Pinky, April 2nd 187-; Toppy with twelve eggs,--three Brahma, four common, and five Leghorn; Pinky with thirteen eggs (as she weighs four ounces more than her sister), of which three were Leghorn, five common, and five Brahma. During the twenty-second and twenty-third of April (same year) Toppy hatched out four Brahmas, two commons, and three Leghorns, while her sister, on these days and the morning of the day following, hatched two Leghorns, six commons, and only one Brahma. Now, could Toppy, who had only three Brahma eggs, and hatched out four of that breed, have exchanged eggs with her sister, thus making it possible for her to hatch out six common chickens, when she only had five eggs of that kind? Or, did the eggs get mixed up in some way before going into the possession of the hens? Look into probabilities." ...|$|E
