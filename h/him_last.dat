Bailey hit {{his head on}} the ice so hard that a priest in attendance gave <b>him</b> <b>last</b> rites. Bailey lived for almost 60 more years, but his playing career was over. Shore was suspended for 16 games of a 48-game season for the hit.|$|E

This time, Robert walks his {{daughter}} {{down the aisle and}} Robin asks Anna to be her maid of honor (as opposed to Maxie who had the honors the first time). Patrick asks his brother, Dr. Matt Hunter, to be his best man (in place of Coleman who stood up for <b>him</b> <b>last</b> time). On December 26, the wedding goes off without a hitch. No shootings, no delays, no drama. Just love and romance and happiness.|$|E
25|$|In the jousting match Lancelot easily defeats {{all three}} knights. He wounds Sir Lionel, who fights <b>him</b> <b>last,</b> {{so badly that}} the crowd thinks he is dead. But the dismay of the crowd turns to awe as Lancelot's distraught cries for Sir Lionel to live {{seemingly}} resurrect a dead man. Reflecting the adoration of the crowd, Guinevere finds herself {{falling in love with}} Lancelot. She does not wish to violate her marriage vows, however, and wishes Lancelot would leave Camelot ("Before I Gaze at You Again"). By some unfortunate twist of fate, Lancelot, in spite of his boasts that he is immune to pleasures of the flesh, is also madly in love with Guinevere, and is similarly torn by the conflict between this love and his devotion to Arthur. Arthur makes Lancelot a Knight of the Round Table. As it happens, the shrewd King Arthur guesses that Lancelot and Guinevere have feelings for each other, but hopes it will blow over, as he does not wish to upset the tranquility of Camelot. He soliloquizes to his sword Excalibur, that they will rise to the challenges they will all face, together.|$|E

25|$|The No. 88 team {{then had}} two bad weeks, with a 30th-place finish at Watkins Glen {{due to a}} late race crash with Kasey Kahne. The next week, Earnhardt blew a right front tire while running in the Top 10. The damage was enough that he {{finished}} 26 laps down, in 36th place. This evaporated his Chase cushion, but with finishes of 10th at Bristol and 8th at Atlanta, {{he was able to}} rebuild this cushion. At Richmond, the last race of the regular season, Earnhardt only needed to finish 32nd or better to make the Chase. A 13th-place finish did this, and he entered the Chase seeded in ninth place. This {{was the first time in}} Earnhardt's career that he had made three straight Chase appearances. In the first Chase race at Chicagoland Speedway, Earnhardt suffered an engine failure, placing <b>him</b> <b>last</b> in Chase competition. He bounced back at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, leading 17 laps and finishing 6th. The result was good enough to move Earnhardt up to 11th in Chase for the Sprint Cup standings with eight races left in the season.|$|E
25|$|The {{latest version}} of Los Guerreros was Chavo Guerrero Jr. and the widow of Eddie Guerrero, Vickie Guerrero (they are not {{referred}} to, however, as Los Guerreros). Vickie acted as the manager/valet for Chavo, who was upset about Eddie's name being used by non-Guerreros (namely Rey Mysterio, with whom they maintained their first feud with). The duo used the cheating tactics that made the Guerreros famous, though this time {{to the dismay of}} the audience instead of the delight. It wasn't long after the end of their feud with Rey that Chris Benoit (another close friend of Eddie) started questioning their motives, leading to them feuding with Benoit {{over the course of a}} few short months, with Chavo becoming the number one contender for Benoit's WWE United States Championship, though failing at each opportunity mainly because of Vickie's actions constantly getting him disqualified, leading to Vickie leaving Chavo (she soon after declared in late January in backstage interviews with Kristal Marshall that she would be returning to SmackDown soon, though disappeared off of WWE TV directly after). It wasn't until mid-February at No Way Out 2007 that Chavo became WWE Cruiserweight Champion after emerging victorious in a Cruiserweight Open, which saw him as a surprise entry, pinning Jimmy Wang Yang to eliminate <b>him</b> <b>last</b> and win the title from Gregory Helms, ending Helms' more than a year-long reign.|$|E

Phillies outfielder Von Hayes defended Combs after the game, [...] "Gooden better expect retaliation if he keeps hitting guys with [...] fastballs. We've got to protect our players." [...] Gooden charged the mound and tackled Combs. Phillies catcher Darren Daulton followed Gooden and landed a series of punches {{on the back of}} Gooden's head. Darryl Strawberry had been in the Mets clubhouse and rushed the field after Daulton but was himself blindsided by Hayes. Of Daulton, Gooden later said, [...] "Daulton was the guy we wanted most. He's a cheap-shot artist. We learned that about <b>him</b> <b>last</b> year", referring to the September 1989 fight. Six players and Phillies coach Mike Ryan were ejected from the game.

He led the team in scoring, rebounding, minutes played (36.4 minutes per game), field goals made and free throws made and attempted. Anthony's 33-point outburst against the University of Texas in the Final Four set an NCAA tournament record for most points by a freshman. In the championship game against the University of Kansas, Anthony had 20 points and 10 rebounds.

Pitt wished to discuss this with Fitzwilliam in person. On 23 June Fitzwilliam wrote to the Duke of Portland that he believed the government had moved to the Whig position and that [...] "for my own part I am now ready, not only to adopt the opinion that a junction should take place, as your sentiment, but to advise it as the genuine offspring of my own judgement... as much weight and sway should be given to us as possible. ... In my humble opinion, this junction will not produce half its effect if it is not opened to the world by such marks of real substantial favour and confidence {{on the part of the}} Crown towards us as will mark beyond dispute the return of weight, power and consideration to the Old Whigs...after thirty years' exclusion from patronage in the line of peerage" [...] new Whig peers should be created. He also rejected office except of [...] "going to Ireland, but...it is impossible". However the Duke of Portland and Lord Mansfield implored Fitzwilliam to accept office and when Lord Mansfield saw Fitzwilliam when he came down to London on 28 June he got Fitzwilliam [...] "to admit that if ever he was to take office this was the time".

When Pitt met the Duke of Portland on 1 July he offered the Lord Lieutenancy of Ireland to Fitzwilliam as soon as Lord Westmoreland could be compensated for the loss of it. Therefore, on 3 July Fitzwilliam agreed to join the coalition government as Lord President of the Council for the time being, writing that day to Lady Rockingham: [...] "It is a time when private affection must give way to public exigency".|$|E
