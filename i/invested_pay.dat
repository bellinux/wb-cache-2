40|$|A {{large part}} of group {{differences}} in wages comes from unobserved or unverifiable characteristics such as the intensity of human capital investments on-the-job. This is notably the classical argument to account for gender differentials. We build a framework in which training decisions are bilateral, {{in the presence of}} frictions in the labor market generated by a flow-matching model. Workers make learning efforts while firm <b>invest</b> by <b>paying</b> direct training costs. Under complementarity of the learning function of these two inputs (effort and direct costs), the outcome of training decisions requires coordination between the firm and the worker. We exhibit cases in which a high investment in training/high effort Nash equilibrium is a dominant strategy, which makes discrimination between groups difficult, and cases {{in which there is a}} coordination failure. We define coordination discrimination as a case in which observed characteristics of workers (gender, race, diploma) help to coordinate on an equilibrium. We explore the case of unobservable types of workers, and study under which conditions the (common knowledge) priors of firms do not affect the equilibrium strategies, and under which conditions they play a crucial role instead. ...|$|R

For when saved and invested (and all savings, speaking generally, are <b>invested)</b> it thenceforth <b>pays</b> income-tax on the interest or profit which it brings, notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal. Unless, therefore, savings are exempted from income-tax, the contributors are twice taxed on what they save, and only once on what they spend. To tax the sum invested, and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment, is to tax the same portion of the contributor’s means twice over.|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] This paper {{investigates the}} {{character}} of disposal of wealth from Quranic perspective with constructive reference towards the disposal of wealth {{for the cause of}} Allah. We do believe that the discussion of the disposal of wealth is clearly general and involves various variables, yet this paper particularly focuses on the act of infaq since it is the most fundamental keyword within consumption decision. This can be observed once Al Quran presents the idea of the disposal of wealth for the cause of Allah which includes sadaqah, zakat, hibah, nafqah and waqaf. Disposing wealth in general is much broader than to consume, save, <b>invest</b> and <b>pay</b> tax, the way like we understood in conventional economics. It is a matter on how the disposal of wealth could get us closer to our God. Therefore, the connotation of disposing of wealth for the cause of Allah is explicitly being mentioned as frequent as it is a significant attribute of a true believer. In general, Al Quran highlights two main types of the disposal of wealth namely to spend for the family and to spend for the sake of Him. In which the latter takes place on a thoughtful-yet-voluntary approach. It would be necessary to denote since then that this paper will not go into deeper the obliged-way of disposing wealth like zakat and inheritance...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use a}} large linked employer-employee data set on German establishments between 1993 and 2012 to {{investigate}} how the gender composition of {{the top layer of}} management affects a variety of establishment and worker outcomes. We use two different measures to identify the gender composition of the top layer based on direct survey data: the fraction of women among top managers, and the fraction of women among working proprietors. We document the following facts: a) There is a strong negative association between the fraction of women in the top layer of management and several establishment outcomes, among them business volume, investment, total wage bill per worker, total employment, and turnover; b) Establishments with a high fraction of women in the top layer of management are more likely to implement female-friendly policies, such as providing childcare facilities or promoting and mentoring female junior staff; c) The fraction of women in the top layer of management is also negatively associated with employment and wages, both male and female, full-time and part-time. However, all of these associations vanish when we include establishment fixed effects and establishment-specific time trends. This reveals a substantial sorting of female managers across establishments: small and less productive establishments that <b>invest</b> less, <b>pay</b> their employees lower wages, but are more female-friendly {{are more likely to be}} led by women...|$|R
40|$|Renewable {{energies}} {{have potential}} for supplying of relatively clean and mostly local energy. Wind energy generation {{is expected to}} increase in the near future and has experienced dramatic growth over the past decade in many countries. Offshore winds are generally stronger and more constant than onshore winds in many areas. The economic feasibility for utilization of offshore wind energy depends on the favorable wind conditions in the area. The present paper analyses offshore wind speed in global scale and also studies feasibility of introducing this technology for harnessing wind in Persian Gulf, Caspian Sea, Urmia Lake and Gulf of Oman. Wind speed data were collected from different sources. The ocean surface winds at a 10 Â m height from satellite passes as processed by NOAA/NESDIS, from near real-time data collected by NASA/JPL's Sea Winds Scatterometer aboard the QuikSCAT. Development of renewable energy is one of priority research goals in Iran.

40|$|The paper {{shows that}} {{politically}} motivated interventions {{in the financial}} market {{in the form of}} bailing out borrowing firms reduce banks' incentives to gather valuable information about firms' projects. This loss of information is a hidden cost which adversely affects firm value. Firms <b>invest</b> resources and <b>pay</b> a premium to politically connected persons (BOD or other personnel). Such connections serve the twin purposes of hedging and enhancement of the value of collateral pledged against bank loans. Feeling secured, banks lose incentives to monitor borrowing firms. Thus, wealth effect of bailout from political connection is partially offset by the losses of valuable information brought about by bank lending. In equilibrium, the trade-off from gains out of political connections and costs due to losses from information-based bank monitoring depend on (i) the country's disclosure laws, (ii) the political environment, (iii) the premium paid to form connections, and (iv) the state of the economy...|$|R

The thesis is going to identify {{the similarities and differences}} between Sun Tzu's Art of War and current common <b>investing</b> methods; <b>pay</b> special attention to the differences, because here is their value for future potential usages; classify the differences as beneficial, harmful or irrelevant to investing; use those beneficial differences to aid investing strategy and avoid those harmful differences. The researcher used a hybrid of quantitative, qualitative, case study and classical 'positivistic' design with which nine top investors were selected as micro cases and their correlation with eight Sun's useful differences from common investing practices (from literature review) were scored and analysed. From the study of t-test, pattern, trend and causation, the research proves that there are significant {{relationships between}} them and between some of the individual categories (ethics and self defence; human centeredness; reliable sources and materials). So we may use Sun's different strategy to aid our investing process just like what some of the top investors are partially doing and profiting from consciously or subconsciously.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we revisit some major orthodoxies which {{lie at the}} heart of the bitcoin crypto {{currency}} and its numerous clones.

We claim that these built-in properties are not as brilliant as they are sometimes claimed. A closer examination reveals that they are closer to being [...] . engineering mistakes which other crypto currencies have copied rather blindly. More precisely we show that the capacity of current crypto currencies to resist double spending attacks is poor and most current crypto currencies are highly vulnerable. Satoshi did not implement a timestamp for bitcoin transactions and the bitcoin software does not attempt to monitor double spending events. As a result major attacks involving hundreds of millions of dollars can occur and would not even be recorded. Hundreds of millions have been <b>invested</b> to <b>pay</b> for ASIC hashing infrastructure yet insufficient attention was paid to network neutrality and to insure that the protection layer it promises is effective and cannot be abused. In this paper we develop a theory of Programmed Self-Destruction of crypto currencies. We observe that most crypto currencies have mandated abrupt and sudden transitions. These affect their hash rate and therefore their protection against double spending attacks which we do not limit the to the notion of 51 % attacks which is highly misleading. In addition we show that smaller bitcoin competitors are substantially more vulnerable. In addition to small hash rate, many bitcoin competitors mandate incredibly important adjustments in miner reward. We exhibit examples of 'alt-coins' which validate our theory and for which the process of programmed decline and rapid self-destruction has clearly already started.
