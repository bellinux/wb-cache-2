50|$|An <b>interstitial</b> <b>ad</b> {{displays}} {{before a}} user can access requested content, sometimes while the user {{is waiting for}} the content to load. Interstitial ads are a form of interruption marketing.|$|E
50|$|In digital marketing, {{the term}} “interstitial” {{is often used}} {{in the sense of}} “interstitial advertising”, rather than “interstitial webpage”. In some cases, this may lead to {{confusion}} because <b>interstitial</b> <b>ads</b> are not always served on interstitial webpages. According to a standard advanced by the IAB, an interstitial (also known as a between-the-page ad) can either be displayed on a separate webpage, or appear briefly as an overlay on the target page. Moreover, mobile advertising guidelines created by the Mobile Marketing Association (MMA) include in-app <b>interstitial</b> <b>ads,</b> that are integrated into applications, rather than web pages.|$|R
50|$|The AdDuplex cross-promotion {{platform}} allows {{developers to}} gain more exposure by helping each other. For each 10 ads one shows in his app, his ad will be displayed 8 times in other apps on the network. The platform supports different formats, including text, image banners and full-screen (<b>interstitial)</b> <b>ads.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Display {{advertising}} - As {{the term}} infers, Online Display Advertisement is deals with showcasing promotional messages or {{ideas to the}} consumer on the internet. This include {{a wide range of}} advertisements like advertising blogs, networks, <b>interstitial</b> <b>ads,</b> contextual data, ads on the search engines, classified or dynamic advertisement etc. The method can target specific audience tuning in from different types of locals to view a particular advertisement, the variations can be found as the most productive element of this method.|$|R
5000|$|Mobile {{advertising}} is ad copy delivered through wireless mobile {{devices such as}} smartphones, feature phones, or tablet computers. Mobile advertising may {{take the form of}} static or rich media display ads, SMS (Short Message Service) or MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) ads, mobile search ads, advertising within mobile websites, or ads within mobile applications or games (such as <b>interstitial</b> <b>ads,</b> [...] "advergaming," [...] or application sponsorship). Industry groups such as the Mobile Marketing Association have attempted to standardize mobile ad unit specifications, similar to the IAB's efforts for general online advertising.|$|R
5000|$|Standard online {{advertising}} formats (e.g. Banner <b>ads,</b> <b>interstitials.)</b> - A banner ad is a rectangular advertisement appearing {{at the top}} or bottom of a web-page. Banner ads are typically 468 X 60 pixels. An interstitial is an advertisement that interrupts the user. It may be a full page or a pop up window.|$|R
50|$|The 5 basic game modes contain ads, {{displayed}} {{at the end of}} each game, and there are new features added in Windows 8 (Daily Challenges and Star Club) where users will see <b>interstitial</b> video <b>ads</b> roughly every 15 minutes, but only between games. Users can optionally pay $1.49/month or $10/year to get the Premium Edition of the game, which removes all advertisements, gives double coins for completing Daily Challenges, and gives some bonuses in the basic TriPeaks and Pyramid game modes. Users who downloaded the iOS or Android app between November 23 and December 31, 2016 were given a month of Premium on that iOS or Android device.|$|R
50|$|Since the company’s {{switch from}} an SMS-based search engine to an {{advertising}} platform, {{they have made}} several product announcements. The company started with simple text-based ads and has moved to include other ad formats such as video and native ads, including conventional ad formats such as <b>interstitial</b> and banner <b>ads.</b> The company also provides a Software Development Kit (SDK) for mobile app creators who wish to integrate InMobi’s advertising within their app.|$|R
50|$|Chartboost is a San Francisco-based mobile game {{discovery}} and monetization platform. The company, which {{acts as a}} business engine for mobile games, allows video game developers to create customized <b>interstitial</b> and video <b>ads,</b> promote new games, and swap traffic with one another. Developers have direct access to game data derived from Chartboost-enabled games. As of 2016, Chartboost had been integrated into more than 300,000 games with 40 billion game sessions per month. The company has raised $21 million in funding and has offices in San Francisco and Amsterdam.|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of N {{deposition}} on shrub-moss competition and the establishment and growth of invasive Betula pubescens and Molinia caerulea in intact bog vegetation removed from a site subject to 40 kg N ha(- 1) yr(- 1). Mesocosms with and without introduced Betula seedlings and Molinia sprouts were kept under a roof and received an equivalent of 0, 40 and 80 kg N ha(- 1) yr(- 1) for two growing seasons. N concentration in both interstitial water and Sphagnum decreased when N input ceased and increased when N input was doubled. Molinia biomass {{was positively related to}} the inorganic N concentration in the <b>interstitial</b> water. <b>Adding</b> N increased production of Molinia and prolonged survival of Betula seedlings in the first year. Sphagnum height increment showed a hump-shaped relationship with light interception by vascular plants. N deposition encouraged vascular plants to grow by enhancing N availability in the rhizosphere. Water table level and the availability of P were found to be important in explaining species-specific responses to N deposition. The underlying mechanisms and the reversibility of N effects are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Effect of {{interstitial}} {{elements in}} Ti 2 Ni intermetallic comopound has been investigated. <b>Added</b> <b>interstitial</b> elements are oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon. Although Ti 2 Ni contains around 14 at% oxygen without changing its crystal structure, the intermetallic compound is found dissolved a smaller amount of nitrogen, and carbon. The excess interstitial elements form titanium carbide and nitride. As mealy nitrogen content increased, we observed {{a substantial increase}} of viscosity at the fluid metallic compound under argon are melting process. The effects of interstitial elements were estimated by X-ray powder diffraction method with Rietveld analysis, grain structure analysis, electric resistivility measurement, and density measurement. We quantitatively analyzed series of crystal structure between Ti 2 Ni and Ti 4 Ni 2 O. Although slight anomalous change of resistivility was observed, sufficient physical property changes were not obtained to explain the rapid increase of viscosity with nitrogen addition...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To compare MRI-guided {{treatment}} planning approaches {{between four}} centres that use tandem-ovoid applicators. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four centres generated three treatment plans for four patients: standard, optimised intracavitary, and optimised intracavitary/interstitial. Prescribed D 90 High-Risk CTV (HR-CTV) was 85 Gy EQD 2 (external-beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy), while the D(2 cc) OAR limit was 90 Gy EQD 2 for bladder and 75 Gy EQD 2 for rectum, sigmoid, and bowel, respectively. DVH-parameters, source loading patterns and spatial dose distributions {{of the three}} treatment plans were compared. RESULTS: The standard plans of the different centres were comparable {{with respect to the}} D 90 HR-CTV, but differed in OAR doses. MRI-guided intracavitary optimisation resulted in organ sparing and smaller variation in DVH parameters between the centres. <b>Adding</b> <b>interstitial</b> needles led to target dose escalation while respecting the OAR constraints. However, substantial differences in relative weights of the applicator parts resulted in an increased variation in DVH parameters and locations of high dose regions. CONCLUSIONS: MRI-guided brachytherapy treatment planning optimisation provides the possibility to increase the dose to the HR-CTV and spare the OARs. Depending on the degree of conformity the centres make different choices in relative weighting of applicator parts, leading to different dose distributions. status: publishe...|$|R
