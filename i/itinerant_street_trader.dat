30|$|According to Skinner (2008) and Peberdy (2016), a {{major factor}} that swells the number of <b>itinerant</b> <b>street</b> <b>traders</b> in sub-Saharan Africa is {{international}} migration. As Landau (2007) points out, international migration is an inexorable response to regional economic inequalities. Itinerant trading is thus what many foreign immigrants opt to do at their destinations. Lonreco-Lindell (2004) for example cites {{the case of the}} Dyulas-itinerant traders who have been active in West Africa for centuries, moving goods across borders. For many villages, itinerant migrant traders are the primary source of supplies (Skinner, 2008). Peberdy’s (2016) study, one of the few surveys on cross border traders in Southern Africa, suggested that itinerant migrant traders either supply domestic <b>street</b> <b>traders</b> or sell their wares directly.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the process of}} <b>street</b> <b>trader</b> displacements through the views of <b>street</b> <b>traders</b> and other urban actors, and {{through the lens of}} the Right to the City concept, reviewing the ways in which public space is viewed and regulated and the interplay of rights in urban public space within the context of Lagos, Nigeria. The Right to the City concept is also critiqued in this particular African context through the case study of trader displacements in Oshodi Market, Lagos, in 2009. This investigation was conducted through a case-study and mixed-method approach using interviews, documentary analysis and observation. The displacement of <b>street</b> <b>traders</b> from public spaces is a common government policy in developing world cities despite widespread arguments that displacements lead to marginalisation of <b>street</b> <b>traders.</b> The spread of global capitalism has escalated tensions as street trade and neoliberal urban development fundamentally depend on public space, but <b>street</b> <b>traders</b> are often relegated, with urban public space perhaps the clearest physical domain in which exclusion is manifest. The Right to the City has been used to question competing claims to the city and has gained wide acclaim globally, it has however been criticised as lacking adequate contextual grounding. The research reveals wide-ranging negative impacts of displacements on <b>street</b> <b>traders</b> and other urban groups, and significant lapses in urban management in Lagos. It was found that the Right to the City did not feature in the experience of <b>street</b> <b>traders</b> in Oshodi as traders do not possess any rights in public space. In addition key context specific challenges of implementing the Right to the City are identified. The thesis establishes a rights-based framework for urban governance based on the Right to the City which can be implemented in Lagos and similar context...|$|R

40|$|M. Com. (Business Management) Abstract: Street trading plays a {{significant}} role in the informal economy; this economy has grown worldwide given worsening economic conditions in many countries (Willemse, 2011). Over the years, the informal economy has created jobs for many South Africans, and taking into consideration the high rate of joblessness in South Africa, the informal sector continue to improve the lives of many people especially for a lot of people from disadvantaged communities. The primary objective of the research was to identify the factors influencing street trading in the Tshwane Central Business District. The secondary objectives for this research included determining the characteristics of informal <b>street</b> <b>traders</b> operating in the Tshwane CBD; to investigate the survival challenges that informal <b>street</b> <b>traders</b> face in the Tshwane CBD; to investigate if <b>street</b> <b>traders</b> are aware of street trading policies; to identify if <b>street</b> <b>traders</b> are licensed to operate; to determine how the <b>street</b> <b>traders</b> view their relationship with the Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality and Municipal Officials; and finally to make recommendations on actions that the municipality can adopt to effectively manage the informal street trading sector in the Tshwane region. The literature review gives a detailed summary on the topic through the use of secondary data. It provided a conceptualisation of street trading, characteristics of the informal street trading sector and challenges facing street trading. It also tackled the main drivers influencing street trading activities, and finally the benefits accruing from street trading activities. A total of thirty (30) <b>street</b> <b>traders</b> were interviewed. The main themes that emerged from the interviews with regard to the factors influencing street trading in the Tshwane CBD, were unemployment, migration and urbanisation, poverty, entrepreneurial ambitions and for survival. The views and perspectives of the participants of the study during the data collection process in addition to the literature review was used as a base [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose/objective: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate the influence of the 2008 xenophobic events on the structure of earnings of <b>street</b> <b>traders</b> in inner-city Johannesburg and to provide recommendations to policymakers. Problem investigated: The xenophobic events of 2008 are well documented, but absent from the literature is the potential influence on the earnings of foreign <b>street</b> <b>traders.</b> This study investigates this influence through analysis of data from before and after the events. Design and methodology: The study applies an exploratory cross-sectional research design using data from three different samples. Mann-Whitney and Chi-squared measures are applied together with exploratory multiple linear regression analysis to generate insight into the relationships between earnings and differences by origin. Findings and implications: In 2009 the earnings structure of the sector changed. In 2008 and 2010, the earnings of foreign traders are higher, whereas in 2009 these traders earned less than local traders. It is argued that the xenophobic events might have resulted in a temporary restructuring of earnings. Originality or value of the research: This study makes a contribution through exploratory findings that document a change in the structure of earnings of foreign <b>street</b> <b>traders.</b> Conclusion: A change in the structure of earnings of foreign <b>street</b> <b>traders</b> occurred after the xenophobic events of 2008.

40|$|The {{significant}} proportion of the poor in Indian cities who depend on street trade for their livelihoods are increasingly threatened by eviction as a result of urban development programmes implemented since the mid 1990 s. Research on urban <b>street</b> <b>traders</b> (in particular) and the urban informal economy (in general) in the developing world has primarily focussed on aspects of its social and economic organisation and have treated <b>street</b> <b>traders</b> as a homogenous group with a uniform ability to claim places. In contrast, this research explores the differential intracity spatial and political processes underpinning street trade, with particular reference to their ability to occupy and defend their trading places, in the city of Bangalore in Karnataka, India. It focuses on the everyday practices and relationships of <b>street</b> <b>traders</b> and explores the role of informal networks that give rise to such differences, through a qualitative research design and a grounded theoretical strategy. It illustrates the ways in which processes specific to a locale affect street traders' ability to occupy and defend places - an aspect that is overlooked in the theories about the politics of street trade. It argues that the territorial embeddedness of <b>street</b> <b>traders</b> is critical in so far as it affects their ability to draw on a range of networks. This thesis makes a contribution to knowledge in two ways: by providing an empirical understanding of the intra-city differences in how <b>street</b> <b>traders</b> occupy and defend places from where they can trade; and at a theoretical level on the role of urban place and the politics of street trade. It concludes with a discussion of the implications of the research findings for policies relating to urban poverty and governance of urban space...|$|R
