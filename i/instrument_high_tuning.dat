5000|$|... opening chorus: [...] "Herr, unser Herrscher ..." [...] ("Lord, our master, ..." [...] ). There is an orchestral {{intonation}} of 36 bars {{before the}} explosive {{entrance of the}} chorus. Each of these bars is a single stress of lower tones, weakening {{till the end of}} the bar. These bass beats are accompanied by the remaining <b>instruments</b> of <b>higher</b> <b>tunes,</b> by legato singing the prospective theme. The last six bars of the orchestral intro produce a robust crescendo, arriving to shouting forte initial three bars of the chorus, where the chorus joins to the long sequence of deep stresses by Herr, Herr, Herr. Soon, after the first portion of the theme, comes the triple Herr, Herr, Herr again, but this time, {{at the end of the}} bars, as a contra answer for the corresponding orchestral deep stresses at the beginning of the bars. Finally, the entire A section is repeated."Herr, unser Herrscher" [...] and [...] "O Mensch, bewein dein Sünde groß" [...] are very different in character. The latter is full of torment in its text, but a serenely majestic piece of music. [...] "Herr, unser Herrscher" [...] sounds as if it has chains of dissonance between the two oboes and the turmoil of the [...] sixteenth notes in the strings. Especially, when they invade the bass, it is full of anguish and therefore it characterizes the St John Passion.|$|R
5000|$|Almost every {{instrument}} in a kebyar ensemble is {{paired with a}} male and female counterpart. Each {{instrument in}} a pair is tuned differently from its counterpart, one higher and one lower. Played at the same time, the <b>higher</b> <b>instrument</b> (known as pengisep or [...] "inhaler") and the lower instrument (known as the pengumbang or [...] "exhaler"), produce a beating effect (ombak) by sympathetic resonance, creating an overall shimmering, pulsating quality. The female instrument is tuned lower, while the male <b>instrument</b> is <b>tuned</b> <b>higher.</b> For example, one note on a female gangsa pemadé might be tuned to 220 Hz, while the male gangsa pemadé might be <b>tuned</b> slightly <b>higher</b> to 228 Hz. Some kebyar ensembles are tuned so that the numban ensemble is tuned so that the beats are significantly faster for higher frequencies, with the lowest jegog notes nearly a quarter-tone apart. A gendered pair of gangsa will play interlocking kotekan melodies, such that in each pair one interlocking part (polos or sangsih) is on the female {{and the other on}} the male instrument. The second pair of that instrument (e.g., pemade) uses the opposite arrangement, so that there is one instrument of each gender playing each part: female polos, male sangsih, female sangsih, and male polos, for full balance.|$|R

40|$|Fuzzy PID tuning {{requires}} {{two stages}} of tuning; low level <b>tuning</b> followed by <b>high</b> level <b>tuning.</b> At the <b>higher</b> level, a nonlinear tuning is performed to determine the nonlinear characteristics of the fuzzy output. At the lower level, a linear tuning is performed to determine the linear characteristics of the fuzzy output for achieving overall performance of fuzzy control. First, different fuzzy systems are defined and then simplified for two-point control. Non-linearity tuning diagrams are constructed for fuzzy systems in order to perform <b>high</b> level <b>tuning.</b> The linear tuning parameters are deduced from the conventional PID tuning knowledge. Using the <b>tuning</b> diagrams, <b>high</b> level <b>tuning</b> heuristics are developed.
