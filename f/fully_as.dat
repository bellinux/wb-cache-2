For his life and work he was given monastic and royal honorific names, that is Phrakhru Samanadham-samathan (in 1921), Phrabhavanakosolthera , Phramongkolratmuni , and finally Phramongkolthepmuni (in 1957). The last three royal titles were given late, {{due to the fact that}} the temple was not under royal patronage, and therefore received less attention from the royal family than other temples.|$|E
5|$|Unusually for an aristocrat of the period, Bute owned {{almost all}} of his lands <b>fully,</b> <b>as</b> an owner in fee simple, rather than having his rights diluted through {{arrangements}} with trustees. When he married in 1818, Bute placed his English and Wales estates into a trustee arrangement for any future children, but this agreement expired with Lady Maria's death in 1842; when he remarried in 1845 a similar trustee agreement was set up, although in this version the Glamorgan estates were administered separately from his other holdings in England and Wales. Bute continued to run his network of estates and estate managers personally, helped by Onesipherus Bruce, a barrister-agent and close friend.|$|E
5|$|Jean Baptiste Lamarck used fossils in his {{arguments}} for {{his theory of}} the transmutation of species in the early 19th century. Fossil finds, and the emerging evidence that life had changed over time, fueled speculation on this topic {{during the next few}} decades. Robert Chambers used fossil evidence in his 1844 popular science book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, which advocated an evolutionary origin for the cosmos as well as for life on earth. Like Lamarck's theory it maintained that life had progressed from the simple to the complex. These early evolutionary ideas were widely discussed in scientific circles but were not accepted into the scientific mainstream. Many of the critics of transmutational ideas used fossil evidence in their arguments. In the same paper that coined the term dinosaur Richard Owen pointed out that dinosaurs were at least as sophisticated and complex as modern reptiles, which he claimed contradicted transmutational theories. Hugh Miller would make a similar argument, pointing out that the fossil fish found in the Old Red Sandstone formation were <b>fully</b> <b>as</b> complex as any later fish, and not the primitive forms alleged by Vestiges. While these early evolutionary theories failed to become accepted as mainstream science, the debates over them would help pave the way for the acceptance of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection a few years later.|$|E

5|$|While {{the church}} in Norway {{initially}} had refused to recognise Haakon as King of Norway, it had largely turned to support his claim to the throne by the 1223 meeting, although later disagreements occurred. Despite additionally having become the undisputed ruler of Norway after 1240, Haakon had still not been approved as king by the Pope due to his illegitimate birth. He nonetheless had a strong personal desire to be approved <b>fully</b> <b>as</b> a European king. Several papal commissions were appointed to investigate the matter, and Haakon declared his legitimate son Haakon the Young his successor instead of an older living illegitimate son. Although Haakon had children with his mistress Kanga the Young prior to his marriage with Margrete, it was his children with Margrete that was designated as his successors in accordance with a papal recognition. The Catholic principle of legitimacy was thus established in the Norwegian order of succession, although Haakon's new law still maintained that illegitimate children could be designated as successor {{in the absence of}} any legitimate children or grandchildren—contrary to Catholic principles. While his strong position allowed him to set boundaries to the church's political influence, he was on the other hand prepared to give the church much autonomy in internal affairs and relations with the rural society.|$|E

After this, {{one of the rare}} failures of his career, Bernini retreated into himself: according to his son, Domenico. his subsequent unfinished statue of 1647, Truth Unveiled by Time, was intended to be his self-consoling commentary on this affair, expressing his faith that eventually Time would reveal the actual Truth behind the story and exonerate him <b>fully,</b> <b>as</b> indeed did occur.|$|E

25|$|In 1996, 11 {{selected}} Sri Lankan {{women were}} ordained <b>fully</b> <b>as</b> Theravada bhikkhunis {{by a team}} of Theravāda monks in concert with a team of Korean nuns in India. There is disagreement among Theravāda vinaya authorities as to whether such ordinations are valid. The Dambulla chapter of the Siam Nikaya in Sri Lanka also carried out a nun's ordination at this time, specifically stating their ordination process was a valid Theravadin process where the other ordination session was not. This chapter has carried out ordination ceremonies for hundreds of nuns since then. This has been criticized by leading figures in the Siam Nikaya and Amarapura Nikaya, and the governing council of Buddhism in Myanmar has declared {{that there can be no}} valid ordination of nuns in modern times, though some Burmese monks disagree with this.|$|E
25|$|Janet and Van Korrell {{purchased}} {{the house when}} the Cannons left in 1992.

Determined to restore it as <b>fully</b> <b>as</b> possible, in 1999 they hired John G. Thorpe to oversee the work. Thorpe, a Wright expert, restoration architect, and {{one of the founders of}} the Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust in Oak Park, Illinois, worked with the original plans and old photos on a complete restoration inside and out, including the Wright-designed cupboards, the ground-level entry, and the daring cantilevered veranda roof. As part of this work, the Korrells elected to build an addition in the previously open northwest corner, balancing the original northeast corner bedroom but moving away from Wright's cruciform design. This addition incorporates a modern laundry and a second stairway to the basement.|$|E
25|$|Dan Patch {{was from}} the first crop of Joe Patchen, {{one of the fastest}} pacers of his time. Joe Patchen's main rival was Star Pointer, the first Standardbred to break the two minute barrier. Joe Patchen was a {{great-grandson}} of Standardbred foundation sire Hambletonian (known more <b>fully</b> <b>as</b> Hambletonian 10 or Rysdyk`s Hambletonian to distinguish him from the Thoroughbred of the same name). Hambletonian sired 40 trotters who met the standard, with several going on to be influential sires. His son George Wilkes raced for twelve years, winning 29 of 67 races. Known for his ill temper, he was initially greeted with indifference at stud but soon became one of the greatest sires of his age. One of George Wilkes's less distinguished sons was Patchen Wilkes, who barely met the standard with a best time of 2:29. Patchen Wilkes's only important offspring was a colt produced by the Morgan mare Josephine and named Joe Patchen after his parents. Though his breeding was suspect, Joe Patchen was a great pacer with a career best of 2:01. Other than Dan Patch, he was not a great success at stud.|$|E

Although the heroes and the Hunters defeat their enemies and save Hera, the king of the Giants, Porphyrion, rises <b>fully</b> <b>as</b> Hera's energy was being used to raise him; and disappears into a hole in the earth to escape Hera as she uses her power to destroy the monsters around her. Back at Camp Half-Blood, Jason's memory then starts returning, and he remembers that he is a hero from Camp Jupiter, a camp for Roman demigods, and is the son of Jupiter, Zeus's Roman counterpart. Meanwhile, Piper challenges Drew and after a brief power-struggle is made the new Aphrodite counselor. Leo shows the Hephaestus campers (along with Jason and Piper) Bunker Nine, revealing his fire powers along the way. In bunker nine, he shows them plans for a ship that would sail to Greece, and the Hephaestus campers decide to undergo the project, also appointing Leo to be their new counselor. Jason realizes that Hera, also known as Juno to the Romans, has switched him with Percy Jackson, who will be at Camp Jupiter with amnesia, in the hopes that the two camps would band together to defeat Gaea and the Giants.|$|E
