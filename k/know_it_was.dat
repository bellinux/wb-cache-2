25|$|In formulating his {{physical}} theories, Newton developed and used mathematical methods now {{included in the}} field of calculus. But the language of calculus as we <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> largely absent from the Principia; Newton gave many of his proofs in a geometric form of infinitesimal calculus, based on limits of ratios of vanishing small geometric quantities. In a revised conclusion to the Principia (see General Scholium), Newton used his expression that became famous, Hypotheses non fingo ("I formulate no hypotheses").|$|E

500|$|One of Jenny's storylines {{in season}} two was her revelation of being sexually abused as a child. The events were portrayed {{in a series}} of flashbacks and dream sequences.

During an interview with LGBT monthly magazine The Advocate, Chaiken commented about the storyline: [...] "Well we all <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an incident of sexual abuse. I had not wanted to be more explicit about it than that – one because memory of trauma is very strange. Who knows what happened to Jenny? Jenny doesn't necessarily know herself." ...|$|E
500|$|This was Cuse's first writing {{credit for}} Lost, having joined the series during the seventh episode. He desired to cement Boone's {{relationship}} with Locke, but was unsure how {{to connect the}} two characters in a meaningful way. The writers chose a vision quest but decided to make this [...] "closed to the audience" [...] and not let them <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> even occurring. Initially, it was conceived that Boone would be convinced into eating Locke's drug, but director Rod Holcomb and the writers thought {{it would have made}} the hallucination easier to guess, and changed it into spreading the concoction into a head injury.|$|E

This was the second episode of the series to not feature Scully, the first being the second season episode [...] "3". Guest actor Morris Panych, portraying the Syndicate assassin The Grey-Haired Man, makes his last appearance in the series in this episode.

[...] She said, [...] "I always thought it was my fault; that I didn’t do or say the right thing. I know young girls who’ve been raped and didn’t even <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> rape.

500|$|Waugh's first biographer, Christopher Sykes, {{records that}} after the divorce friends [...] "saw, or {{believed}} they saw, a new hardness and bitterness" [...] in Waugh's outlook. Nevertheless, despite a letter to Acton in which he wrote that he [...] "did not <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> possible to be so miserable and live", he soon resumed his professional and social life. He finished his second novel, Vile Bodies, and wrote articles including (ironically, he thought) one for the Daily Mail {{on the meaning of}} the marriage ceremony. During this period Waugh began the practice of staying at the various houses of his friends; he was to have no settled home for the next eight years.|$|E
500|$|Bowie himself remembered {{almost nothing}} of the album's production, not even the studio, later admitting, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in LA because I've read it was". The singer {{was not alone in}} his use of cocaine during the sessions, Carlos Alomar commenting, [...] "if there's a line of coke which is going to keep you awake till 8 a.m. so that you can do your guitar part, you do the line of coke... the coke use is driven by the inspiration." [...] Like Bowie, Earl Slick had {{somewhat}} vague memories of the recording: [...] "That album's a little fuzzy—for the obvious reasons!

500|$|The {{production}} team learned—some nine {{weeks prior to}} the start of filming—of a diary containing Logue's original notes on his treatment of the Duke. They then went back and re-worked the script to reflect what was in the notes. Hooper said some of the film's most memorable lines, such as at the climax, when Logue smiles, [...] "You still stammered on the W" [...] to the King, who replies, [...] "I had to throw in a few so they would <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> me" [...] were direct quotations from Logue's notes. Changes from the script to reflect the historical record included Michael Gambon improvising the ramblings of George V as he signed away authority, and the decision in the opening scene to dress the Duke in an overcoat rather than regal finery.|$|E
500|$|In Erdely's story, {{the rape}} was {{supposed}} to have occurred during a party at Phi Kappa Psi as part of a pledging ritual. Phi Kappa Psi countered by noting that there had been no party held {{on the night of the}} alleged attack and no pledges resided in the house at that time of year. In response to those revelations, Jackie's father declared that Phi Kappa Psi had been misidentified and the attack had occurred at a different fraternity, though he did not elaborate as to which one. However, that statement seemed to contradict an earlier assertion the accuser had made to The Washington Post, in which she stated: [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Phi [...] Psi, because a year afterward, my friend pointed out the building to me." ...|$|E

George and Logue are then left in the broadcasting room. He delivers his speech with Logue conducting him, {{but by the end}} he is speaking freely.

500|$|Al Kooper {{recalled}} {{that both the}} album title, Blonde on Blonde, and song titles arrived during the mixing sessions. [...] "When they were mixing it, we were sitting around and Bob Johnston came in and said, 'What {{do you want to}} call this?' And [...] just like said them out one at a time... Free association and silliness, I'm sure, played a big role." [...] Another Dylan chronicler, Oliver Trager, notes that besides spelling out the initials of Dylan's first name, the album title is also a riff on Brecht on Brecht, a stage production based on works by German playwright Bertolt Brecht that had influenced his early songwriting. Dylan himself has said of the title: [...] "Well, I don't even recall exactly how it came up, but I <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> all in good faith... I don't know who thought of that. I certainly didn't." ...|$|E
500|$|Increasing {{wind shear}} caused Paula to weaken to a Category1 {{hurricane}} late on October13. Satellite imagery and reconnaissance aircraft flights indicated that cloud pattern was disrupted and the mid- and low-level centers were becoming detached. [...] Shortly thereafter, the National Hurricane Center remarked {{about the size}} of Paula, stating that, [...] "a hurricane is crossing between the western tip of Cuba and eastern Yucatan...but without modern technology no one would <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> there". Drifting north-northeastward ahead of a mid-latitude trough, Paula weakened to a tropical storm at 1200UTC on October14. Three hours later, the storm made landfall between Santa Lucía and Puerto Esperanza, in the Pinar del Río Province of Cuba, with winds of 65mph (100km/h). By 0600UTC on October15, Paula weakened to a tropical depression, while moving eastward over Cuba. Six hours later, the storm degenerated into a remnant low pressure area, before completely dissipating early on October16.|$|E
500|$|Orbison did not {{authorize the}} use of the song or <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going to be used, but {{the use of}} [...] "In Dreams" [...] proved {{beneficial}} to his career, which had stalled in the 1970s. BAM magazine called the song [...] "the emotional epicenter of the film". Orbison biographer Ellis Amburn called [...] "In Dreams" [...] deceptively simple and that it is used to significant effect in Blue Velvet because it suggests dreaming is preferable to waking, and power and control are the real themes of the song, instead of love, longing, and loss. The film made the song a cult favorite, and after seeing it a few times, Orbison reconsidered his stance on its use. Footage of the film is featured in the 1987 music video of [...] "In Dreams", and interspersed with live action shots of Orbison's image projected over a filmy linen cloth blowing in the wind.|$|E
