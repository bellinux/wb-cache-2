Surfactants are a minor application but generate over $1 {{billion in annual}} revenue. Due to the danger from direct hydrocarbon–fluorine reactions above −150°C (−240°F), industrial fluorocarbon production is indirect, mostly through halogen exchange reactions such as Swarts fluorination, in which chlorocarbon chlorines are substituted for fluorines by <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fluoride</b> under catalysts. Electrochemical fluorination subjects hydrocarbons to electrolysis in <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fluoride,</b> and the Fowler process treats them with solid fluorine carriers like cobalt trifluoride.|$|E

The overall process is one of hydrometallurgy and begins with a leaching step; in which the ore is treated with hydrofluoric acid and sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fluorides,</b> such as the heptafluorotantalate.

50|$|NpF6 or {{neptunium}} hexafluoride {{is extremely}} volatile, as are its adjacent actinide compounds uranium hexafluoride (UF6) and plutonium hexafluoride (PuF6). This volatility {{has attracted a}} large amount of interest to the compound in an attempt to devise a simple method for extracting neptunium from spent nuclear power station fuel rods. NpF6 was first prepared in 1943 by reacting NpF3 and gaseous fluorine at very high temperatures and the first bulk quantities were obtained in 1958 by heating NpF4 and dripping pure fluorine on it in a specially prepared apparatus. Additional methods that have successfully produced neptunium hexafluoride include reacting BrF3 and BrF5 with NpF4 and by reacting several different neptunium oxide and fluoride compounds with anhydrous <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ﬂuorides.</b>|$|R
5|$|At room temperature, {{hydrogen}} bromide is a colourless gas, {{like all the}} hydrogen halides apart from <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fluoride,</b> since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the large and only mildly electronegative bromine atom; however, weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline {{hydrogen bromide}} at low temperatures, similar to the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fluoride</b> structure, before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised. Aqueous hydrogen bromide is known as hydrobromic acid, which is a strong acid (pKa = −9) because the hydrogen bonds to bromine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HBr/H2O system also involves many hydrates HBr·nH2O for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, which are essentially salts of bromine anions and hydronium cations. Hydrobromic acid forms an azeotrope with boiling point 124.3°C at 47.63g HBr per 100g solution; thus hydrobromic acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation.|$|E

Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid (pKa = −7) because the hydrogen bonds to chlorine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HCl/H2O system has many hydrates HCl·nH2O for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Beyond a 1:1 mixture of HCl and H2O, the system separates completely into two separate liquid phases. Hydrochloric acid forms an azeotrope with boiling point 108.58°C at 20.22g HCl per 100g solution; thus hydrochloric acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation.|$|E

40|$|The {{impedance}} of the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fluorides</b> KHF 2, NH 4 HF 2 and BaHF 3 {{was investigated}} {{as a function}} of temperature and in the presence of HF and H 2 O. A comparison of results on different electrode materials. (graphite, silver, palladium, Sn SnF 2, and Sn SnF 2 LaF 3) was used to elucidate the contribution of fluoride ions and protons to the net charge transport. All three investigated materials exhibited a considerable and nearly reversible increase of conductivity in the presence of gases that act as proton donors. In the case of BaHF 3, the results indicate both the mobility of fluoride ions (E-A = 0. 54 eV) as well as a net mobility of protons. The latter is explained by proton exchange due to internal acid-base reactions of the protonated anions. At ambient temperature, KHF 23 only becomes conducting when exposed to HF or H 2 O. NH 4 HF 2, on the other hand, shows a higher conductivity than BaHF 3 already in dry atmosphere increasing less with humidity than the other two materials. This indicates an intrinsic proton mobility in NH 4 HF 2. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
5|$|The tetrafluoride, PrF4, is also known, and is {{produced}} by reacting a mixture of sodium fluoride and praseodymium(III) fluoride with fluorine gas, producing Na2PrF6, following which sodium fluoride {{is removed from the}} reaction mixture with liquid <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fluoride.</b> Additionally, praseodymium forms a bronze diiodide; like the diiodides of lanthanum, cerium, and gadolinium, it is a praseodymium(III) electride compound.|$|E
5|$|Actinium trifluoride can be {{produced}} either in solution or in solid reaction. The former reaction is carried out at room temperature, by adding hydrofluoric acid to a solution containing actinium ions. In the latter method, actinium metal is treated with <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fluoride</b> vapors at 700°C in an all-platinum setup. Treating actinium trifluoride with ammonium hydroxide at 900–1000°C yields oxyfluoride AcOF. Whereas lanthanum oxyfluoride can be easily obtained by burning lanthanum trifluoride in air at 800°C for an hour, similar treatment of actinium trifluoride yields no AcOF and only results in melting of the initial product.|$|E
5|$|At room temperature, it is a {{colourless}} gas, {{like all}} of the hydrogen halides except <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fluoride,</b> since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the large and only mildly electronegative iodine atom.

It is an endothermic compound that can exothermically dissociate at room temperature, although the process is very slow unless a catalyst is present: the reaction between hydrogen and iodine at room temperature to give hydrogen iodide does not proceed to completion. The H–I bond dissociation energy is likewise {{the smallest of the}} hydrogen halides, at 295kJ/mol.|$|E
50|$|From room {{temperature}} to 150 °C no important interface reactions occur {{and the surface}} energy is stable. Between 150 °C and 300 °C more Si-F-H-Si bonds are formed.

The conclusion of the research was a decrease of tooth density after the application of bleaching agent with 45 % carbamide peroxide PF and 38 % hydrogen peroxide PF with statistically significant.

500|$|Moissan's {{method is}} used to produce {{industrial}} quantities of fluorine, via the electrolysis of a potassium fluoride/hydrogen <b>fluoride</b> mixture: <b>hydrogen</b> and <b>fluoride</b> ions are reduced and oxidized at a steel container cathode and a carbon block anode, under 8–12volts, to generate hydrogen and fluorine gas respectively.

Regulator valves and pipework are made of nickel, the latter possibly using Monel instead. Frequent passivation, along with the strict exclusion of water and greases, must be undertaken. In the laboratory, glassware may carry fluorine gas under low pressure and anhydrous conditions; some sources instead recommend nickel-Monel-PTFE systems.|$|R
5|$|Noble gases, having {{complete}} electron shells, defied reaction {{with other}} elements until 1962 when Neil Bartlett reported synthesis of xenon hexafluoroplatinate; xenon difluoride, tetrafluoride, hexafluoride, and multiple oxyfluorides have been isolated since then. Among other noble gases, krypton forms a difluoride, and radon and fluorine generate a solid suspected to be radon difluoride. Binary fluorides of lighter noble gases are exceptionally unstable: argon and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fluoride</b> combine under extreme conditions to give argon fluorohydride. Helium and neon have no long-lived fluorides, and no neon fluoride {{has ever been}} observed; helium fluorohydride has been detected for milliseconds at high pressures and low temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Exposure may not {{be evident}} for eight hours for 50% HF, rising to 24 hours for lower concentrations, and a burn may {{initially}} be painless as <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fluoride</b> affects nerve function. If skin has been exposed to HF, damage can be reduced by rinsing it under a jet of water for 10–15 minutes and removing contaminated clothing. Calcium gluconate is often applied next, providing calcium ions to bind with fluoride; skin burns can be treated with 2.5% calcium gluconate gel or special rinsing solutions. Hydrofluoric acid absorption requires further medical treatment; calcium gluconate may be injected or administered intravenously. Using calcium chloride – a common laboratory reagent – in lieu of calcium gluconate is contraindicated, and may lead to severe complications. Excision or amputation of affected parts may be required.|$|E

Two main experimental techniques were followed throughout this work, (a) reactions in absence of hydrogen or under continuous high vacuum, and (b) reactions with binary metal hydrides, AH{sub x}, in closed containers. The results demonstrate that all the phases reported with the {beta}-Yb{sub 5 }Sb{sub 3 }-type structure in the A{sub 5 }Pn{sub 3 } systems are hydrogen-stabilized compounds. Reactions in absence of hydrogen lead to compounds with the Mn{sub 5 }Si{sub 3 }-type structure.

In {{this study}} the precipitation and dissolution reactions occurring in suspensions of enamel, hydroxyapatite (HAP) and fluorapatite (FAP) on addition of fluoride were investigated under well-defined conditions. pH and pF were monitored; calcium and phosphate concentrations were measured at selected times; the solid phases were examined by infra-red, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Precipitation of phosphate-containing calcium fluoride crystals, CaF 2 (P), can cause severe {{reduction in the}} calcium ion concentration and release of hydrogen ions from the precipitated phosphate. These reactions result in considerable dissolution of enamel, HAP and even of FAP.

Using a specific ion electrode for fluoride, the efficacy of calcium, magnesium and lanthanum salts and hyamine in lowering fluoride ion concentration in the presence of serum was examined.
