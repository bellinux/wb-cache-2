The Greek Orthodox clergy were removed from their sees and replaced with Latin clerics. Up until that point the official Christian presence in the region was Greek Orthodox. On Christmas Day 1100, Baldwin <b>I,</b> <b>first</b> king of the Frankish Kingdom of Jerusalem, was crowned in Bethlehem, and that year a Latin episcopate was also established in the town.|$|E
5|$|One day I chanced {{to see a}} {{performance}} of the Bunraku puppet theater and was very surprised by it.

I was very moved by it and I wondered why my attention had never been captured before by this Japanese music.|$|E

Emperor Pedro II was the last of the direct male line in Brazil descended from Dom Afonso <b>I,</b> <b>first</b> king of Portugal and founder, in 1139, of the dynasty which headed the Brazilian Empire. There were two other male Braganzas, albeit living abroad: Pedro II's half-brother Rodrigo Delfim Pereira and his cousin Miguel, Duke of Braganza. Both were barred from the line of succession, however. The former because he was an illegitimate son, and the latter because he was a foreigner and not a descendant of the first Brazilian Emperor, Pedro I.|$|E

The thing was to decide where to leave it and where to fill it and where to say this doesn't need another line or another pail of colors. It's saying it in space.|$|E
