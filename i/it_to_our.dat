25|$|The {{opposing}} argument {{posits that}} terraforming {{would be an}} unethical interference in nature, and that given humanity's past treatment of Earth, other planets may {{be better off without}} human interference. Still others strike a middle ground, such as Christopher McKay, who argues that terraforming is ethically sound only once we have completely assured that an alien planet does not harbor life of its own; but that if it does, we should not try to reshape <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> own use, but we should engineer its environment to artificially nurture the alien life and help it thrive and co-evolve, or even co-exist with humans. Even this would be seen as a type of terraforming to the strictest of ecocentrists, who would say that all life has the right, in its home biosphere, to evolve without outside interference.|$|E

500|$|Pinkner, Abrams, Orci, Burk, Kurtzman, Wyman, and Goldsman {{developed}} the second season's storyline together. Goldsman {{explained that they}} [...] "mapped" [...] out the season [...] "in {{a way that we}} remained fundamentally faithful to". Though they changed certain aspects, they knew where Olivia and Peter were going to start and end up but [...] "got there at different paces than what [...] originally planned". While the first season both focused on Olivia and dealt with discovering the existence of an enemy, the second was designed to [...] " [...] to a very specific type of confrontation" [...] between the two universes. Explained Pinkner, [...] "Season 2 is about the people from 'over there' putting the final pieces of the invasion into play, and explaining why". At the same time, the producers approached the second season as a [...] "journey of self-actualization" [...] and [...] "maturation for our characters." [...] They wanted to make the three main cast members become more comfortable as a team in Fringe Division; Peter thus was written to be more heroic and to go from reluctance to a desire to help his father, while Walter became gradually more independent and [...] "grounded as a human being". They made the secret of Peter's origins one of the main story focuses of the season. While the audience had been made aware of Walter's secret in the season one finale, the producers wanted to [...] "acknowledge <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> characters". All the while Walter was [...] "suffering... and desperately trying to keep it all quiet", Olivia and Peter grew closer to the truth. By [...] "giv these things time" [...] to develop, Pinkner strove to avoid focusing just on [...] "event, event, event", instead concentrating on the real consequences of Peter and Olivia's eventual discovery.|$|E

Although the artist as a shaman has been a trend in modern art (Picasso, Gauguin), Beuys is unusual in that respect as he integrated “his art and his life into the shaman role.” Beuys believed that humanity, with its turn on rationality, was trying to eliminate “emotions” and thus eliminate {{a major source of}} energy and creativity in every individual. In his first lecture tour in America he was telling the audience that humanity was in an evolving state and that as “spiritual” beings we ought to draw on both our emotions and our thinking as they represent the total energy and creativity for every individual. Beuys described how we must seek out and energize our spirituality and link <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> thinking powers so that “our vision of the world must be extended to encompass all the invisible energies with which we have lost contact.” ...|$|E

In Wuthering Heights the reader is shocked, disgusted, almost sickened by details of cruelty, inhumanity, and the most diabolical hate and vengeance, and anon come passages of powerful testimony to the supreme power of love– even over demons in the human form. The women in the book are of a strange fiendish-angelic nature, tantalising, and terrible, and the men are indescribable out of the book itself. Yet, towards the close of the story occurs the following pretty, soft picture, which comes like the rainbow after a storm... We strongly recommend all our readers who love novelty to get this story, for we can promise them that they never have read anything like it before. It is very puzzling and very interesting, and if we had space we would willingly devote a little more time to the analysis of this remarkable story, but we must leave <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> readers to decide what sort of book it is." ...|$|E
