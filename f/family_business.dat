40|$|<b>Family</b> <b>{{businesses}}</b> {{make up a}} {{large number}} of businesses in South Africa, although they are not often researched. Many of these <b>family</b> <b>businesses</b> are SME (Small and Medium Enterprises), however they contribute substantially to the local economy, as well as job creation. Despite their extensive presence there is a very poor success rate of <b>family</b> <b>businesses.</b> One of the reasons for their low success rate could be the seemingly increased conservative nature of <b>family</b> <b>businesses</b> over time. Thus, a look into entrepreneurial processes, which promote adaptation, innovation and learning, may give <b>family</b> <b>businesses</b> a competitive advantage. An Abbreviated Grounded Theory approach was used to explore the presence, if any, of entrepreneurial processes within established <b>family</b> <b>businesses</b> in Grahamstown. Two generations of family owners as well as a non-family employee across four local businesses were interviewed. The results show that all four business show signs of entrepreneurship within their business, these include: risk taking, creativity, active competition, opportunity grasping and change. Previous generations within the business also showed signs of learning new technology, in turn the new generations learnt from the experience that their parents have had in the businesses. The results show that <b>family</b> <b>businesses</b> are capable of change, adaptation and learning, thus it may enable consultants and future researchers to strengthen <b>family</b> <b>businesses</b> across generations. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Family</b> {{controlled}} <b>businesses</b> are a {{very important}} organizational type as families control many large businesses around the world. In India, <b>family</b> controlled <b>businesses</b> account for 70 percent of total sales and net profits of the biggest 250 private sector companies. <b>Family</b> <b>businesses</b> play {{a very important role}} in the Indian economy. The literature on financial intermediation system has divided the system in two types: 1) Bank Based and 2) Market Based. The literature in Indian financial intermediation system has stated that India's stock markets have a long history and have a large number of listed firms, but the size and role in terms of allocating resources of the markets are dominated by those of the banking sector. The literature also states that informal lending market is a very important source of finance in India. The dissertation has taken the finding of the literature as base and has attempted to develop an understanding about the view point of <b>family</b> <b>businesses</b> on the bank finance market and informal financing market in India, The dissertation also tries to develop an understanding about the belief of the <b>family</b> <b>businesses</b> in India about various options available for raising finance. The dissertation has used the qualitative method of research to achieve its objectives. Case Studies are used as the research strategy. Questionnaires are used as the main means for collecting the data. Further telephonic conversation was made with two respondents to gain a better insight about some specific issues. In contradiction to earlier study this study has found that the bank financing market in India is very competitive and generally established <b>family</b> <b>businesses</b> do not face anyproblem in raising bank finance. The banks are very co-operative with the <b>family</b> <b>businesses</b> and are eager to finance projects of <b>family</b> <b>businesses</b> who have good market credibility. Informal lending markets are found to be important source of finance and established <b>family</b> <b>businesses</b> use it as a source of short term financing. <b>Family</b> <b>businesses</b> in India appear to have a positive approach towards bank financing and listing of companies as funding options. The reason for a positive approach towards bank financing and listing of firms is that the <b>family</b> <b>businesses</b> seems to believe that there is no threat of reduction of influence and control in these options of funding. Another important reason for a positive approach towards bank financing seems to be easy availability of bank financing for <b>family</b> <b>businesses.</b> <b>Family</b> <b>businesses</b> in India seems to have a negative approach towards private placement or external investors in the firm. The positive economic outlook in India has increased the level of activity in India. The majority <b>family</b> <b>businesses</b> in India are bullish about their businesses.

Adopting the resource-based view of the firm, the paper focuses on the determinants of the internationalisation pathways taken by <b>family</b> <b>businesses.</b> Basing on a sample of 146 small and medium sized Norwegian <b>family</b> <b>businesses,</b> we find that the board is an important strategic resource contributing to their international expansion. The results highlight the existence of various relationships between board member characteristics, board tasks performance and the export intensity. In particular, we find that <b>family</b> <b>businesses</b> with higher levels of non-family board members are more likely to be international. Moreover, we find that boards’ involvement in advisory tasks contributes positively to the export intensity. The implications for theory and practice and future research directions are discussed...|$|R
