5|$|Born to {{a working-class}} Italian American family in Dudley, Massachusetts, {{he was raised}} Roman Catholic {{although}} became interested in esotericism as a teenager. He later claimed {{that when he was}} 21, relatives initiated him into a tradition of witchcraft inherited from their Sicilian ancestors; this conflicts with other statements that he made, and there is no independent evidence to corroborate his claim. During the 1950s, he was based in New York City, where he worked as a graphologist and hypnotist. After beginning to publish books on paranormal topics in the early 1960s, he publicly began identifying as Wiccan in 1969, and stated that he was involved <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> coven.|$|E

His chess activities had not yielded any great financial rewards, and he died a pauper in the Manhattan State Hospital (Ward Island) of a heart attack on August 12, 1900. Steinitz is buried in the Cemetery of the Evergreens in Brooklyn, New York. His second wife and their two young children were still alive at his death.|$|E

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War II in 1939, and with the dissolution of her third marriage, Kalep began a new business venture in the American toy market. She designed a doll named Patsie Parachute which, when thrown into the air, would fall down slowly as a parachutist would. The dolls were produced <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> factory where Kalep herself was forced to work to sustain the business. Her health deteriorated, however, and her profits from the business were spent almost entirely on medical costs; {{she was forced to}} close the factory in 1946. She had recovered by 1950 and made a living by selling patents for toy designs to larger businesses. One of her successful designs was Scribbles Dolls—toy dolls with blank faces that could be individually decorated by children—which was inspired by the 50,000 doll heads she had left over from the closure of the Patsie Parachute factory.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the union dispute, many club patrons no longer visited the night spot. Those who were {{performers}} were informed of the possibility of fines and suspensions by their respective unions for crossing the Stork Club picket line as the issue continued. Many of Billingsley's friendships, including those of Walter Winchell and J. Edgar Hoover, were over as {{a result of}} the union problems. He began firing staff without good cause. As the dispute dragged on, there was also no longer a live band in the dining room for music; members of the Musicians' Union had crossed the picket line to perform for some time. Previously, the club had no need for advertising; it was mentioned frequently in print and word of mouth without it. In 1963, the club offered a hamburger and French fries for $1.99 <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Times advertisement; when those in the know about the club saw it, they realized the Stork Club's days were coming to an end. In the last few months of its operation, at times there were only three customers for the entire evening. On a good day in the mid-1940s, some 2,500 people visited the club.|$|E
5|$|Cena made a {{surprise}} return {{as the final}} participant of the Royal Rumble match, winning the match, and the traditional WrestleMania title shot, by last eliminating Triple H. Instead of waiting until WrestleMania, the title shot was cashed in against then WWE Champion Randy Orton at February's No Way Out pay-per-view in a match where Cena won by disqualification, resulting in him not getting the championship. The night after No Way Out, Cena was placed back into WrestleMania XXIV's WWE Championship match, making it a triple threat match also involving Triple H, during which he was pinned by Orton. At Backlash, Cena failed to regain the title in a fatal four-way elimination match, {{in which he was}} pinned by Orton. Triple H won the title during that match, during which Cena eliminated JBL, renewing their feud from 2005. Cena defeated JBL at Judgment Day and then at One Night Stand in a First Blood match. JBL, however, defeated him <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City Parking Lot Brawl at The Great American Bash in July. Cena also failed to regain the WWE Championship from Triple H at Night of Champions.|$|E

5|$|Lady Gaga: Queen of Pop has 288 pages, {{including}} 32 {{pages of}} photographs of the musician. The author compares Lady Gaga to Madonna, writing that both are independent and work to assert control over their futures. The book discusses Lady Gaga's early life and background, including her upbringing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City household with her father, a businessman. Born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta on March 28, 1986, from age 11 she attended Convent of the Sacred Heart high school; the same high school as Paris Hilton. Germanotta was not popular with her fellow pupils because of her experimentation with exotic dance, drugs, and bisexuality. By age 13, she had written her first song and her mother took her to nightclubs to perform at open-mic events. Germanotta gained entry to the Tisch School of the Arts in New York at age 17, but left and started using drugs while performing as a go-go dancer. After a period of difficulty with her father, she ceased this behavior pattern.|$|E

5|$|The Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson wrote Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in 1885 when he {{was living}} in Bournemouth, on England's south coast. In January 1886 the novella was {{published}} in the United Kingdom by Longmans, Green & Co. and by Charles Scribner's Sons in the United States, where it was frequently pirated {{because of the lack of}} copyright protection in the U.S. for works originally published in the UK. In early 1887, actor Richard Mansfield read Stevenson's novella and immediately got the idea to adapt it for the stage. Mansfield was looking for material that would help him achieve a reputation as a serious actor in the U.S., where he lived, and in England, where he had spent most of his childhood. He had played dual roles as a father and son <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> production of the operetta Rip Van Winkle, and saw another acting opportunity in playing Jekyll and Hyde.|$|E
