5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the war, emigration to Israel further decreased the Jewish population of Belgium, which as of 2011 was estimated at between 30,000 and 40,000. The population is still concentrated in Brussels and Antwerp, but new smaller communities (such as those in Ghent, Knokke, Waterloo and Arlon) have developed since 1945. Notable Belgian Holocaust survivors include François Englert, a joint recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2013, and Paul Lévy, a well-known journalist (who converted to Christianity) who was also responsible for the design of the <b>European</b> <b>flag.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{displayed}} alongside other flags, {{the national}} flag takes {{the position of}} honour; it is raised first and lowered last. Other national flags should be arranged in alphabetical order. Where two (or more than three) flags appear together, the national flag should be placed to the right (left of the observer); in a display of three flags in line, the national flag occupies the central position. The <b>European</b> <b>flag</b> is also flown from government buildings on a daily basis. In {{the presence of a}} foreign visitor belonging to a member state, this takes precedence over the Italian flag. As a sign of mourning, flags flown externally shall be lowered to half-mast; two black ribbons may be attached to those otherwise displayed. Traditionally, the flag may be decorated with a golden fringe surrounding the perimeter.|$|E

25|$|To fight an {{offensive}} war, the Confederacy purchased ships from Britain, converted them to warships, and raided American merchant {{ships in the}} Atlantic and Pacific oceans.

50|$|Unlike in many countries, Croatian design more {{commonly}} uses symbolism from the coat of arms, {{rather than from}} the Croatian flag. This is partly due to the geometric design of the shield which makes it appropriate for use in many graphic contexts (e.g. the insignia of Croatia Airlines or the design of the shirt for the Croatia national football team), and partly because the Pan-Slavic colors are present in many <b>European</b> <b>flags.</b>|$|R

25|$|It is {{the normal}} {{practice}} {{to fly the}} national flag daily at all military posts and from {{a limited number of}} important State buildings. The <b>European</b> <b>flag</b> is flown alongside the national flag on all official buildings, and in most places where the Irish flag is flown over buildings. The national flag is flown over buildings including: the residence of the President of Ireland, Áras an Uachtaráin; Leinster House, the seat of the Irish parliament, when parliament is in session; Irish courts and state buildings; Irish military installations, at home and abroad; and Garda Síochána (police) stations. The national flag is also flown on Saint Patrick's Day (the national holiday), Easter Sunday and Easter Monday (in commemoration of the Easter Rising of 1916), and the National Day of Commemoration on the Sunday closest to 11 July. On these occasions the national flag is flown from all State buildings throughout the country which are equipped with flagpoles, and many private individuals and concerns also fly it. The national flag is flown on the occasion of other significant national and local events such as festivals and commemorations. The national flag is frequently flown at half-mast on the death of a national or international figure on all prominent government buildings equipped with a flag pole. The death of a prominent local figure may be marked locally by the national flag being flown at half-mast. Where the national flag is flown at half-mast no other flag should be half-masted.|$|E

50|$|A drapo Vodou is a {{handmade}} flag, typically embroidered {{and decorated}} with beads and sequins.Although flags may {{have been made in}} West Africa before the arrival of <b>Europeans,</b> the <b>flags</b> widely used there by 1600 were derived from <b>European</b> <b>flags.</b> They were used as symbols of ethnic, military or religious allegiance.The drapo Vodou also drew on Yoruba beadwork, Catholic vestments and Masonic aprons.In the 19th century and early 20th century most drapo Vodou were made from one or two colored fabric pieces decorated with embroidery, metal bangles and glass beads, with an image of the lwa made of shiny fabrics appliquéd to the cloth using techniques still followed in West Africa.Flags and banners used in the 21st century in rural areas often still have stylistically simple designs, in part due to the high cost of decorative material.|$|R

2500|$|The rising {{expense of}} minting coins necessitated the {{introduction}} of the twenty pence coin in 1986; the halfpenny coin was withdrawn at this time as inflation had reduced its buying power. The introduction of the Irish pound coin required the Decimal Currency Act, 1990 and this law provided for certain other matters including the issue of European Currency Unit (ECU) coins which were specifically stated not to be legal tender in the legislation, instead intended as collectors items. [...] These ECU coins were issued in 50 ECU, 10 ECU and 5 ECU denominations, in gold, silver and silver respectively. These coins used the Irish red deer design from the Irish pound coin with a mountain relief in the background and other notable differences such as the 12 stars of the <b>European</b> <b>Flag</b> surrounding the harp, quite similar to the Irish euro coins.|$|E
