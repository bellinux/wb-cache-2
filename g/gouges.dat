5|$|In 2012, bite {{marks on}} two fragmentary gastralia of the holotype {{specimen}} {{of the large}} ornithomimosaur Deinocheirus mirificus were reported. The {{size and shape of}} the bite marks match the teeth of Tarbosaurus, the largest known predator from the Nemegt Formation. Various types of feeding traces were identified; punctures, <b>gouges,</b> striae, fragmentary teeth, and combinations of the above marks. The bite marks probably represent feeding behavior instead of aggression between the species, and the fact that bite marks were not found elsewhere on the body indicates the predator focused on internal organs. Tarbosaurus bite marks have also been identified on hadrosaur and sauropod fossils, but theropod bite marks on bones of other theropods are very rare in the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|The {{cylinder}} is inspected externally for dents, cracks, <b>gouges,</b> cuts, bulges, laminations {{and excessive}} wear, heat damage, torch or electric arc burns, corrosion damage, illegible, incorrect or unauthorised permanent stamp markings, and unauthorised additions or modifications. Unless the cylinder walls are examined by ultrasonic methods, the interior must be visually inspected using sufficient illumination {{to identify any}} damage and defects, particularly corrosion. If the inner surface is not clearly visible it should first be cleaned by an approved method which does not remove {{a significant amount of}} wall material. When there is uncertainty whether a defect found during visual inspection meets the rejection criteria, additional tests may be applied, such as ultrasonic measurement of pitting wall thickness, or weight checks to establish total weight lost to corrosion.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} 7 tests of PIRAM (Pipeline Ice Risk Assessment and Mitigation) tests {{were carried out}} to {{simulate}} the progress of a <b>gouging</b> ice keel by centrifuge modeling. This thesis focuses on the subgouge deformations of the ice <b>gouging</b> process. The relationships between <b>gouge</b> depth, frontal berm, force, pressure, subgouge deformation and vertical extent of subgouge deformation {{are discussed in the}} thesis. The PIRAM tests were compared with the results of a similar series of previously conducted tests, and previous tests. Significance of the frontal berm height, <b>gouge</b> depth, <b>gouge</b> rate are also discussed. [...] The experimental program consisted of towing a model ice keel across a model testbed at a set <b>gouge</b> depth under various centrifuge acceleration. The test setup consisted of an aluminum half width ice keel model mounted on a gantry situated on top of the containment box given the centerline of the model was replaced by a viewing window to visualize the subgouge deformation accumulation. The model tests were conducted using saturated fine sand simulating seabed. Two tests were conducted with shallow <b>gouge</b> depths for comparison with previous Delft Hydraulics flume medium scale <b>gouge</b> tests to evaluate the applicability of centrifuge modeling. Three tests were conducted at a fast <b>gouge</b> rate since most of the previous work were conducted at a relatively slow rate. A large amount of data regarding ice keel <b>gouge</b> in sand was acquired from the experimental program the analysis of which described here in. [...] The combined depth of <b>gouge</b> depth and frontal berm height has a significant effect on the force and subgouge deformation. The force per unit width increases as the <b>gouge</b> depth increases. The vertical to lateral <b>gouge</b> force ratio seems to be independent of the aspect ratio which is <b>gouge</b> width divide <b>gouge</b> depth or attack angle. The kappa value is the frontal berm height normalized by <b>gouge</b> depth is linear with the aspect ratio. The kappa value has a significant effect on <b>gouge</b> force and subgouge deformation. Particle image velocimetry (PlV) technique was successfully used to track the evolution of subgouge deformation in all 7 tests. The maximum horizontal subgouge displacement occurred {{at the base of the}} keel and decreased with depth. The associated maximum <b>gouge</b> forces are a function of the keel attack angle and the <b>gouge</b> geometry. In comparison with previous tests, the vertical extent of subgouge deformation (SGD) was a function of combined depth and the soil state, but independent of the attack angle. The SGD are influenced by the attack angle and the soil state. Faster <b>gouge</b> rates may result in larger <b>gouge</b> forces by a factor of 2 to 3 and smaller horizontal subgouge deformations but similar vertical extent...|$|R

25|$|Following de Condorcet's repeated, yet failed, {{appeals to}} the National Assembly in 1789 and 1790, Olympe de <b>Gouges</b> (in {{association}} with the Society of the Friends of Truth) authored and published the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen in 1791. This was another plea for the French Revolutionary government to recognize the natural and political rights of women. De <b>Gouges</b> wrote the Declaration in the prose of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, almost mimicking the failure of men to include {{more than a half}} of the French population in egalité. Even though,the Declaration did not immediately accomplish its goals, it did set a precedent for a manner in which feminists could satirize their governments for their failures in equality, seen in documents such as A Vindication of the Rights of Woman and A Declaration of Sentiments.|$|E

25|$|It is {{suggested}} that this newfound power resulting from women's taking revolutionary action, led {{to the death of}} some powerful women of this era, including Marie Antoinette, Olympe de <b>Gouges,</b> and Madame Roland.

25|$|Woodcut is {{a relief}} {{printing}} artistic technique in printmaking {{in which an}} image is carved into {{the surface of a}} block of wood, with the printing parts remaining level with the surface while the non-printing parts are removed, typically with <b>gouges.</b> The areas to show 'white' are cut away with a knife or chisel, leaving the characters or image to show in 'black' at the original surface level.

25|$|The {{explanation}} originally {{put forward}} by Ludwig Borchardt, and later expanded upon by other early 20th-century Egyptologists including Junker and Reisner, was that the reserve head served as a ritualistic substitute for the real head of the deceased, in case it was damaged.

Moulds were then taken from the reserve heads in plaster, and the <b>gouges</b> that appear {{on many of the}} heads, the seeming mutilation to the ears and the excess plaster that appears on {{at least one of the}} heads can be explained as the type of damage that would be expected by trying to remove tight-fitting plaster casts from a reserve head.|$|E
