The project included detailed water resources assessment studies, the analysis and selection of strategies and an action plan developed in consultation with various government stakeholders. From 2002 onwards a Water Resources Information Center in the Ministry of Irrigation has been established with the assistance of JICA. The center established <b>Geographical</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Systems</b> for the Barada Awaj Basin around Damascus and the coastal basins, including data on groundwater, surface water and water quality.|$|E

25|$|There {{have also}} been recent {{technological}} developments that will hopefully facilitate more accurate mapping of hookworm prevalence. Some researchers have begun to use <b>geographical</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) to examine helminth ecology and epidemiology. Brooker et al. utilized this technology to create helminth distribution maps of sub-Saharan Africa. By relating satellite derived environmental data with prevalence data from school-based surveys, {{they were able to}} create detailed prevalence maps. The study focused {{on a wide range of}} helminths, but interesting conclusions about hookworm specifically were found. As compared to other helminths, hookworm is able to survive in much hotter conditions and was highly prevalent throughout the upper end of the thermal range. Hopefully this information along with more detailed prevalence maps can lead to more effective public health measures.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{discusses}} traditional development {{models of}} GIS and proposes another model, <b>geographical</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> shell(GISS). Following {{the thought of}} GISS, a geographic information query tool(GIQT) is developed. GIQT's main purpose and menu structure are introduced, {{as well as the}} classification and encoding. This paper especially describes the implementation of &quot;two-direction multi-function query &quot; and &quot;compressed tree-like binary search &quot; in length. The indexing mechanism and search method greatly improve the efficiency of GIQT's functions.

In the future is possible to make a development for mobile application to import the data and use for viewing on mobile devices. Phases of the master science thesis work are: studying object modelling language, object models and standards internet services for linking object models, analyzing known object models for gas transmission data bases in <b>geographical</b> <b>information</b> <b>system,</b> choosing the best solution and implementing object model data bases of <b>geographical</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> in application SDMS (Spatial data management system).
