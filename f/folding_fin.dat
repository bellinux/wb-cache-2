40|$|The rapid {{advancement}} in technology of microprocessors has led electronics thermal system designers to pay increased {{attention to the}} <b>folded</b> <b>fin</b> heat sink. The advantages of using a <b>folded</b> <b>fin</b> heat sink are light weight, low profile, and small footprint. There are three manufacturing methods for bonding the <b>folded</b> <b>fin</b> {{to the base of}} heat sink: adhesive bonding, soldering, and brazing. Brazing is a high temperature process which takes place at around 550 °C. The major concern with using the brazing process to manufacture heat sinks is dimensional deformation. The adhesive process, on the other hand, requires only sub 200 °C or room temperature curing process. However, its thermal contact resistance at the joint is higher than others. Solder bonding is an alternative solution to the above problems. The soldering process requires much lower temperature, less than 200 °C, yet it gives excellent thermal contact and bond strength at the joint. This paper presents the theoretical study of thermal contact resistance at the joint between the <b>folded</b> <b>fin</b> base and the spreader plate of heat sink, and also presents the experimental results which support this theory...|$|R

40|$|Larvae of bony fish {{swim in the}} {{intermediate}} Reynolds number (Re) regime, using body- and caudal-fin undulation to propel themselves. They share a median <b>fin</b> <b>fold</b> that transforms into separate median fins as they grow into juveniles. The <b>fin</b> <b>fold</b> was suggested to be an adaption for locomotion in {{the intermediate}} Reynolds regime, but its fluid-dynamic role is still enigmatic. Using three-dimensional fluid-dynamic computations,we quantified the swimming trajectory frombody-shape changes during cyclic swimming of larval fish. We predicted unsteady vortices around {{the upper and lower}} edges of the <b>fin</b> <b>fold,</b> and identified similar vortices around real larvaewith particle image velocimetry. We show that thrust contributions on the body peak adjacent to the upper and lower edges of the <b>fin</b> <b>fold</b> where large left–right pressure differences occur in concert with the periodical generation and shedding of edge vortices. The <b>fin</b> <b>fold</b> enhances effective flow separation and drag-based thrust. Along the body, net thrust is generated in multiple zones posterior to the centre of mass. Counterfactual simulations exploring the effect of having a <b>fin</b> <b>fold</b> across a range of Reynolds numbers show that the <b>fin</b> <b>fold</b> helps larvae achieve high swimming speeds, yet requires high power. We conclude that propulsion in larval fish partly relies on unsteady high-intensity vortices along the upper and lower edges of the <b>fin</b> <b>fold,</b> providing a functional explanation for the omnipresence of the <b>fin</b> <b>fold</b> in bony-fish larvae...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we provide {{information}} {{on the development of}} the structure and composition of fins in the medaka. The pectoral fins, which begin to form in the embryonic stage, first form their fin rays after hatching prior to the formation of other median and pelvic fins. During the growth period from larvae to juveniles, the unpaired anal, caudal and dorsal fins begin to form before the pronounced degeneration or resorption of the median <b>fin</b> <b>fold</b> in the region of the caudal peduncle. The fin rays first appear in the caudal <b>fin</b> <b>fold</b> at the posterior end of the body, and subsequently fin rays of the anal and pectoral fins arise prior to those of the dorsal fin. Paired pelvic fins begin to sprout on the skin of the bilateral sides of a median ventral <b>fin</b> <b>fold,</b> which regresses concomitant with resorption of the <b>fin</b> <b>fold</b> at the dorsal and ventral regions of the caudal peduncle. After complete resorption of those portions of the ventral <b>fin</b> <b>fold</b> in which <b>fin</b> rays do not arise, the pelvic fin rays form. The pectoral fins are supported by four small radials, the scapulas and the coracoids. Similarly, the pelvic fins are supported by pelvic girdles, the caudal fin by the hypural, and the anal and dorsal fins by distal and proximal pterygiophores. The appearance of these fin appendages closely follows that of fin rays in the <b>fin</b> <b>fold...</b>|$|R

40|$|Solar {{radiation}} offers phenomenal {{potential for}} energy conversion with energy densities {{on the order}} of 1000 W/m 2 in locations with regularly clear skies. As always, the difficulty lies in finding a solar-electric conversion technology capable of producing electricity at a competitive cost. The SolarCAT (Solar Compressed Air Turbine) system produces electricity by releasing stored compressed air through a series of turbines with solar dish concentrators providing the required heat for efficient conversion to electricity. To minimize impact on capital cost, high recuperator effectiveness targets are sought but unlike typical fuel-fired micro-turbines, raising the recuperator effectiveness of the solar power system yields a benefit in overall system capital cost. Improving efficiency lowers the size and cost of the largest element of the system, namely the dish. In this study potential techniques for achieving a highly compact heat-transfer media were reviewed. <b>Folded</b> <b>fin,</b> packed beds, micro-tubes, lattice frame structures, metal foams, woven textile, and micro-machining techniques were assessed. Textile structures were selected as an appropriate medium to replace the internal <b>folded</b> <b>fin</b> of the SolarCAT recuperator. The relatively long flow (> 150 mm) path through the proposed screen wafers requires a model for fully-developed forced convective flow between parallel plates. A mathematical model was developed by integrating the results from the work of several authors in the field of textiles and porous media. # 100 mesh sintered screen wafers were brazed between two 0. 25 mm stainless steel sheets and destructively tested to assess their tensile strength. Although iii optimization of the braze parameters was not completed, it was found that many samples survived exposure to internal pressures in excess of 50 MPa. This study found that the use of sintered screen wafers to replace the internal <b>folded</b> <b>fin</b> of the SolarCAT recuperator would have advantages over the current design with respect to both overall recuperator effectiveness, size, and cost. Textile structures can be tailored to have wide range of fluid and heat-transfer properties depending on the application. The manufacturing process is relatively simple and could be cost-effective for high-volume production...|$|R

The first United States use of the armed helicopter in large-scale combat operations was during the Vietnam War. First the U.S. Army modified UH-1B 'Huey' helicopters, mounting machine guns and <b>Folding</b> <b>Fin</b> Aerial Rockets (FFAR) on struts parallel with the fuselage. Eventually, the U.S. Army would upgrade the engine and rotor to the UH-1C model, and again to the UH-1M model, to overcome power issues as more and more armament was added to the helicopters. But this was not fully satisfactory, so the AH-1 helicopter was developed.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{vertebrate}} <b>fin</b> <b>fold,</b> the presumptive evolutionary antecedent of the paired fins, {{consists of}} two layers of epidermal cells extending dorsally and ventrally over the trunk and tail of the embryo, facilitating swimming during the embryonic and larval stages. Development of the <b>fin</b> <b>fold</b> requires dramatic changes in cell shape and adhesion during early development, but the proteins involved in this process are completely unknown. In a screen of mutants defective in <b>fin</b> <b>fold</b> morphogenesis, we identified a mutant with a severe <b>fin</b> <b>fold</b> defect, which also displays malformed pectoral fins. We find {{that the cause of}} the defect is a non-sense mutation in the zebrafish lama 5 gene that truncates laminin α 5 before the C-terminal laminin LG domains, thereby preventing laminin α 5 from interacting with its cell surface receptors. Laminin is mislocalized in this mutant, as are the membrane-associated proteins, actin and β-catenin, that normally form foci within the <b>fin</b> <b>fold.</b> Ultrastructural analysis revealed severe morphological abnormalities and defects in cell–cell adhesion within the epidermis of the developing <b>fin</b> <b>fold</b> at 36  hpf, resulting in an epidermal sheet that can not extend away from the body. Examining the pectoral fins, we find that the lama 5 mutant is the first zebrafish mutant identified in which the pectoral fins fail to make the transition from an apical epidermal ridge to an apical fold, a transformation that is essential for pectoral fin morphogenesis. We propose that laminin α 5, which is concentrated at the distal ends of the fins, organizes the distal cells of the <b>fin</b> <b>fold</b> and pectoral <b>fins</b> in order to promote the morphogenesis of the epidermis. The lama 5 mutant provides novel insight into the role of laminins in the zebrafish epidermis, and the molecular mechanisms driving fin formation in vertebrates...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} mainly {{concerned}} {{with the impact of}} cellular mechanisms which influence a particular instance of tissue morphogenesis, namely development of the caudal fin of the zebra fish, Brachydanio rerio. Ultrastructural analysis of <b>fin</b> <b>fold</b> morphogenesis in situ reveals that specific changes in epidermal cell shaping occur as a transient ectodermal ridge is generated. The ridge is converted to a <b>fin</b> <b>fold</b> by further changes in cell shaping which are spatio-temporally associated with the deposition of extracellular matrix material. Microsurgical excisions of small portions of early folds support the suggestion that cell shape modulation and extracellular matrix organisation interact reciprocally during early fold formation. Studies using cytochalisin B show that actinoid microfilaments {{play an important role in}} generating the changes in epidermal cell shaping associated with <b>fin</b> <b>fold</b> morphogenesis. They also eJiminate the possibility that overlying peridermis and e(Xiermis which flank putative <b>fin</b> <b>folds</b> exert any great influence on the morphology of fold epidermis during apical ectodermal ridge generation. Furthermore, experiments employing tunicamycin indicate that cell adhesion and extracellular matrix deployment are partic. llarly important in converting the apical ectodermal ridge into a <b>fin</b> <b>fold</b> and in subsequent stabilisation of the early <b>fin</b> <b>fold.</b> Microtubules do not appear to influence early <b>fin</b> <b>fold</b> morphogenesis although they are important during a later phase of <b>fin</b> <b>fold</b> expansion. The spatial relationships between extracellular matrix orientation and cytoskeletal alignment in cell layers associated with the scales of certain teleosts have also been assessed. These studies have involved electron and immunufluorescence microscopy. They show that fibroblastic cells found at varying locations on the surfaces of scales display three types of micro- tubule arrays. Two of these arrays show intercellular alignment of microtubules which are spatially correlated with patterns of extracellular matrix deposition...|$|R
