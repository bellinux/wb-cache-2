5|$|Hearing is <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{nocturnal bird}} of prey, and {{as with other}} owls, the tawny owl's two ear {{openings}} differ in structure and are asymmetrically placed to improve directional hearing. A passage through the skull links the eardrums, and small differences {{in the time of}} arrival of a sound at each ear enables its source to be pinpointed. The left ear opening is higher on the head than the larger right ear and tilts downward, improving sensitivity to sounds from below. Both ear openings are hidden under the facial disk feathers, which are structurally specialized to be transparent to sound, and are supported by a movable fold of skin (the pre-aural flap).|$|E
25|$|Thus, by only {{considering}} {{states and}} features <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> particular reaction, rule-based model specification eliminates the need to explicitly enumerate every possible molecular state that can undergo a similar reaction, and thereby allows for efficient specification.|$|E
25|$|When {{dribbling}} past an opponent, the dribbler should dribble {{with the}} hand farthest from the opponent, {{making it more difficult}} for the defensive player to get to the ball. It is therefore <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> player to be able to dribble competently with both hands.|$|E

25|$|Broadleaved trees re-grow as a coppice, {{providing}} easy-to-reach {{stems and}} leaves for food in subsequent years. Ponds created by beavers can also kill some tree species by drowning, but this creates standing dead wood, {{which is very}} <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> wide range of animals and plants.|$|E
25|$|There is much {{evidence}} that statistical learning {{is an important}} component of both discovering which phonemes are <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> given language and which contrasts within phonemes are important. Having this knowledge is important for aspects of both speech perception and speech production.|$|E
25|$|It {{also seems}} that the {{prestige}} of Padre Martini, who was considered the most knowledgeable European expert {{on the art of}} music, was so great that it was <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> musician of that time to have their portrait in his gallery. This served as a recognition of the musician's merit.|$|E

25|$|Besides direct {{transfection}} of dendritic {{cells or}} macrophages, cross priming occurs following IM, ID and gene gun DNA deliveries. Cross-priming {{occurs when a}} bone marrow-derived cell presents peptides from proteins synthesised in another cell {{in the context of}} MHC class 1. This can prime cytotoxic T-cell responses and seems to be <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> full primary immune response.|$|E
25|$|Boiling, steaming, and {{simmering}} {{are popular}} cooking methods that often require immersing food in water or its gaseous state, steam. Water {{is also used}} for dishwashing. Water also plays many critical roles {{within the field of}} food science. It is <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> food scientist to understand the roles that water plays within food processing to ensure the success of their products.|$|E
25|$|Gender typing is {{the process}} by which a child becomes aware of their gender and thus behaves {{accordingly}} by adopting values and attributes of members of the sex that they identify as their own. This process is extremely <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> child’s social and personality development because it largely impacts the child’s understanding of expected social behaviour and influences social judgments.|$|E

40|$|The embodied, embedded, enactive, and {{extended}} approaches to cognition explicate many <b>important</b> details <b>for</b> <b>a</b> phenomenology of perception, and {{are consistent with}} some of the traditional phenomenological analyses. Theorists working in these areas, however, often fail to provide an account of how intersubjectivity might relate to perception. This paper suggests some ways in which intersubjectivity is <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> adequate account of perception...|$|R
25|$|A {{treatise}} On Sense Perception (Περὶ αἰσθήσεων) and its objects is <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{knowledge of}} the doctrines of the more ancient Greek philosophers regarding the subject. A paraphrase and commentary on this work was written by Priscian of Lydia in the sixth century. With this type of work we may connect the fragments on Smells, on Fatigue, on Dizziness, on Sweat, on Swooning, on Palsy, and on Honey.|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{increase}} remittances from Peruvians abroad, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs under Toledo sought to strengthen the link between Peruvian migrants and their homeland {{through the creation of}} advisory councils. The issue is especially <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> country which experienced a massive emigration of professionals under Fujimori and which still has 10% of its population living abroad. The councils were also part of an effort by the first Minister of Foreign Affairs, García Sayan, to professionalize the foreign service.|$|E
25|$|British railway {{signalling}} {{is unusual}} in that it employs the direction signalling philosophy, rather than that of speed signalling; in other words, a driver is informed of which route he will take at a junction, rather than {{the speed at which}} he should travel through it. This probably stems from the early days of railways when points and signals were not interlocked, and it was therefore <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> driver to know whether the points had been correctly set for him or not, and has stuck ever since.|$|E

25|$|Linkage {{analysis}} may {{be either}} parametric (if {{we know the}} relationship between phenotypic and genetic similarity) or non-parametric. Parametric linkage analysis is the traditional approach, whereby {{the probability that a}} gene <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> disease is linked to a genetic marker is studied through the LOD score, which assesses the probability that a given pedigree, where the disease and the marker are cosegregating, is due to the existence of linkage (with a given linkage value) or to chance. Non-parametric linkage analysis, in turn, studies the probability of an allele being identical by descent with itself.|$|E
25|$|The site is <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} reasons. First, {{while it was}} {{definitely}} inhabited by Mixe-Zoque speakers, it has strong ties to the Olmecs, {{but it is not}} known what exactly theses ties were. Some theories state that the population was genetically related to the Olmecs, while others suppose that they were dominated by the Olmecs initially but then eventually broke away. There have been significant finds here such as the oldest Mesoamerican Long Count calendar with the date of 36 BCE on a monument, as well as a pottery shard with the oldest instance of writing system yet discovered.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{evidence}} that fetal memory may begin within the second trimester after conception. Substantial evidence for fetal memories has been found at around 30 weeks after conception. Fetal memory is important for parental recognition, and facilitates the bond between child and parents. One of the most important types of memory is that which stores information contributing to the maternal bond between infant and mother. This form of memory is <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> type of development known as attachment. Fetal memory is thus critical to the survival of the fetus both prenatally (in the womb) and after birth as an infant.|$|E

25|$|Primary education, or Volksschule, {{lasts for}} four years, {{starting}} at age six. The maximum class size is 30, {{but may be}} as low as 15. It is generally expected that a class will be taught by one teacher for the entire four years and the stable bond between teacher and pupil is considered <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> child's well-being. The 3Rs (Reading, wRiting and aRithmetic) dominate lesson time, with less time allotted to project work than in the UK. Children work individually and all members of a class follow the same plan of work. There is no streaming.|$|E
25|$|The {{air intake}} {{was in the}} unusual dorsal {{location}} as the Air Force had required the carriage of an underbelly semi-conformal nuclear weapon. Some sources claim that the original chin intake caused a shock wave that interfered in launching this weapon, but no such testing was actually carried out. The implications this design choice had for the survivability of the pilot during ejection were troubling. The intake also severely limited rear visibility. Nonetheless this was not considered terribly <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> tactical fighter-bomber aircraft, and furthermore it was assumed {{at the time that}} air combat would be via guided missile exchanges outside visual range.|$|E
25|$|By rationally {{seeking the}} truth, {{thinking}} freely, holding free discussions and testing teachings and authorities, freethinkers strive towards the full {{development of the}} human personality, {{with the emphasis on}} moral and rational conscience. This includes amongst other things an atheistic worldview, the choice for solidarity with fellow human beings, and the realisation that life is finite and a one-off occurrence. Also, physical and emotional development is considered <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> healthy and happy life. Precisely because life is finite, it is unique and valuable, and should be experienced to the fullest. Emotionally, one needs to cope with doubt, because the critical examination of one's own dearly held beliefs, and letting go of them if they turn out to be false, is necessary to seek the truth.|$|E
30|$|Decentralized {{approaches}} are good enough <b>for</b> applications involving <b>a</b> {{small number of}} states such as tracking of objects, etc. But problems such as parametric sampling involve hundreds of parameters, and hence distributing the KF filter becomes all the more <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> efficient operation.|$|R
