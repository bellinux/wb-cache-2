40|$|Focusing on {{employment}} issues, this paper investigates {{the impact of}} government control on state-owned enterprise's (SOE) <b>excess</b> <b>employment,</b> and hence on its performance and the compensation-based incentive mechanism. The {{results show that the}} <b>excess</b> <b>employment</b> in SOEs does not result in a substantial increase in labour cost, but a significant decrease in average employees' compensation, including their top managers' unexpectedly. In addition, we find that the government imposed <b>excess</b> <b>employment</b> has significantly reduced the sensitivity of those enterprises' top managers' concern on their compensation over firms' performance. This suggests that negative impact of <b>excess</b> <b>employment</b> is not from the extra labour cost incurred, but from the impairment on compensation-based incentive mechanism, and in turn an increase in the agency cost of management. As such, this paper concludes that effective control of the political pressure is crucial for the success of the reform of SOEs in transition economies, including China.

As we will see, the case for such a “citizens’ income” is even stronger for HRCs than for mid-rent countries: while retaining most of the redeeming features that cash grants are argued to have in the rentier state universe at large, they would be easier to finance and justify, involve less acute trade-offs, and most importantly help overcome HRC-specific development challenges.|$|R

The consequences of these disastrous policies persist well after the policies themselves have been suspended and continue to shape labor markets in the long term. They include the large overhang of <b>excess</b> <b>employment</b> in the public sector, the existence of large stocks of inappropriate human capital, one of the longest lived assets in the economy, continued institutional distortions in education systems, which continue to be oriented toward credentialism rather than skill formation, and distorted expectations among young job seekers that lead to queuing for public sector jobs and high youth unemployment. Female job seekers are more affected by this kind of labor market dualism because of the more limited opportunities they face in the private sector, the bigger wedge they face between their market clearing wage and their potential compensation in the public sector, and their reluctance to take up informal employment that could threaten their sexual and reputational safety. As such they face higher unemployment rates and, more recently, increasing discouragement from participating in the workforce altogether.|$|E

40|$|Background: Increased {{cancer risk}} has been {{reported}} among workers in the rubber manufacturing industry employed before the 1960 s. It is unclear whether risk remains increased among workers hired subsequently. The present study focused on risk of cancer mortality for rubber workers first employed since 1975 in 64 factories. Patients and methods: Anonymized data from cohorts of rubber workers employed for at least 1 year from Germany, Italy, Poland, Sweden, and the UK were pooled. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), based on country-specific death rates, were reported for bladder and lung cancer (primary outcomes of interest), for other selected cancer sites, and for cancer sites {{with a minimum of}} 10 deaths in men or women. Analyses stratified by type of industry, period, and duration of employment were carried out. Results: A total of 38 457 individuals (29 768 men; 8689 women) contributed to 949 370 person-years. No increased risk of bladder cancer was observed [SMR = 0. 80, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 46; 1. 38]. The risk of lung cancer death was reduced (SMR = 0. 81, 95 % CI 0. 70; 0. 94). No statistically significant increased risk was observed for any other cause of death. A reduced risk was evident for total cancer mortality (SMR = 0. 81, 95 % CI 0. 76; 0. 87). Risks were lower for workers in the tyre industry compared with workers in the general rubber goods sector. Analysis by employment duration showed a negative trend with SMRs decreasing with increasing duration of employment. In an analysis of secondary end points, when stratified by type of industry and period of first <b>employment,</b> <b>excess</b> risks of myeloma and gastric cancer were observed each due, essentially, to results from one centre.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the strong output {{decline in the}} countries of Central and Eastern Europe. It starts from the puzzling observation that the former CSFR, Hungary and Poland experienced a relatively similar decline in output in spite of completely different stabilization and transformation policies. Using an aggregate supply/demand (AS/AD) framework it can be shown that there are obvious `real' causes for an output drop. The command economy was characterized by a dual disequilibrium (labour market and goods market). The removal of the high <b>excess</b> <b>employment</b> leads to an inevitable drop of natural output and employment together with a reduction of real wages. This is amplified by a downward shift of the production function, mainly {{because of lack of}} corporate governance. With very flexible nominal wages, the transitional economy can be represented by the `classical' version of the AS/AD model, which suggests that the theoretical basis for demand-side explanations is rather weak. This supply-side view is compatible with the popular explanation given by Calvo and Coricelli, but their evidence for a `credit crunch' in Poland is not very strong. The paper also {{discusses the}} `Soviet trade shock' as a possible cause for the output drop. It shows that Hungary and Poland [...] and to some extent the CSFR [...] were able to compensate their loss of CMEA exports by expanding their exports to the West, so that an overall trade shock cannot be observed. The `classical' explanation of the output decline rules out policies stimulating demand. What is required is a framework enhancing the transfer of resources from state-owned enterprises to the emerging private sector.

40|$|This paper {{starts from}} {{two sets of}} facts about Continental Europe. The first is the steady {{increase}} in unemployment since the early 1970 s. The second is {{the evolution of the}} capital share, an initial decline in the 1970 s, followed by a much larger increase since the mid- 1980 s. The paper then develops a model of capital accumulation, unemployment and factor prices. Using this model to look at the data, it reaches two main conclusions: The initial increase in unemployment, from the mid- 1970 s to the mid- 1980 s, was mostly due to a failure of wages to adjust to the slowdown in underlying factor productivity growth. The initial effect was to decrease profit rates and capital shares. Over time, the reaction of firms was to reduce capital accumulation and move away from labor, leading to a steady increase in unemployment, and a recovery of the capital share. The reason why wage moderation, clearly evident in the data since the mid- 1980 s, has not led to a decrease in unemployment is that another type of shift has been at work, this time on the labor demand side. At a given wage and a given capital stock firms have steadily decreased employment. The effect of this adverse shift in labor demand has been to lead to both continued high unemployment, and increasing capital shares. What lies behind this shift in labor demand? There are two potential lines of explanation. The first is shifts in the distribution of rents away from workers, for example, the elimination of chronic <b>excess</b> <b>employment</b> by firms. The second explanation points to technological bias: firms in Continental Europe are introducing technologies biased against labor and towards capital. ...|$|E
40|$|This work {{suggests}} {{a connection between}} the lack of restructuring of the privatized firms in transition and the high level of regulatory barriers faced by the private sector. In this work I suggest that the potential entry of the newly created private firms significantly affects the incentives of the privatized firms regarding restructuring. Since the entry of new businesses is threatening to the inefficient existing enterprises, managers of these enterprises have an incentive to use their political power to restrict the new entry. Given that the restructuring often involves politically unpopular measures, such as shedding of excess labor, politicians may prefer to see no restructuring of the privatized firms, thus creating a possibility for the privatized enterprises to lobby with politicians for the creation of entry barriers. The first chapter presents the background on privatization and restructuring in transition and reviews the existing literature on the subject. It also outlines the argument for the connection between new entry and the behavior of the existing enterprises. The second chapter presents an analytical model that investigates the conditions under which managers of the existing enterprises are likely to be successful in lobbying with politicians for the restriction of new entry. This chapter also discusses some examples of policies that would make such lobbying less likely, thus bringing an economy closer to the efficient equilibrium with more restructuring and low entry barriers. The third chapter uses data from the World Business Environment Survey to explore whether the threat of new entry induces managers of the existing firms to lobby with politicians, resulting in high entry barriers and low restructuring by the existing firms. Specifically, I investigate how the competition created by the new entrants affects the probability that high regulatory barriers are erected. The results indicate that the presence of <b>excess</b> <b>employment</b> (i. e. lack of restructuring) at the existing firms coincides with the new entrants facing high regulatory barriers. Furthermore, higher competition from the new entrants may result in new firms facing higher entry barriers, lending support to the argument that the level of regulatory barriers is influenced by the existing firms via lobbying...|$|E

The results show that an effort of raising employment by the government eventually leads to a reduction in the total welfare by curbing private employment. This chapter contributes to the existing literature by providing a different approach by defining an explicit outside option, namely the government sector, to the efficiency wage theory. Another aspect analyzed is the relation between public sector employment and output growth. In chapter three, I try to establish a link between the government employment and economic growth rate underlying several mechanisms; distortionary taxes, productive government expenditure and productivity link resulting from the interaction of government and private labour markets inspiring from the efficiency wage theory. I endogenize the growth rate by introducing a public sector capital term in government expenditures. The production function in the growth model is constructed such that productivity of private worker decreases when size of public employment increases. I concluded that the abundant government employment force private sector either to pay higher wages or to have lower productivity of labour as outside option for the workers are now plenty. While higher wage leads more unemployment, productivity decline causes output to reduce. Developing countries social dynamics have unforeseen consequences on the labour markets. Thus, in order to understand the social and traditional values explaining the employment decisions taken by the labour force in the developing countries, in the fourth chapter of this thesis an empirical study is carried out to investigate the existence of and the potential behavioral change in son preference in Turkey, by using different statistical techniques. The main contribution of this part is that, it provides a broad analysis of son preference behavior in Turkey by using the latest econometric techniques. In particular, it investigates whether the process of urbanization and modernization in Turkey had an effect on son preference behavior over time. The results imply that there is clear and strong son preference in Turkey and the difference between progression ratios of families with and without sons is larger in 1993 compared to 1998. It is also found that the regional effects are more dominant on childbearing decision and urbanization had a diminishing effect on son preference behavior in Turkey.

The regionalisation of the regional rail passenger services is of a special importance to us. We scrutinise the contracts for the provision of these services and try to find interrelations between the different contract elements. A further emphasis is placed on the influence of the European Commission on the reform process. We analyse the European Commissions policy on railway infrastructure charges and the charging principles to be found in the member states. In the following we summarise the contents of the three subsequent chapters. In chapter 2, we analyse the rail reform process that started in the year 1994. Our focus is set on the long-distance passenger transport and the freight transport, while the regional rail passenger transport is left to chapter 3. We identify the main stakeholders and their interests. The negotiations between the politicians and the managers of the railway company in the reform process are analysed using a bargaining model. Assuming opportunistic behaviour of politicians, we explain some issues of the railway reform in Germany. We adapt a model which was developed by Shleifer & Vishny in 1994. Public firms are seen as a vehicle for the government to win elections. State-owned enterprises produce benefits for the politicians in the form of <b>excess</b> <b>employment</b> or other output. If the government chooses to cut its control over the firm, there is still the possibility to influence the firm by subsidies. We present some evidence that the model’s prediction were realised with the corporatisation in 1994. It can be acknowledged as far as the employment is concerned, as it rapidly decreased after 1994. In long-distance passenger transport and in freight transport, restructuring processes were pursued. The performance in both segments decreased after 1994, at least in terms of market shares. There is also evidence that infrastructure was closed down after the commercialisation. However, the effect of the commercialisation on the infrastructure is not as eminent as for the employment or the transport services, as a total closing down of rail infrastructure has to be approved by the authorities. Another question is whether the commercialisation of the DB AG led to an increase in subsidies, as predicted by the model. We find that the model’s predictions are ambiguous if there is a simultaneous increase in the political costs of subsidies, which is quite likely to have happened. As a part of the reform of the German rail sector, the organisation of the local and regional rail services was changed in 1996. The intention was to create a more transparent procurement of the transport services. In chapter 3, we describe the institutional framework and the market structure. Our special focus is on the design of the contracts between the public authorities and the railway undertakings. These contracts are analysed using a unique data base. They exhibit a remarkable heterogeneity not only in terms of duration and network size but also concerning the degree of service specification and risk allocation. We try to establish interrelations between some design features of the contracts. In a first regression, we find that the contract duration is dependent on the annual train kilometres, the time span between the publishing of the tender and the start of the services, and the provision of public instruments to mitigate the risk from rolling stock investment. For a second estimation, we create a measure for the completeness of the service contracts. We find that the completeness is determined by the time span between the publishing of the tender and the start of the services, the provision of demand information, and the obligation to become a member of the regional public transport association. The rail infrastructure of each of the European Union’s member states is used by different rail undertakings. The allocation of this infrastructure capacity is done using charging systems. The European Commission has strived to open the railway markets since the beginning of the 1990 s by influencing the price regulation. The core element of the “First Railway Package” was a directive to shape the charging systems across the member states. In chapter 4, we identify standard pricing principles do be used for rail infrastructure. The economic aims of the pricing principles are contrasted with the content of the above mentioned directive. Scrutinizing the charging systems of different member states it is found that there is a broad variety in terms of the level of charges and their structure. We use the theoretical and empirical findings to formulate recommendations to enhance the rail infrastructure charging systems...|$|E
