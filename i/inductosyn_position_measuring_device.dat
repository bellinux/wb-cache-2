Forty bench press exercise trials were analyzed simultaneously, performed by 3 different subjects (age: 26. 74 ± 1. 2 years, height: 175. 74 ± 4. 04 cm, weight: 78. 7 ± 3. 35 kg) at maximum velocity (25 kg additional load). Three simple linear regression models were developed, supplied by the LPM on the basis of the AC data. The assumption of independence of errors was compared by means of the Durban-Watson test, and partial autocorrelation coefficients were established at an overall p < 0. 05 significance level. It has not been possible to confirm the presence of a general correlation between the measurements of both devices.

40|$|Abstract. One {{interesting}} {{scenario in}} personal positioning involves an energy-conscious mobile user {{who tries to}} obtain estimates about his po-sitions with sufficiently high confidence while consuming as little battery energy as possible. Besides obtaining estimates directly from a <b>position</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>device,</b> the user can rely on extrapolative calculations based on a user movement model and a known initial estimate. Because each measuring probe usually incurs a substantially higher cost than the ex-trapolative calculation, {{the objective is to}} minimize the overall cost of the measurement probes. Assuming that the user moves at a normally-distributed velocity, we consider two scenarios which differ in the probing devices used. In the first scenario, only one probing device is used. In this case, the aim is to minimize the total number of probes required. In the second scenario, two types of positioning devices are given, where one type of devices offers a higher positioning precision, but also at a greater probing cost. In this case, the aim is to choose an optimal combination of probes from the two types of devices. For both scenarios, we present algorithms for determining the minimum-cost probing sequences. The algorithms are computationally efficient in reducing the searching space of all possible probing sequences. Our ap-proach is based on Kalman Filtering theory which allows to integrate estimates obtained from the measurements and the extrapolative cal-culations. The variances in the estimates can provably stay below the specified level throughout the journey. To the best of our knowledge, these results appear to be the first that uses a mathematically rigorous approach to minimize the probing cost while guaranteeing the quality of estimates in personal positioning. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the use of logic-based {{switching}} in the control of imprecisely modeled nonlinear systems. Each control system considered consists of a continuous-time dynamical process to be controlled, a family of candidate controllers, and an event-driven switching logic. The need for switching arises when no single candidate controller is capable, by itself, of guaranteeing good performance when connected with a poorly modeled process. In this thesis we develop provably correct switching strategies capable of determining in real-time which candidate controller should be put in feedback with a process so as to achieve a desired closed-loop performance. The resulting closed-loop systems are hybrid in the sense that in each case, continuous dynamics interact with event-driven logic. In the process of designing these switching algorithms, we develop several tools for the analysis and synthesis of hybrid systems. Some of these tools also find application in the design of nonadaptive logic-based switching controllers for systems like the “nonholonomic integrator”, a model that, although locally null controllable, is not stabilizable by smooth, time-invariant control laws. Poorly modeled sensors are also considered in this thesis. In our study of imprecisely modeled sensors we focus on the problem of positioning a robot using a pair of cameras acting as a <b>position</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>device.</b> We derive conditions that enable one to decide on the basis of images acquired by an imprecisely modeled two-camera system, whether or not a prescribed robot positioning task has been precisely accomplished.

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{relevance of}} clinical and radiological objectivation of segment {{instability in the}} degenerative lumbar spine is very controversially discussed. The diagnosis lumbar segment instability is often the reason for complicated fusion operations. The clinical results of this surgical intervention are largely dependent on the correct diagnosis and require above all objective data. In the project presented here, we first examined {{the accuracy of the}} radiological examination currently regarded as the gold standard. Subsequently we developed a new measuring procedure for recording force-displacement curves. In part I of the study, we were able to demonstrate that the percentual agreement achieved in multiple assessments of lateral functional images under routine clinical conditions is lower than anticipated. The high scattering of the measurement values in repeated examinations resulted in 38. 7 % agreement for angulatory and 49 % for translatory procedures with an acceptable deviation of +/- 1 mm and +/- 1 °. This assessment should thus be used with caution in the clinical routine. In part II of the study, we developed a procedure that connects directly to the lumbar movement segment via polyaxial pedicle screws. At the present time, the prerequisites required for <b>positioning</b> the <b>measuring</b> <b>device</b> can only be achieved by using a polyaxial headlocking combination screw (MOSS-MAX, DePuy). The <b>measuring</b> <b>device</b> developed in part III of the study realizes the required measurement of force and displacement data at the same time. The <b>measuring</b> <b>device</b> was tested on native human whole-body samples. The force-displacement curves were simultaneously established in flexion, in left and right rotation as well as in dorsal translation of the cranial and caudal vertebra. Evaluation of the data showed reproducible measuring data for forces and displacements in all examined degrees of freedom. Calculation of segmental stiffnesses flexibility coefficients under stable and unstable segment conditions yielded the expected significant reduction of stiffness after laminectomy and a significantly increased flexibility coefficient in the unstable situation. These values can also be reproduced with sufficient accuracy. Thus it was possible to develop a completely novel measurement procedure for assessing segmental stability. This procedure cannot only be intraoperatively applied but enables {{for the first time the}} simultaneous recording of data for loads (forces or moments) and displacements (places or angles) in a flexional, rotational or translational direction.

40|$|Abstract Despite {{the large}} amount of {{research}} work in condition based maintenance and condition monitoring methods, there is still a need for more reliable and accurate methods. The clear evidence of that need is the continued dependence on time based maintenance, especially for critical applications such as turbomachinery and airplane engines. The lack of accurate condition monitoring systems could lead to not only the unexpected failures as well as the resulting hazards and repair costs, but also a huge waste of material and time because of unnecessary replacement due to false alarms and unnecessary repair and maintenance. Temperature change is a phenomenon that accompanies every dynamic activity in the universe. However, it has not been adequately exploited for mechanical system condition monitoring. The reason is the slow response of current temperature monitoring systems compared to other condition monitoring methods such as vibration analysis. Many references inferred that the change in temperature is not sensible until approaching the end of the monitored component life and even the whole system life (Kurfess, et al., 2006; Randall, 2011; Patrick, et al., March 7 - 14, 2009). On the other hand, the most commonly used condition monitoring method, i. e., vibration analysis, is not free from pitfalls. Although vibration analysis has shown success in detecting some bearing faults, for other faults like lubrication problems and gradual wear it is much less effective. Also, it does not give a reliable indication of fault severity for many types of bearing faults. The advancement of thermography as a temperature monitoring tool encourages the reconsideration of temperature monitoring for mechanical system fault detection. In addition to the improved accuracy and responsiveness, it has the advantage of non-contact monitoring which eliminates the need for complex sensor mounting and wiring especially for rotating components. Therefore, in current studies the thermography-based monitoring method is often used either as a distinct method or as a complementary tool to vibration analysis in an integrated condition monitoring system. The main objectives of this study are hence to: 1. 	Define heat sources in the rolling element bearings and overview two of the most famous bearing temperature calculation methods. 2. 	Setup a bearing test rig that is equipped with both vibration and temperature monitoring systems. 3. 	Develop a temperature calculation analytical model for rolling element bearing that include both friction calculation and heat transfer models. The friction calculated by the model will be compared to that calculated using the pre-defined empirical methods. The heat transfer model is used for bearing temperature calculation that will be compared to the experimental measurement using different temperature monitoring devices. 4. 	Propose a new in-band signal enhancement technique, based on the synchronous averaging technique, Autonomous Time Synchronous Averaging (ATSA) that does not need an angular <b>position</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>device.</b> The proposed method, in addition to the Spectral Kurtosis based band selection, will be used to enhance the bearing envelope analysis. 5. 	Propose a new method for classification of the bearing faults based on the fault severity and the strength of impulsiveness in vibration signals. It will be used for planning different types of tests using both temperature and vibration methods. 6.

Data is collected in relation to an internal coordinate system and therefore to collect data where the scanner is in motion the position of the scanner must be determined. The position can be determined by the scanner using reference features on the surface being scanned (typically adhesive reflective tabs, but natural features have been also used in research work) or by using an external tracking method. External tracking often {{takes the form of a}} laser tracker (to provide the sensor position) with integrated camera (to determine the orientation of the scanner) or a photogrammetric solution using 3 or more cameras providing the complete six degrees of freedom of the scanner. Both techniques tend to use infra red light-emitting diodes attached to the scanner which are seen by the camera(s) through filters providing resilience to ambient lighting.|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a process and a device for the generation of coaxial lines of identical electrical length. A <b>measuring</b> <b>device</b> determines the differential delays of electrical signals in a reference coaxial line and in the coaxial line to be measured and processed. The corresponding physical length resulting from this is calculated for the coaxial line to be processed. The <b>measuring</b> <b>device</b> controls directly the cutting device for positioning and cutting the coaxial line to be processed to a physical length which corresponds to the conversion value calculated by the <b>measuring</b> <b>device</b> {{in relation to the}} two coaxial lines. A path length <b>measuring</b> <b>device</b> assigned to the cutting device controls the end of the positioning operation and the initiation of the cutting operation by means of a cutting devic...|$|R
