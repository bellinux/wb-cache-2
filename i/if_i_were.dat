HeadGum includes 11 podcasts, {{many of which are}} hosted by comedians who were involved with CollegeHumor, including Streeter Seidell and Josh Ruben. Some of the notable program that {{can be found on the}} network includes Blumenfeld's very own <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>Were</b> You podcast, The Talk of Shame, and Gilmore Guys.|$|E

I became friends with him when I was young. And his persona is very strong. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> {{to look back and}} see his impact on my life, it’s been tremendous.|$|E
5|$|Ramachandran {{had dreamed}} of making his own film ever since he {{attended}} a screening of Frank Lloyd's historical drama, <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>Were</b> King (1938) starring Ronald Colman, in Calcutta. This occurred while he was playing a minor role in Maya Machhindra (1939). He wished {{to make a film}} that would express his political views and interests to the people of Tamil Nadu. To this end, he assembled a team of three people: R. M. Veerappan, V. Lakshmanan and S. K. T. Sami. He gave them suggestions about the outline of the story and urged them to watch <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>Were</b> King and two other films: The Prisoner of Zenda (1937), another Colman film, and Elia Kazan's Viva Zapata! (1952). After several brainstorming sessions, the team came up with a story loosely based on the three films and decided on the title Nadodi Mannan. The trio then helped make it look more Indian.|$|E

5|$|The idea {{going in}} was to {{juxtapose}} my singing style with a hardcore hip-hop sensibility {{and have the}} finished product still sound like a Madonna record. I began the process by meeting with the hip-hop producers whose work I most admired. It was important, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> to {{use a variety of}} collaborators, that the end product sound cohesive and thematically whole. I wasn't interested in the variety pack approach.|$|E

5|$|Nadodi Mannan was {{inspired}} by films such as The Prisoner of Zenda, <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>Were</b> King and Viva Zapata!. Ramachandran, in an account about the film he wrote in 1959, mentioned three specific differences from The Prisoner of Zenda. In the original, the look-alike and the queen have an intimate relationship while in Nadodi Mannan, Veerangan rejects Manohari's advances. When she realises that Veerangan is not Marthandan, she addresses him as her brother instead. Secondly, the look-alike {{was related to the}} king and shared the same interests. Veerangan is not related to Marthandan and initially has contrasting qualities until they meet. Thirdly, the character of Vijayavarman, and the sequences in Kanni Theevu, do not feature in the original, while these were incorporated as part of Nadodi Mannans main plot.|$|E

25|$|The {{play was}} written in January 2006, {{initially}} with the title <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>Were</b> You, which was then altered to I to I before reverting to the original. However, there were no plans to produce the play that year, as the Stephen Joseph Theatre already planned to produce revivals of Intimate Exchanges and Woman in Mind. However, on 21 February 2006, Alan Ayckbourn suffered a stroke. As a result, directorship of Intimate Exchanges passed to Tim Luscombe, {{and the production of}} Woman in Mind was eventually dropped altogether. Whilst in hospital, Ayckbourn decided to use his latest play as a goal to work towards. I to I was scheduled for the autumn slot vacated by Woman in Mind in June, rehearsed at the rehearsal studio at his home, and the play was announced to the public, now retitled as <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>Were</b> You, in July.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} argued that <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>Were</b> You is part of a trend of Ayckbourn's adult plays taking {{inspiration}} from his family plays (in this case, The Jollies, which also deals with the adjustments and insights of being someone else) – the first example being Improbable Fiction and its derivation from The Boy Who Fell into A Book and My Very Own Story.|$|E
