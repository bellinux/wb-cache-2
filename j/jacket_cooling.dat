With the increase of water spraying flux, the gas temperature and the evaporation rate of water droplets tend to decrease.

Appropriate modeling for predicting thermal behavior of battery systems in vehicles helps to make decisions for improved design and shortens the development process. For this paper, {{we looked at the}} impact of cooling strategies with air and direct/indirect liquid cooling. The simplicity of an air-cooling system is an advantage over a liquid-cooling system. In addition to its intrinsically lower heat transfer coefficient, another disadvantage of air cooling is that the small heat capacity of air makes it difficult to accomplish temperature uniformity inside a cell or between cells in a module. Liquid-cooling is more effective in heat transfer and takes up less volume, but the added complexity and cost may outweigh the merits. The surface heat transfer coefficient, h, and the blower power for air cooling are sensitive to the hydraulic diameter of the cooling channel (Dh). However, because of the added thermal resistances, h evaluated at cell surface is not as sensitive to the variation of Dh in an indirect (water/glycol <b>jacket)</b> <b>cooling</b> system. Due to the high heat transfer coefficient at small Dh, direct liquid cooling using dielectric mineral oils may be preferred in spite of high pressure loss in certain circumstances such as in highly transient large heat generating battery systems. In general, air-cooling should be considered first, as the power demand increases with heavier vehicles and more aggressive driving, water/glycol <b>jacket</b> <b>cooling</b> should be considered next.

The key to enhance thermal performance of the motor here is based on introducing fluid guiding structure in the slot channels. Next, heat transfer in the channel with guiding structure is investigated by CFD and compared with bare slot channel without guiding structure.
