5|$|The {{entirety}} of modern-day NY164 was originally designated as NY312 in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. When the NY312 designation was shifted south to <b>its</b> <b>current</b> {{location in the}} town of Southeast , its former routing in Patterson became part of an extended NY216, which connected with <b>its</b> <b>current</b> routing by way of modern NY311, NY292 and NY55. NY216 was truncated to <b>its</b> <b>current</b> length on January1, 1970. The portion of its former alignment between NY311 and NY22 was then redesignated as NY164.|$|E

5|$|DE 9 was {{extended}} north to US 13 Alt. (now US 13) in Wilmington by 1959, being rerouted off Smyrna-Leipsic Road to follow <b>its</b> <b>current</b> alignment to New Castle, passing through that city on 6th Street before continuing along <b>its</b> <b>current</b> alignment to Wilmington. At this point, the entire route was paved. The current Reedy Point Bridge carrying DE 9 over the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal {{was completed in}} 1968. By 1971, DE 9 {{was extended}} north to <b>its</b> <b>current</b> terminus at DE 2. DE 9 was realigned to bypass New Castle by 1984 by following Washington Street and DE 273.

5|$|DE 9 {{was first}} {{designated}} by 1936 {{to run from}} US 113 (now DE 1) southeast of Dover north to US 13 in Smyrna, following <b>its</b> <b>current</b> alignment to Leipsic and Smyrna-Leipsic Road to Smyrna. In the 1950s, the road was extended to US 13 Alt. (now US 13) in Wilmington, {{in which it was}} rerouted at Leipsic to follow <b>its</b> <b>current</b> alignment to Wilmington. DE 9 was extended further north to DE 2 by the 1970s. The route was rerouted to bypass downtown New Castle in the 1980s. The intersection with DE 1 was reconstructed into an interchange in 2009.|$|E

5|$|In 1946, the {{northern}} terminus {{was moved to}} US 309 in Sellersville, replacing the segment of PA 413. From the late 1940s to before 1960, the southernmost segment on Easton Road from US 309 to Arcadia University was signed as US 611 Alternate. By 1960, the southern terminus was moved to <b>its</b> <b>current</b> location at US 309 (now PA 309) in Cheltenham Township.

5|$|M-34 was {{designated}} and {{signed with the}} beginning of the state highway system around July1, 1919, along a route that extended to either end of <b>its</b> <b>current</b> routing. These western and eastern extensions were added to other highways during the 1920s, shortening M-34 to roughly <b>its</b> <b>current</b> length. A few more changes were made in the mid-1950s and 1960s resulting in the modern routing. M-34 has a short, unsigned sibling, Connector 34, which is better known as Industrial Drive in the Adrian area.|$|E

5|$|M-68 was {{designated}} along {{a segment of}} <b>its</b> <b>current</b> roadway in 1936. The roadway connecting Alanson and Indian River was given the M-68 designation, while US23 was routed between Rogers City and Afton. When US23 was moved to <b>its</b> <b>current</b> lakeshore routing between Rogers City and Cheboygan in 1940, M-33 was extended westerly from Onaway to Afton and north to Cheboygan over the former US23 roadway. The Afton–Onaway segment of M-33 and {{the remainder of the}} former US23 east of Onaway {{was designated}} as a second segment of M-68 as well. The gap between these two segments was eliminated by July 1946.|$|E
5|$|NY12D was {{originally}} assigned {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to most of what is now NY12 between Boonville and Lowville. The alignments of both routes between the two locations were swapped , placing NY12D on <b>its</b> <b>current</b> alignment from Boonville to Potters Corners (in the Town of West Turin) and on NY26 between Potters Corners and Lowville. The overlap between NY12D and NY26 remained in place until the 1970s when NY12D was realigned onto <b>its</b> <b>current</b> routing between Potters Corners and Lyons Falls, replacing then-New York State Route337.|$|E
5|$|On January1, 1949, NY31 was rerouted between Middleport and Medina to use NY31A {{between the}} two locations. NY31A was {{truncated}} to <b>its</b> <b>current</b> western terminus in Medina as a result. It was substantially extended , however, to a new eastern terminus in Brockport. The highway was rerouted east of Millville to follow a series of previously unnumbered roads through Barre and Clarendon to Monroe County, where it supplanted NY31D from the county line eastward. NY31A was truncated slightly to <b>its</b> <b>current</b> eastern terminus in the early 1980s after NY31 was rerouted to bypass Brockport {{to the west and}} south on NY31A and Redman Road.|$|E
