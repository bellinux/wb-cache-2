40|$|One {{of the key}} {{reasons why}} ADLs are yet to be adopted commercially {{on a large scale}} is due to {{shortcomings}} in their ability to describe adequate interface specifications. An interface specification that is vague, lacking in detail, too style focused or too language-specific results in an ADL description with a restricted scope of use. This paper demonstrates how an XML-based ADL (xADL 2. 0) can be extended to model detailed, meaningful interface specifications, and is used as part of a simple prototype to demonstrate how they form an integral part of an architectural description, paying particular attention to interface-level constraints. The approach is based on the principle that an ADL 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>interface</b> modeling features should provide sufficient flexibility to allow them to reflect stakeholder 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>interface</b> concerns at all stages in the lifecycle...|$|R

40|$|Projecte de final de carrera fet en col. laboració amb Technische Universität München. Lehrstuhl für KommunikationsnetzeWithin the {{continuous}} evolution of wireless communications, new and ambitious requirements are {{planned to be}} met by next generation of mobile communications. In order to achieve those requirements, new technologies and mechanisms that work well over broadband frequency, like OFDM and OFDMA, need to be investigated, developed and tested in simulators. New cellular systems designs are based on exploiting instantaneous channel conditions, improving the system performance. Due to this, system level simulations must support a Physical Layer (PHY) abstraction which accurately predicts the instantaneous performance of the link layer. In order to accomplish this, a new link-to-system (L 2 <b>S)</b> <b>interface</b> has been developed and implemented in OpenWNS, a system level simulator for evaluation of OFDM systems developed at RWTH, Aachen. This interface is mainly realized {{through a set of}} mapping mechanisms, used to provide a BLER given a received coded block SINR. Together with the theoretical study and evaluation of these mappings mechanisms, this thesis will analyze and evaluate Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request mechanisms (H-ARQ), and how these protocols can be implemented in system level simulators working together with the L 2 <b>S</b> <b>interface.</b> This thesis shows how the new L 2 <b>S</b> <b>interface</b> is more accurate than past approaches, providing a gain of around 3 dB. Concerning H-ARQ protocols, the results show how the use of these new techniques provides a considerable gain with respect to normal ARQ or not using any such techniqu...|$|R

The dominant species were Chlorobium vibrioforme and Chlorobium limicola (up to 5. 4 X 10 {{to the power of}} 6 cells ml to power of ml minus 1) and minor species were Thiocapsa roseopersicina (< 1. 25 X 10 to the power of 5 cells ml to the power minus 1) and Rhodopseudomonas palustris (< 100 cells ml minus 1). The Chlorobium spp. and T. roseopersicina were found throughout the anoxic water, which ranged in temperature from - 0. 5 C to - 2. 2 C, but did not form discrete layers at the O 2 and H 2 <b>S</b> <b>interface.</b> The growth zone, however, of the Chlorobium spp. was delineated by the presence of light and H 2 S and was restricted to less than 3 m below the O 2 and H 2 <b>S</b> <b>interface.</b> R. palustris was found in oxic and anoxic water. Available light, which varied from 0 to 4. 9 ÂµE m to the power of minus 2 s to the power of minus 1 at the O 2 to H 2 <b>S</b> <b>interface,</b> was considered to be the major environmental factor controlling growth of the bacterial phototrophs. Growth was initiated in spring in low light levels (< 1 ÂµE m to the power of minus 2 s to the power of minus 1) following 3 months of darkness during winter. It is concluded that the dominance of the Chlorobium spp. was a result of their more efficient maintenance metabolism in winter and of their greater efficiency in utilizing low intensity light...|$|R
40|$|Pratt & Whitney has {{developed}} a Broadband Fan Noise Prediction System (BFaNS) for turbofan engines. This system computes the noise generated by turbulence impinging on the leading edges of the fan and fan exit guide vane, and noise generated by boundary-layer turbulence passing over the fan trailing edge. BFaNS has been validated on three fan rigs that were tested during the NASA Advanced Subsonic Technology Program (AST). The predicted noise spectra agreed well with measured data. The predicted effects of fan speed, vane count, and vane sweep also agreed well with measurements. The noise prediction system consists of two computer programs: Setup_BFaNS and BFaNS. Setup_BFaNS converts user-specified geometry and flow-field information into a BFaNS input file. From this input file, BFaNS computes the inlet and aft broadband sound power spectra generated by the fan and FEGV. The output file from BFaNS contains the inlet, aft and total sound power spectra from each noise source.
