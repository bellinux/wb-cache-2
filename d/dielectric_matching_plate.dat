The design is comprised of two gangbuster whole-surfaces separated by a distance, d, that is comparable to {{a fraction of a}} wavelength in S-band, and enhanced by the addition of a <b>dielectric</b> <b>matching</b> <b>plate.</b> The gangbuster array is comprised of tightly packed straight skewed dipole elements referred to as half-surfaces. Two of these half-surfaces are oriented orthogonal to each other and placed an array separation distance, s, apart to form the gangbuster whole-surface which allows any arbitrary plane of incidence. Results are given for the triple-band design with and without dielectric and conduction losses. The cross polarization properties of the dichroic surface was further investigated. It is shown that the reflection cross polarized component is dominated by the geometry of the front whole surface of the design (particularly the array separation s) and is never more than - 22. 5 dB in the frequency band 0 to 30 GHz. The transmission cross polarization component is dependent on both whole-surfaces and is never more than - 30 dB in the same frequency band...|$|E

40|$|A {{prototype}} {{system for}} passive intracranial monitoring using microwave radiometry is proposed. It comprises an ellipsoidal conductive wall cavity to achieve beamforming and focusing, {{in conjunction with}} sensitive multiband receivers for detection. The system has already shown the capability to provide temperature and/or conductivity variations in phantoms and biological tissue. In this article, {{a variant of the}} initially constructed modality is theoretically and experimentally investigated. Specifically, <b>dielectric</b> <b>matching</b> materials are used in an effort to improve the system's focusing attributes. The theoretical study investigates the effect of <b>dielectric</b> <b>matching</b> materials on the system's detection depth, whereas measurements with phantoms focus on the investigation of the system's detection level and spatial resolution. The combined results suggest that the <b>dielectric</b> <b>matching</b> layers lead to the improvement of the system's detection depth and temperature detection level. Also, the system's spatial resolution is explored at various experimental setups. Theoretical and experimental results conclude that with the appropriate combination of operation frequencies and dielectric layers, it is possible to monitor areas of interest inside human head models with a variety of detection depths and spatial resolutions.

On one hand, it is examined whether the system is capable of sensing real-time progressive local variations of temperature and/or conductivity in customized phantom setups; on the other hand, the focusing attributes of the system are explored for different positions and types of phantoms used for hyperthermia in conjunction with <b>dielectric</b> <b>matching</b> layers surrounding the areas of interest.

40|$|In this paper, a 50 Ω {{terminated}} or {{in other}} words transformerless bandpass matching network design methodology and an implementation example are presented. The real frequency techniques are powerful numerical methods to design wideband lossless two-port networks such as filters, matching networks and amplifiers. In these techniques, {{the value of the}} termination resistance of the designed network could not be yielded as 50 Ω by numerical package. Hence, a transformer is also required for 50 Ω termination which is not practical for high frequency applications. By employing the proposed procedure, it is guaranteed to obtain transformerless bandpass matching network. Also in this study a wideband suspended monopole antenna is examined. The proposed antenna consists of two major elements; Y-shaped impedance <b>matching</b> <b>plate</b> and hemi-circular radiator. Moreover Y-shaped impedance <b>matching</b> <b>plate</b> connected to a feeding probe excites the suspended hemi-circular radiator via air gap. Consequently, a transformerless bandpass matching network is designed to filter and expand the operational frequency bandwidth of the proposed antenna.

Overall, {{suppressing the}} {{tangential}} E-field results in low-loss propagation of SPs, {{and this is}} enabled by employing a thin metal core with symmetric dielectric cladding. Unlike the metamaterial-core case, this thin-metal core structure {{does not require the}} condition of good dielectric-matching between core and cladding. Propagation length and penetration depth of a thin-metal core case are a strong function of metal thickness at <[*] 50  nm range, but are less dependent on cladding dielectric constant (Fig.  9 a, b). By contrast, in the metamaterial core case, the opposite characteristics (i.e., sensitive to <b>dielectric</b> <b>matching</b> and less sensitive to core layer thickness) are observed, and significantly longer propagation lengths and penetration depths are attainable: e.g., 100 – 200  mm propagation length and 10 – 15  µm penetration depth at 120 – 150  nm core layer thickness with ∆ɛ of 0.238 (see Fig.  7 b, c). In terms of practicality of implementing the designed structure with good reproducibility (i.e., less prone to process fluctuation such as thickness variation), the metamaterial core structure with a small number of layers offers an advantage over the thin-metal core case.|$|R

The experimental results of microporous membrane filtration indicated that the hydrodynamic characteristic size of polymer maintained a good nonlinear relationship with polymer viscosity; the value increased as the molecular weight and concentration of the polymer increased and increased as the salinity of dilution water decreased. Additionally, the hydrodynamic characteristic size decreased as the pressure increased, so the hydrodynamic characteristic size ought to be determined based on the pressure of the target block. In the core flow studies, good matching of polymer and formation was identified as polymer flow pressure gradient lower than the fracture pressure gradient of formation. In this case, good matching that was the pore throat radius should be larger than 10 times the hydrodynamic characteristic size of polymer in this study. Using relationship, more matching relationship between the hydrodynamic characteristic sizes of polymer solutions and the pore throat radius of target block was determined...|$|R

The non-uniform optical near-field distribution of MMDG {{is an important factor}} that limits damage resistant capabilities. MMDG for pulse compressors operating at 800 nm with a corrugated SiO 2 layer are designed by using a genetic algorithm and the Fourier mode method. The diffraction efficiency, bandwidth, and near-field distribution of the MMDG are theoretically investigated. For the single <b>dielectric</b> <b>match</b> layer grating, the bandwidth is 140 nm, if the thickness and refractive index of the match layer are changed, the maximum electric field in the grating ridge, match layer, and metal layer of the grating increases with the decrease in grating diffraction efficiency. For the multi-dielectric match layer grating, the bandwidth and the maximum electric field in the metal layer decrease with the increase in high- and low-index material pairs, and the maximum electric field in the grating ridge and match layer initially decreases and then increases. Over a wide wavelength range, the maximum electric field in the grating ridge, match layer, and metal layer is minimal near the central wavelength. Moreover, MMDG should be used at larger incident angles while keeping enough bandwidth to reduce the electric field in the grating...|$|R

For the first case, the optic axes of the oppositely facing anisotropic layers of the two interacting slabs generally possess an angular mismatch, and within each multilayered slab the optic axes may either be the same, or undergo constant angular increments across the anisotropic layers. In particular, we examine how the behaviors of the van der Waals torque and force can be "tuned" by adjusting the layer thicknesses, the relative angular increment within each slab, and the angular mismatch between the slabs.
