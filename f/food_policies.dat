With the surrender of Italy in September 1943, Montenegrin Chetnik commander Pavle Đurišić established ties with Ljotić.

5|$|Farm incomes {{have fallen}} {{over the years}} as a result of cheap <b>food</b> <b>policies</b> in the United Kingdom, the {{lowering}} of world commodity prices and the removal of production-based subsidies. Particularly hard hit have been the incomes of hill farms in Wales which averaged £15,000 in 2014, as against £23,000 for lowland livestock farms and £59,000 for dairy farms. The labour force has been dwindling for many years as a result of increased mechanisation and changes in farming practices. Fewer farmers are needed today because they are able to produce more food from their land. Hay is no longer the main source of winter feed for livestock and has largely been replaced by silage, particularly baled silage wrapped in film that can be handled mechanically. This has reduced the manpower needed on farms, and there has been an increase of use by farmers of specialised contractors who provide services in silage making, harvesting and fencing. Another problem facing Welsh farmers is their distance from the main distribution centres used by supermarkets which are mostly located near centres of population in England.|$|E

40|$|Food {{security}} is increasingly gaining {{the attention of}} researchers and policy makers around the globe, given the expected world population of nine billion by 2050. Effective development and implementation mechanisms of <b>food</b> <b>policy</b> are required for elimination and prevention of food insecurity in developing countries. This chapter aims to give an overview of <b>food</b> <b>policy</b> capacity in Mongolia, and consists of a brief discussion of the trends in agricultural production, an overview of <b>policies</b> related to <b>food</b> security, {{and the results of}} a study among major institutions involved in <b>food</b> <b>policy</b> development and implementation. The study revealed an imbalanced priority setting in the <b>food</b> <b>policy</b> of the Mongolian government and recommends shifting the target from export-oriented production increases in the crop sector to food security among the rural poor, which consists of pastoral herders in the majority. Further, the study confirmed substantial shortcomings in <b>food</b> <b>policy</b> research capacity due to the inadequate recognition of <b>food</b> <b>policy</b> research as an essential component of policy making. This is attributed to the lack of funds for <b>food</b> <b>policy</b> research. The current perception is that <b>food</b> <b>policy</b> research is embedded in common fields of economic or agricultural research rather than an independent field of research in itself. The chapter concludes that, without a perception change on the importance of policy research as an independent field of study, any attempts to improve <b>food</b> <b>policy</b> research capacity might fail. This is due to the risk of losing focus, as other concepts that policymakers are more familiar with will get their attention and, hence, the allocation of funds. Therefore, the most effective approach of improving <b>food</b> <b>policy</b> research in Mongolia might be to establish a new institution that introduces the concept and demonstrates that <b>food</b> <b>policy</b> research {{is as important as the}} other areas of food and agricultural research, thus worth funding by the government...|$|R

40|$|Background: Schools {{can play}} an {{important}} role in the prevention of obesity, e. g. by providing an environment that stimulates healthy eating habits and by developing a <b>food</b> <b>policy</b> to provide such an environment. The effectiveness of a school <b>food</b> <b>policy</b> is affected by the content of the policy, its implementation and its support by parents, teachers and principals. The aim of this study is to detect opportunities to improve the school <b>food</b> <b>policy</b> and/or implementation at Dutch primary schools. Therefore, this study explores the school <b>food</b> <b>policy</b> and investigates schools' (teachers and principals) and parents' opinion on the school <b>food</b> <b>policy.</b> Methods. Data on the schools' perspective of the <b>food</b> <b>policy</b> was collected from principals and teachers by means of semi-structured interviews. In total 74 principals and 72 teachers from 83 Dutch primary schools were interviewed. Data on parental perceptions about the school <b>food</b> <b>policy</b> were based on a cross-sectional survey among 1, 429 parents from the same schools. Results: Most principals (87. 1 %) reported that their school had a written food policy; however in most cases the rules were not clearly defined. Most of the principals (87. 8 %) believed that their school paid sufficient attention to nutrition and health. Teachers and principals felt that parents were primarily responsible to encourage healthy eating habits among children, while 49. 8 % of the parents believed that it is also a responsibility of the school to foster healthy eating habits among children. Most parents reported that they appreciated the school <b>food</b> <b>policy</b> and comply with the food rules. Parents' opinion on the enforcement of the school <b>food</b> <b>policy</b> varied: 28. 1 % believed that the school should enforce the policy more strongly, 32. 1 % was satisfied, and 39. 8 % had no opinion on this topic. Conclusion: Dutch primary schools could play a more important role in fostering healthy eating habits among children. The school <b>food</b> <b>policy</b> could be improved by clearly formulating food rules, simplifying supervision of the food rules, and defining how to enforce the food rules. In addition, the school <b>food</b> <b>policy</b> will only influence children's dietary behaviour if both the school and the parents support the policy...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{understand}} how ideas about markets and marketing have shaped <b>food</b> <b>policy.</b> It focuses on the vegetable sector in England in the early years of the new millennium. The study takes the 2002 Report of the Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food (Curry Commission) as its starting point. It explores how the Curry Commission’s ‘Turn to the Market’ call was interpreted and acted upon by vegetable production in England, and by UK Government (in practice English) <b>Food</b> <b>Policy</b> 2002 - 2015. It attempts to understand why and how policy makers turned to the market, what they meant by it, and how it changed how those involved in vegetable production thought about and responded to the marketing challenges they faced. The study centres on theoretical understandings of how <b>food</b> <b>policy</b> develops, and draws in marketing theories to contribute to that policy analysis. The study used qualitative methods - a combination of documentary analysis and fieldwork interviews with practitioners, policy-makers and analysts. Two research questions were formulated from the literature review: (1) how have ideas about markets and marketing shaped UK <b>Food</b> <b>Policy</b> since the Curry Commission?; and (2) what impact did the Curry Commission - and the policy that followed - have on English vegetable production? An analysis was conducted of policy documents of the period 2002 – 2015. Interviews were held with 23 key informants who were experts on and/or actors in English policy and vegetable production. The research adopted a realist and critical pluralist approach to <b>food</b> <b>policy</b> development. The research explored: how particular ideas of markets and marketing shaped wider UK <b>Food</b> <b>Policy</b> 2002 - 2015; how the marketing themes in UK <b>Food</b> <b>Policy</b> evolved; how UK <b>Food</b> <b>Policy</b> understood and framed the priorities for the vegetable sector which then opened up particular solutions and foreclosed others; and how the marketing ideas in UK <b>Food</b> <b>Policy</b> 2002 - 2015 affected how those involved in English vegetable production understood and responded to the marketing challenges they encountered. The findings show that UK <b>Food</b> <b>Policy</b> evolved from a proactive ‘Turn to the Market’ <b>Food</b> <b>Policy</b> under New Labour to a reactive 'Market Dominated' <b>Food</b> <b>Policy</b> under the Coalition government (2010 - 15). Policy framed the problems for the vegetable sector as a failure to market and devised policy mechanisms to support better marketing using ideas from orthodox marketing. The policy based on better marketing did halt the decline in the vegetable sector and helped it engage in more environmentally benign production practices. Growers still found it challenging to generate sufficient profit to reinvest and they felt that support for better marketing did not always work in practice. The thesis concludes that the marketing concepts do enrich <b>food</b> <b>policy</b> understanding. A markets-as-networks (MAN) analysis is proposed to provide a better way of understanding the marketing problems in the context of buyer dominated vegetable supply networks, where interaction is an important feature of supply relations and where exchange is embedded in on-going relationships. The research discussion considers the extent to which markets-as-networks (MAN) ideas offer a better framework for policy goals to increase the production of vegetables in England as part of a sustainable model for agriculture. Relationship marketing, from orthodox marketing, displays some features in common with the MAN tradition. By proposing this common ground between orthodox and heterodox marketing, the thesis offers directions for a revitalised market-oriented understanding of UK <b>Food</b> <b>Policy</b> and its development.
