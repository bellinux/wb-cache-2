Southgate named a {{slightly}} weakened side for the game; live on BBC's Match of the Day - Adam Johnson, Lee Dong-Gook and Lee Cattermole earning starting places, with Stewart Downing, George Boateng and a returning Mido on the bench.

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} Marx {{topology}} DC-DC boost converter (MTBC) with a <b>high</b> <b>boot</b> ratio, where a parallel connection is applied on the input side {{in order to}} reduce the conduction and copper losses while a series connection is applied on the output side {{in order to reduce}} the voltage stress on switching devices. With the proposed circuit configuration, the high boost ratio DC-DC converter achieves high efficiency. A three-stage MTBC with a boost ratio of 8. 33 between the input and output voltages was designed and constructed. A maximum efficiency of 94. 5 % was achieved with the designated three-stage MTBC. The loss analysis showed that the iron and conduction losses were dominant. The volume analysis showed that the proposed three-stage MTBC requires approximately 23 % less of a total volume compared to the conventional isolated DC-DC converter with a two-series-output-rectifier (ICSR) while reducing the power loss...|$|E

In JT- 60, as a result of ferritic steel tiles (FSTs) installation to reduce the troidal field ripple and the application of the real time current profile control, <b>high</b> <b>boot</b> strap current fraction (~ 0. 7) has successfully been sustained about 8 s. In addition, the conceptual design of JT- 60 SA, which was placed as a combined project of JA-EU Satellite Tokamak Programme under the Broader Approach Programme and JAEA's programme for national use, was progressed. In theoretical and analytical researches, studies on ITB events and their triggers, plasma shape effect on edge stability and driven magnetic island evolution in rotating plasmas were progressed. In the NEXT project, computer simulations of the plasma turbulence were progressed. In fusion reactor technologies, R&Ds for ITER and fusion DEMO plants have been carried out. For ITER, a steady state operation of the 170 GHz gyrotoron up to 10 min with 0. 82 MW was demonstrated. Also current density of the neutral beam injector has been extended to 146 A/m 2 at 0. 84 MeV. In the ITER Test Blanket Module (TBM), designs and R&Ds of Water and Helium Cooled Solid Breeder TBMs including tritium breeder/multiplier materials were progressed. Tritium processing technology for breeding blankets and neutronics integral experiments with a blanket mockup were also progressed. For ITER and DEMO blankets, studies on neutron irradiation effects and ion irradiation effects on F 82 H steel characteristics were continue...|$|E

The aim of this thesis is to investigate whether a hypervisor could theoretically exploit the overlap in the instruction streams of concurrently booting VMs to reduce CPU pressure in boot storms. This idea, which we name silhouette execution, would allow hypervisors to use the CPU in a scalable way, much like transparent page sharing allows a hypervisor to use its limited memory in a scalable fashion. To evaluate silhouette execution, we studied user-space instruction streams from a few Linux services using dynamic instrumentation. We statistically profiled the extent of nondeterminism in program execution, and compiled the reasons behind any execution differences. Though there is significant overlap in the user-mode instruction streams of Linux services, our simple simulations show that silhouette execution would increase CPU pressure by 13 % for 100 VMs and 6 % for 1000 VMs. To remedy this, we present a few strategies for reducing synthetic differences in execution in user-space programs. Our simulations show that silhouette execution can reduce CPU pressure on a host by a factor of 8 x for 100 VMs and a factor of 19 x for 1000 VMs once these strategies are used. We believe that the insights provided in this thesis on controlling execution differences in concurrently booting VMs via dynamic instrumentation are a prelude to a successful future implementation of silhouette execution. by Syed Aunn Hasan Raza.
