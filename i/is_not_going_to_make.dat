5|$|On October 10, 2011the {{day before}} Chandler's 65th birthdayFlorida Governor Rick Scott signed Chandler's death warrant. His {{execution}} {{was set for}} November 15, 2011, at 4:00pm. His lawyer, Baya Harrison, said that Chandler asked him not to file any frivolous appeals to keep him alive. Harrison said: He is not {{putting a lot of}} pressure on me to go running around at the end to find some magic way out. He <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a scene. He's not going to bemoan the legal system. What he has told me is this: if there is some legal way that I can find to try to prevent him from being executed, he would like me to do what I reasonably can. Harrison also said that Chandler suffered from high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, problems with his kidneys and arthritis.|$|E
2500|$|Hansis and Silbermann cited their offscreen {{friendship}} as {{the reason}} for their ease when portraying intimate scenes between Luke and Noah. [...] "It makes them easier.

[...] "I think we work well together and I couldn't have asked for a cooler person to play opposite. Jake is just very down to earth and funny and open to different ideas. It makes every scene very comfortable." [...] Silbermann added, [...] "I think we had become friends before the first kiss... If anything, I think it makes it more comfortable." ...|$|E

I want to tell you, Roland,"--and she hesitated. [...] "I don't know whether people talk about such things, but I am sure you won't mind.

Not only is Minette--I told you her name before--nothing to me, but I dislike her as a passionate, {{dangerous}} young woman; capable, perhaps, of good, but certainly capable of evil. However, I regret to say that Arnold Dampierre, the man who was in the next bed to me, you know, does not see her in the same light, and I am very much afraid he will be fool enough to marry her. Actually, she did a few days later obtain permission to see him, and has, I believe, seen him several times since; but as he was moved out of your ward whilst I was battling with the fever, I have not seen her. Now don't cry, child, you have been a goose, but there is no harm done, and you ought to be glad to know that your old friend <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a fool of himself; and he can still be regarded by you as truthful and honorable. Do you think I would have taken you round to my rooms if I had been going to make her their mistress?" ...|$|E

From that moment, Daisy leads a double life full of risks, where she must attend a human school, hiding her nature, and also go to vampire school and take classes for newly bitten vampires.|$|E

50|$|It appears Mantle <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it; {{his health}} deteriorates and he plays in {{constant}} pain. Maris, meanwhile, is unaccustomed {{to such a}} high level of public scrutiny and is uncomfortable interacting with the media, who dissect and distort everything he says or does. The fans heckle Maris and even throw objects at him on the field. Soon he begins receiving hate mail and death threats. His wife lives far from New York, usually available only by phone. The stress becomes so intense that Maris' hair begins to fall out in clumps. The Yankees owner also tries to favor Mantle by asking Houk to switch Mantle and Maris in the batting order, but Houk refuses, because the redesigned lineup has been winning a higher percentage of games.|$|E
50|$|At {{the last}} day of the college party, Rajiv apologizes to Mambo with a thought that Mambo was {{planning}} to propose to Payal. He then realizes his mistake as Payal still loves him. Rajiv takes the mike and publicly apologizes to Payal. He tells her he loves her a lot, even though she might not believe him. Payal is still angry with him and tells him that despite doing a drama in front of everyone and proclaiming his love <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> her relent. Rajiv stands before her and gazes pleadingly into her eyes. Payal is convinced that Rajiv does love her and embraces him. Alisha hugs Rajeev but only to wish the couple well. The movie ends with a happy Rajiv and Payal - and Alisha coming over to wish Rajiv all the best for his life.|$|E

5000|$|Improved {{availability}} {{to quality}} education, including skills training for adults, {{is a solution}} that in principle at least is not opposed by any side of the political spectrum, and welcomed even {{by those who are}} optimistic about long-term technological employment. Improved education paid for by government tends to be especially popular with industry. However, several academics have argued that improved education alone will not be sufficient to solve technological unemployment, pointing to recent declines in the demand for many intermediate skills, and suggesting that not everyone is capable in becoming proficient in the most advanced skills. [...] Kim Taipale has said that [...] "The era of bell curve distributions that supported a bulging social middle class is over... Education per se <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> up the difference." [...] while back in 2011 Paul Krugman argued that better education would be an insufficient solution to technological unemployment.|$|E
50|$|In combat, each soldier carries one field {{dressing}} {{ready for}} immediate use. Standard doctrine {{is that a}} casualty's dressing should be used rather than the rescuer's - the rescuer may need to help another casualty, or be helped himself, whereas the original casualty <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> any other use of his own dressing. Because of this, {{it is important that}} soldiers know where to find their comrades' field dressings, and infantry units typically have their own SOP stating where they should be carried. British Army uniforms issued in the past included dedicated field dressing pockets. During the Great War, this pocket was in the front left skirt of the tunic, with the introduction of Battledress (1937), it was moved to the trousers, but the current clothing does not. Instead, a common location for field dressings is the left shoulder-strap of the webbing, either held in place with gaffer tape or contained in a small pouch that is not issued but can be purchased from several civilian suppliers.|$|E

5000|$|After the UFC {{had tried}} to sign Nam and been {{made aware of the}} {{contract}} clause, UFC president, Dana White stated: [...] "When you made the decision to cut him, you cut him. That's one of the dirtiest things you can do in the fight business. Nam <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> or break the UFC. But the problem is, the dirty scumbag moves that these guys are pulling hurts the fighter." [...] Bellator CEO, Bjorn Rebney, later defended his contractual clauses, saying [...] "The essence of them is that you're not asking to restrict a fighter's ability to fight. You're not looking to hold somebody back from participating. All you're asking for is, look, if we give you an incredible opportunity to fight our champion in a non-title fight, or we give you a great opportunity to be on TV, we at least want what most promoters believe is fair - the ability just to match another offer. Not to give you less, but to give you what somebody else is offering, and they're in every single agreement we have, and I think they're probably in every single agreement the UFC has, as well." ...|$|E
5000|$|Arriving upstairs, Danny is {{also taken}} hostage, while {{recognizing}} his long estranged brother Paul {{as one of}} the robbers. AJ and Ally take the hostages to a back room and keep guard, however during a momentary lack of concentration from the robbers, Danny is able to text 911 and summon Detective Pascal (Victoria Pratt) to the scene, along with a few rookie cops. Pascal questions Paul at the front door who convinces her the text was not sent from the bank, however Pascal remains suspicious and quickly takes a photo of him to send to her station for identification. While leaving, Pascal finds Rick snorting cocaine in the van, prompting Rick to try and escape into the bank. Realizing he <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it, he pulls his gun, only for Pascal to shoot him twice in the chest, severely injuring him. Paul, Washington and Biggs open fire on the officers and manage to drag the injured Rick inside of the bank. Shortly afterwards a number of patrol cars show up, including Pascal's boss Franklin (Robert Craighead). Meanwhile, Tracey goes into the vault to collect the money and look for the missing civilian, Bernard. After not being able to find him, Tracey gathers money and items of value in a large bag. As she is about to return to the group, Bernard attacks her, stabbing her multiple times and gouging out her eyes.|$|E
50|$|Competitive play may {{be either}} singles, or doubles. In singles, two players face off against each other. In doubles, two teams of two players fight each other. Sharing stocks with your {{teammate}} is allowed. Friendly fire is enabled, so teammates can damage or save each other. This {{is to ensure}} fairness, as certain combinations of characters in teams can prove to be overpowered. It also ensures that two-on-one situations aren't overwhelmingly tilted in the winning team's favor. It also adds a couple of extra strategies. For example, some characters can absorb attacks, to heal themselves or to charge an attack for later use. With friendly fire on, a player can attack their ally specifically {{to allow them to}} absorb it. Additionally, most characters have a triple jump that, once used, prevents the character from taking any action until they are hit with an attack, land back on the stage, are KO'd. If a player <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it back to the stage, their ally can hit them with a weak attack, allowing them to re-use their triple jump and make it back. A similar thing applies to Jigglypuff's Rest move, which is extremely powerful, but immobilizes Jigglypuff for several seconds, unless she is hit by an attack. An ally can use his or her weakest move to knock Jigglypuff out of this state, denying the enemy the chance to use a powerful move on her. Super Smash Bros. for Wii U adds an eight player mode, which allows triples and quadruples teams, although there have been comparatively few tournaments.|$|E
