2500|$|Tannins {{are found}} in the skin, stems, and seeds of wine grapes but can also be {{introduced}} to the wine through the use of oak barrels and chips or with the addition of tannin powder. The natural tannins found in grapes are known as proanthocyanidins due to their ability to release red anthocyanin pigments when they are heated in an acidic solution. Grape extracts are mainly rich in monomers and small oligomers (mean degree of polymerization <8). Grape seed extracts contain three monomers (catechin, epicatechin and epicatechin gallate) and procyanidin oligomers. Grape skin extracts contain four monomers (catechin, epicatechin, <b>gallocatechin</b> and epigallocatechin), as well as procyanidins and prodelphinidins oligomers. The tannins are formed by enzymes during metabolic processes of the grapevine. The amount of tannins found naturally in grapes varies depending on the variety with Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo, Syrah and Tannat being 4 of the most tannic grape varieties. The reaction of tannins and anthocyanins with the phenolic compound catechins creates another class of tannins known as pigmented tannins which influence the color of red wine. Commercial preparations of tannins, known as enological tannins, made from oak wood, grape seed and skin, plant gall, chestnut, quebracho, gambier and myrobalan fruits, can be added at different stages of the wine production to improve color durability. The tannins derived from oak influence are known as [...] "hydrolysable tannins" [...] being created from the ellagic and gallic acid found in the wood.|$|E

40|$|The antistaphylococcal {{activity}} {{as well as}} the metabolic profiling and polyphenols content of green tea (Camellia sinensis) before and after in vitro simulated gastric, duodenal and gastroduodenal digestion were investigated. Gastric and duodenal digested samples showed antistaphylococcal activity, whereas gastroduodenal digested samples did not show any antibacterial activity. Metabolite analysis, carried out using an explorative untargeted NMR-based approach and a RP-HPLC-PAD-ESI-MSn method, showed that green tea polyphenols are stable under gastric conditions. Duodenal digested sample maintained the antibacterial activity, even if some polyphenols are widely degraded. Epicatechin 3 -gallate, under duodenal digestive conditions, is hydrolyzed to produce epicatechin, whereas epigallocatechin 3 -gallate reacts with digestive enzymes and a galloyl-high molecular weight derivative is produced. Gastroduodenal digestion results in degradation of polyphenols, especially <b>gallocatechins,</b> considered the main responsible for the antibacterial activity.

The tannins derived from oak influence are known as [...] "hydrolysable tannins" [...] being created from the ellagic and gallic acid found in the wood.In the vineyards, there is also a growing distinction being made between [...] "ripe" [...] and [...] "unripe" [...] tannins present in the grape. This [...] "physiological ripeness", which is roughly determined by tasting the grapes off the vines, is being used along with sugar levels as a determination of when to harvest. The idea is that [...] "riper" [...] tannins will taste softer but still impart some of the texture components found favorable in wine. In winemaking, the amount of the time that the must spends in contact with the grape skins, stems and seeds will influence the amount of tannins that are present in the wine with wines subjected to longer maceration period having more tannin extract. Following harvest, stems are normally picked out and discarded prior to fermentation but some winemakers may intentionally leave in a few stems for varieties low in tannins (like Pinot noir) in order to increase the tannic extract in the wine. If there is an excess in the amount of tannins in the wine, winemakers can use various fining agents like albumin, casein and gelatin that can bind to tannins molecule and precipitate them out as sediments. As a wine ages, tannins will form long polymerized chains which come across to a taster as [...] "softer" [...] and less tannic. This process can be accelerated by exposing the wine to oxygen, which oxidize tannins to quinone-like compounds that are polymerization-prone. The winemaking technique of micro-oxygenation and decanting wine use oxygen to partially mimic the effect of aging on tannins.|$|E

The data obtained indicated that although [~] 40 % of flavan- 3 -ol intake is recovered in ileal fluid, substantial quantities are absorbed in the small intestine.

Bark powder was defatted with hexane and crude extract (CE) was obtained by extraction with aqueous acetone (70 %). A liquid partition with ethyl acetate was performed to produce an organic extract (OE), which was subsequently purified by column chromatography (Toyopearl HW- 40 F, methanol), and resulted in six methanolic fractions (MF 1 to MF 6) and an oligomeric fraction (OLF) eluted with acetone 67 %. Extraction yields, total phenolic and flavanol contents were determined. The antioxidant activity of bark extracts was measured by 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), Trolox (6 -hydroxy- 2, 5, 7, 8 -tetramethyl-chroman- 2 -carboxylic-acid) -equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), and ferric ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. Their median effective concentration (EC₅₀) data and rate constants for DPPH radical scavenging were also estimated. Identification of major phenolics was carried out by high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) and high performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization coupled to mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) instruments. Bioactive gallic acid, catechin, epicatechin, <b>gallocatechin,</b> catechin gallate, dimeric procyanidins, galloylated dimeric proanthocyanidins, trimeric procyanidins, and tetrameric proanthocyanidins were detected and identified in Q. sideroxyla bark extracts. MF 2 was the most active fraction containing <b>gallocatechin</b> as its major compound; MF 5 and OLF contain galloylated procyanidins, which may explain their higher antiradical activity. OLF besides galloylated procyanidins has <b>gallocatechin,</b> which presumably contributes to its higher antiradical activity. Consequently, Q. sideroxyla bark could be a good source of therapeutic health products or nutraceutical ingredients that may exert a potential prevention or treatment action against diseases in biological systems...|$|E
