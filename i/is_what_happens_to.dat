500|$|A {{few days}} later the Emperor awarded Caxias the Order of PedroI and raised him from marquis to duke, the highest rank of Brazilian nobility, and a unique {{distinction}} during PedroII's 58-year reign. The Emperor also appointed him to the Council of State on October 1870. But none of this prevented Caxias from attacks and accusations—some petty—in the parliament, including having left his post without permission. The embittered duke wrote to his friend Manuel Luís Osório, Marquis of Erval: [...] "When I was young, my friend, I {{did not know how}} to explain why the elderly were selfish, but now that I am old, I see that they are like that because of the disappointments and ingratitudes they suffer during their lives. At least this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> me".|$|E
500|$|Rhimes {{entitled}} the episode [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] {{because she felt}} [...] "that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> each intern in this episode. Each intern lets go of the things they've held onto all season. George lets go of loving Meredith. Cristina lets go of her well-checked emotions. Izzie is forced {{to let go of}} her idealism. And that leads to her letting go of medicine. Alex lets go of his rage against Izzie. And Meredith... well, Meredith just lets go." [...] The costumes were designed by Mimi Melgaard; Rhimes noted that everyone was dressed in dark funeral colors to the prom, except Stevens who was dressed in pink. Stevens' dress was an Amsale creation. Monologues done by the five main characters were used in this episode. Rhimes commented: [...] "this was something we'd never done and I wasn't sure would work. But you place those pages {{into the hands of the}} actors and each and every one of them layered their characters' souls right into the dialogue." [...] The episode's theme was the prom; Rhimes said she wanted to do it since the beginning of the season.|$|E
500|$|Spence D. of IGN Music praised [...] "Ave Maria", {{writing that}} it shows Knowles in [...] "crystal clear form" [...] {{due to the}} mellow accompaniment that {{highlighted}} her [...] "often captivating" [...] voice. Darryl Sterdan, writing for the Canadian website Jam!, noted that Knowles [...] "draws on the classic composition for this sweeping number" [...] and echoes a similar line to John Lennon's quote: [...] "Life <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> you while you're busy making other plans." [...] Talia Kraines of BBC Online called the song [...] "very strange, but wonderful". In his consumer guide, Robert Christgau wrote, [...] "But me, I'm a hater, and thus I'm something like outraged, by not just those two pimp-outs but an 'Ave Maria' lacking even the dumbstruck literalism of Pink's rendition or the grotesque conversion of 'Umbrella' into 'Halo.'" [...] Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald wrote that the song was [...] "pompous and frankly embarrassing". Colin McGuire of PopMatters commented that [...] "Ave Maria" [...] is a [...] "pretty normal take, a piece that has simply been done too many times before to think [...] would even {{have a shot at}} putting her stamp on it." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian described the song as [...] "dreary". According to James Reed of The Boston Globe, the song is [...] "an intriguing proposition torpedoed by a soggy arrangement". Adam Mazmanian of The Washington Times gave a negative review for the song, writing that the high notes included [...] on [...] "Ave Maria", [...] "should have remained a secret between Beyonce and her producers". In 2013, John Boone and Jennifer Cady of E! Online placed the song at number ten on their list of ten best Knowles' songs. They further added, [...] "The new classic kicks off with the plucking off some light strings and you know by the end you'll be singing through tears." ...|$|E

2500|$|Outside of the {{transsexual}} {{community and}} sexology researchers, this controversy is largely notable {{because of its}} implications for academic freedom and freedom of speech. [...] In an interview with The New York Times, Dreger said, [...] "If we're going to have research at all, then we're going to have people saying unpopular things, and if this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> them, then we've got problems not only for science but free expression itself."

2500|$|The book {{elicited}} both strongly {{supportive and}} strongly negative reactions. The controversial aspects included {{the contents of}} the book, whether the research was conducted ethically, whether it should have been published by the National Academies Press, and whether it should have been promoted as a scientific work. According to Benedict Carey's story in The New York Times, [...] "To many of Dr. Bailey’s peers, his story is a morality play about the corrosive effects of political correctness on academic freedom." [...] Interviewed by Carey, bioethicist Alice Dreger argues that [...] "what happened to Bailey is important, because the harassment was so extraordinarily bad and because it could happen to any researcher in the field. If we’re going to have research at all, then we’re going to have people saying unpopular things, and if this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> them, then we’ve got problems not only for science but free expression itself." ...|$|E

And {{when he came to}} the religious aspect he said that there were more stone and brick churches used in France; but, on the other hand, there are more sects in England. Whether such a lively disintegration is a proof of vitality in any valuable sense I have always doubted. The sun may breed maggots in a dead dog; but it is essential for such a liberation of life that the dog should be unconscious or (to say the least of it) absent-minded.

6000|$|And now I hear {{cries of}} protest arising all round. First my own schoolmasters, or their ghosts, asking whether I was cruelly beaten at school? No; but then I {{did not learn}} {{anything}} at school. Dr Johnson's schoolmaster presumably did care enough whether Sam learned anything to beat him savagely enough {{to force him to}} lame his mind--for Johnson's great mind was lamed--by learning his lessons. None of my schoolmasters really cared a rap (or perhaps it would be fairer to them to say that their employers did not care a rap and therefore did not give them the necessary caning powers) whether I learnt my lessons or not, provided my father paid my schooling bill, the collection of which was the real object of the school. Consequently I did not learn my school lessons, having much more important ones in hand, with the result that I have not wasted my life trifling with literary fools in taverns as Johnson did when he should have been shaking England with the thunder of his spirit. My schooling did me a great deal of harm and no good whatever: it was simply dragging a child's soul through the dirt; but I escaped Squeers and Creakle just as I escaped Johnson and Carlyle. And this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> most of us. We are not effectively coerced to learn: we stave off punishment {{as far as we can}} by lying and trickery and guessing and using our wits; and when this does not suffice we scribble impositions, or suffer extra imprisonments--"keeping in" [...] was the phrase in my time--or let a master strike us with a cane and fall back on our pride at being able to hear it physically (he not being allowed to hit us too hard) to outface the dishonor we should have been taught to die rather than endure. And so idleness and worthlessness on the one hand and a pretence of coercion on the other became a despicable routine. If my schoolmasters had been really engaged in educating me instead of painfully earning their bread by keeping me from annoying my elders they would have turned me out of the school, telling me that I was thoroughly disloyal to it; that I had no intention of learning; that I was mocking and distracting the boys who did wish to learn; that I was a liar and a shirker and a seditious little nuisance; and that nothing could injure me in character and degrade their occupation more than allowing me (much less forcing me) to remain in the school under such conditions. But in order to get expelled, it was necessary commit a crime of such atrocity that the parents of other boys would have threatened to remove their sons sooner than allow them to be schoolfellows with the delinquent. I can remember only one case in which such a penalty was threatened; and in that case the culprit, a boarder, had kissed a housemaid, or possibly, being a handsome youth, been kissed by her. She did not kiss me; and nobody ever dreamt of expelling me. The truth was, a boy meant just so much a year to the institution. That was why he was kept there against his will. That was why he was kept there when his expulsion would have been an unspeakable relief and benefit both to his teachers and himself.|$|E
