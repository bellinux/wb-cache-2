The quality of the pigment itself foreshadows Goya's later works: a granular solution producing a matte, sandy finish.

5000|$|Angeli {{moved from}} Rome {{to his native}} city of Venice in 1652 and began {{publishing}} on the method of <b>indivisibles.</b> The method had been under attack by Jesuits Paul Guldin, Mario Bettini, and André Tacquet. Angeli's first response appeared in an [...] "Appendix pro indibisibilibus," [...] attached to his 1658 book Problemata geometrica sexaginta, and was aimed at Bettini. Alexander (2014) shows how <b>indivisibles</b> and infinitesimals were perceived as a theological threat and opposed on doctrinal grounds in the 17th century. The opposition was spearheaded by clerics and more specifically by the Jesuits. In 1632 (the year Galileo was summoned to stand trial over heliocentrism) the Society's Revisors General led by father Jacob Bidermann banned teaching <b>indivisibles</b> in their schools (Alexander p. 17). Cavalieri's <b>indivisibles</b> and Galileo Galilei's heliocentrism were systematically opposed by the Jesuits and attacked through a spectrum of means, be it mathematical, academic, political, or religious (Alexander, Part I). Bettini called the method of <b>indivisibles</b> [...] "counterfeit philosophizing" [...] and sought to discredit it through a discussion of a paradox presented in Galileo's Discorsi. Angeli analyzes Bettini's position and proves it untenable (Alexander, p. 168).|$|R

5|$|The French ships {{followed}} Swiftsure by tacking {{into the}} wind and a complicated chase developed, with Jean Bart and Constitution maintaining {{the pressure on the}} slow moving British vessel, while the rest of Ganteaume's squadron used the prevailing wind to push far ahead of the ongoing chase before tacking at 08:00 across Hallowell's intended course. Unless Hallowell could escape the trap, his ship would be caught between the two French divisions and overwhelmed. For six hours Hallowell continued his efforts to escape, but the French ships were too fast, Ganteaume's force passing some distance ahead of the British ship and then turning back towards him so that by 14:00 Swiftsure was at serious risk of being surrounded. Hallowell determined that his only option was to attempt to drive though those ships of Ganteaume's division that blocked his passage to leeward, the ships of the line <b>Indivisible</b> (under Pierre-Paulin Gourrège) and Dix-Août (under Louis-Marie Le Gouardin) and the frigate Créole.|$|E
5|$|For {{three days}} Peard sailed north and east, on several {{occasions}} believing {{that he had lost}} the French only for Ganteaume's ships to reappear over the horizon once more as light winds hampered his escape. At dawn on 13 February, Peard realised that he would eventually be caught and defeated, and swung Success back towards the west, hoping that by doing so he would lead the French straight into any British forces that might now be searching for Ganteaume. The plan failed when the wind disappeared completely at noon, and by 15:00 two French ships of the line had approached within gunshot. Hopelessly outnumbered, the frigate surrendered without further resistance and was attached to the French squadron as Succès, the crew provided by detachments from other vessels. Peard and his men joined the prisoners taken from Incendiary and Sprightly on Ganteaume's flagship <b>Indivisible</b> and were closely questioned as to British movements in the Mediterranean. When interrogated, Peard informed Ganteaume that the invasion of Egypt was already underway, that the Eastern Mediterranean was controlled by a powerful fleet under Lord Keith and that a squadron under Sir John Borlase Warren was actively hunting the French and could appear at any moment.|$|E
5|$|The {{cases that}} were known in West Berlin {{provoked}} demonstrations among the population. Members of the Senate inspected the crime scenes {{and spoke to}} the press as well as public audiences. Various groups, and also individuals, launched protest campaigns against the Wall and the shootings. The fact that Peter Fechter bled to death in plain view of the public without anybody being able to help him lead to spontaneous mass demonstrations, which in turn resulted in riots in the following night. West Berlin policemen and US soldiers prevented a storming of the Wall. Buses bringing Soviet soldiers to the Tiergarten where they were to guard the Soviet War Memorial were pelted with stones by protesters. The incident also lead to anti-American protests, which were condemned by Willy Brandt. In the ensuing time, loudspeaker cars were sporadically set up at the Wall, urging the GDR border guards not to shoot at refugees and warning them of possible consequences. As a result of the shootings, West German groups lodged complaints with the UN Commission on Human Rights. The non-partisan Kuratorium Unteilbares Deutschland (Committee for an <b>Indivisible</b> Germany) sold protest placards and lapel pins in all of West Germany against the border regime and its consequences. Initially, West Berlin's regulatory authorities gave fugitives covering fire if they were being fired at by GDR border guards. This resulted in at least one lethal incident on 23 May 1962, when the border guard Peter Göring was shot dead by a West Berlin policeman while firing 44 times at a fleeing boy.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThough Wallis's Arithmetica infinitorum {{was one of}} Newton's {{major sources}} of {{inspiration}} during {{the first years of}} his mathematical education, <b>indivisibles</b> were not a central feature of his mathematical production. To judge from his reading notes, he firstly studied Wallis's treatise at the beginning of 1664 ([13], I, 1, 3, § § 1 - 2, pp. 89 - 95), and came back to it one year later ([13], I, 1, 3, § 3, pp. 96 - 121). In the former occasion, he confined himself to {{the first part of the}} treatise, and possibly accompanied his reading with that of the De sectionibus conicis and the De angulo contactus, also contained in Wallis's Operum Mathematicarum Pars Altera ([16] and [17]). At the beginning, his attention was retained by some general remarks, but very often shifted to the elaboration of an original, algebraic version of the method of <b>indivisibles,</b> which he applied to get both a correct quadrature of the parabola and an incorrect quadrature of the hyperbola. In the latter occasion, he rather focused on Wallis's quadrature of the circle—which he deeply transformed ([15], pp. 152 - 181) —whiteout any particular attention to <b>indivisibles.</b> Only the notes relative to the former reading deserve to be considered here. Section 1 is devoted to them. Sections 2 and 3 document the important but often implicit role <b>indivisibles</b> and infinitesimals play in Newton's mathematics and his reluctance to accept them. The differences between <b>indivisibles</b> and infinitesimals, and their roles in Newton's mathematics are difficult to grasp because Newton himself equivocated about them. As we shall see in sections 2 and 3, he used both <b>indivisibles</b> and infinitesimals (but infinitesimals, particularly) abundantly, but starting in 1671, he explicitly ascribed to them a subordinated status vis-` a-vis fluxions and " evanescent " quantities and ratios. This did not prevent him from using in the Principia some principles and arguments closely remembering the method of <b>indivisibles.</b> The end of section 3 and section 4 focus on some examples of this use. The latter is, in particular, devoted the proof of two theorems (propositions LXXI and LXXIV of Book I), where this use is quite manifest...|$|R
5|$|The pre-Socratic Greek {{philosophers}} and Indian philosophers developed {{some of the}} earliest philosophical concepts of the Universe. The earliest Greek philosophers noted that appearances can be deceiving, and sought to understand the underlying reality behind the appearances. In particular, they noted the ability of matter to change forms (e.g., ice to water to steam) and several philosophers proposed that all the physical materials in the world are different forms of a single primordial material, or arche. The first to do so was Thales, who proposed this material to be water. Thales' student, Anaximander, proposed that everything came from the limitless apeiron. Anaximenes proposed the primordial material to be air on account of its perceived attractive and repulsive qualities that cause the arche to condense or dissociate into different forms. Anaxagoras proposed the principle of Nous (Mind), while Heraclitus proposed fire (and spoke of logos). Empedocles proposed the elements to be earth, water, air and fire. His four-element model became very popular. Like Pythagoras, Plato believed that all things were composed of number, with Empedocles' elements taking the form of the Platonic solids. Democritus, and later philosophers—most notably Leucippus—proposed that the Universe is composed of <b>indivisible</b> atoms moving through void (vacuum), although Aristotle did not believe that to be feasible because air, like water, offers resistance to motion. Air will immediately rush in to fill a void, and moreover, without resistance, it would do so indefinitely fast.|$|E

5000|$|The {{concept of}} infinitesimals was {{originally}} introduced around 1670 by either Nicolaus Mercator or Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. [...] Archimedes used what eventually {{came to be}} known as the method of <b>indivisibles</b> in his work The Method of Mechanical Theorems to find areas of regions and volumes of solids. In his formal published treatises, Archimedes solved the same problem using the method of exhaustion. The 15th century saw the work of Nicholas of Cusa, further developed in the 17th century by Johannes Kepler, in particular calculation of area of a circle by representing the latter as an infinite-sided polygon. Simon Stevin's work on decimal representation of all numbers in the 16th century prepared the ground for the real continuum. Bonaventura Cavalieri's method of <b>indivisibles</b> led to an extension of the results of the classical authors. The method of <b>indivisibles</b> related to geometrical figures as being composed of entities of codimension 1. John Wallis's infinitesimals differed from <b>indivisibles</b> in that he would decompose geometrical figures into infinitely thin building blocks of the same dimension as the figure, preparing the ground for general methods of the integral calculus. He exploited an infinitesimal denoted 1/∞ in area calculations.|$|R
