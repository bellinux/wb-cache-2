25|$|The main {{script and}} {{branching}} storylines {{were written by}} author and screenwriter Satoru Akahori. Hiroi revealed that the setting of Sakura Wars was based on his family history, so felt that it would lose its entertainment value if he wrote the game's script himself. Hiroi had previously worked with Akahori on other projects, so Akahori was brought on board. When Akahori first heard the concept before talking with Hiroi, <b>he</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> {{said it would be}} better to try blending the stories of Haikara-san ga Tōru and Teito Monogatari. He was later convinced to join the project after talking with Hiroi. When first pitched the project, all that had been finalized was that the story would involve young girls and mecha. Akahori was unsure how to approach the project as he had never written for a video game, but Hiroi told him to write the story like an anime television. When Akahori first joined the team, the story was still in an unfinished state: the only points finalized were its setting, overall theme of steampunk mecha combat, and a cast of five or six characters. Akahori's early work was focused on expanding the narrative and characters based on Hiroi's draft. Due to the deep connection to Hiroi's family history, Akahori could not work on the script by himself, needing frequent consultation with Hiroi. Hiroi also insisted on making frequent changes if Akahori's work did not fall in line with his vision. Akahori wrote a thirteen-episode storyline for the game, with the final battle taking place across three episodes. After talks with staff, the final battle was condensed into a single chapter, bringing the game to its current ten-episode length. Kaneko and Morita created the additional dialogue around Akahori's main scenario, along with other duties such as script editing and debugging.|$|E
500|$|In January 1970, Rolling Stone asked Hendrix {{about having}} {{testified that he}} stopped using cannabis; <b>he</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> replied: [...] "At least, stop it from growing". When pressed he answered: [...] "I'm too... wrecked right now." [...] His {{management}} was concerned that the incident might provoke cancellations during the concurrent tour, but the story stayed largely unknown until after the tour had ended. His public relations manager, Michael Goldstein, later revealed that he had bribed {{a member of the}} Associated Press with a case of liquor to prevent the story from going out on the wire. Goldstein commented: [...] "I knew that a million dollars was riding on that story not getting on UPI and the AP wire... By his nature, a press agent shouldn't have to determine someone's future." ...|$|E
500|$|Berkowitz (real name Scott Putesky) later {{claimed to}} have been [...] "shut out" [...] of {{recording}} sessions, and alleged that other band members destroyed much of his equipment—the four-track recorder, which had been used to produce many of the band's early demos, had been microwaved, and his drum machine had been discarded. The latter was subsequently revealed to have been thrown from a second-story window. He was also highly critical of Reznor, whom he alleged destroyed a Fender Jaguar which had been given to him by his father as a child, saying: [...] "I was in the studio, and they were all in the control room, and I'm playing guitar. At the end, Trent says, 'Do it again, but do it more like this.' We went through this three times, and he says, 'Hold on. I'll come in there. Let me show you what I'm talking about.' So I take my guitar off, hand it to him—and he smashes it, just to fuck with me. Then <b>he</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> left the room." ...|$|E

500|$|On September 11, 1970, Hendrix {{gave his}} final {{interview}} in his suite at the Cumberland Hotel in London, where he talked with Keith Altham, a journalist for Record Mirror. During the interview, Hendrix confirmed reports that Billy Cox, the bass player in his band, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, was leaving. Cox, who had been suffering from severe exhaustion and was exhibiting symptoms of paranoia, mutually agreed with Hendrix that they should suspend their plans to collaborate musically. When Altham asked Hendrix: [...] "Do you feel any kind of compulsion to prove yourself as King Guitar", Hendrix replied: [...] "No, I don't even let that bother me. Because they {{say a lot of}} things about people that, if they let it bother them, they wouldn't even be around today... King Guitar now? Wow, that's a bit heavy." [...] Altham also suggested that Hendrix invented psychedelic music, to which <b>he</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> replied: [...] "A mad scientist approach... I don't consider [...] the invention of psychedelic, it's just asking a lot of questions." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{suggestion}} is that the Cheyenne warriors, pressed to recount details of the Custer battle, were still reluctant to admit to killing soldiers for fear of punishment. A simple {{way out of this}} dilemma was to say when questioned by non-Indians that most of the soldiers died at their own hands. Researchers Fox and Thom Hatch say that Wooden Leg retracted the claim in later life; this would have been in extreme old age, as he had still not recanted at the age of 73 when the book was written, other than to say it was whisky that was the cause rather than prayer. In his book Cheyenne Memories, John Stands In Timber, tribal historian for the Northern Cheyenne, agrees: [...] "Wooden Leg said some other things (in his book) he took back later. One was that the soldiers were drunk, and many killed themselves. I went with two army men to see him one time. They wanted to find out about it. I interpreted... and we asked him if it were true that the Indians said the soldiers did that. <b>He</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> said there were just too many Indians. The soldiers did their best. He said if they had been drunk they would not have killed as many as they did. But it was in the book." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the heart}} of this scene is Cable's song [...] "You've Got to Be Carefully Taught", in which Cable realizes the sources of his own racism. [...] Its frank lyrics made it perhaps the most {{controversial}} element of the show. Michener recalled in his memoirs that a delegation of New Englanders had approached him after a New Haven tryout and urged him to recommend the song's removal to Rodgers and Hammerstein. [...] When Michener told Hammerstein, <b>he</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> replied, [...] "That's what the show is about!" [...] Boston drama critic Elliot Norton, after seeing the show in tryouts, strongly recommended its removal, or at least that Cable sing it less [...] "briskly", as there was much bigotry in Boston; Logan replied that that was all the more reason for leaving it unaltered. Several New York reviewers expressed discomfort with the song; Wolcott Gibbs wrote of [...] "something called 'You've Got to Be Taught', a poem in praise of tolerance that somehow I found a little embarrassing" [...] while John Mason Brown opined that he was [...] "somewhat distressed by the dragged-in didacticism of such a plea for tolerance as 'You've Got to Be Taught'". After the Broadway opening, Hammerstein received a large number of letters concerning [...] "You've Got to Be Carefully Taught". [...] Judging by the letters that remain among his papers in the Library of Congress, the reaction was mixed. One correspondent wrote [...] "What can I say to a man who writes, 'You've got to be taught to hate and fear?'... Now that I know you, I feel that my informants didn't praise you enough." [...] Nevertheless, another wrote, [...] "I feel the inclusion of the song particularly in the album and to some extent in the show itself is not helpful to the cause of brotherhood, your intent to the contrary notwithstanding".|$|E

500|$|In 1923, when Adams was 76, the {{following}} newspaper story appeared in The Salt Lake Tribune, telling of his whereabouts:Perhaps you old fellows, too, thought Yank had passed on, {{but he turned}} up in New York {{the other day and}} is now spending his last days in a Bronx flat. There was a time when Yank Adams was known in every billiard room in America. He was as much at home in Eddie Graney's room at San Francisco as at Tom Foley's in Chicago of Maurice Daly's in New York, and he knew all the billiard players and big and little room keepers from coast to coast. When the history of billiards is written and the names of Willie Hoppe, old and young Jake Schaefer and Welker Cochran are included with others of the great exponents of the indoor sport, there will be a distinct division for one man—the man who did the impossible, who could make the ivories travel the wrong way, or, {{in the language of the}} billiard realm, [...] "make 'em talk all languages." [...] That man is Frank B. Adams, known the world over as [...] "Yank" [...] Adams, at one time and even now the world's only finger billiardist who can make all the apparently impossible shots on the table without the aid of a cue. Adams is 76 years old, and after fifty years of exhibitions all over the [...] world has retired from active work to live in the Bronx and conduct a billiard academy of his own at Burnside and Creston avenues in New York with his business manager for the last ten years, Samuel Polakoff. Yank now lives at 635 West 136th street In New York. When I told Tom Foley, the daddy of all the roommkeepers, that Yank Adams was back in the business <b>he</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> said: [...] "I thought Yank had cashed in. But he's like all those billiard players. They never die." ...|$|E

2500|$|In September 2010, {{a fan of}} Dream Theater {{discovered}} {{that all of the}} letters of [...] "DOMINICI" [...] fit together perfectly into the Majesty symbol.

[...] This has earlier also been discovered as shown on the comment section of DTFAQ and in the DTNorway Podcast Episode 2 from 2008, with Charlie Dominici.|$|E

2500|$|In 1968, {{after the}} premiere of the {{international}} film Candy (1968), Cavett went to {{a party at the}} Americana Hotel, where those who had just seen the film were being interviewed for TV.. He later said [...] "When the interviewer, Pat Paulsen, got to me, he asked what I thought the critics would say about Candy. I said I didn't think it would be reviewed by the regular critics, {{that they would have to}} reconvene the Nuremberg Trials to do it justice. <b>He</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> asked what I had liked, and I said I liked the lady who showed me the nearest exit so that I would not be forced to vomit indoors." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} we {{returned}} down Broadway, {{it seemed to me}} that the city was flying before some awful calamity. [...] "Why," [...] said I, [...] "Colonel, what under heaven is the matter? Everyone appears to be pitching out their furniture, and packing it off." [...] <b>He</b> <b>laughed,</b> <b>and</b> said this was the general [...] "moving day." [...] Such a sight nobody ever saw unless it was in this same city. It seemed a kind of frolic, as if they were changing houses just for fun. Every street was crowded with carts, drays, and people. So the world goes. It would take a good deal to get me out of my log-house; but here, I understand, many persons [...] "move" [...] every year.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{cartoons}} {{proved to be}} very popular and were soon syndicated in the United States and overseas, being published in newspapers in fifty countries world-wide, Roberto's company had closed down and the couple [...] "found themselves living in the US illegally, 'trying to find jobs that would keep us {{one step ahead of}} the Immigration Department'". By 1971 they had travelled to New Zealand, where they were married on 24 July 1971 at St. Andrew's Church, Epsom, Auckland – the same church in which her parents were married in 1936. Casali wore a crown of daisies and a shoulder-length veil that she had previously drawn on 'her' character in the cartoon. Casali said of the marriage: [...] "My father had died when I was young, so when Roberto asked me to get married I agreed, but said, 'Whatever you do, don't die on me.' <b>He</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> promised to stick around." [...] In January 1972, with Love is... by now a successful and lucrative product licensed for reproduction on mugs, T-shirts, calendars, posters and greetings cards, they moved to Weybridge, England, and bought a second home in Los Angeles. At the height of their popularity in the 1970s, {{the cartoons}} were earning Casali £4–5 million annually.|$|E

2500|$|The {{night before}} {{they entered the}} Jin Capital, the emperor of China was worried about saving the two {{previous}} emperors in the Jin Capital and ordered the generals to come back. The generals avoided the idea at first, but the emperor began to send more letters and even threatened killing the soldiers' families. Yue Fei in tears stated, [...] "Thirty years of effort now is wasted." [...] The generals were ordered back to the imperial court, and this time met with chancellor Qin Hui {{and many of the}} officials and generals who supported the peace policy of the court. They imprisoned General Yue Fei and were about to sentence him when Han Shizhong asked Qin Hui, [...] "Upon what charges?". Qin Hui simply stated, [...] "For Yue's guilt, Isn't there evidence? (其事体莫須有)"(It become a famous sentence in Chinese history) Han then replied, [...] "How can you satisfy people's demand for justice with a logical fallacy such as 'Isn't there evidence?'" [...] Later, Han was so outraged than <b>he</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> threw his helmet and sword, which were both symbols of the authority of a Chinese general, at him. He attacked the emperor and Qin Hui with these insulting words: [...] "They brought their nations into ruins, and there will no longer be any more able generals that will fight for the Song." [...] Originally Qin wanted to kill Han next, but Han saved the emperor in a past battle, so Han would live.|$|E
