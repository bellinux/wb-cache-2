On the journey they become close friends. Halfway through their journey, their camp is ambushed by the Ra'zac and a stranger named Murtagh rescues them, but Brom is gravely injured. In his dying breath, Brom reveals to Eragon that <b>he</b> <b>once</b> <b>was</b> a Dragon Rider and his Dragon was also named Saphira.|$|E

In the past {{he had been able to}} “feel twilight gather” but something has changed and he’s no longer as sure as <b>he</b> <b>once</b> <b>was.</b> It appears that these two have been abandoned or forgotten when the populous fled the area. Sometimes he thinks he hears people and wonders if they are coming back.|$|E
25|$|However, {{aside from}} {{playing in a}} {{practice}} match, Azhar {{did not get a}} chance to participate in the World Cup and Pakistan's early exit from the tournament meant that he was once again, in line for being axed from the national squad. Following his exclusion, Azhar returned to playing county cricket in UK. Over the years, due to his constant exclusion from the Pakistani squad {{and the fact that he}} has crossed the 30-year-old mark, it seems that Mahmood is not as interested in returning to the Pakistani line up as <b>he</b> <b>once</b> <b>was.</b> His weight gain, mediocre performances in ODIs, combined with the tough competition for the all rounder slot in the Pakistani line up meant that his chances for making a return to the national squad were very limited. He has previously signed with the defunct Indian Cricket League (ICL) and had been released from his central contract.|$|E

25|$|Junior Seau was an American NFL player, and is {{a typical}} example of an {{individual}} with PTSD. He was born on January 19, 1969 and died on May 2, 2012. Seau was a very beneficial asset to the teams that he played for; throughout his career he played for San Diego Chargers from 1990 to 2002, Miami Dolphins from 2003–2005 and New England Patriots from 2006–2009. He played linebacker for all three teams and had extensive experience in this role, despite many injuries throughout his career. After his career at the NFL he developed differences in his personality, due to brain injury; these changes consisted of impaired self-control and regulation, sensitive emotionally and also {{he was not able}} to socialise as <b>he</b> <b>once</b> <b>was</b> able to, which then led to alienation, something which was a strong opposite to his original personality. From there he developed insomnia and committed suicide via a self-inflicted gunshot to his heart.|$|E
25|$|Mulch is a kleptomaniac, {{criminal}} dwarf who {{has been}} involved in crime for about 300 years. When considered with the average Dwarf life span he is not that old, making him nice and spry, a good advantage for a criminal. <b>He</b> <b>once</b> <b>was</b> a mining dwarf, but later decided that stealing from Mud Men (in other words, humans) suited him much better. Because he has stolen from 'Mud Men' Mulch no longer has any significant magic powers of the usual fairy, however he has retained the gift of tongues, and has even shown his ability to speak 'American Dog' in The Arctic Incident. He insists that humans were stealing from fairy-kind and the earth and that he is simply taking them back or repossessing the items. In the early books, he assisted the LEP against Artemis Fowl, although later, he sides with Artemis Fowl. But eventually, when the fairies and Artemis are on stable ground, he joins forces with The People on many adventures, acting as a LEP helper at the beginning of The Time Paradox.|$|E
25|$|The {{win over}} the title-contending Cobb gave Norton another shot at a {{potential}} title-fight, and on May 11, 1981. at Madison Square Garden {{he stepped into the}} ring with top contender Gerry Cooney, who, like Cobb, was undefeated entering the fight. Very early in the fight it became clear that Norton was no longer the caliber of fighter <b>he</b> <b>once</b> <b>was,</b> as Cooney's first punch caused Norton's legs to buckle. Norton continued to take shots from Cooney in his corner for nearly a full minute before Perez, who refereed his last fight, stepped in to stop the bout 54 seconds in, as Norton was slumped in his corner. Norton decided to retire following the match and turned his attention to charitable pursuits. Norton's enduring legacy as a fighter is that he is considered second to Joe Frazier as Ali's main nemesis and toughest opponent. Norton fought Ali to three decisions and was never hurt or knocked down. All three bouts were close and subject to controversy. Unfortunately, Norton was less successful against three of the greatest punchers of all time, losing by KO to Foreman and Shavers and by TKO to Cooney. Norton was considered past his prime in boxing from 1979 to 1981.|$|E

25|$|Arriving at Norway during winter, Gudrid is {{amazed that}} {{the trees are}} huge {{compared}} to {{the ones on the}} islands. When the group goes ashore to make camp, they are suddenly attacked by a bear that is awake despite winter. The bear almost kills Thorfinn and Einar, but is suddenly killed by a crossbow quarrel. A female hunter emerges from the wood and intrudes herself as Hild, daughter of Hrafnkell. Hild skins the bear and lets the group have the meat. While enjoying a bear meat stew, Hild and the group get along quite well, chatting friendly with each other. However, Hild suddenly reveals that she recognizes Thorfinn as the one who killed her father when her home was attacked by Askeladd's warband 8 years before. Thorfinn remembers the attack and admits that he is guilty. Hild almost shoots Thornfinn with her crossbow but hesitates because Karli is strapped to his back. Hild tell the group that she poisoned the soup and will throw the antidote away unless Thorfinn follow her into the woods alone to face her. Thorfinn agrees, swearing to his comrades that he will not die, nor will he hurt Hild. Thorfinn initially keeps himself at bay while evading Hild's quarrels, but he finally figures out her position and charges her. However, he is taken completely by surprise by Hild's specially crafted crossbow's ability to reload rapidly, taking multiple quarrels to his legs. Thorfinn's comrades arrive despite Hild's threat and try to convince Hild that Thorfinn is not the person <b>he</b> <b>once</b> <b>was,</b> and Thonfinn himself begs for time to atone for his sins. Hild remains unconvinced and is about to finish Thorfinn off, but she sees a vision of her father and her old hunting master which causes her to miss. Although she cannot forgive Thorfinn, she agrees to give him time to try and complete his mission. Hild decides to travel with the group {{to keep an eye on}} Thorfinn and swears that if he shows any signs of abandoning his mission to create a land of peace, she will kill him at last.|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately" [...] is {{described}} as an uptempo dance song.

[...] "I never ask for more than I deserve, you know it's the truth. You seem to think you're God's gift to this earth. I'm telling you no way", Jackson sings. Veda A.

Life is also about what you do". Vibe noted that with [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately", Jackson stands up for men.

Ed Gonzalez from Slant Magazine commented, [...] "Nothing sends me into a trembling, corner-cowering stupor than a giggly, under-enunciated Janet Jackson jam." ...|$|E

He possesses the Particle Style, a kekkei tota that combines Fire, Earth, and Wind elements to create three-dimensional shapes capable of disintegrating anything it touches, as well as the ability to alter gravity, enabling him flight. He is very proud, despite his frailty, and shows little respect to those much younger than him. During the Kage Summit, he admitted to have frequently hired Akatsuki. He defended his action, stating that the use of Akatsuki was necessary to protect themselves while still demilitarizing, but this and his advanced age still lead Mifune to deny him leadership of the forces to lead against Akatsuki. When Sasuke intrudes on the meeting room chasing after Danzo, he refuses {{to take part in the}} fight. Due to Gaara's actions and words during the meeting, Onoki reverts back to the noble man <b>he</b> <b>once</b> <b>was</b> before he became hard-headed. Later, he goes out to find Kabuto and prevent him from finding Killer Bee and Naruto and succeeds in protecting them. Throughout the war, Onoki's techniques proved instrumental in keeping Alliance members alive and he becomes the de-facto leader in the assault against the real Madara Uchiha. Years later, Onoki retires due to his failing health and passes down his title to his granddaughter, Kurotsuchi. He is voiced by Tomomichi Nishimura in the Japanese anime, while in the English adaptation, he is voiced by Steven Blum.|$|E
