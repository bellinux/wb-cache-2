SUMMARY An instrument has been developed that will enable an observer to make a rapid field estimation of the rate of evaporation of water from freshly placed Portland Cement Concrete. The instrument permits field personnel to rapidly determine the evaporation rate and to anticipate when protective measures such as use of fog spray must be used. The details of the instrument's development and theory are included. The use and operation is described and a simple graph is provided to convert the instrument reading into evaporation rate. Sketches, parts lists and construction details permit the reader to construct his own evaporometers. IMPLEMENTATION This instrument can be constructed in any shop for approximately five dollars. This test only takes one to two minutes depending on the weather conditions so it can be run as often as needed. Time for the complete test should not be more than a minute when the evaporation rate is near the critical rate mentioned by Portland Cement Association. iii CONTENTS Abstract [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Daily {{evapotranspiration}} (EVPT) of two {{bedding plants}} osteospermum 'Denebola' and impatiens 'Timor' grown on ebb-and-flow benches {{was measured by}} weighing method, together with assessment of indoor climate parameters (solar radiation, temperature, humidity) and leaf area index (LAI) at different growth phases. The evaporation inside the greenhouse as affected by climatic factors i. e. : solar radiation, temperature, humidity and air velocity was also measured using Piche's <b>evaporometer.</b> Plants were irrigated according to soil water potential (irrigation at - 0, 5; - 3; - 10 and - 20 kPa). Irrigation at high water potential decreased plant growth and leaf area of both plants. LAI of osteospermum decreased as water deficit increased. In the case of impatiens, the highest LAI at full flowering obtained plants irrigated at - 3 kPa. The actual, daily EVPT of plants irrigated at - 0, 5 kPa increased with plant growth in the case ofosteospermum while that of impatiens remained at similar level. At flowering water stress decreased strongly EVPT of osteospermum and in lesser extent EVPT of impatiens. Osteospermum irrigated at - 0, 5 kPa had 2, 5 higher EVPT than impatiens. For both plants good, positive correlation between EVPT and daily mean temperature, temperature between 7 - 17 h and evaporation according to Piche's <b>evaporometer</b> readings were obtained. As expected EVPT was negatively correlated with relative humidity, irrespective the growth phase and soil water potential. The correlation between EVPT and solar radiation, was changed during plant growth {{due to differences in}} temperature under shading screen, used during sunny days...|$|E
40|$|Uncertainty is {{typically}} {{defined as a}} potential deficiency in the modeling of a physical process, owing {{to a lack of}} knowledge. Uncertainty can be categorized as aleatoric (inherent uncertainty caused by the intrinsic randomness of the system) or epistemic (uncertainty caused by using various model simplifications and their parameters). One of the main reasons for model simplifications is a limited amount of meteorological data. This paper is devoted to the epistemic uncertainty quantification involved in two components of the hydrologic balance-evapotranspiration and net infiltration for interglacial (present day), and future monsoon, glacial transition, and glacial climates at Yucca Mountain, using the data from analogue meteorological stations. In particular, the author analyzes semi-empirical models used for evaluating (1) reference-surface potential evapotranspiration, including temperature-based models (Hargreaves-Samani, Thornthwaite, Hamon, Jensen-Haise, and Turc) and radiation-based models (Priestly-Taylor and Penman), and (2) surface-dependent potential evapotranspiration (Penman-Monteith and Shuttleworth-Wallace models). Evapotranspiration predictions are then used as inputs for the evaluation of net infiltration using the semi-empirical models of Budyko, Fu, Milly, Turc-Pike, and Zhang. Results show that net infiltration ranges are expected to generally increase from the present-day climate to monsoon climate, to glacial transition climate, and then to the glacial climate. The propagation of uncertainties through model predictions for different climates is characterized using statistical measures. Predicted evapotranspiration ranges are reasonably corroborated against the data from Class A pan <b>evaporometers</b> (taking into account evaporation-pan adjustment coefficients), and ranges of net infiltration predictions are corroborated against the geochemical and temperature-based estimates of groundwater recharge and percolation rates through the unsaturated zone obtained at Yucca Mountain...|$|R
