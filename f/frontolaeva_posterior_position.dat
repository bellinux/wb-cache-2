40|$|The {{presence}} of the residual stresses in bone tissue has been noted and the authors have reported that there are residual stresses in bone tissue. The aim of our study is to measure the residual stress distribution in the cortical bone of the extremities of vertebrates and to describe the relationships with the osteon population density. The study used the rabbit limb bones (femur, tibia/fibula, humerus, and radius/ulna) and measured the residual stresses in the bone axial direction at anterior and <b>posterior</b> <b>positions</b> on the cortical surface. The osteons at the sections at the measurement positions were observed by microscopy. As a result, the average stresses at the hindlimb bones and the forelimb bones were 210 and 149 MPa, respectively. In the femur, humerus, and radius/ulna, the residual stresses at the anterior position were larger than those at the <b>posterior</b> <b>position,</b> while in the tibia, the stress at the <b>posterior</b> <b>position</b> was larger than that at the anterior position. Further, in the femur and humerus, the osteon population densities in the anterior positions were larger {{than those in the}} <b>posterior</b> <b>positions.</b> In the tibia, the osteon population density in the <b>posterior</b> <b>position</b> was larger than that in the anterior position. Therefore, tensile residual stresses were observed at every measurement position in the rabbit limb bones and the value of residual stress correlated with the osteon population density (r= 0. 55, P< 0. 01) ...|$|R

40|$|Aim: We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the potential {{risk factors related to}} poor perinatal outcomes after cesarean section performing at full cervical dilatation. Material and Method: Fourty-nine women who underwent cesarean section at full cervical dilatation were enrolled in this retrospective case-control study. Women with poor perinatal outcome defined as the presence of admission to neonatal intensive care unit were the cases while the women without poor perinatal outcome were controls. Two groups were analyzed to determine possible risk factors for poor perinatal outcome with multivariate logistic regeression model. ROC curve analysis was used to find cut off point of duration of arrest at full cervical dilatation for poor perinatal outcomes with significant factors. Results: Of 49 women, 9 (18. 4 %) women constructed the case group while 40 (81. 6 %) women were in control group. In multivariate analysis persistent occiput <b>posterior</b> <b>position</b> was the only factor to be significant for the poor perinatal outcome after cesarean section at full cervical dilatation. The best cut-off point of duration of arrest at full cervical dilatation for poor perinatal outcome with persistent occiput <b>posterior</b> <b>position</b> established by the ROC curve was 1. 25 hour, showing a sensitivity of 75. 0 %, specificity of 50. 0 %.

50|$|Torsion {{can provide}} other advantages. For aquatic {{gastropods}} the anterior positioning {{may be useful}} for preventing sediment getting into the mantle cavity. This is more likely with <b>posterior</b> <b>positioning</b> because sediment can be stirred up by {{the motion of the}} gastropod. Another possible advantage for aquatic species is that moving the osphradium (olfactory sense organs) to an anterior position means they are sampling water the gastropod is entering rather than leaving. This may help the gastropod locate food or avoid predators. In terrestrial species ventilation is better with anterior positioning. This is due to the back and forth motion of the shell during movement which would tend to block the mantle opening against the foot if it was in a <b>posterior</b> <b>position.</b>|$|R

40|$|SummaryAimstandardization of the {{technique}} to section the extratemporal facial nerve in rats and creation of a scale to evaluate facial movements in these animals before and after surgery. Study designExperimental. Methodtwenty Wistar rats were anesthetized with ketamine xylazine and submitted to sectioning {{of the facial nerve}} near its emergence through the mastoid foramen. Eye closure and blinking reflex, vibrissae movement and positioning were observed in all animals and a scale to evaluate these parameters was then created. ResultsThe facial nerve trunk was found between the tendinous margin of the clavotrapezius muscle and the auricular cartilage. The trunk was proximally sectioned as it exits the mastoid foramen and the stumps were sutured with a 9 - 0 -nylon thread. An evaluation and graduation scale of facial movements, independent for eye and vibrissae, was elaborated, together with a sum of the parameters, as a means to evaluate facial palsy. Absence of eye blinking and closure scored 1; the presence of orbicular muscle contraction, without blinking reflex, scored 2; 50 % of eye closure through blinking reflex, scored 3, 75 % of closure scored 4. The presence of complete eye closure and blinking reflex scored 5. The absence of movement and <b>posterior</b> <b>position</b> of the vibrissae scored 1; slight shivering and <b>posterior</b> <b>position</b> scored 2; greater shivering and <b>posterior</b> <b>position,</b> scored 3 and normal movement with <b>posterior</b> <b>position,</b> scored 4; symmetrical movement of he vibrissae, with anterior position, scored 5. ConclusionThe rat anatomy allows easy access to the extratemporal facial nerve, allowing its sectioning and standardized suture.

Six cadaveric pelvises were mounted on a custom jig. A custom guide was attached to simulate anterolateral (AL), mid-anterior (MA), distal anterolateral (DALA) and posterolateral (PL) arthroscopy portals. Anterior 3 o’clock and 4 o’clock positions were drilled using MA and DALA portals. Posterior 8 o’clock to 11 o’clock positions were drilled using a 1. 4 -mm drill bit from the PL portal. At depths of 5, 10 and 15 mm, the distance from the drill to the intra and extra-articular surfaces was measured using a custom caliper. Mean distance between drill hole and articular surface for anterior and <b>posterior</b> <b>positions</b> ranged from 1. 61 to 2. 75 mm at 5 mm. The smallest distance between the drill hole and articular surface and the largest width between drill hole and the extra-articular surface were at the 4 o’clock position.

40|$|AIM: To {{test whether}} there is a {{relationship}} between head and cervical posture and dentofacial morphology in patients with temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis/osteoarthrosis (OA). METHODS: The subjects consisted of 34 Japanese females with TMJ OA (aged 24. 7 +/- 6. 1 years). Six craniocervical angular measurements were constructed for head posture. Two angular and 6 linear measurements were constructed for the skeletal relationship, while 1 angular and 6 linear measurements were constructed for the dental relationship. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between head posture and dentofacial variables. RESULTS: In the skeletal relationship, increased craniocervical angulations were significantly associated with a more <b>posterior</b> <b>position</b> of the maxilla, a decreased Frankfort to mandibular plane angle, decreased mandibular length, and a decreased lower facial height. In the dental relationship, increased craniocervical angulations were significantly associated with more <b>posterior</b> <b>positions</b> of the anterior teeth to the basal bone and decreased alveolar height of the anterior-posterior teeth.

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: Risk {{factors for}} severe perineal {{lacerations}} are nowadays well-known and they include operative vaginal deliveries and extractions in occiput <b>posterior</b> (OP) <b>positions.</b> The {{aim of this}} study was to assess whether OP position increases the risk for anal sphincter injury when compared with occiput anterior (OA) positions in operative deliveries using Thierry's spatulas. METHODS: Retrospective study of 163 extractions with Thierry's spatulas over a five-year period (January 2000 to December 2005) performed in a general hospital. Singleton cephalic pregnancies at term were studied and the incidence of severe perineal lacerations was noted in deliveries in OP and OA positions. RESULTS: In these 163 cases, the varieties of presentation obtained by vaginal examination were 129 in anterior and 34 in <b>posterior</b> <b>positions.</b> Eleven <b>posterior</b> <b>positions</b> rotated anteriorly on delivery and 23 remained in a <b>posterior</b> <b>position.</b> The OA group (n= 140) and the OP group (n= 23) were constituted. Anal sphincter injury occurred significantly more often in the OP group compared with the OA group (17. 4 % versus 2. 9 %, p= 0. 014) with an odds ratio of 7. 1 (95 % CI 1. 6 - 31). Only one fourth-degree laceration was noted. Within the OP group, the incidence of vaginal lacerations was increased compared to the OA group, but without any significant difference (43. 5 % versus 27. 9 %, p= 0. 20). In a logistic regression model, the OP position was 6. 4 times (95 % CI 1. 3 - 31. 5) more likely to be associated with anal sphincter injury than OA position. The incidence of OP position was 14. 1 % within the whole population studied and Thierry's spatulas permit anterior rotations of occipito posterior presentation in only 32. 4 % of cases. CONCLUSION: The efficiency of Thierry's spatulas is proven. As with forceps and vacuum extractors, extraction with Thierry's spatulas is a risk factor for perineal laceration compared to a spontaneous delivery. In deliveries with spatulas, OP head positions further increase this perineal risk against OA positions. OP positions before fetal extractions do not seem to be an ideal situation for using spatulas, even if an anterior rotation is achieved in one-third of cases...|$|R
