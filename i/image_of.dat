40|$|Thoroughly and {{systematically}} presents the state-of-the-art in the diagnostic uses of radiologic imaging and nuclear {{medicine in the}} diagnosis and management of infectious and inflammatory diseases Although our understanding of microorganisms has advanced significantly and antimicrobial therapy has become increasingly available, infection remains {{a major cause of}} patient morbidity and mortality. <b>Imaging</b> <b>of</b> infection and inflammation provides a classic example of radiology and nuclear medicine’s strengths as well as weaknesses in the discovery and diagnosis of disease. Fortunately, the weaknesses are subsiding as new studies and techniques point to better planning and precision in the use of single and combined imaging modalities. Diagnostic <b>Imaging</b> <b>of</b> Infections and Inflammatory Diseases: A Multidisciplinary Approach deals with the very latest developments in the use of radiologic techniques and modalities in the management of patients with a host of infectious and inflammatory diseases.
