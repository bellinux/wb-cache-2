5|$|The wartime {{authorities}} in both Britain and America produced {{a wide variety}} of documentary films. Their purposes included military training, advice to civilians, and <b>encouragement</b> <b>to</b> maintain security. Since these films often carried messages, they grade into propaganda. Similarly, commercially produced films often combined information, support for the war effort, and a degree of propaganda. Newsreels, ostensibly simply for information, were made in both Allied and Axis countries, and were often dramatised. More recently, in the Iran-Iraq War, Morteza Avini's Ravayat-e Fath (Chronicles of Victory) television series combined front-line footage with commentary.|$|E
5|$|A pagan {{backlash}} against Christianity followed Æthelberht's death in 616, forcing Justus and Mellitus {{to flee to}} Gaul. The pair probably took refuge with Chlothar, hoping that the Frankish king would intervene and restore them to their sees, and by 617 Justus had been reinstalled in his bishopric by the new king. Mellitus also returned to England, but the prevailing pagan mood did not allow {{him to return to}} London; after Laurence's death, Mellitus became Archbishop of Canterbury. According to Bede, Justus received letters of encouragement from Pope Boniface V (619–625), as did Mellitus, although Bede does not record the actual letters. The historian J. M. Wallace-Hadrill assumes that both letters were general statements of <b>encouragement</b> <b>to</b> the missionaries.|$|E

5|$|Nasser also {{attempted}} to maintain {{oversight of the}} country's civil service {{to prevent it from}} inflating and consequently becoming a burden to the state. New laws provided workers with a minimum wage, profit shares, free education, free health care, reduced working hours, and <b>encouragement</b> <b>to</b> participate in management. Land reforms guaranteed the security of tenant farmers, promoted agricultural growth, and reduced rural poverty. As a result of the 1962 measures, government ownership of Egyptian business reached 51percent, and the National Union was renamed the Arab Socialist Union (ASU). With these measures came more domestic repression, as thousands of Islamists were imprisoned, including dozens of military officers. Nasser's tilt toward a Soviet-style system led his aides Boghdadi and Hussein el-Shafei to submit their resignations in protest.|$|E

A third, Olga Bridgman, would serve on the faculty at University of California—Berkeley and San Francisco—for over forty years.|$|E
5|$|The black elite in {{the towns}} donated to the settlers' {{patriotic}} funds and organisations, and also set up their own. A war fundraising tea organised by black Salisburians in early March 1915 boasted entertainment {{in the form of}} a black choir, as well as the presence of Taylor and a junior native commissioner, each of whom gave speeches in English, Sindebele and Shona. Rural black people, by contrast, did not generally understand the concept of donating money to war funds, and misinterpreted <b>encouragement</b> <b>to</b> do so as being threatened with a new tax. When the Matabele chief Gambo began collecting war donations from his people in early 1915, also urging other chiefs to do the same, he took care to thoroughly explain the war fund's purpose and the voluntary nature of contributing, but some villagers still misunderstood and came to believe they would have livestock confiscated if they did not give money. The Company ultimately sent officials around the countryside to clarify the matter.|$|E

With the addition of an infrared sensor and cockpit interface enhancements, the 87th production single-seat AV-8B became the first Harrier II to be modified for night attacks, leaving the McDonnell Douglas production line in June 1987. Flight tests proved successful and the night attack capability was validated. The first of 66 AV-8B(NA)s was delivered to the USMC in September 1989. An equivalent version of the AV-8B(NA) also served with the RAF under the designation GR7; earlier GR5 aircraft were subsequently upgraded to GR7 standards.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge fled behind Confederate lines. He was {{commissioned}} a brigadier general and then {{expelled from the}} Senate. Following the Battle of Shiloh in 1862, {{he was promoted to}} major general, and in October he was assigned to the Army of Mississippi under Braxton Bragg. After Bragg charged that Breckinridge's drunkenness had contributed to defeats at Stone River and Missionary Ridge, and after Breckinridge joined many other high-ranking officers in criticizing Bragg, he was transferred to the Trans-Allegheny Department, where he won his most significant victory in the 1864 Battle of New Market. After participating in Jubal Early's campaigns in the Shenandoah Valley, Breckinridge was charged with defending supplies in Tennessee and Virginia. In February 1865, Confederate President Jefferson Davis appointed him Secretary of War. Concluding that the war was hopeless, he urged Davis to arrange a national surrender. After the fall of Richmond, Breckinridge ensured the preservation of Confederate records. He then escaped the country and lived abroad for more than three years. When President Andrew Johnson extended amnesty to all former Confederates in 1868, Breckinridge returned to Kentucky, but resisted all <b>encouragement</b> <b>to</b> resume his political career. War injuries sapped his health, and he died in 1875. Breckinridge is regarded as an effective military commander. Though well-liked in Kentucky, he was reviled by many in the North as a traitor.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation {{was to examine the}} association between sibship composition and child weight status, and to investigate maternal feeding behavior, child eating behavior, and sibling interactions during mealtimes as pathways underlying this association. Three analytic samples (N= 273, N= 274, and N= 75) were selected from an initial cohort of 301 mother-child dyads recruited from Head Start facilities in South-Central Michigan. Participants completed questionnaires, anthropometry, a videotaped laboratory mealtime observation, and 3 videotaped family mealtime observations at home. Multiple logistic regression was used to examine the association of birth order and number and sex of siblings with odds of overweight or obesity. Path analysis was used to examine maternal feeding and child eating behavior as mediators in the association of birth order with child overweight or obesity. Sibling interactions during mealtimes were coded from the family mealtime observation videos, and path analysis was used <b>to</b> examine <b>encouragements</b> <b>to</b> eat received by the index child (IC) from the sibling as a mediator in the association of birth order and sex of sibling with child body mass index z-score (BMIz). Among the analytic sample of 273, only children and youngest siblings had higher odds of overweight or obesity compared to oldest siblings. Having younger siblings and having a brother were associated with lower odds. Among the analytic sample of 274, the association between only child status and greater likelihood of overweight or obesity was fully mediated by higher maternal discouragement to eat and lower maternal praise. The association between youngest sibling status and greater likelihood of overweight or obesity was partially mediated by lower maternal praise and lower child food fussiness. Among the analytic sample of 75, being the younger sibling in a sibling dyad was associated with the IC receiving more <b>encouragements</b> <b>to</b> eat from the sibling. However, the IC having a sister compared with a brother was not associated with receiving more <b>encouragements</b> <b>to</b> eat from the sibling. The IC receiving more <b>encouragements</b> <b>to</b> eat from the sibling was associated with lower IC BMIz. Findings can help inform family-based obesity programs by guiding recommendations for family mealtime interactions...|$|R

60|$|With these {{extraordinary}} <b>encouragements</b> <b>to</b> population, {{and every}} cause of depopulation, {{as we have}} supposed, removed, the numbers would necessarily increase faster than in any society that has ever yet been known. I have mentioned, on the authority of a pamphlet published by a Dr Styles and referred to by Dr Price, that {{the inhabitants of the}} back settlements of America doubled their numbers in fifteen years. England is certainly a more healthy country than the back settlements of America, and as we have supposed every house in the island to be airy and wholesome, and the <b>encouragements</b> <b>to</b> have a family greater even than with the back settlers, no probable reason can be assigned why the population should not double itself in less, if possible, than fifteen years. But to be quite sure that we do not go beyond the truth, we will only suppose the period of doubling to be twenty-five years, a ratio of increase which is well known to have taken place throughout all the Northern States of America.|$|R

40|$|Background: Although the {{hazardous}} {{health effects of}} a sedentary lifestyle are well known, many adults struggle with regular physical activity. Simple and efficient encouragements for increased physical activity are needed. Objective: To determine the effect on cardiovascular health of email-based <b>encouragements</b> <b>to</b> do daily stair-walks at work together with colleagues among adults in sedentary occupations. Methods: A single-blind randomized controlled trial was performed at a large administrative company in Copenhagen, Denmark. Participants were 160 office workers (125 women, 35 men; mean age 42 years, SD 10; sitting 89. 5 % of work time). At baseline, aerobic fitness was 37 mL/min/kg (SD 9), mean blood pressure was 118 / 79 mmHg (SD 14 / 9), and mean body mass index (BMI) was 23 kg/m 2 (SD 4). Participants were randomly assigned (2 : 1 ratio) to an email group receiving weekly email-based <b>encouragements</b> <b>to</b> walk the stairs for 10 minutes a day or to a control group receiving weekly reminders to continue their usual physical activities. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to 10 -week follow-up in aerobic fitness determined from a maximal cycle test. The examiner was blinded to group allocation. Results: Adherence <b>to</b> the email <b>encouragements</b> was fairly high with 82. 7 % of the participants performing at least 3 sessions of 10 -minute stair-walks per week (mean 3. 3, SD 1. 3). Mean heart rate reached 167 beats/min (SD 10) during stair-walks. In the intention-to-treat analysis, aerobic fitness increased 1. 45 mL/min/kg (95 % CI 0. 64 - 2. 27) at 10 -week follow-up in the email group compared with the control group. In participants with low aerobic fitness at baseline (n= 56), aerobic fitness increased 1. 89 mL/min/kg (95 % CI 0. 53 - 3. 24), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased 4. 81 mmHg (95 % CI 0. 47 - 9. 16) and 2. 67 mmHg (95 % CI 0. 01 - 5. 32), respectively, in the email group compared with the control group. Body weight decreased in the email group of those with low aerobic fitness compared with the control group, {{but this was not}} statistically significant. Conclusions: Simple and inexpensive email-based <b>encouragements</b> <b>to</b> do daily stair-walks together with colleagues at work improves cardiovascular health among adults in sedentary occupations. There exists an enormous potential to prevent {{the hazardous}} health effects of a sedentary lifestyle through the use of email-based <b>encouragements</b> <b>to</b> do short bouts of physical activity at the workplace...|$|R
