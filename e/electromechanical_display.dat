Dubbed a Solari board after its Italian manufacturer, it contained rows of flip panels that displayed train information, and became a New York institution, as its many displays would flap simultaneously to reflect changes in train schedules, an indicator of just how busy Grand Central was.

50|$|Traditional (<b>electromechanical)</b> <b>displays</b> are {{equipped}} with synchro mechanisms that transmit the pitch, roll, and heading shown on the captain and first officer's instruments to an instrument comparator. The comparator warns of excessive differences between the Captain and First Officer displays. Even a fault as far downstream as a jam in, say, the roll mechanism of an ADI triggers a comparator warning. The instrument comparator thus provides both comparator monitoring and display monitoring.|$|R

Aircraft were getting progressively more displays, dials and information dashboards that eventually competed for space and pilot attention. In the 1970s, the average aircraft had more than 100 cockpit instruments and controls.|$|R

40|$|Aircraft flight station designs have {{generally}} evolved through {{the incorporation of}} improved or modernized controls and displays. In connection with a continuing increase {{in the amount of}} information displayed, this process has produced a complex and cluttered conglomeration of knobs, switches, and <b>electromechanical</b> <b>displays.</b> The result was often high crew workload, missed signals, and misinterpreted information. Advances in electronic technology have now, however, led to new concepts in flight station design. An American aerospace company in cooperation with NASA has utilized these concepts to develop a candidate conceptual design for a 1995 flight station. The obtained Pilot's Desk Flight Station is a unique design which resembles more an operator's console than today's cockpit. Attention is given to configuration, primary flight controllers, front panel displays, flight/navigation display, approach charts and weather display, head-up display, and voice command and response systems...|$|R

It uses the Moon tactile alphabet which is a standard alternative to the better known Braille alphabet in which letters consist of embossed lines, rather than dots. It {{is considered to be}} easier for elderly blind people to learn but the uptake has been severely hindered by the lack of a computer display method, other than printing or embossing it onto paper, whereas many <b>electromechanical</b> Braille <b>displays</b> are available.

Electromagnetic devices, using a solenoid coil {{to control a}} visible flag or flap, were the earliest type, and were used for text displays such as stock market prices and arrival/departure display times. The cathode ray tube was the workhorse of text and video display technology for several decades until being displaced by plasma, liquid crystal (LCD) and solid-state devices such as LEDs and OLEDs. With the advent of microprocessors and microelectronic devices, many more individual picture elements ("pixels") could be incorporated into one display device, allowing graphic displays and video.|$|R
25|$|The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) {{signed a}} 280-year lease in 1994 {{and began a}} massive restoration, in which all billboards were removed and the station was restored.

The original baggage room, later converted into retail space and occupied for many years by Chemical Bank, was removed, and replaced with a mirror image of the West Stairs. Although the baggage room had been designed by the original architects, the restoration architects found evidence that a set of stairs mirroring those to the West was originally intended for that space. Other modifications included a complete overhaul of the Terminal's superstructure and the replacement of the electromechanical Omega Board train arrival/departure display with a purely electronic display that was designed to fit into the architecture of the Terminal aesthetically.

40|$|International audienceOptimal {{properties}} like piezoelectricity can {{be found}} in polarizable materials for which the structure changes sharply under small composition variations in the vicinity of their morphotropic phase boundary or the triple point in their isobaric temperature-composition phase diagram. In the latter, lead-free (Ba 0. 850 Ca 0. 150) (Ti 0. 900 Zr 0. 100) O 3 ceramics exhibit outstanding piezoelectric coefficients. For the first time, we report the growth of piezoelectric lead-free single crystals in the BaTiO 3 -BaZrO 3 -CaTiO 3 pseudo-ternary system. The stoichiometry control in the CaO-BaO-TiO 2 -ZrO 2 solid solution led to single crystals with various compositions ranging from (Ba 0. 857 Ca 0. 143) (Ti 0. 928 Zr 0. 072) O 3 to (Ba 0. 953 Ca 0. 047) (Ti 0. 427 Zr 0. 573) O 3. We evidenced a continuous cross-over from a ferroelectric state at high titanium content to a relaxor one on increasing the zirconium content. Such a property tuning is rather seldom observed in lead-free ferroelectrics and confirms what was already reported for ceramics.

40|$|Ionic polymer {{transducers}} are {{devices that}} <b>display</b> <b>electromechanical</b> transduction and {{are projected to}} have extensive applications as actuators and sensors. This study employs novel, highly branched sulfonated polysulfones (sBPS) {{as part of an}} investigation into the contribution of polymer topology to electromechanical transduction. Specifically, the ionomers are combined with an ionic liquid to determine the optimal ratio and method for maximizing ionic conductivity, where charge transport is essential to device performance. Two uptake methods are assessed for introduction of ionic liquid into the central ionomeric membrane. The effects of casting membranes in the presence of ionic liquid and swelling preformed membranes in ionic liquid on film stability and ionic conductivity are examined. Membranes cast from a solution of the ionomer and ionic liquid allow for direct targeting of the component ratio and a single-step process for membrane formation. Swelling conditions for preformed neat membranes combine time, temperature, and the presence of organic co-diluents to achieve the maximum stable uptake of ionic liquid. Comparison of optimal conditions for the various methods reveals that swelling with co-diluents achieves ionic conductivity of the imbibed membrane per uptake higher than the levels achieved with the casting process for highly sulfonated sBPS. However, for less sulfonated sBPS the casting process successfully produced membranes with ionic conductivities unreachable with the co-diluent process. Both methods will enable the production of high performance ionic polymer transducers constructed from novel sBPS ionomers and ionic liquids. PublishedN/...|$|R
