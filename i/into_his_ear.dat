25|$|On 23 October 2016, while Mourinho's Manchester United was {{trailing}} 4–0 against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea manager Antonio Conte waved up {{the home}} crowd, {{urging them to}} make more noise to support the team. At {{the end of the}} match, Mourinho shook Conte's hand and whispered <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear,</b> with media reports claiming Mourinho had accused Conte of trying to humiliate United with his actions. Both managers refused to confirm or deny the report, but Conte refuted claims {{that he was trying to}} antagonise Mourinho. Chelsea midfielder Pedro supported Conte, claiming Mourinho's reaction was out of context.|$|E

The Snow Queen knows that Gold wants to leave Storybrooke with Belle and to be free of the Dagger of Kris, while the Snow Queen wants Storybrooke all to herself, and she says that she has the secret to the missing ingredient he needs. She then asks for the ribbons, and as he gives them to her, the Snow Queen whispers the secret <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear.</b> Then, Mr. Gold says that he will obtain the final ingredient with great pleasure, causing the Snow Queen to stare at him with a shocked expression.|$|E
25|$|While Sykes and Haytham {{watch the}} {{entrance}} to the complex, al-Ghazi, Fleury, and Mayes follow a blood trail and kill many gunmen inside. Mayes, separated from the others, finds Leavitt and his attackers, preparing an execution video of Leavitt. She kills the remaining insurgents, and al-Ghazi and the team start to leave. Fleury then realizes there is a trail of blood leading {{to the back of the}} apartment, and al-Ghazi sees the grandfather and inspects his hand. When the old man gives him his hand, al-Ghazi sees that the man is missing the same fingers as Abu Hamza al-Masri in the terrorist group's many videos and confirms his suspicion that the grandfather is the terrorist leader. Abu Hamza's teenage grandson walks out of the bedroom and shoots al-Ghazi in the neck, then he starts to point his gun at Mayes, prompting Fleury to kill him. Abu Hamza then pulls out an assault rifle and Haytham kills him. As Abu Hamza dies, another grandchild hugs him and Abu Hamza whispers something <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear</b> to calm the child down. Al-Ghazi dies in Fleury's arms.|$|E

500|$|By {{the final}} week of the campaign, McGovern {{knew he was going}} to lose. While he was {{appearing}} in Battle Creek, Michigan, on November 2, a Nixon admirer heckled him. McGovern told the heckler, [...] "I've got a secret for you," [...] then said softly <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear,</b> [...] "Kiss my ass."

500|$|Escaping with Luthor in the helicopter, a disillusioned Kitty {{discards}} {{the remaining}} crystals {{and the two}} eventually end up on a deserted island when they run out of fuel. Complications from kryptonite exposure cause Superman to fall into a coma, and while doctors are able to remove more fragments from his skin, they cannot revive him. Lois visits {{him in the hospital}} and whispers <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear</b> while glancing at Jason. Soon after, hospital staff discover his room empty. No longer feeling alone in the universe, Superman visits his newly revealed son in the boy's room and repeats to Jason the words of his own father as he sleeps.

2500|$|It {{has never}} been proven who {{actually}} fired the final shot <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear,</b> or determined whether this shot was made during the gunfight {{or as part of}} a possible execution, with wide speculation remaining regarding the subject. Some of Escobar's relatives believe that he had committed suicide. His two brothers, Roberto Escobar and Fernando Sánchez Arellano, believe that he shot himself through the ear. In a statement regarding the topic, the duo would state that Pablo [...] "had committed suicide, he did not get killed. During all the years they went after him, he would say to me every day that if he was really cornered without a way out, he would 'shoot himself through the ear'." ...|$|E

[...] "Think a moment," [...] they said. [...] "If we were to die, people would not replace anything, or improve on their tools. By causing things to wear out, we lead people to invent new things.

2500|$|One sketch {{featured}} {{an employee}} (McCulloch) at a counter who loans a customer (McDonald) his ballpoint. After conducting his business, the customer absentmindedly pockets {{the pen and}} walks off. The employee sets off in a mad pursuit, all the while screaming [...] "MY PEN!" [...] The employee chases the customer outside, {{in time to see}} him climbing into a taxi. He has horrific fantasies of the customer sticking the pen <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear,</b> using it to stab a bystander, and reinserting the bloody pen into his own ear. The employee chases the taxi down the street and, leaping through the air, lands on the vehicle, holding onto the passenger side door with his finger tips. After a drive around town, the taxi pulls over, the customer issues a cursory apology before returning the pen, after which the employee curls up with it in the street, and some of his co-workers come out with a comfort blanket to collect him. The sketch ends with another customer asking for the pen, only for the audience to see that the employee now wears a large, weighty helmet with a chinstrap and a chain attached at the forehead, the other end of which secures the pen. [...] This short film, as well as many other The Kids in the Hall shorts, was directed by Michael Kennedy.|$|E
2500|$|The Irregulars in the laneway {{opened fire}} with rifles on the convoy. Emmet Dalton ordered {{the driver of}} the touring car to 'drive like hell', but Collins said 'no, stop and we'll fight 'em' and jumped from the vehicle along with the others. Collins first took cover behind the low grass bank {{bordering}} the road but then jumped up and ran back along the road to begin firing with his Lee Enfield rifle from behind the armoured car. The Vickers machine gun in that car had also been firing at the attackers but then stopped because a badly-loaded ammunition belt caused it to jam. Apparently {{to get a better view}} of the laneway, Collins foolishly left the protection of the armoured car and moved even further back along the road. Now standing in the open, he fired a couple of shots and as he was once more working the bolt of his rifle he was shot in the head. He was the only fatality, although another member of his party suffered a neck wound. At this stage, the firing abated and the Irregulars moved away. Collins was found, face down, on the roadway. One of his men whispered an Act of Contrition <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear,</b> but Collins was clearly dead. He was lifted into the back of the touring car with his head resting against the shoulder of Emmet Dalton. The convoy ...|$|E

60|$|Sir Robert {{himself had}} urgent need {{of change and}} rest. The {{responsibility}} upon his shoulders had been tremendous.
