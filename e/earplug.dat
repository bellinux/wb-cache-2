25|$|Hand-modeled clay female figurines {{are also}} highly {{characteristic}} of Las Charcas culture. Those found at Kaminaljuyu are generally of reddish brown clay {{and some have}} a white slip. The female figurines often depict pregnancy and {{are thought to have}} been offerings to promote fertility in the fields. Usually the arms and legs of the figures are mere stumps but some attempt at a realistic body shape has been made. The head has received the most attention to detail. The nose was pinched into the relief and nostrils were made by punctuating the clay. The eyes and the mouth were formed by strategically applied lumps. The figurines often have <b>earplug</b> flares.|$|E
25|$|Passive noise {{isolation}} is essentially using {{the body of}} the earphone, either over or in the ear, as a passive <b>earplug</b> that simply blocks out sound. The headphone types that provide most attenuation are in-ear canal headphones and closed-back headphones, both circumaural and supra aural. Open-back and earbud headphones provide some passive noise isolation, but much less than the others. Typical closed-back headphones block 8 to 12dB, and in-ears anywhere from 10 to 15dB. Some models have been specifically designed for drummers, with the aim to be able to monitor the recorded sound while shutting out the sound coming directly from the drums {{at the same time as}} much as possible. Such headphones claim to reduce ambient noise by around 25dB.|$|E

50|$|When {{deciding}} between earmuffs and <b>earplugs,</b> it is {{also important}} to consider the noise reduction levels achieved at different sound frequencies. In general, earmuffs provide less attenuation for low-frequency (<500 Hz) sounds than <b>earplugs.</b> Thus, in situations where noise is dominated by low-frequency energy, <b>earplugs</b> are likely to be more effective. Earmuffs also fail to provide any noise reduction at infrasonic frequencies (< 20 Hz), which is energy that cannot be heard because it falls below the range of human hearing sensitivity. In contrast, <b>earplugs</b> can provide some attenuation to infrasonic sounds.|$|R
25|$|In Mound A {{the tomb}} is {{associated}} with a pit burial. All that remains in the pit burial of its original fill are worn igneous rocks, quantities of coarse sherds and human skull parts that had been cut through by the digging of the tomb. The tomb contains the remains of eight people. One corpse received special treatment, as evinced by the considerable amount of jewelry and the offerings left with it. The bodies were borne into the tomb on fabric mats or animal hides of which only traces remain. Among the objects found as offerings in the tomb were jade beads around the necks of two of the corpses, wafer-like disc shells forming a choker on one skeleton, jade <b>earplug</b> flares, an unusually large number of shells, a fine obsidian blade, a tortoise shell, metates, and various fine pottery pieces including a whistling jar and a carved tripod vessel. Several coarse brownware vessels heaped {{against the wall of the}} tomb probably originally contained food prepared for the after-life journey of the dead.|$|E

2500|$|On January 23, 1974, {{five days}} before their second fight, Ali and Frazier had a public altercation {{captured}} on television. ABC Sports's Howard Cosell had arranged for the two {{to come to the}} studio to comment on their first fight. Things went smoothly until Frazier commented about Ali having to visit a hospital after the fight. Ali immediately responded by claiming he had gone to a hospital for ten minutes whereas Frazier had been hospitalized for three weeks after the fight, and concluded by calling Frazier [...] "ignorant." [...] Frazier then snapped; removing his studio <b>earplug,</b> Frazier reached across to Ali protesting the usage of the word [...] "ignorant". Soon the two were wrestling on the floor till they were separated by onlookers.|$|E

50|$|Rock concerts {{are often}} {{performed}} {{at very high}} decibel levels. Prolonged exposure to noise at these levels can permanently damage {{the bones of the}} middle ear and the nerves of the inner ear. Thus health officials recommend that concertgoers use <b>earplugs.</b> Since the 1960s, many musicians have worn <b>earplugs</b> at concerts, and some concert promoters actually give out free <b>earplugs.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Earplugs</b> {{are also}} a {{possible}} cause of ear inflammation (otitis externa), although the short-term use of <b>earplugs</b> when swimming and shampooing hair may actually help prevent it. Still, many pathogenic bacteria grow well on warm, moist, foam-type plugs (polyvinylchloride (PVC) or polyurethane). However, there need also be a loss of integrity of the skin for infection to occur. Hard and poorly fitting <b>earplugs</b> can scratch {{the skin of the}} ear canal and set off an episode. When <b>earplugs</b> are used during an acute episode, disposable plugs are recommended, or used plugs must be cleaned and dried properly to avoid contaminating the healing ear canal with infected discharge.|$|R

50|$|<b>Earplugs</b> for {{sleeping}} {{are made to}} be as comfortable as possible while blocking external sounds that may prevent or disrupt sleep. Specialized <b>earplugs</b> for such noises as a partner's snoring may have sound-dampening enhancements that enable the user to still hear other noises, such as an alarm clock.|$|R
50|$|Personal noise {{reduction}} devices can be passive, active or a combination. Passive ear protection includes <b>earplugs</b> or earmuffs which can block noise up {{to a specific}} frequency. <b>Earplugs</b> and earmuffs can provide the wearer with 10 dB to 40 dB of attenuation. However, use of <b>earplugs</b> is only effective if the users have been educated and use them properly; without proper use, protection falls far below manufacturer ratings. Higher consistency of performance has been found with custom-molded <b>earplugs.</b> Because of their ease of use without education, and ease of application or removal, earmuffs have more consistency with both compliance and noise attenuation. Active ear protection (electronic pass-through hearing protection devices or EPHPs) electronically filter out noises of specific frequencies or decibels while allowing the remaining noise to pass through.|$|R
50|$|NIOSH Mining Safety and Health Research {{recommends}} {{using the}} roll, pull, and hold method when using memory foam earplugs. The process involves the user rolling the <b>earplug</b> into a thin rod, pulling {{back on the}} ear, and holding the <b>earplug</b> deep in the canal with the finger. To get a complete seal, the user must wait about 20 to 30 seconds for the <b>earplug</b> to expand inside the canal.|$|E
50|$|The <b>earplug</b> is a 4 segment type. This {{is rarely}} {{available}} as a third part product that consumers can buy. This can be found sold by third parties and if the user is inventive, they can make an adapter to allow a line-in to car stereos and home stereos. The <b>earplug</b> connection is also used as an antenna for the built-in FM Radio, however, when the <b>earplug</b> connection is in use, the Bluetooth earpiece function is disabled.|$|E

40|$|Background: The aim of {{the study}} was to answer the {{question}} of whether <b>earplugs</b> provide sufficient protection in the exposure to impulse noise generated during metalworking processes. Material and Methods: The noise generated by die forging hammer and punching machine was characterized. Using an acoustic test fixture, noise parameters (LCpeak, LAmax) under 24 <b>earplugs,</b> foam, winged and no-roll, were measured. Octave band method was used to calculate values of LAeq under <b>earplugs.</b> Results: It was found that in the case of punching machine the exposure limit value of A-weighted noise exposure level, normalized to an 8 -h working day (LEX, 8 h = 94. 8 dB) of noise present at the workstation, was exceeded, while in the case of die forging hammer both the exposure limit value of this parameter (LEX, 8 h = 108. 3 dB) and the exposure limit value of peak sound pressure level (LCpeak = 148. 9 dB) were exceeded. The assessment of noise parameters (LCpeak, LAmax, LAeq) under <b>earplugs</b> revealed that the noise attenuation can be insufficient, sufficient, or too high. Conclusions: <b>Earplugs</b> can be suitable hearing protection devices in metalworking processes. Of the 24 <b>earplugs</b> included in this study, 9 provided appropriate noise attenuation in the case of tested die forging hammer and 10 in the case of tested punching machine.

50|$|Pressure {{and flight}} <b>earplug</b> molds are less common, {{as they are}} {{typically}} not used as long as other earplugs, and are therefore less in demand.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} noise {{reduction}} from dual hearing protection is NOT a {{sum of the}} noise reductions ratings from the two devices. For example, if wearing an <b>earplug</b> with a NRR of 25 dB and an earmuff with an NRR of 20 dB, the combined protection would not be 45 dB. Instead, 5 dB should {{be added to the}} higher of the two NRRs. In the preceding example, the combined earmuff and <b>earplug</b> NRR would be estimated at 30 dB (25 dB plus 5).|$|E

50|$|Furthermore, {{they may}} be either {{disposable}} or reusable, with foam and hand rolled silicone ones generally being disposable or for use a relatively limited number of times. Custom molded are non-disposable and made from either acrylic, vinyl, or silicone materials. Custom molded come as either vented (for communication) or non-vented (for high noise). A variation of the traditional foam <b>earplug</b> is the no-roll foam <b>earplug</b> that uses a built-in central stem to push the foam plugs into the ears. These earplugs achieve a seal due to their tapered shape, rather than expansion after being rolled.|$|E

50|$|If pushed too {{far into}} the ear canal, they may push earwax and debris into the canal and {{possibly}} against the ear drum. As a precaution, <b>earplugs</b> should not be pushed further into the ear canal than they may be grabbed and rotated. Earwax impacted by <b>earplugs</b> can be removed by irrigation or other remedies, as described here.|$|R
40|$|Context: Damage to the {{auditory}} system by loud sounds {{can be avoided}} by hearing protection devices (HPDs) such as earmuffs, <b>earplugs,</b> or both for maximum attenuation. However, the attenuation can be limited by air conduction (AC) leakage around the <b>earplugs</b> and earmuffs by the occlusion effect (OE) and by skull vibrations initiating bone conduction (BC). Aims: To assess maximum attenuation by HPDs and possible flanking pathways to the inner ear. Subjects and Methods: AC attenuation and resulting thresholds were assessed using the real ear attenuation at threshold (REAT) procedure on 15 normal-hearing participants in four free-field conditions: (a) unprotected ears, (b) ears covered with earmuffs, (c) ears blocked with deeply inserted customized <b>earplugs,</b> and (d) ears blocked with both <b>earplugs</b> and earmuffs. BC thresholds were assessed with and without <b>earplugs</b> to assess the OE. Results: Addition of earmuffs to <b>earplugs</b> did not cause significantly greater attenuation than <b>earplugs</b> alone, confirming minimal AC leakage through the external meatus {{and the absence of}} the OE. Maximum REATs ranged between 40 and 46 [*]dB, leading to thresholds of 46 – 54 [*]dB HL. Furthermore, calculation of the acoustic impedance mismatch between air and bone predicted at least 60 [*]dB attenuation of BC. Conclusion: Results do not support the notion that skull vibrations (BC) contributed to the limited attenuation provided by traditional HPDs. An alternative explanation, supported by experimental evidence, suggests transmission of sound to inner ear via non-osseous pathways such as skin, soft tissues, and fluid. Because the acoustic impedance mismatch between air and soft tissues is smaller than that between air and bone, air-borne sounds would be transmitted to soft tissues more effectively than to bone, and therefore less attenuation is expected through soft tissue sound conduction. This can contribute to the limited attenuation provided by traditional HPDs. The present study has practical implications for hearing conservation protocols...|$|R
