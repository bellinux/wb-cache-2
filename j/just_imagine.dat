He becomes a superhero because he {{believes}} Earth's primitive technology is a result of humans squandering their resources fighting crime, corruption, and other ills, and that alleviating these problems will allow humanity to advance to the point of creating a means to send him home. He has superhuman strength and speed, and wears a flying harness. This version was created by Stan Lee and John Buscema.|$|E

So the novel does not <b>just</b> present <b>imagined</b> events, it also presents {{a point of view}} on them, a perspective constituted in part by actual feelings, emotions, and desires that the reader is prescribed to have toward the merely imagined events. Given that the notion of response covers such things as enjoyment and amusement, it is evident that some kinds of {{responses are}} actual, and not <b>just</b> <b>imagined.</b> I can criticize someone for taking pleasure in others 2 ̆ 7 pain, for being amused by sadistic cruelty, for being angry at someone when she has done no wrong, for desiring the bad.

Tony! Toni! Toné! used vintage recording equipment and, for certain tracks, a 40-piece orchestra. Some tracks featured guest musicians, including rapper and producer DJ Quik, percussionist SheilaE., and the Tower of Power horn section. Saadiq worked with DJ Quik on the song [...] "Let's Get Down" [...] and said the collaboration proved very [...] "natural" [...] because of the producer's affinity for funk music. Tony! Toni!

500|$|Malley's stay {{increasingly}} involved him in {{the fighting}} in China; his wife would relate three years of night-time air raids to her friends upon the couple's return to Australia in 1940. In May 1938, he advised the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice-Marshal Richard Williams: [...] "there is a first-class war on here, which must eventually affect Australia and its defence schemes". Williams {{and other members of}} the RAAF may, however, have perceived Malley as exaggerating the importance of his role in China, particularly given his apparent delight in its ceremonial aspects. In one letter, he regaled Williams with stories of an inspection tour around the country, declaring: [...] "I... can <b>just</b> <b>imagine</b> how much you would have enjoyed it– landing on aerodromes that were all polished up for inspection. Being met by provincial dignitaries and lavishly entertained. I had to drink every conceivable Chinese wine that was ever made, and to eat foods unheard of in Australia!"

[...] They called Ray [...] "eye candy" [...] for Kat, saying [...] "it's never a bad thing" [...] for her, and noted that she appreciates him as her head chef. For Kat to have an affair with Ray would not only mean betraying Alfie but also Kim. They felt that Ray was the most obvious choice, and had not yet had a major storyline, and an affair would shock viewers and have a big impact on Ray's family life. They also said that they would not blame Kat for an affair with Ray as he is [...] "gorgeous, sensitive and has a six-pack to die for". Soaplife opined that Ray was the [...] "red herring", as actor Venn has said he would like Ray to marry Kim and start a family, and later said that all hints were pointing to Ray, so [...] "it would be no kind of mystery if it is him." [...] All About Soap said that Ray's [...] "flirty banter with Kat has sent her into a spin", but were not sure Ray would be the one having the affair, especially after Kat picks Alfie for the football team over Ray, and made him joint third most likely, along with Derek. The magazine later opined that [...] "lovely" [...] Ray would not have it in him to cheat, but thought he may have tired of Kim's behaviour. Empson told Inside Soap that she was unsure if Kat would cheat on Ray as Kim is her best friend, while Venn said that [...] "Kat's a saucy minx, and what man wouldn't want to get involved with her? Ray is a loyal, caring father, but we all have our dark sides. There's a lot the audience hasn't seen yet, put it that way..."

2500|$|The 14th century saw {{a wave of}} {{travelers}} who left records of their travels. [...] In 1323 the Anglo-Irish friar Simon Fitzsimon (Symon Semeonis) visited the area with his friend Hugh (who died in Cairo) and observed [...] "the granaries (...) of Joseph mentioned in Genesis. [...] They are three in number, of which two are of such size and height that at a distance they look more like the summits of mountains than repositories of corn." [...] In 1349 the Tuscan monk Niccolò Poggibonsi noted that [...] "three miles outside Babylon there are granaries, which are called Pharaoh's granaries. [...] Joseph, the son of Jacob, had them built." [...] He continues: [...] "three are outside Babylon, which are so big that coming from Alexandria they can be seen 60 miles away. [...] The said seven granaries are diamond shaped and within is a large house, above and below of porphyry; and within there is a deep pit. [...] And many a time we threw in stones and did not hear them strike the bottom and it looked very dark, and we left at once through fear, having our little torch quenched from the wind, which came from there." [...] The year 1374 saw thirteen Tuscan travelers make the pilgrimage to the Holy Land, three of which left accounts: Leonardo Frescobaldi, Simone Sigoli, and Giorgio Gucci. [...] Frescobaldi makes a brief mention of [...] "the granaries which Joseph had made {{at the time of}} Pharaoh king of Egypt, {{in the days of the}} famine." [...] Sigoli offers a fuller and more literary account, noting that [...] "Joseph found means to have from every side as much corn as he could, and quickly he collected a very great number of bushels, and this grain he put in these granaries. [...] And they are among the biggest edifices to be seen: and they are three and distant one from another a stones throw; and they are built of very great long thick stones and in shape like a diamond; the base is very wide and the summit pointed ... and each has four sides, and the corn was placed inside: <b>just</b> <b>imagine</b> the very great amount amount that inside would take." [...] Gucci appears to have reflected a bit more on what he saw: [...] "These granaries, which are of giant structure, are said to have been made by Pharaoh at the time of the great famine at the time of Joseph, though to see them they appear to be works for perpetual memory rather than granaries. [...] In 1392 Thomas Brygg, an Englishman who later became mayor of Bordeaux, noted the [...] "famous granaries of wondrous size which Joseph, the son of Jacob, had built in the days of Pharaoh." [...] In 1395 the French lord Ogier d'Anglure described the challenges of getting to the foot of the Pyramids and the commotion of workers stripping the smooth facing: [...] "the great stones falling like so many vine plants that these masons were chopping down." [...] "It should be explained," [...] he continues, [...] "that these granaries are called Pharaoh's Granaries; and the pharaoh had them built in the time when Joseph, the son of Jacob, was governor over all the kingdom of Egypt ... As for describing the inside of these granaries, we could hardly speak of it, since the entrance from above is walled up and there are enormous tombs in front of it ... the entrances were closed up because people had been using the places to make counterfeit money." ...|$|E
