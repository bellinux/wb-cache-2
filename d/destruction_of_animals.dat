Firearms officers are authorised to fire upon a suspect if they pose an [...] "immediate threat to life", such as if an armed offender brandished a firearm at a member of the public or police officer. They may also fire if an offender is clearly in possession of a firearm, or is suspected to be carrying one. In all situations, a clear oral warning must be given of the officers intention to use firearms, unless in a particular situation it would be pointless or place life at risk. Firearms officers are also authorised to use their firearms for the humane <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals,</b> if the latter pose a significant threat.

All officers are trained to fire once at the central mass in order to incapacitate a threat, then to re-assess the situation and the threat posed to justify any further shots. However, if Operation Kratos contingency plans are activated, an armed officer may shoot at the target's head, to kill, as a standard incapacitating shot risks detonating a bomb attached to the person. In all situations, the officer is to make the decision when to shoot. However, they are accountable in court and are asked to justify their actions in a court of law.|$|E

There can be few more gripping sites of intersection between theology, literature, and animals than Flaubert’s ‘Legend of St Julian’.

I argue that Flaubert’s story of divine judgement for animal cruelty is distinct from the logic in which cruelty towards animals is judged to be problematic because of its causal relationship with intrahuman violence. In conclusion, I suggest that the text provides an illuminating lens for engaging with the pressing ethical question of the mass killing of non-human animals for human food...|$|E

40|$|Small farm systems {{combining}} {{crop and}} animals are the important categories especially in Bangladesh. The value of crop-animal systems lies in their positive contribution to sustainability and economic growth. A central {{goal of the}} small farm is to generate a minimum target income and a sus-tainable system. These types of small scale farming are widely practiced in South East Asia and East Asia as for example China, Indonesia, Vietnam, where animal production is integrated with fish farming and vegetable production. Increasing population pressure in Bangladesh results in progressively smaller agricultural holdings and traditional grazing areas are taken over for crop production. The production systems in Bangladesh are characterized with small litter size or flocks, no or minimal inputs, low out-puts and periodic <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> by disease. Typically the litter size or flocks are small in num-ber with each household containing 2 - 3 cattle and 7 - 10 poultry.

Under the prevailing situation in Bangladesh like other developing countries, the introduc-tion of more productive integrated intensive farming systems is imperative. Maximum sustainable pro-ductivity can only be achieved by integrating intensive livestock and poultry keeping with crop produc-tion and agroforestry.

40|$|This book is {{the story}} of my journey with Emmanuel Levinas on a dystopic path to the ethical {{encounter}}. For the journey, I agree to be Levinas’s human subject, to encounter his “other”. And he agrees to traverse a path through my world, a world of food and eating. To ready me for the encounter, Levinas tells me the story of his ethics, narratively (we ‘journey’ through it), and so my book is unavoidably ‘story’ too. To preface, then: The ethical encounter is a “face to face” encounter between a “human” subject (me) and an “other” (TI: 39). In my encountering the other face to face in the world of food, food production and eating, Levinas {{tells the story of the}} violences of my existence—of my ‘eating’ of the world at the expense of the other. Face to face with the other, I cannot avoid my responsibility for the needs and suffering of the other. In “proximity” with the other, I am guilty for eating; in proximity, I respond by giving the other “bread from [my] mouth” (OB: 100). In the first four chapters of the journey, I am hungry, and Levinas leads me through scenes replete with food and eating. Some of these scenes Levinas had intended to show me, and some he did not; some scenes I show him (I have, after all, asked him into my world). At first, he shows me how this world can satiate my needs, but how it will, inevitably and inextricably, leave me, a not-yet ethical human subject, vulnerable and exposed. So Levinas and I enter scenes that help me avoid exposure: Industrialised production and <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> for food and its sequelae of familiar and dependable home-cooked meals, both temporally and temporarily, secure me from feeling anxious in the world. But, with security, my enjoyment loses its exciting edge. In chapters five and six, Levinas takes me to the space where the ethical encounter is meant to take place; and he has readied me through vivid story to feel guilty—I am ready now to give the bread from my mouth to the other. But there is no other here for me to encounter. I confront Levinas; I ask him to think beyond the security of his own ethical space. I suggest that perhaps the spatial strategies he has shown me to avoid the threats of the world have now all but voided that world itself—voided the possibility of my encountering (any) other(s). It is here that I leave Levinas, in the silence he offered me in reply, and I walk alone into the final two chapters. I argue (with whom, for there are no others?) that, perhaps, the world around me is a hyper-secured space that refuses to regard the boundaries that Levinas sets upon it. I argue that this space has been voided of responsibility, and I ask: What are the consequences? This final question draws me back (albeit facing in a different direction from that in which I began), to eating. I suggest that all Levinas and I have been through on this journey—avoiding the consequences of my eating the world, avoiding my guilt and responsibility, avoiding a world voided of guilt and responsibility—all this can be avoided: We can avoid avoidance, and eat it too. And what will this mean? To the thesis, then...|$|E

The thesis presents the interrelated results of research of radiofrequency thermal <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> myocardium in experiments, analysis of parameters of electrical current and thermoelectric characteristics of human miocardium during clinical procedures of catheter radiofrequency ablation of cardiac arrhythmogenic zones and mathematical modeling of biophysical mechanisms of highfrequency electrical exposure on the biological tissue. In the process of doing the research the latest specialized high-tech medical equipment for objective diagnosis of arrhythmogenic zones in the heart, standardized criteria control the efficiency of extraction of sources of arrhythmia, certified and metrologically entrusted technical tools of RFA were used. For the first time, regularities of the thermal effect of the radiofrequency current of different power ranges on the areas of the myocardium were established, which allowed to determine the thermal resistance of the myocardium tissue, the degree of heat loss in the around the electrode zone and the parameters of heat transfer, and to scientifically substantiate the prognostic criteria of the efficiency and safety of ablation of arrhythmogenic sources in different anatomical zones of the heart. Adaptive method of calculating the thermoelectric characteristics of myocardium (specific electrical conductivity, specific heat capacity, thermal conductivity coefficient, heat transfer coefficient, degree of capillary perfusion, linear velocity of blood in the electrode space) was developed based on analysis of individual electrical and thermal parameters of response of heart tissue to the exposure of radiofrequency current by the solution of inverse problem of thermodynamics. It allows to calculate the specified values for each patient?s myocardium during the procedure of the catheter RFA in the operating room. For the first time there were determined the thermoelectric characteristics of five anatomical heart areas, in which standard RFA is perfomed. The obtained characteristics were put into the development of mathematical model of catheter radiofrequency ablation to reproduce the three-dimensional graphic image of the distribution of the thermal field in the thickness of the myocardium in different areas of the heart with regard to their morphometric properties. The model is implemented in clinical practice as a tool for the visualization of the depth of myocardium destruction and predicting effective eliminate the source of arrhythmia and perforating complications based on thermogenesis. The accuracy of the model has been tested and confirmed by an independent determination of the RF destruction of myocardial tissue in images obtained by magnetic resonance imaging. Absolute errors of the model were: for the depth of destruction ? 0, 8 mm, for the electrode temperature ? 1, 22 ?C. Method of catheter RFA of cardiac arrhythmogenic zones was obtained further development by the due to the use of electrical effects from two catheter electrodes. The effective technique of catheter bipolar RFA of pathological sources in abnormally thickened wall of the heart was developed. By the application of an electric exposure from two electrodes located in the heart during operation on different sides of myocardial tissue opposite each other, new method provides a doubling of the depth of destruction of a thick myocardial wall at the same power, safe values of temperature effects and shorter duration of exposure, that are not achieved with standard monopolar ablation. The clinical efficiency of the introduced method was confirmed by the complete elimination of the tachycardia in 25 patients out of 27 (93 %). The bipolar catheter RFA initiated a new technique for performing endo-epicardial ablation and reduction of intraventricular septum in patients with cardiomyopathies. Based on the simulation results of thermoelectric processes and improving the method of RFA, practical recomendations and algorithms of choosing parameters of radiofrequency ablation (sizes of electrodes, ranges of output power, monitored electrode temperature which are controlled, time of application) for different anatomical areas of the heart were developed. They allow to perform effective and safe transmural destruction of arrhythmogenic tissue of the myocardium. They were introduced in clinical practice of electrophysiology departments of six cardiac surgery centers of Ukraine, in which of 1623 procedures catheter ablation confirmed the efficiency of extraction of arrhythmias in 1615 patients (99, 5 %) without complications. ? ??????????????? ?????? ???????? ?????????? ???????????? ?? ????????? ????????????? ? ???????????? ?????????? ?????????????? ???????
