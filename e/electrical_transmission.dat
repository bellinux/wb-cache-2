5|$|Outside of Toamasina, Honorinina damaged {{roads and}} rail lines {{connecting}} {{the city with}} the capital, Antananarivo. Several other roads were damaged by landslides or washouts, and many bridges were damaged. The high winds damaged or destroyed thousands of homes along the storm's path, leaving 83,885people homeless. Many of the damaged homes lost their roofs, which resulted in additional damage when the heavy rainfall affected their interiors. The high winds also damaged many public buildings and factories along its path. The cyclone left widespread areas without water or power; the storm damaged <b>electrical</b> <b>transmission</b> and generation facilities. The high rainfall damaged dykes in Andromba and along the Ikopa and Sisaony rivers. Across the country, Honorinina killed 99people, and caused 424injuries. Damage totaled about $150million (1986USD).|$|E

5|$|Electrical {{power is}} usually {{generated}} by electro-mechanical generators driven by steam produced from fossil fuel combustion, or the heat released from nuclear reactions; or {{from other sources}} such as kinetic energy extracted from wind or flowing water. The modern steam turbine invented by Sir Charles Parsons in 1884 today generates about 80 percent of the electric {{power in the world}} using a variety of heat sources. Such generators bear no resemblance to Faraday's homopolar disc generator of 1831, but they still rely on his electromagnetic principle that a conductor linking a changing magnetic field induces a potential difference across its ends. The invention {{in the late nineteenth century}} of the transformer meant that electrical power could be transmitted more efficiently at a higher voltage but lower current. Efficient <b>electrical</b> <b>transmission</b> meant in turn that electricity could be generated at centralised power stations, where it benefited from economies of scale, and then be despatched relatively long distances to where it was needed.|$|E

25|$|Well {{aware of}} the dangers posed by German armor, Barnes was {{instrumental}} in getting the 90 mm gun in the M36 tank destroyer and getting them shipped to Europe over the opposition of the Army Ground Forces, which believed that the 75 and 76 mm guns were adequate. However, he did not approve {{of the idea of}} mounting a 90 mm in the Sherman; rather, he sought to develop a better tank. The T20 Medium Tank, developed in May 1942, was faster, with more armor and a lower silhouette than the Sherman. Further development work led to the T23, which incorporated an <b>electrical</b> <b>transmission.</b> The <b>electrical</b> <b>transmission</b> made the tank easier to operate, but at a cost in weight and maintenance, and was therefore rejected by the Army Ground Forces. He therefore reverted to conventional transmissions for the improved T25 and T26 models, mounting the 90 mm gun, which would eventually become the M26 Pershing.|$|E

In September–October 1943, a series of discussions occurred {{over the issue of}} beginning production of the T26E1, which was advocated by the head of the Armored Force, General Jacob Devers. Ordnance favored the 76mm gun, <b>electrical</b> <b>transmission</b> T23. Theater commanders generally favored a 76mm gun medium tank such as the T23, and were against a heavy 90mm gun tank. However, testing of the T23 at Fort Knox had demonstrated reliability problems in the <b>electrical</b> <b>transmission</b> of which most army commanders were unaware. The new 76mm M1A1 gun approved for the M4 Sherman seemed to address concerns about firepower against the German tanks. All participants in the debate were, however, unaware of the inadequacy of the 76mm gun against the frontal armor of the Panther tank, as they had not researched the effectiveness of this gun against the new German tanks, which had already been encountered in combat.|$|E
