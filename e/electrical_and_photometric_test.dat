40|$|Abstract: In recent years, {{fluorescent}} lamp dimming controls {{are an integral}} part of daylight artificial light integrated schemes intended for realization of energy savings. However, dimming, like any lighting option, presents its own particular challenges and potential tradeoffs. In view of this, the present manuscript depicts the preliminary work progress carried out to arrive at a comprehensive idea on dimming implications on key factors: electrical characteristics, photometric distributions of lighting systems and influence on quality as well as quantity of visual environment. The objective is to experimentally establish the acceptable range of dimming control voltage that would satisfy both <b>electrical</b> <b>and</b> <b>photometric</b> performance of luminaire. The vital part of the paper is devoted towards presentation of measurement results. For the experimental analysis, three representative samples of different commercial analog 1 - 10 VDC electronic dimmable ballasts and fluorescent fixtures are compared and evaluated over their control voltage dimming range...|$|R

Ceramic Metal Halide lamp is the latest improved version of metal halide lamp that finds its wide applications in indoor commercial lighting especially in retail shop lighting. This lamp shows better performance in terms of higher lumen per watt and colour constancy in comparison to conventional metal halide lamp. The inherent negative incremental impedance of CMH lamp demands the use of current control device in the lamp circuit and perfect matching of lamp ballast combination is required for efficient lamp operation. The <b>electrical</b> <b>and</b> <b>photometric</b> performance of two sets of commercial 70 watt CMH lamp and intregated ballast units were measured to investigate their compatibility for optimum lamp operation.

In this paper, standard test methods to determine the <b>electrical</b> <b>and</b> <b>photometric</b> performances of CFL were developed based on CIE 84 - 1989 and CIE 60901 - 1987, then 55 selected CFLs from market were tested.

50|$|Modern {{metrology}} has {{its roots}} in the French Revolution. With a political motivation to harmonise units throughout France, a length standard based on a natural source was proposed. In March 1791, the metre was defined. This led to the creation of the decimal-based metric system in 1795, establishing standards for other types of measurements. Several other countries adopted the metric system between 1795 and 1875; to ensure international conformity, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (Bureau International des Poids et Mesures, or BIPM) was established by the Metre Convention. Although the BIPM's original mission was to create international standards for units of measurement and relate them to national standards to ensure conformity, its scope has broadened to include <b>electrical</b> <b>and</b> <b>photometric</b> units <b>and</b> ionizing radiation measurement standards. The metric system was modernised in 1960 with the creation of the International System of Units (SI) as a result of a resolution at the 11th General Conference on Weights and Measures (Conference Generale des Poids et Mesures, or CGPM).|$|R
40|$|The {{extraordinary}} {{market growth}} of the high power halogen torchiere (halogen uplighter) presents significant global energy savings opportunities for energy efficient alternatives. Extensive developed of prototype designs of energy efficient torchiere systems using compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) has lead directly to the production and commercialization of CFL torchieres. This paper analyzes the current global market for torchieres <b>and</b> compares the <b>electrical</b> <b>and</b> <b>photometric</b> characteristics {{of one of the}} new CFL torchieres to standard tungsten halogen torchieres. Power assessments <b>and</b> <b>photometric</b> data indicate that the new CFL torchiere provides significant energy savings over the standard tungsten halogen torchiere while producing more luminous flux. The energy savings is jointly due to the high source efficacy of the CFLs and the poor performance of many cheaply made halogen lamps. Laboratory and in-situ experiments indicate that the CFL torchieres use 65 Watts to produce 25 % more light than the 300 W tungsten halogen torchieres they are designed to replace. Additionally, the CFL torchieres have the benefit of a cooler lamp operating temperature, making them safer luminaires (Brooks, 1997; New York Times, 1997). This safety benefit, coupled with the potential for significant reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, has prompted the insurance industry to form a unique alliance with energy conservation groups to promote energy efficient torchieres...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{design and}} {{implementation}} of power drives for light-emitting diode (LED) strings is investigated. We particularly focus on design methods for minimizing the size of output filter capacitor in flyback LED drivers. To this end, a novel constant power drive technique was developed to achieve better LED light regulation compared with the constant current technique. We present a filter capacitor minimization algorithm and applying it to an integrated buck-boost/flyback LED driver to achieve a long lasting LED driver. Minimization of the filter capacitor in an ac-dc flyback converter is investigated by utilizing a descent algorithm. The algorithm was proposed using a relationship between input current harmonics <b>and</b> LED <b>electrical</b> <b>and</b> <b>photometric</b> characteristics. The performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of filter capacitor minimization was experimentally verified to achieve input power factor correction along with meeting light flicker requirements. Furthermore, a primary-side constant power drive technique is proposed by utilizing a novel LED power estimation technique and an inner-outer-loop control structure. The proposed technique was implemented on an ac-dc flyback converter to attain simultaneous input power factor correction and LED light regulation. The enhanced performance of LED light regulation for the proposed technique is experimentally verified for different ambient temperatures and compared with the constant current drive method. The above filter capacitor minimization algorithm was utilized and experimentally tested in an ac-dc integrated buck-boost/flyback converter. Utilizing this algorithm, {{the size of the}} required filter capacitors can be significantly reduced...|$|R

The experimental data show that the subpopulations of animals with phenotypic combinations HbAB/HK and HbBB/HK are more productive than the subpopulations of animals with phenotypic combinations HbAB/LK and HbBB/LK.

40|$|Galaxy {{formation}} and evolution are {{an essential part}} of astronomy and cosmology today. To better understand the processes that are involved in the mechanism behind them it is necessary to study the physical processes in the observable universe at different epochs, which requires large astronomical surveys. In the case of the ALHAMBRA Survey, near infrared images (NIR) provide extra information that significantly increases the scientific value of the data, particularly for strongly-reddened elliptical galaxies, AGN or moderate-redshift starburst galaxies. The selection in the optical band F 814 W (used for ALHAMBRA’s original catalogue in Molino et al. (2014)) creates a bias against intrinsically red galaxies that begins to be noticeable at z 0. 8 and is dominant at z 1. 1 as already noticed by Arnalte-Mur et al. (2014). In this thesis we present a new ALHAMBRA (Advanced Large, Homogeneous Area Medium Band Redshift Astronomical) catalogue selected in the NIR Ks-band. This new data set allows to extend the studies performed using the optical catalogue to higher redshift. The catalogue includes photometry for 94, 182 sources distributed over seven fields and covering a total area of 2. 47 deg 2. We completed the catalogue with photometric redshifts computed using BPZ 2. 0 (Benitez 2000). We performed different tests to measure the accuracy of the photometry <b>and</b> the <b>photometric</b> redshifts. We also focused in this thesis on the measurement of the correlation function of red-type galaxies in the redshift range 0. 75 < z < 1. 45, extending the work performed in Hurtado-Gil et al. (2016). We used the same method described in Arnalte-Mur et al. (2014) to estimate the projected correlation function wp(rp). We have observed significant evolution of galaxy clustering in this redshift range and luminosity segregation at the highest redshift. In order to extend the photometry in the infrared wavelength range we cross-matched the ALHAMBRA Ks-selected catalogue with available Spitzer-IRAC public data and produced an additional ALHAMBRA-Ks+IRAC catalogue (AKs-IR). We included photometry in the ALHAMBRA Ks 20 + 3 filters, the synthetic F 814 W-band and the IRAC 3. 6, 4. 5 and 5. 8 μm channels. The catalogue contains 36, 024 sources in a total area of 0. 93 deg 2. We performed similar photometry <b>and</b> <b>photometric</b> <b>tests</b> as we had done with the Ks-band catalogue. In the final part of this thesis we have calculated the rest-frame Ks-band luminosity function (LF) using the data included in AKs-IR catalogue. We computed the LF using the method developed by López-Sanjuan et al. (2017). The comparison between our measurements and other similar works (Arnouts et al. 2005 a; Cirasuolo et al. 2010; Mortlock et al. 2017) shows good agreement, especially with Cirasuolo et al. (2010). Finally, we analysed the redshift evolution of the parameters MKs★, φKs★ and α, together with the integrated Ks-band luminosity density jk. We find strong positive number evolution, coupled with no apparent luminosity evolution in the red population; whereas the blue population shows slight positive number evolution coupled with negative luminosity evolution. This results in a global population change, where blue galaxies dominate the luminosity density at z 2, and red galaxies dominate at z 0. 5.

It {{was created in}} response to complaints received by utility program managers about the performance of certain Energy Star lighting products being promoted within their service territories {{and the lack of}} a self-policing mechanism within the lighting industry that would ensure the reliability of these products and their compliance with ENERGY STAR specifications. To remedy these problems, PEARL purchases and tests products that are available to the consumers in the marketplace. The Lighting Research Center (LRC) tests the selected products against the corresponding Energy Star specifications. This final report summarizes the experimental procedure and results of all cycles (Cycles 1 through 8) of PEARL program from the beginning of year 2000 to the end of 2007, along with the description of apparatus used, equipment calibration process, experimental methodology, and research findings from the testing. In each cycle of PEARL program, PEARL Board selects a list of Compact Fluorescent Lamp (CFL) and Residential Lighting Fixture (RLF) models that are Energy Star qualified. In Cycle 5, Cycle 7, and Cycle 8, no fixture models were selected. After that PEARL sponsors procure product samples for each selected model from different stores and locations in the retail market and send them to LRC for testing. LRC then receive and select the samples, and test them against Energy Star specifications. After the testing LRC analyze and report the results to PEARL Board. Totally 185 models of CFL and 52 models of RLF were tested in PEARL program. Along with the evolution of the Energy Star specifications from year 2000 to 2003, parameters that were required by Energy Star changed during the eight years of PEARL program. The testing parameters and number of samples tested in PEARL program also changed during this time. For example, in Cycle 1, three samples of each models were <b>tested</b> for their <b>photometric</b> <b>and</b> <b>electrical</b> parameters only; in Cycle 2, 1000 -hour Lumen Maintenance and the Rapid Cycle Stress Test was added and an additional set of six samples of each models were tested for Rapid Cycle Stress Test.

It is efficient in that it performs several computationally expensive calculations at a precomputation phase. Photometric transformations act {{on the value of}} the pixels. They account for effects such as lighting change. Jointly estimating geometric <b>and</b> <b>photometric</b> transformations is thus important for many tasks. such as image mosaicing. We propose an algorithm to jointly estimate groupwise geometric <b>and</b> <b>photometric</b> transformations while preserving the efficient precomputation-based design of the original inverse compositional algorithm. It is called the dual inverse compositional algorithm. It uses different approximations than the simultaneous inverse compositional algorithm and handles groupwise geometric <b>and</b> global <b>photometric</b> transformations. Its name {{stems from the fact that}} it uses an inverse compositional update rule for both the geometric <b>and</b> the <b>photometric</b> transformations. We demonstrate the proposed algorithm and compare it to previous ones on simulated and real data. This shows clear improvements in computational efficiency and in terms of convergence.
