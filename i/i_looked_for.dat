500|$|... what is {{interesting}} about this film, perhaps, is the moment when it was made. It was shot between Munich and the war, and I shot it absolutely impressed, absolutely disturbed {{by the state of}} mind of a part of French society, a part of English society, a part of world society. And {{it seemed to me that}} a way of interpreting this state of mind, to the world hopefully, was not to talk of that situation, but tell a frivolous story. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> inspiration to Beaumarchais, to Marivaux, to the classical authors of comedy.|$|E

500|$|As a teenager, Cruz became {{interested}} in acting after seeing the film Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (1990) by Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar. She did casting calls for an agent but was rejected multiple times because the agent {{felt that she was}} too young. Cruz commented on the experience, [...] "I was very extroverted as a kid.... I was studying when I was in high school at night, I was in ballet and I was doing castings. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> an agent and she sent me away three times because I was a little girl but I kept coming back. I'm still with her after all these years." [...] In 1989, at the age of 15, Cruz won an audition at a talent agency over more than 300 other girls. In 1999, Katrina Bayonas, Cruz's agent, commented, [...] "She was absolutely magic [...] It was obvious there was something very impressive about this kid.... She was very green, but there was a presence. There was just something coming from within." ...|$|E

5000|$|... “In my work, I want {{to reveal}} {{what it is}} to be human—in the most simple, basic terms. I want to create a choreographic world where {{strength}} and tenderness are equally important, where touch and separation are meaningful, and where movement takes on the quality of an intimate conversation. Much of my work is about connection. I want to create work that reminds us that we share a common environment and that our similarities are greater than our differences. As a choreographer, I am an observer. <b>I</b> try to <b>look</b> honestly at how dancers connect to movement and to the complex web of relationships. <b>For</b> example, <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> stillness, for that charged moment of non-movement and what that means to dancers examining their internal motivations and those of each other. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> gestures that reach and enfold, hold and rebuff, contain and lose. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> movement that has authenticity and weight. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> focus that reaches deeply inward, yet is clear and open, with active awareness and a sense of reciprocity.” ...|$|R
