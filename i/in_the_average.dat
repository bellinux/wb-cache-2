40|$|PURPOSE:This study {{compared}} some morphological {{features of}} individual rolandic epileptiform discharges, {{used to obtain}} an averaged estimate, {{with those of the}} resulting estimate. METHOD: Twenty-four averaged discharges from EEGs of 24 children showing rolandic spikes were compared with 480 individual discharges used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>averaging.</b> <b>The</b> analysis was based on the occurrence of tangential dipole and "double spike" patterns. RESULTS: <b>In</b> 15 <b>averaged</b> discharges <b>the</b> tangential dipole pattern was found. Individual spikes used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>averaging</b> process displayed <b>the</b> same pattern <b>in</b> 35 - 100 % of them; <b>in</b> <b>the</b> remaining 9 <b>averaged</b> discharges, up to 20 % of the individual spikes showed the same pattern, although this was not found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>averaged</b> waveforms. "Double spike" pattern was found <b>in</b> 11 of <b>the</b> <b>averaged</b> waveforms and was recognized in 50 - 100 % of its individual discharges, whereas up to 45 % of individual spikes showed this pattern without expression <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>averaged</b> waveform. CONCLUSION: When visually analyzing an EEG with rolandic spikes, caution should be exercised in characterizing these patterns, since a few discharges showing them may not be expressed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>averaged</b> waveform and <b>the</b> clinical correlations proposed for these patterns may not apply...|$|R

5|$|During the 8th century BCE, {{the village}} {{was part of the}} Kingdom of Judah. During the days of Jewish king Herod the town was the {{administrative}} center for the district of Idumea. After the turmoil of the First Jewish-Roman War and the Bar Kokhba revolt the town became a thriving Roman colony and a major administrative center under the name of Eleutheropolis. In the early 7th century CE, Bayt Jibrin was conquered by Muslim forces led by 'Amr ibn al-'As. Under the Crusaders in the 12th century, it was known as Beth Gibelin, and had a population of 1,500, compared to 100-150 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> village of the time. It fell to the Mamluks and then the Ottoman Turks. In the 19th century, the al-'Azza family took control of Bayt Jibrin and unsuccessfully attempted to rebel against the Ottomans, ending in the exile and execution of local leaders.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} iterations, no search {{algorithm}} that works only by comparing elements can exhibit better average and worst case performance than binary search. This {{is because the}} comparison tree representing binary search has the fewest levels possible as each level is filled completely with nodes if there are enough. Otherwise, the search algorithm can eliminate few elements in an iteration, {{increasing the number of}} iterations required <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> and worst case. This is the case for other search algorithms based on comparisons, as while they may work faster on some target values, the average performance over all elements is affected. This problem is solved by binary search, as dividing the array in half ensures that the size of both subarrays are as similar as possible.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{within a}} population for a trait that can vary across {{a range of}} values, such as height, can be categorised into three different types. The first is directional selection, which is a shift <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> value of a trait over time—for example, organisms slowly getting taller. Secondly, disruptive selection is selection for extreme trait values and often results in two different values becoming most common, with selection against the average value. This would be when either short or tall organisms had an advantage, but not those of medium height. Finally, in stabilising selection there is selection against extreme trait values on both ends, which causes a decrease in variance around the average value and less diversity. This would, for example, cause organisms to slowly become all the same height.|$|E

5|$|The {{fact that}} it is a seaside city has shaped Póvoa de Varzim's economy: the fishing {{industry}}, from the fishing vessels that put in each day to the canning industry and to the city's fish market, beach agriculture, and seaweed-gathering for fertilizing fields are the result of its geography. Tourism and the related industries are more relevant in Póvoa's economy these days, as fisheries have lost importance. Nevertheless, the mean value of fish landed in 2004, in its seaport, was almost three times that of Matosinhos seaport and significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> vessels' capacity. Its fishing productivity is also comparatively higher than the national average. A Poveira is a traditional Povoan canning factory and most of its production, 80 to 85%, is exported and deals with high-end brands in canned fish, for MDC markets. Export market brands include: Poveira, D'Henry IV, Ala-Arriba, Minerva, and Alva.|$|E
5|$|Charles Onyett of IGN {{found the}} {{gameplay}} enjoyable and {{enough to be}} appreciated by any genre fan. Yet he stated that if players were not Dragon Ball fans, then they will not {{want to play the}} game. Robert Thompson of Nintendojo felt that the game would satisfy fans of both the series and the genre, but he would complain about the ki and Sparking Combo attacks being repetitive, and the story shifting control of the characters, stating it could make unfamiliar gamers disoriented. Ryan Olsen of Kombo.com praised the battle system, calling it more engaging than the ones found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> RPG. Still he would call the game a cut and dry RPG, calling the Active Guard system the only exotic aspect of the game. Neal Ronaghan of Nintendo World Report called the game vanilla with an interesting twists, stating that the fans should be the ones playing the game. He also drew comparisons of the Active Guard system to the Timed Hit system from Super Mario RPG, and Rage Gage to the Limit Break from Final Fantasy. Brittany Vincent of RPGFan would call side quests like Krillin's return home an added treat to the long story. She pointed out the game's difficulty being frustrating, stating that the game will cause players to revert to the start screen many times, yet is still beatable.|$|E
