40|$|ABSTRACT Improper {{management}} of rangelands can cause land degradation {{and reduce the}} economic efficiency of livestock activity. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate soil properties and quantify plant biomass production in four natural rangeland management systems in the Santa Catarina Plateau (Planalto Catarinense) of Brazil. The treatments, which included mowed natural rangeland (NR), burned natural rangeland (BR), natural rangeland improved through the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> after harrowing (IH), and natural rangeland improved through the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> after chisel plowing (IC), were evaluated in a Nitossolo Bruno (Nitisol). In the improved treatments, soil acidity was corrected, phosphate fertilizer was applied, and intercropped annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum), velvet grass (Holcus lanatus), and white clover (Trifolium repens) were sown. Management systems with harrowed or chisel plowed soil showed improved soil physical properties; however, the effect decreased over time and values approached those of burned and mowed natural rangelands. Natural rangeland systems in the establishment phase had little influence on soil organic C. The mowed natural rangeland and improved natural rangeland exhibited greater production of grazing material, while burning the field decreased production and increased the proportion of weeds. Improvement of the natural rangelands increased leguminous biomass for pasture...|$|E
30|$|Most rangelands {{around the}} world are partly {{dominated}} by “novel” or “emerging” ecosystems (Bridgewater et al. 2011). These novel ecosystems contain a combination of new plant species arising as a result of direct or indirect human interferences (Hobbs et al. 2006). According to Milton et al. (2007), novel ecosystems are generally created as a result of management-induced changes in native plant communities, which enable an opportunity for the invasion and/or the increase in the density of alien or exotic plant species. Many plant species have been introduced intentionally to rangeland ecosystems for various purposes. Certainly, intentional <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> may be useful in some circumstances, whereas these introduced species could create unexpected consequences and damage to the native plant communities. However, the likelihood of novel ecosystems introduced in various rangeland ecosystems increases as a result of globalization, land use and climate changes, and nitrogen deposition (Belnap et al. 2012).|$|E
40|$|Plant invasions are {{becoming}} increasingly more discussed issue, primarily due to {{a negative impact on}} global biodiversity. It has also an economic impact and it affects human health. It is therefore important to study the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> and their distribution, and monitor them in some way. This is particularly applied to protected areas, where rare species of plants are often endangered. In this work were described factors that affect distribution of alien plant species in the level of plant communities, landscape and large territories. For the practical part of the work has been selected the Křivoklátsko PLA as a model area, mainly because of detailed botanical mapping. There were analysed diversity, origin and distribution of alien plant species. Also the effect of selected factors on distribution of alien plant species in the Křivoklátsko PLA were assessed. The average altitude is the strongest factor. The second strongest factor is the fraction of anthropogenic habitats and moderate factor is the habitat diversity. The length of rivers is weak predictor and the length of roads is very weak predictor of number of alien plant species...|$|E

Limestone mined spoils are devoid of adequate population of beneficial microbial flora. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are very important constituent of plant- soil-microbe system. In mined spoils the population of AMF is greatly reduced and hence the spoils become very inhospitable for establishment of vegetation. In the present investigation, status of AMF population and its effect on natural regeneration process is studied. It is well known fact that the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi play very important role in establishment of vegetation in degraded lands. Plantation of seedlings inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi provide favorable soil conditions for naturally growing vegetation in the mined overburden spoils. Physico-chemical properties of soil are converted suitable for planted species and thus it allows other species to grow and also provide shade to protect the herbaceous vegetation. <b>Introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> attracts immigration of other species and if they established, may result into a very distinctive floral cover on disturbed lands.

40|$|International audiencePaleoenvironmental studies {{previously}} {{performed on}} Lake Igaliku revealed two agropastoral phases in south Greenland: the Norse settlement from AD 986 to ca. AD 1450 {{and the recent}} installation of sheep farmers, since the 1920 s. To improve {{the knowledge of the}} timing and magnitude of the Greenlandic agropastoral activities, a lipid inventory was realized and compared with biological and geochemical data. During the 12 th century, a major increase in deoxycholic acid (DOC) and coprophilous fungal spores revealed a maximum of herbivores. Synchronously, a minimum of the n-C 29 /n-C 31 alkane ratio and tree and shrub pollen and a maximum of triterpenyl acetates showed a reduction in the tree and shrub cover, because of grazing activities. Lupanone, produced by angiosperms, appeared simultaneously in the molecular content, probably revealing an <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> by the Norse, as it has been the case for Rumex spp. No major erosion was recorded by trimethyl-tetrahydrocrysenes (TTHCs) and titanium (Ti) fluxes. No massive algal production, identified by the n-C 17 /total n-alkane ratio and mesotrophic diatoms, was either revealed. After the Norse abandon (around AD 1450), a return of the vegetation to quasi-pristine conditions was observed in the molecular content. Finally, a re-introduction of sheep in the 1920 s provoked major impacts between the 1970 s and the 1990 s. A major decrease in the n-C 29 /n-C 31 alkane ratio and tree and shrub pollen associated with maxima of triterpenyl acetates, TTHCs, Ti fluxes, and mesotrophic diatoms highlighted a reduction in the tree and shrub cover, a strong soil mobilization, and algal blooms, probably linking to the recent mechanized creation of hay fields and the massive use of fertilizers.

A net gain can be saved to increase plant growth and competitive ability. In this thesis I used Jacobaea vulgaris as a model <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> to study the evolutionary changes in plant anti-herbivore defenses and growth ability.

It indicates parallel evolution took place in these invasive regions since they all differed significantly in climatic conditions. Such parallel evolution is most likely due to the disappearance of selection pressures from specialist herbivores rather than the adaptation to local abiotic factors after invasion. Promotor: P. G.

30|$|The {{consensus}} is that the biological invasion alters the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> communities and soil characteristics (e.g., soil pH and nutrient availability), which may influence AMF community structure and functioning by three different mechanisms according to studies from elsewhere (Parkash and Aggarwal 2009; Rodríguez-Echeverría et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2010; Kivlin and Hawkes 2011; Lekberg et al. 2013).

40|$|Abstract. Simultaneously with {{increasing}} afforestation efforts in western Europe, among conservationists the consciousness is growing that protecting areas to conserve biodiversity {{will not be}} sufficient in the long term, and that also the ecological restoration of more or less severely altered areas will be neces-sary. The probability that recently established forest stands develop towards their ecological reference (i. e. ancient forest) depends largely {{on the possibility of}} the target species to colonize them. We focused on the colonization ability <b>of</b> forest <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> and particularly on so-called ancient forest <b>plant</b> <b>species.</b> Major constraints for ecological forest restoration are the spatial characteristics of the target site (isola-tion, shape and area), imposing dispersal limitations, and in the duration and intensity of the historical land use, leading to changes in habitat characteristics influencing recruitment probability. We reviewed the ecological literature with respect to these constraints and conclude that it takes at least a century to restore the understorey layer of recent forests, even when the target stand is adjacent to a well-developed ancient forest. Both recruitment and dispersal limitation of the target species are responsible for this. Newly established forests should therefore be situated at a minimal distance of the ancient forest source. In other cases, forest <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> {{will not be able to}} colonize the newly established forest on a measurable time scale and artificial <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> forest <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> can be taken into consideration.
