" ... is paid {{handsome}} tribute by Wilson, whose prose {{is mostly}} clear and straightforward, who <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> {{just about everybody}} (though apparently Fidrych’s widow and daughter declined to cooperate), and he {{has come up with}} one wonderful quotation after another. “The Bird” is the funniest and most touching baseball book to come my way in a long time, and it gets the 2013 season off to a splendid start." ...|$|E
6000|$|Midmore grunted impatiently. 'Everybody <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> {{me about}} that brook ever since I came here. It's never done {{anything}} yet.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Brother Tull <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> me," [...] he began. [...] "It {{was your}} father's wish that you marry Tull, and my order. You refused him?" ...|$|E
5000|$|I wished I could <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> you —:Just to say goodbye, Bobby Jean ...|$|R
60|$|I {{might as}} well <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> one of the palm-trees which waved over us.|$|R
60|$|And they <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> us--but not prettily, not at all--rather rude {{we should}} call it.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{hope for}} a good deal from Mr. Brand's influence," [...] Mr. Wentworth went on. [...] "He <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him from the first. And he never touches {{anything}} himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} right for you, Clementina, if you {{preferred}} it--and--I should prefer it. But it wouldn't be right for her. She has given you hopes--she has made promises--she <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> everybody." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! yes. I {{dare say}} Silverbridge <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> you about him. I think he's a stuck-up sort of fellow." [...] To this {{there was not}} a word of reply. [...] "Where did your brother pick him up?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... 73% of tweens {{report that}} their parents <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> them [...] "a lot" [...] about {{internet}} safety ...|$|R
60|$|At {{that moment}} the burly man who <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Tom in the dining car brushed up to them.|$|R
60|$|NICHOLLS (almost brusquely). I could <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> {{you from}} the hall. You're silly to take chances just now.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' said Kim. 'Thy man {{is rather}} yagi [bad-tempered] than yogi [a holy man]. But this priest is new. The Sahib in the Wonder House <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> {{him like a}} brother. O my mother, fill me this bowl. He waits.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "From your son, eh?" [...] Eugenia asked. [...] "He <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> me immensely of you. Oh, {{he talks}} {{of you as}} you would like," [...] the Baroness declared; [...] "as such a son must talk of such a mother!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see, {{they only}} learn it after {{they come out}} here, while I learnt it from my mother, who <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> me in it since I was quite a little boy; so it comes as {{naturally}} to me as to you." ...|$|E
60|$|CHAR. But {{you should}} <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> them, and {{endeavored}} to have shown them {{the danger of}} staying behind.|$|R
60|$|Anne might grieve, but {{she felt}} the {{gratification}} of being <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> by her uncle {{as a woman who}} could understand, as he <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> her mother.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that Luce, during the 1960s, tried LSD and reported that he <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> God under its influence.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! {{that would}} be too bad! Mamma <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> me so much. She said I must make it a rule never to have debts. She showed me how she pays her bills every week, and gave me a great book like hers. I began at Winchester.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't tell you; I don't {{understand}} you. It's all over; {{please let}} it rest. Osmond <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> {{me a great}} deal about it, and I've nothing more to say or to hear. I've no doubt," [...] Isabel added, [...] "that he'll be very happy to discuss the subject with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} it very much, Hare. Once a prophet heard an ass speak {{in order to}} warn him. But since then, except very, very rarely in dreams, no {{creature}} <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> a man, so far as I know. Perhaps you wish to warn me about something, or others through me, as the ass warned Balaam." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's Nag or Nagaina,' {{he said to}} himself; 'and he's {{crawling}} {{into the}} bath-room sluice. You're right, Chuchundra; I should <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Chua.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{could almost}} have fancied {{you were not}} pleased to see us, and would sooner <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Torrance," [...] said Miss Schuyler.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile Horne Fisher had {{considerably}} puzzled everybody {{with his}} new tone and attitude. He <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> the colonel about the military and mechanical arrangements, and displayed a remarkable knowledge both {{of the details of}} discipline and the technicalities of electricity. He <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> the clergyman, and shown an equally surprising knowledge of the religious and historical interests involved in the relic. He <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> the man who called himself a magician, and not only surprised but scandalized the company by an equally sympathetic familiarity with the most fantastic forms of Oriental occultism and psychic experiment. And in this last and least respectable line of inquiry he was evidently prepared to go farthest; he openly encouraged the magician, and was plainly prepared to follow the wildest ways of investigation in which that magus might lead him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Through an {{extraordinary}} fancy he has suddenly taken to her." [...] Mrs. Brook had been swift {{to master the}} facts. [...] "He has been meeting her at Tishy's, and she <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him so effectually about his behaviour that she has quite made him cease to care for Carrie. He prefers HER now--and of course she's much nicer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind that," [...] {{returned}} the policeman, cheerfully. [...] "I have feasted my eyes upon all the beauties visible from this tree, and {{my good friend}} the Guardian <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> me and given me much good advice that will surely be useful {{to me in the}} future. So I have been quite contented while you were gone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, {{that is the}} {{way with}} all your gentle and pure-hearted creatures. I have seen some of you before, and have heard of others. The Sergeant himself <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> me of his own young days, and of your mother, and of the manner in which he courted her, and of all the {{crossings}} and disappointments, until he succeeded at last." ...|$|E
60|$|She was right. It {{was of no}} use. As well {{might one}} <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> the wooden cuckoo, already {{referred}} to, in Mrs Potter's timepiece.|$|R
5000|$|December 2003 or January 2004: Rove's lawyer Robert Luskin says Rove {{has signed}} a waiver authorizing {{prosecutors}} to speak to any reporters Rove <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mr. Kendal made no answer. Albinia {{ventured to}} ask him whether {{it would not be}} better to leave it, since her aunt <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, yes; I am not {{thinking}} of individuals exactly. His want of generosity is to large masses,--to a party, to classes, to a people; whereas his generosity is for mankind at large. He assumes the god, affects to nod, and seems to shake the spheres. But I have nothing against him. He has asked me here to-night, and <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> me most familiarly about Ireland." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Alora <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Irene a {{good deal}} about that dreadful will," [...] replied Mary Louise, [...] "Irene has {{repeated}} many of her statements to me. Also Alora has frankly spoken to me, at times, and her queer history has interested us all. But I cannot remember that any such person as you describe is in any way mixed up with the story. Judge Bernsted drew up the will for Alora's mother. He was her lawyer, and she trusted him fully." ...|$|E
60|$|No, it isn't. I {{tell you}} I can't do {{anything}} else. I'm bound hand and foot. Lucy <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> me of George's death, {{and the only}} thing that has consoled her is the idea that in a manner he had redeemed his father's good name. How can I rob her of that? She placed all her hopes in George. How could she face the world with the knowledge that her brother was rotten to the core, as rotten as her father.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, my dear, I believe so. He {{wished to}} see you, too; but I asked his {{permission}} to postpone that till after I <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's Nag or Nagaina," [...] {{he said to}} himself, [...] "and he is {{crawling}} {{into the}} bath-room sluice. You're right, Chuchundra; I should <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Chua." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, not any one <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Christina on the matter; and she strenuously {{repeated}} her own first question in a panic of self-defence.|$|R
