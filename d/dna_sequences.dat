5|$|Research in {{the early}} 2000s {{combining}} the use of phylogenetic analyses of <b>DNA</b> <b>sequences</b> and more traditional morphology-based characters {{has resulted in a}} reshuffling of the species concept in Gomphus; as a result, G.clavatus is considered the only Gomphus species in North America. Comparison of the <b>DNA</b> <b>sequences</b> of species Gomphus brevipes and Gomphus truncatus has shown them to be genetically identical to G.clavatus, and they may be treated as synonyms.|$|E
5|$|A few <b>DNA</b> <b>sequences</b> in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, {{and more}} in {{plasmids}} and viruses, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having overlapping genes. In these cases, some <b>DNA</b> <b>sequences</b> do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read {{in the opposite direction}} along the other strand. In bacteria, this overlap may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription, while in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small viral genome.|$|E
5|$|Because DNA {{collects}} mutations over time, {{which are}} then inherited, it contains historical information, and, by comparing <b>DNA</b> <b>sequences,</b> geneticists can infer the evolutionary history of organisms, their phylogeny. This field of phylogenetics is a powerful tool in evolutionary biology. If <b>DNA</b> <b>sequences</b> within a species are compared, population geneticists can learn the history of particular populations. This {{can be used in}} studies ranging from ecological genetics to anthropology; For example, DNA evidence is being used to try to identify the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{morphology}} recognises {{a continuum}} between the major morphological categories of root, stem (caulome), leaf (phyllome) and trichome. Furthermore, it emphasises structural dynamics. Modern systematics {{aims to reflect}} and discover phylogenetic relationships between plants. Modern Molecular phylogenetics largely ignores morphological characters, relying on <b>DNA</b> <b>sequences</b> as data. Molecular analysis of <b>DNA</b> <b>sequences</b> from most families of flowering plants enabled the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group to publish in 1998 a phylogeny of flowering plants, answering {{many of the questions}} about relationships among angiosperm families and species. The theoretical possibility of a practical method for identification of plant species and commercial varieties by DNA barcoding is the subject of active current research.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{analysis}} of the <b>DNA</b> <b>sequences</b> of the internal transcribed spacer (IT) region of S.thailandica showed that the species {{was part of the}} Boletineae, one of several lineages of Boletales recognized taxonomically at the level of suborder. The similarity between S.thailandica and S.squarepantsii was confirmed with molecular analysis, which showed a 98% match between large subunit ribosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>sequences</b> of the two—a value typical of many species in the same genus of Boletaceae. Spongiforma is sister (sharing a common ancestor) to the genus Porphyrellus; Spongiforma and Porphyrellus form a clade that is sister to Strobilomyces. All three genera are members of the Boletaceae family.|$|E

By examining <b>DNA</b> <b>sequence</b> differences within and between species, we are able to infer various characteristics of the DFE for neutral, deleterious and advantageous mutations.

5|$|To help clarify {{species and}} {{subspecies}} boundaries, {{and to establish}} whether morphology-based classifications were consistent with evolutionary relationships, the phylogenetic relationships within the genus Nycticebus have been investigated using <b>DNA</b> <b>sequences</b> derived from the mitochondrial markers D loop and cytochrome b. Although most of the recognized lineages of Nycticebus (including N.pygmaeus, N. menagensis and N.javanicus) were shown to be genetically distinct—the analysis suggested that <b>DNA</b> <b>sequences</b> from some individuals of N.coucang and N.bengalensis apparently share a closer evolutionary relationship with each other than with {{members of their own}} species.

5|$|Deoxyribozymes, {{also called}} DNAzymes or {{catalytic}} DNA, are first discovered in 1994. They are mostly single stranded <b>DNA</b> <b>sequences</b> isolated {{from a large}} pool of random <b>DNA</b> <b>sequences</b> through a combinatorial approach called in vitro selection or systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). DNAzymes catalyze variety of chemical reactions including RNA-DNA cleavage, RNA-DNA ligation, amino acids phosphorylation-dephosphorylation, carbon-carbon bond formation, and etc. DNAzymes can enhance catalytic rate of chemical reactions up to 100,000,000,000-fold over the uncatalyzed reaction. The most extensively studied class of DNAzymes is RNA-cleaving types which {{have been used to}} detect different metal ions and designing therapeutic agents. Several metal-specific DNAzymes have been reported including the GR-5 DNAzyme (lead-specific), the CA1-3 DNAzymes (copper-specific), the 39E DNAzyme (uranyl-specific) and the NaA43 DNAzyme (sodium-specific). The NaA43 DNAzyme, which is reported to be more than 10,000-fold selective for sodium over other metal ions, was used to make a real-time sodium sensor in living cells.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, other {{proteins}} {{have evolved}} to bind to particular <b>DNA</b> <b>sequences.</b> The most intensively studied of these are the various transcription factors, which are proteins that regulate transcription. Each transcription factor binds to one particular set of <b>DNA</b> <b>sequences</b> and activates or inhibits the transcription of genes that have these sequences close to their promoters. The transcription factors do this in two ways. Firstly, they can bind the RNA polymerase responsible for transcription, either directly or through other mediator proteins; this locates the polymerase at the promoter and allows it to begin transcription. Alternatively, transcription factors can bind enzymes that modify the histones at the promoter. This changes the accessibility of the DNA template to the polymerase.|$|E
