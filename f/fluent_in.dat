40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} an action language, ALM, for {{the representation of}} knowledge about dynamic systems. It extends action language AL by allowing definitions of new objects (actions and <b>fluents)</b> <b>in</b> terms of other, previously defined, objects. This, together with the modular structure of the language, leads to more elegant and concise representations and facilitates the creation of libraries of knowledge modules. ...|$|R

40|$|In this talk, we survey recent {{results on}} {{situation}} calculus bounded action theories. These are action theories with the constraints {{that the size}} of the extension of <b>fluents</b> <b>in</b> every situation must be bounded, though such an extension changes from situation to situation. Such action theories give rise to infinite transition systems that can be faithfully abstracted into finite ones, making verification decidable...|$|R

40|$|An {{additive}} fluent is a fluent with {{numerical values}} {{such that the}} effect of several concurrently executed actions on it can be computed by adding the effects of the individual actions.

An implementation of this language, called the Causal Calculator, can be used for the automation of examples of commonsense reasoning involving additive fluents. ...|$|R
