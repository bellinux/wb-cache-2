The importance of the lake for transportation declined after the arrival of the railroad in the region in 1849, and even the ferry service across the lake was discontinued in 1975.|$|R

50|$|The city of Burlington, Vermont's largest, was {{chartered}} in 1765 and saw early {{settlement in}} the 1770s. Significant development was delayed by the American Revolutionary War. The area south {{of what is now}} its downtown area became an early center of commerce, and it was at the home Gideon King (still standing on King Street) where the city's proprietors platted out its street grid. The wharves on Lake Champlain were controlled by King and that area has remained a nexus of commerce and transport through the transition from water-based transport to rail-based, and then also truck-based, transport. The area east of King's wharf and south of Main Street developed as a transport support area, with warehouses for the storage of <b>goods</b> <b>awaiting</b> shipment, and was augmented by light industry, including the manufacture of items, such as paper tubes and boxes. The waterfront was also the site of Burlington's only shipyard. Areas further inland were also developed residentially, but today reflect a mix of uses.|$|R

The occupation of Cambambe was very costly to Portugal on account of resistance offered by the natives to the foreign authority. Besides enforcing the armed presence of Portugal, the fortress was used for the storage of prisoners and <b>goods</b> <b>awaiting</b> shipment to the Americas. Cambambe was an important center for illegal activity and the slave trade. From here, the Portuguese organized attacks on nearby villages to capture slaves. The Fortress of Kambambe was classified as National Monument by Provincial Decree Number 67, dated May 30, 1925. Later it fell into ruins and is a state property.

[...] Dutch and Plymouth Colonists had been leapfrogging their way up [...] "the Great River," [...] {{as far north as}} Windsor, Connecticut, attempting to establish its northernmost village to gain the greatest access to the region's raw materials. Pynchon selected a spot just north of Enfield Falls, the first spot on the Connecticut River where all travelers have to stop to negotiate a waterfall 32 ft in height, and then transship their cargoes from ocean-going vessels to smaller shallops. By founding Springfield, Pynchon positioned himself as the northernmost trader on the Connecticut River. Near Enfield Falls, he erected a warehouse to store <b>goods</b> <b>awaiting</b> shipment, which is still called [...] "Warehouse Point" [...] to this day, located in East Windsor, Connecticut.|$|R

40|$|Inventory {{can be one}} of {{the most}} {{expensive}} assets of an organization. It may account for than 10 % of total revenue or 20 % of total assets for some organization. Although companies in the manufacturing sector usually carry more inventory than service firms, effective inventory management is nonetheless important to both manufactures and service organization. The focus of this work is to show the integration of inventory management as a key to organizational profitability and efficient delivery. The definitions of inventory as a lifeblood of any business, the need for inventory and its control, determining safety stock and some other relevant issues on inventory management had been emphasized in this work. Various authors, experts and professionals work has been cited reviewed for better understanding. Among them are:- David Burt et al (8 th) edition: Supply management, A.

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. E. E. thesis. November 2016. Major: Electrical/Computer Engineering. Advisors: Marc Riedel, Zhi-Li Zhang. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 83 pages. Communication systems rely on underlying networks and networking infrastructure to send information from one participating node to another. In {{this process of}} data transmission, the sent information experiences delays in the network. The amount of network delay depends on the underlying network, the processing elements (such as routers, switches etc.) and time taken for physical transmission. These delays are constituted by various paths that transmitted packets take and queues that they wait in before arriving at the destination. The delays ``emulate'' temporary data storage. This study explores and analyzes this transient storage in different types of networks. The study introduces transient storage and data cycling {{from the perspective of}} physics and in electro-optical computer networks. Such transient storage can be used to solve problems where data storage and data validity is ephemeral. For example, handling packets from new flows at an OpenFlow switch while it <b>awaits</b> <b>handling</b> rules from the controller or distribution of data generated by a sensor network where data becomes invalid after a short time. Furthermore, transient data storage can be used to manage context in fast changing networks where central control or storage is hard to implement. Transient data storage in networks utilizes the network bandwidth which would otherwise simply remain unused. In this work, transient storage, leveraging networking and queuing delays is used to build an ephemeral storage system by creating loops of networked nodes. Data can be cycled on loops for temporary storage before being used. A loop of nodes is used to demonstrate the idea of data cycling and transient storage. Data cycling experiments are setup to characterize and study its effects on network traffic. Further, applications of transient storage are discussed. A novel application of transient data storage for accumulative counting in vehicular networks is developed and analyzed in detail. This application is implemented and simulated on a network simulator to study its performance and sensitivity to variation of tunable parameters...|$|R
