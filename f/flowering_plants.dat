5|$|The {{silver birch}} has an open canopy which allows plenty {{of light to}} reach the ground. This allows a variety of mosses, grasses and <b>flowering</b> <b>plants</b> to grow beneath which in turn attract insects. <b>Flowering</b> <b>plants</b> often found in birch woods include {{primrose}} (Primula vulgaris), violet (Viola riviniana), bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa) and wood sorrel (Oxalis acetosella).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{this research}} was to classify <b>flower</b> <b>plant</b> diseases by implementing Rule Based technique. There were several types of <b>flower</b> <b>plants</b> and diseases were conducted for this research which were six types of <b>flower</b> <b>plants</b> and seven types of diseases. Orchid, Hibiscus, Sunflower, Roses, Daylily and Jasmine were the six types of <b>flower</b> <b>plant</b> while black spot, insects, leaf spot, mildew, microorganism, rust and sooty mold were the diseases that are covered in this research. This system consisted of two users or actors which interact within it which were the owner of Rumpun Damai Nursery itself and the staff. Currently, {{the management of the}} nursery regarding the diseases infected to the plant are unorganized. This was because of some factors such as lack of knowledge regarding the <b>flower</b> <b>plant</b> diseases among the owner and staff at the nursery. Therefore, in order to solved those problem, the objective have been identified that lead to the conducting of this research. This classification system can help the owner and staff at Rumpun Damai Nursery to identify <b>flower</b> <b>plant</b> diseases. In order to apply Rule Based technique in this research, the data regarding the <b>flower</b> <b>plant</b> and diseases need to gathered first and undergo preprocessing method. The picture of <b>flower</b> <b>plants</b> that infected to diseases from the Nursery also undergo the image processing method by using Matlab tools to identify the attribute symptoms. This system applied Waterfall Model methodology as the framework to supervise all the process. The result of {{this research was}} a prototype system that can identified the diseases been infected by the <b>flower</b> <b>plants</b> with the list of symptoms showed the diseases...|$|R

5|$|Modern {{morphology}} recognises {{a continuum}} between the major morphological categories of root, stem (caulome), leaf (phyllome) and trichome. Furthermore, it emphasises structural dynamics. Modern systematics {{aims to reflect}} and discover phylogenetic relationships between plants. Modern Molecular phylogenetics largely ignores morphological characters, relying on DNA sequences as data. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences from most families of <b>flowering</b> <b>plants</b> enabled the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group to publish in 1998 a phylogeny of <b>flowering</b> <b>plants,</b> answering {{many of the questions}} about relationships among angiosperm families and species. The theoretical possibility of a practical method for identification of plant species and commercial varieties by DNA barcoding is the subject of active current research.|$|E

5|$|In 1998 the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group {{published}} a phylogeny for <b>flowering</b> <b>plants</b> {{based on an}} analysis of DNA sequences from most families of <b>flowering</b> <b>plants.</b> As {{a result of this}} work, many questions, such as which families represent the earliest branches of angiosperms, have now been answered. Investigating how plant species are related to each other allows botanists to better understand the process of evolution in plants. Despite the study of model plants and increasing use of DNA evidence, there is ongoing work and discussion among taxonomists about how best to classify plants into various taxa. Technological developments such as computers and electron microscopes have greatly increased the level of detail studied and speed at which data can be analysed.|$|E
