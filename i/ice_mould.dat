40|$|A novel shaping {{technique}} for advanced ceramic components is presented which allows manufacturing of complex ceramic components with enclosed cavities by using ice moulds or ice cores. Different suspensions of alumina and zirconia powders {{have been developed}} for this special freeze casting technique. The suspensions must meet following requirements: high solid content, the capability of flow, a freezing point between - 10 and - 2 °C, and a casting temperature below 0 °C. After the casting process the moulds and cores could be easily removed by sublimation. The suspension liquid was removed in the frozen state simultaneously. In this way very complicated hollow or filled structures such as metallic or ceramic components encapsulated in ceramic shells could be produced. No de-moulding was necessary, no solid core must be removed, and no liquid phase appeared as known from other lost-mould techniques. <b>Ice</b> <b>mould</b> casting is a very environmental-friendly shaping technique. Furthermore, the influence of dispersing agents, anti-freeze agents and of the freezing speed on the pore structure of the ceramic components has been investigated...|$|E
40|$|Porous, hollow ceramic {{components}} were produced by freeze casting technique. For this purpose aqueous slurries with high solid contents were prepared which were stable against freezing down {{to at least}} - 5 deg C. Ice cores were made by coating steel components with freezing water which were subsequently dip-coated with the ceramic suspensions. After freeze drying which removes both, the ice core and the frozen suspension liquid, and sintering, ceramic components with a high amount of open porosity including steel parts could be achieved. As an example hydroxyapatite was used for showing the opportunities of the freeze casting technology among others for applications {{in the field of}} bone replacement. The influence of the solid content of the hydroxyapatite slurries on the ice crystal growth has been investigated by means of compact hydroxyapatite bodies which were prepared by freeze casting using <b>ice</b> <b>moulds</b> with cylindrical cavities.

40|$|Some glacial and aeolian geomorphological {{features}} {{express themselves}} as parallel lineaments on satellite images. These landforms represent readily available evidence for reconstructing Quaternary environments, and {{are believed to}} have preserved in their morphometry, evidence of their formation. Drumlins, megatlutes, tlutes and mega-lineaments are typical examples of glacial lineaments, while linear sand dunes are examples of aeolian lineaments. The main aim of this thesis was to develop an objective method of characterising the spacing between parallel glacial and aeolian lineaments and to attempt to answer some geomorphological questions about them. The method of spectral analysis based on fourier transformation was used. Spectral analysis on radiometric transects taken perpendicular to the trend of parallel lineaments on satellite images permits the spacing between these lineaments to be assessed and thus the dominant spatial frequency to be determined. This provides a quick and efficient method of morphometric analysis. A methodology for doing this has been established and applied to examples of large scale <b>ice</b> <b>moulded</b> landforms in Canada and aeolian linear sand dunes from the Kalahari desert. Analysis of the spacings obtained showed that for the case of aeolian lineaments in the study area, there was no significant trend in spacing up or downwind indicating equilibrium in spacing in the overall dunefield. The analysis of the spatial frequency of glacial lineaments established that a significant relationship existed between lineament spatial frequencies and inferred velocities and that the behaviour of the spacing is systematic up/down ice. An important result obtained from analysing these lineaments was that the spatial distribution showed a concentration of spacing at a particular range of frequencies (150 to 750 metres) proving that the distribution of the landforms is not multimodal as has been previously hypothesised but is scale continuous...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper compiles {{and reviews}} marine and {{terrestrial}} data constraining the dimensions and {{configuration of the}} Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet (APIS) from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) through deglaciation to the present day. These data are used to reconstruct grounding-line retreat in 5  ka time-steps from 25  ka BP to present. Glacial landforms and subglacial tills on the eastern and western Antarctic Peninsula (AP) shelf indicate that the APIS was grounded to the outer shelf/shelf edge at the LGM and contained a series of fast-flowing ice streams that drained along cross-shelf bathymetric troughs. The ice sheet was grounded at the shelf edge until ∼ 20  cal ka BP. Chronological control on retreat is provided by radiocarbon dates on glacimarine sediments from the shelf troughs and on lacustrine and terrestrial organic remains, as well as cosmogenic nuclide dates on erratics and <b>ice</b> <b>moulded</b> bedrock. Retreat in the east was underway by about 18  cal ka BP. The earliest dates on recession in the west are from Bransfield Basin where recession was underway by 17. 5  cal ka BP. Ice streams were active during deglaciation {{at least until the}} ice sheet had pulled back to the mid-shelf. The timing of initial retreat decreased progressively southwards along the western AP shelf; the large ice stream in Marguerite Trough may have remained grounded at the shelf edge until about 14  cal ka BP, although terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide ages indicate that thinning had commenced by 18  ka BP. Between 15 and 10  cal ka BP the APIS underwent significant recession along the western AP margin, although retreat between individual troughs was asynchronous. Ice in Marguerite Trough may have still been grounded on the mid-shelf at 10  cal ka BP. In the Larsen-A region the transition from grounded to floating ice was established by 10. 7 – 10. 6  cal ka BP. The APIS had retreated towards its present configuration in the western AP by the mid-Holocene but on the eastern peninsula may have approached its present configuration several thousand years earlier, by the start of the Holocene. Mid to late-Holocene retreat was diachronous with stillstands, re-advances and changes in ice-shelf configuration being recorded in most places. Subglacial topography exerted a major control on grounding-line retreat with grounding-zone wedges, and thus by inference slow-downs or stillstands in the retreat of the grounding line, occurring in some cases on reverse bed slopes...|$|R
25|$|The {{last major}} {{geological}} event {{to shape the}} Wicklow Mountains was the Quaternary glaciation during the Pleistocene epoch (2.6 million to 11,700 years ago). The <b>ice</b> deepened and <b>moulded</b> the valleys into the U-shape that characterises the Wicklow Glens, such as Glendalough and Glenmacnass. As the ice melted, small glaciers were left in corries where moraines now dam lakes such as at Loughs Bray and Nahanagan. Corries without lakes also occur, such as the North Prison and South Prison of Lugnaquilla. Escaping meltwater cut narrow rocky gorges at several locations including the Glen of the Downs, the Devil's Glen and The Scalp. Ribbon lakes, such as Lough Dan and the lakes of Glendalough, also formed.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} to examine basic properties (anatomical structure, chemical, physical and mechanical) of jabon merah wood (Anthocephalus macrophyllus (Roxb.) Havil) taken from natural forest in Luwu Timur District South Sulawesi Province. Potential uses of wood were determined by considering those properties and wood uses which the local inhabitants have currently employed. Results revealed that jabon merah heartwood is yellowish rather tend to red in colour and not clearly distinct from the sapwood, texture is rather fine and even, grain is straight and sometimes rather interlocked, wood surface is rather glossy, rather smooth to smooth in touch, and moderate in hardness. Fiber is remarkably long with very thin wall thickness. High in cellulose and extractive, moderate in lignin and low in pentose content. Moderate in specific gravity (0. 48), very low in shrinkage and classified in wood strength class III. Potential uses are for light construction material under roof, cheap furniture, handicraft, measuring and drawing instruments, pencil, box and stick of matches, toothpick, spoon and handles of <b>ice</b> cream, <b>moulding,</b> wood composites, pulp and paper, pallet, packing box and concrete forms.
