5|$|Sir Boyle Roche, 1st Baronet (October 1736 – 5 June 1807) was an Irish politician. After a {{distinguished}} career in North America with the British Army, Roche {{became a member}} of the Irish House of Commons in 1775, generally acting in support of the viceregal government. He is better remembered for the language of his speeches than his politicsthey were riddled with mixed metaphors ("Mr Speaker, I smell a rat; <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> forming in the air and darkening the sky; but I'll nip him in the bud"), malapropisms and other unfortunate turns of phrase ("Why we should put ourselves out of our way to do anything for posterity, for what has posterity ever done for us?"). Roche may have been Richard Brinsley Sheridan's model for Mrs Malaprop.|$|E
25|$|Mary used {{a drummer}} added to Bob, Mary and myself on {{electric}} bass. We did {{almost all the}} Les Paul-Mary Ford recordings but with more heavy end on the bass. Les having used guitar on his bass tracks with Mary earlier. On all their recordings (as good as they were), I always missed that deep dark sound... Mary (bless her heart) recorded {{a few of my}} compositions (never released), but she did an excellent job as always. Mary divorced Les Paul and later married her old school friend from Monrovia, California, namely Don Hatfield, who owned a large construction company in California. He is still with us, and <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> occasionally. Doing great, but he misses Mary.|$|E
500|$|As {{exemplified}} on {{his debut}} for Racing, a performance {{in which he}} demonstrated his aerial power, {{he is capable of}} playing with his back to goal, and his height was not incompatible with agility. He prefers to play not as a lone striker but in partnership with a shorter, speedier, teammate. Racing's fitness coach, Javier Miñano, was surprised that Žigić was [...] "well coordinated, {{to the extent that he}} doesn't seem so tall when <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> in training." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I am Wickens's boy," [...] {{said the}} witness, partly fierce, partly lachrymose, [...] "and <b>I</b> say <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him,</b> {{and if anyone}} sez <b>I</b> didn't <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> he's a lie." ...|$|R
60|$|VOICES: No, he didn't. <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him.</b> The girl there. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldier and civilian.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure I {{can find}} <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> when <b>I</b> first came in, but <b>I</b> can't <b>see</b> his face because he's {{hiding behind the}} prosecuting attorney." ...|$|R
500|$|Some {{critics have}} dissented from {{the view of}} Dylan as a visionary figure in popular music. In his book Awopbopaloobop Alopbamboom, Nik Cohn objected: [...] "I can't take the vision of Dylan as seer, as teenage messiah, as {{everything}} else he's been worshipped as. The way <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> he's a minor talent with a major gift for self-hype." [...] Australian critic Jack Marx credited Dylan with changing the persona of the rock star: [...] "What cannot be disputed is that Dylan invented the arrogant, faux-cerebral posturing {{that has been the}} dominant style in rock since, with everyone from Mick Jagger to Eminem educating themselves from the Dylan handbook." ...|$|E
500|$|Regarding her {{involvement}} in a sequel to The Silence of the Lambs, Foster confirmed to Larry King in 1997 that she [...] "would definitely be part of it." [...] She told Entertainment Weekly magazine in 1997 that [...] "Anthony Hopkins always talks about it. I mean, everybody wants to do it. Every time <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> it's like: 'When {{is it going to}} happen? When is it going to happen?'" [...] De Laurentiis thought Foster would decline once she read the book, even believing the final film was better for it. Hopkins also had doubts Foster would be involved, saying he had a [...] "hunch" [...] she would not be. Foster did turn it down, confirming this in late December 1999.|$|E
500|$|The same {{search for}} direct intuition and {{understanding}} {{can be seen}} with Vivekananda. Not satisfied with his knowledge of philosophy, Narendra came to [...] "the question which marked the real beginning of his intellectual quest for God." [...] He asked several prominent Calcutta residents if they had come [...] "face to face with God", but none of their answers satisfied him. At this time, Narendra met Debendranath Tagore (the leader of Brahmo Samaj) {{and asked if he}} had seen God. Instead of answering his question, Tagore said [...] "My boy, you have the Yogis eyes." [...] According to Banhatti, it was Ramakrishna who really answered Narendra's question, by saying [...] "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>Him</b> as I see you, only in an infinitely intenser sense." [...] Nevertheless, Vivekananda was more influenced by the Brahmo Samaj's and its new ideas, than by Ramakrishna. It was Sen's influence who brought Vivekananda fully into contact with western esotericism, and it was also via Sen that he met Ramakrishna.|$|E
60|$|The youth's {{face had}} haunted me. Where had <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> before. There was {{something}} strangely familiar in every line of him; in his carriage, his manner of speaking, his gestures. I {{could have sworn}} that I knew him, and yet I knew too that <b>I</b> had never <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> before.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I'm tryin' to tell you-all because I thought you-all {{ought to}} know,' says the tenderfoot. 'I tell you-all <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> deal hisself four aces.' ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{the giant}} answered, 'Yes, <b>I</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> pass, but <b>I</b> have not <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> come back. The spell must have worked upon him.' ...|$|R
500|$|In August, del Potro won {{his third}} {{consecutive}} title at the Countrywide Classic in Los Angeles, beating Andy Roddick in straight sets in the final. After the match, Roddick praised his opponent. [...] " [...] hits {{this way and}} this way kind of equally and he can hit it from inside out and running to it, {{which is a good}} thing for him, bad for the rest of us". A fourth consecutive title followed a week later in the Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington, D.C., where he recorded a victory over Viktor Troicki, becoming the first player in ATP history to win his first four career titles in as many tournaments. [...] "I don't really understand what I did. It is difficult to believe that I have won four consecutive titles", del Potro said, crediting coach Franco Davín for his impressive run. [...] "He changed my game. He changed my mind. He changed everything. When I play and <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> in the stands, it gives me confidence. I can play relaxed." ...|$|E
500|$|On 8 August 2010, Robinson {{retired from}} {{international}} football with immediate effect, despite having been selected for a friendly against Hungary. He said about his retirement, [...] "Only now have I {{been able to}} make this decision as previously I haven't been in contention for selection, I don't see myself as a number three or four keeper and find that role very frustrating," [...] while Allardyce backed his decision, stating, [...] "As my player, I support him because <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> week in, week out and know how well he has performed. It's a big decision he's made, but I understand it." [...] In his international career, Robinson had won 41 caps for England, 25 of which came in competitive international matches (either the qualification or final rounds of the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship). Despite Steve Kean stating that England should recall him in March 2012, Robinson stated that he had no interest in a return later that month. In February 2014, Robinson said that he would be open to an international return for the 2014 FIFA World Cup if England manager Roy Hodgson decided to recall him.|$|E
500|$|At {{the meeting}} of the Estates, Henry thanked Catherine for all she had done. He called her not only the mother of the king but the mother of the state. Henry did not tell Catherine of his plan for a {{solution}} to his problems. On 23 December 1588, he asked the Duke of Guise to call on him at the Château de Blois. As Guise entered the king's chamber, the Forty-five plunged their blades into his body, and he died {{at the foot of the}} king's bed. At the same moment, eight members of the Guise family were rounded up, including the Duke of Guise's brother, Louis II, Cardinal of Guise, whom Henry's men hacked to death the next day in the palace dungeons. Immediately after the murder of Guise, Henry entered Catherine's bedroom on the floor below and announced, [...] "Please forgive me. Monsieur de Guise is dead. He will not be spoken of again. I have had him killed. I have done to him what he was going to do to me." [...] Catherine's immediate reaction is not known; but on Christmas Day, she told a friar, [...] "Oh, wretched man! What has he done?... Pray for him... <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> rushing towards his ruin." [...] She visited her old friend Cardinal de Bourbon on 1 January 1589 to tell him she was sure he would soon be freed. He shouted at her, [...] "Your words, Madam, have led us all to this butchery." [...] She left in tears.|$|E

2500|$|He had the {{pleasing}} {{face and}} he was very virtuous. His speaking style was so delightful that people were not tired of hearing his words and his bright face was very charming. Khomeini said about him: «When <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> he reminds me of Allah.» ...|$|E
2500|$|... "You {{have many}} good boys, but none {{can match the}} good {{heart and soul of}} Dominic Savio. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> so often at prayer, staying in church after the others; every day he slips out of the {{playground}} to make a visit to the Blessed Sacrament. When he is in church he is like an angel living in Paradise." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Britain, the Union of Islamic Students' Associations in Europe {{issued a}} {{statement}} offering its services to Khomeini. Despite incitement to murder being illegal in the United Kingdom, one London property developer told reporters, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> I will kill him straight away. Take my name and address. One day I will kill him".|$|E

2500|$|On 24 May 2004, {{a fire in}} the Momart storage {{warehouse}} destroyed many {{works from}} the Saatchi collection, including 17 of Hirst's, although the sculpture Charity survived, as it was outside in the builder's yard. That July, Hirst said of Saatchi, [...] "I respect Charles. There's not really a feud. If <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> we speak, but we were never really drinking buddies." ...|$|E
2500|$|DMX is a Christian and {{has stated}} {{he reads the}} Bible every day. While in prison, DMX stated {{that he had a}} purpose for being there: [...] "I came here to meet somebody...Don't know who it was, but I'll know when <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> And I came here to give him a message.

2500|$|Geronimo has cited Michael Jackson as her major {{influence}} and {{she grew up}} singing and dancing to his music. Geronimo said: [...] "As a child my dream was to be hugely popular like Michael Jackson. I wanted {{to have that kind}} of worldwide fame," [...] added, [...] "I want to be like him, while performing, everyone gets so wild and emotional. Besides that, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> as not only a performer, he’s an inspiration to many people, and that’s what I also want to become." [...] Geronimo also cited American pop star, Beyoncé as one of her influences in singing and dancing live.|$|E
6000|$|These Wednesdays {{were the}} happiest days of Mr. Dick's life; {{they were far}} from being the least happy of mine. He soon became known to every boy in the school; and though he never took an active part in any game but kite-flying, was as deeply {{interested}} in all our sports as anyone among us. How often have <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him,</b> intent upon a match at marbles or pegtop, looking on with a face of unutterable interest, and hardly breathing at the critical times! How often, at hare and hounds, have <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> mounted on a little knoll, cheering the whole field on to action, and waving his hat above his grey head, oblivious of King Charles the Martyr's head, and all belonging to it! How many a summer hour have I known to be but blissful minutes to him in the cricket-field! How many winter days have <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him,</b> standing blue-nosed, in the snow and east wind, looking at the boys going down the long slide, and clapping his worsted gloves in rapture! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He knows {{a regular}} lot of people, {{and all sorts}} of things. He's been a dentist, and he's a {{qualified}} chemist, an' <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> often reading German and French. Taught 'imself. He was here----" ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{an article}} in the Daily Mail, Shayler claimed that {{he was the son of}} God stating, [...] "I am the messiah and hold the secret of eternal life," [...] and that he was the reincarnation of various {{historical}} figures. He speaks positively about David Icke, another individual who has claimed to be the son of God: [...] "David has done some enormously important work. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> as the John the Baptist to my Christ. I have spoken to him on the phone and suggested we meet." [...] Shayler has said he is committed to destroying what he calls the [...] "Zionist empire".|$|E
2500|$|Bill James {{predicted}} that in 2011 Kalish would bat [...]271, with 20 {{home runs and}} 43 stolen bases. By comparison, James anticipated that Carl Crawford would steal one fewer base. [...] J. P. Ricciardi, {{special assistant to the}} Mets general manager, {{predicted that}} Kalish will be [...] "a star". [...] Peter Gammons said during spring training that comparisons of Kalish and [...] Trot Nixon may underestimate Kalish's potential: [...] I have great respect for Trot Nixon, but Ryan Kalish is a totally different athlete. He is a great athlete. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> being a guy, he doesn’t swing and miss a lot, who's going to hit somewhere between [...]280 and [...]300, hit 25 home runs. [...] He can run. I think he's going to be a really exciting player.|$|E
2500|$|Gabbidon {{went on to}} earn a {{place in}} the First Division team of the year in April 2004. Despite {{speculation}} during 2004 that Gabbidon might leave Cardiff City, Gabbidon signed an extension to his contract in September 2004, tying him to the club until 2008. Cardiff were prepared to offer him [...] "...the most lucrative contract ever offered to a Cardiff player", with club owner, Sam Hammam, saying, [...] "I want to make Danny Gabbidon a cornerstone of Cardiff City FC, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> as the absolute future of this football club personified." [...] The 2004–05 season saw Cardiff embroiled in a relegation battle {{in the first half of}} the season, something to which Gabbidon was unaccustomed. An unbeaten run in January 2005 however saw Cardiff lift themselves five points clear of the Championship relegation zone and Gabbidon named the Championship's player of the month. A financial crisis at Cardiff at the end of the season led to Gabbidon being unsure of his future at the club and he was sold to West Ham United in July 2005 to help cut the wage bill. On 4 July 2009 he played in the first ever game at the Cardiff City Stadium, an all-stars match.|$|E
