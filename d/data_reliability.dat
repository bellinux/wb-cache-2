30|$|To {{improve the}} product {{reliability}} in manufacturing and service processes, monitoring and evaluating <b>reliability</b> <b>data</b> are widely used. The <b>reliability</b> <b>data</b> have two main features which make the monitoring of such data complicated. The {{first one is}} that the <b>reliability</b> <b>data</b> often follow the specific parametric distributions, namely, location scale and log-location scale (Meeker and Escobar 1998). Among them, the lognormal, Weibull, and extreme value are the most commonly used distributions to model <b>reliability</b> <b>data</b> (Lawless 2003). The second issue {{is that it is not}} always possible to record the exact values of the <b>reliability</b> <b>data</b> due to the lack of time, resources or expenses. This problem makes us to consider the censoring as another property while dealing with <b>reliability</b> <b>data.</b> Furthermore, it would be more complicated when the variable-competing risk takes place.|$|R
40|$|Public {{transport}} offers affordable {{transport to}} many people every day. Due to material wear down, trains can break down and stop functioning. To prevent this from happening, modern technology {{can be used for}} condition monitoring to recognize material wear down and thus allowing trains to be mended in time. The Dutch Railways approached Logica {{to come up with a}} solu-tion that performs condition monitoring inside a train environment. Logica’s solution is the implementation of a wireless sensor network (WSN), where powered sensor nodes will be mounted as a linear ar-ray in a train compartment. These nodes will be used as a backbone network for data transport of certain train application sensor net-work, where <b>data</b> transport <b>reliability</b> is of major importance. This thesis project shows how a reliable sensor network can be es-tablished. This report discusses relevant terminology on sensor net-working, presents background information and quantifying models on <b>data</b> transport <b>reliability</b> and introduces relevant <b>data</b> transport <b>reliability</b> protocol solutions. Based on the train applications that will use the backbone network, this report shows what the relevant requirements are for establishing such a reliable data transport net-work. Based on these requirements, protocol solutions are selected that improve <b>data</b> transport <b>reliability.</b> Finally, the reliability and performance evaluation of a sensor net-work shows how the selected protocol solutions perform and in which way they contribute to <b>data</b> transport <b>reliability.</b> Reliable sensor network...|$|R

Hence, <b>data</b> transport <b>reliability</b> influences the quality of the analysis. Data aggregation is a common method used in sensor networks {{to reduce the amount of}} messages transported. By aggregating, the data contained in several messages is fused into one single message. Therefore, data aggregation significantly influences the overall <b>data</b> transport <b>reliability</b> observed at the sink.
