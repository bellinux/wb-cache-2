5|$|Usually males, {{mainly in}} {{polygynous}} species, have shorter lifespans than females. This {{can be attributed}} to several reasons: early <b>dispersal</b> <b>of</b> young males, aggressive male-male fights, vulnerability to predation (particularly when males are less agile, as in kudu), and malnutrition (being large in size, the male body has high nutritional requirements which may not be satisfied). Richard Despard Estes suggested that females mimic male secondary sexual characteristics like horns to protect their male offspring from dominant males. This feature seems to have been strongly selected to prevent male mortality and imbalanced sex ratios due to attacks by aggressive males and forced <b>dispersal</b> <b>of</b> young males during adolescence.|$|E

40|$|Dispersal is an {{ecological}} phenomenon {{which is of}} fundamental importance to population biology. While <b>dispersal</b> behaviour <b>of</b> many orders of winged insects has received a great deal <b>of</b> attention, the <b>dispersal</b> characteristics <b>of</b> odonates have been poorly documented. We used capture-mark-recapture techniques to study <b>dispersal</b> behaviour <b>of</b> seven species of odonates breeding on a network of 11 small ponds in Cheshire, U. K. The ponds ranged in size from 615 to 1300 m(2) and varied from 30 to 860 m apart.

40|$|Dispersal is {{a process}} of central {{importance}} for the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of populations and communities, because of its diverse consequences for gene flow and demography. It is subject to evolutionary change, which begs the question, what is the genetic basis of this potentially complex trait? To address this question, we (i) review the empirical literature on the genetic basis <b>of</b> <b>dispersal,</b> (ii) explore how theoretical investigations of the evolution <b>of</b> <b>dispersal</b> have represented the genetics <b>of</b> <b>dispersal,</b> and (iii) discuss how the genetic basis <b>of</b> <b>dispersal</b> influences theoretical predictions of the evolution <b>of</b> <b>dispersal</b> and potential consequences. Dispersal has a detectable genetic basis in many organisms, from bacteria to plants and animals. Generally, there is evidence for significant genetic variation for dispersal or dispersal-related phenotypes or evidence for the micro-evolution <b>of</b> <b>dispersal</b> in natural populations. Dispersal is typically the outcome of several interacting traits, and this complexity is reflected in its genetic architecture: while some genes of moderate to large effect can influence certain aspects <b>of</b> <b>dispersal,</b> dispersal traits are typically polygenic. Correlations among dispersal traits as well as between dispersal traits and other traits under selection are common, and the genetic basis <b>of</b> <b>dispersal</b> can be highly environment-dependent. By contrast, models have historically considered a highly simplified genetic architecture <b>of</b> <b>dispersal.</b> It is only recently that models have started to consider multiple loci influencing dispersal, as well as non-additive effects such as dominance and epistasis, showing that the genetic basis <b>of</b> <b>dispersal</b> can influence evolutionary rates and outcomes, especially under non-equilibrium conditions. For example, the number <b>of</b> loci controlling <b>dispersal</b> can influence projected rates <b>of</b> <b>dispersal</b> evolution during range shifts and corresponding demographic impacts. Incorporating more realism in the genetic architecture <b>of</b> <b>dispersal</b> is thus necessary to enable models to move beyond the purely theoretical towards making more useful predictions of evolutionary and ecological dynamics under current and future environmental conditions. To inform these advances, empirical studies need to answer outstanding questions concerning whether specific genes underlie dispersal variation, the genetic architecture <b>of</b> context-dependent <b>dispersal</b> phenotypes and behaviours, and correlations among dispersal and other traits...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDispersal plays a {{key role}} in the {{dynamics}} of ecological communities as it strongly determines the potential of individuals to colonize new habitats. Understanding and predicting species dispersal behaviour is therefore central to any effort at managing or even understanding the formation of communities. In this context, it is essential to understand the influence of environmental and biotic determinants <b>of</b> <b>dispersal.</b> In this work, we assessed these questions using earthworms as model organisms. We assessed the <b>dispersal</b> behaviour <b>of</b> six earthworm species belonging to two different functional groups (i. e. three anecics and three endogeics) in response to three key environmental factors: habitat quality, intraspecific density, and environment homogeneity. We found that habitat quality significantly influenced the <b>dispersal</b> rates <b>of</b> all species. Intraspecific density increased the <b>dispersal</b> rate <b>of</b> the three anecic species but only of one endogeic species. In a homogeneous environment, anecics dispersed further and in greater proportion than the majority of endogeics. Moreover, few anecic species have shown a tendency to follow conspecifics. Overall, anecic species seemed to have a higher active dispersal inclination than most endogeic ones. We found a high variability of our results within each functional groups, which suggests that this classification cannot be used to explain or predict the <b>dispersal</b> behaviour <b>of</b> earthworms...|$|R
40|$|Dispersal is a {{ubiquitous}} trait {{in living}} organisms.

We analyzed patchy populations of the weed Crepis sancta occupying small patches on sidewalks, around trees planted within the city of Montpellier (South of France), to investigate the recent evolutionary consequences of the cost <b>of</b> <b>dispersal.</b> C. sancta produces both dispersing and nondispersing seeds. First, we showed that, in urban patches, dispersing seeds have a 55 % lower chance of settling in their patch compared with nondispersing seeds and, thus, fall on a concrete matrix unsuitable for germination. Second, we showed that the proportion of nondispersing seeds in urban patches measured in a common environment is significantly higher than in surrounding, unfragmented populations. Third, by using a quantitative genetic model, we estimated that the pattern is consistent with short-term evolution that occurs over ≈ 5 – 12 generations of selection, which is generated by a high cost <b>of</b> <b>dispersal</b> in urban populations.
