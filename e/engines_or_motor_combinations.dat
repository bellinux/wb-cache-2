50|$|The {{drivetrain}} of a {{motor vehicle}} is the group of components that deliver power to the driving wheels. This excludes the <b>engine</b> <b>or</b> <b>motor</b> that generates the power. In contrast, the powertrain is considered to include both the <b>engine</b> <b>or</b> <b>motor</b> and the drivetrain.|$|R

50|$|The vehicle {{propulsion}} {{is provided}} by an <b>engine</b> <b>or</b> <b>motor,</b> usually by an internal combustion <b>engine,</b> <b>or</b> an electric <b>motor,</b> <b>or</b> some <b>combination</b> of the two, such as hybrid electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. For legal purposes motor vehicles are often identified within a number of vehicle classes including cars, buses, motorcycles, off-road vehicles, light trucks and regular trucks. These classifications {{vary according to the}} legal codes of each country. ISO 3833:1977 is the standard for road vehicles types, terms and definitions. Generally to avoid requiring handicapped persons from having to possess an operator's license to use one, or requiring tags and insurance, powered wheelchairs will be specifically excluded by law from being considered motor vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The non-stiffened Francis Rogallo parawing, the Domina Jalbert founded parafoil wing, {{or other}} {{modified}} fully flexible wings (Barish sailwing, KiteShip wing, parasails, modified conical parachutes) do not {{lend themselves to}} a mounting of a prime moving <b>engine</b> <b>or</b> <b>motor</b> to them; rather the kiting lines to the unpowered wing terminate below the wing to a static or mobile anchoring; that anchoring itself may be with its own active thrusting <b>engine</b> <b>or</b> <b>motor</b> <b>or</b> the anchor (which could be payload, pilot, or both payload and pilot) may simply fall by gravity force—and thus by gravity tug the wing through the ktie lines. When the payload or pilot is simply falling without adding a prime moving <b>engine</b> <b>or</b> <b>motor,</b> then the kited flexible wing is a paragliding wing; when the payload or pilot is additionally arranged with a thrust <b>engine</b> <b>or</b> <b>motor,</b> then the kited unpowered flexible wing with such thrusted payload or pilot is a powered aircraft system or powered paragliding system. The control systems are varied for particular applications (ranging from lowering military payloads, autonomous powered paragliders or drones, sport paragliding, sport powered paragliding, scale-model paragliding, scale-model powered paragliding). All variations have in common the unpowered kite {{whether or not the}} payload and/or pilot is powered.|$|R
5000|$|A thrust curve, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} a [...] "performance curve" [...] or [...] "thrust profile" [...] is a graph of the thrust of an <b>engine</b> <b>or</b> <b>motor,</b> (usually a rocket) with respect to time.|$|R
50|$|The {{power band}} of an {{internal}} combustion <b>engine</b> <b>or</b> electric <b>motor</b> is the range of operating speeds under which the <b>engine</b> <b>or</b> <b>motor</b> is able to operate most efficiently. While engines and motors have a large range of operating speeds, the power band is usually a much smaller range of engine speed, only half or less of the total engine speed range (electric motors are an exception—see the section on electric motors below).|$|R
50|$|Ground {{propulsion}} is any {{mechanism for}} propelling solid bodies along the ground, usually {{for the purposes}} of transportation. The propulsion system often consists of a <b>combination</b> of an <b>engine</b> <b>or</b> <b>motor,</b> a gearbox and wheel and axles in standard applications.|$|R
50|$|A {{technological}} {{system uses}} an <b>engine</b> <b>or</b> <b>motor</b> {{as the power}} source, and wheels and axles, propellers, or a propulsive nozzle to generate the force. Components such as clutches or gearboxes {{may be needed to}} connect the motor to axles, wheels, or propellors.|$|R

50|$|Thrust vectoring, also {{thrust vector}} control or TVC, {{is the ability of}} an aircraft, rocket, or other vehicle to {{manipulate}} the direction of the thrust from its <b>engine(s)</b> <b>or</b> <b>motor(s)</b> in order to control the attitude or angular velocity of the vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|A {{reaction}} engine is an <b>engine</b> <b>or</b> <b>motor</b> which provides thrust by expelling reaction mass, {{in accordance with}} Newton's third law of motion. This law of motion is most commonly paraphrased as: [...] "For every action force there is an equal, but opposite, reaction force".|$|R
50|$|Eco-modding is the {{reduction}} of drag, petroleum car adaptation to use renewable energy (generally, changing or adding a new <b>engine</b> <b>or</b> <b>motor),</b> generally hydrogen <b>or</b> electricity. See hybrid car. Occasionally, it {{has been known to}} run a Diesel engine on plant and animal oils. See Biodiesel.|$|R
25|$|Cable car is an American {{word for}} a {{passenger}} rail vehicle attached to a moving cable located below the street surface and powered by <b>engines</b> <b>or</b> <b>motors</b> at a central location, not on board the vehicle. There are cable cars operating in numerous cities, such as San Francisco, California.|$|R
50|$|The {{choice of}} {{propulsion}} {{can be either}} internal combustion <b>engine</b> <b>or</b> electric <b>motors</b> as with balsa counterparts.|$|R
50|$|Ice resurfacers are {{generally}} {{composed of a}} snow container, hot water tanks, a wash water tank, the conditioner, and a board brush. The <b>engine</b> <b>or</b> <b>motor</b> of the vehicle is responsible both for propelling the resurfacer and also powering the hydraulics that control the various functions, such as lowering the conditioner or raising the snow dump.|$|R
50|$|Amusement park go-karts can be {{powered by}} 4-stroke <b>engines</b> <b>or</b> {{electric}} <b>motors,</b> while racing karts use small 2-stroke <b>or</b> 4-stroke <b>engines.</b>|$|R

50|$|An <b>engine</b> <b>or</b> <b>motor</b> is {{a machine}} {{designed}} to convert {{one form of}} energy into mechanical energy. Heat engines burn a fuel to create heat, which is then {{used to create a}} force. Electric motors convert electrical energy into mechanical motion; pneumatic motors use compressed air and clockwork motors in wind-up toys use elastic energy. In biological systems, molecular motors, like myosins in muscles, use chemical energy to create forces and eventually motion.|$|R
50|$|Most {{successful}} early {{forms of}} self-propelled torpedoes used high pressure compressed air, although this was superseded by internal <b>or</b> external combustion <b>engines,</b> steam <b>engines,</b> <b>or</b> electric <b>motors.</b>|$|R
50|$|An <b>engine</b> <b>or</b> <b>motor</b> is {{a machine}} {{designed}} to convert energy into useful mechanical motion.

In biological systems, molecular motors like myosins in muscles use chemical energy to create motion.|$|R
5000|$|The saw chain, or [...] "cutting chain", {{is a key}} {{component}} of a chainsaw. It consists of steel links held together by rivets, and superficially resembles the bicycle-style roller chain, although it is closer in design to a leaf chain. Its key differences are sharp cutting teeth {{on the outside of the}} chain loop, and flat drive links on the inside, to retain the chain on the saw's bar and allow propulsion by the <b>engine</b> <b>or</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|R
40|$|Recent {{trend of}} railway train {{development}} {{can be characterized}} in several aspects : high speed, infortainment, intelligence in driving, and so on. In particular, trend of high speed in driving is prominent and competition for high speed amongst several techno-savvy countries is becoming severe. To achieve high speed, <b>engines</b> <b>or</b> <b>motors</b> are distributed over multiple vehicles of train to provide increased motive power, while a single <b>engine</b> <b>or</b> <b>motor</b> has been mostly used for conventional trains. Increased speed and more complicated powertrain system naturally incur much higher chance of massive accidents. From this perspective, importance of proactive safety control before accident takes place cannot be over-emphasized. To implement proactive safety control requires situation-aware integration and transmission of safety information obtained from IoT sensors. Types of critical IoT sensors depend on situational conditions. Thus, integration and transmission of safety information should be performed with IoT sensors providing the safety information proper for faced situation. This brief paper is to devise a methodology how to operate IoT sensor network enabling proactive safety control for railway vehicles and to propose a queue management based medium access control scheme.

50|$|Since the Quasiturbine {{is a pure}} {{expansion}} engine, {{while the}} Wankel and most other rotary engines are not, it is well-suited as a compressed fluid <b>engine,</b> air <b>engine</b> <b>or</b> air <b>motor.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Other {{components}} are often present; pumps (such as an injector) to supply {{water to the}} boiler during operation, condensers to recirculate the water and recover the latent heat of vaporisation, and superheaters to raise {{the temperature of the}} steam above its saturated vapour point, and various mechanisms to increase the draft for fireboxes. When coal is used, a chain or screw stoking mechanism and its drive <b>engine</b> <b>or</b> <b>motor</b> may be included to move the fuel from a supply bin (bunker) to the firebox. See: Mechanical stoker ...|$|R
50|$|Recreational karts can be {{powered by}} {{four-stroke}} <b>engines</b> <b>or</b> electric <b>motors,</b> while racing karts use a two-stroke or, rarely, higher powered four-stroke engines. Most {{of them are}} single seater but some recreational models can accommodate a passenger.|$|R
50|$|A {{jackshaft}} is {{an intermediate}} shaft used to transfer power from a powered shaft {{such as the}} output shaft of an <b>engine</b> <b>or</b> <b>motor</b> to driven shafts such as the drive axles of a locomotive. As applied railroad locomotives in the 19th and 20th centuries, jackshafts were typically {{in line with the}} drive axles of locomotives and connected to them by side rods. In general, each drive axle on a locomotive is free to move about one inch (2.5 cm) vertically relative to the frame, with the locomotive weight carried on springs. This means that if the <b>engine,</b> <b>motor</b> <b>or</b> transmission is rigidly attached to the locomotive frame, it cannot be rigidly connected to the axle. This problem can be solved by mounting the jackshaft on unsprung bearings and using side-rods or (in some early examples) chain drives.|$|R
50|$|The driving turbine, {{known as}} the 'pump', (or driving torus) is rotated by the prime mover, which is {{typically}} an internal combustion <b>engine</b> <b>or</b> electric <b>motor.</b> The impellor's motion imparts both outwards linear and rotational motion to the fluid.|$|R
50|$|Mopeds, {{electric}} bicycles, {{and even}} electric kick scooters are a simple {{form of a}} hybrid, powered by an internal combustion <b>engine</b> <b>or</b> electric <b>motor</b> and the rider's muscles. Early prototype motorcycles in the late 19th century used the same principle.|$|R
50|$|CPT is {{different}} from conventional Transport Vehicles as {{it does not have}} <b>engine</b> <b>or</b> <b>motor</b> on board. Cabins are propelled by off-board motor that moves the cable connected to a Bullwheel. Cabins are gripped with the cable. So, as the cable moves so does the cabin. The detachable types (MDG, BDG or 3S) can be detached at the station. There are usually two bull wheels, the bigger one is rotated by the motor, also called drive wheel, and the freely spinning small one at the other end. Deflection wheels can be incorporated that could alter the direction of cable.|$|R
50|$|A ridable {{miniature}} railway (US: 'riding railroad' or {{grand scale}} railroad) is a ground-level, large scale model railway that hauls passengers using locomotives that are models of full-sized railway locomotives (powered by diesel <b>or</b> petrol <b>engines,</b> live steam <b>engines</b> <b>or</b> electric <b>motors).</b>|$|R
25|$|Model yachts are {{operating}} craft, {{which may be}} sail, steam, <b>engine</b> <b>or</b> electric <b>motor</b> powered, typically resembling pleasure power craft, although the hobby also includes the construction and operation of models of working ships such as tugboats and other craft shown {{in this article as}} static models.|$|R
2500|$|... an <b>engine</b> <b>or</b> <b>motor</b> {{mounted in}} the frame (called a frame mount), under the frame, or behind the rider (called a rack mount) may drive the rear wheel via a {{sprocket}} with a chain or a rubber belt. This is called [...] "chain drive" [...] and [...] "belt drive" [...] respectively. Besides connecting the engine to a sprocket, the engine can also be connected directly to the crank. This is called [...] "crank drive" [...] or [...] "mid-drive" [...] and also allows incorporating the gears of the bicycle in the motorized system. Most of these bikes and kits are under 50cc {{and do not have}} to be registered in most states (the exception being the Whizzer NE5).|$|R
50|$|Here the {{unpowered}} kite is {{tethered to}} a pilot who arranges {{to have a}} harness to which is attached a thrusting prime moving <b>engine</b> <b>or</b> motor; the total system is a hang glider|powered aircraft while the kite itself remains unpowered (very differently is when an engine is mounted on a wing). The control system includes the control system of the similar system where the pilot is not thrusted by a harnessed prime moving <b>engine</b> <b>or</b> <b>motor,</b> however in controlling flight, adjustments for center of mass are respected. Further, while the pilot's thrust is on, the pilot positions so that the kite's kite line is angled so tugging of the wing is accomplished in the familiar kiting manner where the kite line begins upwind and angles upward downwind (relative wind {{is to be the}} wind in attention here).|$|R
5000|$|Outdoor tracks {{can offer}} low speed karts {{strictly}} for amusement (dedicated chassis equipped with low powered four-stroke <b>engines</b> <b>or</b> electric <b>motors),</b> <b>or</b> faster, more powerful karts, {{similar to a}} racing kart, powered by four-stroke engines up to [...] and, more rarely, by 2-stroke engines, but designed to be more robust for rental use. Typically, outdoor tracks are {{also be used for}} traditional kart races.|$|R
40|$|Molecules are in {{constant}} motion, if not frozen around 0 K, but their Brownian motion is random.
