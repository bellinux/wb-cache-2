5|$|A small {{fraction}} of the genes in an organism's genome control the organism's development. These genes are called the developmental-genetic toolkit. They are highly conserved among phyla, meaning that they are ancient and very similar in widely separated groups of animals. Differences in deployment of toolkit genes affect the body plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts. Most toolkit genes are parts of signalling pathways: they encode transcription factors, cell adhesion proteins, cell surface receptor proteins and signalling ligands that bind to them, and secreted morphogens that diffuse through the embryo. All of these help to define the fate of undifferentiated cells in the embryo. Together, they generate the patterns in time and space which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the body plan of the organism. Among the most important toolkit genes are the Hox genes.

5000|$|E-box binding {{proteins}} play a {{major role}} in regulating transcriptional activity. These proteins usually contain the basic helix-loop-helix protein structural motif, which allows them to bind as dimers. This motif consists of two amphipathic α-helices, separated by a small sequence of amino acids, that form one or more β-turns. The hydrophobic interactions between these α-helices stabilize dimerization. Besides, each bHLH monomer has a basic region, which helps mediate recognition between the bHLH monomer and the E-box (the basic region interacts with the major groove of the DNA). Depending on the <b>DNA</b> <b>motif</b> ("CAGCTG" [...] versus [...] "CACGTG") the bHLH protein has a different set of basic residues.|$|E

Perforation of the phagosome membrane mediated by ESX1 secretion system allows extracellular mycobacterial DNA to access host cytosolic DNA sensors, thus inducing the production of type I interferon in macrophages. High type I interferon signature leads to the M. tuberculosis pathogenesis and prolonged infection. STING-TBK1-IRF mediated type I interferon response is central to the pathogenesis of experimental cerebral malaria in laboratory animals infected with Plasmodium berghei. Laboratory mice deficient in type I interferon response are resistant to experimental cerebral malaria.|$|E

MyoD {{is known to have}} binding interactions with hundreds of muscular gene promoters and to permit myoblast proliferation. While not completely understood, MyoD is now thought to function as a major myogenesis controller in an on/off switch association mediated by KAP1 (KRAB associated box-associated protein 1) phosphorylation. KAP1 is localized at muscle-related genes in myoblasts along with both MyoD and Mef2 (a myocyte transcription enhancer factor). Here, it serves as a scaffold and recruits the coactivators p300 and LSD1, in addition to several corepressors which include G9a and the Histone deacetylase HDAC1. The consequence of this coactivator/corepressor recruitment is silenced promoting regions on muscle genes. When the kinase MSK1 phosphorylates KAP1, the corepressors previously bound to the scaffold are released allowing MyoD and Mef2 to activate transcription.|$|E

40|$|Bacterial {{chromosomes}} {{are organized}} in replichores of opposite sequence polarity. This conserved feature suggests {{a role in}} chromosome dynamics. Indeed, sequence polarity controls resolution of chromosome dimers in Escherichia coli. Chromosome dimers form by homologous recombination between sister chromosomes. They are resolved by the combined action of two tyrosine recombinases, XerC and XerD, acting at a specific chromosomal site, dif, and a DNA translocase, FtsK, which is anchored at the division septum and sorts chromosomal DNA to daughter cells. Evidences suggest that <b>DNA</b> <b>motifs</b> oriented from the replication origin towards dif provide FtsK with the necessary information to faithfully distribute chromosomal DNA {{to either side of}} the septum, thereby bringing the dif sites together {{at the end of this}} process. However, the nature of the <b>DNA</b> <b>motifs</b> acting as FtsK orienting polar sequences (KOPS) was unknown.

40|$|The {{circular}} polyomavirus genome is transcribed from divergent promoter regions. Early mRNAs are initiated from a {{transcription complex}} formed at a TATA motif, {{the site of}} binding of transcription factor TFIID. Early transcription is promoted at a distance by the viral enhancer, which includes <b>DNA</b> <b>motifs</b> bound by cellular proteins of the PEA 1 and PEA 3 families of transcription activators. In contrast, the predominant viral late mRNAs are initiated within the viral enhancer, which lacks a TATA motif, near the PEA 1 and PEA 3 <b>DNA</b> <b>motifs.</b> Here, we demonstrate that these PEA 1 and PEA 3 binding sites are primary components of an autonomous transcription initiator element (Inr). They cause transcription of most polyomavirus late mRNAs and can direct the transcription of heterologous reporter genes.

In this paper, we present a computational method to connect novel transcription factors and <b>DNA</b> <b>motifs</b> in E. coli.

40|$|Motivation: The protein-DNA {{interactions}} between transcription factors (TFs) and transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs, {{also known as}} DNA motifs) are critical activities in gene transcription. The identification of the DNA motifs is a vital task for downstream analysis. Unfortunately, the long-range coupling information between different DNA motifs is still lacking. To fill the void, as the first-of-its-kind study, we have identified the coupling <b>DNA</b> <b>motif</b> pairs on long-range chromatin interactions in human. Results: The coupling <b>DNA</b> <b>motif</b> pairs exhibit substantially higher DNase accessibility than the background sequences. Half of the DNA motifs involved are matched to the existing motif databases, although {{nearly all of them}} are enriched with at least one gene ontology term. Their motif instances are also found statistically enriched on the promoter and enhancer regions. Especially, we introduce a novel measurement called motif pairing multiplicity which is defined as the number of motifs that are paired with a given motif on chromatin interactions. Interestingly, we observe that motif pairing multiplicity is linked to several characteristics such as regulatory region type, motif sequence degeneracy, DNase accessibility and pairing genomic distance. Taken into account together, we believe the coupling <b>DNA</b> <b>motif</b> pairs identified in this study can shed lights on the gene transcription mechanism under long-range chromatin interactions. © The Author 2015.

30|$|DNA is a {{remarkable}} molecule that stores all the genetic information required for proper functioning and reproduction of living organisms. The important feature of DNA is the capability of molecular recognition through the Watson–Crick base paring, in which, through hydrogen bonding, Adenine (A) binds specifically to Thymine (T) and Guanine (G) to Cytosine (C). In addition, the DNA is a nanoscale molecule; for double-helical B-DNA, the diameter is about 2 nm and its helical pitch is about 3.4 nm [140 – 142]. The molecular recognition capability of DNA {{as well as its}} nanoscale dimension has been utilized as a powerful tool for programmed arrangement of various nanoscale building blocks. The key to this approach is to design <b>DNA</b> <b>motifs</b> that contain molecular recognition parts which can specifically combine with other <b>DNA</b> <b>motifs</b> in a selective and programmable manner. Conjugating nanoscale building blocks such as nanoparticles, proteins, ions, and organic/inorganic molecules with the <b>DNA</b> <b>motifs</b> can lead to the well-defined arrangement of nanoscale building blocks. This DNA-programmed assembly of nanoscale building blocks is a fascinating emerging field with high potential for bottom-up construction of nanoscale devices and sensors. Here we present several examples of recent successful studies. The interested reader may also look at excellent reviews and the references therein [140 – 150]. In this section, we first introduce DNA-assisted assembly using single-stranded DNA (ss-DNA), which leads to formation of linear arrays of nanoscale building blocks. We then briefly describe the key aspects of artificial <b>DNA</b> <b>motifs</b> (<b>DNA</b> tiles), which are more rigid than ordinary DNA, can be assembled into crystals, and are suitable as scaffolding for nanoscale building blocks. We then review programmed assembly of nanoscale building blocks that utilize DNA crystals as scaffolds. Several successful studies will be presented as examples.|$|R
