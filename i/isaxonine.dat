40|$|Administration of <b>isaxonine</b> (6 mg/kg {{powdered}} diet) had {{no effect}} on regeneration following sciatic nerve crush in the rat. In 10 patients undergoing treatment with vincristine (1. 4 mg/m 2 twice monthly) development of peripheral neuropathy was quantitated by neurological symptoms, signs and electrophysiological tests. Five also received <b>isaxonine</b> (1. 5 g daily). All patients developed evidence of neuropathy, but in none was it severe. The three lowest disability scores were obtained in <b>isaxonine</b> treated patients, but the highest score was also in an <b>isaxonine</b> treated patient. The equivocal findings in this small study could not be amplified because the drug was withdrawn from clinical use on account of its hepatotoxicity...|$|E
40|$|Coincubation of 0. 4 mM [3 H]{{glutathione}} with 4 mM <b>isaxonine,</b> an NADPH-generating system, glutathione S-transferase {{and mouse}} liver microsomes, followed by thin-layer chromatography of the incubation mixture, {{resulted in the}} appearance of a labeled peak with characteristics consistent with a glutathione-isaxonine metabolite adduct: this peak was absent if either <b>isaxonine</b> or the NADPH-generating system was omitted and was decreased if the transferase was omitted. In vivo, the concentrations of hepatic glutathione and glutathione disulfide were markedly decreased 2. 5 hr after administration of <b>isaxonine</b> (4 mmol. kg i. p.); this depletion of glutathione was prevented essentially by pretreatment with piperonyl butoxide. In vitro, addition of 4 mM glutathione decreased markedly the amount of 1 â€™ 4 Clisaxonine metabolite that bound to microsomal protein...|$|E
40|$|<b>Isaxonine</b> {{phosphate}} (isopropylamino- 2 -pyrimidine phosphate), a neurotrophic agent, {{was tested}} on Schwann cell and muscle metabolism {{as evidenced by}} radiophosphate uptake in the inorganic phosphate and organic-bound aacid-soluble phosphate fractions. It had no demonstrable effect either on sciatic nerve Schwann cells above and below an experimental crush or on the corresponding gastrocnemius and soleus muscles in their denervated and reinnervated state (7 th to 28 th postoperative day). It also failed to influence the end results (150 th postoperative day) at nerve and muscle level after surgical division of the nerve and repair by either microsuture or fibrinogen adhesive.
