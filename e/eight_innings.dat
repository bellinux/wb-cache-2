5|$|Macartney had a {{quiet time}} over the next month, passing fifty only once in the next <b>eight</b> <b>innings</b> in seven matches. He also ended his wicket-taking drought, {{claiming}} six in three matches after almost two months without success. He returned to form with 72 against Warwickshire and 155 in the next match against Kent.|$|E
5|$|On July 6, 2010 at Miller Park, in a 6-1 {{win over}} the Milwaukee Brewers, Bumgarner earned his first career victory by going <b>eight</b> <b>innings</b> without {{yielding}} a run. Bumgarner pitched well enough that when Wellemeyer returned from the disabled list in August, Giants' manager Bruce Bochy chose to use him in the bullpen and leave Bumgarner in the rotation.|$|E
5|$|On June 24, Jake Peavy {{surrendered}} three earned runs in five innings, {{which caused}} his ERA {{to rise from}} 1.98 to 2.14. This gave Young, who had a 2.08 ERA, the National League-leading average for one day. The next day, Brad Penny allowed only one earned run over <b>eight</b> <b>innings</b> {{to take the lead}} with a 2.04 ERA.|$|E

5|$|The Athletics {{made the}} postseason and again played the Yankees in the ALDS. Zito pitched in Game 3 against Mike Mussina. He went <b>eight</b> <b>innings,</b> {{striking}} out six, walking one, and allowing an earned run. But Zito took the loss as the Yankees won the game, 1–0. The Yankees {{would end up}} taking the series, 3–2.|$|E
5|$|Nova entered spring {{training}} in 2011 expected {{to secure a}} spot in the starting rotation. Nova was named to the Yankees' starting rotation. On June 20, Nova had the longest start in his career (at that time), allowing one run in <b>eight</b> <b>innings</b> against the Cincinnati Reds, while striking out seven. Through June, Nova had an 8–4 win–loss record and 4.15 ERA, including a 4–1 record and 3.35 ERA in his six most recent starts.|$|E
5|$|Orioles' {{starting}} pitcher Scott Erickson allowed one run on five hits in seven innings pitched. Cuban starter José Ibar allowed {{a home run}} to Charles Johnson and was relieved {{in the third inning}} by José Contreras. Contreras pitched <b>eight</b> <b>innings</b> without allowing a run. Orioles' manager Dave Miller brought in his closer, Mike Timlin, in the eighth inning. This backfired, as Omar Linares tied the game for Cuba with a run batted in single.|$|E

5|$|Beckett {{started the}} first game of the 2007 American League Championship Series (ALCS) and pitched six innings for the win and in game five he struck out 11 in <b>eight</b> <b>innings.</b> Beckett's 2–0 record and 1.93 ERA against the Cleveland Indians earned him the 2007 ALCS MVP Award. He then started and won {{the first game}} of the 2007 World Series against the Colorado Rockies, {{pitching}} seven innings, allowing one run on six hits, and striking out nine batters. Boston would go on to sweep the Rockies in the series.|$|E
5|$|Bobby Bragan {{replaced}} Farrell {{as manager}} {{to begin the}} 1958 season. During a spring training game in March, Garcia slipped on a wet pitcher's mound and injured his back. He did not make his first regular season appearance until April 27 and he underwent surgery in June for a herniated disc. He finished {{the season with a}} 1–0 record in six appearances and <b>eight</b> <b>innings</b> of work. That same month, Bragan was fired as manager. He was replaced by former Indians player Joe Gordon, and the Indians finished 77–76.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies' offense {{benefited from}} rest {{due to the}} {{postponement}} of {{the final game of}} the Padres' series, as they defeated the Milwaukee Brewers in the opener of their mid-week series, 11–4. The next two games did not go as smoothly, as the Phillies were shut out through <b>eight</b> <b>innings</b> in the second game and nearly no-hit by Brewers starter Dave Bush in the third game. Phillies starter Cole Hamels was hit by a line drive in the fourth inning and exited the game; before departing, he had retired nine out of the ten batters he faced. Hitting the road for a series against the division-leading Florida Marlins, the Phillies were shut out through <b>eight</b> <b>innings</b> in {{the first game of the}} series, only to score seven runs in the top of the ninth against power-throwing closer Matt Lindstrom, winning the game, 7–3, thanks to Shane Victorino's first career regular season grand slam. The following night's game offered another come-from-behind win for the Phillies, as they trailed in the ninth again to win in extra innings, 6–4, and the 13–2 victory on April 26 capped the team's first series sweep. Hosting Washington for their second series against the Nationals, the Phillies fell behind in the seventh inning before a grand slam by Ibáñez capped their 13–11 victory; combined with Ryan Howard's game-tying grand slam in the fifth inning, this was only the fourth time in Phillies history that teammates hit grand slams in the same game. The Phillies split the remaining two games of the series with Washington, finishing with an April record of 11–9, their second consecutive winning April.|$|E

5|$|With the {{retirement}} of Hassett following the 1953 England tour, the Australian captaincy was open for competition. No international cricket was scheduled until 1954–55, {{so there was a}} full domestic season in 1953–54 for players to stake their claims. Morris started strongly with consecutive centuries against Queensland and South Australia, but was unable to maintain his form, passing fifty only twice in his remaining <b>eight</b> <b>innings.</b> He ended with 487 runs at 54.11 as New South Wales won the Sheffield Shield under Miller's leadership. Nevertheless, the Australian selectors indicated that they were considering Morris as a captaincy option by making him captain of Morris' XI, which played Hassett's XI in a testimonial match. Morris' XI won by 121 runs.|$|E
5|$|Woodfull {{started his}} final English {{campaign}} slowly. In his first <b>eight</b> <b>innings,</b> he scored only 161 runs at 20.12 with one half-century. Other players sensed that Woodfull had become less cheerful following the bodyline series and {{he offered to}} drop himself following his run of poor form, but fellow selectors Bradman and Alan Kippax disagreed. In the traditional Test rehearsal against the MCC, Australia reduced the hosts to be eight down in their second innings, still in arrears when the match ended in a draw. In his final innings before the Tests, Woodfull struck form with 172 not out against Lancashire.|$|E
5|$|After {{recovering}} from the rib injury, Hughes pitched for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre; he helped them win the 2008 International League title, earning the win after striking out 12 batters in the clinching game. On September 13, {{a day after the}} IL playoffs, Hughes was recalled by the Yankees. On September 17, Hughes made his first start since April 29, giving up one earned run over four innings and earning a no-decision in a 5–1 victory over the Chicago White Sox. In his final start of the season, on September 24, he gave up two runs in <b>eight</b> <b>innings</b> and received a no-decision in a ten-inning, 6–2 victory over Toronto. He finished the season with an 0–4 record, a 6.62 ERA, 23 strikeouts, and 34 innings pitched in eight starts. Because injuries severely limited his workload during the season, the Yankees sent Hughes to the Arizona Fall League after the season to pitch more innings.|$|E

5000|$|May 14: Struggling starter Brad Penny righted {{himself with}} <b>eight</b> shutout <b>innings,</b> as the Tigers won their seventh straight, 3-0 over the Royals. Closer José Valverde {{picked up his}} 10th save in 10 opportunities.|$|R
50|$|Lester started Game 1 of the 2016 NLDS {{against the}} San Francisco Giants. He earned the win after tossing <b>eight</b> {{scoreless}} <b>innings,</b> the Cubs {{would go on}} and win the series 3 games to 1.|$|R
5|$|Australia {{headed into}} the First Test at Trent Bridge with ten wins and two draws from twelve tour matches, {{including}} <b>eight</b> <b>innings</b> victories. England captain Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat. Pundits predicted that the pitch would be ideal for batting after offering some assistance to fast bowlers in the first hour. The surface had greened up following overnight rain. Australia's fast bowlers reduced England to 8/74 before finishing them off for 165 late on the first day. The tourists had already taken the lead by the time Hassett came in to join Bradman at 4/185 on the second afternoon. The hard-hitting Miller had come in at No. 4, the more Hassett's usual position, indicating that Bradman may have been looking to attack, but the change in batting order failed as Miller was out for a duck.|$|E
5|$|Hansen {{earned his}} first win a week later, an 8–3 {{victory over the}} Philadelphia Phillies on July 16. The victory came in relief of Frank Seward, who started the game but pitched only one inning. He pitched four innings, {{allowing}} only one run; Ace Adams followed with four scoreless innings and earned the save. His fourth decision, a second career victory, did not come until July 31, when he defeated future teammate Jim Konstanty in a 9–7 victory over the Cincinnati Reds. Hansen appeared again in a relief role, but pitched <b>eight</b> <b>innings</b> of one-run ball after starter Bill Voiselle allowed six runs in the game's first inning. At the plate, Hansen got his first major-league hit and scored his second career run while striking out once.|$|E
5|$|The no-hitter {{cemented}} Holloman's spot in {{the starting}} rotation for the next month. In his next start against the Athletics, he lasted barely an inning, allowing two runs and three walks before leaving the game due to a blistered finger. His next win came on May 28 against the Cleveland Indians, but his third win did not come until a month later against the Boston Red Sox, where he allowed two hits in <b>eight</b> <b>innings</b> of work. Outside of the three wins, however, Holloman was ineffective; in 22 games, 10 of them starts, Holloman had a 3–7 record with a 5.23 ERA, 25 strikeouts, and 50 walks. As a result, after his final appearance on July 19, the Browns put him on waivers, and he was sold to the Toronto Maple Leafs.|$|E
50|$|Choate's only Major League service came in September 1960 {{when he was}} {{recalled}} {{from the}} Triple-A Tacoma Giants. In <b>eight</b> MLB <b>innings</b> pitched, he gave up two earned runs, seven hits and four bases on balls, with seven strikeouts.|$|R
50|$|He {{made his}} major league debut in relief on April 28, 1995, against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Schmidt {{recorded}} his first ML victory {{in his first}} start, pitching <b>eight</b> scoreless <b>innings</b> against the Chicago Cubs on September 3, 1995.|$|R
50|$|Reds starter Don Gullett {{held the}} Phils to two hits in <b>eight</b> strong <b>innings</b> and helped his own cause with an RBI {{single in the}} sixth and a two-run double in the eighth. George Foster added a solo homer.|$|R
5|$|The only run of {{the game}} scored when White Sox {{designated}} hitter Jim Thome led off {{the bottom of the}} seventh inning with a solo home run. Blackburn got Paul Konerko to ground out, but allowed a double to Griffey and, following an intentional walk to Alexei Ramírez, José Mijares relieved him. John Danks lasted through <b>eight</b> <b>innings</b> without allowing a run and was relieved by closer Bobby Jenks in the ninth. Jenks recorded three outs, securing the White Sox' 1–0 victory with his 30th save of the season. Twins batters Joe Mauer, Justin Morneau, and Cuddyer had a combined 22 hits in 40 at-bats (.550 batting average) against Danks for their careers but in the tie-breaker they combined to go 1–for-9 (.111) with 3 strikeouts. This game saw the lowest combined score of any tie-breaker game in MLB history, three runs lower than the 3–1 score of {{the first game of the}} 1951 National League tie-breaker series.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{signing a}} {{contract}} with the Yankees, Wensloff spent the 1943 season on the Yankees' major league roster. During spring training, Yankees manager Joe McCarthy had heard impressive things about Wensloff, though he had not seen him pitch often. Wensloff made his major league debut for the Yankees on May 2, 1943 against the Washington Senators. In his debut, the second game of a doubleheader, he allowed four earned runs and seven hits in <b>eight</b> <b>innings</b> as the Yankees lost, 41. He won his first game in his next pitching appearance on May 7, 1943 against the Philadelphia Athletics, allowing no walks and six hits in a 62 victory. By the end of June, he had six complete games in his first six starts. However, he was not receiving the publicity other rookies were, such as pitcher Jesse Flores, and had four wins and four losses despite how well he had been pitching.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{headed into}} the First Test at Trent Bridge {{starting}} on 10 June with ten wins and two draws from twelve tour matches, with <b>eight</b> <b>innings</b> victories. It was thought that Bradman would play a specialist leg spinner, but {{he changed his mind}} on the first morning when rain was forecast. Bill Johnston, a left-arm paceman and orthodox spinner, was played in the hope of exploiting a wet wicket. This was the only change from the teams that Australia had fielded in the matches against Worcestershire and the MCC. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat. Pundits predicted that the pitch would be ideal for batting apart from some assistance to fast bowlers in the first hour, as the surface of the pitch had become moist following overnight rain, assisting seam bowling. Australia's selection policy meant that their reserve opener Brown would bat out of position in the middle order while Barnes and Morris opened, while Neil Harvey was dropped despite making a century in Australia's most recent Test against India.|$|E
50|$|Anderson {{also played}} in one Twenty20 Cup match in June 2003 for Northamptonshire, having also {{represented}} Essex during two non-consecutive tenures throughout a short career. In total, throughout his career, he made <b>eight</b> five-wicket <b>innings,</b> and bowled one ten-wicket match.|$|R
50|$|In six total games {{pitched in}} the big leagues, all in relief, Brittin had a 0-0 record with a 6.75 earned run average. He allowed seven hits, six earned runs and nine bases on balls in <b>eight</b> full <b>innings</b> pitched.|$|R
50|$|Paul was a {{right-handed}} batsman and a wicketkeeper, {{though in}} one match {{he played in}} for Somerset in the 1910 season he did not keep wicket. He made only 37 runs in <b>eight</b> first-class <b>innings</b> and took just two catches.|$|R
