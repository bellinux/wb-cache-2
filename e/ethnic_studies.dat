25|$|One of the {{developments}} in late-20th-century American literature was {{the increase of}} literature written by and about ethnic minorities beyond African Americans and Jewish Americans. This development came alongside {{the growth of the}} Civil Rights movements and its corollary, the Ethnic Pride movement, which {{led to the creation of}} <b>Ethnic</b> <b>Studies</b> programs in most major universities. These programs helped establish the new ethnic literature as worthy objects of academic study, alongside such other new areas of literary study as women's literature, gay and lesbian literature, working-class literature, postcolonial literature, and the rise of literary theory as a key component of academic literary study.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, at President Lynch's urging, {{the college}} {{established}} its first doctorate program, offering a Ph.D. in Criminal Justice {{on the heels}} of several Master's programs.

John Jay continued to pursue an approach to education more attuned to the liberal arts. The college supported more curricular cultural diversity, establishing an <b>Ethnic</b> <b>Studies</b> track and strengthening its Women's Studies program. Between 1985 and 1988, as faculty pursued more research opportunities, the amount of grant money given to John Jay faculty increased by over 500%.|$|E
