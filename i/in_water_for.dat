5|$|Breaking the day's fasting {{traditionally}} {{begins with}} the brief consumption of dates and a chilled beverage. Palestinians make a variety of fruit-based beverages, including the flavors, tamar Hindi or tamarind, sous or licorice, kharroub or carob and Qamar Eddine. Tamar Hindi is made by soaking tamarinds <b>in</b> <b>water</b> <b>for</b> many hours, then straining, sweetening and mixing it with rose water and lemon juice. Kharroub is made similarly except instead of tamarind, carob is used. Qamar Eddine is made of dried apricots boiled into a liquid and chilled.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{supplied}} divers may {{be supplied}} with a gas mixture suitable for accelerated decompression by connecting a {{supply to the}} surface gas panel and connecting it through the valve system to the divers. This allows accelerated decompression, usually on oxygen, {{which can be used}} to a maximum depth of 20ft (6m) <b>in</b> <b>water</b> <b>for</b> scuba and 30ft (9m) on surface supply. Surface supplied heliox bounce divers will be provided with mixtures suitable for their current depth, and the mixture may be changed several times during descent and ascent from great depths.|$|E

5|$|After a lahar {{demolished}} her home, Sánchez became pinned {{beneath the}} debris of her house, where she remained trapped <b>in</b> <b>water</b> <b>for</b> three days. Her plight was documented as she descended from calmness into agony. Her courage and dignity touched journalists and relief workers, who put great efforts into comforting her. After 60 hours of struggling, she died, likely {{as a result of}} either gangrene or hypothermia. Her death highlighted the failure of officials to respond correctly to the threat of the volcano, contrasted with the efforts of volunteer rescue workers to reach and treat trapped victims, despite inadequate supplies and equipment.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Katrina {{entered the}} Gulf of Mexico and was heading towards Louisiana. For precaution, Six Flags closed down the New Orleans theme park during mid-season {{to prepare for}} the storm. Due to {{substantial}} flooding, many of the park's rides were damaged beyond repair causing the park to remain closed until the floods retrieved. Many of the park rides were destroyed as the park's drainage system failed and were submerged <b>in</b> <b>water</b> <b>for</b> a long period of time, long after the hurricane. Anything found in the park still in good use was removed and moved to other parks in the company as Six Flags had no plans on reopening the theme park. Batman: The Ride survived, mainly because of its elevated station and corrosion-resistant support structure, which caused it to make it through Hurricane Katrina relatively unscathed.|$|E

5|$|The {{coconut crab}} {{is the only}} species of the genus Birgus, and {{is related to the}} {{terrestrial}} hermit crabs of the genus Coenobita. It shows a number of adaptations to life on land. Like hermit crabs, juvenile coconut crabs use empty gastropod shells for protection, but the adults develop a tough exoskeleton on their abdomen and stop carrying a shell. Coconut crabs have organs known as branchiostegal lungs, which are used instead of the vestigial gills for breathing and they will drown if immersed <b>in</b> <b>water</b> <b>for</b> long. They have an acute sense of smell, which has developed convergently with that of insects, and which they use to find potential food sources.|$|E

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of three pre-germination treatments in breaking dormancy {{of the seeds}} of Di-alum guineense and effects of three watering regimes on the growth performance of the seedlings were investigated. The pre-germination treatments were: soaking <b>in</b> hot <b>water</b> <b>for</b> 10 seconds and cooling down <b>in</b> cold <b>water</b> (T 1), soaking <b>in</b> cold <b>water</b> <b>for</b> 24 hours (T 2), soaking <b>in</b> running <b>water</b> <b>for</b> 48 hours (T 3) and control (T 4), while watering regimes include: <b>watering</b> once daily <b>in</b> the morning (W 1), watering once every two days in the morning (W 2) and watering once every three days in the morning (W 3). The results showed that germination occurred first at 5 days after sow-ing (5 DAS) among the seeds soaked <b>in</b> cold <b>water</b> <b>for</b> 24 hours before sowing (T 2), while the un-treated seeds (control) took the longest period of 12 days before germination occurred.
