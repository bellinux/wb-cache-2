500|$|When the {{producers}} were auditioning actors for roles in Lost, Harold Perrineau {{was in the}} area. The producers called it a [...] "natural move" [...] to have him audition. Although initially skeptical about the show, he took the role when Lost creator J. J. Abrams explained more about it. Perrineau was attracted to the role because [...] "'s a guy that's {{in a lot of}} conflict and we're not <b>exactly</b> <b>sure</b> why". In season one, Michael was {{going to be part of}} a love triangle with Sun and Jin, however this was dropped after positive fan reaction to Sun and Jin's relationship. The storyline is revisited in the [...] mobisode [...] "Buried Secrets", which shows Michael and Sun almost kissing. Michael and Jin were going to be enemies throughout all of the season, but {{the producers}} felt Perrineau and Daniel Dae Kim had good chemistry, so the storyline was changed to them becoming friends. Perrineau called filming the first season [...] "one of [...] best years as a working actor".|$|E

When Jeff Gordon has a good car {{and he has the}} opportunity to beat you, he's going to beat you. He's my hero. I've always watched him and what he's been able to accomplish over the years." [...] In the subsequent press conference, pole position winner, Edwards, stated his frustration at his accident, [...] "I’m not <b>exactly</b> <b>sure</b> what happened. I’ll have to talk to Kyle about it. I thought at first he was just frustrated and he turned left to get back in line and he didn’t know I was there, but I watched the tape and I think he really did get loose. He hit me hard and I was left with nothing. I got rammed to the infield." [...] Rick Hendrick, the owner of Hendrick Motorsports, expressed his enjoyment of winning the race, stating, [...] "When you're a champion like Jeff Gordon, you know you can still do it, (even) when people overlook you. He's been right there but he hasn't had that edge. I think we're {{going to see a lot}} of momentum out of that team right now." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1971, for {{the first}} time, the Assay Commission had no silver coins to test; none were struck by the Mint for {{circulation}} in 1970. [...] Although part-silver Kennedy half dollars were struck in 1970, they were only for collectors and were not put aside for assay. Commissioners could instead test 21,975 dimes and 11,098 quarters, all made from copper-nickel clad, though as the Associated Press, reporting on the 1973 Assay Commission, put it, [...] "a discovery of a bum coin hasn't occurred in years." [...] Only one in every 100,000 clad or silver-clad pieces was put aside for the Assay Commission, and only one in every 200,000 dimes. [...] At the 1974 meeting, one copper-nickel Eisenhower dollar was discovered which weighed [...] below specification; after reference to the rules, the coin was deemed barely within guidelines. [...] Numismatist Charles Logan, in his 1979 article about the impending end of the Assay Commission, stated that this incident pointed out [...] "the basic problem with the annual trial. First, the members were not <b>exactly</b> <b>sure</b> how their job was done, or what the requirements were. [...] Second, they really {{did not want to}} report a fault in the coinage. [...] Finally, even if the one dollar coin had been found faulty, [...] little consequence, except to prompt greater vigilance at the Mint." ...|$|E
500|$|Neighbours {{was created}} in the early-to-mid-1980s by Australian TV {{executive}} Reg Watson. Watson decided to create a soap opera after working on Crossroads and seeing how successful it and Coronation Street were in Britain. He had already created such successful Australian made soap operas as The Young Doctors, Prisoner and Sons and Daughters. Watson proposed the idea of making a show that would focus on more realistic stories and portray teens and adults who talk openly to each other and solve their problems together. Watson, who worked for the Grundy production company, decided to make his show appeal to both Australia and Britain. In 2005, Darren Devlyn and Caroline Frost from the Herald Sun reported that Watson then took his idea to the Nine Network in 1982, but it was rejected. Former Network Nine chief executive Ian Johnson commented {{that it was one of}} the [...] "biggest missed opportunities" [...] in his twenty-four years at the network. He added [...] "I remember it being discussed, but I'm not <b>exactly</b> <b>sure</b> what went against it. It may have had something to do with the fact we'd picked up Sale of the Century with Tony Barber in 1980 and it was doing huge business, so we didn't have a pressing need for a five-night-a-week show." [...] Watson then took his idea to the Seven Network, who commissioned the show, following the success of his other Seven Network soap opera, Sons and Daughters. Several titles for the show were discussed, including People Like Us, One Way Street, No Through Road and Living Together until the network programmers voted on Neighbours. The first episode was broadcast on 18 March 1985 and reviews for the show were favourable. However, the Melbourne-produced programme underperformed in the Sydney market and after a meeting of the general managers, Seven decided to drop the show in October 1985. Seven's Melbourne programme boss, Gary Fenton said Sydney chief Ted Thomas told the other general managers that Seven could not afford three dramas and argued that the Sydney-based A Country Practice and Sons and Daughters be retained.|$|E

Admitting the podcast was funded from This American Lifes budget during the launch, producer Koenig noted that Serial would eventually need to generate its own funding.

2500|$|Like {{the other}} players in the Heartbreakers, Campbell avoids the virtuoso {{approach}} to playing, preferring to have his work {{serve the needs of}} each song. Guitar World magazine noted [...] "there are only a handful of guitarists who can claim to have never wasted a note. Mike Campbell is certainly one of them". He is a highly melodic player, often using two or three-strings-at-a-time leads instead of the more conventional one-at-a-time approach. [...] "People have told me that my playing sounds like bagpipes," [...] he muses. [...] "I'm not <b>exactly</b> <b>sure</b> what that means." [...] His estimation of his own style is typically modest: [...] "I don't think people can really top Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton as far as lead guitar goes. I like my playing to bring out the songs." [...] Like Tench, he is heavily involved in constructing the arrangements for the Heartbreakers' tunes. And also like Tench, he prefers rawness to polish in the studio and onstage.|$|E
2500|$|Soil {{can have}} a {{significant}} impact on the potential quality of wine. While geologist and viticulturist are not <b>exactly</b> <b>sure</b> what type of immutable or terroir based qualities that soil can impart on wine, there is near universal agreement that a soil's water retention and drainage abilities play a primary role. Water retention refers to the soil's ability to hold water. The term [...] "field capacity" [...] is used to describe the maximum amount of water that deeply moistened soil will retain after normal drainage. Drainage is the ability of water to move freely throughout the soil. The ideal circumstance is soil that can retain sufficient amount of water for the grapevine but drains well enough to where the soil doesn't become water-logged. Soil that doesn't retain water well encourages the vine to easily sleep into water stress while soil that doesn't drain well runs of the risk of water-logged roots being attacked by microbial agents that consume all the soil nutrients and end up starving the vine.|$|E
2500|$|As Governor of Massachusetts, Romney {{supported}} {{the teaching of}} evolution, and opposed the teaching of intelligent design, in public school science classes, stating so in December 2005 during his term, and then in May 2007 – shortly after his term concluded – saying, [...] "In my opinion, the science class is where to teach evolution, or if there are other scientific thoughts {{that need to be}} discussed. If we’re going to talk about more philosophical matters, like why it was created, and was there an intelligent designer behind it, that’s for the religion class or philosophy class or social studies class." [...] Romney expressed his own views in May 2007 by saying, [...] "I believe that God designed the universe and created the universe. And I believe evolution is most likely the process he used to create the human body. ... I’m not <b>exactly</b> <b>sure</b> what is meant by intelligent design. But I believe God is intelligent and I believe he designed the creation. And I believe he used the process of evolution to create the human body." [...] He said that when faculty members interviewing him for an honors designation asked for his beliefs on the subject before his 1971 graduation from Brigham Young University, he told them that there was [...] " [...] between true science and true religion". [...] At a May 2007 Republican Party presidential debate, Romney was not one of several candidates that raised their hands to indicate they did not accept evolution.|$|E
