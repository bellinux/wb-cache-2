5|$|Few {{tasks were}} left to {{complete}} when the 1977 construction season began. Most of the pump stations had been turned over to operating personnel by construction workers, and environmental mitigation and cleanup {{was in full swing}} as Alyeska repaired tundra damage caused by construction. Associated-Green, which had performed its construction tasks well, was assigned the job of finishing the final touches on the main pipeline. The last 160 miles of <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>testing</b> were done, 33 remedial welds were completed, and 45 miles of pipe were insulated, among other tasks. Because the pace of construction was much slower than in 1976, fewer workers were needed. Fewer than 11,000 were employed at the peak of 1977 work, about half of 1976's total. On May 31, the final pipeline weld took place.|$|E

5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} may {{be manufactured}} from steel plate discs, which are cold {{drawn to a}} cylindrical cup form, {{in two or three}} stages, and generally have a domed base if intended for the scuba market, so they cannot stand up by themselves. After forming the base and side walls, the top of the cylinder is trimmed to length, heated and hot spun to form the shoulder and close the neck. This process thickens the material of the shoulder. The cylinder is heat-treated by quenching and tempering to provide the best strength and toughness. The cylinders are machined to provide the neck thread and o-ring seat (if applicable), then chemically cleaned or shot-blasted inside and out to remove mill-scale. After inspection and <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>testing</b> they are stamped with the required permanent markings, followed by external coating with a corrosion barrier paint or hot dip galvanising.|$|E

500|$|Work at {{the pump}} {{stations}} and marine terminal, which had not stopped during the winter, continued throughout the 1976 construction season. Pump Station 6, {{just south of the}} Yukon River, had to be redesigned after excavation revealed ice-rich permafrost below the site. Five pump stations needed at startup (when throughput was lower) received their pumps, turbines, and piping. As they were completed, the pump stations received <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>testing,</b> in which portions of pipe were filled with water and subjected to pressures in excess of the eventual operating conditions. Following this testing, the initial five pump stations were disconnected from the main pipeline and had oil run through them on a continuous loop. [...] "It's very similar to your new automobile," [...] one worker said. [...] "You drive it around for ten days so that any components that are going to fail are given time to fail." [...] Work on additional pump stations, which would not be needed until the pipeline was brought to full capacity, was not pressed forward.|$|E

2500|$|In addition, {{steamboat}} safety was {{an important}} aspect of the larger conflict between partisans of Andrew Jackson's [...] states-rights vision of America as a federation of strong state governments and Henry Clay's [...] "Internal Improvements Program" [...] by a strong central government. An inadequate 1838 law was greatly strengthened by the Act of 1852, which included <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>testing</b> of boilers, the establishment of maximum pressures allowed, and inspection of boiler plate at the point of manufacture. In addition, engineers were subject to testing and licenses. [...] Subsequent legislation led to the establishment of the Steamboat Inspection Service and eventually a real reduction in fatal episodes. Among the first government sponsorship for pure scientific research was a grant to the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia for the study of causes of boiler explosions.

30|$|The authors {{conducted}} {{static load}} and load transfer tests for their developed post-tensioned single-strand anchor (Cho et al. 2015). The authors also performed the load transfer tests for three different anchorages {{with respect to}} anchor geometry and reinforcement detailing in the anchorage zone (Cho and Kang 2017). WJE (2006) conducted fatigue testing of post-tensioned anchors and couplers for 12.7  mm diameter single-strand tendons, and Walsh and Kurama (2009) performed static load and fatigue tests of bare anchors and barrel anchors for both 12.7 and 15.2  mm diameter strands. Both institutions followed the testing procedure and acceptance criteria of AC 303 (ICC-ES 2011), and their test results met the criteria. However, these research programs tested a bare (or barrel) anchor for all performance tests and did not include <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>tests,</b> as {{it was not a}} corrosion-protective encapsulated system. Previously, Hayes Industries Ltd. (2014) performed <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>tests</b> of encapsulated anchor systems under 11.0  kPa for 24  h using a PVC <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>test</b> chamber in accordance with Section  2.2. 6 of PTI M 10.2 - 00 (PTI 2000), which is similar to Sections  9.3 (a) and 9.6 of ACI 423.7 - 14. PSI (2015) did a similar <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>test</b> but under more severe condition, that is, under 68.8  kPa for 24  h seemingly in accordance with Sections  9.3 (b) and 9.6 of ACI 423.7 - 14 (though the report indicated that it was tested according to Section  2.6. 8 of ACI 423.7 - 07 (Joint ACI-ASCE Committee 423 2007), which has only one hydrostatic pressure of 8.6  kPa). Both <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>tests</b> revealed that the encapsulation systems satisfied the criteria with no water leak.|$|R

40|$|OBJECT: Neuroendoscopists often note pulsatility or flabbiness of {{the floor}} of the third {{ventricle}} during endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) and believe that either is a good indication of the procedure's success. Note, however, that this belief has never been objectively measured or proven in a prospective study. The authors report on a simple test-the hydrostatic test-to assess the mobility {{of the floor}} of the third ventricle and confirm adequate ventricular flow. They also analyzed the relationship between a mobile floor (a positive <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>test)</b> and prospective success of ETV. METHODS: During a period of 3 years between July 2001 and July 2004, 30 ETVs for obstructive hydrocephalus were performed in 22 male and eight female patients. Once the stoma had been created, the irrigating Ringer lactate solution was set at a 30 -cm height from the external auditory meatus, and the irrigation valve was opened while the other ports on the endoscope were closed. The ventricular floor ballooned downward and stabilized. The irrigation valve was then closed and ports of the endoscope were opened. The magnitude of the upward displacement of the floor was then assessed. Funneling of the stoma was deemed to be a good indicator of floor mobility, adequate flow, and a positive <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>test.</b> All endoscopic procedures were recorded using digital video and recordings were subsequently assessed separately by two blinded experienced neuroendoscopists. Patients underwent prospective clinical follow up during a mean period of 11. 2 months (range 1 month- 3 years), computerized tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging studies of the brain, and measurements of cerebrospinal fluid pressure through a ventricular reservoir when present. Failure of ETV was defined as the subsequent need for shunt implantation. The overall success rate of the ETV was 70 % and varied from 86. 9 % in patients with a mobile stoma and a positive <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>test</b> to only 14. 2 % in patients with a poorly mobile floor and a negative test (p < 0. 05). The positive predictive value of the <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>test</b> was 86. 9 %, negative predictive value 85. 7 %, sensitivity 95. 2 %, and specificity 66. 6 %. CONCLUSIONS: The authors concluded that the <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>test</b> is an easy, brief test. A positive test result confirms a mobile ventricular floor and adequate flow through the created ventriculostomy. Mobility of the stoma is an important predictor of ETV success provided that there is no obstruction {{at the level of the}} arachnoid granulations or venous outflow. A thin, redundant, mobile third ventricle floor indicates a longstanding pressure differential between the third ventricle and the basal cisterns, which is a crucial factor for ETV success. A positive <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>test</b> may avert the need to insert a ventricular reservoir, thus avoiding associated risks of infection...|$|R
