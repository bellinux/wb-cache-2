5|$|During 1943, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{received}} 399 Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk fighter aircraft. Their arrival {{allowed the}} service to expand its combat force by forming five new Kittyhawk-equipped squadrons to join the three squadrons that had operated the type in the South West Pacific area since 1942. No.82 Squadron was formed at Bankstown, New South Wales, on 18June 1943. It was the third of the new Kittyhawk squadrons to be established, following No.84 Squadron in February and No.86 Squadron in March; No.78 Squadron was formed in July and No.80 Squadron in September. Commanded by Squadron Leader Stanley Galton, No.82 Squadron's original complement was 279, including fifteen officers. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been equipped wholly with P-40M Kittyhawks but initially included a flight of Bell P-39 Airacobras. No.82 Squadron conducted training at Bankstown until April 1944, when personnel briefly moved to Hughes Airfield in the Northern Territory, before being redeployed to Townsville, Queensland, for further training.|$|E

Desgrange then rescheduled the race from 1 to 19 July, increased the total prize money to 20,000 francs, reduced the entry fee to 10 francs and guaranteed at least five francs a day to the first 50 cyclists in the classification. After that, 79 cyclists {{signed up for the}} race, of whom 60 actually started the race.|$|E
5|$|No. 77 Wing was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) wing of World War II. It formed part of No.10 Operational Group (later the Australian First Tactical Air Force) at its {{establishment}} in November 1943, when it comprised three squadrons equipped with Vultee Vengeance dive bombers. No.77 Wing commenced operations in early 1944, {{flying out of}} Nadzab, Papua New Guinea. Soon afterwards, however, the Vengeance units were withdrawn from combat and replaced with squadrons flying Douglas Bostons, Bristol Beaufighters and Bristol Beauforts. The wing saw action in the assaults on Noemfoor, Tarakan, and North Borneo, by which time it was an all-Beaufighter formation made up of Nos.22, 30 and 31 Squadrons. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> taken part in the Battle of Balikpapan in June 1945, but unsuitable landing grounds meant that the Beaufighter units were withdrawn to Morotai, sitting out {{the remainder of the}} war before returning to Australia, where they disbanded, along with the wing headquarters, in 1946.|$|E
5|$|One {{of these}} {{proposals}} was the Gemini Lunar Orbit Rescue Vehicle, {{which was designed}} to retrieve the crew of an Apollo spacecraft stranded in orbit around the Moon. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> used a stretched reentry module to accommodate the three astronauts who would have been aboard the Apollo. This would have been attached to a modified Equipment Module. The Equipment Module contained engines which would be used for Lunar orbit insertion and trans-Earth injection, as well as life support equipment to keep the crew alive until they returned to Earth. Launch and trans-Lunar injection would have been performed by a Saturn V. Once the spacecraft was in Lunar orbit, the Apollo crew would have boarded it by means of an EVA.|$|E

The second phase would extend the line as a two-track line along Corona Avenue and Horace Harding Boulevard from Jackson Heights to Marathon Parkway. A storage yard would be built. This phase would have cost $51,820,000. A {{connection}} between the new line and the Crosstown Line was to have been built at 23rd Street (Ely Avenue) for $10,950,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{disposal}} of the C-130As took almost a decade, {{with the process}} being subject to a police investigation. Attempts to sell the Hercules by tender during 1978 and 1979 were unsuccessful, and the American law firm Ford and Vlahos was appointed the sales agent for the aircraft in 1981. One was sold to the French Government in 1983 and subsequently transferred to the Chadian Air Force. Another two Hercules were sold to the Colombian charter company Aviaco in 1983, but the US State Department vetoed the deal shortly before <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been completed over suspicions that the aircraft {{would be used to}} smuggle drugs into the United States. A C-130A was transferred to the newly established company International Air Aid and leased to the International Red Cross to fly humanitarian supplies into Ethiopia during 1986, but this contract was cancelled after the C-130's pilot was accused by the Ethiopian government of photographing a military area. The Australian Federal Police eventually charged two people with defrauding the Commonwealth and conspiracy in relation to these attempts to dispose of the C-130As. Eventually, four of the C-130As were sold to Aboitiz Air Transport Corporation in May 1988 and another four were acquired by the Fowler Aeronautical Corporation the next year. Two of the remaining three aircraft were retained by the RAAF for training and heritage purposes, and the final C-130A was scrapped.|$|E
