Several spray drying pump rates were rationally chosen. Comprehensive physicochemical characterization and imaging {{was carried out}} using scanning electron microscopy, hot-stage microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, powder X-ray diffraction, Karl Fischer titration, laser size diffraction, and gravimetric vapor sorption. Aerosol dispersion performance was conducted using a next generation impactor with a Food and Drug Administration-approved DPI device. These DPIs displayed excellent aerosol dispersion performance with high values in emitted dose, respirable fraction, and fine particle fraction. In addition, novel multifunctional <b>inhalation</b> aerosol <b>powder</b> formulations of cyclosporine A with lung surfactant-mimic phospholipids were also successfully designed and developed by advanced organic solution cospray drying in closed mode.

Three hundred and twenty-six newly diagnosed, steroid-naı̈ve adult patients with mild-to-moderate asthma were recruited into this randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study, comprising a 2 -week run-in period and 8 weeks of treatment. Patients received budesonide <b>inhalation</b> <b>powder</b> 400 μg/day either via Easyhaler® (n = 159) or via Turbuhaler® (n = 167), plus salbutamol <b>inhalation</b> <b>powder</b> (100 μg/dose) via Easyhaler® as rescue therapy. The study was completed by 292 patients: 143 in the Easyhaler® group and 149 in the Turbuhaler® group. The primary outcome variable, mean morning peak expiratory flow (PEF), improved significantly and almost similarly by 36. 3 and 30. 6 l/min, respectively, from run-in to weeks 7 – 8. At weeks 7 – 8, the mean (SE) difference in morning PEF between the two treatments was 7. 1 (9. 4) l/min (90 % CI from − 8. 4 to 22. 6) on per protocol analysis, which was within the defined limits for therapeutic equivalence. There {{were no significant differences}} between treatments in terms of secondary efficacy variables or adverse events. However, patients found Easyhaler® more acceptable than Turbuhaler®.

40|$|Abstract: From its introduction, the {{antibiotic}} tobramycin {{has been an}} important tool in the management of persons with cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections. Initially an intravenous rescue treatment for pulmonary exacerbations, tobramycin delivered by inhalation has become a mainstay of chronic suppressive CF infection management. Platforms for tobramycin aerosol delivery have steadily improved, with increased lung deposi-tion complimented by decreased device complexities, loaded tobramycin doses, delivery times, and treatment burdens. Most recently, a unique tobramycin <b>inhalation</b> <b>powder</b> (TIP) formulation with a portable delivery system, the TOBI ® Podhaler ® (Novartis AG, Basel, Switzerland) has been developed and approved in Europe, Canada, and Chile. Four capsules, each containing 28 mg of TIP are successively pierced and inhaled via the T- 326 Dry Powder Inhaler Device (Novartis AG, Basel, Switzerland). No external power source is required to deliver an efficacious tobramycin dose in minutes.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that intensive insulin regimens {{reduce the risk of}} diabetes-related complications. However, multiple daily injections have an important impact on treatment burden and compliance. Various non-invasive formulations of insulin have been researched and the first inhaled insulin formulation, Exubera* (insulin human [rDNA origin] <b>Inhalation</b> <b>Powder),</b> was approved in the United States and European Union for the treatment of adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes in January 2006. Comprehensive studies with Exubera have shown comparable efficacy to regular subcutaneous mealtime insulin in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and superior efficacy to oral antidiabetic agents (OAs) in patients with type 2 diabetes with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) > 8 %. Furthermore, Exubera shows a good safety profile and improved patient satisfaction versus comparators. The key limitation of this review is that that few publications are available for other inhaled insulin formulations. Although their data also suggest favorable efficacy and safety profiles, it is currently unknown whether the key findings are specific to one formulation or a class effect. Therefore, more detailed investigations are expected in the future. In the meantime, we could speculate that inhaled insulins may improve patient acceptance of insulin-based therapeutic regimens, and thereby improve glycemic control and long-term diabetic outcomes. © 2006 Librapharm Limited...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of formulation excipients on physical characteristics of <b>inhalation</b> dry <b>powders</b> prepared by spray-drying. The excipients used were a series of amino acids (glycine, alanine, leucine, isoleucine), trehalose and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC). The particle diameter and the powder density were assessed by laser diffraction and tap density measurements, respectively. The aerosol behaviour of the powders was studied in a Multi-Stage Liquid Impinger. The nature and the relative proportion of the excipients affected the aerosol performance of the powders, mainly by altering powder tap density and degree of particle aggregation. The alanine/trehalose/DPPC (30 / 10 / 60 w/w/w) formulation showed optimal aerodynamic behaviour with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 4. 7 mum, an emitted dose of 94 % and a fine particle fraction of 54 % at an airflow rate of 100 L/min using a Spinhaler inhaler device.

The inhaler design {{includes}} visual and acoustic feedback to reassure patients {{that they have}} taken their medication correctly, a dose indicator and a lock-out mechanism to prevent {{the use of an}} empty inhaler. The inhaler has medium airflow resistance and uses an optimised dispersion system to ensure effective deagglomeration of the <b>inhalation</b> <b>powder.</b> In vitro studies have demonstrated that the inhaler delivers a reproducible aerodynamic aerosol quality and is reliable under various thermal and mechanical stress conditions.

40|$|Much of the {{improvement}} in the survival of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) is due to advancements in antimicrobial treatments. New aerosolized antibiotic formulations have recently been introduced (such as inhaled aztreonam), and others are in development (inhaled levofloxacin and liposomal amikacin). Licensed dry powder formulations include tobramycin <b>inhalation</b> <b>powder</b> and dry powder colistimethate (available in Europe). Although inhaled antibiotics {{have the advantage of}} being able to deliver high intrapulmonary concentrations of drug, antimicrobial resistance can still develop and is a concern in CF. Antimicrobial resistance might be mitigated by using non-antibiotic treatments, antibiotic adjuvants, which have activity against bacteria. Examples include agents such as gallium, antimicrobial peptides and anti-biofilm compounds such as alginate oligosaccharides (OligoG) and garlic. Vaccination strategies and antibody therapy (IgY) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa have also been attempted to prevent initial infection with this organism in CF. Although aggressive and long-term use of antibiotics has been crucial in slowing lung function decline and improving survival in people with CF, it has added a significant burden of care and associated toxicities in these individuals. Careful surveillance and the use of preventative strategies for antibiotic related toxicity (such as nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity) are essential.

40|$|The {{availability}} of non-invasive insulin delivery options {{for patients with}} diabetes may encourage earlier insulin use, and thus improve glycemic control and help reduce the diabetes burden.

Pulmonary function is an important aspect of the safety profile for compounds delivered via the lungs. Pulmonary function with Exubera has been extensively investigated in several completed and ongoing Phase 3 studies conducted in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. A small, consistent but clinically non-significant decrease in pulmonary function, occurs early, does not progress during 2 years of continuous therapy, and is reversible after discontinuation. A mild, transient cough occurring after inhalation of Exubera is the most common respiratory adverse event observed. Impaired lung function in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may modify the absorption of Exubera, whereas active smoking is associated with increased absorption increasing the risk of hypoglycemia.

40|$|Repeated {{bouts of}} acute and chronic lung infections are {{responsible}} for progressive pulmonary function decline in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF), ultimately leading to respiratory failure and death. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the archetypical CF pathogen, causes chronic infection in 70 % of individuals, and is associated with an accelerated clinical decline. The management of P. aeruginosa in CF has been revolutionized with the development and widespread use of inhaled antibiotics. Aerosol delivery of antimicrobial compounds in CF enables extremely high concentrations of antibiotics to be reached directly {{at the site of}} infection potentially overcoming adaptive resistance and avoiding the potential for cumulative systemic toxicities.

The de-agglomeration efficiency for adhesive mixtures, derived from carrier residue (CR) measurement, increases both with increasing flow rate and inhalation time. At 30 l/min, 60 % fine particle detachment can be obtained within 3 s circulation time, whereas at 60 l/min only 0. 5 s is necessary to release more than 70 %. More detailed information of the change of detachment rate within the first 0. 5 s of inhalation is obtained from laser diffraction analysis (LDA) of the aerosol cloud. The experimental results can be explained with a novel force distribution concept (FDC) which is introduced {{to better understand the}} complex effects of mixing and inhalation parameters on the size distributions of adhesion and removal forces and their relevance to the de-agglomeration in the classifier. © 2003 Elsevier B.

This alternative to systematic treatment permits a high concentration of medication to act locally while minimizing side effects and residues. In human medicine, literature in this field is prolific and continuously renewed, whereas in veterinary medicine, applications of aerosol therapy are less extensive. This review considers the principles of action of the different types of devices used for inhalation, i. e., nebulization, metered-dose <b>inhalation</b> and dry <b>powder</b> <b>inhalation,</b> describes the technical and practical requirements for their use in the equine species and considers {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each inhalation device. The pharmacological agents currently administered to horses by inhalation are also discussed. Perspectives of aerosol therapy in the equine species, including aerosols already used in human medicine and their potential applications for horses are describedPeer reviewe...|$|R
