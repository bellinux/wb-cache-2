5|$|In the 1980s, the {{stations}} on the Sognsvann Line were rebuilt. The platforms were lengthened from fitting two-car to fitting four-car trains and the platform height was increased. The third rail made <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> {{cross the line}} at-grade; an underpass was therefore constructed at Berg station. The station was also redesigned in concrete with steel columns and wooden sheds designed by architect Arne Henriksen.|$|E

5|$|Prokofiev {{died at the}} age of 61 on 5 March 1953, {{the same}} day as Joseph Stalin.

5|$|A {{research}} paper published {{ten years after}} the storm suggested that Gay could have been stronger than Typhoon Tip, which attained the lowest barometric pressure ever recorded. While at its peak intensity, Gay registered a rating of 8.0 for nine consecutive hours using the Dvorak technique, indicating sustained wind speeds of at least (315km/h) 195mph. In addition, the cyclone had a significantly colder band of clouds around the eye. Typhoon Angela in 1995 presented similar features and could have been stronger than Gay. Neither of the two had direct observations into their eyes, however, making <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> confirm such intensity.|$|E

5|$|Although cinematographer Clyde DaVinna is {{credited}} with the cinematography, additional footage was shot by George Gordon Nogle, Josiah Roberts, and Leonard Smith. Screenwriter John Lee Mahin claims he shot {{a few of the}} scenes with Eskimo women when coverage was found to be lacking. Numerous days of shooting were lost in the summer when strong sunlight made <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> film. To reduce glare from the snow, most of the sets were sprayed with pink paint from the air.|$|E
5|$|Casualties were {{cared for}} by medical officers, {{stretcher}} bearers, camel drivers and sand-cart drivers who worked tirelessly, often in the firing line, covering enormous distances in difficult conditions and doing all they could to relieve {{the suffering of the}} wounded. The casualties were transported on cacolets on camels or in sand-carts back to the field ambulances, as the heavy sand made <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> use motor- or horse-drawn ambulances. Between 4 and 9 August, the Anzac Mounted Division's five field ambulances brought in 1,314 patients, including 180 enemy wounded.|$|E

The exact timing of Hudson and Moran's victories remains unclear, and it is possible each scored a victory within seconds of the other. For his determination in leading the flight, though, Little was awarded a Silver Star Medal.|$|E

5|$|Despite the damage, Tyler {{was able}} to move back into his castle, which was now {{protected}} by a small Parliamentary garrison. After investigation by Parliamentary agents Brown and Selden, however, the castle was slighted the following year, which rendered <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> defend. The Countess of Kent, the new owner of the castle, was given £1,000 in damages, but chose not to rebuild the fortification as it was by then virtually uninhabitable.|$|E
5|$|During a later court {{session on}} September 9, Takaesu {{attempted}} to submit medical evidence that Brown {{had suffered a}} back injury in 1999 and had a steel collar and bolts inserted around his spine. According to Brown, these injuries made <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> for him to assault V. N. {{as described in the}} police report.

All hands and most of the ship's stores were saved, but the condition of the ship's timbers made <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> free the ship; her captain was cleared of responsibility for the ship's loss thanks to documents detailing her defects. Recently, the wreck of Agamemnon has been located, and several artefacts have been recovered, including one of her cannons.|$|E

When his eldest son, George, was forced at the age of nine to wear a Ballila uniform in school, the family left Italy and moved to Château-d'Œx, Switzerland, where they remained for two years.|$|E

As soon as the wheels deviate from a straight path, the bicycle and rider begin to lean in the opposite direction, {{and the only way to}} right them is to steer back onto the straight path.|$|E

5|$|The Depression of the 1930s exposed glaring {{weaknesses}} in federal-provincial financial arrangements. Canada's poorer provinces found <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> cope with widespread poverty and hunger while {{the federal government}} resisted taking full responsibility for unemployment relief. By 1937, conditions had become so desperate that the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan faced bankruptcy. Finally, in August 1937, Prime Minister King appointed the Royal Commission on Dominion-Provincial Relations, popularly known as the Rowell-Sirois Commission. According to biographer Stephen Henderson, Macdonald {{played an important role}} in shaping the Commission's final recommendations.|$|E
