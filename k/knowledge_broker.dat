40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the process of}} <b>knowledge</b> <b>brokering</b> for organizational learning. Qualitative research methodology was employed to study learning in four Indian Social Enterprises.

We found that <b>knowledge</b> <b>brokering</b> was a process of spanning for, interpreting and combining two types of knowledge – expert and contextual, with strategic knowledge playing a critical background role in this process. <b>Knowledge</b> <b>brokering</b> was delineated into two roles – boundary spanning and translation. Agents who assumed and/or shared these roles were identified and the corresponding learning mechanisms were described. Variations were observed across enterprises in brokering role assumption and the location of brokers with respect to the organizational boundary and hierarchy. These were explained using the concept of immersion which emerged from the data.

40|$|Despite {{significant}} {{efforts in}} natural resource management (NRM), the environmental condition of Victoria&# 039;s catchments is mostly &# 039;poor to moderate&# 039;, {{and continuing to}} decline in many places. NRM is a complex undertaking involving social, economic, and environmental objectives, across policy, research, and practice dimensions. It is therefore not easy {{to ensure that the}} knowledge required to underpin effective NRM is readily available to practitioners. <b>Knowledge</b> <b>brokering</b> is an emerging approach with the potential to improve knowledge sharing and exchange. While it has attracted attention in other areas of public interest (such as health and information technology), its potential in NRM has received relatively limited attention. This article reports on a Victorian <b>knowledge</b> <b>brokering</b> case study which was a major element in the Catchment Knowledge Exchange project. A key finding is that <b>knowledge</b> <b>brokering</b> is a role that is being undertaken informally, without proper acknowledgement or definition. This raises challenges for knowledge management in the context of NRM. We conclude that the &# 039;people&# 039; component of <b>knowledge</b> <b>brokering</b> is the driving element, although organisational processes and information technologies are critical in enhancing the effectiveness of <b>knowledge</b> <b>brokers.</b> Demonstrating the benefits of <b>knowledge</b> <b>brokering</b> in terms of the ultimate measure of its contribution towards improving the condition of catchments remains a challenge...|$|R
40|$|Our study {{examines}} <b>brokering</b> of situated <b>knowledge</b> within an organizational context, characterized by professional hierarchy. We examine how professional affiliation and associated power differentials impact upon <b>knowledge</b> <b>brokering</b> {{at the individual}} and group levels within an organization. Our empirical case, which combines social network analysis and qualitative fieldwork, is set in healthcare with a focus upon integration of management, psychosocial and clinical component knowledge domains deemed necessary for treatment of a long-term condition. Our study shows that peer-to-peer <b>knowledge</b> <b>brokering,</b> which is framed by professional hierarchy, remains pervasive with respect to medical <b>knowledge</b> <b>brokering.</b> However, social structures might be mediated through developing architectural knowledge, reflected in both formal and informal organizational routines and schema, which engenders community tendencies that transcend professional hierarchy, so that <b>knowledge</b> <b>brokering</b> is more widely distributed to benefit patients...|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyses}} the <b>knowledge</b> <b>broker,</b> {{defined as}} a knowledge intensive type of intermediation among dispersed expertise {{at the global level}} - upstream - and client's needs or latent opportunities - downstream -. Hargadon in 1998 introduced this concept setting a promising research agenda, but then focused mainly on the technology brokering activity. After 15 years this model calls for further investigation. The aim of this contribution is to provide a better understanding about knowledge brokering: which are the differences from other strategic orientations, the key capabilities needed to support effectively this activity and the business practices in the actual scenario, its impact on the competitive advantage. The study proposes a case study survey concerning three companies: Accenture, Alessi, ENI. Evidences support <b>knowledge</b> <b>broker</b> as a 'creator' and not purely carrier of knowledge between disconnected domains. The geographic dimension emerges in all the analyzed cases. The <b>knowledge</b> <b>broker</b> is characterized by a global orientation of upstream (technology, design, [...] .) and downstream (customers, distributors, [...] .) markets and by a multilocal understanding of where and how the needed specific knowledge can be found. Literature review and empirical evidences also permit to clarify analogies and differences compared to related constructs...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to understand}} how parents use health information (such as those developed from the Move 2 ̆ 6 PLAY study) {{with the aid of}} a <b>knowledge</b> <b>broker</b> when living with and caring for young children with cerebral palsy. This research was conducted under a qualitative case study methodology and used questionnaires and in-depth interviews to collect data.

40|$|Drawing {{upon the}} ability-motivation-opportunity (AMO) framework, our study extends {{understanding}} {{of the interaction between}} human resource (HR) practices and the <b>brokering</b> of <b>knowledge</b> by hybrid middle managers. Examining health care delivered to older people in a hospital setting, our study highlights that hybrid nurse middle managers <b>broker</b> <b>knowledge</b> downward through professional hierarchy to their peer group, but find it difficult to <b>broker</b> <b>knowledge</b> upward. Meanwhile, because they lack legitimacy with doctors, they lack the opportunity to <b>broker</b> <b>knowledge</b> interprofessionally. Hybrid medical middle managers are potentially more able to <b>broker</b> <b>knowledge</b> within their peer group. However, some of lower status intraprofessionally, like nurses, may lack legitimacy and opportunity to do so. Meanwhile, higher-status medical middle managers may lack motivation to engage in <b>knowledge</b> <b>brokering</b> with peers outside their specialism. We suggest that inter- and intraprofessional power and status has important implications for HR practices to support <b>knowledge</b> <b>brokering</b> by hybrid middle managers. Should HR practices fail to support ability, motivation, and opportunity for <b>knowledge</b> <b>brokering</b> across and within professions, then a “broken” rather than “broker” chain may result...|$|R

40|$|A lot of {{attention}} {{has been focused on}} the policy stream of the multiple streams framework (MSF). John Kingdon used the role of the policy entrepreneur to theorize what was going on when problems become political issues. In order to fully grasp this process we need to further theorize also the problem stream. What {{is going on in the}} problem stream is defining the conditions for coupling done by policy entrepreneurs. It creates the context for coupling. Framing of a condition as a problem make us think about the problem in a particular way, which enables coupling to certain policies, but not to others. By including the <b>knowledge</b> <b>broker</b> as an actor in the problem stream, we can study the process of framing conditions as political problems and thereby the context of coupling. How political problems are viewed in different countries could possibly depend on differences in problem framing, rather than regarding policy entrepreneurs. The constant framing and reframing by knowledge brokers makes it important to study who gets to talk and who is listened to. Time, access, and credibility are crucial for the success of a <b>knowledge</b> <b>broker.</b> A further benefit of including the <b>knowledge</b> <b>broker</b> in the MSF is that we can theorize why actors move or do not move between streams. Kingdon argued that this movement was possible, but rather limited. The presence of institutional constraints is suggested as important for understanding this. My arguments are illustrated by a case study of climate change policy-making in the Swedish and international context...|$|E
40|$|International audienceKnowledge brokers {{move and}} {{translate}} knowledge and create connections between researchers and their various audiences. There is nowadays {{an increasing number}} of people and institutions devoted to knowledge brokering: science shops, technology transfer offices, science journalists, and people working in health institutions. Two arguments will be made in this talk. First, <b>brokering</b> <b>knowledge</b> means far more than simply moving knowledge, it also means transforming knowledge. The result of brokering is the production of a new kind of knowledge—what we could call <b>brokered</b> <b>knowledge.</b> <b>Brokered</b> <b>knowledge</b> is knowledge made more usable, knowledge that “serves locally” at a given time, knowledge that has been de- and reassembled. Second, I will argue that <b>knowledge</b> <b>brokering</b> should be understood both as a place and a process (in a sense, as a taxi and as the art of driving a taxi). <b>Knowledge</b> <b>brokering</b> can serve as a conduit between two existing worlds but it can also lead to a new world. In other words, it can be seen as an “intermediary” and it {{can be seen as the}} practice of “mediation” which leads to change. I will thus use the term “intermediation” to try to capture what <b>knowledge</b> <b>brokering</b> is...|$|R
