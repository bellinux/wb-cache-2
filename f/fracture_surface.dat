5|$|Chlorine {{is widely}} used for purifying water, {{especially}} potable water supplies and water used in swimming pools. Several catastrophic collapses of swimming pool ceilings have occurred from chlorine-induced stress corrosion cracking of stainless steel suspension rods. Some polymers are also sensitive to attack, including acetal resin and polybutene. Both materials were used in hot and cold water domestic plumbing, and stress corrosion cracking caused widespread failures in the USA in the 1980s and 1990s. The picture on the right shows a fractured acetal joint in a water supply system. The cracks started at injection molding defects in the joint and slowly grew until the part failed. The <b>fracture</b> <b>surface</b> shows iron and calcium salts that were deposited in the leaking joint from the water supply before failure.|$|E

2500|$|One {{possible}} {{application is}} measuring the roughness of ice crystals.

The cold fractured surface (sometimes [...] "etched" [...] by increasing the temperature to about −100°C for several minutes to let some ice sublime) is then shadowed with evaporated platinum or gold at an average angle of 45° in a high vacuum evaporator. A second coat of carbon, evaporated perpendicular to the average surface plane is often performed to improve stability of the replica coating. The specimen is returned to room temperature and pressure, then the extremely fragile [...] "pre-shadowed" [...] metal replica of the <b>fracture</b> <b>surface</b> is released from the underlying biological material by careful chemical digestion with acids, hypochlorite solution or SDS detergent. The still-floating replica is thoroughly washed free from residual chemicals, carefully fished up on fine grids, dried then viewed in the TEM.|$|E

40|$|A fractographic {{study of}} Mode II <b>fracture</b> <b>surfaces</b> has been {{conducted}} {{for the purpose of}} identifying the microstructural mechanisms responsible for fracture in the edge-sliding mode. A compact shear (CS) specimen was employed to generate the <b>fracture</b> <b>surfaces</b> and also to establish Mode II fracture toughness values for Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, A 533 -B steel, and several aluminum alloys. In all tests, one of the two edge cracks sustained complete Mode II fracture while the other exhibited only a limited amount of subcritical crack growth. Mode II <b>fracture</b> <b>surfaces,</b> which were unique in appearance, have been examined by optical and scanning electron microscopy. It was determined that shear (or parabolic) microvoid coalescence was the dominant mechanism for Mode II fracture.

40|$|Several rock-fracture {{experiments}} {{are carried out}} under the conditions of dynamic impact and static uniaxial loading. Irregularity of the <b>fracture</b> <b>surfaces</b> of basalt and dunite fragments is quantitatively described by "fractal dimension". The <b>fractured</b> <b>surfaces</b> produced by dynamic impacts have a small fractal dimension indicating the relatively smooth surfaces. On the other hand, the <b>fracture</b> <b>surfaces</b> produced by static uniaxial loading have a large fractal dimension. In {{the case of the}} dynamic impact, basalt and dunite possess similar fractal dimensions, while in the case of static loading, they have different distributions of fractal dimension.

50|$|When the macro-crack initiates {{from one}} RVE whose size is not {{negligible}} {{compared to the}} structure size, the deterministic size effect dominates over the statistical size effect.

40|$|AbstractAn {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the rupture mechanisms in a mid-strength and a high-strength steel were conducted employing a novel test configuration. The specimen used was a double notched tube specimen loaded in combined tension and torsion at a fixed ratio. The effective plastic strain, the stress triaxiality and the Lode parameter were determined in {{the centre of the}} notch at failure. Scanning electron microscopy of the <b>fractured</b> <b>surfaces</b> revealed two distinctively different ductile rupture mechanisms depending on the stress state. At high stress triaxiality the <b>fractured</b> <b>surfaces</b> were covered with large and deep dimples, suggesting that growth and internal necking of voids being the governing rupture mechanism. At low triaxiality {{it was found that the}} <b>fractured</b> <b>surfaces</b> were covered with elongated small shear dimples, suggesting internal void shearing being the governing rupture mechanism. In the <b>fractured</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the high-strength steel, regions with quasi-cleavage were also observed.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{microstructure}} on the fracture characteristics of high carbon hypo eutectoid steel was studied {{under conditions of}} quasistatic and dynamic loading. Experimentally determined sets of fracture toughness and Charpy impact energy values were statistically treated. A relationship was found between fracture toughness and Charpy impact energy. In the very brittle domain, the fracture toughness increases slightly with increasing Charpy impact energy. In the domain where the fracture toughness is higher, the rise in fracture toughness with increasing Charpy impact energy is more pronounced. Detailed SEM examination of fractured compact tension (CT) and Charpy V-notch (CVN) specimens showed that the fracture at ambient temperature occurred almost exclusively by cleavage. There were no visible differences in the morphology of cleavage facets on the <b>fracture</b> <b>surfaces</b> of Charpy and CT specimens. Mechanisms of cleavage initiation were revealed by the fractographical investigation of <b>fracture</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Whereas the <b>fracture</b> <b>surfaces</b> of broken CT specimens exhibit a number of cleavage origins, the <b>fracture</b> <b>surfaces</b> of CVN specimens usually show only one...|$|R
