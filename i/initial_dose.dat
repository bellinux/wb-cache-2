To combat the danger of dysentery, Ford had all available supplies of sulphaguanidine in Australia shipped up to New Guinea, where Australian forces were fighting a desperate campaign against the Japanese. This was a new drug that Neil Hamilton Fairley had tested in the Middle East, and found to be effective. An <b>initial</b> <b>dose</b> of 4g followed by 2g doses at four hourly intervals was found to rapidly relieve the symptoms and permit the sufferers to travel.|$|E

50|$|The <b>initial</b> <b>doses</b> of {{premazepam}} {{given to}} human test subjects demonstrated similar psychological test results to those produced by diazepam. It was also demonstrated that <b>initial</b> <b>dosing</b> with premazepam produces similar sedative effects {{as compared with}} diazepam, although psychomotor impairments are greater with premazepam than with diazepam after <b>initial</b> <b>dosing.</b> However, with repeated dosing {{for more than one}} day premazepam causes less sedation and less psychomotor impairment than diazepam. Premazepam possesses sedative and anxiolytic properties. Premazepam produces more slow wave and less fast wave EEG changes than diazepam. Tests have shown that 7.5 mg of premazepam is approximately equivalent to 5 mg of diazepam.|$|R

The Dalhousie researchers developed a way to deliver PZP antigens in liposomes, causing the release of antigens to be delayed. This research {{would result in the}} product SpayVac™. Independent trials of SpayVac™ in deer found that a single <b>initial</b> <b>dose</b> can function as a contraceptive.|$|E
25|$|General {{anesthesia}} is not maintained with barbiturate drugs. An induction dose of thiopental {{wears off}} {{after a few}} minutes because the thiopental redistributes from the brain {{to the rest of the}} body very quickly. However, it has a long half-life, which means that a long time is needed for the drug to be eliminated from the body. If a very large <b>initial</b> <b>dose</b> is given, little or no redistribution takes place (since the body is saturated with the drug), which means that recovery of consciousness requires the drug to be eliminated from the body, which is not only slow (taking many hours or days), but unpredictable in duration, making barbiturates very unsatisfactory for maintenance of anesthesia.|$|E

50|$|The <b>initial</b> <b>doses</b> of {{chlorprothixene}} {{should always}} be {{as low as possible}} (e.g. 30 mg at bedtime, 15 mg morning dose) and be increased gradually. Patients receiving 90 mg daily (and more) of the drug should be hospitalized, particularly during the initial phase of treatment. The theoretical maximum is 800 mg daily which can usually not be given due to side effects as stated above. Elderly and pediatric patients should be treated with particular low <b>initial</b> <b>doses.</b> Dose increments should be done slowly. If chlorprothixene is to be withdrawn, it should not be stopped abruptly, but the dose should be decreased steadily.|$|R

25|$|The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium {{recommends}} avoiding amitriptyline {{in patients}} who are CYP2D6 ultrarapid or poor metabolizers, due to the risk {{for a lack of}} efficacy and side effects, respectively. The consortium also recommends considering an alternative drug not metabolized by CYP2C19 {{in patients who}} are CYP2C19 ultrarapid metabolizers. A reduction in starting dose is recommended for patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers and CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. If use of amitriptyline is warranted, therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended to guide dose adjustments. The Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group also recommends selecting an alternative drug or monitoring plasma concentrations of amitriptyline in patients who are CYP2D6 poor or ultrarapid metabolizers, and selecting an alternative drug or reducing <b>initial</b> <b>dose</b> in patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers.|$|E
25|$|The plasma protein-binding of {{zopiclone}} {{has been}} reported to be weak, between 45 and 80% (mean 52–59%). It is rapidly and widely distributed to body tissues, including the brain, and is excreted in urine, saliva, and breast milk. Zopiclone is partly extensively metabolized in the liver to form an active N-demethylated derivative (N-desmethylzopiclone) and an inactive zopiclone-N-oxide. Hepatic enzymes playing the most significant role in zopiclone metabolism are CYP3A4 and CYP2E1. In addition, about 50% of the administered dose is decarboxylated and excreted via the lungs. In urine, the N-demethyl and N-oxide metabolites account for 30% of the <b>initial</b> <b>dose.</b> Between 7 and 10% of zopiclone is recovered from the urine, indicating extensive metabolism of the drug before excretion. The terminal elimination half-life of zopiclone ranges from 3.5 to 6.5 hours (5 hours on average).|$|E
500|$|More {{than half}} of people with {{advanced}} cancer and pain will need strong opioids, and these in combination with non-opioid pain medicine can produce acceptable analgesia in 70–90 percent of cases. A Cochrane review updated in 2016 concluded that morphine is effective in relieving cancer pain. Side effects of nausea and constipation are rarely severe enough to warrant stopping of treatment. [...] Sedation and cognitive impairment usually occur with the <b>initial</b> <b>dose</b> or {{a significant increase in}} dosage of a strong opioid, but improve after a week or two of consistent dosage. Antiemetic and laxative treatment should be commenced concurrently with strong opioids, to counteract the usual nausea and constipation. Nausea normally resolves after two or three weeks of treatment but laxatives will need to be aggressively maintained.|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} the {{in vitro fertilization}} and intracytoplasmic sperm injection outcomes after high <b>initial</b> <b>doses</b> of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in patients with poor ovarian reserve. Materials and MethodsFor in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection patients younger than 40 years of age, 345 cycles were examined from April 2003 to April 2007. As a control, 218 cycles received gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist and regular <b>initial</b> <b>doses</b> of FSH from day 3 of the treated cycle. The remaining 127 cycles were treated with high <b>initial</b> <b>doses</b> of FSH with an antagonist or low doses of gonadotropin-releasing hormone because of poor ovarian reserve. ResultsWhen higher <b>initial</b> <b>doses</b> of FSH were used, lower estradiol levels {{on the day of}} human chorionic gonadotropin injection and less mature oocytes were retrieved from the group with poor ovarian reserve. Clinical pregnancy rates per embryo transfer were similar (45. 7 % vs. 48. 2 %, p = 0. 686). There was a trend of lower ongoing pregnancy rate per cycle (28. 3 % vs. 38. 5 %, p = 0. 05) in the study compared with the control group. In the subgroups with high doses of FSH, neither protocol was superior in terms of clinical (45. 5 % vs. 46. 2 %, p= 0. 952) or ongoing pregnancy rates per embryo transfer (37. 9 % vs. 42. 3 %, p= 0. 695). ConclusionThere {{was no significant difference in}} clinical pregnancy rate of the two groups when good embryos were obtained. The group with poor ovarian reserve had lower ongoing pregnancy rates per cycle. For patients with expected poor ovarian response, treatment with high doses of FSH initially is an option...|$|R
40|$|Vancomycin is {{currently}} recommended as first-line therapy for many meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Recent guidelines have advocated loading doses (25 - 30 mg/kg) in critically ill patients {{in order to}} achieve therapeutic concentrations rapidly. However, weight-based loading doses are still not widely practised. A drug use evaluation was performed to improve the appropriateness of vancomycin <b>initial</b> <b>doses</b> in a population of critically ill adults. An educational intervention incorporating a vancomycin dosing protocol was carried out. Data were collected pre and post intervention. Vancomycin exposure [area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) ] in the first 24 h was determined using serum concentrations and the Bayesian software TCIWorks. <b>Initial</b> vancomycin <b>doses</b> and exposures were compared between the pre- and post-intervention groups using chi(2) and Mann-Whitney tests. A total of 111 vancomycin courses were analysed in the pre-intervention (n = 80) and post-intervention (n = 31) groups. Patients in the post-intervention group had significantly higher median weight-based <b>initial</b> <b>doses</b> (20. 0 mg/kg vs. 12. 5 mg/kg; P = 400) in the first 24 h of therapy. A vancomycin dosing protocol improved the <b>initial</b> <b>dosing</b> of vancomycin and the proportion of patients who rapidly achieved optimal vancomycin exposures. However, subtherapeutic exposures were still prevalent and may warrant more vigilant promotion of the dosing protocol to ensure that recommended vancomycin doses are used in this population.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Objective. To {{compare the}} {{incidence}} of liver toxicity and clinical response between 2 <b>initial</b> <b>dosing</b> regimens of methotrexate (MTX) for treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Methods. Clinical and laboratory data were abstracted from the medical records of 220 children newly prescribed MTX from the same geographic region. One cohort received <b>initial</b> <b>doses</b> of MTX> 0. 5 mg/kg/week (“high-dose”) and one cohort received <b>initial</b> <b>doses</b> of MTX ≤ 0. 5 mg/kg/week (“low-dose”). Toxicity {{was defined as a}}spartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotrans-ferase (ALT) above the normal range, and positive clinical response was defined as a reduction in active joint count during the first 6 months of MTX therapy. Results. One hundred twenty-six children were in the high-dose MTX group, 94 in the low-dose MTX group. At 6 months, the high-dose group was more likely to have an elevated AST or ALT (adjusted OR 3. 89, 95 % CI 1. 82 – 8. 29, p < 0. 0001). Subjects receiving both MTX and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) had no significant difference between groups in change of active joint count, while subjects in the high-dose group but not taking NSAID had more active joints (p = 0. 036) at 6 months compared to the low-dose group. Conclusion. Initial high-dose MTX was associated with an increased risk of at least one liver enzyme abnormality with no significant improvement in active joint count. This suggests that ther...|$|R
