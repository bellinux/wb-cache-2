In-plane eccentric loads were statically applied to a couple of panels in ten uniform steps. For each step, <b>dynamic</b> <b>impact</b> <b>testing</b> was performed and the modal damping, peak amplitude and natural frequencies obtained. Second, a ‘hybrid ’ model, based on the concepts of modal analysis and the Finite Element Method, was developed in order to obtain the natural frequencies and corresponding normal modes of the composite panels within the frequency range 0 – 200 Hz. For this model, an initial warp of the panel middle surface was incorporated into the formulation in order to represent the applied flexural moment provoked by the eccentric in-plane loads.

This requires quantification of the capacity of individual trees to dissipate the energy released by <b>dynamic</b> <b>impacts,</b> which has previously only been based on data obtained from static tree-pulling <b>tests</b> or from <b>dynamic</b> <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> on wood samples. We predicted that these data are not representative of the maximum amount of energy that can be dissipated by living trees during <b>dynamic</b> <b>impacts.</b> To <b>test</b> this prediction, we carried out rockfall experiments on a forested slope in the French Alps. To calculate the rock’s energy before and after impact, rockfalls were filmed digitally. The recordings of nine impacts causing instantaneous breakage of Abies alba Mill. trees were analyzed in detail. An exponential relationship between stem diameter at breast height (DBH) and the maximum amount of energy a tree can dissipate was highly correlated for all of our experimental data. We applied this relationship to other tree species based on published fracture energies. The relationships obtained were significantly correlated with data from other <b>dynamic</b> <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> in the field.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering. Using three {{linear accelerometers}} and three angular rate sensors {{arranged}} to measure local acceleration in the X, Y, and Z directions and angular velocity about those axes, {{it is possible}} to calculate spatial orientation and position in a global coordinate system. The intent of this thesis is to use this calculation to provide the head trajectory of an Anthropomorphic Test Device (ATD) to supplement or replace photometric analysis. This thesis examines the various parameters of the calculations of the spatial orientation and position to determine the most accurate and efficient method. Using the local angular velocity as an input, this method determines spatial orientation as a function of a unit quaternion by numerically solving a system of ordinary differential equation. The parameters of the numerical integration examined are the numerical integration methods, time step, and order of rotation. These functions are examined through simulation data generated by various MADYMO models. The MADYMO three-dimensional multi-body simulations output the linear accelerations and angular velocity of selected bodies in simulations similar to the data provided from accelerometers and angular rate sensors during <b>dynamic</b> <b>impact</b> <b>testing.</b> Simulation data is useful in the examination and validation of the different parameters used in the method {{due to the lack of}} noise and gravitational effects incurred during physical <b>dynamic</b> <b>impact</b> <b>testing.</b> The method is evaluated for <b>dynamic</b> <b>impact</b> <b>testing</b> through a comparison between the calculated spatial orientation and position using the algorithm and photometric analysis as well as physical limitations in the test setup, i. e. rigid bulkhead.

These films were characterized and analyzed {{in terms of}} their microstructure by X-ray diffraction, their hardness by microindentation measurements, their surface root-mean-square roughness by atomic force microscopy, and their friction and wear behaviors by Rockwell-C testing, microscratch testing, <b>dynamic</b> <b>impact</b> <b>testing</b> and pin-on-disc tribometer. It was found that the mechanical and tribological properties of multicomponent films (typically 1. 6 ± 0. 2 μm in thickness) were closely related to the C content (varied from 4. 4 at. % to 42. 0 at. %). For the best multicomponent film with 12. 4 at. % C content, a high hardness of 27 GPa was achieved and the best cohesive and adhesive strength was evidenced in terms of critical load values of L C 1 (~ 37 N), L C 2 (> 75 N), and the highest adhesive strength (HF 1). Moreover, by <b>dynamic</b> <b>impact</b> <b>testing</b> the multicomponent film could endure impact cycles up to 2 × 10 5 without adhesive failure. However, when the C content was further increased up to 42. 0 at. %, the hardness, cohesive and adhesive strength were decreased due to the formation of amorphous structure. It was also found that the pin-on-disc test under dry conditions showed that the frictional coefficients decreased with C content. The frictional coefficients obtained at a load of 2 N were kept at ∼ 0. 57 without C incorporation and decreased to ~ 0. 18 at C current of 4. 0 A.

40|$|Workstation {{tables in}} {{commuter}} rail trains {{have been identified}} as an area for improving passenger safety during train collisions. The goal of this senior project was to create such a table using a composite sandwich structure designed to safely absorb energy. Testing of previous table designs was used to establish engineering specifications for the static loading, work surface durability, and impact performance requirements of the new table. Analytical and finite element models were used to analyze new concepts until a design was achieved that could meet all specifications. The tabletop developed consists of a crushable aluminum honeycomb core with fiberglass laminates on top and bottom. This sandwich structure uses a combination of E‐glass cloth and S‐glass unidirectional tape in a unique layup that lowers impact forces inflicted on the passenger while maintaining overall table strength during normal loading conditions. Four tables were built during the senior project. These tables were fabricated using a combination of fiberglass layup, metal working, welding, and adhesive bonding. Using these tables, four validation tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of the new design: work surface indent testing, vertical and horizontal static loading, quasi-static crush testing, and <b>dynamic</b> <b>impact</b> <b>testing.</b> The results of these tests showed that the new table met all of the engineering specifications outlined {{at the beginning of the}} project. The work surface was stronger than expected, showing deformation at a load of 175 lbs; well above the requirement of 65 lbs or more. The table easily withstood the 225 lb vertical and 337 lb horizontal static loading requirements at all critical locations. Quasi-static testing showed that a 1500 ‐ 2000 lb edge load is needed to initiate crushing of the table. Although the desired goal of 800 ‐ 1000 lb was not achieved, the facesheets did begin buckling in the unbounded sections as designed at about 1000 lbs; only 100 lbs from the 900 lb buckling load predicted by FEA. Unfortunately, the tables continue to support load after initial buckling up to the witnessed 1500 ‐ 2000 lbs. In <b>dynamic</b> <b>impact</b> <b>testing,</b> the table produced some of the lowest peak acceleration levels of any design to date. The peak acceleration levels recorded were 14 g and 20 g for the two impacting masses; well below the specification of 30 g for any time period over 3 ms. The tabletop structure also crushed evenly and the facesheets remained bonded and contained under the aluminum edging. The overall metal structure of the table also held its form, suggesting that the passenger would remain safe during such an impact. The new table costs about $ 475 and weighs 37 lbs...|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} of natural turf surfaces to loading changes {{with the force}} and loading rate applied. Quantification of surface behaviour to athlete loading {{is complicated by the}} lack of devices that replicate forces, stresses and loading rates of athletes that can be specifically used on natural turf. To address this issue, a vertical <b>dynamic</b> <b>impact</b> <b>testing</b> device, the DST, was developed. The DST consists of a compressed air driven ram which vertically impacts a studded test foot onto the surface using data from biomechanical studies. The vertical dynamic stress of athlete foot strike during running is replicated, using peak force and mean boot contact area data. The ram pressure is adjustable to allow variation of the stress applied upon impact, potentially replicating a range of athlete-surface interactions. Initial laboratory testing indicated that the device was sensitive to changes in soil condition due to variations in impact data. Total penetration time and distance, and surface energy absorption were all significantly greater in prepared ‘soft' soil treatments (p< 0. 05). Loading rate in the first 50 ms after impact was significantly greater in the ‘hardest' soil treatment (p< 0. 05).

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Strong post guardrail systems have long been employed to keep misguided vehicles on the roadway. In order to combat vegetation growth around the posts, many new guardrail installations are being encased in pavement mow strips. By increasing material stiffness of the confining layers around the posts, this practice changes the dynamic response of the guardrail system to the impact of a vehicle. This research aims to analyze existing mow strip configurations by using experimental testing and numerical simulation and to develop predictive, full-scale simulations that enable assessment of the performance of guardrail systems encased in mow strips. To develop a test matrix of mow strip designs in preparation for possible testing, a state of practice survey of Texas Department of Transportation districts is performed. Current mow strip construction methods and designs are gathered. Mow strip dimensions, materials, and depths are considered in addition to the presence of asphalt and grout "leave-out" layers around posts. Seventeen configurations using wood and steel posts embedded in asphalt, concrete, soil, and grout are subjected to <b>dynamic</b> <b>impact</b> <b>testing</b> with a bogie vehicle. Dynamic impact tests from the test matrix are numerically simulated using the nonlinear, dynamic, explicit code LS-DYNA. Modeling of soil, steel, concrete, and grout components is investigated. Results from numerical simulation are validated using experimental test results. Four full-scale mow strip system simulations are assembled using subcomponent models. Impact of a vehicle with a G 4 (1 S) guardrail system is simulated. Results are compared to a full-scale crash test for validation. Enhancements to the simulation are made to increase numerical stability of the vehicle model and improve interaction between the vehicle and guardrail system. In addition, three mow strip guardrail systems are modeled using the G 4 (1 S) system as a baseline case. Concrete mow strip and grout leave-out encasements are also examined. Through numerical simulation of a full-scale crash test it is shown that a concrete mow strip with 457 x 457 mm (18 x 18 in.) grout leave-outs performs at a similar level in a full-scale crash test to an equivalent system with posts embedded only in soil.

The foam material model provided closer agreement with experiment over a range of impact speeds and surfaces than viscoelastic material models that are commonly used...|$|R

The work presents {{a method of}} dynamic testing of thin hard coatings on a newly constructed prototype of impact wear tester. It provides a comparison with standard methods of layer testing and presents new experimental results of <b>dynamic</b> <b>impact</b> wear <b>test</b> of the coatings. Finally, the thesis covers preparation techniques of thin film systems deposited on various substrates and their characterization using optical and electron microscopy...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNacre (the pearly {{internal}} layer of molluscan shells) {{is an attractive}} nanocomposite displaying high mechanical properties, low density and a good biocompatibility with human bones. It is currently studied for both the prosthesis design {{and the creation of}} new organic/inorganic hybrid materials by mimicking biomineralisation processes. These exceptional mechanical properties are ascribed to its highly ordered layered 'bricks and mortar' microstructure and more particularly to the energy absorption ability of the mortar during crack propagation. However, this ability appears to be drastically reduced in presence of nano-shocks generated during friction by the dynamic solicitations. This paper compares two Finite Element simulations – a quasi-static compression <b>test</b> and a <b>dynamic</b> <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> – in order to consider the fracture mechanisms induced by friction. It reveals that cracks migrate from the mortar to the bricks, involving in the latter case, the formation of wear nano-debris. These numerical results are confronted with experimental results during friction...|$|R
40|$|Anchors or {{trawl gear}} {{occasionally}} impact offshore pipelines, resulting in large {{local and global}} deformations. Impact velocities are typically less than 5 [*]m/s, but local strain rates may be very high. In this study strain rate effects in an X 65 offshore material was characterised by split Hopkinson bar tests, while the cross-section homogeneity and possible anisotropic behaviour were determined by quasi-static material <b>tests.</b> Further, <b>dynamic</b> <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> at prescribed velocities were carried out on simply supported full scale X 65 steel pipes. Next, deformation-controlled quasi-static tests with the same boundary conditions were conducted. The level of deformation in the quasi-static tests was set to be equal to that attained in the dynamic tests. Finally, {{an assessment of the}} differences between the dynamically and quasi-statically loaded pipes was made in terms of force-displacement response, energy absorbed, and fracture. An optical light microscope and a scanning electron microscope were used to investigate fracture surfaces arising from the various tests...|$|R
