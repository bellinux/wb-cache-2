[...] Early locomotives used often <b>jackshaft</b> drives. In this arrangement, the traction motor is mounted within the body of the locomotive and drives the <b>jackshaft</b> through a set of gears.

The <b>jackshaft</b> drive was abandoned for all but the smallest units when smaller and lighter motors were developed, ...|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the first}} uses of the term <b>jackshaft</b> {{in the context of}} {{railroad}} equipment was in an 1890 patent application by Samuel Mower. In his electric-motor driven railroad truck, the motor was geared to a <b>jackshaft</b> mounted between the side frames. A sliding Dog clutch inside the <b>jackshaft</b> was used to select one of several gear ratios on the chain drive to the driven axle. [...] Later railroad jackshafts were generally connected to the driving wheels using side rods; see <b>Jackshaft</b> (locomotive) for details.|$|E
50|$|The locomotive's {{mechanical}} transmission {{consisted of a}} single, frame-mounted traction motor powering a <b>jackshaft</b> drive via a reduction gear; the <b>jackshaft</b> drove all three driving axles via connecting rod and coupling rods.|$|E
50|$|Modern <b>jackshafts</b> and countershafts {{are often}} hidden inside large {{machinery}} as {{components of the}} larger overall device.|$|R
50|$|Continuing {{development}} of electric motors made them smaller, and by World War II, most new and made <b>jackshafts</b> obsolete.|$|R

50|$|A <b>jackshaft,</b> {{also called}} a countershaft, {{is a common}} {{mechanical}} design component used to transfer or synchronize rotational force in a machine. A <b>jackshaft</b> is often just a short stub with supporting bearings on the ends and two pulleys, gears, or cranks attached to it. In general, a <b>jackshaft</b> is any shaft that is used as an intermediary transmitting power from a driving shaft to a driven shaft.|$|E
5000|$|The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was {{a pioneer}} in the use of <b>jackshaft</b> driven {{locomotive}}s. While the drive axle of the first Grasshopper locomotive was directly driven by spur gears from the crankshaft, the Traveler delivered in 1833, used a <b>jackshaft,</b> as did all the later Grasshopper and Crab locomotives. These locomotives used step-up gearing to achieve a reasonable running speed using small diameter driving wheels. It is notable that the term <b>jackshaft</b> was not used by the designers of these machines. Instead, they referred to what would later be called a <b>jackshaft</b> as [...] "a separate axle, about three feet forward of the front axle, and carrying cranks coupled by connecting rods to cranks on the two road axles." [...] In his 1837 patent for {{what became known as the}} crab class of locomotives, Ross Winans referred to his <b>jackshaft</b> as [...] "a pinion wheel shaft", or [...] "third axle." ...|$|E
5000|$|Some early {{locomotives}} used small diameter DC {{traction motors}} mounted on individual axles, but the majority, especially for AC powered locomotives, {{had only one}} or two large diameter motors. These large diameter motors were larger than most driving wheels and so were mounted well above the level of the driving axles. [...] The motor or motors drove the <b>jackshaft</b> or jackshafts through gears or side rods, and then the <b>jackshaft</b> turned the wheels through side rods. In Europe, Oerlikon and Brown, Boveri pioneered a variety of <b>jackshaft</b> designs, while in the United States, Westinghouse was dominant. [...] The early surveys of electric locomotive designs cited here all use the term <b>jackshaft</b> or jack-shaft.|$|E

50|$|Conceptually similar {{linkages}} {{were used}} for the Swiss Ce 6/8II crocodiles. As these had only a single traction motor at each end, the triangular frame was also carried by a blind, unpowered, <b>jackshaft.</b> It was slightly inclined, as the motor <b>jackshaft</b> was above the wheel axis.|$|E

50|$|Two motors were {{mounted in}} both bogie frames. Those two motors drove big cogwheels over both-side {{spring-loaded}} sprockets. The big cogwheels drove a <b>jackshaft.</b> The <b>jackshaft</b> drove a slit coupling rod which drove - over a vertical crosshead - the crank pins {{of the two}} drive-axles of the bogie.|$|E

50|$|The British Rail Class 03 diesel (pictured) is a {{more recent}} example. <b>Jackshafts</b> were used on some diesel-mechanical and diesel-hydraulic {{locomotives}} but were seldom used on diesel-electrics. One exception was the British Rail Class D3/7.|$|R

Power was transmitted to the wheels via a <b>jackshaft,</b> to which the wheels were connected by coupling rods. This <b>jackshaft</b> was located under the cab, and later Drewry DSB class locomotives, Drewry type 'B-2' had a cover-plate over this to prevent staff from being caught by the <b>jackshaft</b> while riding on the cab steps.|$|E

50|$|LMS diesel shunters 7059-7068 were 0-6-0 {{diesel-electric}} shunters {{built by}} Armstrong Whitworth in 1936. Maker's numbers D54-D63. The diesel engine was an Armstrong-Sulzer 6LTD22 of 350 bhp at 875 rpm (400 bhp at 1,000 rpm on overload). There {{was a single}} Crompton Parkinson traction motor with a rating of 231 hp (continuous) or 358 hp (one hour). Final drive was by double reduction gears of 11.1:1 ratio and <b>jackshafts.</b> These locomotives were similar in appearance to LMS 7080-7119 (which became British Rail Class D3/7) although the internal equipment was different. They started work in 1936 and were allocated to Crewe South (7059-7063) and Kingmoor (7064-7068).|$|R
50|$|To {{avoid using}} frame-mounted motors and <b>jackshafts,</b> some {{designers}} {{decided to use}} axle-mounted motors, driving each wheel directly, with the axle forming the spindle of not only the wheels, but also the motor armature itself. This obviously simple system had been used before, but only for low-powered locomotives with lightweight motors. As the wheels and axle, {{and in this case}} the motor too, are unsprung by the suspension, any extra weight here would lead to poor riding qualities. To permit its use for high-horsepower locomotives, the motor was split in two. The armature was formed as part of the axle, but the much heavier field poles and coils were carried on the suspended frame of the locomotive. This setup managed to produce acceptable quality.|$|R
50|$|Where {{the motion}} of the side-rods is purely circular, as on {{locomotives}} driven by <b>jackshafts</b> or geared transmission to one driver, counterweights can balance essentially all of {{the motion of}} the side rods. Where part of the motion is non-circular, for example, the horizontal motion of a piston rod, counterweights on the wheels or drive axles cannot be made to balance the entire assembly perfectly. On a driving wheel supporting both side-rods and the connecting rod to a piston, the counterweight needed to balance the horizontal motion of the piston and connecting rod would be heavier than the counterweight needed to balance the vertical weight of the rods. As a result, a counterweight chosen to minimize the total vibration will not minimize the vertical component of the vibration.|$|R

50|$|A slow-running, large {{series-wound motor}} with 28 poles and two commutators drove the wheels, without any gear reduction, via an {{unsprung}} <b>jackshaft.</b> The <b>jackshaft</b> was linked by a coupling rod to three driving axles {{housed in the}} locomotive frame. The axle base of the driving axles was 2000 mm. The <b>jackshaft</b> was located {{between the first and}} second driving axles. The first and third driving axles were fixed to the frame, the centre one had transverse play to facilitate curve running. The mass was further distributed to two carrying axles that were designed as Adams axles. Control was achieved by means of a variable transformer (Drehtransformator) and power circuit breaker (Lastschalter) with 11 steps.|$|E

[...] With the advent of chain-drive vehicles, the term <b>jackshaft</b> was generally applied to the final intermediate shaft in the drive train, either a chain driven shaft driving pinions that directly engaged teeth {{on the inside of the}} rims of the drive wheels, or the output shaft of the transmission/differential that is linked by chain to the drive wheels.|$|E
