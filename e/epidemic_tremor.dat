5000|$|Tremovirus, {{also known}} <b>epidemic</b> <b>tremor,</b> is a virus genus {{belonging}} to the Picornaviridae family. The genus has one species, Tremovirus A, which is also called Avian encephalomyelitis virus. The first avian picornavirus to have its genome sequenced, it causes <b>epidemic</b> <b>tremor</b> in chickens.|$|E
40|$|A {{characteristic}} of the Afrikaans language is its facile descriptive potential. This has enabled South African farmers to coin most apt and descriptive names for several diseases not necessarily confined to Southern Africa, e. g. the name lamsiekte (literally translated as lame disease) is far more apt than botulism for the condition caused by the toxin of Clostridium botulinum type C and D and is in general use in the literature today; knopvelsiekte which has been freely translated as lumpy skin disease; bewerasiesiekte (literally trembling disease) for <b>epidemic</b> <b>tremor</b> of poultry; and geeldikkop (yellow thick head) for the well-known photosensitivity syndrome in sheep are further examples. In the present instance South African farmers have coined the name "uitpeuloog" (literally bulging or protruding eye). This name, the pronunciation of which may occasion some difficulty to the unaccustomed tongue, is far more apt than the English synonym "bulging eye disease" for the condition {{which is to be}} described and of which protrusion of the eye-ball was at one time believed to be the sole pathognomonic symptom. An additional synonym is blue wildebeest eye (blouwildebeesoog), a term frequently used by farmers because of their association of the disease with wildebeest (Gorgon taurinus taurinus) which in the region concerned, are largely migratory. It will be shown that the disease is caused by the invasion of an aberrant host by larvae of one of the Oestridae and, therefore, the name specific oculo-vascular myiasis is suggested for the disease commonly called uitpeuloog. Later it will be seen that a more fully descriptive name would be oculo-vascular-neuro myiasis but it is felt that this is unnecessarily clumsy.

40|$|An <b>epidemic</b> of <b>tremor</b> {{disease has}} been a serious problem in Chinese mitten crabs, Eriocheir sinensis, in China in recent years. The disease-causing agent was {{previously}} {{considered to be a}} rickettsia-like organism. Here, analysis of the 16 S rRNA gene sequence, light and electron microscopy and cultivation in vitro were used to identify the agent. Sequence analysis of the 16 S rRNA gene found it to have 98 % identity with that of Spiroplasma mirum. The agent was able to be passed through membrane filters with pores 220 nm in diameter and could be cultivated by inoculating the yolk sac of embryonated chicken eggs and M 1 D medium. Rotary motion and flexional movement were seen by light microscopy, and electron microscopy showed that the organism had a helical morphology and lacked a cell wall. The organism produced small colonies with a diameter of 40 – 50 mm after 17 – 25 days of incubation on solid M 1 D medium. The agent was found in blood cells, muscles, nerves and connective tissues of crabs inoculated with a filtrate of yolk sacs or with cultures grown in M 1 D medium, and it was similar in structure to those grown in eggs and cultivation broth. Disease was reproduced by experimental infection with the cultivated organisms. This study has demonstrated that the causative agent of tremor disease in the Chinese mitten crab {{is a member of the}} genus Spiroplasma. This is believed to be the first time a spiroplasma has been found in a crustacean. These findings are not only significant for studies on pathogenic spiroplasmas, but also have implications for studies of freshwater ecology...|$|R
