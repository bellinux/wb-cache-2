50|$|Launched {{in early}} 1970 and {{based largely on}} the Arab policy of France, {{the idea of a}} <b>Euro-Arab</b> <b>dialogue</b> took shape in 1973 {{following}} the Yom Kippur War and the first oil shock, thanks to French President Georges Pompidou and his Foreign Minister, Michel Jobert. The parties were the European Economic Community and the Arab League.|$|E
5000|$|According to Daniel Pipes,Bat Ye'or has {{traced a}} nearly secret history of Europe {{over the past}} thirty years, convincingly showing how the <b>Euro-Arab</b> <b>Dialogue</b> has blossomed from a minor {{discussion}} group into the engine for the continent's Islamization.

5000|$|In Eurabia: The Euro-Arab Axis, Bat Ye'or {{claims that}} Eurabia {{is the result}} of the <b>Euro-Arab</b> <b>Dialogue,</b> based on an {{allegedly}} French-led European policy intended to increase European power against the United States by aligning its interests with those of the Arab countries. During the 1973 oil crisis, the European Economic Community (predecessor of the European Union), had entered into the <b>Euro-Arab</b> <b>Dialogue</b> (EAD) with the Arab League. Ye'or claims it as a primary cause of alleged European hostility to Israel, referring to joint Euro-Arab foreign policies that she characterises as anti-American and anti-Zionist. Ye'or purported a close connection of a Eurabia conspiracy and used the term [...] "dhimmitude", denoting alleged [...] "western subjection to Islam". The term itself is based on a newsletter published in the 1970s by the Comité européen de coordination des associations d'amitié avec le monde Arabe, a Euro-Arab friendship committee.|$|E

50|$|The {{concept was}} coined by Bat Ye'or (pen name of Gisele Littman) {{in the early}} 2000s and is {{described}} in her 2005 book titled Eurabia: The Euro‐Arab Axis. Europe, Ye'or argues, has surrendered to Islam and {{is in a state}} of submission (which she referred to as dhimmitude) in which Europe is forced to deny its own culture, stand silently by in the face of alleged Muslim atrocities, accept Muslim immigration, and pay tribute through various types of economic assistance. According to the theory, the blame rests with a range of groups including communists, fascists, the media, universities, mosques and Islamic cultural centers, European bureaucrats, and the <b>Euro-Arab</b> <b>Dialogue.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{difference}} between these European Arabs and other Europeans often makes them experience a state of cultural detachment, as well as crises of their education, identity and citizenship. This is a modest attempt to examine this phenomenon whilst highlighting the obstacles facing European Arabs and to propose some solutions. Furthermore, it is a call {{to draw attention to}} the European Arabs who have played a successful role in their communities and to utilize them in raising awareness of Arab issues and rectifying the image of Arabs in Europe with the aim of supporting <b>Euro-Arab</b> <b>dialogue</b> and cooperation.There are millions of Arabs living in Europe mostly concentrated in France (about 6,000,000 in 2005) most Arabs in France from Maghreb but also some from Mashreq areas of the Arab world) in France forms the second largest ethnic group after French people of French origin. There are no official figures concerning the demographics of French people of Arab descent because ethnic statistics are forbidden in France.|$|E
50|$|The {{main task}} of the Chamber of Local Authorities is to assess the {{situation}} of local democracy and observe local elections based on the European Charter of Local Self-Government. The Chamber also handles social issues and supports the cooperation of European cities, such as intercultural dialogues, e-democracy, or multiculturalism. It promotes the principles of local democracy outside Europe, inter alia through <b>Euro-Arab</b> <b>dialogue</b> between cities and Euro-Mediterranean co-operation. At its meetings, which take place twice a year during the Plenary Sessions, the Chamber of Local Authorities holds thematic debates {{on issues such as}} the fight against radicalisation, cities against terrorism, migrations, the protection of cultural heritage and adopts recommendations and resolutions..If necessary, the Chamber of Local Authorities can also require a member to write a report to a relevant question of his or her expertise. The Chamber of Local Authorities must examine issues that are relevant to its jurisdiction, namely substantive and current issues relating to the local dimension in Europe, and if necessary may raise a debate during a Congress session. A list of the members of this Chamber can be found here.|$|E
5000|$|Her books Eurabia and Europe, Globalization, and the Coming of the Universal Caliphate {{are about}} the alleged {{relationship}} from the 1970s onwards between the European Union (previously the European Economic Community) and the Arab states. Ye'or argues that Islam, anti-americanism and antisemitism hold sway over European culture and politics {{as a result of}} collaboration between radical Arabs and Muslims on one hand and fascists, socialists, Nazis, antisemitic rulers of Europe on the other. Bat Ye'or popularized the use of term [...] "Eurabia" [...] in the sense of: Eurabia is a geo-political reality envisaged in 1973 through a system of informal alliances between, on the one hand, the nine countries of the European Community (EC) which, enlarged, became the European Union (EU) in 1992 and on the other hand, the Mediterranean Arab countries. The alliances and agreements were elaborated at the top political level of each EC country with the representative of the European Commission, and their Arab homologues with the Arab League's delegate. This system was synchronised under the roof of an association called the <b>Euro-Arab</b> <b>Dialogue</b> (EAD) created in July 1974 in Paris. A working body composed of committees and always presided jointly by a European and an Arab delegate planned the agendas, and organized and monitored the application of the decisions.|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} and theoretically informed examination of European foreign policy making towards the Mediterranean, from 1957 to nowadays. The book {{focuses on the}} reasons and the patterns of Europeans’ actions, with a special emphasis on the early 1970 s and on current times. It analyses how interest in Europe for the Mediterranean has generally arisen out of a shared sense of puzzlement in front of challenges, such as terrorism or migration, originating from the Southern neighbours. The book casts {{new light on the}} role of member states as policy entrepreneurs in European integration, and explains European foreign policy as a way to collectively reconstruct a new understanding of Euro-Mediterranean relations.

40|$|The author {{states that}} the {{conflicts}} in the Mediterranean are put down to interrelated factors –frontier disputes, ethnic-cultural rivalries, low-intensity violence– that make them appear to be “intractable conflicts”, specific to the area, and to which it cannot be automatically applied the model of conflict prevention and management that marked East-West relations during the Cold War. But the author’s analysis goes farther: Biad argues that the initiatives of conflict prevention and management have not done well because of the inadequate definition of objectives (<b>Euro-Arab</b> <b>Dialogue,</b> CSCM,Mediterranean Forum), {{as well as for}} the discrimination against some of the southern members and the lack of clearly identified principles and rules for a security dialogue (WEU, NATO, and the OSCE). The Barcelona Process appears to offer a much broader framework as it does underline the need for common action in the prevention of conflicts based on the principles of transparency and sufficiency. Nevertheless, after an analysis of both which focuses on the military dimension of security, the author reminds us that the Barcelona Declaration does not include institutional mechanisms for the application of these principles...|$|E
40|$|Summary of the thesis: This thesis {{investigates the}} European Commission’s {{approach}} to European Political Cooperation (EPC) from 1969 to 1976. Based on material from EU and state archives, the analysis demonstrates {{the resilience of}} supranational institutions in a period often claimed to be marked by the supremacy of intergovernmentalism following the 1965 - 66 empty chair crisis. By so doing, it sheds {{new light on the}} history of EPC and the history of European integration. The thesis also contributes to a wider theoretical debate on the role of supranational institutions in the integration project between neo-functionalists {{on the one hand and}} intergovernmentalists on the other. In the period in question, the supranational features of the European Community (EC) were challenged. At the summit in The Hague in 1969, the Member States of the EC initiated an intergovernmental structure, an initiative that became the EPC structure from 1970. This structure, separate from the EC, was established in order to further cooperation between the Member States in the areas of foreign policy, and designed to prevent Commission involvement. Based on in-depth studies of two cases, the Conference of Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the <b>Euro-Arab</b> <b>Dialogue,</b> the thesis establishes that the Commission nevertheless managed to acquire a role in the EPC. In so doing, the thesis challenges previous findings on the strict separation of the EC and EPC in this period. The thesis argues that the European Commission was far from being a weak and inconsequential supranational institution, wing-clipped due to the first generation Commission’s prior “violation” of the Member States’ sense of national sovereignty. Rather, a rational actor emerged, characterized by a pragmatic approach that to a certain extent gave the results it sought after, an actor that can be labelled a distinct second generation Commission...|$|E
40|$|The 1970 s are in {{the limelight}} of a growing historiographic attention, {{partly due to the}} recent opening of new archival resources. 1973, in particular, has a special {{interest}} in the historian’s eyes, as many are the events that happened that year: to name but a few, the Chilean coup, the October War, the ensuing oil crisis, the Vietnamese peace treaty. So it is may be not entirely surprising that not much {{attention has been paid to}} the Year of Europe, a nebulous American initiative destined to sum up to nothing practical - as Kissinger himself put it, it was destined to be the Year that never Was. 1 It is my opinion, however, that its failure should not conceal its historical interest. Even though transatlantic relations have sometimes been seen as an uninterrupted history of crisis, 2 in 1973 they reached what could then be considered as their unprecedented nadir. I believe that a thorough analysis of the events that during that year found the US increasingly at odds with the countries of Western Europe is worth carrying out not only to cast a new light on the dynamics of transatlantic relations but also to deepen our comprehension of the internal dynamics of the actors involved, mainly the Nixon administration and a unifying Europe. The Nixon administration had not carefully planned what the initiative actually should have amounted to, and its official announcement appears to have been one of Kissinger’s coups de theatre. Yet the Year of Europe responded to the vital priority of revitalising the relations with Western Europe, crucial ally, for too long neglected. But 1973 did not end with the solemn renewal of the Atlantic Declaration that Kissinger had sought. On the contrary, it saw, for the first time, the countries of the newly enlarged EC engaged in a real, if short-lived, solidarity on foreign policy, which highlighted the Nixon administration’s contradictions regarding European integration. Those, in addition to the numerous tensions that already strained transatlantic relations, gave birth to a downward spiral of incomprehensions and misperceptions, which the unexpected deflagration of the October war seriously worsened. However, even though the tensions did not disappear, the European front soon started to disintegrate, mainly under the strains imposed by the oil crisis. Significant changes in the leadership of the main European countries helped to get the tones back to normal. During the course of 1974 - 5, the substantial failure of the <b>Euro-Arab</b> <b>dialogue,</b> the Gymlich compromise, frequent and serene bilateral meetings bear witness that the worst was over...|$|E
