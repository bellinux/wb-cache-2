5|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>Station</b> Number 4 or <b>Fire</b> <b>Station</b> No. 4 is a {{historic}} <b>fire</b> <b>station</b> located at 474 Broadway in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. The building historically has also been called the Collyer <b>Fire</b> <b>Station.</b> The Queen Anne Style station was built in 1890. It is a -story, hip-roofed rectangular brick building with two brick wings and a bell tower. Constructed of red brick with sandstone trim and sandstone lintels and sills on the windows, the building has a foliate terracotta plaque bearing its name and date of construction. The <b>fire</b> <b>station</b> was closed as a firehouse in 1974, when the current <b>Fire</b> <b>Station</b> Number 4 on Cottage Street opened. The interior of the building was greatly modified to accommodate offices and meeting rooms {{by the time of}} its listing on the national register. In 2014, the building is being used by the Catholic Charities of Providence. <b>Fire</b> <b>Station</b> Number 4 was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E

5|$|After the war the Manchester Fire Brigade {{was again}} municipalised, and reorganised. London Road <b>Fire</b> <b>Station</b> was {{restored}} as {{the headquarters of}} the brigade and became the only <b>fire</b> <b>station</b> serving the city centre. A fire service training centre was established in 1948. At about the same time, the ambulance station closed and was converted into the fire brigade's workshops. The control room was modernised in 1952, becoming the first in the country with equipment to record emergency calls.|$|E
5|$|Cheadle Hulme {{is served}} by a <b>fire</b> <b>station</b> on Turves Road which opened in October 1960. Before this the area made use of a service in Cheadle. An {{ambulance}} station is near the <b>fire</b> <b>station,</b> and the closest public hospital is Stepping Hill Hospital in Hazel Grove. Until the early 2000s the area had a police station which served as the headquarters for the west Stockport area. The building, which opened in 1912, was sold in 2006 and converted into flats.|$|E

40|$|Ankara : The Department of Industrial Engineering and the Institute of Engineering and Science of Bilkent University, 2012. Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 2012. Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 127 - 130. This thesis aims {{to evaluate}} {{the locations of the}} existing <b>fire</b> <b>stations</b> in the city of Ankara. Vertex restricted p-center problem is solved via set covering problem and optimal locations of <b>fire</b> <b>stations</b> are found. We evaluate the <b>fire</b> <b>stations</b> in two ways. The first study aims to locate the same number of <b>fire</b> <b>stations</b> with the existing case. We use an algorithm proposed by Tansel (2011) which solves a finite series of set covering problems to reach the optimal solution of the p-center problem. We use three approaches for the p-center solution which constitutes our first study. In the first approach, we optimally locate the <b>fire</b> <b>stations</b> while keeping their allocation sets the same as those of the existing stations. In the second approach, we locate the <b>fire</b> <b>stations</b> to minimize the maximum of the distances between demand nodes and their closest stations. In the last approach, we take the population of the nodes into account and solve a weighted p-center problem where the weights of demand nodes are defined by their composite populations. We also give a methodology to compute the composite population counts for nodes. In the second study, we locate a minimum number of <b>fire</b> <b>stations</b> while ensuring that each demand node is covered within a pre-determined upper bound on the service time (distance). The bounds are taken to be 4 minutes and 8 minutes in accordance with the internationally accepted norms. Optimally located <b>fire</b> <b>stations</b> are found for both time restrictions. There are two subcases for this study; one of them aims to locate the <b>fire</b> <b>stations</b> without considering the existing <b>fire</b> <b>stations</b> while the other one locates the new <b>fire</b> <b>stations</b> in addition to the existing <b>fire</b> <b>stations.</b> Optimal solutions for all the cases explained above are compared with the existing <b>fire</b> <b>stations</b> with regard to the maximum distances, populations, and covered regions. Assessments are made on existing <b>fire</b> <b>stations</b> by benchmarking their performances against optimal solutions obtained via pcenter or covering solutions as outlined above. Geographical information systems are used for obtaining the demographic data and presenting visual analysis. Balcı, PelinM. S...|$|R

Dorset Fire and Rescue Service provides statutory emergency fire and rescue services for Poole and are based at Poole <b>Fire</b> <b>Station</b> in Creekmoor which opened in 2008. The former <b>fire</b> <b>station</b> on Wimborne Road was demolished in 2008 and was replaced with a joint fire and police divisional headquarters which opened in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to a <b>fire</b> <b>station,</b> the building housed a police station, an ambulance station, a bank, a coroner's court, and a gas-meter testing station. The <b>fire</b> <b>station</b> operated for eighty years, housing the firemen, their families, and the horse-drawn appliances that were replaced by motorised vehicles {{a few years after}} its opening. It was visited by royalty in 1942, in recognition of the brigade's wartime efforts. After the war it became a training centre and in 1952 became the first centre equipped to record emergency calls. However, the <b>fire</b> <b>station</b> became expensive to maintain and after council reorganisation decline set in.|$|E
5|$|London Road <b>Fire</b> <b>Station</b> is {{a former}} <b>fire</b> <b>station</b> in Manchester, England. It was opened in 1906, on a site bounded by London Road, Whitworth Street, Minshull Street South and Fairfield Street. Designed in the Edwardian Baroque style by Woodhouse, Willoughby and Langham in red brick and terracotta, it cost £142,000 to build and was built by J. Gerrard and Sons of Swinton.

5|$|The <b>fire</b> <b>station</b> {{contained}} flats for 32 firemen {{and their}} families and 6 single firemen. Facilities included a laundry, gym, billiards room and children's play-areas. The complex contained stables for the horses that pulled the fire appliances, and a blacksmith's workshop. There were electric bells and lights to alert firemen to an alarm, poles to expedite the firemen's response, suspended harnesses to allow the horses to be harnessed quickly, and electric doors. The <b>fire</b> <b>station</b> was also designed with foresight; the appliance bays were made wide enough to take motorised fire appliances. The station's first motorised fire appliance arrived in 1911, five years after it opened.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} was refurbished in 1955. The exterior had been cleaned {{every year since}} the <b>fire</b> <b>station</b> opened, {{and as a result}} was in pristine condition when the building celebrated its Golden Jubilee on 6 October 1956.|$|E
