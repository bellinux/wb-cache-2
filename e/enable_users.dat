5|$|Rapid {{progress}} in {{hardware and software}} development continued, including projects funded by the European Community. The first commercially available dynamic screen speech generating devices were developed in the 1990s. At the same time synthesized speech was becoming available in more languages. Software programs were developed that allowed the computer-based production of communication boards. High-tech devices have continued to reduce in size and weight, while increasing accessibility and capacities. Modern communication devices can also <b>enable</b> <b>users</b> to access the internet and some {{can be used as}} environmental control devices for independent access of TV, radio, telephone etc.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of development, Nihilistic wanted to support editing of the game by the user-community, having seen the {{benefits}} to the community while working on other games. Staff who worked on Jedi Knight knew the experience of creating a new, customized programming language called COG that gave the programmers the results they wanted but cost time and significant project resources. With Redemption, they wanted to incorporate an existing scripting engine that would more easily <b>enable</b> <b>users</b> to further develop the game instead of developing their own code again, which would consume months of development time. The team tested various languages, but became aware of another studio, Rebel Boat Rocker, which was receiving attention for its use of the Java language. Speaking to that studio's lead programmer Billy Zelsnak, Nihilistic decided to experiment with Java, having little prior knowledge of it. The language successfully integrated into the NOD engine without problems, providing a standardized and freely distributable scripting engine. Several designers were trained to use Java {{to allow them to}} build the several hundred scripts required to drive the game's storyline.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, Steam {{began to}} accept player reviews of games. Other users can {{subsequently}} rate these reviews as helpful, humorous, or otherwise unhelpful, {{which are then}} used to highlight the most useful reviews on the game's Steam store page. Steam also aggregates these reviews and <b>enable</b> <b>users</b> to sort products based on this feedback while browsing the store. In May 2016, Steam further broke out these aggregations between all reviews overall and those made more recently in the last 30 days, a change Valve acknowledges to how game updates, particularly those in Early Access, can alter {{the impression of a}} game to users. To prevent observed abuse of the review system by developers or other third-party agents, Valve modified the review system in September 2016 to discount review scores for a game from users that activated the product through a product key rather than directly purchased by the Steam score, though their reviews remain visible. Alongside this, Valve announced that it would end business relations with any developer or publisher that they have found to be abusing the review system.|$|E

25|$|Open Virtual Platforms (OVP) {{includes}} the freely available for non-commercial use simulator OVPsim, {{a library of}} models of processors, peripherals and platforms, and APIs which <b>enable</b> <b>users</b> {{to develop their own}} models. The models in the library are open source, written in C, and include the MIPS 4K, 24K, 34K, 74K, 1004K, 1074K, M14K, microAptiv, interAptiv, proAptiv 32 bit cores and the MIPS 64bit 5K range of cores. These models are created and maintained by Imperas and in partnership with MIPS Technologies have been tested and assigned the MIPS-Verified (tm) mark. Sample MIPS-based platforms include both bare metal environments and platforms for booting unmodified Linux binary images. These platforms–emulators are available as source or binaries and are fast, free for non-commercial usage, and are easy to use. OVPsim is developed and maintained by Imperas and is very fast (hundreds of million of instructions per second), and built to handle multicore homogeneous and heterogeneous architectures and systems.|$|E
