40|$|In {{the last}} 15 years a {{significant}} increase in greenhouse area has occurred in Mexico, from a modest 50 hectares in 1990 to over 2, 000 hectares in 2004. The rapid increase in greenhouse area is a result of an attractive export market, USA. Mexican summer midday temperatures are well above crop optimum and cooling is needed if heat stress induced crop growth reduction is to be prevented. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effectiveness and feasibility of greenhouse cooling systems for tomato culture under desert, <b>humid</b> <b>tropic</b> and temperate Mexican weather conditions. These climate regions are represented by Mexicali, Merida and Huejutla respectively. The cooling systems included a variety of passive and active systems, which through an engineering design methodology were combined to suit the climate conditions of the 3 regions. The evaluation was conducted via simulation, taking into account the most important temperature effects on crop growth and yield. The results showed that the cooling systems were effective in decreasing heat stress to plants. Investment costs of greenhouse with cooling equipment were under USD 50 m- 2 and operational costs were under USD 10 m- 2 for all equipment combinations and treatments except for the <b>humid</b> <b>tropic</b> climate of Merida. Solutions for Merida were both economically and physically not feasible due to too high humidity levels. This model study clearly indicates that cooling is feasible in desert and moderate climate regions of Mexico but in <b>humid</b> <b>tropic</b> climate regions feasibility is a problem. Application of design methodology and design evaluation with help of simulation greatly contributed to pointing out effective and non-effective solutions to reduce heat stress in hot climates...|$|R

40|$|A {{multidisciplinary}} {{study was}} carried out to understand the interactions between biotic and abiotic processes in granite weathering in ice-free areas of Northern Victoria Land, Antarctica. Examples of tafoni, pits and grooves were analyzed, focusing on their morphometry, infills, weathering rind types and vegetation patterns. Surface and subsurface temperatures and incoming radiation were measured to characterize microclimatic conditions. In addition, microscopic, SEM and X-ray diffraction analyses of granite were carried out. These analyses indicate that, under present conditions, mechanical weathering is the main process active {{in the formation of}} tafoni, which post-date pits and grooves. In these forms, granular disintegration is mainly induced by chasmoendolithic lichens, salt and thermal stress associated with the dilatation coefficients of different granite-forming minerals. The overall morphology of pits and grooves indicates that they originate from water erosion. In the former, mechanical weathering prevails, caused by epilithic lichens, by freeze-thaw events, and by salt, while only the first two processes are active in the grooves. The intensity of these processes is less effective than in tafoni and on the outer surfaces, suggesting that pits and grooves are inherited features, possibly generated {{in the same way as}} landforms occurring on granite in the <b>humid</b> <b>tropic...</b>|$|R
40|$|With {{respect to}} the current {{vulnerable}} climatic condition, water quality has {{become a matter of}} the highest worldwide concern. Rainwater harvesting is the most acceptable solution for overcoming this problem. Among various rainwater harvesting systems, green roof rainwater harvesting is a significant tool for improving the standard of living for rapidly growing populations in the whole world, in terms of both water demand and protecting the environment from pollution. This paper assesses the water quality parameter (dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, conductivity, and temperature) of rainwater harvesting from green roofs in <b>humid</b> <b>tropic</b> center under tropical climate conditions. It shows that the values of electric conductivity are always within Class I according to Interim National Water Quality Standards (INWQS) and Water Quality Index (WQI). Depletions of DO and pH values were observed for the green roof runoff, and the runoff quality ranged between Class I and III under INWQS and WQI. Lower value of pH indicates that harvested rainwater from green roofs is more acidic than the standard neutral value. Harvested water must be processed through general water treatment methods like filtration, disinfection, and through reverse osmosis storage tank.

The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the relations between plant growth and {{chemical and}} physical fertility indicators of an Ultisol developed from sediments of the Itapecuru Formation in Central-Northern state of Maranhão, Brazil. An experiment was established with randomized block design, four replicates, and six treatments: 6. 0 Mg ha– 1 mulch with or without liming; 3. 0 Mg ha– 1 mulch with or without liming; bare soil with or without liming. Determinations in the plants included leaf area index, net assimilation rate, and the yield parameters: mean number and weight of ears, 100 -kernel weight, harvest index, and total grain yield. Soil determinations consisted of bulk density variations on the surface and at 20 cm, effective porosity evolution after intentional flooding, and alterations in chemical indicators such as cation exchange capacity, bases saturation, organic carbon, and macronutrient contents. Mulching and liming were equivalent with regard to their influence on leaf area yield, but mulching was more important for corn productivity because of its greater effect on net photosynthesis...|$|R

Leaf litter was sampled under clonal eucalypt stands aged 2, 4 and 6 years on hillslopes and footslopes. Soil and soil+litter samples were incubated at two levels of soil moisture, temperature and fertilization. C-CO 2 emissions from soil measured during 106 days were higher at 32 °C than at 23 °C, mainly for the 2 -yr-old stand on footslope. When leaf litter was added on soils, C-CO 2 emissions were eight times higher, mainly on footslopes, with no effect of stand age.
