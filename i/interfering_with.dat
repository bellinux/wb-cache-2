5|$|Dudley was {{credited}} with discovering that a toxic component of tobacco smoke is carbon monoxide (which poisons the blood by <b>interfering</b> <b>with</b> oxygen's ability to bind to hemoglobin). Dudley rejected the popularly held opinion that cigarette smoke was harmful due to the adulteration of the tobacco, e. g. with opium. His experiments showed the toxic agent to be carbon monoxide, resulting alike from cigarette, pipe, or cigar.|$|E

5|$|Alligator weed was {{introduced}} to the United States from South America. It takes root in shallow water, <b>interfering</b> <b>with</b> navigation, irrigation, and flood control. The alligator weed flea beetle and two other biological controls were released in Florida, greatly reducing the amount of land covered by the plant. Another aquatic weed, the giant salvinia (Salvinia molesta) is a serious pest, covering waterways, reducing water flow and harming native species. Control with the salvinia weevil (Cyrtobagous salviniae) and the salvinia stem-borer moth (Samea multiplicalis) is effective in warm climates, and in Zimbabwe, a 99% control of the weed was obtained over a two-year period.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method that}} has been used to {{establish}} the date of eruption is tree-ring dating. Tree-ring data has shown that a large event <b>interfering</b> <b>with</b> normal tree growth in North America occurred during 1629–1628 (±65 years)BCE. Evidence of a climatic event around 1628BCE has been found in studies of growth depression of European oaks in Ireland and of Scotch pines in Sweden. Bristlecone pine frost rings also indicate a date of 1627BCE, supporting the late 1600sBCE dating. Procedural changes in how ice cores are interpreted would bring that data more in line with the dendrochronological numbers.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 1920s and early 1930s, the {{politicians}} became less {{satisfied with the}} solution. Kjeller was considered {{too far away from}} the city center (about , but along the mainline railway), while travel to Gressholmen needed to be made by ferry. The politicians also wanted to have a combined land- and seaplane airport, and it had become clear that serving Gressholmen was <b>interfering</b> <b>with</b> ship traffic. A committee was established to look into the matter. While considering many locations, it made detail surveys of only two places: Ekeberg, located southeast of the city center, and Fornebu, to the southwest.|$|E

40|$|The place {{conditioning}} paradigm {{has been}} used to assess the antinausea potential of drugs in non-emetic animal species. The present experiments were designed to determine the potential of A 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to alleviate both conditioned and unconditioned sickness in rats (Rattus norvegiens). The results in the present study suggest that when the place aversion is strong (Experiment 1), THC may <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> the establishment; however when the aversion is weak (Experiments 2 and 3), THC may <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> the expression. Also, when administered during acquisition of a strong amphetamine-induced place preference, THC also seems to <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> the establishment of the preference. Therefore it appears that when the place association is strong, THC may <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> the associative process itself, but when the place association is weak THC may <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> the conditioned sickness or the retrieval of the association...|$|R
50|$|The device can be {{understood}} by reference to the problem to the right, a mate in two moves (white moves first, and must checkmate black in two moves against any defence).

This <b>interferes</b> <b>with</b> black's rook and bishop, and whichever of those pieces takes the knight, it will <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> the other—this is the Novotny idea at its most basic.

5|$|Studies {{suggest that}} the Af9 protein acts as a {{repressor}} of Tbr1 in the upper layers of the six-layer developing cerebral cortex, thereby confining Tbr1 to the lower cortical layers (preplate, subplate, layer VI). This process is regulated through interaction of Af9 with the methyltransferase DOT1L, which methylates histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79). Af9 association with DOT1L enhances methylation of H3K79 at the TBR1 transcription start site, thereby <b>interfering</b> <b>with</b> RNA polymerase II (RNAPolII) activity and reducing TBR1 expression. Mutants of Af9 experience increased dimethylation of H3K79 and increased TBR1 expression.|$|E
