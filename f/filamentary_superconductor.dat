40|$|A circuit {{model is}} {{presented}} for a twisted <b>filamentary</b> <b>superconductor</b> {{exposed to a}} pulsed parallel external field. Experimental results are also reported on the measurements of transient loss voltage and its change due to transport current. The measurements are in reasonable agreement with that predicted by the postulated model. (auth...|$|E
40|$|The {{engineering}} practicality of {{a persistent}} high-field superconducting solenoid cryostat as a magnetic suspension and balance system (MSBS) for wind-tunnel testing of aircraft and missile models is examined. The test apparatus {{is a simple}} solenoid of <b>filamentary</b> NbTi <b>superconductor</b> with a cupronickel matrix. The apparatus, with a length-to-diameter ratio of 6 to 1 and a radius of 32 mm, used a 0. 25 mm wire with a critical current of 27 A in an external field of 6 T. The total heat inleak of 150 mW was achieved. Helium boiloff rates were tested over a range of operating conditions, including pitch attitudes from 10 deg nose down to 90 deg nose up; the rate was estimated as low, but the aerodynamic acceptability of venting gaseous helium has not been determined. It is shown that {{the effectiveness of the}} concept increases with increasing scale, and performance in excess of that of conventional ferromagnets is achievable with reduction in size and costs, and with aptness to transonic wind-tunnel testing.

40|$|Due to the {{competition}} of two anion orders, (TMTSF) 2 ReO 4, presents a phase coexistence between semiconducting and metallic (superconducting) regions (filaments or droplets) {{in a wide range}} of pressure. In this regime, the superconducting upper critical field for H parallel to both c* and b' axes present a linear part at low fields followed by a divergence above a cross-over field. This cross-over corresponds to the 3 D- 2 D decoupling transition expected in <b>filamentary</b> or granular <b>superconductors.</b> The sharpness of the transition also demonstrates that all filaments are of similar sizes and self organize in a very ordered way. The distance between the filaments and their cross-section are estimated. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
