40|$|In {{particulate}} food systems the {{rheological behavior}} is {{strongly influenced by}} particle-particle interactions. Recently, we have shown that adding {{a small amount of}} an immiscible fluid to a suspension can lead to particle bridging and network formation [1]. This effect occurs both if the secondary fluid wets the particles better or worse than the bulk fluid. The capillary bridging phenomenon can be used to stabilize particle suspensions and precisely tune their rheological properties. This allows stable food products to be created without emulsifiers or stabilizing agents, as shown here for starch and cocoa suspensions [2]. The stability and the strength of suspensions highly depends on the surface properties of the particles and the wetting and re-wetting behavior of the fluids with the particles. Even a slight shift in wetting behavior results in a strong change in flow behavior. In oil continuous suspensions of slightly hydrophilic particles that have been conditioned over water, the network induced by capillary bridges forms spontaneously and results in the same yield stress as if the water is added to the suspension of dry particles. This demonstrates that, in contrast to Pickering emulsions, the formation of capillary suspensions is an energetically driven phenomenon. The presence of aqueous capillary bridges between cocoa particles also improves the heat stability of model chocolate systems. Water continuous suspensions can potentially be used to design novel low fat food products. We have modified suspensions of cocoa particles in water with trace amounts of an appropriate oil to achieve texture and flow properties of regular fat continuous cocoa spreads.

40|$|This paper aims to {{contribute}} to the methodological toolbox of “pedagogy-driven corpus-based research” (Gabrielatos, 2006), that is, research which is situated at the intersection of language description, pedagogical lexicogrammar, and pedagogical materials evaluation (e. g. Harwood, 2005; Hunston & Francis, 1998; Kennedy, 1992; Owen, 1993; Römer, 2004, 2005). The contribution of the present paper mainly lies in proposing a method of triangulating the corpus-based evaluation of lexicogrammatical information in EFL coursebooks, by way of examining a relevant corpus sample of learner written output. More precisely, Gabrielatos (2006) compared the information and examples on if-conditionals in eleven coursebooks for advanced EFL learners with a random sample of 781 if-conditionals from the written BNC (Aston & Burnard, 1998) – using BNCweb (see Hoffmann et al., 2008). The analysis revealed that the common-ground typology – i. e. the information presented in all the coursebooks examined – accounted for just over one-quarter (27. 8 %) of the if-conditionals in the BNC sample. More importantly, even if the information given in all the sample coursebooks were collated to produce an inclusive typology, it would account for less than three-quarters (72. 5 %) of the if-conditionals in the BNC sample. Even lower proportions were revealed when the sample of coursebooks included both intermediate and advance coursebooks (Gabrielatos, 2003). The observed under-representation of the variety of if-conditionals in the coursebooks mainly hinged on the following: •The coursebook typologies predominantly focused on conditionals with apodoses expressing degress of likelihood, ignoring or backgrounding conditionals with apodoses expressing deontic or volitional senses. Similalry, coursebooks ignored the type of conditionals termed “indirect” (Quirk et al., 1985), “speech act” (Sweetser, 1990), or “pragmatic” (Athanasiadou & Dirven, 1997) – e. g. Out {{of the corner of his}} eye he saw Hammond start forward. “But you promised [...] . ” Spatz interrupted Hammond, his face hard. “I promised nothing, if you recall. ” [GUG 121]. •Patterns presented as ‘exceptions’ or ‘special cases’ in the coursebooks proved to be too frequent to be accurately described as such. For example, the coursebooks present Past tense marking with past time reference in protases as a special case – stressing its epistemic interpretation. However, in the BNC sample, one-third of Past tense marking in protases expressed past time. •Modal marking in ‘rules’ and examples was predominantly by way of central and (less so) peripheral modals; lexical modal markers were ignored in both rules and examples. On the basis of the above results, it was hypothesised in the present study that learner written production – when compared to similar texts in the written BNC – would be characterised by the following: a) Under-representation of indirect conditionals. b) Among direct conditionals, an over-representation of conditionals with apodoses expressing degrees of likelihood, and a corresponding under-representation of other types. c) Lower proportion of Past tense marking with past time reference in protases. d) Smaller extent of modal marking in protases. e) Over-representation of central modals. The study aimed to compare the if-conditionals in the random sample from the written BNC with those in a random sample from ICLE (Granger et al., 2002). However, ICLE only contains argumentative essays, whereas the written BNC is richer in text types. For reasons of comparability, only the instances from academic texts, essays and editorials in the BNC sample were considered – resulting in a sample of 195 if-conditionals. Therefore, a random sample of 200 instances was drawn from ICLE – using CQPweb (Hardie, forthcoming). Each if-conditional was annotated for its type, using the typology developed in Gabrielatos (2010), as well as the modal marker and the type of modality in the protases and apodoses. Only hypotheses ‘b’, ‘c’ and, to some extent, ‘d’ were supported by the results – in the other two respects learner production in ICLE was comparable to that of the native speakers in the BNC. However, it would be premature to conclude that the explicit information in coursebooks has limited influence on learner production. ICLE contains the written production of learners having a variety of L 1 s, and coming from a variety of educational contexts, which can be expected to employ different pedagogical materials and/or instructional approaches. Therefore, the possibility cannot be discounted that the picture emerging from the present analysis may hide country-specific and/or L 1 -specific variation. References Athanasiadou, A. & R.

To examine whether mitochondrial dysfunction is {{a feature of}} this organic acidemia, a background-modified Mut-knockout mouse model was constructed and used to examine mitochondrial ultrastructure and respiratory chain function in the tissues that manifest pathology in humans. In parallel, the liver from a patient with mut methylmalonic acidemia was studied in a similar fashion. Megamitochondria formed early in life in the hepatocytes of the Mut−/− animals and progressively enlarged. Liver extracts prepared from the mutants at multiple time points displayed respiratory chain dysfunction, with diminished cytochrome c oxidase activity and reduced intracellular glutathione compared to control littermates. Over time, the exocrine pancreas and proximal tubules of the kidney also exhibited megamitochondria, and older mutant mice eventually developed tubulointerstitial renal disease. The patient liver displayed similar morphological and enzymatic findings as observed in the murine tissues. These murine and human studies establish that megamitochondria formation with respiratory chain dysfunction occur in a tissue-specific fashion in methylmalonic acidemia and suggest treatment approaches based on improving mitochondrial function and ameliorating the effects of oxidative stress. —Chandler, R.

40|$|Proteomics is {{a rapidly}} growing {{research}} area within bioinformatics which focuses on quantification of peptide concentrations and on the identification of proteins and peptides. In quantitative proteomics the identification of biomarkers from peptide concentrations is important for diagnostic purposes and treatment of diseases. The goal {{of this paper is}} to facilitate research in this area, by providing a test bed for comparison of 1 D curve registration methods. This is done in a novel way, by providing not only curves, but also an answer key as to how the peaks should align. In the following papers a number of approaches to this problem are given, and the answer key provides unusually useful insights into how the methods compare. For this reason, we consider proteomics mass spectrometry profiles which are part of a larger study into the identification of biomarkers in Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML). For these profiles large ion counts result in large peaks, but these peaks may occur at different retention times for different profiles. The first step in the quantification of peptides in proteomics profiles is the alignment of the 1 D curves of total ion count (TIC). The paper includes a description of proteomics mass spectrometry profiling, and considers profiles from five patients with AML. It outlines the preprocessing steps we applied to the multiple TIC samples from each patient, and introduces the reference peptides. The retention times of the reference peptides are known for each profile, and using these times as an answer key makes the 1 D TIC curves a particularly informative test bed for curve registration.

To {{gain an understanding of}} HCMV early gene activation, we studied the effect of each of the three major IE proteins, IE 72, IE 86, and IE 55, on the HCMV DNA polymerase gene (pol; UL 54) promoter. In transient-expression assays, the IE 86 protein alone was able to transactivate the pol promoter, but IE 72 and IE 55 were not, in permissive U 373 MG cells. However, we were unable to detect IE 86 -mediated transactivation in nonpermissive HeLa or C 33 -A cells. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), we found that expression of the IE 86 protein in U 373 MG cells resulted in specific binding of a DNA complex to an inverted-repeat element, IR 1, of the pol promoter. Antibody supershifting and EMSA-Western blotting experiments further showed that IE 86 and the cellular transcription factor Sp 1 were components of the IR 1 DNA-binding complex. Furthermore, we found that binding of DNA by Sp 1 was dramatically increased in the presence of IE 86. Interestingly, this IE 86 -induced DNA-binding activity of Sp 1 was inhibited by a repressor activity presented in HeLa cells. In summary, our study suggests that a viral regulatory protein can modulate the DNA binding activity of a cellular transcription factor, resulting in cell-specific transactivation of viral genes...|$|R

As MGH grapples with these challenges, it is imperative to understand precisely what is driving the congestion. In this thesis, will show there has been significant volume growth and ii) study whether these visits resulted in inpatient admissions that could have utilized alternative care pathways while preserving patient safety and quality of care. After collaborating with hospital staff to analyze ED patient volume in 2015, we conclude that avoidable admission candidates who transferred to MGH from other facilities occupied nearly 6 percent of the hospital's General Medicine capacity. Furthermore, the utilization growth associated with these patients was equivalent to 1. 3 percent of all General Medicine beds. meaning transfers alone can account for the overcrowding symptoms mentioned above. In a second analysis. applying unsupervised and supervised learning methods to short-stay inpatients reveals that even generalized order data can reliably predict conditions associated with avoidable admissions.

For the human blood fluke, Schistosoma mansoni, the developmental period that constitutes {{the transition from}} miracidium to sporocyst within the molluscan host involves major alterations in morphology and physiology. Although the genetic basis for this transformation process is not well understood, {{it is likely to}} be accompanied by changes in gene expression. In an effort to reveal genes involved in this process, we performed a DNA microarray analysis of expressed mRNAs between miracidial and 4 d old in vitro-cultured mother sporocyst stages of S. mansoni. Fluorescently labeled, dsDNA targets were synthesized from miracidia and sporocyst total RNA and hybridized to oligonucleotide DNA microarrays containing 7335 S. mansoni sequences. Fluorescence intensity ratios were statistically compared between five biologically replicated experiments to identify particular transcripts that displayed stage-associated expression within miracidial and sporocyst mRNA populations. A total of 361 sequences showed stage-associated expression in miracidia, while 273 probes displayed sporocyst-associated expression. Differentially expressed mRNAs were annotated with gene ontology terminology based on BLAST homology using high throughput gene ontology functional annotation toolkit (HT-GO-FAT) and clustered using the GOblet GO browser software. A subset of genes displaying stage-associated expression by microarray analyses was verified utilizing real-time quantitative PCR.

30|$|In {{order to}} make use of silicon {{nanowires}} (Si NWs) [1] in nano-devices, selective doping to form p n junctions or p and n wells is a necessity. Till date, a host of devices with selectively doped Si NWs have been demonstrated [1, 2]. Out of them, axial p n[3] and p n i[4] junction in Si NWs have shown the potential to be used as solar cells. However, axial p n junctions in NWs grown by the vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) technique have mostly been fabricated by purely in-situ doping [3, 5, 6]. It has been observed that a pure in-situ doping to fabricate an axial junction may result in unwanted lateral doping [6] due to unavoidable dopant incorporations through the NW sidewalls by vaporsolid (VS) growth. On the other hand, ion implantation [7] which is the most widely used doping technique in very large scale integration (VLSI) fabrication can form well-confined doped regions when appropriately used with masking. Ion implantation has been used to fabricate the doped source and drain contacts [8] as well as the channel [9] in Si NW-based field effect transistors (FETs). But one of the principal reasons for not extensively using ion implantation to fabricate axial junctions in vertical NWs is possible irrecoverable implantation damages [10] that were observed in other low dimensional structures such as a FinFET [11]. However, we have shown [12] that by choosing appropriate ion doses and energies, it is possible to uniformly dope vertical Si NWs of diameter in the range of 100 nm without leaving any residual structural defects in them. Separately, we have also demonstrated in-situ doping of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)-grown Si NWs [13]. <b>S.</b> <b>Hoffmann</b> et al. [14] have realized a p n junction in a Si NW purely by ion implantation. However, co-diffusion of acceptors and donors during annealing after such dual implantations of different ions (boron and phosphorus) often lead to the formation of acceptor–donor complexes [15, 16] that can anomalously increase the solubility of the donors in the acceptor-rich segments, thus affecting the p– and n– profiles.|$|R
40|$|Screening for {{specific}} biomarkers of early-stage detection {{of ovarian cancer}} is a major health priority due to the asymptomatic nature and poor survival characteristic of the disease. We utilised two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 DE) to identify differentially expressed proteins in the serum of ovarian cancer patients that may be useful as biomarkers of this disease. In this study, 38 ovarian cancer patients at different pathological grades (grade 1 (n= 6), grade 2 (n= 8) and grade 3 (n= 24)) were compared to a control group of eight healthy women. Serum samples were treated {{with a mixture of}} Affigel-Blue and protein A (5 : 1) for 1 h to remove high abundance protein (e. g. immunoglobulin and albumin) and were displayed using 11 cm, pH 4 - 7 isoelectric focusing strips for the first dimension and 10 % acrylamide gel electrophoresis for the second dimension. Protein spots were visualised by SYPRO-Ruby staining, imaged by FX-imager and compared and analysed by PDQuest software. A total of 24 serum proteins were differentially expressed in grade 1 (P< 0. 05), 31 in grade 2 (P< 0. 05) and 25 in grade 3 (P< 0. 05) ovarian cancer patients. Six of the protein spots that were significantly upregulated in all groups of ovarian cancer patients were identified by nano-electrospray quadrupole quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (n-ESIQ(q) TOFMS) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS) as isoforms of haptoglobin- 1 precursor (HAP 1), a liver glycoprotein present in human serum. Further identification of the spots at different pathological grades was confirmed by Western blotting using monoclonal antibody against a haptoglobin epitope contained within HAP 1. Immunohistochemical localisation of HAP 1 -like activity was present in malignant ovarian epithelium and stroma but strong immunostaining was present in blood vessels, areas with myxomatous stroma and vascular spaces. No tissue localisation of HAP 1 -like immunoreactivity was observed in normal ovarian surface epithelium. These data highlight the need to assess circulating concentration of HAP 1 in the serum of ovarian cancer patients and evaluate its potential as a biomarker in the early diagnosis of ovarian cancer.
