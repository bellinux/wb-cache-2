30|$|After {{identifying}} all the categories, {{we counted}} {{the number of}} occurrences in the analyzed papers, aiming to identify which categories were the most cited. In order to establish relationships between the identified categories, we created a graph for each critical success factor. We used the connector “it is a property of” to relate the <b>category</b> <b>codes</b> of properties of critical success factors with the <b>category</b> <b>codes</b> of critical success factors. Also, we used the connectors “it is evidence of the presence of” and “it is evidence of the absence of” to relate the <b>category</b> <b>codes</b> of the findings with the <b>category</b> <b>codes</b> of properties of critical success factors. These connectors show a positive and negative variation, respectively, {{in the presence of}} a factor.|$|R

40|$|Reaction {{time task}} rule {{congruency}} effects (RT-TRCEs) reflect faster responses to stimuli {{for which the}} competing task rules indicate the same correct response than to stimuli indicating conflicting responses. The authors tested the hypothesis that RT-TRCE reflects activated overlearned response <b>category</b> <b>codes</b> in long-term memory (such as up or left). The results support the hypothesis by showing that (a) RT-TRCE was absent for tasks for which there were no response codes ready beforehand, (b) RT-TRCE was present after these tasks were practiced, and (c) these practice effects were found only if the tasks permitted forming abstract response <b>category</b> <b>codes.</b> The increase in the RT-TRCE with response slowness, found only for familiar tasks, suggests that the abstract response <b>category</b> <b>codes</b> may be verbal or linguistic in these cases. The results are discussed in relation to task-switching theories and prefrontal functions...|$|R
5000|$|Bits 8-14 of {{the control}} code are a 7-bit <b>category</b> <b>code</b> {{indicating}} the type of source equipment, and bit 15 is the [...] "L-bit", which (for most <b>category</b> <b>codes)</b> indicates whether copy-restricted audio is original (may be copied once) or a copy (does not allow recording again). The L-bit is only used if bit 2 is zero, meaning copy-restricted audio. The L-bit polarity depends on the category, with recording allowed if it is 1 for DVD-R and DVR-RW, but 0 for CD-R, CD-RW, and DVD. For plain CD-DA (ordinary nonrecordable CDs), the L-bit is not defined, and recording is prevented by alternating bit 2 {{at a rate of}} 4-10 Hz.|$|R

An interview guide was set based on the categories, and tips were provided for conducting interviews and performing the related codification in each class after analyzing the interviews. In the “professional” <b>category,</b> 4 <b>codes</b> of "futile care", "stereotyped care", "fear of distrust" and "moral distress"; in the “patient and family” <b>category,</b> 2 <b>codes</b> of "selfishness vs. sacrifice" and "protection of human dignity"; in the “moral” <b>category,</b> one <b>code</b> of "lack of understanding of the meaning of morality"; in the “legal” <b>category,</b> 2 <b>codes</b> of " fear of the law" and "fear of accusation of the nurse "; in the “religious” <b>category,</b> 3 <b>codes</b> of, "fate", "forgiveness of sins", and "miracle"; and in the “economic” <b>category,</b> one <b>code</b> of "money as a facilitating or hindering factor" were extracted.

40|$|Abstract: Brand posts are concise and {{recurrent}} updates {{created by}} brands and {{sent out to}} their followers on social media. Brand posts play a crucial linking role by connecting brands to their customers and fans on a daily basis. Brand posts represent a rich form of communication that convey various brand meaning and experiences using multiple media formats. Despite this, however, brand posts have not been subjected to formalized analyses in the literature. Accordingly, {{the purpose of this}} study is to conduct a formalized analysis of brand posts and propose a systematic framework to categorize them. With this aim, the study performed qualitative content analysis involving three interrelated coding procedures. First, the study reviewed the relevant literature to identify pre-existing <b>coding</b> <b>categories</b> (deductive <b>coding).</b> Second, the study drew together systematic inferences from a purposive sample of brand posts (n =  371) to derive new <b>coding</b> <b>categories</b> (inductive <b>coding).</b> Finally, the study implemented a double-coding procedure on a probabilistic sample of brand posts (n =  249) to validate the initial <b>coding</b> <b>categories</b> (validation <b>coding).</b> Together, the three coding procedures produced 12 exhaustive and mutually exclusive categories of brand posts. The proposed categorization offers a comprehensive framework to think about brand posts. For marketers, it provides guidance to create the stream of content necessary to stimulate daily customer interaction on social media. For researchers, it offers a solid conceptual foundation to categorize, code and model brand posts...|$|R

In disaster situations, victims are grouped into four <b>categories,</b> <b>coded</b> red, yellow, green or no color. Then, the image of each victim is partitioned into sub-blocks (Kavitha et al. 2011) by dividing up the whole image into pieces (or chunks). For efficient delivery of both high-and low-priority pieces, we make each piece have a different data size and number of pixels depending on the color code assigned to the piece.|$|R
