60|$|I {{climbed the}} ladder {{on the side}} of the for'ard house (which house contained, as I discovered, the forecastle, the galley, and the donkey- engine room), and went part way along the bridge to a {{position}} by the foremast, where I could observe the crew <b>heaving</b> <b>up</b> <b>anchor.</b> The Britannia was alongside, and we were getting under way.|$|R
60|$|The {{windlass}} {{is simply}} a horizontal, instead of a perpendicular capstan. Its sole purpose is for <b>heaving</b> <b>up</b> the <b>anchor,</b> and it is placed close to {{the bow of the}} ship.|$|R
40|$|When a ship {{leaves the}} wharf <b>heaving</b> <b>up</b> the <b>anchor,</b> {{it is very}} {{important}} for captain to estimate the tracks of bow and stern. Using Nansei Maru and Keiten Maru, I measured the tracks of bow and stern and got the following results: 1. The track of bow has no relation with the speed of <b>heaving</b> <b>up</b> the <b>anchor.</b> 2. The ratio of the maximum length of swinging out of stern to ship’s length over all (K_{max}/L_{OA}) is proportional to the cable direction (θ) and its ratio is calculated by the following expression; Nansei Maru K_{max}/L_{OA}= 0. 00275 θ- 0. 0103. Keiten Maru K_{max}/L_{OA}= 0. 00271 θ- 0. 0182. 3. In case that the swinging out of stern is greatest, the turning angle of the ship (α) is as follows; Nansei Maruα= 0. 5554 θ- 0. 349. Keiten Maru α= 0. 5573 θ- 0. 418. and in practice we can get the turning angle by the following expression, α= 5 / 9 θ. 4. In case that the cable direction is 63 °~ 73 °, the trace of the bow is at the right angle with the bow and aft midship line in the early stage of <b>heaving</b> <b>up</b> the <b>anchor.</b> ...|$|R

As I hinted before, this {{whalebone}} marquee was never pitched except in port; and {{on board the}} Pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known {{to be the next}} thing to <b>heaving</b> <b>up</b> the <b>anchor.</b>|$|R
2500|$|A boatswain's skills {{may include}} cargo rigging, winch operations, deck maintenance, working aloft, and other duties {{required}} during deck operations. The boatswain is {{well versed in}} the care and handling of lines, and has knowledge of knots, hitches, bends, whipping, and splices as needed to perform tasks such as mooring a vessel. The boatswain typically operates the ship's windlasses when letting go and <b>heaving</b> <b>up</b> <b>anchors.</b> [...] Moreover, a boatswain may {{be called upon to}} lead firefighting efforts or other emergency procedures encountered on board. [...] Effective boatswains are able to integrate their seafarer skills into supervising and communicating with members of deck crew with often diverse backgrounds.|$|R
60|$|Of course I drank. I drank with {{my guests}} and hosts. Also, I drank by myself. Doing the work of five men, I thought, {{entitled}} me to drink. Alcohol was good {{for a man who}} over-worked. I noted its effect on my small crew, when, breaking their backs and hearts at <b>heaving</b> <b>up</b> <b>anchor</b> in forty fathoms, they knocked off gasping and trembling at the end of half an hour and had new life put into them by stiff jolts of rum. They caught their breaths, wiped their mouths, and went to it again with a will. And when we careened the Snark and had to work in the water to our necks between shocks of fever, I noted how raw trade rum helped the work along.|$|R
6000|$|As I {{leaned over}} to <b>heave</b> <b>up</b> the <b>anchor,</b> I saw the {{bonefish}} flashing nearer. At that instant of thrilling excitement and suspense I could not trust my eyesight. There he was, swimming heavily, and he looked three feet long, thick and dark and heavy. I got the <b>anchor</b> <b>up</b> just as he passed under the canoe. Maybe I did not revel in pride of my quickness of thought and action! ...|$|R
60|$|But {{this is not}} all. New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, after {{at various}} times {{creating}} great havoc among the boats of different vessels, were finally gone in quest of, systematically hunted out, chased and killed by valiant whaling captains, who <b>heaved</b> <b>up</b> their <b>anchors</b> with that express object as much in view, as in setting out through the Narragansett Woods, Captain Butler of old had it in his mind to capture that notorious murderous savage Annawon, the headmost warrior of the Indian King Philip.|$|R
60|$|At any rate, she did {{not look}} the part. And that was what he could not forgive. Had she been short-haired, heavy-jawed, large-muscled, hard- bitten, and utterly unlovely in every way, all would have been well. Instead of which she was hopelessly and deliciously feminine. Her hair worried him, it was so generously beautiful. And she was so slenderly and prettily the woman--the girl, rather--that it cut him like a knife to see her, with quick, {{comprehensive}} eyes and sharply imperative voice, superintend the launching of the whale-boat through the surf. In imagination he could see her roping a horse, and it always made him shudder. Then, too, she was so many-sided. Her knowledge of literature and art surprised him, while deep down was the feeling that a girl who knew such things had no right to know how to rig tackles, <b>heave</b> <b>up</b> <b>anchors,</b> and sail schooners around the South Seas. Such things in her brain were like so many oaths on her lips. While for such a girl to insist that she was going on a recruiting cruise around Malaita was positive self-sacrilege.|$|R
60|$|As for excitement, {{there is}} all the {{difference}} in the world between a ship in trouble at sea, and a small boat in trouble on land-locked water. Yet for genuine excitement and thrill, give me the small boat. Things happen so quickly, and there are always so few to do the work--and hard work, too, as the small-boat sailor knows. I have toiled all night, both watches on deck, in a typhoon off the coast of Japan, and been less exhausted than by two hours' work at reefing down a thirty-foot sloop and <b>heaving</b> <b>up</b> two <b>anchors</b> on a lee shore in a screaming southeaster.|$|R
6000|$|And yet, {{half an hour}} later, as {{they were}} dressing-down, the Bank fog dropped on them, [...] "between fish and fish," [...] as they say. It drove {{steadily}} and in wreaths, curling and smoking along the colourless water. The men stopped dressing-down without a word. Long Jack and Uncle Salters slipped the windlass-brakes into their sockets, and began to <b>heave</b> <b>up</b> the <b>anchor,</b> the windlass jarring as the wet hempen cable strained on the barrel. Manuel and Tom Platt gave a hand at the last. The <b>anchor</b> came <b>up</b> with a sob, and the riding-sail bellied as Troop steadied her at the wheel. [...] "Up jib and foresail," [...] said he.|$|R
60|$|How now! Here {{upon the}} very point of {{starting}} for the voyage, Captain Peleg and Captain Bildad were going {{it with a}} high hand on the quarter-deck, just {{as if they were}} to be joint-commanders at sea, as well as to all appearances in port. And, as for Captain Ahab, no sign of him was yet to be seen; Only, they said he was in the cabin. But then, the idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea. Indeed, as that was not at all his proper business, but the pilot's; and as he was not yet completely recovered--so they said--therefore, Captain Ahab stayed below. And all this seemed natural enough; especially as in the merchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable time after <b>heaving</b> <b>up</b> the <b>anchor,</b> but remain over the cabin table, having a farewell merry-making with their shore friends, before they quit the ship for good with the pilot.|$|R
60|$|This {{time the}} wind was also favourable, but, unfortunately, a little too strong; so we were obliged, in the evening, {{to come to an}} anchor in Esquimain River. This river has good {{anchorage}} close to the bank, but is very deep in the lead, or current; this, however, we did not know at the time, and seeing a small schooner close to shore, we rounded to a few fathoms outside of her, and let go our anchor. Whirr! went the chain--ten! twelve! sixteen! till at last forty fathoms ran out, and only a little bit remained on board, and still we had no bottom. After attaching our spare cable to the other one, the anchor at last grounded. This, however, was a dangerous situation to remain in, as, if the wind blew strong, we would have to run out to sea, and so much cable would {{take a long time to}} get in; so I ordered my two men, in a very pompous, despotic way, to <b>heave</b> <b>up</b> the <b>anchor</b> again. But not a bit would it budge. We all heaved at the windlass; still the obstinate anchor held fast. Again we gave another heave, and smashed both the handspikes.|$|R
60|$|The {{ship was}} found to ride easily by one cable, and the hands {{were sent to the}} {{windlass}} to <b>heave</b> <b>up</b> the other <b>anchor,</b> as our lead told us, we had rocks beneath us, and the captain was afraid of the chafing. The larboard-bower anchor was catted immediately, and there it was left suspended, with a range of cable overhauled, in readiness to let go at a moment's notice. After this, the people were told to get their suppers. As for us officers, we had other things to think of. The Crisis carried a small quarter-boat, and this was lowered into the water, the third-mate and myself manned its oars, and away we went to carry the captain round the ship, in order that he might ascertain the soundings, should it be necessary to get under way in the night. The examination was satisfactory, on all points but one; that of the holding-ground; and we returned to the vessel, having taken good care to trust ourselves in neither the wind nor the current. An anchor-watch was set, with a mate on deck, four hours and four hours, and all hands turned in.|$|R

6000|$|The {{following}} {{account of}} the continuation of her trial trip from Portland to Holyhead, as gathered from the Times, is exceedingly interesting:--When steam was up, and all ready for starting from Portland, the crew were sent forward to <b>heave</b> <b>up</b> the <b>anchor.</b> Eighty men sufficed to drag the Great Eastern up to and over her moorings. Bringing the anchor out of the ground, however, was not so easily managed; {{and it was not}} till all the musical resources known to sailors on such occasions were nearly exhausted that the tenacious gripe of Trotman's patent was released, when a slow drift with the tide showed that the great ship was again set free. In another minute, without shouting, confusion, or hurry of any kind, and with less noise than is made by a 100-ton coaster, a slight vibration through the ship, with a thin line of foam astern, showed that the screw engines were at work and the vessel once more under way. With such ease, with such perfect quietness and good order was everything accomplished, that the occasional cheering from the yachts and steamers was almost the first token given to those on board that the trial trip had commenced. At a quarter to four the [...] "way" [...] on the vessel was rapid; her head went round like turning a pleasure-boat; and so little sign was given of the ship being under steam, that it seemed rather as if the breakwater had got adrift and was slowly floating past, than that the monster vessel was really cleaving the blue waves with a force which, as yet, we have seen no wind or sea to resist or check. Directly the anchor was fished, Captain Harrison passed the word to steam ahead with both engines easily, and the wheels began their revolutions, slowly at first, but nevertheless making a track of foam upon the water such as they never made on the first start from Deptford to the Nore. The accession of speed from working the paddles was at first but slight; not from any want of power, however, but simply from the fact that both engines were ordered to work slowly, and though propelling the great ship at something like eleven knots, were really scarcely driving at indicated half-speed.|$|R

60|$|It is {{not nice}} {{to leave a}} warm bed {{and get out of}} a bad {{anchorage}} in a black blowy night, but we arose to the occasion, put in two reefs, and started to <b>heave</b> <b>up.</b> The winch was old, and the strain of the jumping head sea was too much for it. With the winch out of commission, it was impossible to <b>heave</b> <b>up</b> by hand. We knew, because we tried it and slaughtered our hands. Now a sailor hates to lose an anchor.
