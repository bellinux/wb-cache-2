Sometimes out of the cracked looking-glass his wistful, yearning face would plead to me; but I would sternly shake my head. I knew well his cunning.

She then removes from the box a [...]22 pistol and drops it into the flames of the heater, along with a familiar-looking hat and coat. She claims that she took it upon herself to start the Holiday killings, in an attempt to end the Roman’s hold on Gotham and thus lighten Dent's caseload so that they could have a child. Her belief is that <b>Dent</b> took <b>up</b> the killings on New Year’s Eve and that Alberto is lying to the police with his confession. She also says that she knows Dent will eventually be cured and that they will reconcile, because she believes in him.|$|R

In any case, the looks on their faces before they die seem to indicate they recognize who Holiday is. After Dent becomes Two-Face, both the ledger and a Holiday-style [...]22 are found in his briefcase in his basement. This leads Batman and Gordon to conclude that Dent was Holiday since the beginning.|$|R
40|$|In every time, {{the genetic}} basis of maize {{production}} {{is represented by}} the varieties and hybrids grown on the greatest area. It is interesting to note that, compared with the number of races and varieties available, there has always been {{only a small number of}} varieties that dominated the given maize production era. Chronologically, the Old Hungarian Yellow Flint group of varieties was popular from 1610 – 1914, American dent varieties (Iowa Goldmine, Queen of the Prairie, etc.) from 1900 – 1920, Bánkúti (Late) Dent from 1910 – 1935 and the varieties developed by Fleischmann from 1935 – 1960. Hybrid maize production was based on Mindszentpusztai Yellow <b>Dent</b> <b>up</b> till 1983 and on Iodent from 1983 onwards. Among the varieties previously popular for human consumption (porridge) in Eastern Central Europe, varieties related to Cinquantino and Pignoletto dominated variety use for a long period, and varieties in the Lapusnyaki group for a shorter time. The group of popular varieties, which were originally improved varieties, and others related to them, make up the “useful” part, or “heart core” of the genetic variability of maize in Eastern Central Europe. Due to the special methods employed for variety development and variety maintenance in this region, it is not difficult to identify variants of these previously popular varieties on the basis of morphological traits. These are of potential value. In many cases variety collections also include varieties developed by breeders or farmers, which differ genetically and morphologically from the popular varieties, but only increase the number of items in the collection. Experience shows that the adapted varieties that remained popular for a long period were used in maize breeding as sources of heterosis, while these latter were used as simple gene sources. The pure line method has been used widely and still holds the promise of success. As yet there does not appear to be any fundamentally new method that could replace it to make breeding more efficient. In each era, creative breeders developed competitive new varieties by exploiting the useful genetic variability available, so from the evolutionary point of view, new varieties should be regarded as foundation populations. Banning or restricting the re-utilisation of these populations could block the human regulation of evolution and limit increases in food production. The key question in maize breeding is always the active possession, practical preservation and systematic improvement of the type of biodiversity that is useful from the economic point of view in breeding...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of {{the strain}} {{distribution}} in a dent {{is crucial in}} assessing the severity of damage to pipes. Accordingly this paper {{presents the results of}} a series of tests to measure strains and displacements in previously dented aluminium pipes subject to increasing internal pressure. Indentation of unpressurized and pressurized pipes was caused by a rigid sphere and resulted in short smooth <b>dents</b> of depths <b>up</b> to 16 per cent of pipe diameter. Strain changes on the external pipe surface were monitored by strain gauges and a photoelastic coating. The results identify two stationary crescent-shaped regions of high external strain at the axial extremities of the initial dent, where strain concentration factors of 10 were recorded in the early (elastic) stages of pressurization, increasing to a maximum of 28 in one particular dent. The results have immediate application to the assessment of a gouge within a dent, which has long been recognized as the most severe form of mechanical damage to pipelines and can result in failures at very low internal pressures. A parallel series of burst tests by the authors revealed that gouges located near the axial extremities of the initial dent may cause premature failure. The strain concentration results presented here help to explain this behaviour, and indicate the size, shape and location of the regions of high external strain...|$|R

As the eagle {{attempts}} to eat the sandwich again, Jerry opens the eagle's mouth and kicks away the bread. The eagle then closes its mouth on Jerry, who proceeds to escape through eagle's nostril and kick him in the eye. The eagle grabs Jerry and a whistle is heard from Tom, who is wearing lipstick and a party horn on his face (accompanied by Scott Bradley's [...] "hot" [...] rendition of St. Louis Blues), beckoning the eagle from behind the house's chimney. In addition to the lipstick and party horn, Tom has taken a skirt and stuck feathers onto himself, giving himself the rather unconvincing appearance of a female bird. The eagle, unaware of Tom's disguise, becomes lovestruck and tries to kiss him. Jerry, not fooled by Tom's persona, uses the distraction to untie Tom’s dress, but Tom fastens it. The eagle tries to kiss Tom, again, and Jerry grabs the elastic band of the horn and it brings them together for a kiss. The eagle goes wild and he ends up dropping Jerry. Tom then puts Jerry down his dress. Jerry grabs a pin and sticks it in Tom's rear causing Tom to yowl and jump into the eagle's arms. Tom then runs away with the lovestruck eagle behind him. The eagle tries to kiss Tom but he ends <b>up</b> <b>denting</b> a stovepipe and pecking the bricks out of the chimney. Tom then gives a flirtatious smile and struts away.

Tom tries to hide and escape in various means, but the lovesick eagle somehow keeps finding him, and Tom keeps losing Jerry in the process.|$|R
40|$|The wheel {{rail contact}} {{operates}} in an arduous environment. Damage {{to the surface of}} either component is possible during manufacture, installation, or operation. The question arises as to how tolerant is the railway wheel or section of track to surface indentation or damage. In this work a twin disc simulation has been used to relate the level of surface damage (as well as the way it is generated) to the fatigue life of the surfaces. A related problem is the presence of solid contamination on the track. Sand (applied for improved adhesion) or track ballast material can cause damage to the rail and wheel surfaces. These mechanisms have been explored to assess the effect on contact fatigue life and wear. The disc specimens have been either artificially damaged (with dents and scratches) or run with particles of sand or ballast material. The discs were then loaded and rotated at realistic conditions of contact pressure and controlled slip. For normal operation of the contact, either dry or with water lubrication, surface dents and scratches have little effect on fatigue life. The normal plastic flow in the rail surface layer acts to close <b>up</b> <b>dents.</b> The failure of the disc is then by fatigue cracking across the whole surface with no particular preference to the dent location. Alternatively, if the contact is lubricated with oil then this plastic flow is greatly reduced and the dents act as stress raisers and fatigue cracks initiate from their trailing edge. Sand or ballast particles are crushed as they enter the wheel/rail contact. The fragments indent the surfaces and rapidly roughen the contact faces. The surface indentation is relatively minor, but the presence of particles increases the level of traction (over the wet case) and promotes further surface plastic flow. This can reduce the residual fatigue life of the contact. Further, high concentrations of sand were shown to promote a low cycle fatigue process that caused very high wear by the spallation of material. The twin disc simulations have shown that, under conditions similar to that of wheel/rail operation, surface damage is not a primary cause of fatigue failure. However, wear is greatly accelerated by the presence of solid contaminants and some evidence of a low cycle fatigue process was observed for sanded contacts...|$|R
