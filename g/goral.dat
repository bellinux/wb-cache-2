25|$|While {{folk music}} lost {{popularity}} in Poland, especially in urban areas, the tourist destination of Podhale has retained its traditions lively. The regional capital, Zakopane, {{has been a}} center for art since the late 19th century, when people like composer Karol Szymanowski, who discovered <b>Goral</b> folk music there, made the area chic among Europe's intellectuals. Though a part of Poland, Podhale's musical life is {{more closely related to}} that found in the Carpathian mountains of Ukraine, Slovakia, Moravia in Czech Republic and Transylvania.|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} {{had made}} its first flight by 5 March 1927, and underwent official evaluation against the designs from Bristol (the Beaver), Fairey (the Fairey Ferret and IIIF), Gloster (the <b>Goral)</b> and Westland (the Wapiti). Its initial tests showed it to possess good handling, and was taken forwards for squadron trials, along with the Ferret, IIIF and Wapiti. Following these trials, the Wapiti {{was chosen as the}} winner, with the Valiant, which was 30% more expensive than the Wapiti, rejected because it was a poor bombing platform, not being sufficiently stable.|$|E

50|$|<b>Gorals</b> are {{adherents of}} the Roman Catholic Church. The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Ludźmierz is of {{particular}} importance to the <b>Gorals,</b> being the oldest monument in the Podhale region. There are numerous cults connected to the church.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Gorals</b> {{and other}} West Slavic {{peoples of the}} Carpathians show little northern, Germanic, influence, as opposed to other regions of Poland. Carleton S. Coon grouped the <b>Gorals</b> with the Hutsuls in the southeastern corner of Poland (now Ukraine). In the 19th century, Polish {{scholars}} viewed the <b>Gorals</b> as linguistically close to the Poles, but having close ties with Slovak folk culture. It was noted that Gorals' social and economic life resembled that of Vlach shepherd culture.|$|R
25|$|The Vixen II {{prototype}} {{was modified}} {{to use the}} more powerful Rolls-Royce Condor engine {{at the end of}} 1924 as the Type 105 Vixen IV, which was intended for use as a night fighter. While it showed improved performance over the Lion-powered versions, it was not successful, and was modified with the enlarged wings of the Vixen III as a general-purpose aircraft (the Type 124 Vixen VI) for evaluation as a private venture entry to meet the requirements of Air Ministry Specification 26/27, competing against the Bristol Beaver, Fairey Ferret, de Havilland Hound, Gloster <b>Goral,</b> Westland Wapiti, and Vickers' own Valiant. The Vixen was rejected {{on the grounds that the}} Condor engine was too heavy and powerful for the role.|$|E
25|$|Prey {{animals in}} India include chital, sambar, muntjac, mouse deer, swamp deer, wild boar, gaur, water buffalo, banteng, cattle, nilgai, goats, Indian hares, Himalayan field rats and langurs. There is one {{record of a}} pack {{bringing}} down an Indian elephant calf in Assam, despite desperate defense of the mother resulting in numerous losses to the pack. In Kashmir, they prey on markhor, and thamin in Myanmar, Malayan tapir, Sumatran serow in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula, and Javan rusa in Java. In the Tien Shan and Tarbagatai Mountains, dholes prey on Siberian ibexes, arkhar, roe deer, maral and wild boar. In the Altai and Sayan Mountains, they prey on musk deer and reindeer. In eastern Siberia, they prey on roe deer, Manchurian wapiti, wild pig, musk deer, and reindeer, while in Primorye they feed on sika deer and <b>goral,</b> too. In Mongolia, they prey on argali and rarely Siberian ibex. Like African wild dogs, but unlike wolves, dholes are not known to attack people. Dholes eat fruit and vegetable matter more readily than other canids. In captivity, they eat various kinds of grasses, herbs and leaves, seemingly for pleasure rather than just when ill. In summertime in the Tien Shan Mountains, dholes eat large quantities of mountain rhubarb. Although opportunistic, dholes have a seeming aversion to hunting cattle and their calves. Livestock predation by dholes {{has been a problem}} in Bhutan since the late 1990s, as domestic animals are often left outside to graze in the forest, sometimes for weeks at a time. Livestock stall-fed at night and grazed near homes are never attacked. Oxen are killed more often than cows, probably because they are given less protection.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>Goral</b> was {{designed}} to allow the wings to be replaced with those from existing DH.9A stocks and the fuselage was constructed so that metal components could be replaced by wooden ones to optimise the possibility of overseas sales. [...] Nevertheless, these did not materialise, despite Argentinian interest as late as 1931.

5000|$|Historically, {{the issue}} of their ethnic {{identity}} has been controversial and resulted in claims and counterclaims by both Poland and Czechoslovakia. <b>Gorals,</b> like many other peasant communities in Central Europe, determined their own ethnic identities within the nation state system during the 19th and early 20th century. American anthropologists termed the <b>Gorals</b> [...] "Black Russians", while noting that the western <b>Gorals</b> spoke Polish. Although nationalist propaganda was generated by both Poles and Slovaks, this process of the Gorals' identification with a nationality was still not complete when the border was finalized in 1924. A notable example were Ferdynand Machay, a priest born in Jabłonka, Orava, Piotr Borowy from Rabča, Orava and Wojciech Halczyn from Lendak, Spiš, {{who went to the}} Paris Peace Conference, 1919 and, during a personal audience, lobbied U.S. president Woodrow Wilson to sign these lands over to Poland. After the world wars, some of the <b>Gorals</b> who had opted for a different national identity to the state they found themselves in emigrated to their chosen side of the border.
