40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Mapping of snow cover using ERTS- 1 data {{proved to be}} six times faster than that done from U- 2 photography. However, NOAA- 2 VHRR snow cover mapping was almost as fast as ERTS- 1, and it is available more frequently. Ice conditions in the Great Lakes can be readily determined by ERTS- 1. Ice features characteristic of thawing conditions such as rotten ice, lack of pressure ridges, brash belts, and compacted ice edges can be identified. A great decrease in apparent reflectivity in band 7 as compared to band 4 also indicated melting conditions. Using sidelap from two successive ERTS- 1 images of Lake Erie (February 17 and 18, 1973) a measure of ice movement was made, agreeing closely with the estimate from conventional methods. The same imagery permitted tentative identification of the following features: shuga, light and dark nilas, fast ice, <b>icefoot,</b> ice breccia, brash ice, fracturing, ridging, rafting, sastrugi, thaw holes, rotten ice, ice islands, dried ice puddles, hummocked ice, and leads...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 83 - 86) During winters 1987 - 88 and 1988 - 89, the Lake Michigan <b>icefoot</b> {{complex at}} Wilmette, Illinois, was monitored {{to determine its}} conditions of formation and destruction, and to determine {{the relative importance of}} those factors. Icefoot-complex formation is controlled primarily by air temperature, with all ice additions to the complex occurring in subfreezing conditions. Wave- heights above 0. 4 meters are a secondary facilitating factor, as is the presence of preexisting ice fragments offshore. Icefoot-complex destruction is primarily mechanical, caused by wave impacts. After breakup, ice fragments are transported from the area by longshore currents. Air temperature has only a gross correlation to ice destruction, probably due to the relatively slow speed at which ablation operates. Another secondary destructive process observed to occur is wind transport of ice fragments, which only occurs under limited circumstances. A sediment budget for the complex was prepared through sampling of the ice. The concentration of sediment in the complex is related to the type of incorporated ice. The total amount of sediment incorporated in the 1988 - 89 complex and transported by mechanical ice breakup was 2. 6 cubic meters/meter of shoreline. In comparison, at the same time, wave and wind transport accounted for 105. 4 and 1. 25 cubic meters/meter, respectively. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an investigation into the processes controlling development of a cryo-conditioned rock coast system in Hornsund, Svalbard. A suite of nested geomorphological and geophysical methods have been applied to characterise the functioning of rock cliffs and shore platforms influenced by lithological control and geomorphic processes driven by polar coast environments. Electrical resistivity tomosgraphy (ERT) surveys have been used to investigate permafrost control on rock coast dynamics and reveal the strong interaction with marine processes in High Arctic coastal settings. Schmidt hammer rock tests, demonstrated strong spatial control on the degree of rock weathering (rock strength) along High Arctic rock coasts. Elevation controlled geomorphic zones are identified and linked to distinct processes and mechanisms, transitioning from peak hardness values at the ice foot through the wave and storm dominated scour zones to the lowest values on the cliff tops, where the effects of periglacial weathering dominate. Observations of rock surface change using a traversing micro-erosion meter (TMEM) indicate that significant changes in erosion rates occur at the junction between the shore platform and the cliff toe, where rock erosion is facilitated by frequent wetting and drying and operation of nivation and sea ice processes (formation and melting of snow patches and <b>icefoot</b> complexes). The results are synthesised to propose a new conceptual model of High Arctic rock coast systems, with the aim of contributing towards a unifying concept of cold region landscape evolution and providing direction for future research regarding the state of polar rock coasts...|$|E
