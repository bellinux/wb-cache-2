5|$|<b>Ethically,</b> silver also symbolizes {{greed and}} {{degradation}} of consciousness; {{this is the}} negative aspect, the perverting of its value.|$|E
5|$|First thing, I {{saw these}} guys as scientifically {{accomplished}} but <b>ethically,</b> morons. They {{never had any}} reasons before to have ethical questions. So when they're hit with this device they're blindsided by it. The first thing they do is make money with it. They're {{not talking about the}} ethics of altering your former self.|$|E
5|$|Traditional diamond mining {{has led to}} human-rights {{abuses in}} Africa and elsewhere. The 2006 Hollywood movie Blood Diamond helped to {{publicize}} the situation. Consumer demand for synthetic diamonds is increasing, albeit from a small base, as customers look for stones which are <b>ethically</b> sound, and are cheaper.|$|E
5|$|After {{a lengthy}} legal process with two appeals that {{ultimately}} reached the Supreme Court in Nanjing and pitted public sentiment against {{the rule of}} law, she was finally given a state pardon by the Nationalist government on October 14, 1936. The assassination of Sun Chuanfang was <b>ethically</b> justified {{as an act of}} filial piety and turned into a political symbol of the legitimate vengeance against the Japanese invaders.|$|E
5|$|As medical {{professionals}} become better {{informed about the}} interdependent relationship between physical, emotional, social, and spiritual pain, and the demonstrated benefit to physical pain from alleviation of these other forms of suffering, they may be inclined to question the patient and family about interpersonal relationships. Unless the person has asked for such psychosocial intervention – or at least freely consented to such questioning – {{this would be an}} <b>ethically</b> unjustifiable intrusion into the patient's personal affairs (analogous to providing drugs without the patient's informed consent).|$|E
5|$|Gasketball was {{released}} for iPad on August 9, 2012. They {{had decided to}} release the game as an <b>ethically</b> non-coercive free-to-play game, with a free base game and in-app purchases for the extended content. Not as many players paid for the content as expected. This was due, in part, to the players' difficulty in finding the purchase function. The game had been downloaded 200,000 times in its August 2012 launch week and was briefly ranked {{near the top of}} an iTunes top downloads ranking, though it did not break the top 200 grossing chart.|$|E
5|$|Parents {{are assumed}} to have the child's best {{interests}} in mind. <b>Ethically,</b> {{it is imperative that}} the medical practitioner informs the parents about the benefits and risks of the procedure and obtain informed consent before performing it. Practically, however, many parents come to a decision about circumcising the child before he is born, and a discussion of the benefits and risks of the procedure with a physician has not been shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the decision. Some parents request to have their newborn or older child circumcised for non-therapeutic reasons, such as the parents' desires to adhere to family tradition, cultural norms or religious beliefs. In considering such a request, the physician may consider (in addition to any potential medical benefits and harms) such non-medical factors in determining the child's best interests and may <b>ethically</b> perform the procedure. Equally, without a clear medical benefit relative to the potential harms, a physician may take the ethical position that non-medical factors do not contribute enough as benefits to outweigh the potential harms and refuse to perform the procedure. Medical organization such as the British Medical Association state that their member physicians are not obliged to perform the procedure in such situations.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Chris Menaul and written by series creator Paul Attanasio. Wilford Brimley made a guest appearance as Harry Prentice, an ill and bed-ridden man who convinces his son to help him kill himself. Attanasio deliberately wrote the script {{so it would be}} morally questionable whether police handling of both the suicide and the police shooting were done in an <b>ethically</b> correct way. Pembleton's investigation was based on a real-life investigation into a suspicious shooting featured in David Simon's non-fiction book , on which the Homicide series was based.|$|E
5|$|The {{standardized}} {{procedures for}} testimony by forensic chemists {{are provided by}} the various agencies that employ the scientists as well as SWGDRUG. Forensic chemists are <b>ethically</b> bound to present testimony in a neutral manner and {{to be open to}} reconsidering their statements if new information is found. Chemists should also limit their testimony to areas they have been qualified in regardless of questions during direct or cross-examination.|$|E
5|$|A patient's genome {{may include}} an {{inherited}} or random mutation which affects {{the probability of}} developing a disease in the future. For example, Lynch syndrome is a genetic disease that predisposes patients to colorectal and other cancers; early detection can lead to close monitoring that improves the patient's chances of a good outcome. Cardiovascular risk is indicated by biological markers and screening can measure the risk that a child will be born with a genetic disease such as Cystic fibrosis. Genetic testing is <b>ethically</b> complex: patients may not want the stress of knowing their risk. In countries without universal healthcare, a known risk may raise insurance premiums.|$|E
5|$|Gasketball was {{released}} for iPad on August 9, 2012. They {{had decided to}} release the game as what they deemed to be an <b>ethically</b> non-coercive free-to-play game, with a free base game and in-app purchases for the extended content.

5|$|Raised in Evergreen Park, Illinois, Kaczynski {{was a child}} prodigy {{and entered}} Harvard College {{at the age of}} 16. He earned his bachelor's degree from Harvard in 1962, then his master's and {{doctorate}} in mathematics from the University of Michigan in 1964 and 1967, respectively. After receiving his doctorate at age 25, he became an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley, but resigned abruptly two years later. As an undergraduate at Harvard, Kaczynski was a research subject in an <b>ethically</b> questionable experiment conducted by psychology professor Henry Murray, which some analysts have claimed influenced Kaczynski's later actions.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{known for}} his smoking character, Davis quit smoking in the 1970s; when The X-Files started up, {{he was given a}} choice between herbal {{cigarettes}} and tobacco cigarettes. At first, he chose to use tobacco cigarettes, but switched to herbal because he was afraid of becoming addicted to them again. Davis used his notoriety on the show to assist the Canadian Cancer Society in its programs to combat smoking. In 2014, Davis donated his investments that support fossil fuels to the David Suzuki Foundation in an effort to both <b>ethically</b> invest, and help fund work to fight climate change. Davis is a passionate advocate for action in response to climate change, believes it is a critical issue of our time and speaks on the subject often. Taking action on a personal level, Davis drives a Tesla powered by hydroelectricity.|$|E
5|$|The year 1823 saw the {{founding}} of the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery (later the Anti-Slavery Society), and the publication of Wilberforce's 56-page Appeal to the Religion, Justice and Humanity of the Inhabitants of the British Empire in Behalf of the Negro Slaves in the West Indies. In his treatise, Wilberforce urged that total emancipation was morally and <b>ethically</b> required, and that slavery was a national crime that must be ended by parliamentary legislation to gradually abolish slavery. Members of Parliament did not quickly agree, and government opposition in March 1823 stymied Wilberforce's call for abolition. On 15 May 1823, Buxton moved another resolution in Parliament for gradual emancipation. Subsequent debates followed on 16 March and 11 June 1824 in which Wilberforce made his last speeches in the Commons, and which again saw the emancipationists outmanoeuvred by the government.|$|E
25|$|It is {{also often}} <b>ethically</b> {{challenging}} in practice to use placebos {{as a form}} of treatment.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, Asda's Valentine's Day roses, sold at £2 for a dozen, {{were said}} to be <b>ethically</b> sourced by the supermarket. This claim went against {{research}} carried out by War on Want.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to regulating {{the funding of}} VRS, the FCC regulates the standards that VRS companies and their employees must follow in handling calls. These regulations ensure that VRS calls are handled appropriately and <b>ethically.</b>|$|E
25|$|Deontological {{issues are}} issues {{about whether a}} person has an ethical duty or {{responsibility}} to take an action. Nearly all scholars and societies around the world agree that voluntarily donating organs to sick people is <b>ethically</b> permissible. Although nearly all scholars encourage organ donation, fewer scholars believe that all people are <b>ethically</b> required to donate their organs after death. Similarly, nearly all religions support voluntary organ donation as a charitable act of great benefit to the community, although a few small groups, like the Roma (gypsies), oppose organ donation on religious grounds. Issues surrounding patient autonomy, living wills, and guardianship make it nearly impossible for involuntary organ donation to occur.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{distinguishing}} between lies {{according to their}} external severity, Augustine maintains in both treatises that all lies, defined precisely as the external communication of what one does not hold to be internally true, are categorically sinful and therefore <b>ethically</b> impermissible.|$|E
25|$|A second {{explanation}} {{issued by}} Janssen and Vanhamme {{is that of}} reciprocal altruism. This is a key concept in evolutionary psychology that is argued to fuel all human behaviour: people only do something {{if they can get}} something back in return. In the case of CSR and ethical consumerism, however, consumers get very little in return for their investment. <b>Ethically</b> sourced or manufactured products are typically higher in price due to greater costs. However, the reward for consumers is not much different from that of a non-ethical counterpart. Therefore, evolutionary speaking making an ethical purchase is not worth the higher cost to the individual even if they believe in supporting <b>ethically,</b> environmentally and socially beneficial causes.|$|E
25|$|Local {{civilian}} support {{would likely}} be welcomed {{but there are no}} guidelines or a codex for these kinds of situation or interactions and sissis are trained to be invisible to the local population which also helps avoid legally and <b>ethically</b> difficult situations.|$|E
25|$|In {{academic}} fields, self-plagiarism {{occurs when}} an author reuses {{portions of their}} own published and copyrighted work in subsequent publications, but without attributing the previous publication. Identifying self-plagiarism is often difficult because limited reuse of material is accepted both legally (as fair use) and <b>ethically.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2000, the Koolie Club of Australia {{was formed}} to preserve, protect and <b>ethically</b> promote the Koolie breed. The Koolie Club does not {{actively}} work towards bench standard recognition, feeling this would only be detrimental to the breeds working future. As of (2013), no bench standard exists.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{interpretations of}} some moral {{decisions}} in the Bible are considered <b>ethically</b> questionable by many modern groups. Some of the passages most commonly criticized include colonialism, the subjugation of women, religious intolerance, condemnation of homosexuality, {{and support for the}} institution of slavery in both Old and New Testaments.|$|E
25|$|Grover Boydston {{conducted}} the first demographic study of Neurotics Anonymous in 1974. Such studies are rare and samples sizes are usually small as any group following the Twelve Traditions {{is required to}} protect the anonymity of their members. While researching such groups is still <b>ethically</b> possible, {{it is more difficult}} given this constraint.|$|E
25|$|Ethical marketing: Companies that <b>ethically</b> {{market to}} {{consumers}} are placing a higher value on their customers and respecting them {{as people who}} are ends in themselves. They {{do not try to}} manipulate or falsely advertise to potential consumers. This is important for companies that want to be viewed as ethical.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has proven}} that {{non-human}} animals {{can and do}} have sex for non-reproductive purposes (and for pleasure). In 2006, a Danish Animal Ethics Council report concluded that <b>ethically</b> performed zoosexual activity is capable of providing a positive experience for all participants, and that some non-human animals are sexually attracted to humans (for example, dolphins).|$|E
25|$|Thousands {{of youth}} and volunteers {{participate}} in four programs, Cub Scouting, Boy Scouts, Venturing and Sea Scouting, with the mission of preparing youth to make correct choices <b>ethically</b> and morally for their future by learning the Scout Law and Scout Promise. The council serves more than 6,200 youth and 3,500 volunteers in more than 300 units.|$|E
25|$|NARTH {{stated in}} 2012 that refusing to offer therapy aimed at {{change to a}} client who {{requests}} it, and telling them that their only option is to claim a gay identity, could also be considered <b>ethically</b> unacceptable. In 2012 the British Psychological Society issued a position statement opposing any treatments {{that are based on}} an assumption that non-heterosexual orientations are pathological.|$|E
25|$|While {{industrial}} partnerships {{stand to}} amplify mutual interests and accelerate success, {{some forms of}} collaboration may be considered <b>ethically</b> problematic. When a politician, for example, partners with a corporation to advance the latter's interest in exchange for some benefit, {{a conflict of interest}} results; consequentially, the public good may suffer. While technically lawful in some jurisdictions, such practice is broadly viewed negatively or as corruption.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, Paul Wolfowitz was {{alleged to}} have {{involved}} himself in Riza's career by personally increasing her pay. This was a potential impropriety. Instead, Riza was asked to leave the World Bank altogether. She even forwent a promotion for which she was highly recommended. By 2007 the Board of the World Bank accepted that Paul Wolfowitz acted <b>ethically.</b> Still by June of that year Wolfowitz resigned.|$|E
25|$|Philip Booth {{says that}} the selling {{techniques}} used by some sellers and some supporters of Fairtrade are bullying, misleading, and unethical. There are problems {{with the use of}} boycott campaigns and other pressure to force sellers to stock a product they think <b>ethically</b> suspect. However, the opposite has been argued, that a more participatory and multi-stakeholder approach to auditing might improve the quality of the process.|$|E
