50|$|SPY-1B is {{the model}} adopts VLSI {{resulting}} in increased performance and reduced size and weight. For example, the electronic cabinets area reduced from 11 to 5, with corresponding weight reduced from 14700 lb to 10800 lb, and separate digital modules are reduced from 3806 to 1606. 7-bit phase shifter replaced the 4-bit phase shifter in earlier models, with corresponding weight of phase shifters in face of the antenna reduced from 12000 lb to 7900 lb, and a reduction of side lobe by 15 dB. There are 4350 radiators with two side lobe cancellation antenna, each with two elements, and the radar uses eleven 16-bit microprocessors. Ability to counter steep <b>diving</b> <b>missiles</b> are improved with more energy at higher elevation or longer pulse.|$|R

50|$|Sea Zenith is a four-barrelled 25 mm CIWS {{used by the}} Turkish Navy {{on their}} MEKO 200 frigates, like the Barbaros and Yavuz classes. It was {{developed}} in the 1980s by Oerlikon Contraves (Rheinmetall Air Defence since 2009) around their Oerlikon KBB gun and manufactured in Switzerland. This automatic gun uses a 25x184mm cartridge (longer than the one used by the more common Oerlikon KBA gun) at a rate of 800 rounds a minute. Using four independent guns instead of one multi-barrelled Gatling gun improves reliability. The system is mounted in an enclosed automatic turret and directed by the Seaguard radar developed by Contraves. The turret is tilted back to allow a higher elevation to intercept <b>diving</b> <b>missiles.</b> The system's primary purpose is defence against anti-ship missiles, and other precision guided weapons. However it can also be employed against fixed/rotary wing aircraft, ships and other small craft, coastal targets, and floating mines.|$|R
5000|$|Saab's Sea GIRAFFE AMB is {{the naval}} variant of their Giraffe radar with 3D AMB technology. It can detect air and surface targets from the horizon up to {{a height of}} 20,000 m at {{elevations}} up to 70°, and can simultaneously handle multiple threats approaching from different directions and altitudes, including <b>diving</b> anti-ship <b>missiles.</b> Also, it is specialized for rapidly detecting small, fast moving targets at all altitudes and small surface targets in severe clutter. Sea Giraffe AMB is installed on the Republic of Singapore Navy's upgraded Victory-class corvette and US Navy's [...] of Littoral Combat Ships, and has the designation AN/SPS 77 V(1) for LCS 2 and 4, and AN/SPS 77 V(2) for LCS 6 and higher. The radar has an instrumented range of 180 kilometres.Its roles include: ...|$|R
50|$|The Phoenix {{has several}} {{guidance}} modes and achieves its longest range by using mid-course updates from the F-14A/B AWG-9 radar (APG-71 radar in the F-14D) as it climbs to cruise between 80000 ft and 100000 ft {{at close to}} Mach 5. Phoenix uses this high altitude to gain gravitational potential energy, which is later converted into kinetic energy as the <b>missile</b> <b>dives</b> at high velocity towards its target. At around 11 mi from the target, the missile activates its own radar to provide terminal guidance. Minimum engagement range for the Phoenix is around 2 nmi km and active homing would initiate upon launch.|$|R
5000|$|When {{entering}} the terminal phase of flight, the missile switches on its terminal guidance radar {{to search for}} the target. Once within a few kilometers of the target, the missile drops to 3-5 meters above sea level, about the same as a French Exocet missile. This altitude is slightly lower than the original 5-7 metres of the C-801/YJ-81. The missile may also maneuver during the terminal phase to make it a more difficult target for shipborne air defense systems. When approaching the target, the <b>missile</b> <b>dives</b> to hit the waterline of the ship to inflict maximum damage. At the 6th Zhuhai Airshow held at the end of 2006, the manufacturer revealed that the [...] "pop-up" [...] approach and the checkpoint flight functions are being worked on.|$|R

Entered service at: Los Angeles, Calif Birth: Los Angeles, Calif. G.O. No.. 24, 7 March 1946. [...] "He {{fought with}} great gallantry and intrepidity near Seravezza, Italy. When his unit was pinned down by grazing {{fire from the}} enemy's strong {{mountain}} defense and command of the squad devolved on him with the wounding of its regular leader, he made frontal, one-man attacks through direct fire and knocked out two machine guns with grenades. Withdrawing under murderous fire and showers of grenades from other enemy emplacements, he had nearly reached a shell crater occupied by two of his men when an unexploded grenade bounced on his helmet and rolled toward his helpless comrades. He arose into the withering fire, <b>dived</b> for the <b>missile</b> and smothered its blast with his body. By his swift, supremely heroic action Pfc. Munemori saved two of his men {{at the cost of}} his own life and did much to clear the path for his company's victorious advance." ...|$|R

Filling a gap in the front lines during a critical phase of the battle, Private First Class LaBelle had dug into a foxhole with two other Marines and grimly aware of the enemy's persistent attempts to blast a way through our lines with hand grenades, applied himself with steady concentration to maintaining a sharply vigilant watch during the hazardous night hours. Suddenly a hostile grenade landed beyond reach in his foxhole.

Stouthearted and indomitable, he had unhesitatingly relinquished his own chance of survival that his fellow Marines might carry on the relentless fight against a fanatic enemy and, his dauntless courage, cool decision and valiant spirit of self-sacrifice in the face of certain death reflect the highest credit upon Private First Class LaBelle and the United States Naval Service.

50|$|The C-101 (FL-2) is a {{supersonic}} {{anti-ship missile}} {{that can be}} launched from air, ship, and shore. Alternatively, the air-launched version is also called YJ-1 by Chinese, with YJ short for Ying Ji (鹰击), meaning Eagle Strike. The missile is also known designated by Chinese as Fei Long - 2 for export (with Fei Long meaning Flying Dragon - 2, or FL-2 for short), {{and there are two}} side-mounted ramjet engines {{at the rear of the}} airframe. The ship-launched version C-101 and the air-launched version YJ-1 both have integrated fire control system to meet the tight space requirement on board ships and aircraft, where the coastal defense version FL-2 has a distributed fire control system, where power, radar, and operator consoles are located separately to reduce the possible damage from enemy attacks. This is a practice commonly adopted by other Chinese missiles such as Silkworm missiles. The NATO reporting name for this missile is CSSC-5 Saple. The development of C-101 missile started in the late 1970s, and production began in the mid-1990s, as part of the replacement of the obsolete HY-2/CSS-N-2 missiles. The Chinese Navy tested the C-101 anti-ship missile on the Hoku-class missile boat, and Huang-class missile boat are being fitted with four C-101 launch tubes, while smaller classes carry two launch tubes. The air-launched version has been reportedly carried on the H-5 and Xi’an H-6 bombers and the Harbin SH-5 amphibian and eventually expanded to most of the aircraft in the Chinese inventory.
