A large focus of the season is Dean's quest to overcome the Mark of Cain and have it removed if possible. After the Mark causes him to break Charlie's arm, Sam suggests that Dean {{has the ability to}} at least partially control the Mark, but only if he can control himself. New hope for ridding Dean of the Mark comes when Charlie unearths the Book of the Damned. Sam needs help in reading and using this powerful tome, and turns to Rowena for help, keeping the entire thing a secret from Dean. He requests help from Charlie, too, who decodes the text but is murdered by the Steins, a <b>family</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> secretly controlled much of history. After massacring the Steins, nearly killing Castiel and getting another hunter killed, Dean starts despairing of being free of the Mark, causing him to turn to Death for help. Death proposes putting Dean in isolation away the Earth, but insists Dean must kill Sam, who otherwise would work to bring Dean back. Sam and Dean both agree that it is {{for the good of the}} world. At the last moment however, Dean seemingly kills Death instead to save Sam. Oblivious to the dangers, Rowena successfully casts the spell to remove the Mark and unleashes the Darkness, a primordial evil that had been kept away by the Mark. Rowena also places Castiel under a spell so he attacks Crowley as she escapes with the Book of the Damned.|$|E

500|$|Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca {{has been}} {{confused}} with the true chanterelles (genus Cantharellus) because of overall similarities in appearance. A combination of characters—including forked gills, frequently off-centre stipe placement, and dextrinoid spores—suggested to others a relationship with Paxillus. These characteristics prompted Singer to classify the genus Hygrophoropsis in the Paxillaceae in 1946, although others placed it in the Tricholomataceae, a <b>family</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> {{been described as a}} wastebasket taxon. Singer initially included only two species, both with dextrinoid spores—H.aurantiaca and H.tapinia. He justified the placement of Hygrophoropsis in the Paxillaceae largely on fruit body morphology and spore size: [...] "The discovery of a second species, H.tapinia, with smaller spores and an external appearance frankly suggesting Paxillus curtisii but never met with in Clitocybe, makes the affinity between Hygrophoropsis and Paxillus an established fact." [...] In 1975, he added H.olida, a species with inamyloid but [...] spores, whose characteristics otherwise aligned with the type species.|$|E
500|$|The basionym {{for this}} species is Simblum periphragmoides, first {{described}} by German mycologist Johann Friedrich Klotzsch in 1831, based on specimens collected in Bois Chéry in Mauritius. Klotzsch designated {{it as the}} type species of Simblum, a genus differentiated from the similar genus Lysurus by having the fruit body ending in a spherical, chambered head, with gleba developing within the depressions of the chambers. Lysurus periphragmoides is a morphologically variable species; as a result, it has acquired an extensive number of synonyms, as various authors have decided that the different forms warranted being designated as new species. Donald Malcolm Dring's 1980 monograph on the Clathraceae (a <b>family</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> since been [...] into the Phallaceae) transferred the taxon to Lysurus, explaining [...] "a distinction between [...] "Simblum" [...] and Lysurus in the original restricted sense cannot be easily maintained because there are examples of intermediates states", and he lumped 18 synonyms under L.periphragmoides.|$|E

The strings are tuned to G2, D3, A3, and E4, an octave below the violin, and the instrument may be performed similar to a violoncello. ‘Cello players would need to adapt their technique to accommodate the shorter string and body length, and use of the thumb position would not be the same. The design specifications are well suited to industrial manufacture, retaining consistency in quality. This is not the case with traditional instruments since the choice of fine materials and the skills of the luthier are essential in producing instruments with superior sound qualities.|$|E
