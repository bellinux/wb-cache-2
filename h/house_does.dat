5|$|At {{the same}} time, House is annoyed {{because he is}} not able to spend enough time with his friend, James Wilson. He {{attempts}} to negotiate with Amber, Wilson's girlfriend, about conditions under which they can both have Wilson's company. They are at a standstill, thus House seeks Lisa Cuddy's (Lisa Edelstein) resolution. However, she will only lay out the conditions if <b>House</b> <b>does</b> his team's performance reviews (knowing that he hates doing paperwork). House relents and Cuddy sets the rules, although House has Foreman do the team reviews instead.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} family arrive at their new house in Cypress Creek, they meet Homer's new boss, Hank Scorpio, {{who is very}} amiable and seems like the perfect boss. After giving Homer {{a tour of the}} company, Scorpio tells him that his job is to motivate the {{employees}} in the nuclear division. Meanwhile, Bart starts school, but he finds that his new class is far above the standards of Springfield Elementary. When his teacher discovers that Bart cannot read cursive writing, he places him in a remedial class, much to Bart's shock. Lisa goes for a nature walk and discovers that she is allergic to all of the plants around Cypress Creek. Marge tries to go about her daily chores, but the <b>house</b> <b>does</b> everything automatically. This ends up depressing her to the point where Marge starts drinking wine to cope. However, Homer does an excellent job motivating his team in the nuclear division, which makes his family very proud of him.|$|E

50|$|Angela's death infuriates Camilo, the pilot, {{who knows}} that Machiche is {{directly}} responsible for Angelas's suicide. Camilo takes the monk's revolver and kills Machiche. Despairing, Cristobal jumps behind Camilo and strangles him with a shovel. Now there are three dead bodies. Angry, Don Graci gives orders to bury Camilo and Machiche and cremate Angela's body in the oven. The next day {{the survivors of the}} house abandon it. Don Graci gives Cristobal his freedom. The four men leave the property. Sometime later, Angela's boyfriend arrives to the abandoned house calling out her name. He reads the four rules at the entrance of the mansion of Araucaima: If you enter this <b>house,</b> <b>do</b> not leave. If you leave this <b>house,</b> <b>do</b> not go back. If you pass by this <b>house,</b> <b>do</b> not look. If you dwell in this <b>house,</b> <b>do</b> not plant prayers.|$|R

25|$|In May 1964, {{the house}} was {{included}} in the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) as catalog number CA-1911. This is the only official historical building listing of the house.

25|$|A {{gingerbread}} <b>house</b> <b>does</b> {{not have}} to be an actual house, although it is the most common. It can be anything from a castle to a small cabin, or another kind of building, such as a church, an art museum, or a sports stadium, and other items, such as cars, gingerbread men and gingerbread women, can be made of gingerbread dough.|$|E
25|$|Freedom <b>House</b> <b>does</b> not {{maintain}} a culture-bound view of freedom. The methodology {{of the survey}} is grounded in basic standards of political rights and civil liberties, derived in large measure from relevant portions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. These standards apply to all countries and territories, irrespective of geographical location, ethnic or religious composition, or level of economic development.|$|E

25|$|Stress {{patterns}} may distinguish {{a compound}} word from a noun phrase {{consisting of the}} same component words. For example, a black board, adjective plus noun, is any board that is black, and has equal stress on both elements. The compound blackboard, on the other hand, though it may have started out historically as black board, now is stressed on only the first element, black. Thus a compound such as the White House normally has a falling intonation which a phrase such as a white <b>house</b> <b>does</b> not.|$|E
25|$|The Head of House is {{responsible}} for doing the shopping list and deciding who does what in the shopping task. The Head of House is immune from being nominated for the week they hold the title, but they can still nominate others. The Head of <b>House</b> <b>does</b> not participate {{in any of the}} weekly shopping tasks, but supervises instead. Once a housemate has been Head of House they could not stand a second time, but could compete to stay in heaven. After the divide was removed, only eligible housemates competed to become Head of House, except for Week 12 when all housemates were eligible. On Day 88 all previous Heads of House joined Mohamed Mohamed in becoming Head of House for one day, putting an end to the role of Head of House.|$|E

2500|$|The {{main house}} was built in 1903. [...] It sits on a gentle slope facing Mule Creek. [...] The house is a two-story, wood–frame structure. [...] The lumber for the house was all cut by hand from Ponderosa pine logs cut on the site. [...] The siding was {{smoothed}} with hand planes down to one quarter inch in thickness. [...] The window glass was shipped overland from Portland, but the window frames were handmade at the ranch. [...] The main <b>house</b> <b>does</b> not have a fireplace. [...] It is heated by a wood-burning stove in the living room.|$|E

These are reporting a measure to the full House with or without amendments, report the measure to the full House with a negative recommendation or fail to report the measure. The House may under certain rules remove the bill or measure from committee (known as [...] "discharging the bill from committee") if {{the committee}} fails to report the measure to the House Rules Committee or to the full House and a negative report to the full <b>House</b> <b>does</b> not terminate the bill. The phrase that a [...] "bill has been killed in committee" [...] is not completely accurate as the full House always has options under the rules to remove the bill from Committee and to take action.|$|E

2500|$|In {{support of}} the scheme, NMP Paulin Tay Straughan said in Parliament on 26 April 2010 that it neither compromises the {{democratic}} process nor perpetuates {{the dominance of the}} ruling party, because during elections Singaporeans vote for the political parties that best represent their interests and ideals, and the presence of NMPs in the <b>House</b> <b>does</b> not factor into this choice. In her view, NMPs add value to the discourse taking place in Parliament as they are able to [...] "explore and research the issues from all possible socially significant angles" [...] without constraint from [...] "partisan concerns". She felt personally that she was accountable to all Singaporeans, rather than being unaccountable to anybody. In addition, Ho Khai Leong has opined that the presence of NMPs and their participation in Parliamentary debates have placed pressure on PAP MPs to be less complacent and to be more competent in Parliament.|$|E
