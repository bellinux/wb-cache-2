25|$|This {{instrument}} {{contains a}} suite of sensors that measured the physical and electrical properties of Titan's atmosphere. Accelerometers measured forces in all three axes as the probe descended through the atmosphere. With the aerodynamic properties of the probe already known, {{it was possible to}} determine the density of Titan's atmosphere and to detect wind gusts. The probe was designed so that {{in the event of a}} landing on a liquid surface, its motion due to waves would also have been measurable. Temperature and pressure sensors measured the thermal properties of the atmosphere. The Permittivity and Electromagnetic Wave Analyzer component measured the electron and ion (i.e., positively charged particle) conductivities of the atmosphere and searched for electromagnetic wave activity. On the surface of Titan, the electrical conductivity and permittivity (i.e., the ratio of <b>electric</b> <b>displacement</b> field to its electric field) of the surface material was measured. The HASI subsystem also contains a microphone, which was used to record any acoustic events during probe's descent and landing; this was the first time in history that audible sounds from another planetary body had been recorded.|$|E

2500|$|Just {{considering}} electromagnetic waves, we {{note that}} the preceding discussion strictly applies to plane waves in a homogeneous isotropic non-attenuating medium, whereas in an anisotropic medium (such as birefringent crystals as discussed below) the electric or magnetic field may have longitudinal as well as transverse components. In those cases the <b>electric</b> <b>displacement</b> D and magnetic flux density B still obey the above geometry but due to anisotropy in the electric susceptibility (or in the magnetic permeability), now given by a tensor, the direction of E (or H) may differ from that of D (or B).

40|$|Abstract. This study {{deals with}} the {{computation}} of the intensity factors for cracks in two-dimensional piezoelectric solids under static electromechanical loading. A direct collocation boundary element code with subdomain technique is developed, whereby the fundamental solutions are computed by a fast numerical algorithm applying Fourier series. Linear boundary conditions can be prescribed in a very general form in different coordinate systems. The discretization of the boundary contours is performed by parabolic isoparametric elements. Directly at the crack tips quarter-point elements are used to model the typical behavior of the near tip solution, especially the 1 / r-singularity of stresses and <b>electric</b> <b>displacements,</b> with high accuracy.

40|$|AbstractBased on the {{fundamental}} equations of piezoelasticity of quasicrystal media, using the symmetry operations of point groups, the linear piezoelasticity behavior of one-dimensional (1 D) hexagonal quasicrystals is investigated and the piezoelasticity problem of 1 D hexagonal quasicrystals is decomposed into two uncoupled problems, i. e., the classical plane elasticity problem of conventional hexagonal crystals and the phonon–phason-electric coupling elasticity problem of 1 D hexagonal quasicrystals. The final governing equations are derived for the phonon–phason-electric coupling anti-plane elasticity of 1 D hexagonal quasicrystals.

Once the initial, steady-state and far-field conditions are known, the solution to the first order differential equation can be obtained. From the solved function, explicit expressions are then derived for the stresses, strains, electric fields and <b>electric</b> <b>displacements</b> induced by the piezoelectric screw dislocation. Also presented is the image force acting on the screw dislocation due to its interaction with the Kelvin-type viscoelastic interface.

40|$|ABSTRACT- Propagation of SH {{waves in}} a {{circular}} cylindrical layered piezoelectric structure with initial stress is investigated analytically. the governing equations of the coupled waves are reduced to Bessel equation and Laplace equation. The boundary conditions are assumed that the <b>displacements,</b> shear stress, <b>electric</b> potential, and <b>electric</b> <b>displacements</b> are continuous across the interface between the layer and the substrate together with the traction free at {{the surface of the}} layer. The electrically open and short conditions at cylindrical surface are adopted to solve the problem. The phase velocity is numerically calculated for the electric open and short cases, respectively, for different thickness of the layer and wavenumber. The effect of the initial stress on the phase velocity and the electromechanical coupling factor are discussed in detail for piezoelectric ceramics PZT- 5 H.
