40|$|The main aim of {{this project}} is to design an {{embedded}} system for implementing a efficient alcohol detection system that will be useful to avoid accidents. There are {{many different types of}} accidents which occur in daily life. Accidents may cause due to many reasons it may be due to brake fail. Most often accidents occur due to over drunken person. Though there are laws to punish drunken drivers they cannot be fully implemented. Because traffic police cannot stand on every road to check each and every car driver whether he/she has drunk or not. This can be a major reason for accidents. So {{there is a need for}} a effective system to check drunken drivers. Therefore in order to avoid these accidents we have implemented a prototype project. In our project, <b>Initially</b> <b>we</b> <b>check</b> whether the person has drunken or not by using the MQ 3 GAS sensor. In this system, sensor circuit is used to detect whether the alcohol was consumed by driver or not. To this end, we have designed such a system that when alcohol concentration is detected then car will be stopped and the related information will go to nearby location through GSM. This project is based on EMBEDDED C programming using AVR-AT mega 16 microcontroller...|$|R

This interpretation allows us to conjecture the IR limits of flows in the unitary minimal models generated by the fields ϕ_rr of `low' weight. <b>We</b> <b>check</b> this conjecture using the truncated conformal space approach. In the process we find evidence for {{a new series of}} integrable boundary flows. Comment: (latex 2 e, 27 pages, 17 figures...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} local {{variation}} of the geomagnetic field measured by the Huancayo Geomagnetic Observatory, Peru, during 2001 - 2010. <b>Initially,</b> <b>we</b> sought to relate the SFI values, stored daily in the NOAA's National Geophysical Data Center, with the corresponding geomagnetic index; however, no relation was observed. Nonetheless, subsequently, a comparison between the monthly geomagnetic-activity index and the monthly SFI average allowed observing a temporal correlation between these average indices. This correlation shows {{that the effect of}} the solar flares does not simultaneously appear on the corresponding magnetic indices. To investigate this, we selected the most intense X-class flares; then, <b>we</b> <b>checked</b> the magnetic field disturbances observed in the Huancayo Geomagnetic Observatory magnetograms. We found some disturbances of the local geomagnetic field {{in the second and third}} day after the corresponding solar flare; however, the disturbance strength of the local geomagnetic field is not correlated with the X-class of the solar flare. Finally, there are some disturbances of the local geomagnetic field that are simultaneous with the X-class solar flares and they show a correlation with the total flux of the solar flare...|$|R
