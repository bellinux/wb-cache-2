40|$|INTRODUCTION: Metastases {{remain the}} primary cause of cancer-related death. The {{acquisition}} of <b>invasive</b> <b>tumour</b> <b>cell</b> behaviour is thought to be a cornerstone of the metastatic cascade. Therefore, gene signatures related to invasiveness could aid in stratifying patients according to their prognostic profile. In the present study we aimed at identifying an invasiveness gene signature and investigated its biological relevance in breast cancer. METHODS & RESULTS: We collected a set of published gene signatures related to cell motility and invasion. Using this collection, we identified 16 genes that were represented at a higher frequency than observed by coincidence, hereafter named the core invasiveness gene signature. Principal component analysis showed that these overrepresented genes were able to segregate invasive and non-invasive breast cancer cell lines, outperforming sets of 16 randomly selected genes (all P< 0. 001). When applied onto additional data sets, the expression of the core invasiveness gene signature was significantly elevated in cell lines forced to undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The link between core invasiveness gene expression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition was also confirmed in a dataset consisting of 2420 human breast cancer samples. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that CIG expression is not associated with a shorter distant metastasis free survival interval (HR = 0. 956, 95 %C. I.  = 0. 896 - 1. 019, P = 0. 186). DISCUSSION: These data demonstrate that we have identified a set of core invasiveness genes, the expression of which is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cell lines and in human tissue samples. Despite the connection between epithelial-mesenchymal transition and <b>invasive</b> <b>tumour</b> <b>cell</b> behaviour, we were unable to demonstrate a link between the core invasiveness gene signature and enhanced metastatic potential...|$|E
50|$|Cell {{migration}} {{is a central}} process {{in the development and}} maintenance of multicellular organisms. Tissue formation during embryonic development, wound healing and immune responses all require the orchestrated movement of cells in particular directions to specific locations. Cells often migrate in response to specific external signals, including chemical signals and mechanical signals. Errors during this process have serious consequences, including intellectual disability, vascular disease, tumor formation and metastasis. An understanding of the mechanism by which cells migrate may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for controlling, for example, <b>invasive</b> <b>tumour</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R

Classifying groups of samples based on their metabolic profile {{is one of the main}} topics of metabolomics research. Crisp clustering methods assign each feature to one cluster, thereby omitting information about the multiplicity of sample subtypes. Here, we present the applicationof fuzzy K-means clusteringmethod for the classificationof samples basedonmetabolomics 1 D 1 HNMRfingerprints. The sample classification was performed on NMR spectra of cancer cell line extracts and of urine samples of type 2 diabetes patients and animalmodels. The cell line dataset includedNMRspectra of lipophilic cell extracts for twonormal and three cancer cell lines with cancer cell lines including two invasive and one non-invasive cancers. The second dataset included previously published NMR spectra of urine samples of human type 2 diabetics and healthy controls, mouse wild type and diabetes model and rat obese and lean phenotypes. The fuzzy K-means clusteringmethod allowedmore accurate sample classification in both datasets relative to the other tested methods including principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical clustering (HCL) and K-means clustering.

40|$|AIMS: To {{determine}} if the immunocytochemical delineation of subepithelial basement membrane {{can be used in}} the assessment of questionable early invasive cervical carcinoma. METHODS: The distribution of immunoreactive type IV collagen was examined in 15 cervical biopsy specimens in which the reporting pathologist had specifically described difficulty in assessing or excluding early invasion of subepithelial stroma associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). The results were compared with those from biopsy specimens showing CIN III (N = 8), carcinoma with definite early stromal infiltration (FIGO stage 1 a 1) (n = 6), and more advanced invasive squamous tumours (FIGO stages 1 a 2 to 3) (n = 8). In all cases the immunocytochemical findings were assessed in relation to serial sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin. RESULTS: Six of the 15 diagnostically problematic biopsy specimens were considered, on review, to show early infiltration of subepithelial tissue and putative invasive foci were consistently absent in basement membrane. A similar pattern was observed in the "definite" early invasive cases. Eight problematic biopsy specimens were considered to show only in situ neoplasia; five of these had intact though occasionally attenuated basement membrane, three showed focal type IV collagen defects. In the remaining case biopsy trauma precluded further assessment. Basement membrane defects were identified in five of eight cases of CIN III, while three of eight squamous carcinomas showed partial retention of type IV collagen immunoreactivity around <b>invasive</b> <b>tumour</b> <b>cell</b> nests. CONCLUSIONS: Defects in subepithelial basement membrane occur in in situ and invasive neoplasia in the uterine cervix. Immunocytochemical staining for type IV collagen is of limited diagnostic value in the assessment of biopsy specimens with questionable early stromal invasion...|$|E

In this situation, reliable assessment of pathological tumour response to NAC is vital in order to select the most appropriate surgical plan. An imaging modality that could assess tumour response to NAC would be beneficial, providing it could detect any residual disease present. This could result in a surgical treatment plan more tailored to the individual patient. In addition, pathological complete response (pCR, i.e. the absence of any residual <b>invasive</b> <b>tumour</b> <b>cells)</b> on NAC has shown to be a prognostic factor for overall better survival, disease-free survival and recurrence-free survival [2].

40|$|<b>Invasive</b> <b>tumour</b> <b>cells,</b> such as gliomas, {{frequently}} express EGF (epidermal growth factor) receptor at a {{high level}} and they exhibit enhanced cell migration in response to EGF. We reported previously that <b>tumour</b> <b>cell</b> migration is associated with ectodomain cleavage of CD 44, the major adhesion molecule that is implicated in tumour invasion and metastasis, and that the cleavage is enhanced by ligation of CD 44. In the present study, we show that EGF promotes CD 44 cleavage and CD 44 -dependent cell migration. Introduction of a dominant-negative mutant of the small GTPase Rac 1 or depletion of Rac 1 by RNAi (RNA interference) abrogated CD 44 cleavage induced by EGF. Treatment with PD 98059, an inhibitor for MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase kinase), also suppressed the CD 44 cleavage. Furthermore, RNAi studies showed that EGF induced ADAM 10 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10) -dependent CD 44 cleavage and cell migration. These results indicate that EGF induces ADAM 10 -mediated CD 44 cleavage through Rac 1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, and thereby promotes <b>tumour</b> <b>cell</b> migration and invasion...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic actin remodelling {{processes}} at {{the leading}} edge of migrating <b>tumour</b> <b>cells</b> are concerted events controlled by a fine-tuned temporal and spatial interplay of kinases and phosphatases. Actin severing is regulated by ADF/Cofilin which regulates stimulus-induced lamellipodia protrusion and directed cell motility. Cofilin is activated by dephosphorylation via phosphatases of the slingshot (SSH) family. SSH activity is strongly increased by its binding to filamentous actin (F-actin), however, other upstream regulators remain unknown. We show that in response to RhoA activation, Protein Kinase D 1 (PKD 1) phosphorylates the SSH enzyme SSH 1 L at a serine residue located in its actin binding motif. This generates a 14 - 3 - 3 binding motif, blocks the localization of SSH 1 L to F-actin-rich structures in the lamellipodium by sequestering it in the cytoplasm. Consequently, expression of constitutively-active PKD 1 in <b>invasive</b> <b>tumour</b> <b>cells</b> enhanced phosphorylation of cofilin and effectively blocked the formation of free actin filament barbed ends and directed cell migration.

40|$|Glioblastoma {{remains one}} of the most lethal types of cancer, and is the most common brain tumour in adults. In particular, tumour {{recurrence}} after surgical resection and radiation invariably occurs regardless of aggressive chemotherapy. Here, we provide evidence that the transcription factor ZEB 1 (zinc finger E‐box binding homeobox 1) exerts simultaneous influence over invasion, chemoresistance and tumourigenesis in glioblastoma. ZEB 1 is preferentially expressed in invasive glioblastoma cells, where the ZEB 1 ‐miR‐ 200 feedback loop interconnects these processes through the downstream effectors ROBO 1, c‐MYB and MGMT. Moreover, ZEB 1 expression in glioblastoma patients is predictive of shorter survival and poor Temozolomide response. Our findings indicate that this regulator of epithelial‐mesenchymal transition orchestrates key features of cancer stem cells in malignant glioma and identify ROBO 1, OLIG 2, CD 133 and MGMT as novel targets of the ZEB 1 pathway. Thus, ZEB 1 is an important candidate molecule for glioblastoma recurrence, a marker of <b>invasive</b> <b>tumour</b> <b>cells</b> and a potential therapeutic target, along with its downstream effectors...|$|R

In all, 154 lesions were studied, using antibodies to laminin and type IV collagen and an indirect immunoperoxidase technique. The staining patterns seen with the two antibodies were virtually identical, although that of laminin was generally fainter. Breaks in and thinning of the normally continuous line of type IV collagen and laminin at the dermo-epidermal junction were seen {{in association with the}} junctional activity of benign naevi, and in malignant melanomas in association with <b>invasive</b> <b>tumour</b> <b>cells.</b> Both benign and malignant cells of the melanocyte series showed relatively light pericellular staining around individual cells and clusters of cells in the papillary dermis.

40|$|Basal cell {{carcinoma}} cells show low proliferation rates at the invasive {{front and a}} concordant upregulation of the cdk-inhibitor p 16, limiting proliferative capacity. Little {{is known about the}} mechanisms of p 16 regulation in normal and malignant cells apart from that many transcription factors such as Ets 1, Ets 2, SP 1, SP 3, JunB and the polycomb protein Bmi 1 have the potential to induce or repress p 16 expression. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} determine how p 16 is regulated in basal {{cell carcinoma}} with special focus on its upregulation in invasive cells. By analysing various microdissected areas of basal cell carcinoma using real-time quantitative PCR we observed upregulation of p 16 mRNA in <b>invasive</b> <b>tumour</b> <b>cells</b> compared to centrally localized <b>tumour</b> <b>cells.</b> The methylation status of the p 16 promoter, analysed by methylation-specific PCR, also showed diminished methylation in <b>tumour</b> <b>cells</b> at the <b>invasive</b> front, supporting the hypothesis that promoter methylation can affect the transcriptional activation of p 16 in vivo. There was only sporadic co-localization of Ets, or ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation with p 16 upregulation at the invasive front, suggesting that these factors were not directly involved in the regulation of p 16. Furthermore, the gamma 2 chain of laminin- 332 has been reported to be increased at the invasive front compared to the central areas of many tumours. Interestingly, in basal cell carcinoma we observed partial co-localization between p 16 and the gamma 2 chain of laminin- 332 in <b>tumour</b> <b>cells</b> towards areas of ulceration and in the majority of clearly infiltrative <b>tumour</b> <b>cells</b> but not in p 16 positive <b>tumour</b> <b>cells</b> with a more pushing invasive growth pattern. These data suggest that concurrent p 16 upregulation and decreased proliferation are more general phenomena in different types of invasive growth patterns in basal cell carcinomas and that these only partially overlap with the gamma 2 chain of laminin- 332 associated invasion patterns.

METHODS: Therefore, the expression of CD 31 (pan endothelial cells (ECs)), endoglin (actively proliferating ECs), hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 (HIF- 1 alpha), vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) and tissue factor (TF) were quantified in 140 surgical specimens comprising normal human breast, benign and pre-malignant hyperplastic tissue, in situ and invasive breast cancer specimens. RESULTS: Significant increases in angiogenesis (microvessel density) were observed between normal and benign hyperplastic breast tissue (P< 0. 005), and between in situ and invasive carcinomas (P< 0. 0005). In addition, significant increases in proliferating ECs were observed in benign hyperplastic breast compared with normal breast (P< 0. 05) cancers and in invasive compared with in situ cancers (P< 0. 005). Hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 alpha, VEGF and TF expression were significantly associated with increases in both angiogenesis and proliferating ECs (P< 0. 05). Moreover, HIF- 1 alpha was expressed by 60 - 75 % of the hyperplastic lesions, and a significant association was observed between VEGF and TF in ECs (P< 0. 005) and <b>invasive</b> <b>tumour</b> <b>cells</b> (P< 0. 01).

40|$|Macrophage {{migration}} inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic cytokine and mediator {{of acute}} and chronic inflammatory diseases. MIF is overexpressed in various tumours {{and has been}} suggested as a molecular link between chronic inflammation and cancer. In {{the context of the}} present study we investigated the role of MIF in tumorigenesis of breast cancer. MIF was abundantly expressed in the non-invasive breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB- 468 and ZR- 75 - 1, but not in invasive MDA-MB- 231 cells, which in turn expressed higher levels of the MIF-receptor CD 74. These cells are markedly more sensitive to stimulation with exogenous, recombinant MIF by increasing their own level of MIF secretion. The interesting point was that exogenous MIF influences the endogenous MIF secretion in all cell types, so that there must be kind of a feedback loop via an autocrine loop. Functional assays showed that autocrine MIF promoted <b>tumour</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation, as indicated by blockade of MIF or CD 74 in MDA-MB- 231 and MDA-MB- 468. Similar effects were investigated in adhesion assays. We demonstrated that MIF influences cell adhesion and especially adhesion in non-invasive MDA-MB- 468 cells which could be blocked by anti-MIF or anti-CD 74 -antibodies. Surprisingly proliferation and adhesion of normal breast tissue cells could be influenced only very little by stimulation or blockade. Also MDA-MB- 231 invasiveness was enhanced by exogenous MIF and thus the inflammatory cytokine probably activates matrix-metalloproteinases, which are involved in degradation of basement membrane. In following studies we correlated the expression of MIF with different histopathological parameters and received first hints that lower cytosolic MIF expression levels could be found in breast cancer patients with bad prognosis. We concluded that MIF {{plays an important role in}} tumorigenesis and invasive behaviour of breast cancer. <b>Invasive</b> <b>tumour</b> <b>cells</b> seem to develop more effective adaptation to MIF stimulation. Furthermore intracellular expression of MIF in breast cancer is beneficial, whereas extracellular MIF may play a pro-oncogenic role in promoting breast cancer cell-stroma interactions...|$|R

Clinical and pathological features of 248 patients with LABC, who were treated with multimodality treatments including neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical surgery and radiotherapy were reassessed. Tumour samples obtained at surgery were evaluated using standard immunohistochemical methods. Overall, 141 patients (57 %) presented with NIBC (cT 4 a-c, N 0 - 2, M 0) and 107 patients (43 %) with IBC (cT 4 d, N 0 - 2, M 0). Median follow-up time was 27. 5 months (range: 1. 6 – 87. 8).

40|$|Adhesion, which {{includes}} cell-to-cell and cell-to-extracellular-matrix adhesion, {{plays an important}} role in cancer invasion and metastasis. After undergoing morphological changes malignant and <b>invasive</b> <b>tumour</b> <b>cells,</b> i. e., cancer cells, break away from the primary tumour by loss of cell-cell adhesion, degrade their basement membrane and migrate through the extracellular matrix by enhancement of cell-matrix adhesion. These processes require interactions and signalling cross-talks between proteins and cellular components facilitating the cell adhesion. Although such processes are very complex, the necessity to fully understand the mechanism of cell adhesion is crucial for cancer studies, which may contribute to improving cancer treatment strategies. We consider mathematical models in an attempt to understand better the roles of cell adhesion involved in cancer invasion. Using mathematical models and computational simulations, the underlying complex biological processes can be better understood and their properties can be predicted that might not be evident in laboratory experiments. Cancer cell migration and invasion of the extracellular matrix involving adhesive interactions between cells mediated by cadherins and between cell and matrix mediated by integrins, are modelled by employing two types of mathematical models: a continuum approach and an individual-based approach. In the continuum approach, we use Partial Differential Equations in which cell adhesion is treated as non-local and formulated by integral terms. In the individual-based approach, we first develop pathways for cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion using Ordinary Differential Equations and later incorporate the pathways in a simulation environment for multiscale computational modelling. The computational simulation results from the two different mathematical models show that we can predict invasive behaviour of cancer cells from cell adhesion properties. Invasion occurs if we reduce cell-cell adhesion and increase cell-matrix adhesion and vice versa. Changing the cell adhesion properties can affect the spatio-temporal behaviour of cancer cell invasion. These results may lead to broadening our understanding of cancer cell invasion and in the long term, contributing to methods of patient treatment.

40|$|Metastasis is {{the main}} cause of death from solid cancer. The {{dissemination}} of cancer cells from a primary tumour is a very complex process that involves many steps and cells must overcome many obstacles to colonize distant organs. The tumour microenvironment influences the mode and the dynamics of invasion of cancer cells. Cancer cells have the ability to adapt to distinct environmental conditions in order to stay motile. Invasive cancer cells form membrane protrusions called invadopodia that are able to degrade extracellular matrix. The formation of invadopodia by cancer cells is interconnected to the production of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Metastasizing <b>tumour</b> <b>cells</b> use MMPs to break through extracellular matrix barriers and migrate in dense matrix. Both invadopodia formation and MMPs secretion is crucial for the degradation of the extracellular matrix. The most important is the membrane bound MMP- 14 (MT 1 -MMP) and soluble MMP- 2 and MMP- 9.

Colcemid, which inhibits the formation of cell processes and the directional migration of cells, and dibutyryl cyclic AMP, which restores certain aspects of normal behaviour to <b>tumour</b> <b>cells</b> in vitro, had little effect on the invasion of the membrane by <b>tumour</b> <b>cells.</b> THE MECHANISMS by which <b>tumour</b> <b>cells</b> infiltrate normal host tissues are poorly understood (Easty, 1966).

40|$|Introduction: The homeobox-containing {{transcription}} factor muscle segment homeobox 2 (Msx 2) {{plays an important}} role in mammary gland development. However, the clinical implications of Msx 2 expression in breast cancer are unclear. The aims of this study were to investigate the potential clinical value of Msx 2 as a breast cancer biomarker and to clarify its functional role in vitro. Methods: Msx 2 gene expression was first examined in a well-validated breast cancer transcriptomic dataset of 295 patients. Msx 2 protein expression was then evaluated by immunohistochemistry in a tissue microarray (TMA) containing 281 <b>invasive</b> breast <b>tumours.</b> Finally, to assess the functional role of Msx 2 in vitro, Msx 2 was ectopically expressed in a highly <b>invasive</b> breast <b>tumour</b> <b>cell</b> line (MDA-MB- 231) and an immortalised breast cell line (MCF 10 a), and these cell lines were examined for changes in growth rate, cell death and cell signalling. Results: Examination of Msx 2 mRNA expression in a breast cancer transcriptomic dataset demonstrated that increased levels of Msx 2 were associated with good prognosis (P = 0. 011). Evaluation of Msx 2 protein expression on a TMA revealed that Msx 2 was detectable in both <b>tumour</b> <b>cell</b> nuclei and cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic Msx 2 expression was associated with low grade tumours (P = 0. 012) and Ki 67 negativity (P = 0. 018). Nuclear Msx 2 correlated with low-grade tumours (P = 0. 015), estrogen receptor positivity (P = 0. 038), low Ki 67 (P = 0. 005) and high cyclin D 1 expression (P = 0. 037). Increased cytoplasmic Msx 2 expression was associated with a prolonged breast cancer-specific survival (P = 0. 049), recurrence-free survival (P = 0. 029) and overall survival (P = 0. 019). Ectopic expression of Msx 2 in breast cell lines resulted in radically decreased cell viability mediated by induction of cell death via apoptosis. Further analysis of Msx 2 -expressing cells revealed increased levels of p 21 and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and decreased levels of Survivin and the 'split ends' (SPEN) protein family member RBM 15. Conclusions: We conclude that increased Msx 2 expression results in improved outcome for breast cancer patients, possibly by increasing the likelihood of <b>tumour</b> <b>cell</b> death by apoptosis...|$|R
40|$|The fourth {{edition of}} the World Health Organization (WHO) {{classification}} of urogenital tumours (WHO "blue book"), published in 2016, contains significant revisions. These revisions were performed after consideration by a large international group of pathologists with special expertise in this area. A subgroup of these persons met at the WHO Consensus Conference in Zurich, Switzerland, in 2015 to finalize the revisions. This review summarizes the most {{significant differences between the}} newly published classification and the prior version for renal, penile, and testicular tumours. Newly recognized epithelial renal tumours are hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) syndrome-associated RCC, succinate dehydrogenase-deficient RCC, tubulocystic RCC, acquired cystic disease-associated RCC, and clear cell papillary RCC. The WHO/International Society of Urological Pathology renal tumour grading system was recommended, and the definition of renal papillary adenoma was modified. The new WHO classification of penile squamous cell carcinomas is based on the presence of human papillomavirus and defines histologic subtypes accordingly. Germ cell neoplasia in situ (GCNIS) of the testis is the WHO-recommended term for precursor lesions of <b>invasive</b> germ <b>cell</b> <b>tumours,</b> and testicular germ <b>cell</b> <b>tumours</b> are now separated into two fundamentally different groups: those derived from GCNIS and those unrelated to GCNIS. Spermatocytic seminoma has been designated as a spermatocytic tumour and placed within the group of non-GCNIS-related tumours in the 2016 WHO classification. PATIENT SUMMARY The 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification contains new renal tumour entities. The classification of penile squamous cell carcinomas is based on the presence of human papillomavirus. Germ cell neoplasia in situ of the testis is the WHO-recommended term for precursor lesions of <b>invasive</b> germ <b>cell</b> <b>tumours...</b>|$|R
40|$|Catenins (alpha, beta, and gamma) are a {{group of}} {{proteins}} linking E-cadherin with the cytoskeleton. Reduced expression of alpha catenin {{has been shown in}} some cancer lines and tissues and is related to the <b>invasive</b> nature of <b>tumour</b> <b>cells.</b> This study examined the effects of n- 6 PUFAs on the expression of catenins in a range of human cancer cells by Western blotting. Although most of the cell lines expressed similar levels of beta and gamma catenins, a number of cell lines expressed low levels of alpha catenin. Treatment of cells with gamma linolenic acid (GLA) increased alpha catenin expression in most cell lines, while beta catenin levels were reduced, and gamma catenin expression was unchanged. Linoleic acid and arachidonic acid had not significant effects. We conclude that in human cancer cell lines, the expression of alpha and beta catenins can be regulated by gamma linolenic aci...|$|R
40|$|Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) {{represent}} {{a group of}} enzymes involved in the degradation {{of most of the}} components of the extracellular matrix and therefore participate in tumoural invasion. MMPs, especially gelatinases A and B, MT 1 -MMP, the activator of gelatinase A, and stromelysin- 3 were found overexpressed in many cancers including bronchopulmonary carcinomas. In vivo observations revealed that fibroblasts are the principal source of production of MMPs. Some of these enzymes such as MT 1 -MMP and stromelysin 3, displayed a focal stromal localisation near preinvasive and <b>invasive</b> <b>tumour</b> clusters. Furthermore, some <b>tumour</b> <b>cell</b> lines were shown to stimulate the expression of MT 1 -MMP by fibroblasts. All these in vivo and in vitro results suggest that certain <b>tumour</b> <b>cells</b> produce diffusible factors which could influence the MMP stromal expression. Among these factors, the TCSF (Tumor Collagenase Stimulatory Factor) which is known to upregulate some MMPs in vitro could be a good candidate for this stromal regulation, since it is produced by bronchial <b>tumour</b> <b>cells</b> in vivo. In this review, we address such a cooperation between <b>tumour</b> and stromal <b>cells</b> for the production of MMPs and emphasize their necessity for tumoural progression in bronchopulmonary carcinomasPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Peritoneal {{dissemination}} is {{a frequent}} metastatic route for cancers of the ovary and gastrointestinal tract. <b>Tumour</b> <b>cells</b> metastasize by attaching to and invading through the mesothelial cell (MC) monolayer that lines the peritoneal cavity. Metastases are influenced by carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a cell population that derives from different sources. Hence, we investigated whether MCs, through mesothelial-mesenchymal transition (MMT), were a source of CAFs during peritoneal carcinomatosis and whether MMT affected the adhesion and invasion of <b>tumour</b> <b>cells.</b> Biopsies from patients with peritoneal dissemination revealed the presence of myofibroblasts expressing mesothelial markers in the proximity of carcinoma implants. Prominent new vessel formation was observed in the peritoneal areas harbouring <b>tumour</b> <b>cells</b> when compared with tumour-free regions. The use of a mouse model of peritoneal dissemination confirmed the myofibroblast conversion of MCs {{and the increase in}} angiogenesis at places of tumour implants. Treatment of omentum MCs with conditioned media from carcinoma cell cultures resulted in phenotype changes reminiscent of MMT. Adhesion experiments demonstrated that MMT enhanced the binding of cancer cells to MCs in a β 1 -integrin-dependent manner. Scanning electron microscopy imaging showed that the enhanced adhesion was mostly due to increased cell-cell interaction and not to a mere matrix exposure. Invasion assays suggested a reciprocal stimulation of the <b>invasive</b> capacity of <b>tumour</b> <b>cells</b> and MCs. Our results demonstrate that CAFs can derive from mesothelial cells during peritoneal metastasis. We suggest that MMT renders the peritoneum more receptive for <b>tumour</b> <b>cell</b> attachment/invasion and contributes to secondary tumour growth by promoting its vascularization.

40|$|Neoplastic {{progression}} of solid tumours is often {{characterized by a}} simultaneous increase in matrix protein (eg collagen) synthesis and degradation, and results {{in the formation of}} a tumour stroma. At the tumour periphery, this process is believed to facilitate angiogenesis and <b>invasive</b> growth of <b>tumour</b> <b>cells.</b> In various types of carcinoma, differentiation of fibroblasts towards myofibroblasts is thought {{to play an important role}} in extracellular matrix remodelling as their emergence coincides with architectural changes in the tumour stroma. Here, distinct architectural changes in collagen fibres are reported in cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cSCC) with respect to normal skin and precursor lesions, ie keratinocytic intraepidermal neoplasia (KIN). Simultaneously, type I collagen mRNA was observed in fibroblasts in close proximity to cSCC lesions (19 / 19) but only in 2 of 10 KIN lesions tested. Interestingly, whereas emerging of myofibroblasts correlated with reduced differentiation of cSCCs, it was not a prerequisite for type I collagen synthesis. These data indicate that type I collagen synthesis by fibroblasts parallels the malignant transformation of human KIN to cSCC...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Histological {{diagnosis}} of malignant mesothelioma requires an invasive procedure such as CT-guided needle biopsy, thoracoscopy, video-assisted thorascopic surgery (VATs) or thoracotomy. These <b>invasive</b> procedures encourage <b>tumour</b> <b>cell</b> seeding at the intervention site and patients can develop tumour nodules within the chest wall. In {{an effort to}} prevent nodules developing, it has been widespread practice across Europe to irradiate intervention sites postprocedure—a practice known as prophylactic irradiation of tracts (PIT). To date {{there has not been}} a suitably powered randomised trial to determine whether PIT is effective at reducing the risk of chest wall nodule development. Methods and analysis In this multicentre phase III randomised controlled superiority trial, 374 patients who can receive radiotherapy within 42  days of a chest wall intervention will be randomised to receive PIT or no PIT. Patients will be randomised on a 1 : 1 basis. Radiotherapy in the PIT arm will be 21  Gy in three fractions. Subsequent chemotherapy is given at the clinicians’ discretion. A reduction in the incidence of chest wall nodules from 15...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCarcinoma {{progression}} {{is associated}} with the loss of epithelial features, and the acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics and <b>invasive</b> properties by <b>tumour</b> <b>cells.</b> The loss of cell-cell contacts may be the first step of the epithelium mesenchyme transition (EMT) and involves the functional inactivation of the cell-cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin. Repression of E-cadherin expression by the transcription factor Snail is a central event during the loss of epithelial phenotype. Akt kinase activation is frequent in human carcinomas, and Akt regulates various cellular mechanisms including EMT. Here, we show that Snail activation and consequent repression of E-cadherin may depend on AKT-mediated nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, and that NF-kappaB induces Snail expression. Expression of the NF-kappaB subunit p 65 is sufficient for EMT induction, validating this signalling module during EMT. NF-kappaB pathway activation {{is associated with}} tumour progression and metastasis of several human tumour types; E-cadherin acts as a metastasis suppressor protein. Thus, this signalling and transcriptional network linking AKT, NF-kappaB, Snail and E-cadherin during EMT is a potential target for antimetastatic therapeutics...|$|R
