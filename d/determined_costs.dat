The quantification of synthesis costs of metabolites, in terms of consumed energy, is a prerequisite to understand trade-offs arising from energetic limitations. Here, we examine the energy consumption of amino acid synthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. To quantify these costs {{in terms of the}} energy equivalent ATP, we introduce an improved cost measure based on flux balance analysis and apply it to three state-of-the-art metabolic reconstructions to ensure robust results. We present the first systematic in silico analysis of the effect of nitrogen supply (nitrate/ammonium) on individual amino acid synthesis costs {{as well as of the}} effect of photoautotrophic and heterotrophic growth conditions, integrating day/night-specific regulation.

40|$|The {{theory of}} sexual {{conflict}} predicts that sexual coevolution {{will be very}} dynamic, with in principle perpetual evolutionary arms races and chases. These arms races are expected to stop once the costs of conflict adaptations become too high. We argue that this prediction is contingent on specific assumptions about the sexual interaction and the adaptations involved in the arms race. More generally, evolutionary arms races stop when the fitness benefit of further escalations is outweighed by the fitness costs. For this {{it is not necessary}} that the absolute costs of conflict must be high at the stable state, or that the population fitness must be decreased at equilibrium. We expect the outcome of sexual antagonistic coevolution to be determined by the possibility to reach compromises and by the relative ability of each sex to control the outcome of the interaction. We exemplify with a theoretical conflict model, which leads to population extinction when conflict is settled by armaments with expression-level <b>determined</b> <b>costs.</b> The model predicts a compromise with small conflict costs for the population, if costs are in addition determined by the extent of conflict between the sexes, which may be the case when the cost depends on behavioural antagonism...|$|E

40|$|This project {{assessed}} {{the feasibility of}} a Power Ultra-Uprate on an existing nuclear plant. The study determined the technical and design limitations of the current components, {{both inside and outside}} the containment. Based on the identified plant bottlenecks, the design changes for major pieces of equipment required to meet the Power Ultra-Uprate throughput were <b>determined.</b> <b>Costs</b> for modified pieces of equipment and for change-out and disposal of the replaced equipment were evaluated. These costs were then used to develop capital, fuel and operating and maintenance cost estimates for the Power Ultra-Uprate plant. The cost evaluation indicates that the largest cost components are the replacement of power (during the outage required for the uprate) and the new fuel loading. Based on these results, the study concluded that, for a ?standard? 4 -loop plant, the proposed Power Ultra-Uprate is technically feasible. However, the power uprate is likely to be more expensive than the cost (per Kw electric installed) of a new plant when large capacity uprates are considered (> 25 %). Nevertheless, the concept of the Power Ultra-Uprate may be an attractive option for specific nuclear power plants where a large margin exists in the steam and power conversion system or where medium power increases (~ 600 MWe) are needed. The results of the study suggest that development efforts on fuel technologies for current nuclear power plants should be oriented towards improving the fuel performance (fretting-wear, corrosion, uranium load, manufacturing, safety) required to achieve higher burnup rather focusing on potential increases in the fuel thermal output...|$|E
40|$|Background: Survival for {{childhood}} acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) {{has reached}} 80 - 90 %. Future improvement in treatment success will involve {{new technologies and}} medication, adding to the pressure on limited financial resources. Therefore a retrospective cost-effectiveness analysis of ALL treatment with chemotherapy only according to the two most recent Dutch Childhood Oncology Group treatment protocols was performed. The most recent protocol ALL 10 included more expensive medication (pegasparaginase) and implemented a new diagnostic technique (minimal residual disease levels) compared to the previous ALL 9 protocol. Procedure: Fifty children from a single center cohort were included. All direct medical costs made during treatment, including those in satellite hospitals, were <b>determined.</b> <b>Costs</b> per life year saved (LYS) were calculated. The cost-effectiveness ratio {{of the most recent}} treatment protocol was determined. LYS were calculated based on national 5 -year event-free survival. Results: Mean total costs were between $ 115, 858 (ALL 9) and $ 163, 350 (ALL 10) per patient. Hospital admissions (57 %) and medication (11 - 17 %) were important drivers of overall costs, and were higher in the most recent protocol ALL 10. Costs per LYS were $ 1, 962 (ALL 9) and $ 2, 655 (ALL 10) and the cost-effectiveness ratio was $ 8, 215. Conclusion: Treatment of childhood ALL with chemotherapy only is well within accepted ranges of cost-effectiveness. The use of new technology and more expensive medication in the most recent protocol ALL 10 lead to higher costs but more LYS. In future (ALL) treatment protocols, costs in relation to effects should be taken into account in order to establish more cost-effective disease management without jeopardizing survival and quality of life. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E

We <b>determined</b> <b>costs</b> per isolation day avoided, and incremental costs of rapid MRSA screening tests when added to conventional screening, but with decisions on isolation measures based on PCR results. A prospective multicentre study evaluating BD GeneOhm MRSA PCR (`IDI') (BD Diagnostics, San Diego, CA, USA), Xpert MRSA (`GeneXpert') (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and chromogenic agar (MRSA-ID) (bioMérieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France) was performed in 14 Dutch hospitals. Among 1764 patients at risk, MRSA prevalence was 3. 3 % (n= 59). Duration of isolation was 19. 7 and 16. 1 h with IDI and GeneXpert, respectively, and would have been 30. 0 and 76. 2 h when based on chromogenic agar and conventional cultures, respectively. Negative predictive values (at a patient level) were 99. 5 %, 99. 1 % and 99. 5 % for IDI, GeneXpert and chromogenic agar, respectively. Numbers of isolation days were reduced by 60 % and 47 % with PCR-based and chromogenic agar-based screening, respectively. The cost per test was € 56. 22 for IDI, € 69. 62 for GeneXpert and € 2. 08 for chromogenic agar, and additional costs per extra isolation day were € 26. 34. Costs per isolation day avoided were € 95. 77 (IDI) and € 125. 43 (GeneXpert). PCR-based decision-making added € 153. 64 (IDI) and € 193. 84 (GeneXpert) per patient to overall costs and chromogenic testing would have saved € 30. 79 per patient.

40|$|Objective: The {{value of}} early {{detection}} of subclinical hypothyroidism {{is the object of}} a long lasting debate. In this study, we assessed the cost effectiveness of a policy based upon screening for this condition through thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T 3) and thyroxine (T 4) serum level measurements in the elderly. Design: A Markov model was developed where hypothetical elderly patients (i. e. >= 60 years of age), who attend general practitioner (GP) clinics for periodic health examinations in a primary-care setting in Italy, made transitions between health states at annual intervals for 15 years, thus allowing an estimation of the average cost and of the expected average number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). In this model, patients were assumed to be seen at annual intervals by GPs for clinical examination and serum cholesterol level measurement, to which a TSH, T 3 and T 4 serum measurement was added. In the base-case analysis, TSH was measured every 5 years and, if abnormal, T 3 and T 4 serum levels were also <b>determined.</b> <b>Costs</b> were analysed {{from the perspective of the}} Italian National Health Service (NHS) and reflected 1996 values. Main outcome measures and results: In the base-case analysis, the additional benefit estimated from testing a female population for subclinical hypothyroidism every 5 years was 0. 36 QALY, with a cost per QALY gained of 668 298 lire (L). The expected gain in QALY for men was 0. 20 and the cost per QALY gained was L 270 322. In general, the best cost-effectiveness profile was seen with testing every 3 years. Results were sensitive to variations in the prevalence of disease among the target population, both in men and women. Conclusions: Our study indicates that a screening policy for subclinical hypothyroidism in the elderly population could be worthwhile. However, as the costs could be significant when applied at the population level, this policy deserves further assessment through well-designed primary research.

40|$|Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), and Trichomonas vaginalis {{are common}} sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STI) worldwide, which {{are associated with}} adverse maternal and infant outcomes. Diagnostic testing accompanied by partner notification and treatment are important strategies for control of STIs. Yet most countries do not provide routine diagnostic testing for pregnant women and partner notification rates are low. While molecular diagnostics are available, the implementation costs are a barrier for many countries. This dissertation examined three aspects of efforts to address the STI burden among pregnant women in Botswana, based on a pilot point-of-care STI testing and treatment program in Gaborone. The first study examined the prevalence and correlates of CT, NG, and TV among pregnant women receiving antenatal care and found an infection rate of 14 %. HIV infection and being unmarried were associated with having an STI. Self-reported STI-related symptoms were not associated with having an STI. The second study used qualitative interviews to assess the experiences and preferences related to partner notification among pregnant women who tested positive for an STI. The majority of women {{had never heard of}} CT, NG, or TV infections prior to testing. Thirteen out of 15 participants had notified partners about the STI diagnosis. The majority of notified partners received some treatment. Most women expressed a preference for accompanying partners to the clinic for treatment. The third study <b>determined</b> <b>costs</b> and outcomes associated with CT and NG infection testing and treatment at an antenatal clinic. Data from this single site were modelled to estimate scale-up across Botswana according to three scenarios. Models revealed that point-of-care testing would result in the most of women cured, but at the highest cost. A centralized laboratory scenario was associated with the lowest cost, but fewer women cured. A mixed scenario had the most favorable cost per outcome. CT, NG, and TV infections remain a significant burden among pregnant women in Botswana. Women are generally receptive to point-of-care STI testing and partner notification. Policy-makers should consider a mixed approach to scaling up STI testing and treatment to maximize population level benefits while controlling associated costs...|$|E
