5000|$|Snap peas (Pisum sativum var. macrocarpon), {{also known}} as sugar snap peas, are a {{cultivar}} group of <b>edible-podded</b> <b>peas</b> that differ from snow peas in that their pods are round as opposed to flat. The name mangetout (French for [...] "eat all") can apply both to snap peas and snow peas.|$|E
50|$|Snap peas, {{like all}} other peas, are pod fruits. An <b>edible-podded</b> <b>pea</b> {{is similar to a}} garden, or English, pea, but the pod is less fibrous, and edible when young. Pods of the <b>edible-podded</b> <b>pea,</b> {{including}} snap peas, do not have a membrane and do not open when ripe. At maturity, the pods grow to around 4-8 cm in length, Pods contain three to eight peas per pod. The plants are climbing, and pea sticks or a trellis or other support system is required for optimal growth. Some cultivars are capable of climbing to 2 m high but are more commonly around 1-1.3 m for ease of harvest.|$|R
40|$|Thirty-three <b>edible-pod</b> <b>pea</b> (Pisum sativum L.) lines {{selected}} from single plants within 11 snow pea landraces and three elite cultivars were evaluated for their horticultural value in three field trials at Pontevedra and Lugo (Northwestern Spain). Field performance was estimated according to six traits related to earliness and duration, while horticultural value {{was determined by}} five pod traits. The global pod quality was estimated by a taste panel. Lines showed significant differences in nine quantitative traits. Significant differences were found among means of five landraces and the lines selected within them for pod length, width and weight. Cluster and principal component analysis identified a main group of 16 lines derived mainly from landraces PSM- 0112 and PSM- 0227 that had desirable earliness and pod quality. Some of the lines, such as MB- 0298, MB- 0324, MB- 0325, MB- 0326, MB- 0332, and MB- 0334 are appropriate for vegetable production as edible pod snow pea varieties and for use in breeding programs. Moreover, the lines MB- 0298, MB- 0321, MB- 0322 and MB- 0324 showed stable earliness and MB- 0330 and MB- 0332 stable pod quality across the three environments evaluated. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Sugar snap pea (Pisum sativum L. var. macrocarpon Ser.) is an <b>edible-podded</b> sweet <b>pea</b> that {{is being}} {{considered}} as a new totally mechanized crop to supply raw material to the agri-food industry of the Ebro Valley (Northern Spain). It is of great interest from an agronomic and commercial standpoint but neither its agronomic behaviour nor its adaptation to the area are known. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of sowing date and seed density on the growth and yield of the sugar snap pea at industrial scale. Six randomized blocks experiments with four replicates were conducted on irrigated land in Villafranca (Navarra, Spain) in 1998, 1999, and 2000. Three experiments for testing sowing dates (Mar., Apr., and May) and another three for seed densities (from 75 to 150 plants m - 2) were performed. Phenological development, thermal integral and qualitative and quantitative yield controls were performed. Sugar snap pea required 960 oC d - 1 (T b = 3 oC) from sowing to harvest. The early sowings gave more biomass, but yield was similar. However, Harvest Index and crop morphology varied. The sowing densities had similar yields sowing that sugar snap pea has a bigger adaptation availability. Sugar snap peas can be satisfactorily cultivated at industrial scale in the zone with sowings between Mar. and May and with seeding densities between 75 and 150 plants m - 2. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
