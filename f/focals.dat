40|$|Alien {{plant species}} can alter {{pollinator}} visitation and, in turn, the sexual reproduction of natives. Using a conventional and a phylogenetically controlled meta-analytical approach on a data set of 40 studies, we evaluated {{the effect of}} alien neighbour plant species (aliens) on visitation to and reproduction of native co-flowering focal species (<b>focals),</b> and compared such effect to that of native neighbours (natives). An overall significantly negative effect of aliens on visitation to and reproduction of <b>focals</b> was confirmed. Interestingly, aliens differed from natives in their effect on visitation, but not on reproductive success. The negative effect of aliens on visitation and reproductive success increased at high relative alien plant abundance, but this increase was proportionally lower than the increase in relative plant abundance. Likewise, effect of aliens on visitation and reproductive success was most detrimental when alien and focal species had similar flower symmetry or colour. The phylogenetic relatedness between alien neighbours and <b>focals</b> influenced the reproductive success effect size. Results of the phylogenetic meta-analysis were only partly {{consistent with those of}} the conventional meta-analysis, depending on the response variable and on whether we controlled for the phylogeny of neighbour or focal species, which calls for special attention to control for species relatedness in this type of review. This study demonstrates the predominant detrimental impact of alien plants on pollination and reproduction of natives, and highlights the importance of phenotypic similarity to the outcome of the interaction. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.

40|$|Social {{species that}} {{maintain}} individualised relationships with certain others despite continuous changes in age, reproductive status and dominance rank between group members {{ought to be}} capable of individual recognition. Tests of "true" individual recognition, where an individual recognises unique features of another, are rare, however. Often kinship and/or familiarity suffice to explain dyadic interactions. The complex relationships within a greylag goose flock suggest that {{they should be able to}} recognise individuals irrespective of familiarity or kinship. We tested whether six-week-old hand-raised greylags can discriminate between two of their siblings. We developed a new experimental protocol, in which geese were trained to associate social siblings with geometrical symbols. Subsequently, <b>focals</b> were presented with two geometrical symbols in the presence of a sibling associated with one of the symbols. Significant choice of the geometrical symbol associated with the target present indicated that <b>focals</b> were able to distinguish between individual targets. Greylag goslings successfully learned this association-discrimination task, regardless of genetic relatedness or sex of the sibling targets. Social relationships within a goose flock thus may indeed be based on recognition of unique features of individual conspecifics...|$|E
40|$|We {{aimed to}} develop a welfare {{protocol}} {{that can be easily}} applied by dairy goat farmers to evaluate and increase on-farm welfare, including a behavioural assessment by instantaneous scan sampling {{in a part of the}} herd. In order to obtain representative behavioural samples, an adequate sampling interval is needed. Appropriate intervals between two succeeding scans should not be too long to avoid wasting time and inaccurate results. On the other hand, time intervals should not be too short to avoid reduced observers’ alertness and reliability and to avoid dependence between successive data-points. Based on Engel (Behav. Proc. 38 : 11, 1996), fifteen goats were randomly selected in one farm. For 75 <b>focals</b> of 900 seconds with continuous scoring (on average each goat was scanned 5 times), a data entry was made every second on locomotor and ingestive behaviour states, consumed food type, environment manipulation and positive social behaviour. From this protocol several instantaneous pseudo-protocols were derived, each one with a longer sample interval than its predecessor. Spearman rank correlations were calculated to measure the association between the relative frequency of the behavioural pattern under investigation in the continuous protocol and the pseudo-protocol for all <b>focals.</b> The one-tailed runs test was used to determine the mean probability of sampling the behaviour statistically independent. The optimum sample interval was found by making a graph of both correlations and p-values in function of the time to decide on the ideal interval giving best association with the continuous protocol but keeping independence. The compromise for the optimal interval of locomotion was 29 seconds, for ingestion 35 seconds, consumed food type 46 seconds, manipulation of the environment 30 seconds and positive social behaviour 21 seconds.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that the productivity of sows housed in an Electronic Sow Feeding (ESF) system is affected by the housing management (static vs. dynamic), stage of gestation at mixing and parity. Familiarity has also been shown to affect the behaviour of group-housed sows. Thus, the objective of this experiment was to determine how the previously mentioned social factors affect the behaviour, physiology and productivity of sows housed in an ESF system. Sows were regrouped into either the static and dynamic pens. Within an introduction group, a subgroup of up to 24 <b>focals</b> sows was observed. The focal sows were chosen based on whether they were mixed pre vs. post-implantation (46 days post-breeding), familiar vs. unfamiliar with group mates and parity (1 st vs. 2 nd and 3 rd vs. 4 th +). Aggression at mixing and at the feeder, injury scores, feeder entry order, space usage, salivary cortisol and farrowing productivity was recorded. The data was analyzed using Proc-Mixed and the General Model for SAS. Housing did not {{have a significant effect on}} the any of the parameters examined. Young sows had significantly more piglets born alive when housed in a dynamic system, while old sows had more piglets born alive when housed in a static system (p= 0. 03).

40|$|International audienceMethods {{and results}} {{concerning}} the optical optimization of a linear Fresnel collector are presented. The variables {{considered in the}} optimization are the positions, widths and focal lengths of the mirrors; the mirrors can be of variable size and focal length, {{and they can be}} nonuniformly spaced. The target function to be optimized is the plant cost divided by the collected solar radiation in a year. The computation of the collected radiation and of its average on the year, and the optimization of the cost/radiation function are carried out via suitable mathematical methods and the choice of a plausible cost function. Four different levels of optimization (uniformly spaced identical mirrors; nonuniformly spaced identical mirrors; mirrors of the same width with uniform spacing and variable focal lengths; and finally a full optimization) are presented, with a discussion of the resulting gain on the target function (i. e. the reduction of the ratio between the plant cost and the collected radiation). The results show that the application of suitable optimization strategies can lead to an estimated gain around 12 % with respect to the initial configuration (all mirrors identical and adjacent), and that a full optimization leads to a gain of 4. 5 % over a simple uniform optimization. This gain is {{due in large part to}} the possibility of regulating the focal lengths (the optimization of <b>focals</b> leads to a 2. 8 % gain over the uniform case), while only a minor improvement (less than 0. 4 %) is obtained with nonuniformly spaced identical mirrors...|$|E
40|$|In {{behavioral}} research {{a variety}} of intervals is used when applying instantaneous scan sampling. To obtain an appropriate interval between two succeeding scans, time intervals should not be too long to avoid wasting time and inaccurate results. Adversely, time intervals should not be too short either, to avoid reduced observers alertness and reliability and to avoid dependence between successive data-points. Calculating mean bout lengths and standard deviations to determine the distribution of mean bout lengths is one solution. Another solution is suggested by Engel (1997) starting from a small continuously scored dataset. We used this method to evaluate the sample interval to score the activity budget and habitat use of two grazer species - Konik horses and Scottish Highland cattle - in a Belgian coastal dune reserve (see also Lamoot et al., 2004). For 127 <b>focals</b> of 900 seconds with continuous scoring, a data entry was made every second on ingestive and locomotory behaviour states, vegetation types of the area and consumed food type. From this continuous protocol a lot of instantaneous pseudo-protocols are derived, each one with a longer sample interval than its predecessor. The relative frequency of the behaviour pattern under investigation in the continuous protocol and every pseudo-protocol is computed and the dependence between each data point is calculated. The optimum sample interval is graphically derived from on the one hand, the association of pseudo-protocols with different intervals and the continuous protocol (Spearman rank correlation coefficients) {{and on the other}} hand, the mean probability of sampling the behaviour statistically independent. The compromise for the optimal intervals of all the scored behavioural states, vegetation and food types was on average 90 seconds. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background When mating effort (e. g. via ejaculates) is high, {{males are}} {{expected}} to strategically allocate their resources depending on the expected fitness gains from a given mating opportunity. One mechanism to achieve strategic mating is the Coolidge effect, where male sexual motivation declines across repeated encounters with a familiar partner, but resuscitates when encountering a novel female. Experimental tests of male mate choice via mechanisms such as the Coolidge effect, however, remain scarce. Moreover, it is untested to date whether the Coolidge effect occurs in a sex-specific manner in simultaneous hermaphrodites, where the motivation to mate with a familiar partner may vary with previous mating activity in the male or female role. Results We exposed focal hermaphroditic freshwater snails, Biomphalaria glabrata, repeatedly to either a familiar or a novel partner. None of our proxies of sexual motivation (remating likelihood, mating delay, copulation duration) varied between the novel and familiar partner treatments. Moreover, the mating role taken during the first copulation {{did not affect the}} subsequent choice of mating roles in the familiar partner treatment as would be expected if <b>focals</b> preferred to avoid mating twice in the same role with a familiar partner. This indicates the absence of sex-specific effects of partner novelty. Conclusion Our data indicate that mate novelty does affect neither overall sexual motivation nor the choice of mating roles in B. glabrata. Hence, male mate choice via a Coolidge effect appears inexistent in this invertebrate hermaphrodite. We discuss the possible roles of insufficient fitness gains for discriminatory behaviour in populations with frequent mate encounters as well as poor mate discrimination capacities. Our findings lend also no support to the novel prediction that sexual motivation in simultaneous hermaphrodites varies with the mating roles taken during previous copulations, calling for empirical investigation in further hermaphrodite systems. </p...|$|E
40|$|Nature reserve {{managers}} aim {{to evaluate}} the spatial position and presumed behavior {{of a group of}} introduced large herbivores by using telemetric data of one randomly selected individual. We hypothesized that dominance effects can cause variations in grazing patterns. A group of five Konik horses was observed during summer in a Belgian coastal dune reserve Westhoek-Zuid of 60 ha. All agonistic interactions were scored and the hierarchy was analyzed. For each horse 25 <b>focals</b> of 15 minutes were conducted to score behavior and position with 90 seconds intervals. The horses stayed predominantly in the dune-grassland (34, 10 %), in woody areas (25, 30 %), rough scrub areas (14, 20 %) and in rough grassland vegetation (11, 60 %). The horses foraged during 59, 85 %, rested (standing and lying) during 36, 80 % and moved only during 3, 35 % of their time budget. The horses diet was composed for 87. 73 % of grasses, i. e. 66. 90 % long grasses (average count: 96, SD= 39. 35) and 33. 10 % short grasses (average count: 47. 8, SD= 13. 44). Short grasses were rarer but they were most preferred and were consumed more frequently by higher ranking horses (rank-short grass intake: rs=- 0. 98), whereas long grass was consumed more by low ranking horses (rank-long grass intake: rs= 0. 94). This implies rank related monopolization of better quality grass when groups move in patchy landscapes. Often the poorer long-grassed vegetation types are targeted by nature managers, although these are least preferred by the animals. The choice of an adequate group size should be such that the low ranking animals are forced into eating the suboptimal vegetation, without harming their nutritional welfare. To evaluate the grazing behavior of a group of horses, the selection of both the lowest and highest ranking individual, will give a better view than the selection of a random animal. status: publishe...|$|E

S’ha destacat en la bibliografia que les oracions interrogatives del castellà i del català es comporten de manera ben diferent respecte a la inversió subjecte-verb: mentre aquelles permeten la inversió VS ‘clàssica’ i, en especial, l’ordre VSO, aquestes recorren sistemàticament a la dislocació a la dreta en tots els casos (V(O) #S). En aquest article revisem aquesta observació a partir d’un estudi de corpus i afegim a la descripció els trets prosòdics i pragmàtics de les interrogatives. Mostrem que les interrogatives del català afavoreixen la dislocació a la dreta, en clar contrast amb el castellà, que prefereix la realizació in situ del material del rerefons. Aquesta última opció té conseqüències importants per als contorns prosòdics de les interrogatives castellanes, que marquen els constituents <b>focals</b> finals amb un to ascendent i el material del rerefons amb una lleugera caiguda. It has been reported in the literature that interrogative sentences behave quite differently regarding subject-verb inversion in Spanish and Catalan: whereas the former allows ‘classical’ VS inversion, and particularly VSO, the latter systematically resorts to right-dislocation in all cases (V(O) #S). In this paper we scrutinize this observation from a corpus-based perspective, and including into the syntactic picture the prosodic and pragmatic features of interrogatives. We show that Catalan interrogatives clearly favor RD, in sharp contrast with Spanish, which favors in situ realization of background material. This latter option has important consequences for the prosodic patterns of Spanish interrogatives, which mark final focus constituents with a pitch rising and that final background material with a slight pitch fall...|$|E
40|$|Formation flying offers space-dependent {{disciplines}} such as astrophysics, astrodynamics, and geodesy, {{to name a}} few, {{the possibility}} of creating large spaceborne sensors from an array of small spacecraft flying in formation. This creates exciting scientific and technical opportunities as the formation could be arranged to work as, for example, an interferometer, thus providing a most unlimited angular resolution or a virtual telescope, thus unrestricted focal distances. Since the first mission including formation flying technology (EO- 1) was selected by NASA, some of the challenges to realize full Formation Flying (FF) capabilities has been {{thought to be the}} definition of suitable algorithms to navigate and control FF missions. The focus of this dissertation is the design and evaluation of algorithms for navigation and control for formation flying missions. Given its importance, extensive research has been already conducted to fulfill the increase of accuracy, autonomy, and other requirements of the Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) systems that derive from novel applications of formation flying missions. To centre the scope of present work, we have mainly focused in three of the present challenges: the difficulties of fusing different non-linear observations for relative navigation; the analysis and extension of behavioural algorithms for controlling a formation of spacecraft; and the design and validation of a control law for formation acquisition and formation keeping of a non-natural relative trajectory. These three interconnected topics cover a wide range of research in formation flying and embody the main algorithm components of formation flying algorithms from the observations to the navigation and to the control. The first challenge consisted, thus, in addressing the difficulties encountered by classical filters to estimate a state vector fusing common observations. We proposed several strategies to improve the robustness of these filters under non-linear conditions. Among these strategies, the modification of the residuals computation for the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) deserves special mention due to its excellent results and robustness against nonlinearities. A theoretical basis for these results became, thus, necessary regarding the new update equation of the UKF and has been developed subsequently in the frame of this thesis. This work has been published in Perea et al. (2007) and Perea and Elosegui (2008). The collective motion exhibited by some groups of animals has recently attracted the interest of many research groups who try {{to take advantage of the}} robustness and efficiency of natural patterns. With this aim, we have investigated the possibility of extending an interaction model that has shown emergent behaviour. In particular, the Cucker-Smale (CS) model has been extended for its application on spacecraft formation flying. Numerical simulations of the Darwin mission have proved that this strategy is suitable for loose formation keeping. Of special relevance is the low cost of the controller, specially compared to an alternative strategy, the Zero Relative Radial Acceleration Cones (ZRRAC). The problem of tight formation keeping is addressed previous publications. In these papers, we first study the relative dynamics of a virtual telescope that follows a non-natural relative trajectory driven by the position of an observed body and not by the natural forces in space. This analysis has originated the design of several controls based on different approximations of the relative dynamics. Their performances have been tested and compared through numerical simulations of the PROBA- 3 mission using, first, computer based simulations, and then, a realistic platform with GNSS hardware and operational flight software in the loop. The main conclusions show that simple control definitions, as defined by the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and Linear Quadratic Regulator with the Integral term (LQRI), can fulfill stringent requirements for formation acquisition and tight formation keeping.
