40|$|I {{started writing}} a Preface {{that became a}} study in a genre that {{is defined as the}} novel of <b>educational</b> <b>self-formation</b> {{together}} with the various other kinds of literature that this genre – the Bildungsroman – generated that focused on the question of self-transformation. It was evident that the Bildungsroman developed as a genre in the air of German idealism and in relation to the same philosophical concerns that informed the Humboldtian university. The specific form of the novel of <b>educational</b> <b>self-formation</b> was primarily a story of ethical self-constitution. Both and genre and the institution seemed to belong to the same universe. Today {{in many parts of the}} neoliberal world this ideal and sentiment – this vision of education – seems hopelessly quaint and out of place. Philosophy is no longer the centre of the institution and the humanities are rapidly shrinking. Subjects like theology and philology have mostly disappeared; the study of literature holds its ground but often given way to media or creative studies focused on web design.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I begin with Schleiermacher review {{and analyze the}} origins of the Humboldtian model of the modern German {{university}} as an influential kind of institution that was adopted in many parts of Europe, the US and beyond. The novel of education and of ethical self-formation came to provide a novelistic depicted of the essential human becoming of the hero protagonist and engendered a new genre that spread throughout the world. The paper asks the question where and what might be the novel of the neoliberal university in an age when the humanistic requirement has fallen away and students have become “customers” purchasing an educational service. Is there a novel of the neoliberal university that does not end- lessly replicate the logic of the marketplace but actually intervenes in material reality to “save” the institution?
