The only major {{change to the}} device between its {{announcement}} and being available to pre-order was the change {{of the behavior of}} the side switch to perform either sound muting or screen rotation locking (user selectable). The Wi-Fi version of the iPad went on sale in the United States on April 3, 2010. The Wi-Fi+3G version was released on April 30. 3G service in the United States is provided by AT and was initially sold with two prepaid contract-free <b>data</b> <b>plan</b> options: one for unlimited data and the other for 250MB per month at half the price. On June 2, 2010, AT announced that effective June 7 the unlimited plan would be replaced for new customers with a 2GB plan at slightly lower cost; existing customers would have the option to keep the unlimited plan. The plans are activated on the iPad itself and can be cancelled at any time.|$|E

[...] In May 2012, Matt Spaccarelli, a truck driver, won a small claims lawsuit against the company for slowing down his service. A Simi Valley, California judge awarded Spaccarelli $850, agreeing that [...] "unlimited" [...] service shouldn't be subject to slowdowns.

5000|$|On October 13, 2013, U.S. Cellular {{unveiled}} its take on Shared <b>Data</b> <b>plans.</b> The {{plans are}} comparable to other carriers Shared Data options, but still include all of the same free calling features. A further enhancement to the Shared <b>Data</b> <b>plans</b> was unveiled during Q2 2014, where customers could opt to purchase devices under no-interest [...] "installment agreements" [...] {{in lieu of a}} device subsidy. The installment plans are based on the full device cost spread out over 24 equal monthly installment payments, in addition to the cellular service cost. Customers who purchase equipment on installment plans receive discounts on their [...] "connection charges" [...] to their shared <b>data</b> <b>plans,</b> and pay lower activation fees on devices. There is also no penalty for early payoff for devices on installment plans. Customers who purchase devices under installment payments on shared <b>data</b> <b>plans</b> also have an [...] "early upgrade" [...] option to trade-in their devices after 18 payments in order to upgrade to a new device superseded by another installment agreement on the new device. In November, 2015, an enhancement was made to allow customers who purchase devices on installment plans to be able to [...] "pay down" [...] their devices in multiples of the device's monthly installment cost at any time. Thus, customers can now either pay off their devices in full at any time or make extra payments towards their devices.|$|R

Most presentations concerning data management {{do not provide}} practical {{advice on how to}} consult with researchers writing a <b>data</b> management <b>plan</b> for grant submission. This course teaches participants about the elements of a successful <b>data</b> management <b>plan,</b> and provides practice critiquing <b>data</b> management <b>plans</b> in a supportive learning environment where no grant funding is at stake. Join two experienced <b>data</b> management <b>plan</b> consultants with experience in liaison librarianship and information technology as they demonstrate how all librarians have the ability to successfully consult on <b>data</b> management <b>plan.</b> Each week will include assigned readings, a written lecture, discussion questions, weekly assignments, and live chats with the instructors. Participants will examine how data and metadata are defined, open data formats, dark archives, and secure repositories as well as addressing specialty concerns such as how securely preserve information related to at risk populations, etc. Selection of effective long term data preservation and sharing strategies will also be examined. Lastly, participants will evaluate sample <b>data</b> management <b>plans</b> from the sciences, social sciences, and the arts and humanities as a final project for the course. Critiques of each plan will be presented to the class during the final chat session {{at the end of the}} course. Learning Outcomes: List specific data depository resources in order to formulate recommendations for researchers to securely deposit and share their data. Learn about how different funding agencies, and departments within those agencies, have different requirements for <b>data</b> management <b>plans</b> in order to determine how to effectively advise each researcher according to the requirements for their specific <b>plan.</b> Analyze sample <b>data</b> management <b>plans</b> in order to develop an understanding of what constitutes a thorough <b>data</b> management <b>plan...</b>|$|R
