5|$|Octopussy and The Living Daylights (sometimes {{published}} as Octopussy) is the fourteenth and final James Bond book written by Ian Fleming <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bond</b> series. The {{book is a}} collection of short stories published posthumously in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape on 23 June 1966.|$|E
5|$|Continuation Bond author Raymond Benson sees Vivienne Michel as {{the best}} {{realised}} female characterisation undertaken by Fleming, partly because {{the story is told}} in the first person narrative. Academic Jeremy Black notes that Michel is the closest Fleming gets to kitchen sink realism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bond</b> canon: she has been a victim of life in the past, but is wilful and tough, too.|$|E
5|$|Covalent bonding {{takes place}} {{when one of}} the {{constituent}} atoms loses one or more electrons, with the other atom gaining the electrons, resulting in an electron cloud that is shared by the molecule as a whole. In both ionic and covalent bonding the location of the ions and electrons are constrained relative to each other, thereby resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> being characteristically brittle.|$|E

5|$|For {{the opening}} credits, Maurice Binder had {{disagreements}} with the producers {{and did not}} want to return. Designer Robert Brownjohn stepped into his place, and projected the credits on female dancers, inspired by constructivist artist László Moholy-Nagy projecting light onto clouds in the 1920s. Brownjohn's work started the tradition of scantily clad women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bond</b> films' title sequences.|$|E
5|$|His first {{business}} {{experience was}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> department of Continental Illinois National Bank, {{where he worked}} days while attending the Booth School of Business MBA program at night. He then moved to BancOhio National Bank, a regional bank in Columbus, Ohio, that was acquired in 1984 by National City Bank. Corzine worked at BancOhio until 1975 when he moved his family to New Jersey and {{was hired as a}} bond trader for Goldman Sachs.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is {{intermediate}} in reactivity between fluorine and bromine, {{and is one}} of {{the most}} reactive elements. Chlorine is a weaker oxidising agent than fluorine but a stronger one than bromine or iodine. This can be seen from the standard electrode potentials of the X2/X− couples (F, +2.866V; Cl, +1.395V; Br, +1.087V; I, +0.615V; At, approximately +0.3V). However, this trend is not shown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> energies because fluorine is singular due to its small size, low polarisability, and lack of low-lying d-orbitals available for bonding (which chlorine has). As another difference, chlorine has a significant chemistry in positive oxidation states while fluorine does not. Chlorination often leads to higher oxidation states than bromination or iodination but lower oxidation states to fluorination. Chlorine tends to react with compounds including M–M, M–H, or M–C bonds to form M–Cl bonds.|$|E

50|$|<b>In</b> {{all cases}} <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> is a {{covalent}} <b>bond.</b> <b>The</b> prefix dipolar, dative or coordinate merely serves {{to indicate the}} origin of <b>the</b> electrons used <b>in</b> creating <b>the</b> <b>bond.</b>|$|R
50|$|Imino acids {{are related}} to amino acids, which contain both amino (-NH2) and {{carboxyl}} (-COOH) functional groups, differing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bonding</b> to <b>the</b> nitrogen.|$|R
5|$|Despite Oklahoma's role in instigating the {{construction}} of the Kansas Turnpike, its plans for a connecting turnpike fell through. The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority (OTA) had not performed a traffic study, as KTA had, to prove that the proposed Oklahoma turnpike would be profitable. Oklahoma also suffered from a poorer credit rating than did Kansas. Additionally, by this time many states' turnpike authorities were competing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> markets for investor dollars. All of these issues combined made it difficult for OTA to issue bonds for its toll road. When funding had been obtained, political issues stalled the proposed toll road further.|$|E
5|$|From Russia, with Love {{received}} broadly positive reviews at {{the time}} of publication. The book's sales were boosted by an advertising campaign that played upon a visit by the British Prime Minister Anthony Eden to Fleming's Goldeneye estate, and the publication of an article in Life, which listed From Russia, with Love as one of US President John F. Kennedy's ten favourite books. The story was serialised in the Daily Express newspaper, first in an abridged, multi-part form and then as a comic strip. In 1963 it was adapted into the second film <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bond</b> series, starring Sean Connery.|$|E
5|$|The {{arsenal of}} weapons {{includes}} pistols, submachine guns, assault rifles, grenades, and throwing knives, among others. Guns have a finite magazine {{and must be}} reloaded after {{a certain number of}} shots, but the player may acquire and carry as many weapons as can be found in each mission. The player's initial weapon in most missions is James Bond's Walther PPK, called the PP7 special issue in-game. Most of the game's firearms are modelled on real-life counterparts (although their names are altered), while others are based on fictitious devices featured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bond</b> films, such as the Golden Gun and Moonraker laser. The weapons vary in characteristics such as rate of fire, degree of penetration, and type of ammunition used, and inflict different levels of damage depending on which body part they hit.|$|E

50|$|The {{symmetric}} combination (called a bonding orbital) {{is lower}} <b>in</b> energy than <b>the</b> basis orbitals, and the antisymmetric combination (called an antibonding orbital) is higher. Because the H2 molecule has two electrons, they can both go <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bonding</b> orbital, making <b>the</b> system lower <b>in</b> energy (and, hence, more stable) than two free hydrogen atoms. This {{is called a}} covalent <b>bond.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bond</b> order is equal to <b>the</b> number of <b>bonding</b> electrons minus <b>the</b> number of antibonding electrons, divided by 2. In this example, there are 2 electrons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bonding</b> orbital and none <b>in</b> <b>the</b> antibonding orbital; <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> order is 1, {{and there is a}} single <b>bond</b> between <b>the</b> two hydrogen atoms.|$|R

5|$|Filming {{took place}} at the {{floating}} opera stage at Bregenz, Austria, from 28 April – 9 May 2008. The sequence in which Bond stalks the villains during a performance of Tosca required 1,500 extras. The production used a large model of an eye, which Forster felt fitted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bond</b> style, and the opera itself has parallels to the film. A short driving sequence was filmed at the nearby Feldkirch, Vorarlberg. The crew returned to Italy from 13–17 May to shoot a (planned) car crash at the marble quarry in Carrara, and a recreation of the Palio di Siena at the Piazza del Campo in Siena. 1,000 extras were hired for a scene where Bond emerges from the Fonte Gaia. Originally, he would have emerged from the city's cisterns at Siena Cathedral, but this was thought disrespectful. By June the crew returned to Pinewood for four weeks, where new sets (including the interior of the hotel in the climax) were built. The wrap party was held on 21 June.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of an underwritten bond, the {{underwriters}} will charge a fee for underwriting. An alternative process for bond issuance, which is commonly used for smaller issues and avoids this cost, is the private placement bond. Bonds sold directly to buyers may not be tradeable <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> market.|$|E
25|$|The formal {{charge of}} an atom is {{computed}} as {{the difference between}} the number of valence electrons that a neutral atom would have and the number of electrons that belong to it in the Lewis structure. Electrons in covalent bonds are split equally between the atoms involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bond.</b> The total of the formal charges on an ion should be equal to the charge on the ion, and the total of the formal charges on a neutral molecule should be equal to zero.|$|E
30|$|A {{relation}} between adherend and adhesive material and consequently the load transfer of joint is intrinsically related to surface state. The correct preparation requires total {{removal of contaminants}} (remaining corrosion layers, dirt, lubricating and bio-organisms) is needed [3]. A strong adhesion depends on bonding surface treatment {{in order to improve}} a joint strength, although bond strength doesn’t increase with increase of roughening [4]. The surface roughness modifications <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bonded</b> area of <b>the</b> joint promote an expressive effect <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bonded</b> structures [5, 6].|$|R

25|$|As the Irish {{banks were}} unable to raise fresh capital <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> markets on the expiry of the one-year bank {{guarantee}} (see above), in September 2010 the government needed {{to provide them with}} further billions, amounting to a budget deficit of 32% of GDP. This led in turn to questions about the value of Irish government bonds, and they were re-rated to AA- on 6 October. From 21 November negotiations started with teams from the ECB and the IMF, resulting in an agreement on 28 November.|$|E
25|$|Plastocyanin {{is one of}} {{the family}} of blue copper {{proteins}} that are involved in electron transfer reactions. The copper-binding site is described as distorted trigonal pyramidal. The trigonal plane of the pyramidal base is composed of two nitrogen atoms (N1 and N2) from separate histidines and a sulfur (S1) from a cysteine. Sulfur (S2) from an axial methionine forms the apex. The distortion occurs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> lengths between the copper and sulfur ligands. The Cu−S1 contact is shorter (207pm) than Cu−S2 (282pm).|$|E
25|$|The {{importance}} of homing pigeons in the centuries before electronic communications, {{such as the}} telegraph and telephone, is seldom recognised. However the Reuters News Agency, the world's largest information provider, began as a pigeon service carrying closing stock prices between Belgium and Germany, basically between the western and eastern terminus of the telegraph in Europe. Also the use of homing pigeons by financier Nathan Rothschild to gain advance news of Napoleon's unexpected defeat at Waterloo {{is thought to have}} led to a fortune being made <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> market of the day.|$|E

The sources said that the 10-year tranche {{was expected to be}} priced at around 100125%, while the longer-dated tranche was expected to be sold at around 70.875%, the top end of the indicative yield range of 3.75 to 10.875%.|$|E
25|$|An entity whose income exceeds its {{expenditure}} can lend or {{invest the}} excess income to help that excess income produce more {{income in the}} future. Though on the other hand, an entity whose income is less than its expenditure can raise capital by borrowing or selling equity claims, decreasing its expenses, or increasing its income. The lender can find a borrower—a financial intermediary such as a bank—or buy notes or bonds (corporate bonds, government bonds, or mutual bonds) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> market. The lender receives interest, the borrower pays a higher interest than the lender receives, and the financial intermediary earns the difference for arranging the loan.|$|E
