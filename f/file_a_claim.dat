25|$|The state {{attorney}} general claimed that Coburn committed Medicaid fraud by not reporting the sterilization when he filed a claim for the emergency surgery. Medicaid did not reimburse doctors for sterilization procedures for patients under 21 {{and according to the}} attorney general, Coburn would not have been reimbursed at all had he not withheld this information. Coburn says since he did not <b>file</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> for the sterilization, no fraud was committed. No charges were filed against Coburn for this claim.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, President Barack Obama {{signed the}} Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. This law {{extended}} {{the statute of}} limitations on cases where a worker found that they were receiving discriminatory pay, allowing them to sue and receive recompense more than six months after they received the pay. This was seen as a victory for those fighting against the gender wage gap, because if a woman {{at the end of her}} career found that she had been making less money than men who were doing the same work, she now had more than six months from the date of her last pay check to <b>file</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> and possibly receive the wages that were denied.|$|E

[...] Nearly 26 years later, approximately 13,000 to 15,000 eligible property owners could receive monetary payments for damages and decreased property values. [...] Property and homeowners who owned property on June 7, 1989, the day the FBI raided the plant, are eligible to <b>file</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> for property devaluation.

500|$|Until it {{was given}} a {{permanent}} name, the Caltech discovery team used the nickname [...] "Santa" [...] among themselves, because they had discovered Haumea on December 28, 2004, just after Christmas. The Spanish team {{were the first to}} <b>file</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> for discovery to the Minor Planet Center, in July 2005. On July 29, 2005, Haumea was given the provisional designation 2003 EL61, based on the date of the Spanish discovery image.

500|$|On January 23, 2006, the Astros {{indicated}} that they would <b>file</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> on an insurance policy on Bagwell's health to collect approximately $15.6 million of the $17 million in salary owed to him for the 2006 season. [...] Days earlier, orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews had performed a physical examination on Bagwell and determined that he had become [...] "completely disabled" [...] in terms of ability to play baseball again, including a maximum ability to throw a baseball [...] for short distances. [...] Because of the language of the policy, the Astros could not release him without losing their settlement, nor could he take the field. [...] The decision effectively eliminated his chances of playing again in the Major Leagues. [...] On March 28, Cigna rejected the claim, contending that because Bagwell had played during 2005 World Series he could not have become more disabled during the period of baseball inactivity characteristic of the offseason.|$|E

500|$|After a party Aden attends {{with his}} classmate Matilda Hunter (Indiana Evans), Cassie drives them home. She {{is under the}} {{influence}} of alcohol, and when Aden becomes high on marijuana and taunts her, she crashes. Aden sustains a leg injury that ends his chance of becoming a professional footballer. When Geoff refuses the chance to take up professional football, Aden intensifies his bullying of him. In return, Geoff punches Aden and knocks him out. Aden later helps an inebriated Annie, who has had her drink spiked. [...] Tony and Geoff presume that Aden was responsible as he was previously involved in similar prank with Tamsyn Armstrong (Gabrielle Scollay), and Annie lies to get Aden into trouble. The rest of the town believe he is to blame, so he seeks help from local lawyer Morag. Annie's guardian Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) hits Aden and injures his bad leg, which prompts him to <b>file</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> against her. Annie admits that she lied, hoping that Aden will drop the lawsuit, but he refuses. He speaks to a journalist about Irene, which annoys Belle, Irene's lodger who is also a journalist. Belle writes an article of her own about Aden's war veteran grandfather, Stan, much to Aden's distress. He attacks Belle, sets fire to her article and cries.|$|E
500|$|Some further {{procedural}} {{reforms were}} {{undertaken in the}} 1850s. In 1850, {{a new set of}} Chancery orders were produced by the Lord Chancellor, allowing Masters to speed up cases in whatever way they chose and allowing plaintiffs to <b>file</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim,</b> rather than the more expensive and long-winded bill of complaint. The Suitors in Chancery Relief Act 1852 gave all court officials salaries, abolished the need to pay them fees and made it illegal for them to receive gratuities; it also removed more sinecure positions. The Master in Chancery Abolition Act 1852 abolished the Masters in Chancery, allowing all cases to be heard directly by judges instead of bounced back-and-forth between judges and Masters. As a result of these reforms the court became far more efficient, and the backlog decreased; in the 1860s an average of 3,207 cases were submitted each year, while the Court heard and dismissed 3,833, many of them from the previous backlog. Much of this work was carried out by the growing number of clerks, however, and members of the legal profession became concerned about the [...] "famine" [...] of equity judges. Despite these reforms, it was still possible for Charles Dickens, writing in 1853 in the preface to his novel Bleak House, to bemoan the inefficiencies of the Court of Chancery. His novel revolves around a fictional long-running Chancery case, Jarndyce and Jarndyce. He observed that {{at the time he was}} writing there was a case before the Chancery court [...] "which was commenced nearly twenty years ago... and which is (I am assured) no nearer to its termination now than when it was begun". He concluded that [...] "If I wanted other authorities for Jarndyce and Jarndyce, I could rain them on these pages, to the shame of a parsimonious public".|$|E
2500|$|All {{water rights}} claims {{will also be}} filed in a {{centralized}} repository, with county-level claims filed locally in each county courthouse. The DNRC continues to process new applications for water rights, and occasionally makes changes to existing rights claims. To <b>file</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> for surface water requires the submission of an application to the DNRC. No permit is needed to use groundwater so long as no more than [...] of water per minute are used, and less than [...] per year are withdrawn. Groundwater consumption over these limits requires a permit from the DNRC.|$|E

2500|$|Organized crime rings {{can also}} be {{involved}} in auto-insurance fraud, sometimes carrying out schemes that are very complex. An example of one such ploy is given by Ken Dornstein, author of [...] In this scheme, known as a “swoop-and-squat,” one or more drivers in “swoop” cars force an unsuspecting driver into position behind a “squat” car. This squat car, which is usually filled with several passengers, then slows abruptly, forcing {{the driver of the}} chosen car to collide with the squat car. [...] The passengers in the squat car then <b>file</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> with the other driver’s insurance company. [...] This claim often includes bills for medical treatments that were not necessary or not received.|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Norton (Richard Gaines), the company's chief, {{believes}} the death was suicide, but Keyes scoffs at the idea, quoting statistics indicating the improbability of suicide by jumping off a slow-moving train, to Neff's hidden delight. Keyes does not suspect foul play at first, but his instincts, {{to which he}} refers as the [...] "little man", pointing to his stomach, starts nagging. He wonders why Dietrichson did not <b>file</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> for his broken leg, and deduces {{he did not know}} about the policy. Keyes tells Neff of his theory outside Neff's apartment, while Phyllis hides behind the door. Keyes soon concludes that Phyllis and some unknown accomplice murdered Dietrichson for the insurance money, but needs more proof.|$|E
2500|$|Insurance {{is just a}} risk {{transfer}} mechanism wherein the financial burden which may arise due to some fortuitous event is transferred to a bigger entity called an Insurance Company by way of paying premiums. This only reduces the financial burden and not the actual chances of happening of an event. Insurance is a risk for both the insurance company and the insured. [...] The insurance company understands the risk involved and will perform a risk assessment when writing the policy. [...] As a result, the premiums may go up if they determine that the policyholder will <b>file</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim.</b> [...] If a person is financially stable and plans for life's unexpected events, {{they may be able}} to go without insurance. [...] However, they must have enough to cover a total and complete loss of employment and of their possessions. [...] Some states will accept a surety bond, a government bond, or even making a cash deposit with the state.|$|E

2500|$|In June 2010, after {{a meeting}} in the White House between President Barack Obama and BP executives, the {{president}} announced that BP would pay $20 billion into a trust fund {{that will be used}} to compensate victims of the oil spill. The fund would not supersede individual or state's rights for future claims. BP also set aside $100 million to compensate oil workers who lost their jobs because of the spill. The fund, known as the Gulf Coast Claims Facility (GCCF), was administered by attorney Kenneth Feinberg until it was succeeded by a court supervised settlement program in June 2012. In January 2014, a panel of the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected an effort by BP to curb payment of what BP claimed to be [...] "fictitious" [...] and [...] "absurd" [...] claims to the settlement fund for businesses and persons affected by the oil spill. BP said administration of the settlement fund was marred by the fact that people without actual damages could <b>file</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim.</b> The court ruled that BP hadn't explained [...] "how this court or the district court should identify or even discern the existence of 'claimants that have suffered no cognizable injury.'" ...|$|E
