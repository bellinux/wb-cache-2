40|$|In asthma the {{bronchial}} epithelium {{is highly}} abnormal, with various structural changes. As a consequence, the epithelium becomes {{an important source}} of inflammatory mediators that contribute to the ongoing inflammation and remodeling responses occurring in asthma. Compared with normal individuals, the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (NO) is elevated in patients with asthma, and these levels have been shown to vary with disease activity. Thus, in asthma, epithelial cells may be exposed to large amounts of NO. Increased NO production is associated with the formation of various nitrosating species capable of promoting DNA damage. In this study we investigated the effect of NO on DNA of rat trachea epithelial cells in {{the presence or absence of}} <b>flunisolide.</b> Rat airway epithelial cells were prepared and incubated with the NO donor S-nitroso-L-glutathione monoethyl ester (GSNO-MEE).

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the differences in nebulization of inhaled corticosterolds among four representative types of compressor/nebulizers. Methods: Twelve compressor/jet nebulizers from four commercial sources were studied (three for each type) : Clenny (MEDEL), Turbo Boy/LC Plus (PARI), Nebula Nuovo/MB 5 (MARKOS MEFAR) and Maxaer (ARTSANA) compressor/Sidestream (Medic-Aid Ltd.) nebulizer. We compared the required time for the treatment (nebulization time), output/minutes, compressor pressures, and aerosol characteristics of inhaled corticosteroids: Beclomethasone dipropionate, <b>Flunisolide,</b> Fluticasone propionate and Budesonide. Results: Nebulization Times showed a significant difference between nebulizer and inhaled corticosteroids for Clenny, Turbo Boy, and Maxaer. A considerable difference in the output of nebulized drugs was observed through the compressors/nebulizers. MMAD of all inhaled corticosteroids was significantly different among the four nebulizers.

In this work, the metabolism of four frequently prescribed inhaled GCs, triamcino-lone acetonide, <b>flunisolide,</b> budesonide, and fluticasone propionate, by the CYP 3 A family of enzymes was studied to identify differences in their rates of clearance and to identify their metabolites. Both interenzyme and interdrug variability in rates of metabolism an...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{primary goal}} of asthma {{management}} is the reduction of exacerbation risk. We assessed the occurrence of oral corticosteroid-requiring exacerbations (OCS exacerbations) with long-term fluticasone/formoterol therapy, and compared it with the occurrence of similar events reported with other inhaled corticosteroid/long acting β 2 -agonist (ICS/LABA) combinations. Methods: The occurrence of OCS exacerbations was assessed in two open-label trials of fixed-dose fluticasone/formoterol administered for between 26 to 60 weeks in adults and adolescents with asthma. The incidence of OCS exacerbations with fluticasone/formoterol was compared with those reported in three recent Cochrane meta-analyses of other ICS/LABAs. Results: The pooled incidence of OCS exacerbations with long-term fluticasone/formoterol was 2. 1 % (95 % CI: 1. 1, 3. 2 %, n/N = 16 / 752). In {{only two of the}} nineteen treatment arms summarized by Cochrane did OCS exacerbation incidence approximate that seen in the two fluticasone/formoterol trials (single-inhaler fluticasone/salmeterol [2. 9 %]; separate inhaler budesonide, beclometasone, or <b>flunisolide</b> plus formoterol [3. 4 %]). In Lasserson's review the pooled incidence of OCS exacerbations for single-inhaler combinations was 9. 5 % (95 % CI: 8. 4, 10. 6 %; n/N = 239 / 2516) for fluticasone/salmeterol, and 10. 6 % (95 % CI: 9. 3, 11. 8 %; n/N = 257 / 2433) for budesonide/formoterol. In Ducharme's and Chauhan's meta-analyses (primarily incorporating separate inhaler combinations [fluticasone, budesonide, beclometasone, or <b>flunisolide</b> plus salmeterol or formoterol]), the pooled incidences of OCS exacerbations were 16. 0 % (95 % CI: 14. 2, 17. 8 %, n/N = 258 / 1615) and 16. 7 % (95 % CI: 14. 9, 18. 5, n/N = 275 / 1643), respectively. Conclusions: The incidence of exacerbations in two fixed-dose fluticasone/formoterol studies was low and less than in the majority of comparable published studies involving other ICS/LABA combinations. This difference could not be readily explained by differences in features of the respective studies and {{may be related to the}} favorable pharmacological/mechanistic characteristics of the constituent components fluticasone and formoterol compared to other drugs in their respective classes...|$|E
40|$|Contemporary asthma {{management}} guidelines list inhaled corticosteroids as {{the preferred}} controller medication {{for patients with}} persistent asthma. Despite the availability of explicit guidelines, {{there is evidence that}} these agents are underused and that guidelines are not always adhered to. Fluticasone propionate is one of several inhaled corticosteroids used for the treatment of asthma. Like other agents of its class, its efficacy is backed by extensive clinical data. More recently, {{the quality of life of}} recipients of fluticasone propionate and its relative cost effectiveness have been investigated. A series of comparative analyses show that inhaled fluticasone propionate is more cost effective than oral zafirlukast and triamcinolone acetonide and slightly more cost effective than <b>flunisolide</b> in adult patients with asthma. Analyses used cost per symptom-free day and/or cost per successfully treated patient as outcome measures and were generally conducted from the perspective of the third-party payer. When administered at a microgram dose of half or less than budesonide (as is therapeutically appropriate), the cost effectiveness of fluticasone propionate was similar to or better than that of budesonide. In children, fluticasone propionate was more cost effective per treatment success compared with inhaled sodium cromoglycate. Quality-of-life assessments in patients with mild to moderate disease show that inhaled fluticasone propionate achieved improvements which were deemed to be clinically meaningful in patients with mild to moderate asthma; these changes were significantly greater than those achieved with oral zafirlukast, inhaled triamcinolone acetonide or placebo. Greater improvements were evident with inhaled fluticasone propionate in patients with severe disease. Conclusions: In addition to the considerable body of clinical evidence supporting the use of inhaled fluticasone propionate in patients with asthma, accumulating short term cost-effectiveness data also suggest that this agent can be administered for a similar or lower cost per outcome than other inhaled corticosteroids or oral zafirlukast. Importantly, the clinical benefits offered by fluticasone propionate in patients with persistent asthma are accompanied by clinically significant improvements in quality of life.

40|$|AbstractThere are {{significant}} differences in the pharmacokinetic properties of inhaled corticosteroids currently available for use in treatment of asthma and this can result in differences in pharmacodynamic activity. All currently used inhaled corticosteroids are rapidly cleared from the body, but show varying levels of oral bioavailability, with fluticasone propionate having the lowest. Following inhalation, there is also considerable variability in the rate of absorption from the lung, and pulmonary residence times are greatest for fluticasone propionate and triamcinolone acetonide, and shortest for budesonide and <b>flunisolide.</b> Cortisol suppression is frequently used as a surrogate market of systemic corticosteroid activity. Cortisol release displays a circadian rhythm, which can be mathematically modelled and the effects of exogenous corticosteroids on cortisol suppression established. However, when interpreting the effects of inhaled corticosteroids on cumulative cortisol suppression, it is important to take into consideration the pharmacokinetic properties of each particular drug, together with the study design and the time of administration...|$|E
40|$|The {{recognition}} that asthma {{has a large}} inflammatory component {{has led to the}} use of steroids in its treatment. The adverse systemic effects of the drugs have promoted the development of inhaled steroids with a high topical to systemic potency ratio. The 2 most widely used agents are beclomethasone dipropionate and budesonide. Budesonide has a longer plasma elimination half-life than beclomethasone dipropionate but a higher topical to systemic potency ratio. These agents {{have been shown to be}} equipotent with respect to their anti-asthma effects but budesonide may have a slightly more favourable adverse effect profile. At low dosages (up to 400 micrograms/day) these drugs are well tolerated. At higher dosages (> 1000 micrograms/day) adverse effects on bone metabolism and adrenal function have been noted. Other agents such a triamcinolone or <b>flunisolide</b> have no obvious advantages. We recommend that inhaled steroids should be prescribed at the lowest dose required to control symptoms, with the dose being increased or decreased in a stepwise manner in parallel with asthma severity...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Our {{research}} {{evaluates the}} efficacy of the inalation therapy by mineral sulphureous water in patients suffering from cronic bronchopneumopathy. Materials and Methods: From August to October 2002, two groups of patients, randomly selected, suffering from cronic bronchopneumonopathy, were studied at spa center "Pompeo" in Ferentino (FR). Every patient was treated daily during a cycle of twelve days. The first group was treated by pneumonic mechanical ventilation associated to sulphureous water aerosolinalation, the second by mechanical pulmonary ventilation associated to sulphureous water aerosol-inalation medicated with <b>flunisolide.</b> Every patient carried out spirometry, before and after treatment, and the measurement of FEV 1 was considered a good parameter to evaluate the respiratory function. Results: All patients reported an improvement in symptoms as dyspnea and cough. Results obtained show a significant functional improvement of respiratory function in both groups, evaluated by FEV 1. Equal efficacy treating the patients by medicated and not medicated treatments stress the therapeutic role of mineral sulphureous waters in chronic bronchopneumopathies. Our research points out the usefullness of pneumonic ventilation associated with sulphureous water aerosol-inalation in patients suffering from chronic bronchopneumopathies...|$|E
40|$|Mometasone furoate (MF) is {{a highly}} potent {{glucocorticoid}} used topically to treat inflammation in the lung, nose and on the skin. However, so far no information has been published on the human glucocorticoid receptor activity of the metabolites or degradation products of MF. We have now determined the relative receptor binding affinities of the known metabolite 6 β-OH MF and the degradation product 9, 11 -epoxy MF to understand their possible contribution to undesirable systemic side effects. In competition experiments with human lung glucocorticoid receptors we have determined the relative receptor affinities (RRA) of these substances with reference to dexamethasone (RRA = 100). We have discovered that 6 β-OH MF and 9, 11 -epoxy MF display RRAs of 206 ± 15 and 220 ± 22, respectively. This level of activity {{is similar to that}} of the clinically used inhaled corticosteroid <b>flunisolide</b> (RRA 180 ± 11). Furthermore we observed that 9, 11 -epoxy MF is a chemically reactive metabolite. In recovery experiments with human plasma and lung tissue we found a time dependent decrease in extractability of the compound. Hence, we provide data that might contribute to the understanding of the pharmacokinetics as well as the clinical effects of MF...|$|E
40|$|Background. Exhaled {{nitric oxide}} (FeNO) has been {{reported}} to be elevated in the oxidative stress involved in asthmatic patients, and the reaction of nitric oxide (NO) with superoxide anions results in the formation of nitrotyrosine. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effect of inhaled steroid treatment on nitrotyrosine levels collected by exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and on FeNO. Methods. This was a single-blind placebo-controlled study. The lung function, FeNO, and nitrotyrosine levels were evaluated in 10 asthmatic children. Results. The nitrotyrosine levels were stable during the placebo period (T 0 = 1. 16 ng/ml versus T 1 = 1. 05 ng/ml; NS.), whereas they decreased after the treatment with <b>flunisolide</b> (T 2 = 1. 14 ng/ml versus T 3 = 0. 88 ng/ml; P <. 001). No significant reduction in FeNO levels was observed after placebo treatment (T 0 = 38. 4 ppb versus T 1 = 34. 7 ppb, NS.). In contrast, FeNO values decreased significantly being at T 3 = 14. 9 ppb (T 1 versus T 3; P =. 024). Conclusions. This study shows that corticosteroid treatment reduces nitrotyrosine levels in EBC of asthmatic subjects...|$|E
40|$|Texto completo: acesso restrito. p. 128 – 146 A new {{approach}} is proposed to select operating temperature and pressure for supercritical antisolvent particle precipitation based on solubility parameter calculated by group contribution methods and using only the critical {{properties of the}} solvent. Solubility parameters are also used to choose the most suitable organic solvent for a given application. Supercritical antisolvent precipitation operating conditions of 36 systems are investigated including 8 organic solvents (methanol, ethanol, acetone, DMSO, DCM, chloroform, NMP and acetic acid) and 6 solid solutes (atenolol, tartaric acid, <b>flunisolide,</b> paracetamol, amoxicillin and cholesterol) in the temperature and pressure ranges of 25 ⿿ 85 °C and 50 ⿿ 250 bar. The results show a good agreement between the experimental and calculated data for these systems. Although particle precipitation depends on several parameters such as mass-transfer rates and hydrodynamics, {{the focus of this}} work is on the role of thermodynamics to indicate the preliminary conditions for a successful antisolvent precipitation process. Validation and results of this {{new approach}} suggest that it can be a useful tool for a qualitative and completely predictive evaluation of supercritical antisolvent particle precipitation in a cheaper way than carrying out experimental runs...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{the thesis}} was to explore the {{potential}} of supercritical fluid (SF) techniques {{in the field of}} drug delivery. In particular, the relatively recently developed solution-enhanced dispersion by supercritical fluids (SEDS) technology has been employed in the preparation of particles/powders. The manufacturing, stability and bioavailability of a dosage form strongly depend on the physicochemical properties of the formulation particles. For example, dry powder inhalation (DPI) for administering drugs to the respiratory tract require particles in a narrow size range (1 - 5 μm) to be effective. The identification of polymorphs and control of purity are also important issues since the physicochemical properties and therapeutic effects of the alternative forms of a drug may differ substantially. Solvent-based traditional crystallisation processes provide the product that may require further down-stream processing to obtain particles for advanced drug delivery applications. This can result in unwanted changes in the physicochemical properties of the particles and thus affect the performance of the dosage form. SF processing has addressed many of the challenges in particle formation research. Among several SF technologies developed for particle processing over the last decade, the SEDS process with its specially designed co-axial nozzle with mixing chamber has resulted in improved control over the particle formation process. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) was used as the SF, because it has low critical points and is non-toxic, non-flammable and relatively inexpensive. The initial part of the thesis concerns the formation of particles of model drugs such as hydrocortisone, budesonide and <b>flunisolide</b> using SEDS technology and the determination of the influence of processing conditions and solvents on particle characteristics such as size, shape and crystal structure. Particles of model drugs of differing shapes in a size range suitable for inhalation delivery were prepared. In the process, two new polymorphic forms of <b>flunisolide</b> were identified. This was the first report of SEDS technology being shown as a polymorph-screening tool. The remainder of the thesis deals with the development of SEDS technology for precipitating therapeutic proteins such as recombinant human growth hormone (hGH) from aqueous solutions. Powders of hGH were precipitated using SEDS without significant changes in the chemical or physical stability of the protein. The addition of sucrose to hGH in the feed solution promoted precipitation and minimised the detrimental effects of the solvent and/or the process on the physical aggregation of the protein. In conclusion, this thesis highlights the applicability of the SEDS process in drug delivery research and advances general understanding of the particle formation phenomenon. The SEDS process may also prove to be a potential alternative technology for the precipitation of stable powders of therapeutic proteins...|$|E
