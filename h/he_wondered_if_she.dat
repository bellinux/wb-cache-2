Nam says he has quit directing.|$|R

If the patient is up and about, she mystifies him; he is apt to make mistakes; he loses interest; <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> couldn't come to him, instead of his having to go to her; but when he finds the ailing person in bed, the case is natural and straightforward; he feels at home, and knows how to go to work. If you believe in a doctor, you ought to make him believe in you. And if you are in bed, he will believe in you, and if you are out of it, he is apt not to. More than that, Mrs. Tolbridge, there is no greater compliment that you can pay to a physician you have sent for, than to have him find you in bed." ...|$|R

5000|$|On their face, {{the lyrics}} of [...] "Harmony" [...] are {{addressed}} a lover who has returned to him after a long absence. [...] <b>He</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> only returned {{to him because he}} is the only friend she has left, but expresses his love regardless. [...] Although the lyrics are optimistic, James Perone points out that aspects of the music, such as a modulation to a minor key suggest that the singer's happiness may only be temporary. [...] The Elton John Scrapbook author Mary Anne Cassata interprets the song as a [...] "two-minute forty-five second dirge of despair...that somehow soared with hope enough to make Brian Wilson proud." [...] Elton John biographer Elizabeth J. Rosenthal interprets the song more metaphorically. [...] Rosenthal views the song as being about John's [...] "love affair with music." [...] In this interpretation, John is expressing his devotion to harmony, and the [...] "luscious" [...] harmonies in the song are confirmation of this devotion. [...] The drawing out of the song's last note suggest to Rosenthal that John's relationship with music will last.|$|R

60|$|But all day as Serge worked he thought. And his {{thoughts}} were of Olga Ileyitch, the girl {{that he had}} seen with Kwartz, inspector of police. He wondered why she had killed Popoff, the inspector. <b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was dead. There seemed no justice in it.|$|E

However, doubts begin to circulate with Corvin as <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> is the killer when was she describing the murder to her psychoanalyst in detail before it actually took place. Could it be that someone has read her dream diary that she kept and modeled the killing on dream images she described in order to frame her for something she fantasized about? Corvin also wonders who the two hippies are that she claims to have witnessed her crime without intervening.|$|R

6000|$|This devotion on {{the part}} of a rich and busy woman was deeply revealing. The youth was being educated swiftly into new conceptions of human nature. His mother was neither {{beautiful}} nor wise nor witty. Why should she attract and hold a lady like Mrs. Joyce? <b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had been quite honest with him.
