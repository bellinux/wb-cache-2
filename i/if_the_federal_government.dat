Additionally, many in Congress argued that the plan was beyond the constitutional power of the new government. James Madison led the effort to block the provision and prevent the plan from gaining approval. Jefferson approved payment of the domestic and foreign debt at par, but not the assumption of state debts. After Hamilton and Jefferson reached the Compromise of 1790, Hamilton's assumption plan was adopted as the Funding Act of 1790.|$|E
50|$|In this essay, Hamilton {{argues that}} <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government's</b> powers of {{taxation}} {{were confined to}} certain objects, it would place strain on those objects, especially in times of great need. This, he says, is dangerous to the economy {{as well as the}} government's source of revenue. In the interest of revenue itself, the government would be prevented from exceeding limits on articles, as it would destroy the market for that article. He later argues against a proposal {{that there should be a}} representative from each class of the economy. He says that the economy is far too interconnected to necessitate such a system.|$|R

5|$|Districts {{established}} under U.S. {{federal guidelines}} generally {{begin the process}} of designation through a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The National Register is the official recognition by the U.S. government of cultural resources worthy of preservation. While designation through the National Register does offer a district or property some protections, it is only in cases where the threatening action involves the federal government. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> is not involved, then the listing on the National Register provides the site, property or district no protections. For example, if company A wants to tear down the hypothetical Smith House and company A is under contract with the state government of Illinois, then the federal designation would offer no protections. If, however, company A was under federal contract the Smith House would be protected. A federal designation is little more than recognition by the government that the resource is worthy of preservation.|$|E
25|$|The next day, the Arkansas Secession Convention {{convened in}} the State House in Little Rock. David Walker, who opposed secession, was elected president. The {{convention}} continued in session {{for two and}} a half weeks. Feeling ran high and many fiery speeches were made, but it soon became evident that a majority of the members did not think that the situation at that time called for secession. The convention voted down a resolution condemning Lincoln's inaugural address, and defeated a conditional ordinance of secession. The opinion seemed to prevail that Arkansas should secede only <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>government</b> made war on the Confederate States. Still hoping for a compromise settlement that would avoid war, the delegates agreed to go home until after the people had voted on the secession question at a special election to be held in August.|$|E

The way in which renewable energy sources are promoted under the Renewable Energy Sources Act is a pioneering approach that is unprecedented in Germany or any other country. However, this type of support for innovation cannot be continued indefi nitely, for <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government’s</b> target is of obtaining 30 per cent of electricity supplies from renewable sources by 2020, this form of support must be re-examined and further developed. Renewable sources of energy are important not purely for environmental reasons {{but also because they}} contribute to energy security. Nevertheless, {{it is important that the}} supply of energy be climate friendly, environment friendly and cost effective, not only in Germany but throughout the world...|$|R

500|$|Despite the {{prominent}} placement of Bouchard in the referendum campaign, Parizeau planned to retain all authority {{with regard to}} negotiations, and to appoint {{most members of the}} negotiation team if they were to occur. Parizeau also believed federalist Quebecers such as Chrétien and Charest would be quickly disregarded and replaced at negotiations by representatives from the other nine provinces. [...] <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>government</b> refused to negotiate, or if negotiations were to exceed October 30, 1996, Parizeau stated that he would proceed with a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI) for an independent Quebec pursuant to Section 26 of the Sovereignty Bill.|$|E

On January 7, 1861, he presented a resolution known as the Anti-Coercion Resolution, which rejected secession, but stated that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>government</b> used coercion toward the seceded states, Virginia would fight, which was duly adopted. However, when President Abraham Lincoln made his call for troops on April 15, 1861, he was [...] "from that time forth zealously active in all measures for the defence of his State." [...] The call for troops was precisely the scenario detailed in their Anti-Coercion Resolution and Virginia seceded.|$|E

[...] The central committee elected by the convention was too impatient to wait long. [...] In late December, the committee called for a March election for delegates to the Convention of 1833. [...] The second convention reiterated some of the previous concerns and took additional steps to declare Texas an independent state, further concerning Mexican authories, who feared this was a step towards Texas joining the United States.|$|E

Once Lincoln left Springfield on February 11, he gave speeches, stating in Indianapolis that it would not be coercing a state <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> insisted on retaining or retaking property that belonged to it. [...] This came as the United States Army still held Fort Sumter; the president-elect's words upset moderate southerners.

500|$|The {{danger is}} perhaps not great if the people of one State, through their legislature, decide that Lady Chatterley's Lover goes so far beyond the {{acceptable}} standards of candor {{that it will be}} deemed offensive and non-sellable, for the State next door is still free to make its own choice. At least we do not have one uniform standard. But the dangers to free thought and expression are truly great <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Government</b> imposes a blanket ban over the Nation on such a book. [...] The fact that the people of one State cannot read some of the works of D. H. Lawrence seems to me, if not wise or desirable, at least acceptable.

500|$|Economists {{from the}} University of Tennessee {{concluded}} {{that while there}} would be many desirable macroeconomic effects, adoption of a national retail sales tax would also have serious effects on {{state and local government}} finances. Economist Bruce Bartlett stated that if the states did not conform to the FairTax, they would have massive confusion and complication as to what is taxed by the state and what is taxed by the federal government. In addition, sales taxes have long exempted all but a few services because of the enormous difficulty in taxing intangibles—Bartlett suggests that the state may not have sufficient incentive to enforce the tax. University of Michigan economist Joel Slemrod argues that states would face significant issues in enforcing the tax. [...] "Even at an average rate of around five percent, state sales taxes are difficult to administer." [...] University of Virginia School of Law professor George Yin states that the FairTax could have evasion issues with export and import transactions. The President's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform reported that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> were to cease taxing income, states might choose to shift their revenue-raising to income. Absent the Internal Revenue Service, it would be more difficult for the states to maintain viable income tax systems.|$|E
50|$|Chief Justice Morrison Waite {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the Court. Justice Waite stated that the title held by the Stockbridge tribe was one of occupancy only, that the United States held the fee title to the land. Justice Waite noted that this had been decided in Johnson v. M'Intosh 50 years earlier, in 1823. The Indians were not allowed to cut and sell lumber under the legal principal of waste. If they were clearing land for agriculture, they could sell the lumber as an incidental byproduct of the improvement to the land. The sale must be incidental to <b>the</b> improvement, and <b>if</b> not, <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> may take legal action to recover the lumber.|$|R

500|$|The three coinage bills—Maine Centennial, Alabama Centennial, and Pilgrim Tercentenary—were {{considered}} {{in that order}} by the House of Representatives on April 21, 1920. As the Maine and Alabama pieces were considered, Ohio's Warren Gard asked {{a number of questions}} about various matters, including regarding the wisdom of having so many half dollar designs issued, though he did not object to the passage of either bill. After the Pilgrim bill came to the floor, Gard asked Walsh why the bill provided for 500,000 half dollars, so much more than for the state coins; Walsh responded that it was because the coin was for a 300th anniversary rather than just a 100th. [...] Gard followed up this point, asking {{if it had been a}} 400th anniversary, whether even more coins would be justified, and Walsh agreed. Both Walsh and Vestal were asked by Gard how many half dollars were in circulation, but neither legislator knew. Washington Representative John Franklin Miller asked whether the coin was to commemorate the original landing of the Pilgrims at Provincetown or their subsequent landing at Plymouth, but Walsh did not answer the question definitively. Congressman James W. Dunbar of Indiana noted that the price of silver had risen so high that the Mint might be out of pocket in striking the coins, and asked <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> would cover any losses; Vestal responded that Massachusetts would. Vestal then moved the committee amendment to reduce the authorized mintage from 500,000 to 300,000, attracting the attention of Gard, who asked the reason for the change and was told the original bill had a typographical error. Walsh had told the committee that he had selected the figure of 500,000 since the Pilgrim anniversary was more important than the Maine state centennial. Gard enquired if the amendment had been approved by the committee, and when he was told it had, asked if the Pilgrim half dollars would buy more than ordinary half dollars to which Walsh replied, [...] "why, I think very likely, especially on Cape Cod." [...] Gard indicated his hope that he could spend a few days there that summer, and Vestal stated that Gard would be welcome to obtain and spend half dollars in any of the three states celebrating anniversaries. The bill passed the House without recorded opposition.|$|E
