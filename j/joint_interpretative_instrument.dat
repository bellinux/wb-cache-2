This notion, whose implications Clavijero expressly develops, has a specific function in his works as an <b>interpretative</b> <b>instrument</b> for social reality. The notion of barbarianism is oriented, ultimately, towards promoting the human and cultural development of the Indians via education. Clavijero thus continues the Hispanic tradition of missiology and pedagogy in the New World, a tradition that began in the sixteenth century, and which contitutes one of the distinctive notes of Spanish domination in America...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to contribute to debates on trans-scale approaches, understood as an <b>interpretative</b> <b>instrument</b> of processes of capitalism development in their territorial dimension, considering the scale of transnational and supranational regionalism, from the geopolitics and geo-economics of natural resources. Resources are those involving agricultural production, land and water. Food security is considered strategic in the context of increased demand and limits on production. The thesis defended here is that, with regard to food security and essential resources for their security, land and water for food production in quantity and quality, one can see in South America a very preliminary movement to incorporate the topic on the political agenda, i. e. the theme is gaining relevance in national policies and the regional scenario as there is an increase in this debate at conferences and seminars, and an increase in specific discussions within regional organizations such as MERCOSUR and UNASUR, in hemispheric organizations such as the OAS, and in multilateral organizations such as the FAO...|$|R
40|$|The present paper aims at {{dealing with}} some issues of {{knowledge}} of the architectural heritage. Given {{the increasing use of}} the innovative technologies in the field of the cultural heritage it is important to focus on their usefulness and potentialities in order to the conservation project management. The role of the new survey techniques and the accurate representations of the dimensional, structural and material consistency of the historic buildings and their context is mandatory and can influence the restoration choices. Starting from a recent applied research concerning a significant and symbolic monument of Naples, Castel Nuovo, the paper intends to highlight not only the importance of the integration of the specialist surveys, but also the role of the critical interpretation. The results of the different disciplines involved in the knowledge process have to be evaluated critically in view of the conservation of the tangible and intangible values. Furthermore, catching the complexity of architecture of the past depends on the capacity to maintain a close and constant contactwith the building physicality and also on a complex methodology which is inclusive of new <b>interpretative</b> <b>instruments</b> which could increase a virtuous hermeneutic circle...|$|R
40|$|This thesis is, principally, a methodological {{experiment}} {{aimed at}} organising historical-archaeological information into a functional {{system that could}} be used on a vast scale in the field of planning. The methodological approach takes on a a multi-scalar temporal and spatial view, and conceives of the concept of scale as an <b>interpretative</b> <b>instrument</b> which also influences the results of the research. Moreover, the decision to construct a graphic synthesis of the vast collection of documents making up the heterogeneous base for the research is a consequence of the methodological approach. The material has been systemised into visual representations of anthropisation processes and so-called chronosystems, i. e. the formal and structural outcomes of territorialisation. The geographic area that has been selected for testing the model is situated in the north-west of Sardinia. The typical chronosystems of six chronological phases have been identified, and the time-period for the analysis starts off from the pre-historic age and goes on up until contemporary age, which is an unusually long scope. The application of this methodology represents a new approach to historic studies of contemporary landscape. The research has been influenced by different factors and conditions, such as the phenomenon of continuous construction and settlement in the area and the various historic, structural, functional and symbolic tendencies affecting the relation between the city and the territory...|$|R
40|$|The {{intention}} of my thesis Hopscotch by Cortázar - {{a game in}} many games was to analyze the novel in its ludic dimension. I tried to see the game as a multiplicative element and, at the same time, as an element that provides unit to the work. Therefore, I use as an <b>interpretative</b> <b>instrument</b> the semantic gesture of Jan Mukařovský. However, I {{do not intend to}} utilize this term in his whole meaning, I wanted to study the multiplicity and unit of the game, exploring some of the aspects of the semantic gesture. Despite the game has dynamic features, it also has two concrete forms in the novel. Hopscotch is many games, but especially is two: esthetic and moral game. When I speak about the esthetic game, I refer to the formal aspects of the novel. I tried to study the esthetic game in its multiplicative dimension, as well as an element that creates unit in the dynamics of the novel. Therefore, I my research went through the formal aspects of the work. I observed the problem of the name, genre, structure and the relations between characters, readers and the author. On one hand, the novel is presented, thanks to the game, as an open, infinite book. The ludic element also provides to the author an instrument to play with the structure of the novel, creating infinite possibilities of lecture. At the third [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{the debate}} on new {{measures}} of wellbeing reached a wide audience especially thanks to the big media’s “ballyhoo”. That debate, very often accompanied by Robert Kennedy’s word (March 18, 1968, speech at Kansas University) has been urged also thanks to many prestigious initiatives, like the commission appointed by French President in 2008 and now known through the chairs’ names (Stiglitz, Sen e Fitoussi). What is never said is that since many years, many researchers {{all over the world}} are continuously working on defining concepts and measures of wellbeing. Looking at this movement’s outputs allows us to realize that what is reasserted by the last initiatives can be considered, in many respects, neither really original nor avant-garde (Maggino & Ruviglioni, 2010). In many cases, the debate has been trivialized to the simple concern “what indicator can replace GDP?” As we will see, actually defining what a good society is, and consequently its observation and monitoring, should take into account two important and interrelated concepts: complexity and limit. Concepts of good society: classification attempts. During the history of political philosophy, since Aristotle, the conceptual approaches trying to define what is good society were and are many. It is quite impossible to examine all those definitions and this work has no intention to do that exhaustively. This work aims at providing anyone with <b>interpretative</b> <b>instruments</b> allowing us to orient ourselves among all the emerging proposals and to distinguish between serious and propagandistic ones...|$|R
40|$|The {{practice}} {{of international trade}} is specific and evolves rapidly in accordance with its needs. Today arbitration constitutes the usual way to settle disputes of international commerce. However, certain rules of arbitration {{do not seem to}} be adapted with this practice. The written form of the arbitration agreement as required by, inter alia, the New York Convention and the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration is one of them. First this thesis presents the rules of these two instruments. Then international trade's practice is examined, and especially the incorporation of arbitration clauses by reference and the use of electronic means to conclude such clauses. There is a noteworthy discrepancy between the rules and reality of trade. Having exposed the various difficulties, this thesis examines national laws and case law in order to determine whether they offer satisfactory solutions. Different interesting answers have been brought in Civil Law as well as Common Law countries. Yet they remain local and do not allow for harmonization worldwide. They even often vary one from another and are sometimes contradictory. A more satisfactory solution could be found on the international level, and more specifically by the UNCITRAL. Indeed the Commission entrusted the Working Group II the mission of proposing a solution. A proposal of compromise has been drafted, namely, a revised article of the Model Law and an <b>interpretative</b> <b>instrument</b> of the New York Convention. This soft proposal is interesting but will perhaps not be able to settle all the problems related to the issue of the arbitration clause's form...|$|R

The interesting point here is that one single repertoire is played in different ways, on different instruments. This peculiarity in the history of interpretation provides an unique opportunity to study the effects of various constraints on musical performance. According to K. Newell's (1986) definition of action as emerging from the interaction between organism, environment and task, music performance may be viewed as resulting from the interplay between performer, <b>interpretative</b> tradition, <b>instrument</b> and musical work. This unique situation is also a way to assess the lag between musical plans (projects) and their performance (achievement) ...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{the study}} was to {{consider}} how parents' experiences of bringing up a child with autism might inform professional practice and provision. The enquiry investigated how mothers made sense of their experiences and the effects of bringing up their child, including their coping mechanisms and the arising key messages for practice. The study was based in a LA context and was carried out by a practising Educational Psychologist (EP). This research practitioner orientation required critical or action research elements to merge with interpretative method. Thus, initial contact was made with autism parent groups to ground the study in a local context and to develop research and interview questions. Critical action planning resulted from concerns arising from these groups. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with six mothers whose circumstances in bringing up their child had been particularly challenging. Their children attended both mainstream and special autism provision in the primary and secondary school sectors. The themes emerging from the powerful <b>joint</b> <b>interpretative</b> account of the mothers highlighted a deconstruction and reconstruction of self and expectations with unfulfilled wishes and control as key themes. Life impacts involved the child as central focus, an all-pervasive constant battle with self and others, including family, professionals and provision with associated child management issues being present. These key themes impacted on professional practice; and provision so that the importance of informed professional awareness, truly listening professionals, accepting school identity and service trust were highlighted. Professionals and parents should develop an understanding and acceptance of the child and each other, which still enables challenge and change. The position of fathers in family support needs further research and careful professional consideration. Professionals, including EPs, need to address the way they listen to parents. Some recommendations for all agencies and parents are provided which should lead us to a deeper understanding of humanity...|$|R

The argument that all future ESM bailouts should be individually {{approved by the}} German parliament was confirmed by the court. However, {{the court found that}} the argument that the treaty might permit the ESM to borrow funds directly from the ECB had no merit, as this was incompatible with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Finally, the court stipulated that Germany must attach an interpretative declaration to their instrument of ratification of the treaty declaring that their liability is limited to the €190 billion committed in the treaty unless an increase is approved by the German parliament, and that the confidentiality of information by the ESM will not prevent the German parliament from being informed on the workings of the ESM. Furthermore, the court stated that [...] "Germany must express that it does not wish to be bound by the ESM Treaty in its entirety, if the reservations made by it should prove to be ineffective." [...] On 27 September 2012, the eurozone countries adopted a <b>joint</b> <b>interpretative</b> declaration of the ESM treaty formalizing the [...] "German interpretation". [...] After a German court rejected a last minute appeal claiming that this declaration failed to satisfy the imposed requirements, Germany completed its ratification of the treaty. The court heard oral arguments on the merits of the case and the ECB's bond buying OMT program for countries exiting ESM financial support programs on 11-12 June 2013, with a final decision originally expected in the fall of 2013 but later pushed back to 2014.

40|$|Historiography {{has tended}} to neglect {{architecture}} in painting, or to envisage it as a lesser counterpart to built architecture and {{as a means to}} create pictorial space. This study seeks to redress the lack of research on architectural settings, arguing for the agency of fictive structures and proposing rhetorical theory and place, rather than space, as heuristic tools for their interpretation. It offers four main contributions to scholarship on Italian medieval and Renaissance painting. Firstly, it illustrates how fictive architecture creates place, constructs the narrative, and engages with the viewer. Secondly, it clarifies the relationship between place and architecture in painting by identifying and qualifying two main approaches to the representation of place: portrait of place and hybrid place. Thirdly, it explores the communicative capacity of fictive buildings, demonstrating the rhetorical power of the structures in Altichiero’s Oratory in Padua and Fra Angelico’s Chapel in the Vatican, and illustrating the potential of a rhetorical approach for the interpretation of architecture in painting. Fourthly, it contributes to bridging the historiographical gap between fourteenth and fifteenth-century art. The thesis opens with an analysis of how place was understood in fourteenth and fifteenth-century Italy, revealing the complexity and metaphorical valence of the word 'luogo' and underscoring the rhetorical nature of fictive architectural places. This study posits that rhetoric pervaded late medieval and Renaissance Italian culture, arguing that Trecento Padua and Quattrocento Rome were particularly receptive environments to rhetorical culture and deploying seven rhetorical terms as <b>interpretative</b> <b>instruments.</b> These seven rhetorical terms, selected from primary sources, clarify how artists created fictive architectural places, and help to scrutinise the possible meanings and messages that painted architectural place conveys. By emphasising the central role of architecture in painting, its crucial relationship with place-making, and its powers of persuasion, the thesis demonstrates the relevance of the architectural imagination of artists for a better understanding of painting, built structures and the articulation and perception of architectural identity in this period...|$|R

40|$|Recollecting Landscapes is a rephotograpic survey project which {{documents}} {{a century}} of landscape transformation in Belgium. It {{is based on the}} successive photography of 60 sites at three moments in time between 1904 and 2004. This paper takes the project as a starting point to investigate the use of new technologies for the communication of urban research. The project is marked by two ambitions: first, to analyze the transformation of urban and rural landscapes and second, to communicate this research to other scholars and to the general public. Recollecint Landscapes constructs a specific kind of knowledge {{in the form of a}} digital archive that is set up both as an <b>interpretative</b> <b>instrument</b> and as a didactic tool. An important evolution in the course of this project is the transition from print to pixel. The most recent rephotographic series resulted in a proliferation of media: a sourcebook, a multimedia exhibition, a documentary film and an interactive website with an on-line archive (www. recollectinglandscapes. be). Digital technology seems to expose the oscillation between document and discourse inherent to this kind of archival material. On the one hand, web-applications enhance the accuracy of information storage. Web-related databases are an aid to adding unambiguous metadata about the original context of images: year, place and date of production, photographer, institutional context, and so on. On the other hand, the availability of information on the web allows us to recontextualise images with an unprecedented ease. In the age of the internet, search engines such as Google Images have become an important source of information for students as well as scholars. Anyone can now produce an instant powerpoint presentation on any subject from behind their own desk. It goes without saying that in the limitless image archive of the internet, easy access prevails over accurate metadata. This evolution leads to one of the main questions behind this paper: how do we understand the impact of the new technologies on the perception and reproduction of the urban landscape? How do we prevent new technologies such as the web and powerpoint presentations from resulting in a mere rhetorical parade of images without context? More generally speaking: how do we deal with the issue of information control when images migrate from one discursive context to another? We argue that, because of the rise of new technologies such as the internet, the role of the researcher becomes comparable with that of an exhibition curator. Instead of offering one narrative that determines how the public looks at the photos, the researcher offers many layers of information: the researcher becomes a ‘curator of knowledge’. However, we also argue that, even when the web blurs the boundaries of traditional didactical spaces (such as the classroom, the archive and the exhibition space), these spaces can survive in new forms in the digital era...|$|R

Results show the interplay of doctor’s and patient’s different knowledge systems and classification practices, involved in defining what an illness is.

40|$|The formula Urban and Periurban Farming (UPF) {{has been}} chosen {{for its ability}} to {{summarize}} a number of sociotechnical features that detach these practices from the backdrop scenario of European agriculture, now broadly integrated in the global trends of large scale and/or mechanized agribusiness. Beside this, the growing awareness for sustainable agricultural practices is an attempt to reduce degradation of natural resources and to find environmentally compatible ways of increasing production and promoting certified bio-products. The intensification of agriculture activities, urban sprawl diffusion and land contamination levels requires a thorough knowledge of the soil as a resource and its close relationship with specific crop. Information on distribution, potential and constraints of major soils is needed, so that the most appropriate soil management systems can be designed. In addition, knowledge on land capability and suitability is also essential to determine the best land use for sustained crop production. New <b>interpretative</b> and methodological <b>instruments</b> are needed in order to further investigate various aspects of this phenomenon in a sustainability perspective...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is twofold: a) it {{stresses}} the concept of collective learning from a theoretical point of view, and provides new insights into its definition; b) it provides a measurement {{of the presence of}} collective learning in three Italian milieux. An analysis of the definitions provided so far in the litterature on collective learning shows in fact an ambiguity between these two concepts. A parallel analysis of the two concepts is run, and similarities and differences underlined. One of the main distinguishing features of collective learning is embedded in the element of "club externality", while the elements of "continuity" and "dynamic synergies" represent the elements of similarities with the concept of learning. The paper explains these concepts in depth, and once the "public" nature of collective learning is emphasised, it moves into the problem of whether the public nature guarantees its exploitation. To reply to this question, the paper moves into the problem of which local spatial preconditions have to be present in a territorial setting to exploit collective learning. In this respect, the paper provides a logic framework of preconditions for a territorial system to move from specialised areas, through to "local districts", "milieux" and "milieux innovateurs", and provides a distinction between the concept of "milieu" and that of a "milieu innovateur", which is so far remained ambigous. The logic framework allows in fact to distinguish in a clearcut way among all these concepts. These reflections lead to some interesting empirical questions which are investigated in the empirical part of the paper. In particular, the empirical analysis replies to the following questions: ? is it true that collective learning is not the result of a cooperative behaviour, but of a collective process; ? {{if it is true that}} collective learning is the way of achieving new creative resources for SMEs in local areas. The empirical analysis is based on three Italian high-tech milieux. Descriptive and <b>interpretative</b> statistical <b>instruments</b> are used in this part of the paper. ...|$|R
40|$|Articles 7 and 8 of the TRIPS Agreement are {{a set of}} treaty {{norms that}} provide express {{recognition}} for policy objectives that are fundamental to international intellectual property protection. Not only do they identify the goals of technological innovation and dissemination, they also acknowledge the wider public interest behind the Agreement. Given the content of Article 7 and 8, {{it is not surprising}} that these provisions are regarded as important interpretative devices that permit a contextual view of the TRIPS Agreement, such that Member States can tailor their intellectual property laws to suit national levels of development. Within the WTO, Articles 7 and 8 have acquired influence at the policy level through the Doha Ministerial Declaration and the Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health. Yet, these provisions have received only limited recognition from the Dispute Settlement Body. Hence the importance of the 2001 decision in US-s 2 JJ Omnibus Appropriations Act 1998, where the Panel identified Article 7 as an expression of the good faith principle. In this capacity, not only does Article 7 function as an interpretative device' also requires substantive compliance, operating as an effective source of law. Beyond the TRIPS Agreement Articles 7 and 8 have been utilised within the WIPO Development Agenda and the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement. This, together with increasing recognition at the domestic level, has resulted in an enhanced status within the wider policy arena and an enhanced legal status, such that the interpretation and application of Articles 7 and 8 is now beyond the exclusive control of the WTO. Consequently, as policy <b>instruments,</b> <b>interpretative</b> devices or substantive rules, Articles 7 and 8 defend a perspective on intellectual property regulation that is fully supportive of social as well as economic development in all participating nations whatever their stage of development.
