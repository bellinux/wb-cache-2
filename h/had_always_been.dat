5|$|A {{side effect}} of Baldwin's tour of Wales was the implied {{assertion}} of royal authority in a section of Henry's domains that <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> somewhat fractious.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Han dynasty, the Liu family associated its dynasty with the water phase as the previous Qin dynasty had done.

Yet by 26 CE (shortly after the downfall of Wang Mang) the new Eastern Han court made a retrospective argument that Han's element <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> fire.|$|E

5|$|Lo Pui Sang v. Mamata Kapildev Dave (2008) took {{a narrow}} {{approach}} to the reading of personal liberty in Article 9(1).
