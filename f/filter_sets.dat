5000|$|Internally, the VL3 {{marked a}} return to the {{original}} idea of using twisting dichroic filters, to gradually vary the colour of the beam (see US Patent 4602321). This was made practical by the simpler optics employed in a wash luminaire, which do not produce the same beam artifacts that the optics of a spot luminaire would, using this type of colour change mechanism. The subtractive, CMY (Cyan Magenta Yellow) colour mixing system designed for the VL3, featured three sets of three dichroic filters, each set independently rotatable; with the cyan filters at the rear, closest to the lamp and the magenta filters to the front. In their [...] "open" [...] position, the filters sat edge-on to the axis of the light beam, so that only white light emerged. By rotating the <b>filter</b> <b>sets</b> into the path of the beam, a wide variety of colours could be created—from light pastel shades, to deep saturated hues.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{potential}} for widespread usage and the evolving needs of researchers, many different mutants of GFP have been engineered. The first major improvement was a single point mutation (S65T) reported in 1995 in Nature by Roger Tsien. This mutation dramatically improved the spectral characteristics of GFP, resulting in increased fluorescence, photostability, and a shift of the major excitation peak to 488 nm, with the peak emission kept at 509 nm. This matched the spectral characteristics of commonly available FITC <b>filter</b> <b>sets,</b> increasing the practicality of use by the general researcher. A 37 °C folding efficiency (F64L) point mutant to this scaffold, yielding enhanced GFP (EGFP), was discovered in 1995 by the laboratories of Thastrup and Falkow. EGFP allowed the practical use of GFPs in mammalian cells. EGFP has an extinction coefficient (denoted ε) of 55,000 M−1cm−1. The fluorescence quantum yield (QY) of EGFP is 0.60. The relative brightness, expressed as ε•QY, is 33,000 M−1cm−1.Superfolder GFP, a series of mutations that allow GFP to rapidly fold and mature even when fused to poorly folding peptides, was reported in 2006.|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{importance}} {{and complexity of the}} packet classification problem, a myriad of algorithms and resulting implementations exist. The performance and capacity of many algorithms and classification devices, including TCAMs, depend upon properties of the filter set and query patterns. Unlike microprocessors in the field of computer architecture, there are no standard performance evaluation tools or techniques available to evaluate packet classification algorithms and products. Network service providers are reluctant to distribute copies of real <b>filter</b> <b>sets</b> for security and confidentiality reasons, hence realistic test vectors are a scarce commodity. The small subset of the research community who obtain real <b>filter</b> <b>sets</b> either limit performance evaluation to the small sample space or employ ad hoc methods of modifying those <b>filter</b> <b>sets.</b> In response to this problem, we present ClassBench, a suite of tools for benchmarking packet classification algorithms and devices.

A concept that is widely rec-ognized as fundamental in the analysis is the structure tensor. It has, however, a fairly broad and unspecific meaning.

A new method for structure tensor estimation, which is a generalization of many of it’s predecessors, is presented. The method uses pairs of <b>filter</b> <b>sets</b> having Fourier directional responses in the form of monomials, one odd order set and one even order set. It is shown that such <b>filter</b> <b>sets</b> allow for a particularly simple way of attaining phase invariant, positive semi-definite, local structure tensor estimates.

40|$|The Panoramic Camera (PanCam) {{instrument}} will provide visible-near IR multispectral imaging of the ExoMars rover's surroundings to identify regions of interest within the nearby terrain. This multispectral capability is dependant upon the 12 preselected "geological" filters that are integrated into two wide-angle cameras. First devised by the Imager for Mars Pathfinder team to detect iron oxides, this baseline filter set has remained largely unchanged for subsequent missions (Mars Exploration Rovers, Beagle 2, Phoenix) despite the advancing {{knowledge of the}} mineralogical diversity on Mars. Therefore, the geological filters for the ExoMars PanCam will be redesigned to accommodate the astrobiology focus of ExoMars, where hydrated mineral terrains (evidence of past liquid water) will be priority targets. Here, we conduct an initial investigation into new filter wavelengths for the ExoMars PanCam and present results from tests performed on Mars analog rocks.
