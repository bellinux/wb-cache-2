The damping {{property of}} interface microstructure of MCrAlY coating was discussed, and the ANSYS finite element analysis method was {{used to analyze the}} σx and σy of <b>interface</b> <b>structure</b> of MCrAlY coating. The damping energy dissipation of “horizontal” <b>interface</b> <b>structure</b> and “vertical” <b>interface</b> <b>structure</b> was researched. The results have shown that, the damping of “vertical” <b>interface</b> <b>structure</b> was slightly higher than the damping of “horizontal” <b>interface</b> <b>structure</b> in the same bending vibration loading environment. The mechanical energy dissipation produced by APS coating structure and EB-PVD coating structure may be different. The slipping of interface between coating and substrate was dominated in the interface damping of APS coating, while in the interface damping of EB-PVD coating structure the both interface slip and crack extension contributed. Reasonable design “vertical” interface structural may be able to help mechanical energy dissipation in the bending vibration environment and improve damping performance...|$|E
