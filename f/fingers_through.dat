5|$|Writer Howard Gordon was {{inspired}} to write the episode after reading two articles involving suicides of servicemen in Haiti. The refugee plot was used due to the producers being unable to film in Haiti. Colonel Wharton was portrayed by Daniel Benzali, who later went on to star in the ABC series Murder One. While the producers agreed {{that he did not}} look like a military man, they felt he had the quality they were looking for in the role. For the sequence where a man emerges from Scully's hand and strangles her, a male actor pushed his gelatine covered <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> a mechanical hand. The episode started production in late December 1994, and after a Christmas break was completed in January 1995. The Haitian refugee camp was shot in a derelict building in a North Vancouver shipyard. Sump pumps had to be used on the graveyard of the episode's ending as it was shot during a particularly rainy January.|$|E
25|$|The Bonyu Bar (Mother’s Milk Bar), {{located in}} Tokyo’s {{entertainment}} and red-light district of Kabukicho, employs nursing women who provide customers with breast {{milk in a}} glass for 2,000 yen (about 15 euros) or directly from the nipple for 5000 yen (about 37.50 euros). In the latter case the women can run their <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> the customers' hair, coo and say their name as they suckle.|$|E
25|$|La risata (1911, The Laugh) is {{considered}} his first truly Futurist work. He had fully parted with Divisionism, and now {{focused on the}} sensations derived from his observation of modern life. Its public reception was quite negative, compared unfavorably with Three Women, and it was defaced by a visitor, running his <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> the still fresh paint. Subsequent criticism became more positive, with some considering the painting a response to Cubism. It was purchased by Albert Borchardt, a German collector who acquired 20 Futurist works exhibited in Berlin, including The Street Enters the House (1911) which depicts a woman on a balcony overlooking a busy street. Today the former also {{is owned by the}} Museum of Modern Art, and the latter by the Sprengel Museum in Hanover.|$|E

500|$|In February 1992, Al Rendon {{was hired}} by EMI Latin to take {{photographs}} for Entre a Mi Mundo. A previous photographer had taken some photos of the singer, which were not well received by the company, and Rendon was asked to do a [...] "quick session". Rendon rented a studio and hired John MacBurney—whom Abraham constany argued with—to do the makeup. MacBurney [...] "privately complained" [...] to EMI Latin that Abraham was difficult to deal with. Rendon and MacBurney, however, found Selena [...] "real easy to work with". Selena picked out the outfit for herself to wear in the cover picture; this outfit included a black top with a mesh see-through midriff, a long-sleeve black jacket with black-and-white striped long sleeves, a wide black leather belt, and tight black pants. She chose a pose where she runs her <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> her hair, a pose that Abraham was noticeably bothered with. In 1998, the outfit that she wore for the album cover was added to a museum that her family operates in Corpus Christi, Texas.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Call the Shots" [...] {{was directed by}} Sean de Sparengo, and filmed in October 2007 in Malibu, California, while Girls Aloud were filming The Passions of Girls Aloud. The video features the girls in purple dresses performing on Malibu Beach at night with flames and white fabric surrounding them. The girls are also shown in different locations with individual story lines. Cole is simply seen looking out of a sunny window. Walsh is {{sat in front of}} a mirror, putting on make-up; her fictional boyfriend comes to get her and they hug, though she appears to be sad. Coyle is seated on a couch, flipping through photographs featuring her and a man. She takes a lighter to the photos and sets them alight. Roberts is lying down by a swimming pool, running her <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> the water. A young man walks up to her with a bouquet of flowers and tosses them into the water. Harding watches her boyfriend in the shower and goes through his phone. The video premiered on 17 October 2007.|$|E
2500|$|In his summing up, the coroner, H.R. Oswald, {{stated that}} Kempton {{was in a}} {{depressed}} state and short of money, [...] "Her life was precarious, and {{she was one of}} those who tried to turn night into day". He doubted the evidence of Chang which contradicted that of Heinberg but thought there was insufficient evidence to bring a charge of manslaughter against Chang. After deliberating, the jury returned a verdict of suicide whilst temporarily insane, at which, according to the News of the World, [...] "Chang smiled broadly and quickly left the court. As he passed out, several well-dressed girls patted his shoulder, while one ran her <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> his hair".|$|E

2500|$|Consistently {{cited as}} one of football's meanest, toughest, and most feared players, Butkus was renown for his intimidating profile and style of play. He was known to snarl at the {{opposition}} prior to plays. Quarterbacks would complain of Butkus biting them in pileups. Lions tight end Charlie Sanders recalled Butkus poking him in the eyes with his <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> his face mask. He once intercepted a pass from Vikings quarterback Fran Tarkenton near the goal line, and instead of taking {{the ball into the}} end zone for an easy touchdown, he took aim at Tarkenton to run him over. When asked by a reporter if he was as the rumors suggested, he replied, [...] "I'm not so mean. I wouldn't ever go out to hurt anybody deliberately. Unless it was, you know, important—like a league game or something." ...|$|E
