40|$|AIM: To {{construct}} a vacA-knockout Helicobacter pylori mutant strain, whose only {{difference from the}} wild strain is its disrupted vacA gene. METHODS AND RESULTS: A clone containing kanamycin resistance gene used for homologous recombination was constructed in a directional cloning procedure into pBluescript II SK, and then transformed into vacA + H pylori by electroporation. Colonies growing on the selective media containing kanamycin were harvested for chromosomal DNA extraction, and the allelic exchange was determined by polymerase chain reactions and sequencing. Loss of vacuolating activity of the vacA-knockout strain was confirmed by examining the gastric cells co-cultured with cell-free supernatants from H pylori wild strain or the mutant.

Each BoNT {{consists of three}} domains that are essential for toxicity: the binding domain, the translocation domain, and the catalytic light-chain domain.

40|$|Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are {{involved}} in the regulation of distinct critical cellular processes. Ubiquitin C-terminal Hydrolase L 1 (UCH L 1) has been linked to several neurological diseases as well as human cancer, but the physiological targets and the regulation of UCH L 1 expression in vivo have been largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that UCH L 1 up-regulates b-catenin/TCF signaling: UCH L 1 forms endogenous complexes with b-catenin, stabilizes it and up-regulates b-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription. We also show that, reciprocally, b-catenin/TCF signaling up-regulates expression of endogenous UCH L 1 mRNA and protein. Moreover, using ChIP assay and <b>direct</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> we identify two TCF 4 -binding sites on the uch l 1 promoter that {{are involved}} in this regulation.

EMS and N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), which both act by <b>direct</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> inducing base substitutions or deletions, {{have been used}} with success in the closely related C. acetobutylicum ([Annous and Blaschek 1991]; Elkanouni et al.

However, both [Lemmel (1985]) and Syed et al. ([2008]) obtained C. acetobutylicum mutants with higher tolerance and productivity using EMS and reported that MNNG was a less effective mutagenic compound. Our success with increased tolerance towards crude glycerol and increased butanol productivity by EMS mutagenesis confirmed the efficiency of EMS for development of C. pasteurianum mutants. As the mutant strain was developed by chemical mutagenesis it will not be classified as a Gene Modified Organism (GMO) reducing the operating costs and safety precautions necessary to run a GMO-based production.|$|R

50|$|Site-directed {{mutagenesis}} can {{be useful}} for many different reasons. A single base pair replacement, could change a codon, and thus replace an amino acid in a protein. This is useful for studying the way certain proteins behave. It is also useful because enzymes can be purposefully manipulated by changing certain amino acids. If an amino acid is changed that is {{in close proximity to}} the active site, the kinetic parameters may change drastically, or the enzyme might behave in a different way. Another application of site <b>directed</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> is exchanging an amino acid residue far from the active site with a lysine residue or cysteine residue. These amino acids make it easier to covalently bond the enzyme to a solid surface, which allows for enzyme re-use and use of enzymes in continuous processes. Sometimes, amino acids with non-natural functional groups (such as ketones and azides) are added to proteins These additions may be for ease of bioconjugation, or to study the effects of amino acid changes on the form and function of the proteins. The coupling of site <b>directed</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> and PCR are being utilized to reduce interleukin-6 activity in cancerous cells.

40|$|Random {{insertion}} mutagenesis {{is a widely}} used technique for the identification of bacterial virulence genes. Most strategies for random mutagenesis involve cloning in Escherichia coli for passage of plasmids or for phenotypic selection. This can result in biased selection due to restriction or instability of the cloned DNA, or toxicity of the encoded products. We therefore created two mutant libraries in the human pathogen Helicobacter pylori using a simple, <b>direct</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> technique, which does not require E. coli as intermediate. H. pylori total DNA was digested, circularized and digested again with a frequently cutting restriction enzyme, and the resulting fragments were ligated to a kanamycin antibiotic resistance cassette. Subsequently, the ligation mixture was transformed into the parental H. pylori strain 1061. Insertion of the kanamycin cassette by double homologous recombination into the genome of H. pylori 1061 resulted in approximately 2500 kanamycin resistant colonies. Heterogeneity of kanamycin cassette insertion was confirmed by Southern blotting. The isolation of two independent H. pylori mutants defective in production of urease from this library underlines the potential of this mutagenesis strateg...|$|R

GTPCH 1 protein degradation {{has been reported in}} animal models of several diseases, including diabetes mellitus and hypertension. However, the molecular mechanisms by which GTPCH 1 is degraded remain uncharacterized. Here we report a novel non-covalent interaction between polyubiquitin and GTPCH 1 in vitro and in vivo. The non-covalent binding of GTPCH 1 to polyubiquitin via an ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD) results in ubiquitination and degradation. Ectopic expression of ubiquitin in cultured cells accelerated GTPCH 1 degradation. In cultured cells and in vitro assays, Lys 48 -linked ubiquitin chains, but not Lys 63 -linked chains, interacted with GTPCH 1 and targeted it for degradation. Consistently, proteasome inhibition attenuated GTPCH 1 degradation. Finally, <b>direct</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> of an isoleucine (Ile 131) in the hydrophobic patch of the GTPCH 1 UBD affected its ubiquitin binding and the enzyme stability.

40|$|Introduction Phospholipase Cb 1 (PLC-β 1) is a {{key player}} in the {{regulation}} of nuclear inositol lipid signaling and {{of a wide range of}} cellular functions, such as proliferation and differentiation (1, 2, 3). PLCb 1 signaling depends on the cleavage of phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate and the formation of the second messengers diacylglycerol and Inositol tris-phosphate which activate canonical protein kinase C (cPKC) isoforms. Here we describe a proteomic approach to find out a potential effector of nuclear PLC-b 1 dependent signaling during insulin stimulated myogenic differentiation. Methods Nuclear lysates obtained from insulin induced C 2 C 12 myoblasts were immunoprecipitated with anti-phospho-substrate cPKC antibody. Proteins, stained with Comassie blue, were excised, digested and subsequently analysed in LC-MS/MS. For peptide sequence searching, the mass spectra were processed and analyzed using the Mascot MS/MS ion search program with the NCBI database. Western blotting, GST-pull down and co-immunoprecipitation were performed to study the interaction between eEF 1 A 2 and cPKCs. Site <b>direct</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> was performed to confirm the phosphorylated motif recognized by the antibody. Immunofluorescence analysis, GFP-tagged eEF 1 A 2 vector and subcellular fractionation were performed to study nuclear localization and relative distribution of eEF 1 A 2. Results We have previously shown that PLC-β 1 is greatly increased at the nuclear level during insulin-induced myoblasts differentiation and that this nuclear localization is essential for induction of differentiation. Thus, nuclear proteins of insulin stimulated C 2 C 12 myoblasts, were immunoprecipitated with an anti-phospho-substrate cPKC antibody. After Electrophoretic gel separation of proteins immunoprecipitated, several molecules were identified by LC-MS/MS. Among these most relevant and unexpected was eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha 2 (eEF 1 A 2). We found that eEF 1 A 2 is phosphorylated by PKCb 1 and that these two molecules coimmunolocalized at the nucleolar level. eEF 1 A 2 could be phosphorylated in many sites among which both threonine and serine residues. By site <b>direct</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> we demonstrated that it is the serine residue of the motif recognized by the antibody that is specifically phosphorylated by PKCb 1. The silencing of PLCb 1 gives rise to a reduction of expression and phosphorylation levels of eEF 1 A 2 indicating this molecule as a target of nuclear PLCb 1 regulatory network during myoblasts differentiation...|$|R

This report describes a robust approach that includes in silico, in vitro and in cellulo experiments permitting an in-depth evaluation of the impact of G-quadruplexes as translational repressors. Sequences including potential G-quadruplexes were selected within nine distinct genes encoding proteins involved in various biological processes. Their abilities to fold into G-quadruplex structures in vitro were evaluated using circular dichroism, thermal denaturation and the novel use of in-line probing. Six sequences were observed to fold into G-quadruplex structures in vitro, all of which exhibited translational inhibition in cellulo when linked to a reporter gene. Sequence analysis, <b>direct</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> and subsequent experiments were performed in order to define the rules governing the folding of G-quadruplexes.

Recently, Cr(VI) {{was shown to}} induce intestinal tumors in mice; however, Cr(VI) elicited redox changes, cytotoxicity and hyperplasia – suggesting involvement of tissue injury rather than <b>direct</b> <b>mutagenesis.</b> Moreover, toxicogenomic analyses indicated limited evidence for DNA damage responses. Herein, we extend these toxicogenomic analyses by comparing the gene expression patterns elicited by Cr(VI) with those of four mutagenic and four nonmutagenic carcinogens. To date, toxicogenomic profiles for mutagenic and nonmutagenic duodenal carcinogens do not exist, thus duodenal gene changes in mice were compared to those elicited by hepatocarcinogens. Specifically, duodenal gene changes in mice following exposure to Cr(VI) in drinking water were compared to hepatic gene changes previously identified as potentially discriminating mutagenic and nonmutagenic hepatocarcinogens. Using multivariate statistical analyses (including logistic regression classification), the Cr(VI) gene responses clustered apart from mutagenic carcinogens and closely with nonmutagenic carcinogens.

40|$|The {{treatment}} of parvovirus H- 1, a single-stranded DNA virus, with ethylnitrosourea {{immediately prior to}} infection of human cells, resulted in both virus mutagenesis and lethality (immediate hits). The incubation of treated virus, prior to inoculation, under conditions promoting the release of alkylated bases, slightly reduced the mutagenicity of ethylnitrosourea but significantly increased its killing effect (delayed hits). In untreated cells, the appearance of one apurinic/apyrimidinic site in viral DNA correlated {{with the formation of}} approximately one delayed lethal hit per virus.

Second, a small amount of the single-strand-specific S 1 nuclease is used to nick the displaced DNA.
