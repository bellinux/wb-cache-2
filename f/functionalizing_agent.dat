30|$|For {{successful}} {{application of}} nano-antibiotic conjugation, apart from better delivery, their activities {{should be evaluated}} properly because the amount of antibiotics often given for therapy is much more higher than the dose required for killing the pathogens.

For a successful antibiotic therapy, the dose should be reduced to avoid their side effects {{at the same time}} the stability should be increased to make them more economic. With the advancement of nanotechnology, functionalized nanoparticles have been used to conjugate different drugs. Among the different nanoparticles, Gnps were found to be less toxic and hence widely used for this purpose. In most of the cases, the conjugation was done by functionalized gold particles, where amino acids, glutathione, polyethylene glycol etc were used as <b>functionalizing</b> <b>agents</b> [26].

For achieving this goal, the generation of a universally functionalizable primer coating in one-pot reaction and under relatively mild conditions is especially attractive due to its potential versatility and ease of application. The aim of the present work is to obtain such a functionalizable coating by a cross-linking reaction between pyrocatechol and hexamethylenediamine (HDMA) under oxidizing conditions.

To understand the success of NHCs, this review first presents the electronic properties of NHCs, their main synthetic methods, their handling, and their reactivity. Their ability to activate key functional groups (e. g. aldehydes, esters, heterocycles, silyl ketene acetals, alcohols) is then discussed in the context of molecular chemistry. Focus has been placed on the activation of substrates finding analogies with monomers (e. g. bis-aldehydes, multi-isocyanates, cyclic esters, epoxides, N-carboxyanhydrides, etc.) and/or initiators (e. g. hydroxy- or trimethylsilyl-containing reagents) employed in such "organopolymerisation" reactions utilizing NHCs. A variety of metal-free polymers, including aliphatic polyesters and polyethers, poly(alpha-peptoid) s, poly(meth) acrylates, polyurethanes, or polysiloxanes can be obtained in this way.

40|$|Poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate), PHB, is a polymer {{with broad}} {{potential}} applications {{because of its}} biodegradability and biocompatibility. However, its high crystallinity is a limiting factor for many applications. To overcome this drawback, one strategy currently employed involves {{the reduction of the}} molecular weight of PHB with the concomitant formation of end-functionalized chains, such as those obtained via glycolysis. The glycolysis of PHB can be catalyzed by acid, base, or organometallic compounds. However, to our knowledge, there are no reports regarding PHB glycolysis catalyzed enzymatically. Among the major types of enzymes used in biocatalysis, the lipases stand out because they have the ability to catalyze reactions in both aqueous and organic media.

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of the products showed characteristic signals for the terminal hydroxyl groups of the polyols, while thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry analyses confirmed an increase in the thermal stability and a decrease in the crystallinity of the polyols compared with the starting PHB polymer, which were both attributed to the reduction in the molecular weight due to glycolysis...|$|E

The chemical nature of the <b>functionalizing</b> <b>agent</b> on the formation of homogenous zeolite membrane was evaluated. One monomer and two cationic polymers were used: 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APS), polyethylenimine (PEI) and polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA). The support was subjected to chemical functionalization and then it was rubbed with zeolite crystals. The W zeolite was used as zeolite seed in two different Si/Al ratios. The functionalized and rubbed supports were submitted to hydrothermal treatment at 150  °C for 48  h. The bioactivity of the homogeneous zeolite membranes was evaluated by the biomimetic method through the membranes soaking in a simulated body fluid (SBF) at 37  °C for 21  days. Two immersion methods were evaluated. The products were characterized by XRD and SEM techniques. The results indicated that the supported functionalization with PDDA and the Si/Al ratio (higher than 1.8) of zeolite enhanced the interaction between the support and the zeolite precursor enhancing the formation of homogeneous zeolite membrane on the surface. The presence of the functional groups of PDDA on the membrane was detected by FTIR. After immersion in SBF, the zeolite membrane was stable and {{led to the formation of}} Ca–P layer on its surface.

Chemical {{changes on the}} surface of the graphene were studied using FTIR spectra. The thermal stability obtained from simultaneous TGA/DTG analyses showed various stability changes when compared with pristine and oxidized graphene. Raman spectroscopy and XRD results also identified chemical and structural changes. Different levels of reduction were achieved after DES treatment, and simultaneous functionalization/reduction was reported in some cases. Further investigations of the structural changes were performed using SEM, TEM, and particle size analyses. The dispersibility of the treated graphene also was assessed and characterized based on zeta potential values. The results provided convincing indication of the changes on surface chemistry that occurred after DES treatment. However, considerable improvements in the dispersion stability of the graphene/water systems were recorded for graphene treated with DES 5, 7, and 9 compared to graphene oxide. The introduction of new hydrophilic functional groups was responsible for this behavior. The different reducing abilities of the DESs used were responsible for the different levels of agglomeration during the dispersibility tests. However, each modification process was an independent case that could be interpreted based on various aspects. The as-functionalized graphene may have different electrical, mechanical, or optical properties than the original pristine graphene. Thus, it is important to extend this study and test the functionalized graphene in various potential applications.|$|R
40|$|The use of polymer nanocomposites in {{electrical}} insulation is {{claimed to be}} capable of enhancing the dielectric performance of insulation systems. This is believed {{to be related to the}} much smaller size of the filler particles, which leads to the presence of extensive interfacial areas. In this regard, nanocomposites are expected to possess unique dielectric properties that reflect the resulting interphase regions. Since the surface state of the nanofiller is closely related to the interphase regions, surface functionalization of the nanofiller has been shown by many workers to be an important factor in determining the nanocomposite’s interphase structure and, hence, the macroscopic physical properties of the system. While many comparisons of nanocomposites containing functionalized and unfunctionalized fillers have been reported, few systematic studies of this area have been undertaken with a view to understanding the mechanisms underpinning the concept of filler functionalization in nanodielectrics. In this paper, we begin to address this by using a series of <b>functionalizing</b> <b>agents,</b> which differ with respect to their aliphatic chain length; all systems were based upon trimethoxysilane and, in all cases, the nature of the thermodynamic interactions with the polyethylene matrix should be comparable.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane in wet natural gas over Mn 2 O 3 /SiO 2 catalyst was investigated by Ping et al. [30]. In {{most of the}} earlier reports the <b>functionalizing</b> <b>agent</b> is assembled after {{the formation of the}} silica shell, or a co-condensation method has been used. In our studies we have optimized the conditions such that the functionalized shell can be formed from the hydrolysis of the respective precursors, i.e., the organotrialkoxysilanes to form amino-, allyl-, and vinyl-functionalized silica shell. To {{the best of our knowledge}} there has been only one report on the formation of amino-functionalized silica shell over ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (USPIO) using the hydrolysis of the organosilane. These particles were coated with silica, (3 -aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (3 -APTMS), and [N-(2 -aminoethyl)- 3 -aminopropyl]trimethoxysilane (AEAPTMS), and their ability to label immortalize progenitor cells for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was compared. It was observed that the three coated USPIO particles were biocompatible and were intensely internalized in immortalized progenitor cells which make them a suitable candidate for MR cell-labeling and cell-tracking experiments [31]. Thus, we believe that our methodology will ensure more functional groups over the core-shell nanostructures and hence can be used for biological applications in a more efficient way. In this study we also show the ability of these nanostructures to immobilize glucose and L-methionine.|$|E
30|$|A {{tentative}} quantification of the aminopropyl {{groups is}} based on thermogravimetry (Figure 3 b) and the available surface area (0.96 m 2 /g) of the ZnO wires, as calculated by the BET model from nitrogen sorption measurements (as reported in Additional file 1 : Figure S 1). The weight loss of the functionalized sample is slightly higher {{with respect to the}} sample with unfunctionalized ZnO, in particular, the first derivative of the thermogravimetric curve (DTG, red dot curve) shows a peak from 300 °C to 400 °C, indicative of the loss of organic materials. The weight loss in this temperature range can be generally attributed to the materials adsorbed or anchored to the ZnO surface, including the amine <b>functionalizing</b> <b>agent.</b> Calculation based on the weight loss of both samples returns a value of about 2 μmol/g of sample (0.37 mg/g) of organic material; thus, in absence of any contamination, one could assume this value as the maximum amount of aminopropyl group attached to the surface. By taking into account the value of specific surface area, the hypothetic maximum aminopropyl group density is about 0.38 mg/m 2 or 1.78 molecules/nm 2. From the thermogravimetric curve, we also calculated about 2.11 mg/g (2.19 mg/m 2) of hydroxyl groups on the bare ZnO surface (black curve), whereas after the functionalization with APTMS, the groups are reduced to 1.17 mg/g (1.22 mg/m 2). This decrease of hydroxyl group is clearly attributed to the effective anchoring of the aminopropyl groups to the ZnO surface, since an average of two/three methoxysilane ending groups of the APTMS molecule condense with the respective hydroxyl group on the ZnO surface during the functionalization reaction (Figure 1, left).|$|E

Using the combined reducing property of antibiotics and borohydride, antibiotics were conjugated with Gnps. The interaction between antibiotics and Gnps is likely to be mediated by the adsorption of the antibiotic molecules on the nanoparticle surfaces. The average particles size after conjugation were shown to decrease (Fig. 2 a). This was possibly again due to the combined reducing property of both antibiotics and borohydride in situ. However, the plasmon resonance study (Fig. 3) showed a red shift, indicating the presence of larger particles (Fig. 2 b), though they were less in number (Fig. 2 a). In case of Gnps conjugated ampicillin, the plasmon resonance showed a flatten plateau in the plasmon region due to the presence of such poly dispersed particles. The dynamic light scattering study (Fig. 2 b) and TEM study (Fig. 4 b) also supported the above statement. In one step further, we directly showed evidences by scanning electron microscopic studies that, all the three antibiotics formed some specific three-dimensional structures when conjugated with Gnps. Also, to prove the conjugation of antibiotics with Gnps, we found that after spinning down the Gnps conjugated antibiotics, the functional activity of the precipitate (pellet-suspension) was about 60 – 80 % and that of the supernatant was about 20 – 40 %. Thus, majority of the antibiotic molecules were associated with Gnps.|$|E
40|$|Water-soluble multiwalled carbon {{nanotubes}} (MWNTs) with temperature-responsive shells {{were successfully}} prepared by grafting poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) from the sidewalls of MWNTs, via surface reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization using RAFT <b>agent</b> <b>functionalized</b> MWNTs as the chain transfer agent. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements {{showed that the}} weight composition of the as-grown PNIPAM polymers on the MWNTs can be well controlled by the feed ratio (in weight) of NIPAM to RAFT <b>agent</b> <b>functionalized</b> MWNTs (MWNT-SC(S) Ph). The MWNT-g-PNIPAM has good solubility in water, chloroform, and tetrahydrofuran (THF). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images also showed that the MWNT-g-PNIPAM was dispersed individually and eventually bonded with the polymer layer by surface RAFT polymerization. The PNIPAM shell is very sensitive to a change of temperature. This method could find potential applications by grafting other functional polymer chains onto MWNTs...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a general {{protocol}} for the making of surface-imprinted core-shell nanoparticles via surface reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization using RAFT <b>agent</b> <b>functionalized</b> model silica nanoparticles as the chain-transfer agent. In this protocol, trichloro(4 -chloromethylphenyl) silane was immobilized {{on the surface of}} SiO 2 nanoparticles, forming chloromethylphenyl functionalized silica (silica-Cl). RAFT <b>agent</b> <b>functionalized</b> silica was subsequently produced by substitute reaction of silica-Cl with PhC(S) SMgBr. The grafting copolymerization of 4 -vinylpyridine and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate using surface RAFT polymerization and in the presence of 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid as the template {{led to the formation of}} surface-imprinted core-shell nanoparticles. The resulting surface-imprinted core-shell nanoparticles bind the original template 2, 4 -D with an appreciable selectivity over structurally related compounds. The potential use of the surface-imprinted core-shell nanoparticles as the recognition element in the competitive fluorescent binding assay for 2, 4 -D was also demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that pre-treatment (impregnation) of graphite anodes in a polyether <b>functionalized</b> disiloxane <b>agent</b> prevents graphite flake exfoliation and electrode degradation in Li-ion cells with electrolytes based on propylene carbonate (PC) as single electrolyte solvent. This beneficial effect has been evidenced to strongly depend on the concentration of the impregnation bath. For 100 % concentration (pure siloxane), SEM images do not exhibit visible signs of flake splitting and the corresponding galvanostatic charge/discharge curves exhibit conventional lithium intercalation behavior, with reversible capacity approaching 300 mAh g- 1. Post-mortem EDX analysis of cycled electrodes revealed the presence of silicon species in the passive layers on graphite. The proposed approach {{can be regarded as}} alternative for conventional exfoliation-suppressing methods relying on bulk electrolyte additives...|$|R
