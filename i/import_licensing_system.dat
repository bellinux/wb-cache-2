25|$|China {{has adopted}} a variety of {{measures}} to promote its foreign economic relations, maximizing the role of imports, exports, and foreign capital in economic development. Foreign trade organizations were reorganized, and control of imports and exports was relaxed or strengthened depending on the balance of trade {{and the level of}} foreign exchange reserves. Heavy purchases of foreign plants and equipment resulted in import restraint from 1980 to 1983. Because of the expansion of exports in the mid-1980s, a large foreign reserve surplus, and the decentralized management of foreign trade, imports surged. Huge, uncontrolled purchases of consumer goods led to trade deficits in 1984 and 1985, resulting in the introduction of an <b>import</b> and export <b>licensing</b> <b>system,</b> stricter controls on foreign exchange expenditures, and the devaluation of the yuan {{in order to reduce the}} trade deficit and ensure that machinery, equipment, and semi-finished goods, rather than consumer goods, were imported.

The four challengers assert the same basic allegation: That Argentina has used import licensing and registration requirements as an informal trade balancing program to favor domestic producers, withholding the licenses from importers unless they agree to certain export quotas. In March, 2012, 14 members of the WTO Council for Trade in Goods, including the U.S., EU and Mexico, said the regulations were creating long delays and resulting in huge costs {{for many of the}} companies doing business with Argentina.

5000|$|The {{purpose was}} to {{conserve}} foreign exchange and to protect local industry, in particular to promote manufacturing to improve employment opportunities and to reduce the economy's reliance on the rural sector. During the war the restrictions were generally recognised to be necessary {{but they were not}} dismantled only eased when conditions improved. In the early 1950s the <b>import</b> <b>licensing</b> <b>system</b> was overhauled and many categories were made exempt. The same period saw the beginning of the safety-valve no-remittance licence scheme. A balance of payments crisis in 1957 brought new controls to restrict imports but by foreign exchange allocation. Another foreign exchange crisis in 1967 brought a reversal of the easing during the previous decade. A new policy in 1979 allowed importers to obtain extra licenses when they could show [...] "significantly deficient" [...] price/quality differentials between local and imported products. By the early 1980s the industry employed around 8,000 workers. However by 1981 official thinking had begun to swing away from import controls considering they did not in the long run remedy underlying conditions though they might be entirely successful at controlling imports. If the intention was to protect local industry tariffs, officials considered, would be a more efficient tool.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{attempts}} to liberalize India's import trade regime, {{the structure of}} import licensing is still restrictive and complex and for most products, trade restrictions are probably redundant as protection. Reforming export policies alone - without reforming India's import and tax systems - will produce only marginal improvements. Problems in the export administration can be resolved only by making changes in four areas. (1) The <b>import</b> <b>licensing</b> <b>system</b> must be rationalizedto eliminate import restrictions on inputs and components. The import regime inflicts heavy administrative costs on the Indian economy. Imports of raw materials and other inputs essential for production are delayed, leaving downstream producers idle when domestic supplies are interrupted (which happens often). The export regime is still not rationalized for smaller producers, indirect exporters, and firms that rely on domestic suppliers. (2) Tariffs and excise taxes must be consolidated around two to three slabs and the quantitative restrictions in intermediate and capital goods must be eliminated so firms can be compensated accurately for their tax burdens. The system that exists is far two complex. (3) The absolute level of tariffs on inputs must be reduced to administer the duty-free import schemes efficiently. High tariffs encourage leakage of duty-free imports into the domestic market and abuse of high drawback rates (incentives). (4) Tariffs and taxes on capital goods must be reduced to reduce the costs of investment. Tariffs in India - especially on key intermediate products (metals and chemicals) and capital goods - are high and getting higher fast. The high cost of basic inputs increases the cost of production, leads to uneconomic import-substitution which causes pressure for more protection, and requires an elaborate, cumbersome system to compensate exporters. High tariffs and excise taxes on capital goods damage Indian competitiveness, adding 10 to 15 percent {{to the cost of}} production and severely handicapping exporters. The excessive tariffs do not fulfill their primary purpose of providing protection and incentives; they are aimed at mainly generating revenues. Public revenues should be generated through more efficient instruments especially taxes.

50|$|The {{most common}} {{instruments}} of direct regulation of imports (and sometimes export) are licenses and quotas. Almost all industrialized countries apply these non-tariff methods. The <b>license</b> <b>system</b> requires {{that a state}} (through specially authorized office) issues permits for foreign trade transactions of import and export commodities included in the lists of licensed merchandises. Product licensing can take many forms and procedures. The main types of licenses are general license that permits unrestricted importation or exportation of goods included in the lists for {{a certain period of}} time; and one-time license for a certain product importer (exporter) to import (or export). One-time license indicates a quantity of goods, its cost, its country of origin (or destination), and in some cases also customs point through which import (or export) of goods should be carried out. The use of <b>licensing</b> <b>systems</b> as an instrument for foreign trade regulation is based on a number of international level standards agreements. In particular, these agreements include some provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) / World Trade Organization (WTO) such as the Agreement on <b>Import</b> <b>Licensing</b> Procedures.|$|R
40|$|The thesis fills {{a gap in}} the {{literature}} about Import-substituting Industrialisation (ISI) by analysing non-tariff trade controls – mainly <b>import</b> <b>licenses.</b> The principal focus is on Mexico, a case that has not been analysed in detail. The core questions addressed include: which specific pattern licensing followed; what was the economic rationale behind such pattern; is there evidence that non-tariff controls were ‘captured’ that is, facilitating rent-seeking? In order to answer these questions, the project takes a qualitative and quantitative approach, using primary evidence gathered in archives as well as statistics from secondary sources, which are combined in novel ways. Chapter I reviews {{the literature}} on rent-seeking and on Mexican trade and industrial policies. Chapter II provides an overview of the macroeconomic context of ISI in Mexico. Chapter III presents the qualitative evidence, exploring the allocation of <b>import</b> <b>licenses</b> in nine industries, and shows how politically connected firms either obtained licenses (which gave them an advantage via cheaper inputs) or manage to block competing imports (thus earning monopoly rents). Chapter IV provides descriptive statistics of the <b>licensing</b> <b>system,</b> and demonstrates that the policy lacked internal consistency - the overwhelming majority of products were protected for far longer than officially specified, and that illegal source of rents from trade –smuggling and “free perimeters”- were significant. The main findings, which shed light on larger debates about ISI are that excessive protectionism was neither effective nor sustainable and that cronyism characterised the post-Second World War process of industrialisation in Mexico...|$|R
