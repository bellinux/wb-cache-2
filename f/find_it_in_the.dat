25|$|Since {{the wind}} was calm, Cali's {{controllers}} asked the pilots whether they wanted to fly a straight-in approach to runway 19 rather than coming around to runway 01. The pilots agreed, hoping to make up some time. The pilots then erroneously cleared the approach waypoints from their navigation computer. When the controller asked the pilots to check back in over Tuluá, north of Cali, {{it was no longer}} programmed into the computer, and so they had to pull out their maps to <b>find</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> meantime, they extended the aircraft's speed brakes to slow it down and expedite its descent.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{hearing the}} explosions {{at the power}} plant, Lance Sergeant O'Brien's group {{activated}} its own explosives. Both groups then withdrew back into the hills, just as German reinforcements were arriving at the plant. The Germans were unwilling to enter the tunnel, fearing it might be booby trapped, so they used boats belonging to the villagers to bypass the tunnel and reach the power plant. Granlund had pressed on ahead of the main group trying to locate a foot bridge to aid their escape. He did locate a mountain hut occupied by three Norwegians whom he asked for directions, {{the best they could}} do was draw him a map. Granlund left to try to locate the bridge but returned to the hut soon after being unable to <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark. He arrived back {{at the same time as}} Captain Houghton and the other Norwegian, Djupdraet, and all three entered the hut. Unknowingly while Granlund had been away two Germans had arrived at the hut and were busy questioning the occupants. In the ensuing fight, one of the Germans was killed and the other wounded. Djupdraet was also wounded, stabbed in the stomach with a bayonet.|$|E

500|$|That evening, Brigadier Savige {{came forward}} to the 2/5th Infantry Battalion's {{position}} to determine the situation, which he accurately evaluated as [...] "extremely confused; the attack was stagnant." [...] Savige adopted a plan of Walker's for a night attack, which began at 1230. Macfarlane advanced on Post 16. He sent a platoon around the flank to silently cut the wire on the western side, while he led another platoon against the northern side. A Bren gunner opening fire prematurely, alerting the defenders, but Macfarlane's men were able to overrun the post. The same tactic was used to capture Post R11. Macfarlane was supposed to capture Post R9, {{but was unable to}} <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark.

500|$|Vicky Smith of Horn Book Magazine {{felt the}} novel was gory {{compared}} to the later Disney adaptation and called it a [...] "weeper". While criticizing {{it as one of}} the most notable anti-hunting novels available, she concedes the novel is not easily forgettable and praises the [...] "linchpin scene" [...] where Bambi's mother dies, stating [...] "the understated conclusion of that scene, 'Bambi never saw his mother again,' masterfully evokes an uncomplicated emotional response". She questions Galsworthy's recommendation of the novel to sportsmen in the foreword, wondering [...] "how many budding sportsmen might have had conversion experiences in the face of Salten's unrelieved harangue and how many might have instead become alienated." [...] In comparing the novel to the Disney film, Steve Chapple of Sports Afield felt that Salten viewed Bambi's forest as a [...] "pretty scary place" [...] and the novel as a whole had a [...] "lot of dark adult undertones." [...] Interpreting it as an allegory for Salten's own life, Chapple felt Salten [...] " [...] across [...] a little morbid, a bleeding heart of a European intellectual." [...] The Wall Street Journals James P. Sterba also considered it an [...] "antifascist allegory" [...] and sarcastically notes that [...] "you'll <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> children's section at the library, a perfect place for this 293-page volume, packed as it is with blood-and-guts action, sexual conquest and betrayal" [...] and [...] "a forest full of cutthroats and miscreants. I count at least six murderers (including three child-killers) among Bambi's associates." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Nelson was 11 years old, {{the family}} moved to Fort Worth, where he barely survived typhoid fever after losing nearly half his body weight to the disease, which also left him unable to sire children. Soon after his baptism at age 12, he started caddying at Glen Garden Country Club. On his caddying days, Nelson said, [...] "I knew nothing about caddying at first, but it wasn't {{difficult}} to learn. The other caddies, though, didn't like to see any new ones, because that might mean they wouldn't get a job sometime." [...] An article on Nelson in Sports Illustrated noted that initially caddies were not permitted to play at the club: [...] "e would often practice in the dark, putting his white handkerchief over the hole so he could <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> darkness." [...] The club later changed its policy and sponsored a caddie tournament, where a 14-year-old Nelson beat fellow caddie and future golf great Ben Hogan by a single stroke after a nine-hole playoff. Nelson and Hogan were rivals but close friends in their teen years, and for the first part of their professional careers as well, but Nelson's early success was difficult for the struggling Hogan to deal with, and they gradually grew apart, while retaining mutual respect.|$|E

2500|$|On 3 September 1942, Avenger, {{under the}} command of ex-Swordfish pilot Commander Anthony Paul Colthust, left Britain for Iceland to take part in Convoy PQ 18. The weather was cold, and in [...] heavy seas one of her Sea Hurricanes broke its {{restraints}} and was lost over the side. The ship was located at sea by a Luftwaffe Focke-Wulf Condor, and shortly after arriving in Iceland, Avenger was subjected to a bombing attack by another Condor. Both of the bombs it dropped missed the ship, but two houses ashore were demolished. In their determination for PQ 18 to be a success, the Royal Navy created the largest escort force ever assembled for an Arctic convoy up until that time. Under command of Rear-Admiral Robert Burnett, the force included Avenger—the only aircraft carrier—which was joined by the anti-aircraft cruiser [...] and 16 fleet destroyers, plus the normal complement of close support sloops, corvettes, and minelayers. [...] Avenger and Scylla, with the close escort destroyers [...] and , left Iceland and joined the convoy late on 9 September 1942. One of her Swordfish aircraft was immediately sent up on an anti-submarine patrol. Bad weather prevented any flying for the following two days, but the weather cleared by noon on 12 September. The clearer skies revealed a Blohm & Voss BV 138 flying boat shadowing the convoy. Four Hurricanes took off to intercept it but could not <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> clouds. Later the same day, a Swordfish on anti-submarine patrol sighted two U-boats; they had dived by the time the escorts got into position.|$|E
2500|$|In Galicia, Russophilia {{emerged as}} early as the 1830s, when [...] "Society of scholars" [...] was {{organized}} in Przemyśl and was stimulated in part by the presence in Lviv [...] in 1835 and from 1839–1840 of Russian pan-Slavist Mikhail Pogodin who became acquainted with the local Ruthenian intelligentsia and became an influence on them. However, the movement did not come to dominate western Ukrainian society until the 1850s–60s. [...] Many proponents of Ruthenianism became disenchanted with Austria and linked themselves with the giant and powerful Russian state. The relative rise of Russia's power in comparison to that of Austria during the 19th century also played a role in such feelings. [...] Events of the 1860s helped to increase pro-Russian feelings in Galicia. [...] Traditionally, the local Ruthenians had a naive belief that the Habsburg Emperor was on their side and that he would defend them against the Polish nobility. [...] From the late 1850s, Austrian courts often sided with (primarily Polish) nobles in land disputes with peasants, during which forests and pastures that the peasants had traditionally been using were deemed the property of the nobles. [...] This led to significant economic harship for the peasants. [...] While this was happening, the Russian tsar had emancipated the peasants in Russian-ruled Ukraine. [...] In 1863-1864, an insurrection of Polish nobles in areas that included Russian-ruled Ukraine was brutally crushed by the Tsarist government, which in punishing the Polish rebels provided the Ukrainian peasants with relatively favorable compensation. Many Galicians began to approvingly contrast the Tsar's brutal treatment of the Polish nobles with the Austrians' seemingly taking the Polish side in the Polish-Ukrainian conflict. [...] Many of them came to believe that the plight of the Ukrainians was improving more under the Tsars than it was under the Austrians. In the testimony of one Austrian-Ukrainian peasant, [...] "if there is no justice in Vienna, we will <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Moskal." ...|$|E
