40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} {{the relation between}} <b>tender</b> points, complaints <b>of</b> pain, and symptoms of depression, fatigue, and sleep quality in the general population. DESIGN [...] Two stage cross sectional study with an initial questionnaire about pain to classify those eligible for an <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> points. SETTING [...] Two general practices in north west England. SUBJECTS [...] Stratified random sample of adults from age-sex registers. Of the responders, 250 were selected for <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> points {{on the basis of}} their reported pain complaints; 177 subsequently participated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Tender point count (0 to 18) grouped into four categories with the highest (> or = 11) corresponding to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology for fibromyalgia. Assessment of pain (chronic widespread, regional, none). Measures of depression, fatigue, and difficulty with sleeping. RESULTS [...] Women had a higher median tender point count (six) than did men (three). Counts were higher in those with pain than in those who had no pain and in those with widespread compared with regional pain. Most subjects with chronic widespread pain, however, had fewer than 11 tender points (27 / 45; 60 %). Two people with counts of 11 or more were in the group reporting no pain. Mean symptom scores for depression, fatigue, and sleep problems increased as the tender point count rose (P value for trend < 0. 001). These trends were independent of pain complaints. CONCLUSIONS [...] Tender points are a measure of general distress. They are related to pain complaints but are separately associated with fatigue and depression. Sleep problems are associated with tender points, although prospective studies are needed to determine whether they cause tenderness to develop. Fibromyalgia does not seem to be a distinct disease entity...|$|R

40|$|Background: Patients with rheumatic {{diseases}} treated with biological therapy are usually followed up by rheumatologists. Nurse-led rheumatology clinics {{have been proposed}} for patients with low disease activity or in remission. Objectives: To compare treatment outcomes from a nurse-led rheumatology clinic and a rheumatologist clinic for patients treated with biological therapy with low disease activity or in remission. Methods: In a prospective controlled study 107 patients were randomised into two groups with six months follow up to a nurse-led rheumatology clinic (intervention group; n= 53) or to a rheumatologist clinic (control group; n= 54). Inclusion criteria were ongoing biological therapy and Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS 28) ≤ 3. 2. All patients met the rheumatologist at inclusion and after 12 months. In the nurse-led rheumatology clinic the patients´ disease activity was assessed by <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> or swollen joints and laboratory tests. The rheumatology nurse also had a dialogue concerning the patient’s needs with regard to drug therapy, smoking habits and psychosocial aspects. Main outcome was disease activity measured by DAS 28. Results: After 12 months 97 patients completed the study. The patients had mean age of 55. 4 years, disease duration of 16. 7 years, and DAS 28 was 2. 1, with {{no significant differences between}} the two groups. In change of DAS 28 there were no differences (p= 0. 66) between the intervention group (0. 14) or control group (0. 20) from inclusion to 12 months. There were no differences (p> 0. 05) in mean change after 12 months in ESR, swollen and tender joints, global health and pain visual analogue scales (VAS) or Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) between the patients followed up at the nurse-led rheumatology clinic or the rheumatologist clinic, see table.  Table.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo assess interexaminer {{agreement}} in a structured, manual, clinical <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> the neck. To correlate these data with the score in a functional questionnaire (a validated, French-language {{version of the}} neck pain and disability scale). PatientsFifty-nine ambulatory patients (26 males and 33 females, mean±SD age: 46. 3 ± 12 yrs) with common neck pain but no radiation below the elbow. MethodsTwo medical practitioners (a junior and a senior consultant) assessed neck rotation (in degrees) {{and the presence of}} pain during maximum neck flexion and extension, muscle palpation trapezius, levator scapulae, splenius cervicis, semispinalis) and cervical spine palpation. Cohen's kappa coefficient was calculated for qualitative variables. Angular rotational values (as a continuous variable) were compared using the p coefficient. Pearson coefficient was used to correlate the number <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> spots to the results of the questionnaire. ResultsThere was no significant interexaminer difference (± 10 °) in the neck rotation measurement. Kappa was (i) 0. 71 and 0. 76 for pain in flexion or extension, respectively, (ii) 0. 44 on average for palpation of various muscles and (iii) 0. 53 on average for cervical spine palpation. The number <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> spots correlated strongly with the questionnaire score (Pearson's coefficient: 0. 35; p= 0. 007).

This has involved reviewing work done in Australia and overseas as well as exploring the efforts within the construction industry to collect cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> information. While there is currently awareness of the cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> and that efforts {{should be taken to}} minimise this cost, there is little precise understanding of it in terms of value or how it happens. This paper explores the barriers to understanding the cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering.</b> Throughout the worldwide construction industry tendering is acknowledged to be complicated, adding considerable cost to construction. Efforts to understand the cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> are confounded by issues that are both visible and invisible to formal accounting of the construction process. This paper intends to demonstrate the problems and their causes. Anecdotes are derived from the literature, observations of construction purchases, and interview data to demonstrate the barriers to understanding the cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering.</b> This is augmented by corresponding observations of other major purchases. Problems and causes are described in terms of these anecdotes. Because of the diverse activities undertaken by constructors and limitations of accounting categories, expenses associated with tendering are difficult to capture and quantify. These problems are explained through examples. Even in those cases where there are genuine intentions to capture costs <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> there is a failure to do so. It appears that implementation difficulties are so insurmountable that either people do not bother or management redirects effort from collecting cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> data. It is also shown that the expense <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> and uncertainty <b>of</b> outcomes leads tenderers to engage in concealed behaviour to reduce the uncertainty and cost associated with tendering. That is, collusion. For this reason especially, it is concluded that tendering and associated costs need to be understood in greater detail...|$|R

The next step was to conduct a questionnaire survey to ascertain the extent to which ethical behaviour in tendering is supported and practised in Australia.
