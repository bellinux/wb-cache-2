40|$|Abstract. To {{improve the}} working {{reliability}} of the high-speed gears of full mounted converter <b>tilting</b> <b>device</b> and to avoid resonance during working, the dynamics modeling of the high-speed gears is concerned. The three-dimensional model of the high-speed gears is established by using Pro/E, and the vibration modal analysis under definition contact and not definition contact are processed by using Ansys. The natural frequency and natural vibration mode of lower order vibration are obtained by the analysis, {{and it can be}} found that there has essential difference between definition contact and not definition contact. This study can provide theory basis for the normal operation of the <b>tilting</b> <b>device...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the design of}} an automobile <b>tilting</b> <b>device</b> for <b>tilting</b> of automobile bodies at mechanical workshops, when the need for maintenance arises; especially welding to be performed beneath them is always achieved using an existing traditional tilting technique. The traditional technique involves manual lifting and positioning of the automobile body with one of its sides on the work floor, after which supporting implements such as wooden bars, metal rods, worn-out tyres and pestles are used to keep the tilted bodies at the desired position. This technique has always been resulting to higher worker fatigue and much risk of worker injury, endangering the lives of mechanics. The designing and selection of the automobile <b>tilting</b> <b>device</b> components {{were based on the}} application of machine design and hydraulic principles and laws. The height and the degree of <b>tilt</b> of the <b>device</b> are controlled by the position of the control lever of the direction control valve regulating the fluid flow into the tilting and lifting cylinders. This hydraulic automobile <b>tilting</b> <b>device</b> is designed to provide a more effective and efficient technique for tilting and supporting tilted automobile bodies, thereby minimizing and eliminating the risks involved when employing the existing traditional technique. This proposed hydraulic tilting devic...|$|R

40|$|GroupTogether is {{a system}} that explores cross-device {{interaction}} using two sociological constructs. First, F-formations concern the distance and relative body orientation among multiple users, which indicate when and how people position themselves as a group. Second, micromobility describes how people orient and <b>tilt</b> <b>devices</b> towards one another to promote fine-grained sharing during co-present collaboration. We sense these constructs using: (a) a pair of overhead Kinect depth cameras to sense small groups of people, (b) low-power 8 GHz band radio modules to establish the identity, presence, and coarse-grained relative locations of devices, and (c) accelerometers to detect <b>tilting</b> of slate <b>devices.</b> The resulting system supports fluid, minimally disruptive techniques for co-located collaboration by leveraging the proxemics of people as well as the proxemics of devices.

40|$|Laboratory {{tests have}} been carried out to {{investigate}} the response of 2 x 2 pile group subjected to triangular soil movement. The pile group was instrumented with displacement and <b>tilting</b> <b>devices</b> at the pile cap and strain gauges on two piles of the group. In this paper, results from four model tests were presented to study the effects of axial loads and soil density on the lateral behavior of piles. The responses in terms of bending moment, shear force, soil pressure, deflection, and rotation of piles were compared. Test results indicate that increasing the soil strength could increase the measured moment, shear, soil pressure, and pile deformations. Most importantly, adding loads to the pile cap induces additional moment to the head of frontpile row unlike the back-pile row which was influenced insignificantly...|$|R

Then, enhancement and shadowing effects, as well as average attenuation effects, are removed with a raybased rescaling process. Finally, a novel method for reducing noise and enhancing the structures based on a modified 3 D anisotropic diffusion is applied. The diffusion scheme is improved in several steps: the diffusivity is computed locally as part of each iteration based on local statistics; two terms intended to preserve the mean value along homogeneous regions and to enhance the contrast are introduced. Results show an improvement of the contrast when applied on 3 D Transrectal US (TRUS) Images of prostate, which can facilitate further segmentation...|$|R
