5|$|In 1942, Himmler {{set up the}} Reichsschule für SS Helferinnen (Reich {{school for}} SS helpers) in Oberehnheim to train women in {{communications}} {{so that they could}} <b>free</b> <b>up</b> men for combat roles. Himmler also intended to replace all female civilian employees in his service with SS-Helferinnen members, as they were selected and trained according to NSDAP ideology. The school was closed on 22 November 1944 due to the Allied advance.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, several {{fundamental}} {{changes were made}} to the robot. The control system was reorganized and the mission control software was revamped to improve communication and to limit overhead. A low-level microcontroller-based control system was added to <b>free</b> <b>up</b> system resources. This extra processing capability will be used for mission control and image processing tasks.|$|E

The trade was primarily to <b>free</b> <b>up</b> roster spots for the Maple Leafs, who were one away from the maximum of 50 organizational contracts.|$|E

5|$|On the November ballot, {{the first}} loan would involve $19 million for parks, libraries, roads, and firehouses. The second {{authorized}} borrowing $35,750,000 for sewers and mass transit infrastructure. The third question reorganized the city's existing borrowing to <b>free</b> <b>up</b> $21,650,000 of borrowing power. On the second try, the electorate approved all three loans with 62.07%, 62.39%, and 59.13%, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The Yugoslavs re-launched Split in March 1950 to <b>free</b> <b>up</b> the slipway, but {{no other}} work was done. In 1953 there was a {{rapprochement}} with the NATO powers and the American and the British agreed to help complete the ship. The Tosi machinery ordered earlier had been used for other ships so the British agreed to furnish her propulsion machinery while the Americans provided the ship's armament, fire-control equipment and electronics.|$|E

5|$|Although Gibraltar's {{civilian}} inhabitants {{had started}} to return as early as April 1944, the last evacuees did not arrive back home until as late as February 1951. The immediate problem after VJ Day {{was a lack of}} shipping, as all available vessels were needed to bring troops home, but the longer-term problem was a lack of civilian housing. The garrison was relocated to {{the southern end of the}} peninsula to <b>free</b> <b>up</b> space and military accommodation was temporarily reused to house the returning civilians. A programme to build housing projects was implemented, though progress was slow due to shortages of building materials. By 1969, over 2,500 flats had either been built or were under construction.|$|E
5|$|Due to a {{combination}} of political and strategic decisions, it was almost two years before the battalion went into combat again. In late 1944, in order to <b>free</b> <b>up</b> American troops for operations in the Philippines, Australian forces were directed to take over responsibility for operations around Aitape in New Guinea. The 6th Division returned to New Guinea in November 1944, with the final brigade arriving on 31 December 1944. Although basically cut off from resupply, there were around 35,000 Japanese troops in the area, holding the coast past Wewak and into the interior. Supported by food supplies from native gardens in the Torricelli Mountains, the Japanese put up heavy resistance to the Australians' primary tactic of aggressive patrolling.|$|E
5|$|Habsburg was {{launched}} on 9 September 1900, Árpád {{just over a}} year later on 11 September 1901, and Babenberg on 4 October 1902. The ships saw limited service during World War I in the IV Division of the Austro-Hungarian fleet. Babenberg and Árpád bombarded the Italian port of Ancona in 1915, but the three battleships were largely inactive for the remainder of their service. They were decommissioned in 1916 to <b>free</b> <b>up</b> the majority of their crews for service in the submarine and air forces. All three ships were ultimately ceded to Great Britain following the end of the war; they were sold to Italian ship-breakers and scrapped in 1921.|$|E

5|$|Having subdued German defences on the beach, {{the next}} {{task of the}} landed forces was to clear Juno of obstacles, debris and undetonated mines then {{establish}} the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division's headquarters in Bernières. Movement Control Units came ashore just before noon, with military policemen beginning to marshal vehicles through to Bernières and Courseulles. Sappers of 619 Independent Field Company also moved in to begin clearing the minefields surrounding the beach, so as to <b>free</b> <b>up</b> the advance south towards Carpiquet. Keller himself established divisional headquarters in Bernières shortly after noon.|$|E
5|$|I-95 {{runs from}} north to south through Providence while I-195 connects the city to eastern Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts, {{including}} New Bedford, Massachusetts, and Cape Cod. I-295 encircles Providence while RI 146 provides a direct connection with Worcester, Massachusetts. The city commissioned and began a long-term project, the Iway, to move I-195 in 2007 not only for safety reasons, but also to <b>free</b> <b>up</b> land and to reunify the Jewelry District with Downcity Providence, which had been split from one another by the highway. The project was estimated to cost $610 million.|$|E
5|$|In the Year of Four Emperors, 69AD, the Iazyges {{gave their}} support to Vespasian, {{who went on}} to become the sole emperor of Rome. The Iazyges also offered to guard the Roman border with the Dacians, in order to <b>free</b> <b>up</b> troops for Vespasian's {{invasion}} of Italy; however, Vespasian refused, fearing that they would attempt a takeover or defect. Vespasian did require the chiefs of the Iazyges to serve in his army, so that they could not organize an attack on the undefended area around the Danube. Vespasian enjoyed support from the majority of the Germanic and Dacian tribes.|$|E
50|$|Of the 11 area codes <b>freed</b> <b>up</b> for {{alternative}} {{use in the}} 1980s, only 5 were actually re-used for other services. For example, the 0541 area code was re-allocated to C&WC Area Call services. Six of the area codes remained unused. In 1995, the PhONEday changes for geographic numbers solved the number shortage problem for mobile and non-geographic services by <b>freeing</b> <b>up</b> the whole 07, 08 and 09 range for their use from 2000 onwards.|$|R

5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19thcentury the {{population}} of London more than doubled, from a little under a million people in 1801 to almost two and a half million in 1851. Despite this rapid growth in population, the amount of land set aside for use as graveyards remained unchanged at approximately , spread across around 200 small sites. The difficulty of digging without disturbing existing graves led to bodies often simply being stacked on top of each other to fit the available space and covered with a layer of earth. In more crowded areas even relatively fresh graves had to be exhumed to <b>free</b> <b>up</b> space for new burials, their contents being unearthed and scattered to <b>free</b> <b>up</b> space. In some cases large pits were dug on existing burial grounds, unearthing the previous burials, and fresh corpses crammed into the available space. Intact material from burials was sold on a thriving market in second hand coffin furniture, coffin wood was burned as household fuel, and exhumed bones were shipped in bulk to the north of England to be sold as fertiliser. Decaying corpses contaminated the water supply and the city suffered regular epidemics of cholera, smallpox, measles and typhoid; in 1842 the mean working life of a London professional man was 30 years and of a London labourer just 17 years.|$|E
5|$|Morris had fully {{expected}} the Sandy Bar Saulteaux to sign Treaty 5, The Lake Winnipeg Treaty in 1875.

In return the First Nations would be granted reserve land, $5.00 per person annual payment, two oxen, one bull and four cows for each band, an annual payment of $50.00 salary for the Chief and three executive officers amounting to $70.00 total, as well as agricultural implements. The Chief also received a flag and medal.|$|E
5|$|On March 11, General Ngô Quang Trưởng ordered General Trần Văn Nhựt to {{mobilise}} the 2nd Division (South Vietnam), the 12th Ranger Group, {{elements of}} the 11th Armoured Squadron and one regional force battalion to mount a counter-attack from Tuan Duong to Cam Khe and Duong Con. General Trưởng also ordered the ARVN 2nd Infantry Regiment (3rd Infantry Division) to depart from Da Nang, and protect Tam Kỳ, so that General Nhut's forces could be <b>free</b> <b>up</b> to fight the North Vietnamese.|$|E

5|$|Principe di Carignano saw action {{during the}} Battle of Lissa in 1866 during the Third Italian War of Independence. There, {{she led the}} Italian line, the {{flagship}} of Admiral Giovanni Vacca; the leading squadron of the Italian fleet became separated {{from the rest of}} the fleet and was not heavily engaged. Her career was limited after the war, owing to the emergence of more modern ironclads and a severe reduction in the Italian naval budget following their defeat at Lissa. The ship was stricken from the naval register in 1875 and broken up for scrap to <b>free</b> <b>up</b> funds needed for new ironclads under construction.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Armoured Brigade was {{established}} in February 1943 {{as part of a}} reorganisation of the Australian Army's armoured units. As there was no longer any threat of Japanese forces invading Australia, the 2nd Armoured Division was disbanded to <b>free</b> <b>up</b> manpower for other purposes. However, it was decided to retain the headquarters of that division's 6th Armoured Brigade to command armoured units that were intended to take part in offensive operations in New Guinea and other locations in the South West Pacific. This specialised formation was designated the 4th Armoured Brigade. The need for armoured support of infantry forces had been demonstrated by the Army's experiences in the New Guinea Campaign during 1942 and early 1943.|$|E
5|$|The Wessex Division—now {{numbered}} as the 43rd—had {{been assigned}} for duty in India to <b>free</b> <b>up</b> regular units there, with its staff and support units held back {{to form the}} framework of the new 8th Division, which was formed from returning regular battalions. As a result, Pinney was relieved from command of his Territorial brigade in October and assigned to command the newly formed 23rd Brigade, made up from three battalions that had been on garrison duty in Malta and one from Egypt. All were regular units, with very few reservists, but having spent a long period in colonial stations they were considered as only partially trained compared to the units serving with the Expeditionary Force.|$|E
