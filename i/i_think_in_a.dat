500|$|Britten's early musical {{life was}} {{dominated}} by the classical masters; his mother's ambition was for him to become the [...] "Fourth B" [...] – after Bach, Beethoven and Brahms. Britten was later to assert that his initial development as a composer was stifled by reverence for these masters: [...] "Between the ages of thirteen and sixteen I knew every note of Beethoven and Brahms. I remember receiving the full score of Fidelio for my fourteenth birthday... But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sense I never forgave them for having led me astray in my own particular thinking and natural inclinations". He developed a particular animosity towards Brahms, whose piano music he had once held in great esteem; in 1952 he confided that he played through all Brahms's music from time to time, [...] "to see if I am right about him; I usually find that I underestimated last time how bad it was!" ...|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} March 2011, using digital cinematography. Wirkola said, [...] "Hopefully – {{you can see}} what I’m inspired by: Raimi and Jackson. Actually I’m a big fan of [...] Spielberg and the way he shoots action scenes. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lot of modern action movies, it’s hard to see what’s going on. Shaky cam… Hopefully what we strived for was to go a little retro in how you shoot action scenes." [...] The film was shot in 3-D and its real 3D shots were done by lead stereographer Florian Maier and his team from Stereotec. Wirkola said: [...] "We shot half of it in real 3D and the other half was post converted. Actually the 3D thing wasn’t there in the beginning. It was something the studio suggested later on. We embraced it and I think it actually really helps in getting people into this fairy tale world." [...] The filming process took three months. A 12-minute B-roll footage was later released on the Internet.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Cuccinelli stated [...] "homosexuality is wrong." [...] During his 2009 {{campaign}} for attorney general, he stated [...] "My {{view is that}} homosexual acts, not homosexuality, but homosexual acts are wrong. They’re intrinsically wrong. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> natural law based country it’s appropriate to have policies that reflect that. ... They don’t comport with natural law. I happen {{to think that it}} represents (to put it politely; I need my thesaurus to be polite) behavior that is not healthy to an individual and in aggregate is not healthy to society." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to a 2006 Newsweek interview, [...] "For Graham, {{politics}} is a secondary to the Gospel.... When Newsweek asked Graham whether ministers—whether they {{think of themselves as}} evangelists, pastors or a bit of both—should spend time engaged with politics, he replied: 'You know, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> way that has to be up to the individual as he feels led of the Lord. A lot of things that I commented on years ago would not have been of the Lord, I'm sure, but I think you have some—like communism, or segregation, on which I think you have a responsibility to speak out.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{could have}} done lots more, put in much more work and {{developed}} more pictures, but I had also a desire to say what I felt about life. Simple things like a little picture in the window or {{the corner of the}} studio or an old stove in the kitchen have always been fascinating to me. They are very much alive, these flowers and grasses with the dew on them. Stieglitz always said, [...] "What have you got to say?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few small cases I've said a few things, expressed how I felt, trying to show the horror of poverty or the beauty of black people. I think that in photography what you've done is what you've had to say. In everything this has been the message of my life. A simple supper, being with someone you love, seeing a deer come around to eat or drink at the barn - I like things like that. If I could make one true, quiet photograph, I would much prefer it to having a lot of answers.|$|E
2500|$|Although McKenna avoided {{giving his}} {{allegiance}} {{to any one}} interpretation (part of his rejection of monotheism), he was open {{to the idea of}} psychedelics as being [...] "trans-dimensional travel". He proposed that DMT sent one to a [...] "parallel dimension" [...] and that psychedelics literally enabled an individual to encounter 'higher dimensional entities' or what could be ancestors or spirits of the Earth, saying that if you can trust your own perceptions it appears that you are entering an [...] "ecology of souls." [...] McKenna also put forward the idea that psychedelics were [...] "doorways into the Gaian mind", suggesting that [...] "the planet has a kind of intelligence, it can actually open a channel of communication with an individual human being" [...] and that the psychedelic plants were the facilitators of this communication. In a more radical version of biophysicist Francis Crick's hypothesis of directed panspermia, McKenna speculated on the idea that psilocybin mushrooms may be a species of high intelligence, which may have arrived on this planet as spores migrating through space and which are attempting to establish a symbiotic relationship with human beings. He postulated that [...] "intelligence, not life, but intelligence may have come here [...] in this spore-bearing life form". He said, [...] "I think that theory will probably be vindicated. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hundred years if people do biology they will think it quite silly that people once thought that spores could not be blown from one star system to another by cosmic radiation pressure," [...] and also believed that [...] "few people {{are in a position to}} judge its extraterrestrial potential, because few people in the orthodox sciences have ever experienced the full spectrum of psychedelic effects that are unleashed." ...|$|E

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{few weeks}} to try another excursion; though to what end?

6000|$|DEAR SIR,--I am so {{accustomed}} to hear nonsense spoken about all the arts, and the drama in particular, that I cannot refrain from saying [...] "Thank you" [...] for your paper.

6000|$|I have, thirdly, a {{group of}} {{recollections}} which refer to Scotland.

At Edinburgh our sojourn was in the Royal Hotel, Princes [...] Street. I well remember the rattling of the windows when the castle [...] guns were fired on some great occasion, probably the abdication of [...] Napoleon, for the date of the journey was, I think, the spring of [...] 1814.|$|E
60|$|I {{nodded and}} glanced {{over the edge}} of the stone at Bastin's lantern which was sailing {{alongside}} of us, till presently we passed it. Bastin had lit it before we started, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> moment of aberration, and it burned for quite a long while, showing like a star when the shaft grew darker as it did by degrees, a circumstance that testifies to the excellence of the make, which is one advertised not to go out in any wind. Not that we felt wind, or even draught, perhaps because we were travelling with it.|$|E
60|$|We may now {{return to}} the purpose of our awkward {{parenthesis}} about the praise of the future and the failures of the past. A house of his own being the obvious ideal for every man, we may now ask (taking this need as typical of all such needs) why he hasn't got it; and whether it is in any philosophical sense his own fault. Now, I think that in some philosophical sense it is his own fault, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> yet more philosophical sense it is the fault of his philosophy. And this is what I have now to attempt to explain.|$|E

60|$|I found a once much-loved {{and still}} much-loved female, {{literally}} and truly cast {{out to the}} mercy of the naked elements--but there is no sporting with a fellow-creature's happiness or misery.... The most placid good-nature and sweetness of disposition; a warm heart, gratefully devoted with all its powers to love me; vigorous health and sprightly cheerfulness, set off to the best advantage by a more than common handsome figure--these, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> woman may make a good wife though she should never have read a page but the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, nor have danced in a brighter assembly than a penny pay wedding.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, nay, not ingratitude!" [...] the Mugger said. [...] "They do {{not think}} for others; that is all. But I have noticed, lying at my station below the ford, that the stairs of the new bridge are cruelly hard to climb, both for old people and young children. The old, indeed, are not so worthy of consideration, but I am grieved--I am truly grieved--on account of the fat children. Still, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> little while, when the newness of the bridge has worn away, we shall see my people's bare brown legs bravely {{splashing}} through the ford as before. Then the old Mugger will be honoured again." ...|$|E
60|$|It is cold, {{but very}} sunshiny and dry; I {{wish you were}} here; it would suit you and it doesn't suit me; if we could change? This is the Fast day--Thursday {{preceding}} bi-annual Holy Sacrament that is--nobody does any work, they go to Church twice, they read nothing secular (except the newspapers, that is the nuance between Fast day and Sunday), they eat like fighting-cocks. Behold how good a thing it is and becoming well to fast in Scotland. I am progressing with John Knox and Women No. 2; I shall finish it, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fortnight hence; and then I shall begin to enjoy myself. J. K. and W. No. 2 is not uninteresting however; it only bores me because I am so anxious to be at something else which I like better. I shall perhaps go to Church this afternoon from a sort of feeling that it is rather a wholesome thing to do of an afternoon; it keeps one from work and it lets you out so late that you cannot weary yourself walking and so spoil your evening's work.|$|E
60|$|I thank Mr. Chestle warmly, {{and shake}} hands. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am <b>in</b> <b>a</b> happy dream. I waltz with the eldest Miss Larkins once again. She says I waltz so well!
