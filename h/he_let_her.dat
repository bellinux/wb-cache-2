5|$|In 1973, Mavis starts dating {{the equally}} shy Jerry Booth (Graham Haberfield), {{but it remains}} platonic. Jerry dies {{of a heart attack}} in 1975 before being able to express his romantic intentions. She meets {{salesman}} Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin) the following year. They date, but the relationship is strained by Derek's interfering mother, who believes that Mavis is not good enough for her son. The relationship remains non-committal until 1983, when another man competes for Mavis's hand, the artistic Victor Pendlebury (Christopher Coll). Mavis is torn as she likes both but chooses Derek in the end. On their wedding day in 1984 Mavis has second thoughts about marrying Derek and jilts him at the altar. Her guilt turns to indignation when she learns that Derek– feeling the same way she does– did not attend the ceremony either. Derek goes on to an unhappy marriage with Angela Hawthorne (Diane Fletcher), but in 1986 he begins wooing Mavis again, realizing he made a mistake when <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> go. Mavis eventually decides Derek is the man for her and the couple marry in September 1988. The other residents of Coronation Street consider Mavis and Derek something of a joke, but neither care as they are genuinely in love. They spend evenings reading aloud to each other and discussing the events of the day. They remain happy despite the occasional problem, but their happiness is cut short in 1997 when Derek dies suddenly of a heart attack after a road rage incident. Devastated, at his funeral Mavis chastises those who mocked her marriage over the years.|$|E
25|$|In September 2010, {{the court}} awarded Biryukova full custody of both children. She {{refused to let}} them see Solomon, {{who did not have}} any visitation rights. He {{continued}} to press the issue in court, along with some other issues such as property they both owned. She offered to forego alimony and child support if <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> move to Arizona with the children, but he refused.|$|E
25|$|Willis is {{also charged}} with the {{attempted}} kidnapping of an unnamed 16-year-old girl in Laketon Township on April 16, 2016, when she was lost and <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> use his phone {{and gave her a}} ride. After he pulled away, he locked the doors and reached for {{what appeared to be a}} gun, but she managed to escape with minor injuries after she said she couldn't breathe and convinced him to open her window.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{she fell}} to {{thinking}} about her aunt. [...] "I {{would like to go}} home," [...] she cried, [...] "to please her. She has been a dear. Considering how little <b>he</b> <b>lets</b> <b>her</b> have." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lily won't {{feel the}} want of money. It is not that. But if <b>he</b> <b>lets</b> <b>her</b> {{know that she}} {{has made him a}} poor man, then she will be unhappy. Is he extravagant, Bernard?" ...|$|R
50|$|Julia befriends Martin and {{secretly}} begins giving him Anafranil (a pill for OCD), pretending {{that it is}} a vitamin. Martin is aware that she is giving him the medication, but <b>he</b> <b>lets</b> <b>her</b> think <b>he</b> doesn't know.|$|R
2500|$|At {{midnight on}} Saturday 8 February 1879, Ned Kelly, Dan Kelly, Hart and Byrne {{surrounded}} the Jerilderie police barracks. Constables George Denis Devine and Henry Richards were on duty that night. Hart, {{in a loud}} voice, shouted, [...] "Devine, there's a drunken man at Davidson's Hotel, who has committed murder. Get up at once, all of you." [...] Richards, who was sleeping {{at the rear of}} the premises, came to the front door. Devine opened the door, meeting Kelly who told him there was a great row at Davidson's. Devine approached Kelly, who once he established there were no other policemen, pointed two revolvers at the policemen, introduced the gang, telling the officers to hold up their hands. Immediately the police were pounced upon by the other men and placed in the lock-up cell, and Mrs Devine and children were held hostage in the sitting-room. Afterwards Ned stole all the firearms and ammunition and toured the house with Devine to make certain there were no other policemen. After this, <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> and the children turn in to sleep as usual, and with the rest of the gang went into the sitting room, where they kept watch till morning.|$|E
2500|$|Bogart met Lauren Bacall while filming To Have and Have Not (1944), a loose {{adaptation}} of the Ernest Hemingway novel. The movie has many similarities with Casablanca—the same enemies, {{the same kind of}} hero, even a piano player sidekick (played by Hoagy Carmichael). When they met, Bacall was 19 and Bogart 44. He nicknamed her [...] "Baby." [...] She had been a model since 16 and had acted in two failed plays. Bogart was drawn to Bacall's high cheekbones, green eyes, tawny blond hair, and lean body, as well as her maturity, poise and earthy, outspoken honesty. [...] Reportedly he said, [...] "I just saw your test. We'll {{have a lot of fun}} together". Their physical and emotional rapport was very strong from the start, their age difference and disparity in acting experience allowing the dynamic of a mentor-student relationship to emerge. Quite contrary to Hollywood norm, their affair was Bogart's first with a leading lady. He was still married and his early meetings with Bacall were discreet and brief, their separations bridged by ardent love letters. [...] The relationship made it much easier for the newcomer to make her first film, and Bogart did his best to put her at ease with jokes and quiet coaching. <b>He</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> steal scenes and even encouraged it. Howard Hawks, for his part, also did his best to boost her performance and highlight her role, and found Bogart easy to direct.|$|E
60|$|He made no {{movement}} or sound. <b>He</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> hold his hand, <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> reach forward, {{in the gathering}} darkness, and kiss his still cheek. The crying had gone by--he would not cry any more. He was whole and himself again.|$|E
5000|$|Afraid of {{his second}} wife who {{had given birth to}} son for him, <b>he</b> <b>lets</b> <b>her</b> bully him and his {{daughter}} Yue Ya, even allowing her to sell Yue Ya to their elderly landlord as a wife.|$|R
50|$|Charlie Brown is {{generally}} generous: for instance, on one strip where Lucy {{took all of}} his caramels when <b>he</b> <b>lets</b> <b>her</b> get one, <b>he</b> easily forgives her and offers her the sack he was carrying the caramels in.|$|R
50|$|Neither Red nor Cassie {{have any}} money, so <b>he</b> <b>lets</b> <b>her</b> stay at his apartment. They find {{new jobs and}} save money for their divorce, though Cassie does her best to get Red {{to change his mind}} about {{splitting}} up.|$|R
60|$|Philip {{noticed her}} hesitation, and half {{interpreted}} it. <b>He</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> passive head fall.|$|E
60|$|Gallant gentleman as he was, <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> {{think she}} had invented the phrase.|$|E
60|$|Foster saw {{she would}} say no more about it, which seemed significant, and <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> go on.|$|E
60|$|GRACE. Yes, Leonard; but I'm an {{advanced}} woman. (He checks himself {{and looks at}} her in some consternation.) I'm what my father calls a New Woman. (<b>He</b> <b>lets</b> <b>her</b> go and stares at her.) I quite agree with all your ideas.|$|R
6000|$|... "The Ogre, it seems, {{has come}} to see that {{bullying}} won't do. He's given in tremendously. <b>He's</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> have her way with the waitress strike and she's {{going to have an}} allowance of her own and all kinds of things. It's settled. It's his mother and that man Charterson talked him over. You know--his mother came to me--as her friend. For advice. Wanted to find out what sort of things we might have been putting in her head. She said so. A curious old thing--vulgar but--wise. I liked her. He's her darling--and she just knows what he is.... He doesn't like it but he's taken his dose. The thought of her going to prison again----! <b>He's</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> do anything rather than that...." ...|$|R
50|$|Dragon helps Jane as she {{trains to}} become a knight. When she is on patrol duty, <b>he</b> <b>lets</b> <b>her</b> ride on his back as he flies around the kingdom. Jane in turn helps Dragon, who is an orphan, {{in his efforts to}} uncover the secrets of his ancestry.|$|R
60|$|So <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> cry, {{and said}} no more, but sat with her cold hand in his warm, easy clasp.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> go then. He {{fell back}} with an oath, a patch of fingermarks showing red on his white countenance.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> go {{and when}} she passed a bench where Mrs. Halliday and Mordaunt sat the former looked at her companion.|$|E
6000|$|SERGIUS. That shews {{that you}} are an abominable little clod of common clay, with {{the soul of a}} servant. (<b>He</b> <b>lets</b> <b>her</b> go as if she were an unclean thing, and turns away, dusting his hands of her, to the bench by the wall, where he sits down with averted head, meditating gloomily.) ...|$|R
60|$|MARY. Cook's been up again. <b>He</b> wouldn't <b>let</b> <b>her</b> pass. She'll have {{to sleep}} in the spare room.|$|R
6000|$|As yet John {{does not}} {{understand}} all this. The idea is new and strange to him. He feels as the child in a fairy story on suddenly discovering that the trees and flowers has he passed by carelessly a thousand times can think and talk. Once he whispers to her of the labour and the danger, but she answers simply, [...] "They are my people too, John: it is my work"; and <b>he</b> <b>lets</b> <b>her</b> have her way.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> {{come and}} look at his book; but, to her surprise, he had before him a very easy problem in Euclid.|$|E
60|$|She {{submitted}} prettily. Then, when <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> go, {{she began}} to skip, with a curious flicking up of one leg behind her.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Very ill,' said Kalliope. 'Richard {{came last}} night, and <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> {{know what we}} had kept from her; but she is calmer now.' ...|$|E
50|$|Charlie offers Mabel {{a ride on}} his {{two-seater}} motorcycle, {{which she}} accepts in preference to his rival's racing car.

50|$|<b>He</b> <b>lets</b> <b>her</b> date, {{but when}} she brings a date home, he does become embarrassing. For example, when she brought Jake home he gave them two seconds to kiss. And when her and Jake were alone and started to make out, from the air vent Robby told them to stop kissing and start talking.|$|R
40|$|Letter from Charles Moore to Mary Moore {{in which}} <b>he</b> <b>lets</b> <b>her</b> {{know the details}} of the weather; updates her on the {{activities}} of friends and family; and gives news of the farm.

6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> hand go. If {{he held it}} {{a moment}} longer, {{and a little more}} firmly than was {{absolutely}} necessary, was he much to blame? ...|$|E
60|$|In his {{surprise}} <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> free, {{and in that}} moment he was swung back and round and cast a good six paces down the room.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{it worth}} while?" [...] he counter-questioned, and, whether intent or accident, <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> see {{something}} of himself. [...] "Is it even amusing--to be serious?" ...|$|E
