500|$|Type IIn supernovae are {{not listed}} in the table. [...] They can {{potentially}} be produced by various types of core collapse in different progenitor stars, possibly even by Type Ia white dwarf <b>ignitions,</b> although it seems that most will be from iron core collapse in luminous supergiants or hypergiants (including LBVs). The narrow spectral lines {{for which they are}} named occur because the supernova is expanding into a small dense cloud of circumstellar material. [...] It appears that a significant proportion of supposed Type IIn supernovae are actually supernova impostors, massive eruptions of LBV-like stars similar to the Great Eruption of Eta Carinae. [...] In these events, material previously ejected from the star creates the narrow absorption lines and causes a shock wave through interaction with the newly ejected material.|$|E

The forest operates a fire management plan under federal fire policy that gives fire personnel direction for responding to unintended <b>ignitions.</b> Occasionally, area closures and restrictions on use, such as prohibition of campfires, are implemented to aid in wildfire prevention. Following severe fires, area closures may be put in place to protect the public from risks such as falling trees and landslides. Proactive fire management strategies include prescribed burns and mechanical reduction of fuel levels. For instance, in 2014 Boise National Forest planned to conduct [...] of prescribed burns and [...] of mechanical treatment.

When total <b>ignition</b> energy remains constant, the dual-coil coupled discharge mode can improve energy conversion efficiency.

Minimum <b>ignition</b> energies were measured for n-heptane and methanol sprays characterized at the spark gap in terms of droplet diameter, equivalence ratio (number density) and extent of prevaporization. In addition to sprays, minimum <b>ignition</b> energies were measured for completely prevaporized mixtures of the same fuels over a range of equivalence ratios to provide data at the lower limit of droplet size.
