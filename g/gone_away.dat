Supposedly, Oscar-winning actress Holly Hunter broke university tradition by signing the Green Room during her freshman year.

25|$|The {{number of}} {{minority}} officers, however, has remained small. A cadet {{program aimed at}} smoothing the way onto the force for black and Hispanic young people was struck down in 1997 as unconstitutional reverse discrimination. On top of that, a well-publicized cheating scandal on the 1996 police exam further undermined confidence in {{the fairness of the}} hiring process. Controversy surrounding these issues has abated somewhat, but has not <b>gone</b> <b>away</b> entirely.|$|E
25|$|The {{wide range}} of {{possibilities}} (including impossibility) of interpretation of monochrome paintings is arguably why the monochrome is so engaging to so many artists, critics, and writers. Although the monochrome has never become dominant and few artists have committed themselves exclusively to it, it has never <b>gone</b> <b>away.</b> It reappears as though a spectre haunting high modernism, or {{as a symbol of}} it, appearing during times of aesthetic and sociopolitical upheavals.|$|E
25|$|If {{another blow}} to the head occurs after a {{concussion}} but before its symptoms have <b>gone</b> <b>away,</b> there is a slight risk of developing the serious second-impact syndrome (SIS). In SIS, the brain rapidly swells, greatly increasing intracranial pressure. People who have repeated mild head injuries over a prolonged period, such as boxers and Gridiron football players, are at risk for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (or the related variant dementia pugilistica), a severe, chronic disorder involving a decline in mental and physical abilities.|$|E

25|$|In her journal, Butler {{wrote that}} she had gotten Genie to stop attacking herself when angry and had taught Genie to instead express her anger through words or by hitting objects. Butler also claimed that, shortly after moving in with her, Genie had become noticeably more talkative and {{that she had}} made {{substantial}} progress with her language acquisition. In an early August letter to Jay Shurley, she wrote that the man she was dating had also noticed and commented on the improvement in her language. Genie's incontinence gradually improved until, by the end of her stay, it had almost entirely <b>gone</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{whole family}} takes ill {{suddenly}} (apart from Bryan and Alexander who had <b>gone</b> <b>away</b> {{for a few}} days) and Alfred dies. Later, the curry made by Lucy on the fateful day is found to contain arsenic. Some days later, Harold, after returning home to London, receives a delivery of some tablets {{that appear to be}} the same as the sleeping pills prescribed to him by Dr. Quimper, who had told him he need not take them any more. The box they come in is actually the box for Emma's sedatives that were swapped for something else. They prove to be poisoned with aconitine and Harold dies.|$|E
25|$|In 1916 whilst {{serving in}} the Lincolnshire Regiment, {{suffering}} from severe lumbago Jessop {{was sent to a}} clinic in Bath The Radiant Heat Treatment ' involved dousing with total immersion for 30 minutes at a temperature of 210-310 degrees F'. The patient was placed in an up-ended coffin like structure and steamed up. If he became too uncomfortable he could raise the lid and get out. By some 'accident' the catch fell, the attendant had <b>gone</b> <b>away</b> and Jessop was unable to summon assistance. When he was eventually rescued his heart had been seriously damaged by this terrible ordeal. In a matter of minutes the sporting life of one of the greatest athletes had come to an abrupt end.|$|E

500|$|People {{who have}} had a {{concussion}} seem more susceptible to another one, particularly if the new injury occurs before symptoms from the previous concussion have completely <b>gone</b> <b>away.</b> It is also a negative process if smaller impacts cause the same symptom severity.

500|$|Manager Terry Butcher {{had hoped}} to keep Davis and two other loanees for the whole season, because they had all {{performed}} well {{and he had no}} budget to add to the squad, but the player chose to return to England where he could go on loan somewhere closer to his parent club. According to Butcher, Mick McCarthy [...] "felt David had <b>gone</b> <b>away</b> a boy and returned a man, as regular SPL action had developed him physically and improved his match awareness." ...|$|E

500|$|The Bhagavata Purana and Vishnu Purana {{tells the}} story of Prithu: King Vena, from the lineage of the pious Dhruva, was an evil king, who {{neglected}} Vedic rituals. Thus the rishis (sages) killed him, leaving the kingdom without an heir and in famine due to the anarchy of Vena. So, the sages churned Vena's body, out of which first appeared a dark dwarf hunter, a symbol of Vena's evil. Since the sins of Vena had <b>gone</b> <b>away</b> as the dwarf, the body was now pure. On further churning, Prithu emerged from right arm of the corpse. To end the famine by slaying the earth and getting her fruits, Prithu chased the earth (Prithvi) who fled as a cow.|$|E
500|$|The {{problems}} with the Barbary states had never <b>gone</b> <b>away,</b> and on 10 May 1801 the Tripolitans declared war on the United States by chopping down the flag {{in front of the}} American Embassy, which began the First Barbary War. [...] was captured by the Moors, but then set on fire in an American raid led by Stephen Decatur. The Marines invaded the [...] "shores of Tripoli" [...] in 1805, capturing the city of Derna, the first time the U.S. flag ever flew over a foreign conquest. This act was enough to induce the Barbary rulers to sign peace treaties. Subsequently, the Navy was greatly reduced for reasons of economy, and instead of regular ships, many gunboats were built, intended for coastal use only. This policy proved completely ineffective within a decade.|$|E

500|$|Pranks {{at the two}} {{institutions}} {{are seen as a}} way to relax from the stress of the notoriously rigorous academics of each. [...] Both Caltech and MIT have a set of pranking ethics, stating that pranks should be reversible and not cause permanent damage, and emphasize creativity and originality. [...] In recent years, pranking has been officially encouraged by Tom Mannion, Caltech's Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs and Campus Life. [...] "The grand old days of pranking have <b>gone</b> <b>away</b> at Caltech, and that's {{what we are trying to}} bring back," [...] reported The Boston Globe, which noted that [...] "security has orders not to intervene in a prank unless officers get Mannion's approval beforehand." [...] However, hacks at MIT are generally more secretive and often do not involve identifying the hackers.|$|E
500|$|When Grant {{was nine}} years old, his father placed his mother in Glenside Hospital (a mental institution), {{and told him that}} she had <b>gone</b> <b>away</b> on a [...] "long holiday", later declaring that she had died. Grant grew up resenting his mother, {{particularly}} after she left the family. After Elsie was gone, Grant and his father moved into the home of his grandmother in Bristol. When Grant was 10, his father remarried and started a new family that did not include his son. Grant did not learn that his mother was still alive until he was 31, when his father confessed to the lie, shortly before his own death. Grant made arrangements for his mother to leave the institution in June 1935, shortly after he learned of her whereabouts. He visited her during a break to England in October 1938, after filming for Gunga Din was completed.|$|E
500|$|The {{first episode}} of the season, [...] "Nothing Important Happened Today", {{gathered}} 10.6 million viewers, whereas the second part gathered only 9.4 million viewers. On May 19, 2002, the series finale, [...] "The Truth", aired, and the Fox Broadcasting Company confirmed that The X-Files was not being renewed for a tenth season. When talking about {{the beginning of the}} ninth season, Chris Carter said, [...] "We lost our audience on the first episode. It's like the audience had <b>gone</b> <b>away,</b> and I didn't know how to find them. I didn't want to work to get them back because I believed what we are doing deserved to have them back." [...] "The Truth" [...] received the highest Nielsen household rating and viewership numbers of the season. It earned a 7.5 rating and gathered 13.25 million viewers in the United States. The loss of viewers resulted in this season seeing a 30 percent ratings drop when compared to the eighth season.|$|E
