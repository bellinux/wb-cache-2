25|$|In 1984, Leinbach joined NASA as a {{structural}} engineer. Initially, Leinbach was a lead design engineer for various launch pad systems, including weather protection and the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Egress</b> Slide Wire system. In 1988, Leinbach became a NASA Test Director (NTD), responsible for directing daily operations at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Launch Complex. In 1991, {{he was named}} Shuttle Test Director, and conducted the terminal countdown and launch of seventeen shuttle missions, {{in addition to being}} responsible for all planning activities associated with pre-launch.|$|E

25|$|The aircraft's {{aerodynamic}} {{design has}} been modified {{based on the}} test flights completed {{and the use of}} computer models with the aim of increasing performance. Changes include altering the engine thrust angle, which has made a large improvement. On the final production aircraft the right side door has been eliminated to save weight. The door will be replaced by an <b>emergency</b> <b>egress</b> hatch. The production aircraft will also have a more pointed nose, larger belly section, redesigned wing-root fairing, reduced tail sweep and a larger or even dual ventral fin.|$|E
25|$|Sensory and {{sensorimotor}} disturbances when {{arriving in}} low Earth orbit are well documented, the most known of these being space motion sickness (SMS). Individual differences, spacecraft size, and body movements cause SMS symptoms. Typically lasting {{the first three}} or four days of weightlessness, symptoms range from headaches and fatigue to nausea and vomiting. The consequences vary from simple discomfort to possible incapacitation, creating potential problems during extra-vehicular activity, re-entry, and <b>emergency</b> <b>egress</b> from the spacecraft. The body receives a variety of conflicting signals from the visual, somato-sensory, and vestibular organs in weightlessness. These conflicting inputs are thought to be the primary cause of SMS, but the precise mechanisms of the conflict are not well understood. Medications currently used to alleviate the symptoms produce undesirable side effects.|$|E
25|$|The first {{priority}} when beginning a settlement was {{the location and}} construction of the church (iglesia). The majority of mission sanctuaries were oriented on a roughly east-west axis to {{take the best advantage}} of the sun's position for interior illumination; the exact alignment depended on the geographic features of the particular site. Once the spot for the church had been selected, its position was marked and the remainder of the mission complex was laid out. The workshops, kitchens, living quarters, storerooms, and other ancillary chambers were usually grouped {{in the form of a}} quadrangle, inside which religious celebrations and other festive events often took place. The cuadrángulo was rarely a perfect square because the missionaries had no surveying instruments at their disposal and simply measured off all dimensions by foot. Some fanciful accounts regarding the construction of the missions claimed that underground tunnels were incorporated in the design, to be used as a means of <b>emergency</b> <b>egress</b> in the event of attack; however, no historical evidence (written or physical) has ever been uncovered to support these assertions.|$|E

500|$|On January 25, 1967, the Apollo 1 crew began {{a series}} of {{countdown}} tests in the spacecraft on the pad at Cape Kennedy. Although Shea had ordered his staff to direct North American to take action on the issue of flammable materials in the cabin, he had not supervised the issue directly, and little if any action had been taken. During pad testing, the spacecraft suffered a number of technical problems, including broken and static-filled communications. Wally Schirra, the backup commander for the mission, suggested to Shea that he should go through the countdown test in the spacecraft with the crew in order to experience first-hand the issues that they were facing. Although Shea seriously considered the idea, it proved to be unworkable because of the difficulties of hooking up a fourth communications loop for Shea. The hatch would have to be left open in order to run the extra wires out, and leaving the hatch open would make it impossible to run the <b>emergency</b> <b>egress</b> test that had been scheduled {{for the end of the}} day on the 27th. As Shea later told the press, joining the crew for the test [...] "would have been highly irregular".|$|E
500|$|In 2012, the RAF's Merlin HC3/3A fleet {{began to}} be {{transferred}} to the Royal Navy for use by the Commando Helicopter Force. [...] Royal Navy personnel worked alongside RAF crew at Benson to build experience during the transition. A £454m Merlin Life Sustainment Programme will see 25 HC3/3A airframes fitted with the cockpit electronics of the HM2, folding tails and main rotor heads, strengthened landing gear, deck lashing mounting points, obsolescence updates, fast-roping points and a common <b>emergency</b> <b>egress</b> system. The first HC4 is to begin flight trials in September 2017, with an IOC in mid-2018; an interim folding main rotor head will be fitted to some HC3 for shipborne operations prior to the HC4 upgrade. [...] Command of the UK Merlin HC3/3A fleet was formally transferred from the RAF to the Royal Navy during a ceremony at RAF Benson on 30 September 2014. [...] As part of the same ceremony, the RAF's 78 Sqn was disbanded and the Royal Navy's 846 Naval Air Squadron stood-up with the Merlin. [...] The RAF's 28(AC) continued to operate as part of the Commando Helicopter Force until July 2015, when 28(AC) Sqn stood down and 845 Naval Air Squadron stood-up. 846 NAS relocated from RAF Benson to RNAS Yeovilton in March 2015, with 845 NAS following in June 2016.|$|E

Four {{weeks after the}} September 11, 2001 attacks, the first of Raisbeck's prototype Hardened Cockpit Security System was installed. Alaska Airlines, American Trans Air and other airlines operating the Boeing 737 immediately ordered and took delivery of the cockpit doors. The doors included rapid decompression, <b>emergency</b> pilot <b>egress</b> and crash-crew cockpit ingress, bulletproof protection, cockpit-to-cabin visual identification and structural integrity.

[...] The agency refused to approve the blast shield, the hydraulic bollards on 10th Street, or the emplacement of benches, planters, and bollards around the perimeter. [...] NCPC said that real security could only be achieved by dismantling the section of the North Building which extended over 10th Street SW.|$|E

50|$|At first, the United States Air Force {{intended}} the conversion {{to be an}} easy matter of removing the carrier-specific features, so no prototypes were ordered, just five pre-production RB-66A models (the reconnaissance mission being considered a high priority). The list of modifications grew, and before long, the supposedly easy conversion became what was substantially a new aircraft. Many of the changes were due to the USAF's requirement for low-level operations, while the Navy version had originally been designed and employed as a high-altitude nuclear strike bomber. Two major differences between the A-3 and the B-66 consisted in the types of jet engines used, and the <b>emergency</b> crew <b>egress</b> systems.

40|$|<b>Emergency</b> {{evacuation}} (<b>egress)</b> {{is considered}} one of the most important issues in the design of buildings and public facilities. Given the complexity and variability in an evacuation situation, computational simulation tool is often used to help assess the performance of an egress design. Studies have revealed that social behaviors can have significant influence on the evacuating crowd during an emergency. Among the challenges in designing safe egress thus include identifying the social behaviors and incorporating them in the design analysis. Even though many egress simulation tools now exist, realistic human and social behaviors commonly observed in emergency situations are not supported. This paper describes an egress simulation approach that incorporates research results from social science regarding human and social behaviors observed in emergency situations. By integrating the behavioral theories proposed by social scientists, the simulation tool can potentially produce more realistic predications than current tools which heavily rely on simplified and, in most cases, mathematical assumptions...|$|R
