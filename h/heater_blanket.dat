40|$|Carbon-fibre/bismaleimide (BMI) {{composite}} joints were manufactured using {{resistive heating}} of {{a stainless steel}} mesh embedded between two layers of structural adhesive. In comparison with joints cured thermally, electrically cured joints achieved similar shear strengths. The surface treatment of the stainless steel mesh was critical in achieving satisfactory shear strength. The electrical curing process {{has been shown to}} be adaptable to field repairs of composite structures through the use of a modified low voltage AC power supply, traditionally used with <b>heater</b> <b>blanket</b> technology. The embedded mesh curing technique might obviate problems associated with achieving even, through thickness heating of composite structure during bonding of scarf and doubler repairs...|$|E
40|$|Repair {{techniques}} play {{an important}} role in increasing the useful life of the aerospace structures. They increase the confidence level of the user and promote the application of composites. Among the various repair techniques, hot bonding is widely acclaimed for its ability to restore the strength close to the original values. It is used for the repair of metal or composites structures. Hot bonding performed using flexible <b>heater</b> <b>blanket</b> and vacuum bag is the most suitable method for in-situ repair. Hot bonding is performed through elevated temperature cured adhesive system, which increases the glass transition temperature and hence the service temperature of the final product. These adhesive systems are sensitive to temperature gradient. If the gradient exceeds ± 5 oC, the cross-linking process and the quality of repair is adversely affected. In the hot bonding process, only the repair area is heated and the rest of the part is left in atmospheric condition. Due to partial heating, the region below the centre of the heater gets hotter than the surrounding. This problem worsens if the job has skin and spar construction or has non-uniform cross-section as in the case of aircraft control surfaces or windmill blades. The hot bonding equipment currently being imported (none manufactured within India) does not ensure temperature uniformity. This paper discusses the design and development aspects of multi-zone, portable hot bonding equipment, which overcome the above problems. Multiple numbers of appropriately placed heater blankets, sensors and a data acquisition device coupled with a novel control algorithm and multi-threaded software has resulted in the portable and reliable hot bonder. The equipment was tested on typical aircraft parts, such as an aluminium rudder and a composites fin tip. The conventional single <b>heater</b> <b>blanket</b> method has resulted in a temperature gradient of over 12 oC, while this product has limited the temperature gradient to within ± 1. 5 oC...|$|E
40|$|During {{the highly}} maneuverable {{aircraft}} technology (HiMAT) flight test program recently completed at NASA Ames Research Center's Dryden Flight Research Facility, numerous problems were experienced in airspeed calibration. This necessitated {{the use of}} state reconstruction techniques {{to arrive at a}} position-error calibration. For the HiMAT aircraft, most of the calibration effort was expended on flights in which the air data pressure transducers were not performing accurately. Following discovery of this problem, the air data transducers of both aircraft were wrapped in <b>heater</b> <b>blankets</b> to correct the problem. Additional calibration flights were performed, and from the resulting data a satisfactory position-error calibration was obtained. This calibration and data obtained before installation of the <b>heater</b> <b>blankets</b> were used to develop an alternate calibration method. The alternate approach took advantage of high-quality inertial data that was readily available. A linearized Kalman filter (LKF) was used to reconstruct the aircraft's wind-relative trajectory; the trajectory was then used to separate transducer measurement errors from the aircraft position error. This calibration method is accurate and inexpensive. The LKF technique has an inherent advantage of requiring that no flight maneuvers be specially designed for airspeed calibrations. It is of particular use when the measurements of the wind-relative quantities are suspected to have transducer-related errors...|$|R
40|$|TCS) {{experiment}} was upgraded [TCS Upgrade (TCSU) ] {{to provide an}} ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environment with modern discharge cleaning and wall-coating technolo-gies. This has allowed rotating magnetic field formed field reversed configuration plasma temperatures to in-crease from the TCS radiation-dominated tens of elec-tron volts to 200 eV (TeTi), and FRC magnetic fields to double. The improvements are directly attributable to reduced impurity levels and reduced plasma recycling losses. Some of the technologies utilized to achieve these results included replacing O-rings with wire and conflat seals; developing high-temperature, differentially pumped, elastomeric seals for bonding extremely large quartz tubes (needed for rapid field penetration) to the stainless steel vacuum chambers; and using <b>heater</b> <b>blankets</b> for vacuum baking. Extensive testing using electron microprobe and various spectroscopic techniques was performed to es-tablish appropriate UHV cleaning and handling methods...|$|R
50|$|On September 24, 2005, Hurricane Rita came ashore over Sabine Lake—the surge {{from the}} storm {{destroyed}} more than 90% of the structures in Sabine Pass. In February 2006, the team from Extreme Makeover: Home Edition (EM: HE) visited the town and rebuilt the Firehouse (which included a new Firetruck worth $400,000), the High School Auditorium and gave dozens of families $350 gift cards from Sears to replace items such as clothes, space <b>heaters,</b> <b>blankets</b> etc., lost due to Hurricane Rita. This town was featured in the EM:HE - After The Storm Texas Special which aired on the ABC on April 14, 2006.

40|$|A {{final stage}} in the {{manufacturing}} of a rotorcraft structural article is presented. A single-part composite skin is stiffened {{with a series of}} pre-cured composite frames. Legacy designs feature either mechanically fastened metallic skin and frames, or longitudinally split composite skin bonded and fastened to composite frames. In the new design, all frames are simultaneously bonded using a high-performance, thermally-activated film adhesive. No fasteners are used. This approach improved the load transfer, damage tolerance, and part count. The success of this complex bonding operation is highly dependent on the control of the process parameters, mainly the bondline temperature. Required temperature uniformity across all bondlines was achieved by independently controlled conductive Heat Transfer Tiles (HTT's) dedicated to each frame. The National Research Council's HTT technology delivers nonuniform heat flux based on variable thermal boundary conditions which results in improved temperature uniformity compared to traditional <b>heater</b> <b>blankets.</b> Custom HTTs, control system and fixturing were evaluated and used to manufacture seven test articles. The success of the exercise was confirmed by process data, non-destructive, destructive, and full-scale testing. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

40|$|The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) {{project had}} a rapid {{development}} schedule starting with project conception in spring of 2004, instrument and launch vehicle selection late in 2005 and then launch in early 2009. The lunar thermal environment {{is one of}} the harshest in our solar system with the heavy infrared loading of the moon due to low albedo, lack of lunar atmosphere, and low effective regolith conduction. This set of constraints required a thermal design which maximized performance (minimized radiator area and cold control heater power) and minimized thermal hardware build at the orbiter level (<b>blanketing,</b> and <b>heater</b> service). The orbiter design located most of the avionics on an isothermalized heat pipe panel called the IsoThermal Panel (ITP). The ITP was coupled by dual bore heat pipes to an Optical Solar Reflector (OSR) covered heat pipe radiator. By coupling all of the avionics to one system, the hardware was simplified. The seven instruments were mainly heritage instruments which resulted in their desired radiators being located by their heritage design. This minimized instrument redesigns and therefore allowed them to be delivered earlier, though it resulted in a more complex orbiter level <b>blanket</b> and <b>heater</b> service design. Three of the instruments were mounted on a tight pointing M 55 J optical bench that needed to be covered in heaters to maintain pointing. Two were mounted to spacecraft controlled radiators. One was mounted to the ITP Dual Bores. The last was mounted directly to the bus structure on the moon facing panel. The propulsion system utilized four- 20 pound insertion thrusters and eight- 5 pound attitude control thrusters (ACS) in addition to 1000 kg of fuel in two large tanks. The propulsion system had a heater cylinder and a heated mounting deck for the insertion thrusters which coupled most of the propulsion design together simplifying the heater design. The High Gain Antenna System (HGAS) and Solar Array System (SAS) used dual axis actuator gimbal systems. HGAS required additional boom heaters to cool the approximately 10 W of RF losses thru the rotary joints and wave guides from the 40 W Ka system. By design this module needed a fair amount of <b>heater,</b> <b>blanketing,</b> and radiator complexity. The SAS system required a separate cable wrap radiator to help cool the Solar Array harness which dissipated 30 W thru the actuators and cable wraps. This module also was complex...|$|R
40|$|Home {{electrical}} appliances release {{hazardous chemical}} substances produced by the effects of heating during their operation. The present study investigated the emission rates of chemical substances on home electrical appliances such as microwave ovens, vacuum cleaners, electric <b>heaters,</b> electric <b>blankets,</b> multimedia players, electronic dictionaries, MD players and notebook PCs. The VOCs emission rates of comparatively small products were measured using a small-scale environmental chamber with a volume of 0. 065 [m 3]. Toluene {{was found to be}} emitted from all samples, at rates of 0. 15 to 9. 5 [μg/h・unit]. In a previous study, increased chemical substance emission rates were detected during the operation of electrical space heaters, but in the present study no such increase was detected in any of the electrical appliances studied, except for the notebook PC. For comparatively large products, measurements were conducted using a large-scale environmental chamber with a volume of 4. 98 [m 3]. The VOCs concentrations in this chamber rose during operation for all products. The emission rates of total VOCs ranged from 9. 3 to 2600 [μg/h・unit].

40|$|The {{dimensionless}} parameters {{associated with}} the thermal stratification and pressure history of a heated container of liquid and its vapor were examined. The Modified Grashof number, the Fourier number, and an Interface number were parameterized using a single test liquid, Freon 113. Cylindrical test tanks with spherical dome end caps were built. <b>Blanket</b> <b>heaters</b> covered the tanks and thermocouples monitored the temperatures of the liquid, the ullage, the tank walls, and the foam insulation encapsulating the tank. A centrifuge {{was used for the}} 6 inch tank to preserve the same scaling parameter values between it and the larger tanks. Tests were conducted over a range of Gr* values and the degree of scaling was checked by comparing the dimensionless pressures and temperatures for each scaled pair of tests.

Some deviation was, however, found in the detailed temperature profiles between the scaled pairs of tests...|$|R
5000|$|The album's sound {{had a lot}} to do {{with the}} environment, {{according}} to its author: [...] What I like is when sound textures interweave and some come in and out like waves. But I am not going to go ‘ocean’ because that doesn’t suit my whole Wisconsin perspective. I usually record in the winter because I am holed up. It's cold outside but warm inside with the <b>heater</b> and <b>blankets.</b> A lot of the songs are cold but in the coldness you find warmth. Winter has a lot to do with it. Being from the Midwest, you experience a lot of harsh climat. Living in the country, there are a lot of harsh realities that teach you how to deal with things. Some argued that the inclusion of the two earlier singles' material illustrated the development of the Zola Jesus sound. [...] "The earlier singles are dirtier, sexier, more intense... Her voice, really, is the soul and core of the music," [...] and on The Spoils she used [...] "more reverb and single vocal tracks. I've never observed the loss of warmth and charm when switching to digital recording from analogue more apparently than here," [...] remarked a Brainwashed reviewer. [...] "I love weird power electronics and industrial music, but then I also really love intensely powerful melodic songs. Something like a Ronettes song hits you in such a different way than noise stuff. For me, the ideal is bringing both the experimental and the pop music in," [...] Zola Jesus commented, noting that percussion played an important role in the album's structure too.

5000|$|The series {{finale of}} Dinosaurs, titled [...] "Changing Nature", depicts the irresponsible {{actions of the}} dinosaurs toward their environment, and the ensuing Ice Age which leads to their demise. In the episode, a swarm of Bunch Beetles are unable {{to show up and}} devour a form of creeper vine. Charlene discovers that WESAYSO has {{constructed}} a wax fruit factory called FruitCo on the swampland that serves as the Bunch Beetles' breeding grounds, causing the extinction of the species (save for one male named Stan). Fearing a public relations fiasco more than any environmental threat, WESAYSO quickly puts Earl in charge of an attempt to destroy the vines, which have grown out of control without the beetles to keep them in check. Earl proposes spraying the planet with defoliant, which causes the destruction of the vines, but also kills off all plant life on the planet. B.P. Richfield assumes that the creation of clouds will bring rain, allowing the plants to grow back, and so decides to create clouds by dropping bombs in the planet's volcanoes to cause eruptions and cloud cover. The dark clouds instead cause global cooling, {{in the form of a}} gigantic cloud-cover simulating the effects of what the viewer would recognize as nuclear winter that scientists estimate would take [...] "tens of thousands of years" [...] to dissipate. B.P.

40|$|MASCOT is a lander {{built by}} DLR, {{embarked}} on JAXA’s Hayabusa- 2, a scientific mission {{to study the}} asteroid 162173 1999 JU 3. It is a small lander, less than 300 x 300 x 200 mm?, with onboard payloads (camera, magnetometer, radiometer and IR spectrometer), developed in collaboration by DLR and CNES. MASCOT lands on the asteroid surface, after being released by Hayabusa- 2 from a very close position above the asteroid surface, and investigates the asteroid surface. The thermal design of the lander {{represents one of the}} main challenges in the whole project because of multiple constraints, depending on the mission phase, mass, power and free space available. MASCOT, notwithstanding its small size, is equipped with redundant heat-pipe system, MLI <b>blanket,</b> <b>heaters.</b> The thermal design of the lander has been chosen after a trade-off phase concerning the technology which could suit better the opposing requirements of the mission: low heat exchange between the lander and the exterior (including the main spacecraft) in cruise, possibility to transfer all the heat dissipated by the internal paylaods and electronic boards during operations on asteroid surface. After selecting the heat-pipe technology as baseline, a development phase was undertaken by the partners both in terms of manufacturing, testing, thermal characterization phase and analitical modelling in order to match the thermal requirements. Heaters are used to assure the survival of the most delicated parts of the lander during cold cruise phases: the battery cells (only primary battery on-board), the electronic boards and the main payload. Strict requirements are given by the main spacecraft in terms of maximum power available to heat the lander during cruise. MLI blankets are used where the available space allows it, e. g. to extra insulate the Ebox {{from the rest of the}} lander creating a „hot compartment" and between the lander and the main spacecraft to reduce the heat exchange with it during cruise below the given limits.
