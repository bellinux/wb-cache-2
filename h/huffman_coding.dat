In particular, Tagged <b>Huffman</b> <b>Code</b> by Moura et al. offers fast direct searching on the compressed text and random access capabilities, in exchange for producing around 11 % larger compressed files. This work describes End-Tagged Dense Code and (s, c) -Dense Code, two new semistatic statistical methods for compressing natural language texts. These techniques permit simpler and faster encoding and obtain better compression ratios than Tagged <b>Huffman</b> <b>Code,</b> while maintaining its fast direct search and random access capabilities. We show that Dense <b>Codes</b> improve Tagged <b>Huffman</b> <b>Code</b> compression ratio by about 10 %, reaching only 0. 6 % overhead over the optimal Huffman compression ratio.
