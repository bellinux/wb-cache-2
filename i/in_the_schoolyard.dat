Bart rolls out the first issue of Angry Dad, which becomes a hit with the kids in school. During an autograph signing session <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>schoolyard,</b> Bart is approached by a spokesman for an Internet entertainment site. He wants to make Angry Dad into an online animated cartoon series, and Bart agrees in exchange for stock. The cartoon becomes an Internet hit, becoming the single most popular non-pornographic website of all time. The only one still unaware of Angry Dad is Homer, who finds out one day at work. Once the humiliated Homer gets home, he finds Bart and strangles him. Marge and Lisa stops him and calms him down, and Homer agrees to suppress his anger from that point on.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to study qualitatively and quantitatively the thermal {{perception}} and corresponding heat stress conditions that prevail in two schoolyards in a coastal city in central Greece. For this purpose, meteorological parameters (i. e., wind speed, temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation) were recorded at 70 and 55 measuring points <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>schoolyards,</b> from 14 : 00 to 15 : 30 local time, during May and June of 2011. The measuring points were distributed so as to get measurements at points (a) directly exposed to the sun, (b) under the shadow of trees and building structures, and (c) near building structures. Cluster analysis was applied to group observations and revealed places that are microclimatically homogeneous. Thermal perception and heat stress conditions were assessed by means of the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET, °C), and the results are presented <b>in</b> relevant charts. <b>The</b> impact of material’s albedo, radiation’s reflection by structures and obstacles, and different tree species on thermal perception and heat stress conditions was also assessed. The analysis showed that trees triggered a reduction of incident solar radiation that ranged between 79 and 94 % depending on tree’s species, crown dimension, tree height, and leaf area. PET values were mainly affected by solar radiation and wind speed. Trees caused a reduction of up to 37 % in PET values, while a 1 -m s− 1 increase in wind speed triggered a reduction of 3. 7 – 5. 0 °C <b>in</b> PET value. <b>The</b> effective shading area <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two <b>schoolyards</b> was small, being 27. 5 and 11 %. The results of this study could be exploited by urban planning managers when designing or improving the outdoor environment of a school complex. © 2015 IS...|$|R
50|$|Based on {{the white}} {{supremacist}} idea of “awakening people {{to the reality of}} race”, Heritage Front members believe themselves to be revolutionaries with the duty of creating a new and racially pure society. Heritage Front is primarily an activist organization that organizes white supremacist activities. The following quote from the journal Patterns of Prejudice describes how Heritage Front functions:“Front broadcasts oppressive messages on its hate lines. It physically fights with anti-racists on the streets. It harasses people of colour. It celebrates Aryan fests along with other racists. And, in addition, it has a presence at international conferences, creates and disseminates racist posters and flyers, mounts White Power concerts, recruits <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>schoolyards,</b> brings <b>in</b> speakers like Tom Metzger, meets with white-supremacist and nationalist leaders throughout the world, networks with other groups on the radical right, publishes a magazine, and posts articles and messages on its website.”One of the key goals of Heritage Front is to unite far right organizations and people. As such, it keeps close ties with other white supremacist groups such as Aryan Nations, the Church of the Creator, and the Ku Klux Klan.|$|R

40|$|The UHI {{phenomenon}} is affecting {{cities around the}} world and can be mitigated through several strategies both at the macro and at micro urban scale. These mitigation measures help to assess both the UHI reduction and the improvement of users' thermal comfort. This study is focused on the application of these strategies on schoolyards, which represent an interesting and effective site where to intervene. In Italy schoolyards are often public spaces widely distributed throughout the city and the amelioration of their microclimate conditions represent an important opportunity to improve both the children health, being children particularly sensitive to heat waves, and the social, educational and cultural values of <b>the</b> site. Moreover <b>schoolyards</b> can play an important role concerning the consciousness of the younger generation on environmental issues. A case study, consisting in three elementary schools and a middle school, located in Collegno, a town <b>in</b> <b>the</b> suburban area of Turin (north-west of Italy), was used to test the methodology to be followed in order to identify feasible solutions and assess their impact. In order to identify the critical areas inside the yards, and thus the mitigation strategies, the existing conditions were analysed through microclimate simulations performed with the software ENVI-met® v. 4 Technical Preview III. The evaluations were carried out for a hot summer day, assuming as starting input the values taken from the nearest meteorological station. In parallel, due to the important social value of these spaces, a sociological investigation was carried out with the aim of identifying the solutions through a participatory process. The intervention proposals were hence simulated and results in terms of air temperatures, surface temperatures, and PET index, were compared with the values obtained for the existing conditions. Moreover simulated surface temperatures related to the existing conditions were compared with <b>the</b> values measured <b>in</b> situ with a thermal imaging camera in order to validate the results. According to the sociological analysis, the evaluated intervention strategies included the maintenance of the vegetated areas and the use of "cool" coloured coatings with high solar reflectance index for the hard surfaces like the asphalted basketball courts commonly used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>schoolyards.</b> <b>The</b> simulations' results confirmed that the climate conditions inside <b>the</b> <b>schoolyards</b> can be noticeably improved using these strategies, and in particular, they showed that the highest effect were achieved, as expected, <b>in</b> lowering <b>the</b> surface temperatures...|$|R
40|$|To enable {{visually}} impaired students to attend regular schools, these students must not only have suitable monitoring, but must {{also be able to}} take part in all school activities without any major impediments. This means that the many existing barriers to this inclusion must neutralized or even eliminated. In addition to teaching barriers, there are also barriers concerning social aspects and the physical space. This articles focuses on spatial accessibility in schoolyards and shows that, when these environments disregard the needs of students - such as in terms of physical and cognitive needs - access can be made difficult or even impossible, limiting these individuals' performance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> physical space. Accordingly, it is necessary to identify <b>the</b> physical barriers <b>in</b> these environments before planning any spatial accessibility initiatives.

In many heteronormative school contexts family members were stigmatized and burdened by secrecy and fear about their family configuration. However, there were also a significant minority of family members who felt respected, supported and safe within the school environment.

The younger Sam started his education at Yarra Park State School, where he learned to bat, using a pine tree <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>schoolyard</b> as the stumps; the same tree {{was used for the}} same purpose years earlier by Test players Vernon Ransford and Ernie McCormick, and long-serving Victorian batsman Jack Ledward. The family moved to Armadale, and young Loxton attended Armadale Public School before completing his secondary education at Wesley College, Melbourne, an elite private boys’ school. One of his colleagues at Wesley College was Ian Johnson, a future teammate for Victoria and Australia. The boys’ school coach was P. L. Williams, a renowned mentor of teenagers who had earlier coached Ross Gregory and future Test captain Lindsay Hassett. Away from his sporting commitments at school, Loxton played district cricket for Prahran's third grade team when he was just 12. The young cricketer's parents were stalwarts of the club; Sam Sr. was the scorer and served as a transport man, driving the matting and equipment to matches, while Annie made cucumber sandwiches for 25 years—due to the economic difficulties caused by the Great Depression and World War II, meat catering for players was a luxury even at first-class and international matches. The elder Sam {{was a member of the}} club committee from 1941 until his death in 1974, and was a vice-president for the last 17 years of his life. At the age of 16, the younger Loxton was selected in the Victorian Cricket Association Colts team that played in the first grade competition in 1937–38; he played three seasons with the outfit, which was effectively a state youth team.

40|$|The article {{discusses}} aspects on children’s games. The opening overview {{concludes that}} while some old games such as ball games, chasing, swinging games etc, still are practiced <b>in</b> Swedish <b>schoolyards</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980 ´s, other have more or less disappeared, such as singing games. Among newer types of games the article discusses jump-rope games, “twist”-jumping games, and, in greater detail, {{a new type of}} clapping games with funny words and exciting rhythms that swept over Sweden <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980 ’s. It is concluded that these games show Afro-American characteristics; {{that at least some of}} them can be traced to the 1950 ’; that they were introduced  <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1980 ’s by girls of 8 to 13 years; and that they spread horizontally, from child to child, in institutional contexts, such as scout camps, riding camps, and schools. While to a certain degree the new clapping games build on old formulas and structures, most of them were considered new and clearly different from traditional Swedish games of the 1800 th and early 19 th century in Sweden. A reason for their fast spread and wide popularity is that they point towards the modern, urban and international, and especially to Afro-American popular culture. It is argued that yet another reason for the popularity of the new clapping games are that they are especially well adapted to the growing demands on children’s use of body, space and time, that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 70 ’s and 80 ’s became institutionalised in day-care settings, schools and camps. <b>In</b> conclusion, <b>the</b> author discusses clapping games as an example of globalisation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>schoolyards,</b> where they, together with pop music and film, constituted a not only a marked difference to older cultural forms, but also a symbol of thorough-going changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> life-worlds of Swedish school-children...|$|R

This was shown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first national survey on the prevention of overweight at Dutch secondary schools. The survey cited canteens and/or soda vending machines in almost 90 % of the schools, and candy dispensers in 77 %. More than half the schools described the food assortment as being primarily rich in calories. <b>In</b> most cases <b>the</b> school board can influence the food supplied to the schools: 60 % have an influence on food supplied in machines and 80 % have an influence on what is offered in canteens. Only one-quarter of the locations expected a positive change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following six months. The school environment can also be important: 75 % of schools are located near a supermarket, snack bar or petrol station. Pupils at about half the schools have access to these food facilities, since they are allowed to leave <b>the</b> <b>schoolyard</b> during school hours. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> lower classes most schools offer 3 - 4 hours a week of physical education, but 25 % of the capacity of the sport facilities is considered as being insufficient. <b>The</b> <b>schoolyard</b> itself offers possibilities for physical activity: pupils can walk <b>in</b> or around <b>the</b> <b>schoolyard</b> at 80 % of the schools and 40 % of the schools offer additional sport facilities on <b>the</b> <b>schoolyard.</b> Traffic circumstances around the school are considered to be average to very safe at 90 % of the schools.

Children's regular exposure to greenery in their home environment did not moderate the effect of <b>the</b> <b>schoolyard.</b> Also, <b>the</b> perception of <b>the</b> new <b>schoolyard</b> was highly positive and pupils as well as teachers are more inclined to use it than the old one. Implications for future research and design projects are discussed...|$|R
