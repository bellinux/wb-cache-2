5|$|In Glenfinnan, the Hogwarts Express crosses a viaduct, as <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past films. Aerial {{scenes were}} shot in Glen Coe, in Clachaig Gully, and Glen Etive, which, {{at the time}} of filming, {{was one of the few}} places in Scotland without snow, making it ideal for a backdrop.|$|E
5|$|The {{watershed}} of Abrahams Creek {{is continuing}} to become more developed, but at a slower rate than <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past. The lower reaches of the watershed are the most heavily urbanized, while the upper reaches are still largely rural. This {{has been the case}} as early 1893. The upper reaches of the watershed have a dendritic drainage system.|$|E
5|$|Locations in England {{included}} the River Thames, {{for the flight}} of the Order of the Phoenix to Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place, and the flight of Dumbledore's Army to the Ministry of Magic. This sequence also includes such landmarks as the London Eye, Canary Wharf, Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, and the HMS Belfast. Filming at Platform 9¾ took place at King's Cross Station, as <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past. A telephone booth near Scotland Yard was used as Harry and Arthur Weasley enter the Ministry, while the crew closed the Westminster tube station on 22 October 2006 to allow for filming of Arthur Weasley accompanying Harry to his trial at the Ministry of Magic. Other scenes were filmed in and around Oxford, specifically at nearby Blenheim Palace in Woodstock.|$|E

25|$|Though the Chabad {{movement}} {{was founded in}} Eastern Europe, a center of Ashkenazic Jewry, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past several decades attracted {{a significant number of}} Sephardi Jews as adherents. Some Chabad communities are now a mix of Ashkenazi and Sephardi Chabad Hasidim. In Montreal, close to 25% of Chabad households include a Sephardi parent.|$|E
25|$|Since {{a buffet}} {{involves}} diners serving themselves, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past been considered an informal form of dining, less formal than table service. In recent years, however, buffet meals are increasingly popular among hosts of home dinner parties, especially in homes where limited space complicates the serving of individual table places.|$|E
25|$|Hitchens {{argues that}} the human race no longer needs {{religion}} to the extent <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past. He says {{the time has come}} for science and reason to take a more prominent role in the life of individuals and larger cultures; that de-emphasizing religion will improve the quality of life of individuals, and assist the progress of civilization. It is in effect a rallying call to atheists to fight the theocratic encroachment on free society.|$|E
25|$|The Social Credit Party, led by Ernest C. Manning, won its eighth {{consecutive}} term in government, winning {{roughly the}} same number of seats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> legislature and share of popular vote that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1959 election.|$|R

25|$|Concerns {{have been}} raised about safety in {{operating}} the aircraft; there have been 337 fatalities from MU-2 crashes. As of October 2005, the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) undertook a safety evaluation of the aircraft. It concluded that the aircraft has met its certification requirements: It is safe when operated by properly trained pilots who operate properly maintained aircraft. The FAA {{is in the process}} of mandating training specific to the MU-2, as <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past for other aircraft. When such mandated training was required outside of the U.S., the MU-2 accident record was vastly improved.|$|E
25|$|Kuhn {{states that}} the {{probabilistic}} tools used by verificationists are inherently inadequate for the task of deciding between conflicting theories, since they belong to the very paradigms they seek to compare. Similarly, observations that are intended to falsify a statement will fall {{under one of the}} paradigms they are supposed to help compare, and will therefore also be inadequate for the task. According to Kuhn, the concept of falsifiability is unhelpful for understanding why and how science has developed as <b>it</b> <b>has.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> practice of science, scientists will only consider the possibility that a theory has been falsified if an alternative theory is available that they judge credible. If there is not, scientists will continue to adhere to the established conceptual framework. If a paradigm shift has occurred, the textbooks will be rewritten to state that the previous theory has been falsified.|$|E
500|$|The common {{blackbird}} {{was seen}} as a sacred though destructive bird in Classical Greek folklore, and was said to die if it consumed pomegranate. Like many other small birds, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past been trapped in rural areas at its night roosts as an easily available addition to the diet, and in medieval times the conceit of placing live birds under a pie crust just before serving may have been the origin of the familiar nursery rhyme: ...|$|E

50|$|Expeditionary {{warfare in}} Asia begun very much <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same way <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean with {{short-term}} raids by Japanese pirates.

2500|$|To {{help finance}} its policies, Scaddan's {{government}} introduced {{an income tax}} in 1912, and this was greatly increased after World War I broke out.

500|$|The {{seamount}} is {{populated by}} a large variety of deep-sea corals, most of which in turn provide a habitat for other species. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past been called [...] "An Oasis in the Deep", hosting a vast coral forest, large sponge field, crabs, deep-sea fish, basket stars, {{and a number of}} rare benthic species, some of which have yet to be studied properly or even named.

500|$|The durian is {{commonly}} known as the [...] "King of the Fruits", a label that can be attributed to its formidable look and overpowering odour. In its native southeastern Asia, the durian is an everyday food and portrayed in the local media in accordance with the cultural perception <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region. The durian symbolised the subjective nature of ugliness and beauty in Hong Kong director Fruit Chan's 2000 film Durian Durian (榴槤飄飄, lau lin piu piu), and was a nickname for the reckless but lovable protagonist of the eponymous Singaporean TV comedy Durian King played by Adrian Pang. Likewise, the oddly shaped Esplanade building in Singapore (Theatres on the Bay) is often called [...] "The Durian" [...] by locals, and [...] "The Big Durian" [...] is the nickname of Jakarta, Indonesia.|$|E
500|$|On January 20 {{that year}} the Soviets {{announced}} that their oil specialists would be withdrawn within a seven- to ten-day period. The Albanians later {{claimed that the}} specialists had sabotaged Albania's oil installations before departing. [...] Although Khrushchev had symbolically delivered blueprints for the Palace of Culture of Tirana {{on the occasion of}} his 1959 visit, all Soviet construction efforts on it ceased by April 1961. A shipment of materials for the Palace, which arrived in Durrës, was [...] "withdrawn at once on the pretext that the materials 'had been loaded by mistake and were not really intended for Albania.'" [...] On April 23 a Sino–Albanian trade agreement was concluded; Soviet First Deputy Premier Alexei Kosygin sent a letter five days later which effectively signaled an end to Soviet–Albanian trade agreements. Among other things it stated that [...] "It is understandable that the Albanian leadership cannot expect in the future that the USSR will help it as <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past, with aid from which only true friends and brothers have a right to benefit." [...] On August 19 the Soviet ambassador to Albania left Tirana [...] "and was never to return." [...] On August 26, [...] "only five days before the beginning of the fall semester," [...] the Soviets canceled scholarships for Albanian students studying in the USSR; these students given a deadline to leave by October. An Albanian account of the economy during this period states that, [...] "The foreign specialists left unfinished about 40 important objects of the 2nd Five-year Plan in the industrial sector alone. Difficulties increased even more after the cessation of military aid. Thus {{in the first years of}} the 3rd Five-year Plan the fulfillment of the plan in many sectors of the economy was made very difficult and to a certain extent the development of the Albanian economy as a whole was impaired." ...|$|E

50|$|In 1909 Herbert Henry Asquith's Royal Advisory Committee on Aeronautics was established, and Lanchester was {{appointed}} a member.

2500|$|... 'Yes to the EU' {{does not}} mean we are content with the union {{continuing}} to operate as <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past. There is a huge democratic deficit in its functioning, a serious bias towards the interests of neoliberalism and 'the market', and central institutions have been overbuilt. But to achieve those reforms {{we need to work}} with fellow EU members, not try to dictate high handedly to them, as David Cameron has done.|$|E
2500|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past been {{proposed}} to use higher enrichments for IRIS, allowing a longer cycle life, but the design now calls for 4.95% enriched Uranium, {{which is the}} same as what is being used in current plants.
