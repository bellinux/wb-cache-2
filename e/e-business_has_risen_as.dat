50|$|Quinalow was {{affected}} by the 2010-2011 Queensland floods. Rising floodwaters isolated the town, surrounding the Quinalow pub. Myall Creek was not thought to <b>have</b> <b>risen</b> <b>as</b> high {{as it did in}} the 1981 flood.|$|R
50|$|Green {{started as}} a youth player with Bradford City, before being signed by Everton in October 2011 for an initial fee of £300,000 that could <b>have</b> <b>risen</b> <b>as</b> high as £2 million and {{received}} a £45,000 signing-on fee. He joined the club's youth setup, {{and was a member}} of the side that won the 2014 U18 Premier League.|$|R
50|$|Haunted attractions are {{entertainment}} venues {{designed to}} thrill and scare patrons. Most attractions are seasonal Halloween businesses that may include haunted houses, corn mazes, and hayrides, {{and the level}} of sophistication of the effects <b>has</b> <b>risen</b> <b>as</b> the industry <b>has</b> grown.|$|R
6000|$|... "Even {{though we}} <b>had</b> <b>risen</b> <b>as</b> early as did you, {{it would not}} have been wise for us to go forward, yet I am free to admit that it might have been more seemly had we opened our eyes before sunrise." ...|$|R
60|$|Poor Feemy's face fell, and she {{sat down}} on the chair from which she <b>had</b> <b>risen,</b> <b>as</b> if she <b>had</b> not {{strength}} to stand. Myles stood still, with his back to the fire, trying to look as if he were not disconcerted.|$|R
6000|$|But in June {{something}} primitively English {{was thoroughly}} upset; old Jolyon's {{sense of justice}} <b>had</b> <b>risen,</b> <b>as</b> it were, from bed. [...] "You come and sponge on us," [...] she said, [...] "and then abuse us. If you think that's playing the game, I don't." ...|$|R
6000|$|Harper <b>had</b> <b>risen</b> <b>as</b> {{the door}} opened, {{and there was}} a slight {{movement}} of one hand towards his pistols; but it was cool and instantly checked. He raised the hood of the cardinal, which had fallen over her features, and exclaimed, with some uneasiness,-- ...|$|R
60|$|The people <b>had</b> <b>risen</b> <b>as</b> {{the king}} entered. Again, {{the pieces of}} the guardsmen had snapped to present; but silence, intense and utter, reigned over the vast assembly. The only {{movement}} was the measured stride of the king as he advanced to claim his bride.|$|R
50|$|Bodies of water, {{fresh and}} saline, have been {{important}} sources of food for people {{for as long as}} we have existed. It should be no surprise that ancient villages were located at the water's edge. Since the last ice age sea level <b>has</b> <b>risen</b> <b>as</b> much as 400 feet (~120 meters).|$|R
5000|$|Now {{back in the}} studio, Dustin {{is working}} with Schmidt again on what is to become their second [...] "new-music" [...] record.

5000|$|In 2010, {{studies of}} the Pasargadae showed that {{groundwater}} levels in the area <b>had</b> <b>risen</b> <b>as</b> {{a result of the}} dam and lake. The higher groundwater levels and increased humidity were said to be directly affecting foundation failures and the forming of newer cracks in walls and platforms throughout the ruins.|$|R
60|$|How Bradley Headstone {{had been}} racked and riven {{in his mind}} since the quiet evening when by the river-side he <b>had</b> <b>risen,</b> <b>as</b> it were, out of {{the ashes of the}} Bargeman, none but he could have told. Not even he could have told, for such misery can only be felt.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the death}} of Guaicaipuro, Tamanaco <b>had</b> <b>risen</b> <b>as</b> the new leader of the Mariches and Quiriquires.

50|$|Since the ban and {{the change}} in economy, {{household}} income has improved {{by an average of}} 17%.

30|$|Cloud {{computing}} <b>has</b> <b>risen</b> <b>as</b> a new computing paradigm {{that brings}} unparalleled flexibility {{and access to}} shared and scalable computing resources. The increasing demand for data processing and storage in this digital world is leading a significant growth of data centers, the size of which has grown from 1000 ’s to a few hundred thousands servers [1].|$|R
30|$|Nor is {{this notion}} far-fetched. Skill levels in {{production}} and clerical occupations, {{as measured by}} the college employment or wage-bill share, <b>have</b> <b>risen</b> <b>as</b> employment in these occupations has declined (Autor et al. 2003). A plausible interpretation of this pattern is that educated workers have comparative advantage in the set of non-routine tasks in these occupations that remain.|$|R

2500|$|Today, the {{municipality}} of Otumba is in transition towards a more urban area. Crime rates <b>have</b> <b>risen</b> <b>as</b> {{well as the}} frustrations of the local populace.

60|$|A slight mist <b>had</b> <b>risen</b> <b>as</b> {{early as}} four o'clock on Saturday. By night-fall the {{atmosphere}} was a little dense, but the lamp-posts were still clearly visible {{at a distance of}} some feet, and nobody, accustomed to living in London, would have noticed anything much out of the common. It was not till Sunday morning that the fog proper really began.|$|R

50|$|In recent decades, declining {{forestry}} {{and fishing}} industries have hit Sointula hard. Its school-age population has shrunk, although housing prices <b>have</b> <b>risen</b> <b>as</b> owners {{from as far}} as California have bought homes as summer retreats.

50|$|Robert is now {{thought to}} have become abbot around 1148. His only major known {{achievement}} in office was {{the recovery of the}} Emstrey tithes: King Stephen directed their restitution to Shrewsbury.

5000|$|Another {{example of}} an {{emergent}} salt dome is at Onion Creek, Utah / Fisher Towers near Moab, Utah, U.S. These two images show a Cretaceous age salt body that <b>has</b> <b>risen</b> <b>as</b> a ridge through several hundred meters of overburden, predominantly sandstone. As the salt body rose, the overburden formed an anticline (arching upward along its center line) which fractured and eroded to expose the salt body.|$|R
50|$|While some {{development}} of heavy industry {{occurred in the}} 1960s and 1970s, the province remained largely a scenic tourist destination. Even the economic growth of the 1990s seemed to leave Guangxi behind. However, in recent years, {{there has been a}} growing amount of industrialization and increasing concentration on cash crops. Per capita GDP <b>has</b> <b>risen</b> <b>as</b> industries in Guangdong transfer production to comparatively lower-wage areas in Guangxi.|$|R
