40|$|Standard {{methods for}} calculating cartel-damages rely on data of prices charged and {{quantity}} sold. Such data may not easily be available. In this paper, it is {{shown that a}} lower bound for cartel-damages can also be computed <b>from</b> <b>accounting</b> data. In previous literature it is shown that economic profits can hardly be inferred <b>from</b> <b>accounting</b> data. Therefore, it is shown under which econometrically testable assumptions on accounting costs a meaningful lower bound for cartel damages can consistently be estimated <b>from</b> <b>accounting</b> data. An estimation of cartel-damages is performed for four vitamins producers that participated in the vitamins cartel. The results indicate that both the aggregation-level and the publication-frequency of accounting data pose {{a challenge to the}} estimation of cartel damages. A further challenge is to appropriately reflect the strength respectively effectiveness of the collusive agreement in the specification of any such estimation. ...|$|R
