50|$|Hexabromodiphenyl ether (hexaBDE) and <b>heptabromodiphenyl</b> <b>ether</b> (heptaBDE) are main {{components}} of commercial octabromodiphenyl ether (octaBDE). Commercial octaBDE is highly persistent in the environment, whose only degradation pathway is through debromination {{and the production}} of bromodiphenyl ethers, which can increase toxicity.|$|E
5000|$|Commercial octaBDE (also {{known as}} [...] "Octabrom") is a {{technical}} mixture of different PBDE congeners having {{an average of}} 7.2 to 7.7 bromine atoms per molecule of diphenyl ether. [...] The predominant congeners in commercial octaBDE are those of <b>heptabromodiphenyl</b> <b>ether</b> and octaBDE. The term octaBDE alone refers to isomers of octabromodiphenyl ether (PBDE congener numbers 194-205); the Infobox displays BDE-203 (2,2’,3,4,4’,5,5’,6-octabromodiphenyl ether).|$|E
40|$|AbstractTwo {{kinds of}} BFRs in three WEEE plastics(cell phone shells, {{computer}} housings and TV housings) and PCBs were detected with GC/MS. The results showed the plastics used as mobile phone shells had no BFRs. TBBPA was only found in computer housings. Among PBDEs, congeners of <b>heptabromodiphenyl</b> <b>ether,</b> octabromodiphenyl ether and nonabromodiphenyl ether were frequent ones, and detected in both TV housings and computer housings. But {{the contents of}} N 9 BDE were lower than the other two, only 180 mg/kg and 5. 3 mg/kg in computer housings and TV housings respectively, while pentabromodiphenyl ether and hexabromodiphenyl ether were determined in PCBs...|$|E
40|$|The thermal {{degradation}} of decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE- 209) featuring fully substituted bromines was investigated over an as-prepared Fe 3 O 4 micro/nano-material at 300 A degrees C. Degradation followed pseudo-first-order kinetics with k (obs) = 0. 15 min(- 1) {{higher than that}} for decachlorobiphenyl (CB- 209). Twenty-six newly produced polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners were identified using the available PBDE standards, while four PBDE congener products were predicted using third-order polynomial regression equation. Analysis of the products indicated that BDE- 209 underwent stepwise hydrodebromination over as-prepared Fe 3 O 4. Similar to the case for CB- 209, two initial hydrodebromination steps are favored at the BDE- 209 meta-positions, giving the major products BDE- 207 and BDE- 197. However, the variance about the preferred products began {{to emerge from the}} start of <b>heptabromodiphenyl</b> <b>ethers</b> (hepta-BDEs). The majorly produced hepta-BDE isomer with BDE- 183 is unbrominated at one ortho-position. However, this is different from the reported degradation of CB- 209, which always produced the products chlorinated at all four ortho-positions until the ortho-position had to be removed for the formation of trichlorobiphenyls and dichlorobiphenyl still majorly chlorinated at three or two ortho-positions. The early BDE- 209 hydrodebromination steps appear to be strongly influenced by steric effects, whereas subsequent hydrodebromination steps, as more bromine atoms are removed, will be gradually governed more by thermodynamics...|$|R
30|$|Industrial {{chemicals}} like {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} [PCBs], perfluorinated compounds [PFCs], and polybrominated diphenyl ethers [PBDEs] {{have been used}} in innumerable applications for many years. In recent years, however, it became clear that these compounds are by no means unproblematic when reaching the environment. Many of them are highly persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic. Furthermore, the substances themselves or their precursors are subject to long-range transport and have been detected in biota in remote areas like the Arctic and Antarctica (e.g., [1 – 16]). These findings led to the inclusion of PCBs, certain PBDEs (i.e., hexabromodiphenyl ether, <b>heptabromodiphenyl</b> <b>ether,</b> tetrabromodiphenyl ether, and pentabromo-diphenyl ether), as well as the PFCs' perfluorooctane sulfonic acid [PFOS] and its salts and perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride into the list of persistent organic pollutants [POPs] covered by the Stockholm Convention on POPs [17, 18]. Already 9 years earlier, in 2000, a voluntary phase-out of PFOS was initiated by its main producer 3 M. Others, like perfluorooctanoic acid [PFOA] are still under evaluation. In the European Union [EU], PCBs and technical Penta- and Octa-BDEs were banned already in 1985 and 2004, respectively [19, 20]. An EU-wide restriction of Deca-BDE followed in 2008 (curia.europa.eu; case C- 14 / 06).|$|E
40|$|The noncovalent {{interactions}} of 24 diversely structured hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (OH-PBDEs), ranging from hydroxylated monobromodiphenyl ether (OH-monoBDE) to hydroxylated octabromodiphenyl ether (OH-octaBDE), with bovine serum albumin (BSA) {{have been examined}} by employing an electrospray ionization source fitted on a quadrupole time-of-flight hybrid mass spectrometer equipped with a traveling wave ion mobility cell. The mass spectrometric parameters were finely optimized to favor the observation of noncovalent complexes. The experimental data confirm that due to the close structural resemblance with thyroid hormone thyroxine, some OH-PBDEs {{have been shown to}} conjugate with BSA. It is found that BSA preferentially interacts with one OH-octaBDE (4 '-OH-BDE- 201) and two hydroxylated <b>heptabromodiphenyl</b> <b>ether</b> (OH-heptaBDE) isomers (4 -OH-BDE- 187 and 6 -OH-BDE- 180) with 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 binding stoichiometries. The state of bound OH-PBDEs is inferred to be as both neutral and anionic species. The dissociation constants of corresponding noncovalent complexes are calculated by titration curve data fitting. Investigation into various OH-PBDE analogs demonstrates that both the degree of bromination and the positions of hydroxylation and bromine moieties may exert influence on the binding of OH-PBDEs to BSA. The possible conformational changes in BSA induced upon the binding of OH-PBDEs were explored by use of ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) to understand the details of the interactions in structural aspects.

30|$|PBDEs are {{extensively}} used {{in various}} types of electronic equipment, furniture, plastics, textiles, etc. due to their excellent flame retardant performance (Leonel et al. 2014). Since PBDEs can be easily incorporated into different materials and products without making any covalent bonds, they could transport and migrate to different environment through volatilization and effusion etc. (Kim et al. 2007). Therefore, PBDEs have become widespread environmental pollutants and are ubiquitous in the environment (Birgul et al. 2012). Due to their persistency, long-range environmental transport potential and bioaccumulation ability, four PBDE congeners (i.e. tetrabromodiphenyl ether, pentabromodiphenyl ether, hexabromodiphenyl ether and <b>heptabromodiphenyl</b> <b>ether)</b> have been listed as new persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in 2009 (Stockholm Convention 2009). Previous studies demonstrated that PBDEs have {{a wide range of}} toxicities, including cytotoxicity (An et al. 2011), developmental neurotoxicity (Costa et al. 2014), genotoxicity (Ji et al. 2011), disruption of thyroid functions (Xu et al. 2014), reproductive toxicity (Muirhead et al. 2006) and carcinogenicity (Zhao et al. 2015). Penta-BDEs are reported to be the most toxic compounds among the PBDEs congeners. Deca-BDEs received the least concern among PBDEs congeners on account of its relatively lower toxicity (Gandhi et al. 2011). However, the higher-brominated PBDEs congeners (hepta-BDEs to deca-BDEs) could be degraded/transformed to lower-brominated PBDEs congeners which seems to be more toxic in various environments such as soil, aquatic ecosystems (Huang et al. 2014). Therefore, PBDEs had posed a great threat to both human health and the global environment.|$|E
