5|$|On 15 November 1995, Martin {{announced}} he would appeal the sentence. He later dropped the appeal without giving an explanation on 4January 1996, four days before {{it was to have}} been <b>heard.</b> <b>He</b> turned down a subsequent chance to petition the President of Singapore for clemency, saying that he was impatient to be executed.|$|E
5|$|Phips {{arrived in}} London in early January, 1695. Upon {{his arrival in}} London, he was arrested on exaggerated charges, levied by Dudley, that he had conspired to {{withhold}} customs monies. Phips was bailed out by Sir Henry Ashurst but fell ill with a fever and died on February 18, 1695, aged 44, before his charges were <b>heard.</b> <b>He</b> was buried in London at the Church of St. Mary Woolnoth.|$|E
5|$|A {{town meeting}} is held to discuss Mr. Burns' actions. Mr. Burns arrives, {{armed with a}} gun after his {{encounter}} with Homer. Despite the whole town standing up to him, he activates the sun-blocking device, thinking himself invincible. He walks into an alley, obscured from view, and struggles with someone until a gunshot is <b>heard.</b> <b>He</b> stumbles out into the open, wounded, and collapses on the town's sundial. The townspeople find him and Marge tells all of them that since Mr. Burns has angered so many people recently, just about anyone {{could have been the}} shooter.|$|E

5|$|As a judge, Parker was {{notable for}} {{independently}} researching each {{case that he}} <b>heard.</b> <b>He</b> was {{generally considered to be}} pro-labor and was an active supporter of social reform legislation, for example upholding a maximum-hours law as constitutional. In the 1902 decision Roberson v. Rochester Folding Box Co, Parker found against a woman whose face had been used in advertisements without her permission, ruling that this use did not violate her common law privacy rights. The decision was unpopular in the press and led to the passage of a privacy law by the New York State Legislature the following year. In the same year, Parker upheld the death sentence given to convicted murderer Martha Place, who became the first woman to be executed by electric chair.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{as fast as}} he {{had been}} on the {{previous}} tour, Constantine was still capable of short bursts of very fast bowling. However, the slowness of the pitch reduced the effectiveness of the Bodyline tactics, and Constantine took one for 55; England's captain Douglas Jardine, who had implemented the Bodyline tactics in Australia, batted for five hours to score his only Test century. The public disapproval expressed during and after the match was instrumental in turning English attitudes against Bodyline, something Constantine considered hypocritical. In the West Indies' second innings Constantine's innings of 64 in an hour ensured that the match was drawn. Nelson initially agreed to release him for the third Test, with Essex all-rounder Stan Nichols to be Constantine's substitute for the club team. When Jardine <b>heard,</b> <b>he</b> convinced the England selectors to include Nichols in the England team for the Test, the deal collapsed and Constantine did not play. Most critics believed that the West Indies underachieved in the Test series; Constantine believed that one cause was the inadequacy of Grant as captain. In all first-class games on the tour Constantine scored 181 runs at 20.11 and took 14 wickets at 22.14.|$|E
5|$|Conley was cross-examined by {{the defense}} for 16 hours over three days, but the defense failed to break his story. The defense then moved to have Conley's entire {{testimony}} concerning the alleged rendezvous stricken from the record. Judge Roan noted that an early objection might have been upheld, but since the jury could not forget what it had <b>heard,</b> <b>he</b> allowed the evidence to stand. The prosecution, to support Frank's alleged expectation of a visit from Phagan, produced Helen Ferguson, a factory worker who first informed Phagan's parents of her death. Ferguson testified that {{she had tried to}} get Phagan's pay on Friday from Frank, but was told that Phagan would have to come in person. Both the person behind the pay window and the woman behind Ferguson in the pay line disputed this version of events, testifying that in accordance with his normal practice, Frank did not disburse pay that day.|$|E

5|$|In December 1483, Richard instituted what {{later became}} known as the Court of Requests, a court to which poor people who could not afford legal {{representation}} could apply for their grievances to be <b>heard.</b> <b>He</b> also improved bail in January 1484, to protect suspected felons from imprisonment before trial and to protect their property from seizure during that time. He founded the College of Arms in 1484, he banned restrictions on the printing and sale of books, and he ordered the translation of the written Laws and Statutes from the traditional French into English. He ended the arbitrary benevolences (a device by which Edward IV raised funds), made it punishable to conceal from a buyer of land that a part of the property had already been disposed of to somebody else, required that land sales be published, laid down property qualifications for jurors, restricted the abusive Courts of Piepowders, regulated cloth sales, instituted certain forms of trade protectionism, prohibited the sale of wine and oil in fraudulent measure, and prohibited fraudulent collection of clergy dues, among others. Churchill implies he improved the law of trusts.|$|E

In 246, {{following}} Dong Yun's death, Lü Yi replaced him as Prefect of the Masters of Writing (尚書令; i.e., {{the director of the}} imperial secretariat). During his tenure, he gained a reputation for efficiency: he dealt with important matters without delay, and quickly cleared the queues of officials with issues waiting to be <b>heard.</b> <b>He</b> died in 251.|$|E

Fats Waller was Wyeth's greatest influence, leading him to learn stride piano and music theory. He studied percussion with Alan Abel of the Philadelphia Orchestra, and received a bachelor's in music at Syracuse University in 1966.|$|E

Indeed, Agrippina fared much better in producing imperial heirs to the household (being {{the mother of the}} Emperor Caligula and Agrippina the Younger) and was much more popular. Suetonius reports that she despised her younger brother Claudius; having <b>heard</b> <b>he</b> would one day become Emperor, she deplored publicly such a fate for the Roman people.|$|E

Elisha sent a {{messenger}} to Naaman {{to tell him to}} wash seven times in the Jordan River and be healed, but that angered Naaman, who expected Elisha to come out, call on the name of God, and wave his hands over Naaman. Naaman asked whether the Amanah and Pharpar rivers of Damascus were not better than any river in Israel, so that he might wash in them and be clean.|$|E
25|$|From infancy, Rabbi Chaim Ozer {{was weak}} and sickly. However, he was gifted with a {{tremendous}} memory, never forgetting anything he had ever read or <b>heard.</b> <b>He</b> was also a deep thinker who developed clear explanations for every Torah topic he studied. At the age of 9, he was tested by Rabbi Yisroel Salanter, who asked the boy a question in halakha along with his own answer. The little Chaim Ozer refuted the Rav's thesis and cited a different one from the sources, astounding the Rav.|$|E

25|$|The maltreatment {{of cattle}} at the Smithfield Market {{prompted}} Elizabeth Heyrick in 1823 to publish anonymously a stinging rebuke to those acting cruelly {{as well as}} to what she perceived was an apparent lack of punitive action taken against the perpetrators. Heyrick's short work began with strong words directed at the supporters of Martin's Act for not prosecuting those who abused animals. However she seemed to be unaware that Broome had in 1822 already personally brought to court some individuals against whom charges of cruelty were <b>heard.</b> <b>He</b> also from his own pocket paid the salary for an inspector to monitor the abuse of animals at the Smithfield Market.|$|E
25|$|Despite some {{positive}} performances, including the historic 2–1 home victory against local rivals Newcastle United on 25 October (the {{first time the}} club had accomplished this in 28 years), as well as good showings by recent signings like Djibril Cissé and Anton Ferdinand, the team's general form remained inconsistent. By the end of November, Sunderland were 18th in the Premier League, having lost five of their six previous games. Keane stood down as manager on 4 December after bringing doubt on his own future with comments made {{in the wake of}} the 4–1 home defeat by Bolton Wanderers the previous weekend. Keane's harsh management style was not appreciated by the Sunderland players, who were reported to have celebrated when they <b>heard</b> <b>he</b> had resigned.|$|E
25|$|Fort Beauregard had not {{suffered}} punishment {{as severe}} as that given to Fort Walker, but Colonel Robert Gill Mills Dunovant was concerned that the enemy could easily cut off his only line of retreat. When the firing at Fort Walker ceased and cheering in the fleet was <b>heard,</b> <b>he</b> realized that his command was in peril. Rather than be trapped, he ordered the troops on Philip's Island to abandon their positions. This they did without destroying their stores, because {{to do so would}} have attracted the attention of the fleet. Their departure was not noted, and not until a probing attack by gunboat Seneca elicited no reply was it realized that the fort was unmanned. As it was then very late in the day, raising the Union flag on Fort Beauregard was delayed until the following morning.|$|E
