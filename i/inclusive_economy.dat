The {{design and}} {{management}} of a transparent, integrated, procurement system can provide opportunities to marginalized providers and clients outside of the global for-profit trade networks and support socially <b>inclusive</b> <b>economies.</b> The new public procurement system of the State of Oregon, USA, is a model for use by social policy entities. The Oregon system integrates: new statutes, rules and policies; web-based e-procurement technology; strategic sourcing, socio-economic programs for diversity, rehabilitation, inmates, client services, and sustainability; and delegated authority to designated procurement officers, the state’s chief procurement officer, and their delegatees, all of whom stay responsible. Integrated components support data-driven competition and monitoring for corruption. This flexible procurement system provides needed socio-economic opportunities and is adaptable for other users. ...|$|R

In 1911, Warbasse {{was a member of}} the [...] "Recruiting Local" [...] No. 174 of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). In the 1910s, he published essays on The Socialization of Medicine and Conserving Health versus Exploiting Disease.

In 1913 he wrote a pamphlet entitled The Ethics of Sabotage and aided textile mill strikers in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Warbasse founded the Cooperative League of the U.S.A. in New York City in 1916 with his wife Agnes, baker and author Alfred Sonnichsen and other progressive organizers. Warbasse, genuinely seeking a solution to the world's inequalities, ultimately rejected socialism, anarchism and radical unionism in favor of cooperative economics as the best model for creating an <b>inclusive</b> <b>economy</b> in the context of preserving personal freedom and political autonomy.|$|E

The barriers and opportunities for connecting the two spheres were also explored as well as possible ways in which such activities may be supported at different levels of organisation. In the case of South Africa, many informal green activities that contribute to sustainable livelihoods are recognised.

40|$|Over {{the last}} 20 years, {{the world economy}} has induced more {{competition}} and cooperation. To understand how cooperation is complementary to competition, the paper proposes to analyze {{both sides of the}} market economy: the competition side where agents compete with each other and the cooperation side where agents need to cooperate with each other. Despite a rising economic growth during the last thirty years, recent studies on happiness also show a gap between economic growth and life satisfaction (Eeasterlin, 1974, Helliwell, Layard and Sachs, 2016). This work seeks to study the conditions of a more <b>inclusive</b> <b>economy</b> allowing individuals and organizations to reach better efficiency and happiness. To realize this paradigmatic revolution, the paper suggests using the results of Shapiro and Stiglitz’s efficiency wage theory for investigating necessary conditions for a more <b>inclusive</b> <b>economy.</b> In an inclusive growth, two aspects must be analyzed: the long run sustainable happiness and efficiency specialization for agents and countries and their short run daily happiness and efficiency. In the first part, the paper analyzes how recent world changes evolve to use a complexity theory (Le Moigne, 1995) which proposes qualitative inter-dependences between rationality and emotion for reaching rising efficiency. In the second part, the paper demonstrates how the individual strategies of the agents, led by the search for increasing happiness, may induce some long run innovations for the whole society. In the last part, the paper proposes concrete short run actions for greater individual and collective happiness and efficiency. ...|$|E
40|$|The paper expands on the {{regional}} geographic {{dimensions of the}} <b>inclusive</b> <b>economy</b> outlined in Treasury Working Paper 01 / 15 Towards an <b>Inclusive</b> <b>Economy.</b> It discusses {{the extent to which}} differences in economic and social indicators across regions might constitute problems, illustrates the importance of understanding empirical patterns of deprivation in New Zealand and outlines some key policy directions. In some instances, differences in indicators of well-being between regions indicate positive dynamics, for example cities generate higher productivity and wages as well as consumption benefits. In other instances, regional differences may be problematic, for example when spillovers perpetuate social problems or people become stuck in declining areas. Auckland is important - it contains 36 % of all deprived neighbourhoods in New Zealand, and the proportion is growing over time. Rural deprived regions, particularly Northland and Gisborne with 24 % of their population living in deprived neighbourhoods, also warrant attention if people are stuck or community functioning is impaired. There is a high preponderance of Maori and Pacific peoples in both urban and rural deprived neighbourhoods. Avenues for policy exploration include education, enhancing connectedness, and ensuring that people are free to move to job-rich areas. Intervention in local economies needs to be selective and evaluation of all policy intervention is important. Policies that are spatially neutral may have unintended spatial effects and this also requires further attention. economic geography, spatial distribution, deprivation, regions, regional policy...|$|E
