500|$|As a subplot, Stan {{spends most}} of the episode trying to return the {{aforementioned}} Margaritaville mixer; the trendy retailer Sur La Table will not accept the return because it was bought on a payment plan. He tries to find out to whom he can return it, each person saying the debt has been packaged and sold to someone else (much like real-life mortgage-backed securities). Eventually he {{goes all the way}} to the United States Treasury, where a group of associates [...] "consult the charts" [...] and tell him the mixer is worth $90 trillion. One of the three treasury workers then says that another insurance company is failing and asks what they should <b>do.</b> <b>They</b> <b>say</b> they have to [...] "consult the charts" [...] again. Stan follows the men inside, and he sees a round lit-up game show style board, where the men cut off a chicken's head and let the decapitated chicken run on the board while one of them plays a tune similar to Yakety Sax on a kazoo. The chicken falls on the [...] "bailout!" [...] spot, so that is what the men do. In anger at the ridiculousness of the system, Stan breaks the mixer on the platform by the chicken and walks off.|$|E
