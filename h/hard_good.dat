The weather, on the riverside, was most {{dependable}} then, and there was always sufficient sunshine as an excuse for bringing out Madam's last new muslin gown, or her pale-coloured quilted petticoat. Then the ground was dry and <b>hard,</b> <b>good</b> alike for walking and for setting up tents and booths. And of these there was of a truth a most goodly array this year: mountebanks and jugglers from every corner of the world, so it seemed, for there was a man with a face as black as my lord's tricorne, and another with such flat yellow cheeks as made one think of batter pudding, and spring aconite, of eggs and other very yellow things.|$|E
6000|$|That a {{man should}} {{determine}} to devote himself {{to the service of}} humanity--including intellectual and moral self-culture under that name; that this should be, in the proper sense of the word, his religion--is not only an intelligible, but, I think, a laudable resolution. And I am greatly disposed to believe that it is the only religion which will prove itself to be unassailably acceptable so long as the human race endures. But when the Comtist asks me to worship [...] "Humanity"--that is to say, to adore the generalised conception of men as they ever have been and probably ever will be--I must reply that I could just as soon bow down and worship the generalised conception of a [...] "wilderness of apes." [...] Surely we are not going {{back to the days of}} Paganism, when individual men were deified, and the <b>hard</b> <b>good</b> sense of a dying Vepasian could prompt the bitter jest, [...] "Ut puto Deus fio." [...] No divinity doth hedge a modern man, be he even a sovereign ruler. Nor is there any one, except a municipal magistrate, who is officially declared worshipful.

6000|$|Little Doctor Prance, {{with her}} <b>hard</b> <b>good</b> sense, had noted {{that she was}} an√¶mic, and had intimated {{that she was a}} deceiver. The value of her {{performance}} was yet to be proved, but she was certainly very pale, white as women are who have that shade of red hair; they look as if their blood had gone into it. There was, however, something rich in the fairness of this young lady; she was strong and supple, there was colour in her lips and eyes, and her tresses, gathered into a complicated coil, seemed to glow with the brightness of her nature. She had curious, radiant, liquid eyes (their smile was a sort of reflexion, like the glisten of a gem), and though she was not tall, she appeared to spring up, and carried her head as if it reached rather high. Ransom would have thought she looked like an Oriental, if it were not that Orientals are dark; and if she had only had a goat she would have resembled Esmeralda, though he had but a vague recollection of who Esmeralda had been. She wore a light-brown dress, of a shape that struck him as fantastic, a yellow petticoat, and a large crimson sash fastened at the side; while round her neck, and falling low upon her flat young chest, she had a double chain of amber beads. It must be added that, in spite of her melodramatic appearance, there was no symptom that her performance, whatever it was, would be of a melodramatic character. She was very quiet now, at least (she had folded her big fan), and her father continued the mysterious process of calming her down. Ransom wondered whether he wouldn't put her to sleep; for some minutes her eyes had remained closed; he heard a lady near him, apparently familiar with phenomena of this class, remark that she was going off. As yet the exhibition was not exciting, though it was certainly pleasant to have such a pretty girl placed there before one, like a moving statue. Doctor Tarrant looked at no one as he stroked and soothed his daughter; his eyes wandered round the cornice of the room, and he grinned upward, as if at an imaginary gallery. [...] "Quietly--quietly," [...] he murmured from time to time. [...] "It will come, my good child, it will come. Just let it work--just let it gather. The spirit, you know; you've got to let the spirit come out when it will." [...] He threw up his arms at moments, to rid himself of the wings of his long waterproof, which fell forward over his hands. Basil Ransom noticed all these things, and noticed also, opposite, the waiting face of his cousin, fixed, from her sofa, upon the closed eyes of the young prophetess. He grew more impatient at last, not of the delay of the edifying voice (though some time had elapsed), but of Tarrant's grotesque manipulations, which he resented as much as if he himself had felt their touch, and which seemed a dishonour to the passive maiden. They made him nervous, they made him angry, and it was only afterwards that he asked himself wherein they concerned him, and whether even a carpet-bagger hadn't a right to do what he pleased with his daughter. It was a relief to him when Verena got up from her chair, with a movement which made Tarrant drop into the background as if his part were now over. She stood there with a quiet face, serious and sightless; then, after a short further delay, she began to speak.|$|E

40|$|The {{nitrogen}} {{ion implantation}} {{can be used}} to improve surface mechanical properties and corrosion resistance behavior of AISI 316 L stainless steels by modifying the near-surface layers of these materials. In this study, an AISI 316 L stainless steel plate was implanted with the optimum ion dose of 5 ÔÇ¥ 1016 ion/cm 2 for ion energy variation of 60, 80 and 100 keV. Microhardness was measured by Vickers method, and the results of measurements clearly indicate an enhancement hardness behavior for nitrogen implanted layer. It is found that the implanted layer hardness was increased by a factor of 1. 3 in comparison to that of the unimplanted samples. The increased hardness resulting from nitrogen ion implantation was attributed to the formation of an iron nitride phase. Microstructure, chemical composition and surface morphology studied using the technique of Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). Analysis of SEM-EDX micrographs and XRD diffraction patterns indicate that the nitrogen implanted layer is composed of a metastable single phase which has properties very <b>hard,</b> <b>good</b> corrosion resistance behavior and wear resistance surface layers of stainless steel components.
