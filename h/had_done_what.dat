5|$|Alsos teams {{rounded up}} German {{scientists}} including Kurt Diebner, Otto Hahn, Walther Gerlach, Werner Heisenberg, and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, who {{were taken to}} England where they were interned at Farm Hall, a bugged house in Godmanchester. After the bombs were detonated in Japan, the Germans were forced to confront {{the fact that the}} Allies <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>what</b> they could not.|$|E
5|$|On Saturday night, Max Mayfield, {{director}} of the National Hurricane Center, did something he had done only once before. He called the governors of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi to warn them {{of the severity of}} the coming storm. He issued a special warning to Mayor Ray Nagin, telling him that some levees in the greater New Orleans area could be overtopped. Later, Mr. Mayfield would tell Brian Williams with NBC Nightly News that he went to bed that night believing he <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>what</b> he could. On Sunday, he made a video call to U.S. President George W. Bush at his farm in Crawford, Texas about the severity of the storm.|$|E
5|$|The courts {{eventually}} {{decided the}} Warner Bros. lawsuit in Cagney's favor. He <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>what</b> many thought unthinkable: {{taking on the}} studios and winning. Not only did he win, but Warner Bros. also {{knew that he was}} still their foremost box office draw and invited him back for a five-year, $150,000-a-film deal, with no more than two pictures a year. Cagney also had full say over what films he did and did not make. Additionally, William Cagney was guaranteed the position of assistant producer for the movies in which his brother starred.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1992, Kosar's {{physical}} decline {{had long}} been apparent to Belichick, which left the coach with a difficult choice. Kosar was Cleveland's most popular athlete, a hometown boy who had forgone big money and a bigger profile to lead a struggling team back to the top. While he recognized {{it would be an}} unpopular decision, Belichick wanted to bench Kosar, and in 1992 the team picked up a potential replacement in Vinny Testaverde from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Belichick named Kosar the starter before the 1993 season, but in the third game against the Raiders, Belichick pulled Kosar after he threw his third interception of the night. Taking over with Los Angeles ahead 13–0, Testaverde led two touchdown drives to win the game. Two weeks later, Belichick named Testaverde the starter. On the verge of tears after a loss to the Dolphins, Kosar said he was disappointed with the decision and felt he <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>what</b> he could with what was at his disposal.|$|E
5|$|Ernest was {{the subject}} of more {{allegations}} in 1832, when two young women accused him of trying to ride them down as they walked near Hammersmith. The Duke had not left his grounds at Kew on the day in question, and was able to ascertain that the rider was one of his equerries, who professed not to have seen the women. Nevertheless, newspapers continued to print references to the incident, suggesting that Ernest <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>what</b> the women stated, and was cravenly trying to push blame on another. The same year, the Duke sued for libel after a book appeared accusing him of having his valet Neale kill Sellis, and the jury found against the author. Also in 1832, the Cumberlands suffered tragedy, as young Prince George went blind. The Prince had been blind in one eye from infancy; an accident at age thirteen took the sight of the other. Ernest had hoped his son might marry Princess Victoria and keep the British and Hanoverian Thrones united, but the handicap made it unlikely George could win Princess Victoria's hand, and raised questions about whether he should succeed in Hanover.|$|E

In Mogothle v Premier, Northwest Province, the Labour Court relied on the employer's duty of fair dealing with employees to find the suspension of an employee unfair not in terms of section 186 of the LRA, but rather in terms of the common law.|$|E
25|$|In {{line with}} Park's suggestion, younger {{characters}} were introduced: Nick Tilsley was recast, played by Adam Rickitt, single mother Zoe Tattersall (Joanne Froggatt) first appeared, and the Battersbys moved into No.5. Storylines focussed on tackling 'issues', such as drug dealers, eco-warriors, religious cults, and a transsexual woman. Park quit in 1998, after deciding that he <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>what</b> {{he intended to}} do; he maintained that his biggest achievement was the introduction of Hayley Patterson (Julie Hesmondhalgh), the first transsexual character in a British soap.|$|E
25|$|The shutout win was the Patriots' {{first since}} 2006, while the Patriots' eight passing {{attempts}} were the second fewest in franchise history, behind only the three attempts in the Snowplow Game of 1982. This game also cemented an NFL {{record for the}} Patriots for the fewest penalties in a 16-game season, with 57, breaking the 2007 Seattle Seahawks' former record of 59 in a season. New England <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>what</b> they needed to do, but unfortunately watched as Miami and Baltimore won their late games and left the Dolphins as the 2008 AFC East champs, the Ravens as a wild card team, and the Patriots missing {{the playoffs for the}} first time since 2002.|$|E

25|$|During {{their years}} of residence, the Mosers {{collected}} extensive lexical and cultural information, {{much of which}} would be published later in various books and articles. Recorded legends and history were published in the Seri language, and some appear in later collections in English and Spanish. A Seri-Spanish vocabulary book was published in 1961, an ethnobotany (with botanist Richard S. Felger) in 1985 (which has been hailed as a modern classic), and a major dictionary in 2005, thirty years after Edward’s death, but based largely on work that he and Roberto Herrera Marcos (a.k.a. Roberto Herrera Thomson) <b>had</b> <b>done.</b> <b>What</b> is known today about Seri history and culture, including the so-called “band” structure of this group, is the result of work that the Mosers and Herrera did. Even work that does not bear either of their names as authors, such as the article in the journal Science about hibernating sea turtles, the book about the San Esteban people, and the 2005 dictionary, as well as most work on the Seri language and culture during the past half century) is part of their legacy.|$|E
25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>what</b> we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E
500|$|Laucke took up snooker, {{and became}} {{competent}} enough by age thirteen {{to gain a}} job as a demonstrator for the Brunswick Corporation, a snooker table manufacturer. Laucke learned billiards from George Chenier, a fellow Montrealer and the North American snooker champion. The two faced each again four years later at the North American snooker championships in Montreal, where Laucke won the championship. Laucke recalled: [...] "Then I decided to leave snooker, I <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>what</b> I wanted to do... My love for the guitar was overwhelming. There was a lot more money in snooker, but snooker was just a passion, and music was my love." [...] Laucke used his snooker winnings to finance 110trips from Montreal to New York City to study the classical guitar with Franco-Spaniard Rolando Valdés-Blain.|$|E

500|$|German {{scientists}} [...] {{that had}} been captured by the Alsos Mission were held in several camps, separate from other prisoners of war. After VE Day, SHAEF decided to concentrate them in an internment camp at Kransberg Castle, codenamed [...] "Dustbin", as part of Operation Epsilon. At Welsh's instigation, ten of the nuclear physicists, Bagge, Diebner, Gerlach, Hahn, Harteck, Heisenberg, Korsching, von Laue, von Weizsäcker and Wirtz, were brought to England. They were accommodated [...] between 3 July 1945 and 3 January 1946 at Farm Hall, a house in Godmanchester, near Cambridge, {{that had been}} used by MI6 and SOE agents preparing to be flown into occupied Europe from nearby RAF Tempsford. [...] The premises were thoroughly bugged to determine how close the German nuclear project had been to constructing an atomic bomb by listening in to their conversations., and transcripts of their conversations were sent to Groves. [...] The most interesting conversations occurred after they received the news of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, when they struggled to comprehend how the Allies <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>what</b> they could not.|$|E
500|$|Although Sgt.

Bill Bruford, a veteran of several progressive rock bands, said that Sgt. Pepper's transformed both musicians' ideas of what was possible and audiences' ideas of what was acceptable in music. He believed that: [...] "Without the Beatles, or someone else who <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>what</b> the Beatles did, it is fair to assume that there would have been no progressive rock." [...] In the aftermath of Sgt. Pepper, magazines such as Melody Maker drew a sharp line between [...] "pop" [...] and [...] "rock', thus eliminating the [...] "roll" [...] from [...] "rock and roll" [...] (which now refers to the 1950s style). The only artists who remained [...] "rock" [...] would be those who were considered at the vanguard of compositional forms, far from [...] "radio friendly" [...] standards, as Americans increasingly used the adjective [...] "progressive" [...] for groups like Jethro Tull, Family, East of Eden, Van Der Graaf Generator, and King Crimson.|$|E
