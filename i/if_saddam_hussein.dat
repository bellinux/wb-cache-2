5000|$|Political {{preparation}} for war {{began in earnest}} {{during the period of}} weapons inspections in Iraq over the winter of 2002-2003, carried out by a team led by Hans Blix with the authority of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441. The U.S. and its principal allies, the United Kingdom, Spain and Portugal, maintained a skeptical position on the results of the inspections procedure. Under pressure from his Secretary of State, Colin Powell, and his main ally, the UK, President Bush decided to try to obtain UN backing for an invasion. The so-called [...] "second resolution" [...] (the first being 1441) was eventually drafted and presented to the UN Security Council. It was a tough resolution, calling for immediate compliance with the previous resolutions requiring disarmament, and setting a 10-day deadline for compliance. Critics saw it as an unrealistic ultimatum designed to provide the U.S. with a cause for war, and it met considerable opposition in the security council, with opponents including the permanent members France, China, and Germany. After a period of intense diplomacy, President Bush met with his British, Spanish and Portuguese counterparts, Prime Minister Tony Blair, Prime Minister José María Aznar and Prime Minister José Manuel Barroso in the Azores, Portugal on March 15 and 16. Declaring that [...] "diplomacy had failed," [...] he announced the intention to drop the proposed resolution. Subsequently, both the U.S. and the UK accused France of effectively blocking the negotiations by threatening to veto the proposed resolution [...] "whatever the circumstances", but France maintained that its position had been intentionally misconstrued. Lacking the [...] "second resolution", the U.S. announced its intention to attack Iraq regardless <b>if</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> did not abdicate.|$|E
5000|$|Contradicting those claims, in November 2002 Ritter was on CNN's crossfire and {{cautioned against}} the {{invasion}} citing serious concern that Saddam would use chemical weapons {{in defense of}} Baghdad:As I testified to the U.S. Senate in 1998, Iraq has the indigenous capability right now to reconstitute a chemical weapons program {{within a matter of}} weeks.

In fact, we didn't find his name at all. Because in 1990, he didn't work for the Iraqi Nuclear Program. He had no knowledge of it because he worked as a kickback specialist for Hussein Kamel in the Presidential Palace.|$|E

40|$|We analyze {{financial}} market data {{in order to}} produce an ex-ante assessment of the economic consequences of war with Iraq. The novel feature of our analysis derives from the existence of a market for Saddam Securities,' a new future traded on an online betting exchange that pays only <b>if</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> is ousted. A variety of tests suggest that this future's price provides a plausible estimate of the probability of war. The spot oil price has moved closely with the Saddam Security, suggesting that war raises oil prices by around $ 10 per barrel. Futures prices imply that markets expect these large immediate disruptions to dissipate quickly, with prices returning to pre-war levels within {{about a year and a}} half. Evidence on the long-run effects is fragile, and while prices are probably expected to fall a little as a result of war, any oil dividend' will be minimal. We find large effects in equity markets: and war lowers the value of U. S. equities by around 15 percent. This effect is concentrated in the consumer discretionary sector, airlines and IT; the prospect of war bolsters the gold and energy sectors. Analyzing option prices, we find that the large estimated average effects of war reflect the market pricing in a range of different scenarios - a 70 percent probability that it will lead to market declines of 0 to 15 percent, a 20 percent chance of 15 to 30 percent declines, and a 10 percent risk of a fall in excess of 30 percent. Across countries, the most extreme effects are on the stock markets of Turkey, Israel, and several European nations. Countries that are highly enmeshed in the world economy, or net oil importers, are most likely to experience adverse effects from war. ...|$|E
40|$|Speaking at a Perth International Writers Festival {{panel on}} ’The State We’re In’, Peter Mares {{argued that the}} cost of war will be high. I KNOW that the state we are {{supposed}} to be in is ‘alert’ but not ‘alarmed’. But it is impossible not to be alarmed when you consider the current trajectory of this federal government, this country and indeed the world. It now seems certain that the state we will soon be in will be a state of war. The US has made it quite clear that it will attack Iraq, with our without United Nations backing; and Australia will clearly be one of the so-called ‘coalition of the willing’ that joins them. Prime Minister John Howard has argued repeatedly that the UN Security Council must act or lose all credibility, because it will have allowed Saddam Hussein to defy its will. Two points are worth making here. 1. On numerous occasions in the past, nations have defied the United Nations and the Security Council. Israel is the most obvious example, having refused to withdraw from the Occupied Territories. But there are others, too, who have thumbed their nose at the UN with impunity. For nearly a quarter of a century, Indonesia ignored Security Council resolutions number 384 and 389, calling on the government of Indonesia to ‘withdraw without delay all its forces’ from the territory of East Timor. So if the line of Mr Howard’s argument is to hold true, then the Security Council has very little credibility left to lose in any case. 2. The second point worth making is essentially the obverse of the Prime Minister’s argument. He says the UN will lose all credibility if it does not vote to attack Iraq, but we must ask the question in return: what credibility will the UN and the international system have if the US attacks Iraq without a UN resolution? Surely that too will mean that international law is meaningless. If the world’s one superpower can launch an attack - call it anticipatory self defense, call it a pre-emptive strike, or what you will - without UN sanction, then what use is there in having an international system of checks and balances and rules and treaties? I think it is worth quoting General Peter Gration (retired) at this point. Gration, you will remember, is no radical. He was the head of Australia’s defence force from 1987 to 1993, {{at the time of the}} first Gulf War. He is alarmed by the fact that the US has ‘changed from the containment and deterrence used successfully through 40 years of the Cold War to an open-ended doctrine of the right to pre-emptive strike if the US perceives a threat developing to its global supremacy’. This ‘strike[s] at the very heart of efforts to create a rules-based international order It signals that unprovoked offensive military action is permissible if it is directed against something that looks like it might developed into a threat. If this becomes acceptable international behaviour then the world will become a much less stable place. ’ The question here is not so much whether Iraq has some weapons of mass destruction and is attempting to hide such things from UN inspectors. I think we can assume that it does and it is - that much of the Bush/ Blair/ Howard case for war is based in fact. The question is what to do about this; about whether this really requires urgent military action and regime change, or whether the Iraqi threat, like the North Korean threat, can be contained through a range of measures such as no-fly zones, inspections and sanctions, and, ultimately, the threat of massive retaliation should Iraq launch aggressive military action. Again let me quote Peter Gration: ‘Saddam Hussein has been contained and deterred from using his WMD (like the Soviet Union, China and North Korea before him), and there is no reason why containment and deterrence should not continue to be effective [...] . It is simply incredible to suggest that a decrepit desert state such as Iraq, still battered from the Gulf War, poses a threat to the only global superpower, let alone to the world. ’ And if containment is an option, as Gration and others suggest, then how do the costs and benefits of that strategy stack up against the risks of opting for war? The 500, 000 potential casualties that the UN has discussed in a confidential report suggest that war is difficult to justify on any grounds. (Middle East specialist Professor Amin Saikal suggests that Saddam Hussein is unlikely to really pay much attention to the plight of the Iraqi people in the event of war. ‘I think his basic objective would be to make an American victory as difficult as possible,’ he told ABC Radio National, ‘and he will unleash whatever he has at his disposal, and if that means that a lot of Iraqi civilians are targeted by the Americans in order to penetrate Saddam Hussein’s security and armed forces, then Saddam Hussein will let that be the case. ’ And war could be a high risk strategy for other reasons. <b>If</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> is going to use his WMD, it will most likely be at that point when his back is to the wall. In other words just such a scenario as the coming war will bring. Peter Gration says the point when Iraq’s weapons might be used ‘could be as a desperate last gesture by Iraq in self defence against a US or Israeli attack, when the Iraqi leadership realised they were facing extinction’. An even more alarming scenario, suggested by Saikal, is that Saddam Hussein will deliberately seek to provoke a US nuclear attack on Iraq, ‘because an American nuclear response will not only put the whole of Iraq in flames, but also will outrage the entire Arab and Muslim world, and that’s what Saddam Hussein’s strategy would be, to really basically stir up the Arab world as well as the Muslim world, in support of what he may consider to be self-adulation in history for himself’. Some people might argue here that I have missed the point - that the real threat posed by Saddam Hussein and his WMD is that Iraq will supply those weapons to a terrorist outfit like Al Qaeda. Most analysts agree this is the weakest link in the chain of US argument; Saddam’s regime and Al Qaeda are at opposite ends of the ideological spectrum. If terrorists were to get hold of weapons of mass destruction I suggest that they might come from a different quarter. Take the case of Pakistan. It is a country where democracy has been suspended and power is concentrated in the hands of one man. It is a country where religious and ethnic minorities suffer discrimination and abuse. It has a powerful military intelligence organisation that has been responsible for funding and organising extremist groups, and encouraging them to carry out terrorist attacks outside its territory. This country has fought a bitter war with an immediate neighbour. It is a country where the economy is on the brink of collapse, which could serve as an encouragement to military adventurism. Perhaps most disturbing of all, Pakistan is known to have the capacity to produce and deliver weapons of mass destruction, and the risk of war with India is real, given that Kashmir remains one of the world’s most dangerous flash points. Of course, Pakistan is one of the United States’ key allies in the war on terror, and of course it is different from Iraq in many ways. Pakistan has an independent and lively media and opposition political parties are still able to function. President Musharraf has not displayed the same ruthlessness as Saddam Hussein in dispatching his opponents or launching war on minority groups within his own country. But there is every indication that Musharraf is endeavouring to entrench himself in power, and if he succeeds then who knows what kind of leader he will become in the future. After all, Saddam Hussein was himself once a trusted friend of Washington, his secular, modernist regime seen as a bulwark against the theocratic revolutionaries in Iran. So if there is a threat of terrorists getting hold of nuclear weapons, then perhaps Pakistan is a more likely route than Iraq. All it would take would be a disaffected nuclear scientist or senior military office with Islamist leanings. My point in drawing these comparisons is not to diminish in any way the threat that Saddam Hussein represents to his own people or to the rest of the world but to suggest how our perceptions of threat are constantly shifting (and, if you like, constantly manipulated). It was not so long before 11 September 2001 that the focus of official western concern was China. Remember the spy plane incident? China as an emerging power in the Asia Pacific region, China’s arms build-up, China’s export of weapons technology [...] . Canberra was being reminded by senior officials in Washington that if the US ended up at war with China over Taiwan, then Australia would be expected to play its part. Now China, too, is an ally in the war on terror. Before September 11, there was concern about Russia’s actions in Chechnya. It has now evaporated. Post September 11, the United States has developed close alliances with governments in Central Asia - the ‘stans’, Khazakstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikstan, Kyrgistan - governments run by oppressive remnants from the Soviet era whose suppression of dissent, particularly dissent expressed through Islam, is probably helping to breed the next generation of religious extremists. Again - I do not wish to diminish or underplay the nature of the regime in Iraq. It seems to me that ‘regime change’ in Iraq would be no bad thing; the question is what comes next. It seems to me that before embarking on military action, it would be helpful to consider the figure of the refugee. As Arthur Helton writes in his recent book The Price of Indifference, refugees ‘provide important insights into the modern dilemmas of statecraft’, not least because their very presence reflects past ‘failures in governance and international relations’. Human displacement sows seeds of instability that can blossom into ugly flowers. (Look at Israel and the Palestinian territories.) Before following George W. Bush to Baghdad, we should contemplate the figure of the refugee and think carefully about what the possible consequences of our actions. BUT could the war in Iraq be a quick, clean war, like the war in Afghanistan to oust the Taliban supposedly was? There are many answers to this question. Firstly of course, no war is really quick and clean, though it may be sanitised. Secondly, while the battle against the Taliban was won quickly, the war in Afghanistan has only just begun. The ‘peace’ in Afghanistan does not reach far beyond Kabul, where the international assistance force patrols the streets. The Karzai government is years or decades away from becoming a stable regime, let alone a democratic one, if it ever does. The huge task of rebuilding Afghanistan’s shattered infrastructure has barely started. In other words, Afghanistan remains a failed state, fuelled by one viable crop, opium, replete with uncontrolled guns and liable to produce and harbour more extremists like Mullah Omar and Osama bin Laden (both of whom, it should be remembered, apparently remain at large). Let us ask ourselves: how much attention will Afghanistan get once the world is called upon to rebuild a freshly liberated Iraq? In military terms, Iraq is also a different proposition to Afghanistan. The Iraqi military, demoralised as it may be, is not a student militia. Iraq is not controlled by regional warlords who will take down one flag of allegiance and run up another as soon as the prevailing wind changes direction. Thirdly, the long term repercussions of an attack on Iraq are unpredictable and may be grave. In the Middle East and parts of Asia, the war will be perceived (and in some cases deliberately represented) as a white, Christian war against the Muslim world. It will be seen as another injustice, another insult to Islam, and could lead to greater long term instability. As Malaysia’s Prime Minister Dr Mahathir has warned, it will be seen as ‘a clash of civilizations, that of the West against the Islamic civilisation’, Samuel Huntington’s thesis made real. ‘The West does not care to find out the causes of terrorism and remove them,’ says Mahathir, and indeed, in our current debate, it seems that examining the causes of terrorism is often equated with justifying terrorism. To point out that the unresolved dispute between Palestine and Israel remains a source of great anger in the Muslim world is not the same as saying that the US had it coming to them. Of course there is no simple trajectory from injustice to terrorism. It has been pointed out often enough that Osama bin Laden comes from a family of billionaires. But this does not invalidate the view that, unless injustice is overcome - or at least, unless a sincere effort is made to acknowledge and tackle injustice - then the war on terror will be never-ending. This question of perception is particularly important for Australia, given our geographical location. While John Howard is planning to stop in Jakarta on his way back from Washington it is clear that the federal government has no real inclination to listen to what the Indonesians have to say. There is no real consultation with our neighbours, and I think very little recognition of how this war could play out in terms of Australia’s image in the region. Nor is there much discussion of the destabilising effect that the war could have on Indonesia’s fragile domestic political balance in the lead-up to national elections in 2004. This war could be just what the Indonesian Islamists need to strengthen their position and rebuild in Indonesia after the damage done to their credibility by the atrocity of the Bali bombing. I think, however, it will be a long time before Australian government ministers realise that they could actually listen to, and learn from, their Indonesian counterparts, instead of just telling them things. Fourthly, the war in Iraq could produce the exact opposite of its supposed aims. Rather than preventing terrorism and making the world a more stable place, it could provoke instability and provide the motivation for a new wave of attacks. To quote Peter Gration again, ‘this action against Iraq could spawn a whole new generation of suicidal terrorists targeting the US and its allies, and hence actually worsen our security situation’. There are many and varied voices opposing the war in Australia, but I expect the real dilemma for the anti-war movement, and in particular for the federal Labor Party, is about to come. It will come when the Security Council does give the green light to George Bush’s war plans, as I suspect it ultimately will. France has not used its veto power in the Security Council since 1956. As Peter Hartcher has argued, it is unlikely to do so now, given that the war is going to happen anyway, and if France does not support it, then it risks losing ‘any say over the conduct of the Iraq war, and the disposition of its oil and other spoils afterwards’. If the UN backs a war, then Simon Crean must back it also; this is the logic of his position in advocating that UN processes must be followed. This will split the Labor party and seriously weaken the anti war movement, and Howard may once again come out on top. As with Howard’s Tampa victory in the November 2001 election, there will be a high price to pay for this short term gain; the long term result will be a more defensive, frightened, intolerant and divided Australia.
