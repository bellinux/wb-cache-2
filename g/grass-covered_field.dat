500|$|The Green (formally the College Green) is a <b>grass-covered</b> <b>field</b> {{and common}} {{space at the}} center of Dartmouth College, an Ivy League {{university}} located in Hanover, New Hampshire, United States. It was among the first parcels of land obtained by the College upon its founding in 1769, and is the only creation of the 18th century remaining {{at the center of}} the campus. After being cleared of pine trees, it initially served as a pasture and later as an athletic field for College sporting events. Today, it is a central location for rallies, celebrations, and demonstrations, and serves as a general, all-purpose recreation area. The College describes the Green as [...] "historic" [...] and as the [...] "emotional center" [...] of the institution.|$|E
50|$|The park is 960000 m2 in area. It {{includes}} a large <b>grass-covered</b> <b>field,</b> {{as well as}} 8 km of trails, one of {{which leads to the}} Raymond-Lévesque Library.|$|E
50|$|The most {{prominent}} 2.5-acre {{section of the}} Temple Lot is currently an open, <b>grass-covered</b> <b>field</b> occupied in its northeast corner by a few trees and {{the headquarters of the}} Church of Christ (Temple Lot), which is not considered a temple by adherents of that sect. No other structures (with the exception of monuments, markers and signposts) exist on the 2.5-acre section, although numerous important structures exist on the 63.5-acre section, such as the United Nations Peace Plaza, the Community of Christ Auditorium, the Truman Railroad Depot, the LDS Visitors Center, the Community of Christ Temple, an LDS Church stake center, and the Six Nations Tree of Peace.|$|E
60|$|On Sunday {{afternoon}} {{we took a}} little walk. Our minds were still troubled about the spot toward which we ought to journey next day, and we needed the soothing influences of Nature. The country {{to the north and}} west of our little farm was very beautiful. About half a mile from the house a modest river ran; on each side of it were <b>grass-covered</b> <b>fields</b> and hills, and in some places there were extensive tracks of woodlands.|$|R
40|$|A {{model for}} {{simulating}} the measured backscattering coefficient of vegetation-covered soil surfaces includes both coherent and incoherent {{components of the}} backscattered radar pulses from a rough sil surface. The effect of vegetation canopy scattering is also incorporated into the model by making the radar pulse subject to two-way attenuation and volume scattering when it passes through the vegetation layer. Model results agree well with the measured angular distributions of the radar backscattering coefficient for HH polarization at the 1. 6 GHz and 4. 75 GHz frequencies over <b>grass-covered</b> <b>fields.</b> It {{was found that the}} coherent scattering component is very important at angles near nadir, while the vegetation volume scattering is dominant at incident angles 30 degrees...|$|R
50|$|The {{school has}} a full gym/auditorium (with three classrooms), a second newly {{constructed}} gym, a cafeteria and a regulation sized <b>grass-covered</b> soccer/softball <b>field</b> with a 300-meter track being renovated this year. An on-campus parking garage for 74 vehicles was constructed last school year. ACST shares use of a newly constructed 25-meter swimming pool located at the nearby United States Embassy to Tunisia.|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} for estimating hourly actual evapotranspiration from short natural vegetation or agricultural crops. The method, {{which can be}} used to calibrate remotely sensed evapotranspiration, consists of equating the ET flux equations based on the generalized Penman-Monteith (GPM) combination method and a humidity gradient (HG) method. By equating the GPM and HG expressions, a single unknown parameter, either the bulk surface resistance (rs) or aerodynamic resistance (ra), can be determined. This paper provides an overview of the technical approach used, and presents results of comparisons between the new method and eddy covariance systems in Florida and Puerto Rico. The new method performed well compared to the eddy covariance systems, and has the advantage of being relatively inexpensive. An example is presented in which the average surface temperature of a <b>grass-covered</b> <b>field,</b> located at the University of Puerto Rico Agricultural Experiment Station at Rio Piedras, PR (located within the San Juan metropolitan area), obtained by NASA’s airborne Advanced Thermal and Land Applications Sensor (ATLAS), was corrected to provide accurate estimates of ET using a flux gradient equation...|$|E
40|$|Rainfall {{infiltration}} characteristics for a semi-arid watershed soil were studied. The soil examined {{was obtained}} from Page Ranch, 25 miles north of Tucson, Arizona. Laboratory infiltration tests were conducted on reconstructed soil profiles similar to those on the watershed. A mathematical model of infiltration, developed by Dr. Roger Smith, was used to simulate the infiltration process. Results from infiltration tests conducted on site at the watershed during a previous research study were also simulated using the infiltration model. Laboratory and field infiltration tests were conducted using a realistic rotating disk rainfall simulator. Single- and dual-source gamma ray attenuation techniques were used to obtain soil moisture measurements within the laboratory soil profiles. Direct measurement of surface crusting effects in the laboratory using the dual-source technique was attempted but {{was determined to be}} unworkable due to resolution and boundary effect problems. Using the measured saturated hydraulic conductivity values of the laboratory and field soils, and the unsaturated soil properties as measured for the field soil, the mathematical model of infiltration as developed by Dr. Roger Smith simulated the infiltration rates of bare test plots. By changing the saturated conductivity of the upper soil layer, it was also possible to simulate the infiltration process on a <b>grass-covered</b> <b>field</b> plot...|$|E
40|$|A {{feasibility}} study of machine vision applications was conducted for agricultural vehicle navigation in open field environments, {{and focused on}} solving certain fundamental issues in vision-based agricultural vehicle navigation. Those issues were: (1) camera installation pose automatic calibration; (2) vehicle heading estimation and (3) field edge detection. A stereo color camera was selected to support the research on the three issues. Stereo cameras {{have been used as}} perception sensors for agricultural vehicle navigation for years. One problem impeding their broader application is the difficulty of determining the camera???s installation pose using conventional measuring tools, especially when they are used in an open-field agricultural environment. To solve this problem, an automated calibration method was developed to determine the camera???s installation pose with respect to the vehicle frame. Based on this method, a binocular stereo camera acquired a sequence of images as the vehicle moved straight forward a short distance on relatively even ground. A machine vision algorithm was used to detect static feature points on the ground and track their three-dimensional (3 D) motions in relationship to the vehicle. A plane fitting for the ground features was then used to determine the camera roll and pitch, and the tracked motions were used to estimate the camera yaw. The results obtained from the field test validated that this method was capable of determining the camera installation pose automatically in order to achieve a calibration accuracy of ?? 1 ?? over approximately 10 m of test distance. The calibrated poses could be used to compensate for the navigation errors induced by the misalignment of the camera. An image processing algorithm was developed to investigate the feasibility of using stereovision to estimate the heading direction of a moving vehicle in open agricultural field environments. The algorithm first detected, and then tracked, static natural ground features in every two consecutive images that were taken by a stereo camera mounted on a vehicle while the vehicle was in motion. These static features were used as references to calculate the vehicle???s three-dimensional (3 D) motion. In the final stage, the vehicle heading direction was estimated using the 3 D motion. Working with a series of sequential image frames taken while the vehicle was in motion, the algorithm continuously estimated the vehicle heading direction. Field tests were conducted to evaluate its usability. When the vehicle traveled straight forward, the proposed algorithm worked properly. When the vehicle traveled in an oscillating mode, the algorithm responded properly when the vehicle turned, but with less estimation accuracy than in the straight traveling mode. The field tests showed {{that it is possible to}} use stereovision to estimate a moving vehicle???s heading direction in an open agricultural field. Field edges are important references for human drivers who steer vehicles in agricultural operations. This research explored the possibility of using machine vision to detect field edges in open field agricultural environments. A detecting algorithm was proposed based on the hue difference between an open <b>field</b> and its <b>grass-covered</b> edge. <b>Field</b> tests showed that the algorithm was capable of distinguishing a relatively clear edge from an open field. However, when the field edge was not clear, the algorithm was unable to identify it due to the existence of noise. This research showed that images with lower resolution were less affected by noise. The same algorithm detected unclear field edges after reducing noise by lowering image resolution. Color change adaptability was also implemented in order to improve the algorithm???s robustness. As a result, it was possible to use machine vision to detect the grass covered edges of an open agricultural field. This research proved the feasibility of the machine vision applications in the three targeted problems, and has shown that machine vision is capable of navigating agricultural vehicles in open field environments...|$|R
