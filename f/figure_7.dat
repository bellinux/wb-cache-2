5|$|When the {{right-hand}} side of the equation is a positive real number, the solution corresponds to an epispiral. When the argument θ1 – θ0 equals ±90°×k, the cosine goes to zero and the radius goes to infinity. Thus, when k is less than one, the range of allowed angles becomes small and the force is repulsive (red curve on right in Figure7). On the other hand, when k is greater than one, the range of allowed angles increases, corresponding to an attractive force (green, cyan and blue curves on left in Figure7); the orbit of the particle can even wrap around the center several times. The possible values of the parameter k may range from zero to infinity, which corresponds to values of μ ranging from negative infinity up to the positive upper limit, L12/m. Thus, for all attractive inverse-cube forces (negative μ) there is a corresponding epispiral orbit, as for some repulsive ones (μ < L12/m), as illustrated in <b>Figure</b> <b>7.</b> Stronger repulsive forces correspond to a faster linear motion.|$|E

25|$|The {{woodpecker}} toy is a {{well known}} benchmark problem in contact dynamics. The toy consists of a pole, a sleeve with a hole that is slightly larger than {{the diameter of the}} pole, a spring and the woodpecker body.

25|$|In the {{original}} Franck–Condon principle, after the electronic transition, the molecules which {{end up in}} higher vibrational states immediately begin to relax to the lowest vibrational state. In the case of solvation, the solvent molecules will immediately try to rearrange themselves {{in order to minimize}} the interaction energy. The rate of solvent relaxation depends on the viscosity of the solvent. Assuming the solvent relaxation time is short compared with the lifetime of the electronic excited state, emission will be from the lowest solvent energy state of the excited electronic state. For small-molecule solvents such as water or methanol at ambient temperature, solvent relaxation time is on the order of some tens of picoseconds whereas chromophore excited state lifetimes range from a few picoseconds to a few nanoseconds. Immediately after the transition to the ground electronic state, the solvent molecules must also rearrange themselves to accommodate the new electronic configuration of the chromophore. <b>Figure</b> <b>7</b> illustrates the Franck–Condon principle applied to solvation. When the solution is illuminated by with light corresponding to the electronic transition energy, some of the chromophores will move to the excited state. Within this group of chromophores there will be a statistical distribution of solvent-chromophore interaction energies, represented in the figure by a Gaussian distribution function. The solvent-chromophore interaction is drawn as a parabolic potential in both electronic states. Since the electronic transition is essentially instantaneous on the time scale of solvent motion (vertical arrow), the collection of excited state chromophores is immediately far from equilibrium. The rearrangement of the solvent molecules according to the new potential energy curve is represented by the curved arrows in <b>Figure</b> <b>7.</b> Note that while the electronic transitions are quantized, the chromophore-solvent interaction energy is treated as a classical continuum due to the large number of molecules involved. Although emission is depicted as taking place from the minimum of the excited state chromophore-solvent interaction potential, significant emission can take place before equilibrium is reached when the viscosity of the solvent is high or the lifetime of the excited state is short. The energy difference between absorbed and emitted photons depicted in <b>Figure</b> <b>7</b> is the solvation contribution to the Stokes shift.|$|E

By contrast, an {{increased number of}} CD24+ cells {{have been identified in}} distant metastases in breast cancer patients. It is possible that CD44+CD24−/low cells initially metastasize and in the new site change their phenotype and undergo limited differentiation. The two-phase expression pattern hypothesis proposes two forms of cancer stem cells - stationary (SCS) and mobile (MCS). SCS are embedded in tissue and persist in differentiated areas throughout tumor progression. MCS are located at the tumor-host interface. These cells are apparently derived from SCS through the acquisition of transient EMT (<b>Figure</b> <b>7).</b>|$|E

25|$|Lancelets, {{which are}} {{primitive}} chordates, possess only one homologue of Drosophila Hh (<b>figure</b> <b>7).</b> Vertebrates, {{on the other}} hand, have several hedgehog ligands that fall within three subgroups – desert, Indian and sonic, each represented by a single mammalian gene. This is probably {{a consequence of the}} two genome duplications that occurred early in the vertebrate evolutionary history. Two such events would have produced four homologous genes, one of which must have been lost. Desert hedgehogs are the most closely related to Drosophila Hh. Additional gene duplications occurred within some species such as the zebrafish Danio rerio, which has an additional tiggywinkle hedgehog gene in the sonic group. Various vertebrate lineages have adapted hedgehogs to unique developmental processes. For example, a homologue of the X.laevis banded hedgehog is involved in regeneration of the salamander limb.|$|E
25|$|Citalopram has {{the second}} most {{selectivity}} for SERT, no effects on NE or DA re-uptake and nor does it have affinity to other neuroreceptors. Citalopram is composed of two enantiomers, (R)- and (S)-, which are mirror images of each other (<b>figure</b> <b>7).</b> Researches has shown that nearly all the activity resides in the (S)-enantiomer and that (R)-citalopram actually counteracts {{the action of the}} (S)-enantiomer. The combination of the two enantiomers is known as racemic citalopram and has weak antihistaminic properties that reside in the (R)-enantiomer. Solution to improve the properties of racemic citalopram is to remove the unwanted (R)-enantiomer. The resulting drug is better known as escitalopram, but it is composed of only the pure active (S)-(+)-isomer. This change appears to remove the antihistaminic properties of the drug. By removing the (R)-enantiomer, the lowest dose of escitalopram becomes more efficacious and faster onset than comparable dose of citalopram, where escitalopram has twice the activity of citalopram and is at least 27 times more potent than the (R)-enantiomer. Escitalopram is therefore the only SSRI drug for which pure SERT inhibition is responsible for almost all of its pharmacological action. Escitalopram is the newest and most selective inhibitor of the SSRIs and is today considered the best tolerated SSRI.|$|E
25|$|Is {{the main}} {{amplifier}} block also a two-port? The main amplifier {{is shown in}} the upper shaded box. The ground connections are labeled. <b>Figure</b> <b>7</b> shows the interesting fact that the main amplifier does not satisfy the port conditions at its input and output unless the ground connections are chosen to make that happen. For example, on the input side, the current entering the main amplifier is IS. This current is divided three ways: to the feedback network, to the bias resistor RB and to the base resistance of the input transistor rπ. To satisfy the port condition for the main amplifier, all three components must be returned to the input side of the main amplifier, which means all the ground leads labeled G1 must be connected, as well as emitter lead GE1. Likewise, on the output side, all ground connections G2 must be connected and also ground connection GE2. Then, {{at the bottom of the}} schematic, underneath the feedback two-port and outside the amplifier blocks, G1 is connected to G2. That forces the ground currents to divide between the input and output sides as planned. Notice that this connection arrangement splits the emitter of the input transistor into a base-side and a collector-side – a physically impossible thing to do, but electrically the circuit sees all the ground connections as one node, so this fiction is permitted.|$|E

25|$|The {{architecture}} is best understood and {{is almost always}} broken up into four groups and then looking at how architecture changed or didn’t change within those groups. The four groups are: May, Satunsat, and Ah Canul/Canul and Dzib. These groups make up the urban center, and are almost exclusively monumental architecture. They were defined by the excavation team and they’re essentially just a cluster of buildings, or a building (Madrid, 1991). There’s {{a lot more than}} just these four groups; the rest just hasn’t been excavated really, since there was such a heavy focus on excavating monumental architecture. Most of what’s been excavated at Oxkintok is temples, palaces, and multiroom structures. To trace the changes in architecture of the site, the above chart (Fig. 7) was compiled. It’s a compilation of data from the three sources listed below <b>figure</b> <b>7.</b> It is evident that there are lots of major changes between the three periods, and in general it's a transition from irregular design to a more elaborate, very planned out geometric design with decoration and complex stucco art and stone wrought decorations. One thing that remains consistent the use of domes and arches for entryways and open spaces. Concerning the individual groups, there's a concentration of Proto Puuc in the Ah-Canul group and Early Oxkintok in the May group that was later modified in the Proto Puuc phase, but no group is confined to one phase.|$|E
