40|$|In Brief: Considering {{that just}} one of the two ALA-accredited MLIS {{programs}} in Illinois requires completion of even a single management course, good management practice is often left to on-the-job happenstance. How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> manage the personnel and political dynamics of your team when you can’t stop the clock and go to a management seminar? How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> what’s making your people dread coming into work and find solutions that engage and empower them and benefit your library? This article describes the process and findings from a project, funded by a grant from Consortium of Academic and Research Libraries in Illinois (CARLI) for the 2015 - 2016 academic year, to train a small cohort of academic librarians in a practical, hands-on management system called Recording/Interpreting/Solving Workflow Solutions...|$|R

40|$|The first Australian {{social news site}} {{might help}} us decide, writes MARGARET SIMONS IN A WORLD of {{infinite}} choice, how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> what is worth reading and who is worth listening to? This {{is one of the}} pressing questions in the new media age when, {{for the first time in}} human history, almost anyone can publish to the world. Big media companies would say that branding still matters - that people will trust the tried and tested. And, as we have seen, they are a bit precious about that. Every editor will tell you they want their publication discussed in the coffee queue, but when those discussions are critical, and published online, they can get very upset indeed, talking about “cannibalising” of content and the like [...] .

40|$|One day, <b>you</b> {{suddenly}} <b>find</b> that {{a private}} key corresponding to your Identity {{is up for}} sale at e-Bay. Since <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not suspect a key compromise, perhaps {{it must be the}} PKG who is acting dishonestly and trying to make money by selling your key. How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> for sure and even prove it in a court of law? This paper introduces the concept of Accountable Authority Identity based Encryption (A-IBE). A-IBE is a new approach to mitigate the (inherent) key escrow problem in identity based encryption schemes. Our main goal is to restrict {{the ways in which the}} PKG can misbehave. In our system, if the PKG ever maliciously generates and distributes a decryption key for an Identity, it runs the risk of being caught and prosecuted. In contrast to other mitigation approaches, our approach does not require multiple key generation authorities. ...|$|R

'Why, I looked at her forefinger, in course,' says Peggy, 'and saw the pricks of the needle on it, and soon made her talk a bit after that. She knows fancy-work and cuttin' out--would ye ever have thought it? And I'll show her how to give the workhouse the go-by to-morrow, if she only holds out, and keeps in her senses. Stop where you are, Peck! I'm going to make Jubber put his dirty hand {{into his pocket and}} pull out some money; and that's a sight worth stoppin' to see any day in the week.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{know you}} can!" [...] She sprang {{up with the}} {{greatest}} energy, {{and ran into the}} bedroom to put in order her tumbled hair; she kept talking to him from there. [...] "I want you to go down and see him the instant you have had dinner; and don't let him escape you. Tell him he can have the play on any terms.

Why, you haven't even the grace to carry out your own wicked deception--you haven't even gone to bed!" [...] There the voices grew less angry, and we missed what followed. Soon the lady burst out again, piteously entreating him this time. [...] "Oh, Marmy, don't ruin me! Has anybody offended you? Is there anything you wish to have altered? Do you want more money? It is too cruel to treat me in this way--it is indeed!" [...] He made some answer, which {{we were not able}} to hear; we could only suppose that he had upset her temper again. She went on louder than ever [...] "I've begged and prayed of you--and you're as hard as iron. I've told you about the Prince--and that has had no effect on you. I have done now. We'll see what the doctor says." [...] He got angry, in his turn; we heard him again. [...] "I won't see the doctor!" [...] "Oh, you refuse to see the doctor?--I shall make your refusal known--and if there's law in England, you shall feel it!" [...] Their voices dropped again; some new turn seemed to be taken by the conversation. We heard the lady once more, shrill and joyful this time. [...] "There's a dear! You see it, don't you, in the right light? And you haven't forgotten the old times, have you? You're the same dear, honorable, kind-hearted fellow that you always were!" ...|$|E

30|$|Academic Questions: The {{relevance}} of questions {{is important to}} inform {{the efficiency of the}} PBAF approach. The participants responded to pertinent academic questions, with an efficient completion time. As an example, the completion time of answers to profile questions “Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> about this course”, “student number” and “Last school attended” was the shortest in the academic theme with a mean completion time of 14.14, 14.55 and 14.60 seconds, which indicates that the {{relevance of}} questions is an important factor leading to increased efficiency.|$|E
