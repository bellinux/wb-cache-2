40|$|We {{have shown}} that a laser-produced plasma plume which is {{representative}} in composition of the condensed phase target can be reproducibly generated if {{the movement of the}} surface due to evaporation is kept in pace with the thermal diffusion front propagating into the bulk. The resulting mass loss is then strongly controlled by the thermal diffusivity of the target matter, and this relationship has been exploited to measure the thermal diffusivity of metallic alloys. We have developed a novel RF levitator-heater as a contamination-free molten metal source {{to be used as a}} target for LPP plume generation. In order to determine the mass loss due to LPP excitation, a new high sensitivity transducer has been constructed for measurement of the resulting impulse imparted on the specimen. The <b>impulse</b> <b>transducer</b> is built onto the specimen holder within the levitation-assisted molten metal source. The LPP method has been fully excercised for measurement of the thermal diffusivity of a molten specimen relative to the value for its room temperature solid. The results for SS 304 and SS 316 are presented together with a critique of the results. A numerical modeling of specimen heating in the molten metal source and the physical basis of the new hod are also presented...|$|E

40|$|Ultrasonic imaging {{has evolved}} from its early {{application}} which utilized only amplitude G-scans to more complex techniques which make extensive use of digital signal processing. Techniques, such as one- and two-dimensional deconvolution processing and synthetic aperture focussing techniques (SAFT), are becoming more widely accepted for conventional applications. In general, each of these techniques aims to improve the interpretability of the ultrasonic image by increasing the resolution {{in one or more}} dimensions. Resolution los ses in the time dimension of ultrasonic images result from the superimposition of the <b>transducer</b> <b>impulse</b> response onto the true acoustic impulse response of the layered material. [1] The occurrence of multiple reflections further complicates the interpretation of an ultrasonic image. Several one-dimensional deconvolution algorithms have already been developed and applied to the problem of removing the <b>transducer</b> <b>impulse</b> response from the ultrasonic data.

40|$|Traditional imaging {{techniques}} in medical ultrasound are mostly based on pre-defined geometrical processing of the measurement data. In this thesis however, {{we focus on}} finding the image that would best explain the observed measurement in a least squares sense, given an ultrasound model. This {{enables the use of}} prior knowledge such as <b>transducer</b> <b>impulse</b> responses and acoustic wave field theory to be fully taken into account, resulting in a spatio-temporal imaging technique. Since performance is dependent on modeling accuracy, this thesis investigates the formulation and verification of a linear ultrasound model that also takes the transducer lens into account. Additionally, a technique to easily estimate the <b>transducer</b> <b>impulse</b> response is proposed. After defining the linear model, several techniques that solve this linear system for the image are considered, namely Tikhonov regularized least squares, Tikhonov regularized non-negative least squares, basis pursuit de-noising. Using a synthetic aperture transmission scheme, these techniques are compared to delay-and-sum beamforming in both a simulation based resolution analysis, as well as in a real experiment using a high-resolution phantom in water. Results show that the proposed {{imaging techniques}} perform significantly better than conventional delay-and-sum beamforming.

40|$|In this work, an {{approach}} {{to the design of}} broadband thickness-mode piezoelectric transducer is pre-sented. In this approach, simulation of discrete time model of the impulse response of matched and backed piezoelectric transducer is used to design high sensitivity, broad bandwidth, and short-duration <b>impulse</b> response <b>transducers.</b> The effect of matching the performance of transmitting and receiving air backed PZT- 5 A transducer working into water load is studied. The optimum acoustical characteristics of the quarter wavelength matching layers are determined by a compromise between sensitivity and pulse duration. The thickness of bonding layers is smaller than that of the quarter wavelength matching layers so that they do not change the resonance peak significantly. Our calculations show that the − 3 dB air backed transducer bandwidth can be improved considerably by using quarter wavelength matching layers. The computer model developed in this work to predict the behavior of multilayer structures driven by a transient waveform agrees well with measured results. Furthermore, the advantage of this this model over other approaches is that the time signal for optimum set of matching layers can be predicted rapidly...|$|R
40|$|AbstractField II is an {{ultrasound}} simulation program capable of simulating the pressure scattering from inhomogeneous tissue. The simulations {{are based on}} a convolution between spatial impulse responses from the field in front of the transducer and the volt-to-surface acceleration impulse response of the transducer. For such simulations to reflect actual measured intensities and pressure levels, the <b>transducer</b> <b>impulse</b> response is to be known. This work presents results of combining a modified form of a 1 D linear transducer model originally suggested by Willatzen together with the Field II program to calibrate the pressure and intensity simulations of a 128 element convex medical transducer with elevation focus at 70 mm. The simulations are compared to pressure measurements from a transducer driven at 4. 0 MHz using a research scanner with a commercial transducer amplifier from BK Medical (Herlev, Denmark). As input waveform to the Field II model we measured the output voltage of the research amplifier. The peak voltage was limited to 31 V to avoid too high non-linear effects. We measured the hydrophone output from three transducer front elements by averaging 40 shoot sequences on each element using a remotely controlled Agilent MSO 6014 A oscilloscope. The pressure along the center line in a distance of 33 mm, 72 mm, and 112 mm from each element was measured as well as the intensity in the elevation plane in each depth. Results show that the 1 D modeling of the linear <b>transducer</b> <b>impulse</b> response predicts the pulse waveforms satisfying. We show a root mean square error of approximately 26 % on the pressure prediction and a root mean square error on the intensity prediction from 5. 8 – 16. 2 % from 72 mm to 112 mm, and an average of 15. 4 % at 33 mm, when a 1. 7 dB amplitude correction is made...|$|R
40|$|Programs {{capable of}} {{simulating}} ultrasound images {{have recently been}} developed. This opens the possibility of evaluating transducers and focusing schemes not only from their point spread function, but also from an imaging point of view. The calculation of the ultrasound field is based on linear acoustics using the TupholmeStepanishen method for calculating the spatial <b>impulse</b> response. Any <b>transducer</b> can be simulated by splitting the aperture into rectangular or triangular sub-apertures, and the calculation can include any transducer excitation and apodization. The acoustic settings can be controlled in the entire image through dynamic apodization and focusing. The transmit and receive apertures can be defined independently of each other. Frequency dependent attenuation can also {{be included in the}} simulation. The B-mode images are generated by specifying a number of independent scatterers in a file that defines their position and amplitude. Adjusting the number of scatterers and their [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} {{measurement}} techniques {{used to obtain}} aerodynamic forces and moments and surface/flow field pressures for models tested in impulse hypersonic-hypervelocity facilities and in conventional-type hypersonic wind tunnels is presented. Although force and moment measurement techniques presently used in hypersonic wind tunnels are relatively unchanged from the 1960 's and 1970 's, significant advances have recently been made for impulse facilities. For both hypersonic wind tunnels and impulse facilities, the state-of-the-art has advanced via refinements, improved test techniques, and advances in semiconductor technology, data acquisition systems, and computers. The introduction of electronically scanned pressure systems {{over a decade ago}} 'revolutionized' pressure measurements in hypersonic wind tunnels and a second 'revolution' is impending with the development and application of optical, two-dimensional, global pressure measurement techniques. The development and continued refinement of miniature piezoresistive transducers has provided the capability to perform detailed surface pressure measurements on relatively small, complex models in <b>impulse</b> facilities; these <b>transducers</b> also provided the capability for intrusive flow field pressure measurements with miniature survey rakes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – A {{broadband}} {{single element}} transducer was constructed from single crystal PMN-PT and tested to de-termine {{the feasibility of}} using this material for simultane-ous sub-harmonic and second harmonic imaging. The transducer consisted of a 1 - 3 PMN-PT/epoxy composite with two quarter wave matching layers and a backing. The transducer face was spherically curved to yield a 53 mm focal point. The <b>transducer’s</b> <b>impulse</b> response had a center frequency of 5. 2 MHz and- 6 dB bandwidth over 130 %. The transmit response for tone burst excitation indicated a shift in center frequency to 6. 5 MHz and a- 6 dB bandwidth of 100 %. Receive sensitivity was high {{at the lower end}} of the band and decreased with increasing frequency; this behavior was probably due to electrical impedance mismatch. Contrast agent testing using Sona-zoid ® showed that the second harmonic could be easily detected. The sub-harmonic was not detected due to the center frequency shift under tone burst excitation. Simul-taneous sub and second harmonic testing could probably be accomplished with a lower center frequency and better electrical impedance matching. I...|$|R
40|$|Iterative image {{reconstruction}} algorithms for {{optoacoustic tomography}} (OAT), {{also known as}} photoacoustic tomography, {{have the ability to}} improve image quality over analytic algorithms due to their ability to incorporate accurate models of the imaging physics, instrument response, and measurement noise. However, to date, there have been few reported attempts to employ advanced iterative image reconstruction algorithms for improving image quality in three-dimensional (3 D) OAT. In this work, we implement and investigate two iterative image reconstruction methods for use with a 3 D OAT small animal imager: namely, a penalized least-squares (PLS) method employing a quadratic smoothness penalty and a PLS method employing a total variation norm penalty. The reconstruction algorithms employ accurate models of the ultrasonic <b>transducer</b> <b>impulse</b> responses. Experimental data sets are employed to compare the performances of the iterative reconstruction algorithms to that of a 3 D filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm. By use of quantitative measures of image quality, we demonstrate that the iterative reconstruction algorithms can mitigate image artifacts and preserve spatial resolution more effectively than FBP algorithms. These features suggest that the use of advanced image reconstruction algorithms can improve the effectiveness of 3 D OAT while reducing the amount of data required for biomedical applications...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} paper, {{the superiority of}} linear FM signals was shown in terms of {{signal-to-noise}} ratio and robustness to tissue attenuation. This second paper in the series of three papers on the application of coded excitation signals in medical ultrasound presents design methods of linear FM signals and mismatched filters, {{in order to meet}} the higher demands on resolution in ultrasound imaging. It is shown that for the small time-bandwidth (TB) products available in ultrasound, the rectangular spectrum approximation is not valid, which reduces the effectiveness of weighting. Additionally, the distant range sidelobes are associated with the ripples of the spectrum amplitude and, thus, cannot be removed by weighting. Ripple reduction is achieved through amplitude or phase predistortion of the transmitted signals. Mismatched filters are designed to efficiently use the available bandwidth and at the same time to be insensitive to the <b>transducer's</b> <b>impulse</b> response. With these techniques, temporal sidelobes are kept below 60 to 100 dB, image contrast is improved by reducing the energy within the sidelobe region, and axial resolution is preserved. The method is evaluated first for resolution performance and axial sidelobes through simulations with the program Field II. A coded excitation ultrasound imaging system based on a commercial scanner and a 4 MHz probe driven by coded sequences is presented and used for the clinical evaluation of the coded excitation/compression scheme. The clinical images show a significant improvement in penetration depth and contrast, while they preserve both axial and lateral resolution. At the maximum acquisition depth of 15 cm, there is an improvement of more than 10 dB in, the signal-to-noise ratio of the images. The paper also presents acquired images, using complementary Golay codes, that show the deleterious effects of attenuation on binary codes when processed with a matched filter, also confirmed by presented simulated images. © 2005 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|In {{ultrasound}} imaging, the axial resolution {{depends on}} the source bandwidth. Recently, a novel coded excitation and pulse compression technique, known as Resolution Enhancement Compression (REC), was developed. REC enhances the - 6 dB bandwidth of an ultrasonic imaging system. In this dissertation, {{the limitations of the}} REC technique were explored and specific imaging applications were examined. Several factors that could limit the improvements in ultrasonic imaging afforded by REC were assessed. First, it was hypothesized that a Wiener filter could adversely affect the compression performance of coded excitation because it had the potential to boost the harmonics due to nonlinear distortion. When the Wiener filter operated near an inverse filter the harmonics were boosted, resulting in increased sidelobes. Pre-filtering of the harmonics was found to solve this problem. Second, it was hypothesized that the larger the bandwidth boost desired, the smaller the voltage that could be applied at the center frequency. When doubling the bandwidth, the center frequency voltage was 6 dB below the band edges of the pre-enhanced chirp. Finally, the effects of attenuation were evaluated. Because of the attenuation, a larger shift in the center frequency due to the larger bandwidth was identified. Several applications for the REC technique in biomedical imaging were explored. It was hypothesized that the variance of the speckle could be reduced further when using frequency compounding and REC. By using the bandwidth enhancement delivered by REC, the trade off between improved contrast and axial resolution was extended. Similarly, REC was combined with quantitative ultrasound (QUS) techniques to improve parametric images of estimated scatterer diameter. Larger bandwidths were observed to lead to a smaller variance in spectral estimates, thereby improving QUS image contrast. Finally, novel techniques for improving the compression of codes in ultrasonic imaging were developed and assessed. The effects of the spatially varying nature of a <b>transducer???s</b> <b>impulse</b> response and echo signal-to-noise ratio (eSNR) throughout the depth of field of the source were evaluated. Significant improvements in image quality were realized through the use of Wiener filters that accounted for the spatially varying eSNR...|$|R
