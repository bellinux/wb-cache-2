40|$|The authors {{describe}} an innovative EID technique {{based on the}} application of a HDX <b>injectable</b> <b>transponder</b> (32, 5 x 3, 8 mm) in 47 sardinian suckling kids. The technique was experimented on 1 - 5 days old animals whose live weight ranged between 1, 500 e 3, 400 Kg. The trial aimed to verify: 1) the consequences of transponder application in vivo and post mortem; 2) the readability of the transponder; 3) the behavioural changes or clinical effects due to the presence of the transponder in abdomen cavity; 4) the recovery technique of the transponder after slaughtering. The readability of the transponder was evaluated in each animal using a portable reader immediately after his application and at 1 d, 7 d, 14 d and 28 d following {{as well as at the}} slaughtering. No changes in the health status and behaviour of animals was observed. The readability was 100 % throughout controls performed in vivo as well as post mortem. The intraperitoneal electronic identification can represents an interesting method to improve the traceability of kids and meat. JRC. G. 7 -Traceability and vulnerability assessmen...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Identification and {{monitoring}} of farm animals are effective tools for traceability. Current livestock identification {{systems are not}} 100 % efficient and present certain disadvantages such as losses, breakages and an unreadable identification code. The use of <b>injectable</b> <b>transponders</b> may be a reliable method for individual identification, providing an improvement in data recording and farm management. The aim of this experiment was to evaluate the practical aspects concerning injection technique, readability and retrieval of <b>injectable</b> <b>transponders</b> in live rabbits. A total of 60 rabbits (40 fatteners and 20 does) were injected with 23 x 3 mm passive FDX-B transponders (Datamars, Switzerland), inserted into a needle, wrapped in a sterilised package and applied by a specific injector (Planet ID, Germany). Two different body sites were evaluated: back scapular (n= 30) and armpit (n= 30) position. The readings of the transponders were performed by using an i-max plus portable reader (Datamars, Switzerland) at different times: before and after injection, one day, one week and one month after injection. Does were read monthly during 1 year, while fatteners before the slaughtering process. To evaluate the effect on productive performance, fattening rabbits were compared to a control group. The readability of transponders injected in fatteners until slaughter and in does until 1 year after injection was 100 %. No harmful effects were observed and {{no significant difference in}} weight was found in the two injection groups, compared with the control group. The retrieval was performed by a singl...|$|R

40|$|Individual {{identification}} in pigs is a {{key point}} for management, traceability and trade control. The aim of this experiment was to study retention rate and functionality of electronic identification systems in pigs, injected in different sites, to evaluate traceability of animals and highlight histopathological alterations of tissues in different inoculation sites. A total of 60 crossbred piglets were used to compare different transponder inoculation sites. One group (15 piglets) was identified only by plastic ear tags; and three groups were identified by passive <b>injectable</b> <b>transponders</b> (PIT) with different inoculation sites. Pigs were slaughtered in two different moments, in order to evaluate injection sites, macroscopically and histologically, either 50 days after injection or at a normal slaughtering weight. In general, no apparent animal health problems were observed {{the day after the}} injection or during the control readings performed during the experiment. Intraperitoneal localization gave excellent results in term of readability until the slaughter time. Transponders at the slaughter line were always recovered in the viscera tray because they were found loose in the peritoneal cavity. In some cases, they were found on the carcasses, attached to the peritoneum. In those cases a sample of peritoneal tissue was collected for histological examination. A reparative chronic reaction with moderate and multifocal fibrosis and neoformed vessels associated to multifocal and mild lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate were detected. In one case (6. 7 %) the transponder was found on the visceral side of the liver and the histological examination highlighted a localized superficial hepatic atrophy by compression. Retroauricolar site of injection gave lower readability results because 2 transponders (13. 3 %) were no more readable during the first month after injection. No lesions were found with this inoculation site. PIT injected in the perineal region were operative until slaughter time. Recovery procedures at the slaughter house were simple for animals slaughtered at a low weight, but much more difficult in the case of heavy pigs. Moreover, in three cases (20 %), PITs were no more in the subcutaneous tissue but they had an intramuscular localization. The histological examination of the muscles revealed a chronic reparative process. In our experiment, <b>injectable</b> <b>transponders</b> in the intraperitoneal position provided the best identification system for pigs. Histopathological examination revealed only local reparative processes in the tissues interested by PIT contact, and no other pathological changes...|$|R

This research had the objective of monitoring the behavior of female broiler breeders, using the technology of radio-frequency, <b>injectable</b> <b>transponders</b> and readers in different existing microclimates inside a small scale distorted housing model. Eight birds with electronic identification were used. Three readers were used, in three different points inside the model: {{on the floor of the}} nest, in the passage besides the lateral wall and below the water facility. Dry bulb (DBT), wet bulb (WBT) and black globe (BGT) temperature were measured continuously. The results point out a distinct behavioral pattern of the birds regarding the environment exposition during the experiment. Three probabilistic models of behavior were developed from the recorded data: probabilistic model for the passage use: FP = 1. 10 - 0. 244 ln(DBT), probabilistic model for the water facility use: FB = 0. 398 + 0. 00866 (DBT), and probabilistic model for the nest use: FN = 2. 22 - 0. 272 DBT + 0, 011 DBT 2 - 0. 000144 DBT 3...|$|R
40|$|Reliability, {{efficacy}} and {{the efficiency of}} EID of animals according to RFID technology were assessed across different animal production filiere. Accident occurrence, un-detectability of electronic code, as well as technical aspects due to different types of devices deployed were considered before setting up a cost/benefit analysis of the system based on RFID technology for traceability purposes. A coded manual {{of operations for the}} electronic identification of animals in the practice on a large scale according different electronic devices (<b>injectable</b> <b>transponders</b> or ceramic boluses) was implemented. An experimental Help Desk Service (HDS) was created as a practical support concerning animal welfare, veterinary aspects and losses/breakages of electronic identifiers. An evolution of the system to check performance of RFID technology in farms was due to the detection of bolus/transponders presence in animals body by digitalized X-ray analysis, thus allowing a sound check for operators and for reliability assessment. A very weak point was identified in a consistent loss (36. 9 %) of miniboluses (20 g) in goats, after 2 years from the first electronic identification. The SWOT analysis showed that the adoption of RFID technology for animal identification is a good tool for traceability of animals and improving farm management and a concrete help to solve on field problems during hard fieldwork operations...|$|R
40|$|Radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) {{systems were}} introduced in the 1970 ies mainly for farm management purposes. They were followed in the 1990 ies {{by the use of}} <b>injectable</b> <b>transponders</b> for companion animals. Since the beginning of this age, many countries have introduced animal identification schemes based upon RFID. The technology, its use and the testing of the equipment are defined in ISO standards. The International Committee for Animal Recording (ICAR) is the international registration authority for animal RFID and publishes approved products on its Website (www. icar. org). The low frequency signal is not influenced by body tissue, so the transponder technology can be used as eartag, injectable, bolus and leg tag. The RFID transponder itself does not give information about the animal or the owner of the animal, but the identification code (ID-code) links the animal to related information (of the animal and the owner) in a database. The database can be hosted on the farm, by the manufacturer of the RFID transponder or by a national body. A central database on a national level is preferable over a database on farm level, because tracking and tracing is much quicker and more effective, and other systems (such as herd book, Health Service) can be easily linked to it. The allocation of ID-codes being produced must be registered in a database to eliminate the risk of having identical ID-code for different animals. Depending on the coding of the transponder (country code or manufacturer code), the legal authority or the manufacturer of the transponders is responsible for maintaining such a database. At this stage, low frequency RFID technology is generally considered as the most efficient technology for identifying animals...|$|R
40|$|The {{technology}} for electronic identification (ID) of bovines is currently available {{with the advent}} of passive electronic transponders. At issue is the most appropriate method to attach the electronic ID to the animals. The options include an electronic button tag in the ear, an implantable electronic chip in the ear base or an electronic bolus placed in the rumen/reticular via the oesophageal route. • Aseries of experiments which compared different implantation sites for electronic chips found that the most suitable site for implantation was under the scutellar cartridge of the ear. This site gave very good retention values and was also a secure site, however, {{it was not possible to}} palpate the transponder. • The recovery of <b>injectable</b> <b>transponders</b> post slaughter was problematic and as a result due to potential risk of implantable transponder entering the food chain it was not possible to recommend the injectable (implantable route). • Electronic rumen boluses with a specific density less than 2 were rapidly expelled from the rumen, with 100 % expulsion by day 56 following placement in the reticulo-rumen. • Rumen boluses with a specific density of 2. 75 and greater had an annual non reading rate of less than 1 %, however, the loss rate in adult beef cows was greater than in growing and finishing cattle. The reason for this difference was unclear and may be diet related. • Recovery of boluses at slaughter was undertaken in the offal hall and generally the bolus was present in the reticulum and was easily detected by palpating the reticulum. One hundred percent recovery was not achieved in practice, various unforseen events including accidental dislodgment and cutting techniques prevented recovery. • Abolus dispenser with a long connection will facilitate delivery of the bolus directly to the calf’s reticulum. • Electronic failure of transponders in the reticulo-rumen was not a problem and read-failure rate was associated with boluses expelled from the reticulo-rumen. • There was no differences in read-failure rate (or loss rate) between two commercial boluses which were compared in different catgories of cattle. • Electronic button tags from two commercial companies were compared and it was found that any difference between the electronic button ear tags was associated with a defective applicator taggers. • Overall, the animal loss rate for electronic button tags was somewhat higher than that reported for electronic rumen boluses.

40|$|Following {{the recent}} {{outbreaks}} of livestock diseases in Europe, {{the identification and}} registration of individual animals has become {{an essential element of}} the EU´s livestock management programme. The European Council has put into place regulations that stipulate that all animal products consumed in Europe shall be traceable from birth to slaughterhouse. These have far-reaching consequences for both EU Member States and meat-exporting ACP countries, which will have to comply by introducing fail-safe tracking systems for all their livestock. ICTs, and particularly electronic identification devices, will be essential components of such systems. On the EU side, the European Commission has shown an interest in using ICTs for livestock identification purposes since the early 1990 s. In 1998, the Commission approved a large-scale project called IDEA (Identification Electronique des Animaux). As part of IDEA, one million farm animals were electronically identified, involving more than 6000 farms and 70 slaughterhouses in six EU countries. Between 1998 and 2001, the project examined the performance of three electronic tagging systems - ear tags, the stomach bolus and <b>injectable</b> <b>transponders</b> - for cattle, buffaloes, sheep and goats. The IDEA project showed that electronic identification devices are far more efficient and cost-effective than traditional methods, and would improve livestock management systems. Based on the final report of the IDEA project, in 2002 the Commission submitted a draft proposal for a Council regulation: ´Establishing a system for the identification and registration of ovine and caprine animals´ (COM(2002) 729). This regulation seeks to establish a mechanism for the permanent tagging of sheep and goats throughout Europe. This is a first legislative step towards the adoption of electronic identification for all farm animals. Meat-exporting ACP countries are also showing interest in electronic tracking systems for their livestock. In Botswana, for example, the Ministry of Agriculture has introduced the Livestock Identification Trace-back System (LITS) for the identification of millions of cattle to be exported to the EU (see elsewhere in this issue). In line with the IDEA project´s findings, the ministry decided to opt for electronic tagging instead of traditional identification methods in order to comply with the regulation currently in force (1760 / 2000) on beef labelling. LITS is likely to set a standard for the effective, daily use of ICTs in livestock identification procedures, and its progress will be closely watched by the cattle industry in the rest of Africa and, indeed, the EU. mailto:christophe. korn@jrc. it Christophe Korn is part of the European Commission´s Joint Research Centre, [URL] text="Institute for the Protection and Security of the Citizen" /.

40|$|What are {{the core}} {{activities}} of the FSC? The FSC is an international non-profit organization that was founded in 1993 to introduce an international forest certification scheme and {{to act as an}} accreditation body. Forest certification is the process of inspecting particular forests or woodland to see if they are being managed according to an agreed set of strict ecological, economic and social criteria or standards. The FSC does not itself certify forest operations or manufacturers. These important activities are carried out by independent, FSC-accredited certification bodies in more than 30 countries. An important component of forest certification is product or chain-of-custody (CoC) verification. CoC is the process through which the source of a timber product is verified. In order to qualify for the FSC trademark, timber products must be traceable from the forest through all the steps in the production process until they reach the end user. The FSC provides producers with international labelling standards to facilitate this process. Over the past few decades, CoC labelling processes have greatly benefited from ICTs. How have CoC methods evolved? The oldest methods of wood labelling involved painting or chiselling company information and ID numbers onto a tree, or on one or both ends of a log. Such labels are commonly used in conjunction with paper records on tree or log species, dimensions and volume. More recently, ICTs are providing increasingly sophisticated means of labelling, as well as more efficient tools for tracking and storing additional information about timber products. The first major technological leap was the bar-coded label. Bar-coded data can be instantly read by a handheld scanner, stored electronically and transferred to a computer for analyses of stock inventories, for example. Bar-coded labels are increasingly being used to identify individual logs, particularly in countries that export high-value logs, and it is important to capture export revenues. Another key development has been the emergence of labels containing radio frequency identification (RFID) transceivers that receive and transmit data by radio signals. A handheld scanner can instruct any RFID label to transmit its data through a coded signal. The scanner may then be plugged into a computer and the data downloaded for further analysis. An important advantage of RFID systems for log tracking is that the data signals can be read rapidly, remotely and under difficult conditions. Also, RFID labels can store a large amount of data {{with a high level of}} security - they are difficult to counterfeit or tamper with. The tags come in a variety of forms, including plastic cards and tiny <b>injectable</b> <b>transponders.</b> On the down side, available radio frequencies vary from country to country, so there are currently no internationally standardized RFID technologies. What´s more, RFID labels are still too expensive for labelling individual logs and processed bundles of wood. What advanced technologies are now being used to capture data? CoC systems require careful documentation and record keeping, including files related to stock inventories and inspections, transport documentation, and retail and distribution records. The forestry industry has developed extensive databases to manage these records more effectively. Also, Global Positioning System (GPS) technology has had a major impact on this aspect of the CoC. GPS is commonly used in forest inventories to delineate the boundaries of forested areas and to determine field locations, but can also be used to track shipments of logs and timber products and to provide estimated delivery times. Microchip cards, or ´smart cards´, and magnetic strip cards are also very useful. These pieces of plastic can store large amounts of data and have built-in security features - they are ideal replacements for paper records and make the logistics of tracking timber products much more efficient. Finally, how is the FSC using ICTs to disseminate information? As an international network, the FSC relies on electronic communication to reach its 500 members and 33 national offices, in addition to annual face-to-face meetings. The FSC provides information in both Spanish and English to reach its stakeholders in the South, and has recently launched a new website and intranet. All relevant new developments are announced in the monthly FSC email newsletter News+Notes, which is sent to more than 4000 subscribers around the world. Moreover, the FSC has set up a hotline to answer questions, and has created a number of web-based forums so that stakeholders can more easily exchange information regarding the Council´s policies, consultations and other issues related to forest management. Taken together, these initiatives form part of a concerted, ongoing effort on the part of the FSC to increase awareness of the many benefits of forest certification - now and in the future. mailto:andra@fscoax. org Zandra Martinez is FSC media officer.
