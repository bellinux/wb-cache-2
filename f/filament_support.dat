5000|$|Antifuses {{are best}} known for their use in mini-light (or miniature) style {{low-voltage}} Christmas tree lights. Ordinarily (for operation from mains voltages), the lamps are wired in series. (The larger, traditional, C7 and C9 style lights are wired in parallel and are rated to operate directly at mains voltage.) Because the series string would be rendered inoperable by a single lamp failing, each bulb has an antifuse installed within it. When the bulb blows, the entire mains voltage is applied across the single blown lamp. This rapidly causes the antifuse to short out the blown bulb, allowing the series circuit to resume functioning, albeit with {{a larger proportion of}} the mains voltage now applied to each of the remaining lamps. The antifuse is made using wire with a high resistance coating and this wire is coiled over the two vertical <b>filament</b> <b>support</b> wires inside the bulb. The insulation of the antifuse wire withstands the ordinary low voltage imposed across a functioning lamp but rapidly breaks down under the full mains voltage, giving the antifuse action.

40|$|Abstract — The {{implosion}} of sealed glass vessels — such as fishing floats, laboratory glassware, {{and various}} bottles — {{under the influence}} of hydrostatic pressure at depth in the ocean has long been known to produce moderately loud acoustic events. Common light bulbs have also been fre-quently used in practice, but it appears that the use of these particular vessels has not been described in the scientific jour-nals. In fact, most users of light bulbs have no information on the crush depths, source level, and spectral content of the radiated signal. The aim {{of this paper is to}} remedy this short-coming, to describe the use of common light bulbs as acous-tic sources, and to provide guidance to researchers on the source level, spectrum, and usage of common sizes of light bulbs and fluorescent lighting tubes. With the current fo-cus on shallow-water operations, bearing in mind the prohi-bition against the use of all but the smallest explosives, im-ploding light bulbs may be the most cost-effective acoustic source at depths under 300 m that minimizes environmental impact.

These oscillations, reminiscent of prokaryotic and eukaryotic flagellar motion, are obtained without having to invoke structural complexity or biochemical regulation. This minimality implies that biomimetic oscillations, previously observed only in complex bundles of active filaments, can be replicated in simple chains of generic chemomechanically active beads.

40|$|T cell {{activation}} {{and especially}} trafficking of T cell receptor microclusters during immunological synapse formation are widely thought {{to rely on}} cytoskeletal remodeling. However, important details on the involvement of actin in the latter transport processes are missing. Using a suite of advanced optical microscopes to analyze resting and activated T cells, we show that, following contact formation with activating surfaces, these cells sequentially rearrange their cortical actin across the entire cell, creating a previously unreported ramifying actin network above the immunological synapse. This network shows all the characteristics of an inward-growing transportation network and its dynamics correlating with T cell receptor rearrangements. This actin reorganization is accompanied {{by an increase in}} the nanoscale actin meshwork size and the dynamic adjustment of the turnover times and filament lengths of two differently sized filamentous actin populations, wherein formin-mediated long actin <b>filaments</b> <b>support</b> a very flat and stiff contact at the immunological synapse interface.

Gain- and loss-of-function experiments support a major role of K 5 in desmosome stability control via protein kinase C alpha. Our data show that keratin isotypes differently and specifically regulate wound healing and invasion by modulating intercellular adhesion...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} {{experimental}} and numerical investigations of femtosecond pulse propagation locally {{disturbed by the}} turbulent flow field of a hot-air blower. The experiments show that turbulence may shorten the collapse/filamentation distance and induce the onset of multiple <b>filaments.</b> This is <b>supported</b> by numerical simulations indicating that the high spatial frequency part of the turbulence spectrum plays a significant role...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{localize}} activated {{protein kinase}} C (PKC) in smooth muscle cells, an antibody {{directed to the}} catalytic site of the enzyme {{was used to assess}} PKC distribution by immunofluorescence techniques in gastric smooth muscle cells isolated from Bufo marinus. An antibody to vinculin was used to delineate the cell membrane. High-resolution three-dimensional images of immunofluorescence were obtained from a series of images collected through focus with a digital imaging microscope. Cells were untreated or treated with agents that increase PKC activity (10 μM carbachol for 1 min, 1 μM phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) for 10 min), or have no effect on PKC activity (1 μm 4 -α phorbol, 12, 13 -didecanoate (4 -α PMA)). In unstimulated cells, activated PKC and vinculin were located and organized at the cell surface. Cell cytosol labeling for activated PKC was sparse and diffuse and was absent for vinculin. After treatment with carbachol, which stimulates contraction and PKC activity, in addition to the membrane localization, the activated PKC exhibited a pronounced cytosolic fibrillar distribution and an increased total fluorescence intensity relative to vinculin. The distributions of activated PKC observed after PMA but not 4 -α PMA were similar to those observed with carbachol. Our results indicate that in resting cells there is a pool of activated PKC near the cell membrane, and that after stimulation activated PKC is no longer membrane-confined, but is present throughout the cytosol. Active PKC appears to associate with contractile <b>filaments,</b> <b>supporting</b> a possible role in modulation of contraction...|$|R
40|$|Using Chandra and HST we {{show that}} X-ray and Hα {{filaments}} that form the 1. 3 -kpc diameter superbubble of NGC 3079 have strikingly similar patterns at 0. " 8 resolution. This tight match seems to arise from cool disk gas that {{has been driven by}} the wind, with X-rays being emitted from upstream, stand-off bowshocks or by conductive cooling at the cloud/wind interfaces. We find that the soft X-ray plasma has thermal and kinetic energies of 2 × 10 ^ 56 √(η_x) and 5 × 10 ^ 54 √(η_X) erg respectively, where η_X is the filling factor of the X-ray gas and may be small; these are comparable to the energies of the optical line-emitting gas. X-rays are also seen {{from the base of the}} radio counterbubble that is obscured optically by the galaxy disk, and from the nucleus (whose spectrum shows the Fe Kα line). Hydrodynamical simulations reproduce the obbservations well using large filling factors within both filament systems; assuming otherwise seriously underestimates the mass loss in the superwind. The superbubble is surrounded by a fainter conical halo of X-rays that fill the area delineated by high angle, Hα-emitting <b>filaments,</b> <b>supporting</b> our previous assertion that these filaments form the contact discontinuity/shock between galaxy gas and shocked wind. About 40 (3 kpc) above the disk, an X-ray arc may partially close beyond the bubble, but the north-east quadrant remains open, consistent with the superwind having broken out into at least the galaxy halo.
