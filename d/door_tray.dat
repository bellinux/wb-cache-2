50|$|However, {{the same}} is not true for trays. Even {{in the case of}} {{frameless}} construction doors and their hinges when open block a portion of the interior cabinet width. Since trays are mounted behind the <b>door,</b> <b>trays</b> are typically significantly narrower than drawers. Special hinges are available that can permit trays of similar width as drawers but they have not come into wide use.|$|R
30|$|The target {{materials}} and preparation methods {{were the same}} as for COLLIDE (see “COLLIDE” section for details). The only difference with the COLLIDE targets is an additional contraption on the <b>tray</b> <b>door</b> that slightly compresses the target after preparation and through the pre-flight handling process. As the PRIME <b>tray</b> <b>doors</b> open by rotation rather than sliding, a plate was attached on the inner side facing the sample. Using four weak springs, this plate applies pressure on the target sample when the <b>tray</b> <b>door</b> is closed. In this way, the sample is jammed and its porosity remains unchanged (0.4 to 0.5 as described in “COLLIDE” section) during loading of the experiment boxes onto the aircraft.|$|R

6000|$|... "C'est ici," [...] quoth Gambouge, hastening to {{open the}} door. He did so; and lo! there was a restaurateur's boy at the <b>door,</b> {{supporting}} a <b>tray,</b> a tin-covered dish, and plates on the same; and, by its side, a tall amber-colored flask of Sauterne.|$|R
60|$|As {{he entered}} the dining-hall, he saw Dates {{retiring}} from another <b>door</b> with his <b>tray.</b> Alone and meditative, by the bared half of the polished table, sat his mother at her dessert; fruit-baskets, and a decanter were before her. On the other leaf of the same table, still lay the cloth, folded back upon itself, and set out with one plate and its usual accompaniments.|$|R
60|$|Wyllard {{went out}} to harness his team, {{and he did not}} notice that Sally, who had {{approached}} the <b>door</b> with a <b>tray</b> in her hands a moment or two earlier, drew back before him softly. When he had crossed the room she set down the tray and, with her cheeks burning, leaned upon the table. Then, feeling that she could not stay in the stove-heated room, she went out, and stood in the slushy snow. One of her hands was tightly closed, and all the color had vanished from her cheeks. However, she contrived to give Hawtrey his supper by and by, and soon afterwards drove away.|$|R
50|$|Cabinets were in {{the rear}} {{quarters}} beside the two rear seats; one held cocktail equipment, including cut glass decanters, glasses and thermos jugs, while the other held picnic equipment, including Perspex sandwich boxes, cups, saucers, and linen. A folding table was fitted in {{the centre of the}} front seat, a manicure set in the passenger door recess, and an ivory-handled nylon umbrella in {{the lower part of the}} passenger <b>door.</b> A sliding <b>tray</b> under the passenger side of the dashboard held a folding mirror, a clothes brush, a comb, a powder compact, a cigarette case, and a cream jar. The boot held rawhide suitcases with gilt Bramah locks.|$|R
6000|$|My pal {{delivered}} the goods. After {{two days of}} work in the yard I was taken out of my cell and made a trusty, a [...] "hall-man." [...] At morning and night we served the bread to the prisoners in their cells; but at twelve o'clock a different method was used. The convicts marched in from work in a long line. As they entered the door of our hall, they broke the lock-step and took their hands down from the shoulders of their line-mates. Just inside the <b>door</b> were piled <b>trays</b> of bread, and here also stood the First Hall-man and two ordinary hall-men. I was one of the two. Our task was to hold the trays of bread as the line of convicts filed past. As soon as the tray, say, that I was holding was emptied, the other hall-man took my place with a full tray. And when his was emptied, I took his place with a full tray. Thus the line tramped steadily by, each man reaching with his right hand and taking one ration of bread from the extended tray.|$|R
5000|$|In August 2003, he {{and seven}} other prisoners held {{a hunger strike}} to protest prison conditions. As a result, Hernández was moved to Kilo 5½ prison in Pinar del Río, more than 400 miles from Camagüey. In a prison essay in which he {{described}} in detail the meals he was given, Hernández wrote that “prisoners in Cuba are being held in conditions similar to pigs in a pigsty.” [...] In March 2004, Hernández’s wife, Yaraí Reyes Marín, was given permission to visit him and traveled to Pinar del Rio. At the prison she was stripped and interrogated and denied access to her husband. She also found out that Hernández had allegedly been beaten by the prison's security chief. He was in very poor health, but was being denied medical care. In December 2006, Hernández suffered fainting spells and {{was admitted to the}} Amalia Simoni Provincial Hospital in Camagüey. Although he was in critical condition, he was kept for a week in a room without a bed, table, or chair, where he sat on a bucket and had his food pushed under the <b>door</b> on a <b>tray.</b> On December 27, 2006, Hernández was sent from the hospital to Kilo 7 prison in Camagüey {{on the grounds that the}} hospital lacked the resources needed to treat him. In prison, his health further deteriorated and he lost over 35 pounds. On September 14, 2007, Hernández was transferred from Kilo 7 Prison to the Carlos J. Finlay Military Hospital in Havana, where he was diagnosed with several digestive ailments.|$|R
40|$|Loss on {{ignition}} (LOI) {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used methods for measuring organic matter content in soils but does not have a universal standard protocol. A large number of factors may influence its accuracy, such as furnace type, sample mass, duration and temperature of ignition and clay content of samples. We conducted a series of experiments to quantify these effects, which enabled us to derive (i) guidelines for ignition conditions (sample mass, duration and temperature), (ii) temperature-specific soil organic matter (SOM) to soil organic carbon (SOC) conversion factors and (iii) clay content-dependent correction factors for structural water loss (SWL). Bulk samples of a sandy soil (4 % clay) and a silt loam soil (25 % clay) were used to evaluate the effects of ignition conditions. Samples with a range of clay contents (0 - 50 %) were used to quantify conversion and correction factors. Two furnaces, one without and one with pre-heated air, did not show significant differences in terms of within-batch LOI variability. In both furnaces less combustion occurred close to the <b>door,</b> which necessitated <b>tray</b> turning at half-time as this reduced the standard deviation per batch significantly. Variation in mass loss declined exponentially with sample mass (range, 0. 15 - 20 g). The LOI increased with duration at lower temperatures (≤ 550 °C) for the sandy soil. At greater temperatures (600 and 650 °C), no effect of duration was found. For the silt loam soil, LOI values increased with duration for each temperature, which was attributed to SWL. The SOM to SOC conversion factor decreased strongly with temperature at an ignition duration of 3 hours from 0. 70 (350 °C) to 0. 57 (500 °C) and stabilized around 0. 55 between 550 and 650 °C, indicating that at temperatures ≥ 550 °C all SOM had been removed. The clay correction factor for SWL increased from 0. 01 to 0. 09 as the temperature of ignition increased from 350 to 650 °C. To minimize within-batch LOI variation we recommend a standard ignition duration of 3 hours, tray turning at half-time, a sample mass ≥ 20 g and temperatures equal to or greater than 550 °C. To avoid over-estimates of SOM through structural water loss, the presented SWL correction procedure should always be applied. </p...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of my activity, {{was to create}} a mobile platform with a focus on two aspects: teaching and some particular applications in the real world. Regarding education, the fundamental choice has been to develop internally most of the components rather than acquire them from third parties; this choice has encouraged the full knowledge of every single part of the mobot, whether mechanical, hw or sw, leaving open any future development and replication of the system. The result is a device on which you can conduct research in mobile robotics and articial intelligence, enabling students to gain experience in the field of automatic controls at various levels of development: sw, fw, hw and mechanic. As regards the real world applications, special attention was paid to two areas of employ of these devices: the mobot for service (i. e <b>trays</b> <b>door</b> mobot, surveillance staff, [...] .) and assistance to disabled and elderly people. Following are reported some of the main aspects that have characterized SabotOne development. - The name SabotOne Sabot is the acronym for Scalable mobot (i. e mobile robots). The main focus which drive the design of each component, {{was to create a}} modular system allowing expandability of mobot. - Machanics The design of the mechanical parts has been made through the 3 D-CAD modeling. All the parts were then made from aluminum and assembled to form the entire SabotOne device. The platforms are modular, providing accommodation of the electronics in the lower levels, leaving the higher ones to specific uses depending on field of use of the mobot. The kinematics of the mobot, reects the unicycle physical model which provides mobility of the device even in tight spaces and is very similar to that of wheelchairs for the disabled people. - Electronics It has been designed and realized a board for electrical axis control in position loop. The board can control two direct current motors used in the mobot traction. It was realized firmware and designed the communication protocols in order to make this card appropriate in robotics applications in which it was used. The board has been equipped with signal condition electronic to provide acquisition of sensory signals (A/D converter, GPIO). Moreover, three communication protocols are made available on the board: CAN, TCP/IP (802. 11 b/g, RJ 45) and Modbus on RS 485. On the ethernet interface a web server is available to set conguration parameters board, while the serial interface enable the board to exchange information with a smart unit such as an embedded-pc equipped with an operating system. - Software Development of Sabot Workbench It is a tool that is used to remote monitoring all Sabots connected to a network. It was developed using the modern framework Eclipse Java-RCP. This framework has enabled the modeling of all the features of the Workbench through the paradigm of the plugin. This allows to add functionality to the application without having to modify the application core. Design of Communication protocol between Workbench and Sabot It is based on Jabber/XMPP protocol and the specification SensML/SWE (designed by Open Geospatial Consor- tium). It is designed to integrate XMPP (used as information carrier) and SensML/SWE that defines the ontologies for describing measurable phenomena and relative sensors. It has been dened the concept of identity of a controlled system and integrated within XMPP protocol. The SensML specification has been extended to support the concept of actuator. The protocol designed, was denoted with the acronym ControlML. Development of trajectory control, path planning and autolocalization algorithms Path planning has been developed in C++ implementing LPN algorithm. It was built a sim- ulator to verify the algorithm efficiency and completeness. It has seen that the algorithm is complete (can always and a path toward a target qual'ora this exists) and is efficient (planning a course in less than 100 ms over a space partitioned into 10. 000 cells). The trajectory control was achieved by implementing two different algorithms, the first based on pseudoinversion of dynamic system characterized from non-holonomic constraints, the second conducted by the dy- namic feedback linearization. It was built a simulator to verify the tracking error of controllers and we have seen that both controllers are able to undo the following error. For autolocalization, it has been acquired an inertial platform on which was implemented a Kalman Filter for the" of various sensory data (accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers). It has seen that the inertial data should have to be " with references to absolute position (feature extracted from images or RFID tag) because of the intrinsic drift of inertial sensors. Development of SabotSabot smart unit software architecture It has been designed and developed an abstaction of operating system using object oriented paradigm (design pattern) to decouple the application-level from O. S adopted in this application (linux). It has developed an architecture that can realize the concept of run-time plugin by lazy-loading of libraries in linux. In this framework are integrated the algorithms for planning trajectory, for autolocalizing and avoiding obstacle. The communication protocol ControlML takes care to keep in touch the Sabots and the control stations with Workbench. The framework was designed in UML language using strategies oriented to Items and criteria for Pattern" and time design pattern" inertial sensors...|$|R
