30|$|From the {{mathematical}} expression in Eq. (7), {{the relationship between}} the receive time and other parameters cannot be explicitly evaluated without restrictive assumptions on the arrival process and the time-varying channel states. Thus, we can not obtain a mathematically optimal solution of the above problem in its most generic form. Due to this, we develop a heuristic suboptimal solution, which <b>jointly</b> <b>performs</b> RB assignment and packet scheduling by employing our proposed utility function.|$|R
30|$|The CAWF {{is able to}} <b>jointly</b> <b>perform</b> {{denoising}} and deblurring. We {{believe this}} type of joint restoration is advantageous, compared with decoupling these operations. The CAWF algorithm is also capable of adapting to local signal and noise variance. Bad or missing pixels can easily be accommodated by leaving {{them out of the}} multi-patch observation vector and corresponding correlation statistics. The weights will adapt in a non-trivial way to the missing pixels [5, 9, 10].|$|R

Upon the quartet's visit to Berkeley, California in the mid-1930s, Khuner chose Berkeley as the ideal place to live. He liked the cool Mediterranean climate. He met his future wife, Gertrude, in New York, and they wed in California in 1942.

50|$|Although it {{is called}} Beijing opera, its origins are not in Beijing but in the Chinese provinces of Anhui and Hubei. Beijing opera got its two main melodies, Xipi and Erhuang, from Anhui and Hubei operas. Much {{dialogue}} is also carried out in an archaic dialect originating partially from those regions. It also absorbed music and arias from other operas and musical arts such as the historic Qinqiang. It is regarded that Beijing Opera was born when the Four Great Anhui Troupes came to Beijing in 1790. Beijing opera was originally staged for the court and came into the public later. In 1828, some famous Hubei troupes came to Beijing. They often <b>jointly</b> <b>performed</b> in the stage with Anhui troupes. The combination gradually formed Beijing opera's main melodies.|$|E

Čičak soon commenced a specially tailor made program [...] "Čičak plus Čičak" [...] (“Burdock Plus Burdock") where <b>jointly</b> <b>performed</b> Želimir Altarac Čičak and band Čičak that already gained reputation of best DJ in former Yugoslavia, and where youngster were getting together in Barutana to listen to the latest music production from around the world and particularly progressive and avant-garde genres. It was exactly there, where Čičak made yet another successful step towards, not only working with the music, but rather working on the music of his own. His cooperation with pop-rock group Kodeksi (Codex) resulted in three great hits according to the Sarajevo Radio Chart (the best media platform for progressive music waves of that time). He wrote lyrics for Eduard Bogeljić's song [...] "Lutalica" [...] (Wanderer) but he is also made remake of two great world hits [...] "To Love Somebody" [...] of Bee Gees and [...] "Song of a Baker" [...] of Small Faces.|$|E

30|$|As {{a general}} comment, let us {{note that the}} {{considered}} architectures exhibit substantial differences, and any comparison is therefore necessarily affected by some sort of unfairness.

Nevertheless, we present <b>jointly</b> <b>performed</b> tests for the considered codecs, in order to help evaluating the pro and cons of each architecture in terms of robustness to channel errors.|$|E
