40|$|This essay {{focuses on}} the {{jurisdictional}} problems related to global horizontal cartels, comparing the jurisdictional treatment of antitrust actions for damages brought by vitamins purchasers in U. S. A. and in Europe. While the U. S. Supreme Court has recently narrowed the scope for “foreign-to-foreign” claims in the antitrust field, a prime opportunity of forum shopping seems to be still open in Europe – specially when transnational <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>undertakings</b> are involved – relying on Art. 6. 1 of EC Regulation N. 44 / 2001. An interesting decisions of the U. K. High Court allows a German firm that has purchased goods in Germany from an indirect subsidiary of the parent company fined by the EC Commission to sue that subsidiary in the U. K., relying on the link between this claim and the claim for damages brought – by the same plaintiff – against another subsidiary domiciled in the U. K., notwithstanding {{the absence of any}} purchase from the U. K. defendant. The Author argues that the enforcement of Art. 6. 1 in the situation sketched above could lead to inappropriate multiplication of forums and should therefore not be granted de plano. In order to avoid the risk of abuse of process it is suggested that consolidation of claims should be possible only in the State of the domicile of the main responsible of the infringement or of the firm from which the goods were purchased at inflated prices. The Author then critically addresses the latest developments in the E. C. J. case law on Art. 6. 1, remarking the importance of a scrutiny of the strength of the primary claim, in order to prevent the use of the proviso with the sole object of removing a defendant from his proper forum...|$|R

Since the {{transfer of an undertaking}} from an employer to another could not be achieved with disregard of its human capital, the European legislator has established a legal framework ensuring the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event <b>of</b> transfers <b>of</b> <b>undertakings.</b> Currently, the main legal basis in the field consists of Council Directive 2001 / 23 /EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event <b>of</b> transfers <b>of</b> <b>undertakings,</b> businesses or parts <b>of</b> <b>undertakings</b> or businesses - the Transfer Directive.

The scope of the Transfer Directive, the obligation to inform and consult employees in advance and the transfer of rights and obligations arising from the contract of employment as a result of a merger are being approached.

40|$|This article {{reports on}} the use <b>of</b> {{enforceable}} <b>undertakings</b> by the Australian employment standards enforcement agency, the Office of the Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO), and its predecessor, the Workplace Ombudsman. Enforceable undertakings are used by the FWO as an alternative enforcement tool to court litigation in relation to breaches of the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth), which regulates wages, working hours and other minimum employment conditions. Proponents <b>of</b> enforceable <b>undertakings</b> argue that they deliver value to regulatory agencies as a responsive alternative to traditional, punitive enforcement action. On the other hand, critics have raised concerns about the accountability and effectiveness of this enforcement tool. The authors provide a critical analysis of the FWO&# 039;s use <b>of</b> enforceable <b>undertakings,</b> including consideration <b>of</b> the decision-making process, content, monitoring and enforcement <b>of</b> <b>undertakings.</b> The analysis {{is based on a}} review <b>of</b> all enforceable <b>undertakings</b> concluded in the period from 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2012, as well as qualitative interviews with approximately 60 inspectors, managers and lawyers of the FWO, and a number of specialist workplace relations lawyers. The article reveals that the FWO has made limited but promising use <b>of</b> enforceable <b>undertakings</b> in the review period. Through deployment <b>of</b> enforceable <b>undertakings,</b> the FWO has demonstrated that it has a mix of regulatory approaches available to it that are consistent with the key principles of responsive regulation. The number <b>of</b> enforceable <b>undertakings</b> accepted by the FWO, however, remains fairly limited.
