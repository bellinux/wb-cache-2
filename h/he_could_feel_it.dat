60|$|Immediately {{the cannon}} had been {{discharged}} Captain Hanaford {{was on his}} feet, grasping the tiller {{as if it was}} possible to steer the pungy while the blackness continued so dense that one might fancy <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it,</b> and then came the glare of more rockets.|$|E
6000|$|There was {{something}} in his manner which made her feel at once that the subject to which he alluded was of the greatest importance. Whether weak or strong, of course she must be told now. Let {{the shock of the}} tidings be what it might, the doubt would be worse. She felt all that, and she knew that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it.</b> 'I am quite strong,' she said; 'you must tell me now.' ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{stumbled}} across the landing and plunged into Torpenhow's room. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>it</b> {{was full of}} men. 'Where's the trouble?' said he. 'In the Balkans at last? Why didn't some one tell me?' ...|$|R
60|$|March, to whom {{his wife}} mainly left their obeisance, {{made it so}} {{tentative}} that if it should meet no response <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>it</b> had been {{nothing more than a}} forward stoop, such as was natural in sitting down. He need not really have taken this precaution; those whose eyes he caught more or less nodded in return.|$|R
60|$|Bradley {{sat there}} in the Judge's office in a sort of daze. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not say a word. His thought was not clear. He was not at all anxious. Somehow <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> that <b>it</b> was his fate that was being decided. On the contrary, it seemed to be some other person. He was not excited; he was only puzzled and wondering.|$|R
60|$|The play went on. But he {{was obsessed}} {{by the desire}} to kiss the tiny blue vein that nestled in the bend of her arm. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it.</b> His whole face seemed {{suspended}} till he had put his lips there. It must be done. And the other people! At last he bent quickly forward and touched it with his lips. His moustache brushed the sensitive flesh. Clara shivered, drew away her arm.|$|E
60|$|The captain {{now stood}} {{on the top of}} the mound, with the slab between his feet, and stooping down, he took hold of the handle with both hands. He was a {{powerful}} man, but he could not lift the stone. His first effort, however, loosened it, and then he began to move it from side to side, still pulling upward, until at last <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> rising. Then, with a great heave, he lifted it entirely out of the square aperture in which it had been fitted, and set it on one side.|$|E
60|$|Yet {{that there}} was rivalry by some one he was firmly persuaded. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> in the air around Lucetta, {{see it in the}} turn of her pen. There was an {{antagonistic}} force in exercise, so that when he had tried to hang near her he seemed standing in a refluent current. That it was not innate caprice he was more and more certain. Her windows gleamed as if they did not want him; her curtains seem to hang slily, as if they screened an ousting presence. To discover whose presence that was--whether really Farfrae's after all, or another's--he exerted himself to the utmost to see her again; and at length succeeded.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{he became}} composed. His tremor subsided. He clenched {{his teeth and}} drew down his eyebrows. He had not {{exhausted}} his means of defense; a new design had shaped itself in his mind--another plan of battle. Raising {{the front end of}} the strip of board, he carefully pushed it forward through the wreckage at the side of the rifle until it pressed against the trigger guard. Then he moved the end slowly outward until <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>it</b> had cleared it, then, closing his eyes, thrust it against the trigger with all his strength! There was no explosion; the rifle had been discharged as it dropped from his hand when the building fell. But it did its work.|$|R
60|$|And Augusta, as {{she gazed}} on the noble face, the ardent {{expression}} of sincerity and remorse, could not doubt {{that her husband}} was saved. But Edward's plan of reformation had one grand defect. It was merely modification and retrenchment, and not entire abandonment. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> necessary to cut himself off entirely from the scenes and associations where temptation had met him. He considered not that, when the temperate flow of the blood and the even balance of the nerves have once been destroyed, there is, ever after, a double and fourfold liability, which often makes a man the sport of the first untoward chance.|$|R
60|$|Holden {{found one}} {{helpless}} little hand that closed feebly on his finger. And the clutch ran {{through his body}} till it settled about his heart. Till then his sole thought had been for Ameera. He began to realise {{that there was some}} one else in the world, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> that <b>it</b> was a veritable son with a soul. He sat down to think, and Ameera dozed lightly.|$|R
60|$|He {{tied the}} cord, and slithered hastily to the branch below her; then, bracing {{himself against the}} trunk, he {{clutched}} her round the waist and knees; but the taut cord held her up, {{and she would not}} come to anchor. He could not hold her and untie the cord, which was fast round her waist. If he let her go with one hand, and got out his knife, he {{would never be able to}} cut and hold her at the same time. For a moment he thought he had better climb up again and slack off the cord, but he could see by her face that she was getting frightened; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> by the quivering of her body.|$|E
60|$|That night, at ten o'clock, {{when all}} in the hold had been asleep half an hour, Oswald rose quietly from the rushes, on which he and a dozen of his comrades were sleeping, {{and made his way}} noiselessly out of the room; went into the stables and fetched the piece of iron, which he had, during the day, placed so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> in the dark; took the coil of rope in his hands, and ascended the steps. The top was but some ten feet from the turret. He stood quiet, until he heard the sentry moving away from him, then he mounted the last steps, and in a moment reached the foot of the turret stairs. Roger was {{standing}} there.|$|E
60|$|These gifts {{safely in}} his pocket, {{he began to}} stroll towards the railway station, whence the {{diligence}} started, slowly, as he had plenty of time. As he went he saw, in a shop window, a beautiful stick of olive wood, with an ebony crook. It was marked ten francs, and he coveted it greatly, but reflected with a sigh that having spent so much on others he could afford nothing for himself, for Godfrey was an unselfish soul. Instead he bought a collar of Swiss lace for Mrs. Parsons. Immediately {{after he left the}} lace shop he became aware that he was being shadowed. He heard no footfall, and he saw no one, but he knew that this was so; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> down his back, and in a cold wind which blew across his hands, as it had done always at the Villa Ogilvy s√©ances.|$|E
60|$|This {{was very}} unlike {{the way in}} which his mother used to beseech him as a favour to spare her, and yet his aunt's tone was so affectionate, as well as so authoritative, that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> unkind. She left the room, and as soon as she found herself alone in the passage, leant against the wall and trembled, for she felt herself for a moment quite overwhelmed, and longed earnestly for her husband to think for her, or even for one short {{interval}} in which to reflect. For this, however, there was no time, and with one earnest mental supplication, summoning up her energies, she walked on to the person whom she at that moment most dreaded to see, her sister-in-law. She found her sitting in her arm-chair, Henrietta with her, both looking very anxious, and she was glad to find her prepared.|$|R
60|$|When all was ready, the man {{reached in}} his pocket for a second piece of birch-bark. He knew the bark was there, and, though <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> with his fingers, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> hear its crisp {{rustling}} as he fumbled for it. Try as <b>he</b> would, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not clutch hold of it. And all the time, in his consciousness, was the knowledge that each instant his feet were freezing. This thought tended {{to put him in}} a panic, but he fought against it and kept calm. He pulled on his mittens with his teeth, and threshed his arms back and forth, beating his hands with all his might against his sides. He did this sitting down, and he stood up to do it; and all the while the dog sat in the snow, its wolf-brush of a tail curled around warmly over its forefeet, its sharp wolf-ears pricked forward intently as it watched the man. And the man as he beat and threshed with his arms and hands, felt a great surge of envy as he regarded the creature that was warm and secure in its natural covering.|$|R
5000|$|In 2005, Phillies pitcher Jon Lieber, {{a former}} Pirate, called it [...] "a shame" [...] {{that the two}} teams [...] "don't play more often", and [...] "we'd get back to playing more National League teams." [...] Pirates {{broadcaster}} Bob Walk said that [...] "this is a rivalry that I grew up with...For some of us older Pirates and Phillies fans and faithful and players, the rivalry is kind of still there...I know the history of it...Because I {{was on the other}} side of it, too." [...] Phillies General Manager Ed Wade said that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> [...] "certainly <b>feel</b> <b>it,</b> having been on both ends", having started his career with the Pirates in their public relations department in the late 1970s.|$|R
60|$|He {{was young}} and the pomp of war had its effect on him, but the human element began to take second place. Although {{an officer of the}} new army, he was first of all an engineer; his {{business}} was to handle wood and iron rather than men. The throb of the planks and the swing of the pontoons as the load passed over them fascinated him; and his interest deepened when the transport began to cross. Sweating, spume-flecked horses trod the quivering timber with iron-shod hoofs; grinding wheels jarred the structure as the wagons passed. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> yield and bend, but it stood, and Dick was conscious of a strange, emotional thrill. This, in a sense, was his triumph; the first big task in which he had taken a man's part; and his work had passed the test. Taste, inclination, and interest had suddenly deepened into an absorbing love for his profession.|$|E
6000|$|For {{inevitable}} {{she felt}} it was at last. As each day went by it grew harder and harder for the man to contain himself. Fighting desperately against it every hour, immersing himself {{as much as he}} could in the petty fiddling details of the office and the Victualing Yard so as to keep the fierce impulse under due control, Michael Trevennack yet found the mad mood within him more and more ungovernable with each week that went by. As he put it to his own mind he could feel his wings growing as if they must burst through the skin; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> harder and ever harder as time went on to conceal the truth, to pretend he was a mere man, when he knew himself to be really the Prince of the Archangels, to busy himself about contracts for pork, and cheese, and biscuits, when he could wing his way n boldly over sea and land, or stand forth before the world in gorgeous gear, armed as of yore in the adamant and gold of his celestial panoply! ...|$|E
60|$|The jury retired {{for more}} than an hour. During all that time two men stood there in mortal suspense, intent and haggard, both upon their trial, but not both equally. The {{prisoner}} in the dock fixed his arms in a dogged and sullen attitude, the colour half gone from his brown cheek, and his eyes straining with excitement, but showing no outward sign of any emotion except the craven fear of death. Walter Dene stood almost fainting {{in the body of the}} court, his bloodless fingers still fumbling nervously at the little phial, and his face deadly pale with the awful pallor of a devouring horror. His heart scarcely beat at all, but at each long slow pulsation <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> throb distinctly within his bosom. He saw or heard nothing before him, but kept his aching eyes fixed steadily on the door by which the jury were to enter. Junior counsel nudged one another to notice his agitation, and whispered that that poor young curate had evidently never seen a man tried for his life before.|$|E
60|$|The living was {{hereafter}} for Edmund; and, had {{his uncle}} {{died a few}} years sooner, {{it would have been}} duly given to some friend to hold till he were old enough for orders. But Tom's extravagance had, previous to that event, been so great as to render a different disposal of the next presentation necessary, and the younger brother must help to pay for the pleasures of the elder. There was another family living actually held for Edmund; but though this circumstance had made the arrangement somewhat easier to Sir Thomas's conscience, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not but <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> to be an act of injustice, and he earnestly tried to impress his eldest son with the same conviction, in the hope of its producing a better effect than anything he had yet been able to say or do.|$|R
60|$|Reader, {{it is not}} {{possible}} to give you an adequate conception of the sensations and sufferings of John Jarwin on that first night of his bereaved condition. He dreamed continuously of tobacco. Now he was pacing the deck of his old ship with a splendid pipe of cut Cavendish between his lips. Anon he was smoking a meerschaum the size of a hogshead, with a stem equal to the length and thickness of the main-topmast of a seventy-four; but somehow the meerschaum wouldn't draw, whereupon John, in a passion, pronounced it worthy of its name, and hove it overboard, when it was instantly transformed into a shark with a cutty pipe in its mouth. To console himself our hero endeavoured to thrust into his mouth a quid of negro-head, which, however, suddenly grew as big as the cabin-skylight, and became as tough as gutta-percha, so that it was utterly impossible to bite off a piece; and, stranger still, when the poor sailor had by struggling got it in, it dwindled down into a point so small that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> in his mouth at all. On reaching this, the vanishing-point, Jarwin awoke to a consciousness of the dread reality of his destitute condition. Turning on his other side with a deep groan, he fell asleep again, to dream of tobacco in some new and tantalising form until sunrise, when he awoke unrefreshed. Leaping up, he cast off his clothes, rushed down the beach, and plunged into sea, by way of relieving his feelings.|$|R
6000|$|To see her sad! Twice, {{during the}} {{afternoon}} and evening, he had spoken those words--or was it three times? Was there a time she had forgotten? And each time she had answered: [...] "I'm not sad." [...] What she had felt indeed was not sadness,--but how could she describe it to him when she herself was amazed and dwarfed by <b>it?</b> <b>Could</b> <b>he</b> not <b>feel</b> <b>it,</b> too? Were men so different?... In the cab his solicitation, his tenderness were only to be compared with his bewilderment, his apparent awe of the feeling he himself had raised up in her, and which awed her, likewise. She had actually felt that bewilderment of his when, just before they had reached the station, she had responded passionately to his last embrace. Even as he returned her caresses, it had been conveyed to her amazingly {{by the quality of}} his touch. Was it a lack all women felt in men? and were these, even in supreme moments, merely the perplexed transmitters of life?--not life itself? Her thoughts did not gain this clarity, though she divined the secret. And yet she loved him--loved him with a fierceness that frightened her, with a tenderness that unnerved her....|$|R
60|$|The {{old-timer}} on Sulphur Creek was right, {{he thought}} {{in the moment of}} controlled despair that ensued: after fifty below, a man should travel with a partner. He beat his hands, but failed in exciting any sensation. Suddenly he bared both hands, removing the mittens with his teeth. He caught the whole bunch between the heels of his hands. His arm-muscles not being frozen enabled him to press the hand-heels tightly against the matches. Then he scratched the bunch along his leg. It flared into flame, seventy sulphur matches at once! There was no wind to blow them out. He kept {{his head to one side}} to escape the strangling fumes, and held the blazing bunch to the birch-bark. As he so held it, he became aware of sensation in his hand. His flesh was burning. He could smell it. Deep down below the surface <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it.</b> The sensation developed into pain that grew acute. And still he endured it, holding the flame of the matches clumsily to the bark that would not light readily because his own burning hands were in the way, absorbing most of the flame.|$|E
6000|$|In that uninitiated {{observation}} of the great spectacle of English life upon which I have touched, it might be supposed that Newman passed a great many dull days. But the dullness of his days pleased him; his melancholy, which was settling into a secondary stage, like a healing wound, had in it a certain acrid, palatable sweetness. He had company in his thoughts, and for the present he wanted no other. He {{had no desire to}} make acquaintances, and he left untouched a couple of notes of introduction which had been sent him by Tom Tristram. He thought a great deal of Madame de Cintre--sometimes with a dogged tranquillity which might have seemed, for {{a quarter of an hour}} at a time, a near neighbor to forgetfulness. He lived over again the happiest hours he had known--that silver chain of numbered days in which his afternoon visits, tending sensibly to the ideal result, had subtilized his good humor to a sort of spiritual intoxication. He came back to reality, after such reveries, with a somewhat muffled shock; he had begun to feel the need of accepting the unchangeable. At other times the reality became an infamy again and the unchangeable an imposture, and he gave himself up to his angry restlessness till he was weary. But on the whole he fell into a rather reflective mood. Without in the least intending it or knowing it, he attempted to read the moral of his strange misadventure. He asked himself, in his quieter hours, whether perhaps, after all, he WAS more commercial than was pleasant. We know that it was in obedience to a strong reaction against questions exclusively commercial that he had come out to pick up aesthetic entertainment in Europe; it may therefore be understood that he was able to conceive that a man might be too commercial. He was very willing to grant it, but the concession, as to his own case, was not made with any very oppressive sense of shame. If he had been too commercial, he was ready to forget it, for in being so he had done no man any wrong that might not be as easily forgotten. He reflected with sober placidity that at least there were no monuments of his [...] "meanness" [...] scattered about the world. If there was any reason in the nature of things why his connection with business should have cast a shadow upon a connection--even a connection broken--with a woman justly proud, he was willing to sponge it out of his life forever. The thing seemed a possibility; he could not feel it, doubtless, as keenly as some people, and it hardly seemed worth while to flap his wings very hard to rise to the idea; but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> enough to make any sacrifice that still remained to be made. As to what such sacrifice was now to be made to, here Newman stopped short before a blank wall over which there sometimes played a shadowy imagery. He had a fancy of carrying out his life as he would have directed it if Madame de Cintre had been left to him--of making it a religion to do nothing that she would have disliked. In this, certainly, there was no sacrifice; but there was a pale, oblique ray of inspiration. It would be lonely entertainment--a good deal like a man talking to himself in the mirror for want of better company. Yet the idea yielded Newman several half hours' dumb exaltation as he sat, with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched, over the relics of an expensively poor dinner, in the undying English twilight. If, however, his commercial imagination was dead, he felt no contempt for the surviving actualities begotten by it. He was glad he had been prosperous and had been a great man of business rather than a small one; he was extremely glad he was rich. He felt no impulse to sell all he had and give to the poor, or to retire into meditative economy and asceticism. He was glad he was rich and tolerably young; it was possible to think too much about buying and selling, it was a gain to have a good slice of life left in which not to think about them. Come, what should he think about now? Again and again Newman could think only of one thing; his thoughts always came back to it, and as they did so, with an emotional rush which seemed physically to express itself in a sudden upward choking, he leaned forward--the waiter having left the room--and, resting his arms on the table, buried his troubled face.|$|E

6000|$|... "If you are, act {{accordingly}} and don't mix {{up things}} that are as wide asunder as the poles!" [...] She spoke with sternness and his silence appeared again to represent an admission that her sternness counted for him. Possibly she was touched by it; after a few moments, at any rate, during which nothing more passed between them, she appealed {{to him in a}} gentler and more anxious key, which had this virtue to touch him that he knew it was absolutely {{the first time in her}} life she had really begged for anything. She had never been obliged to beg; she had got on without it and most things had come to her. He might judge therefore in what a light she regarded this boon for which in her bereft old age she humbled herself to be a suitor. There was such a pride in her that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> what <b>it</b> cost her to go on her knees even to her son. He did judge how it was in his power to gratify her; and as he was generous and imaginative he was stirred and shaken as it came over him in a wave of figurative suggestion that he might make up to her for many things. He scarcely needed to hear her ask with a pleading wail that was almost tragic: [...] "Don't you see how things have turned out for us? Don't you know how unhappy I am, don't you know what a bitterness----?" [...] She stopped with a sob in her voice and he recognised vividly this last tribulation, the unhealed wound of her change of life and her lapse from eminence to flatness. [...] "You know what Percival is and the comfort I have of him. You know the property and what he's doing with it and what comfort I get from that! Everything's dreary but what you can do for us. Everything's odious, down to living in a hole with one's girls who don't marry. Grace is impossible--I don't know what's the matter with her; no one will look at her, and she's so conceited with it--sometimes I feel as if I could beat her! And Biddy will never marry, and we're three dismal women in a filthy house, and what are three dismal women, more or less, in London?" ...|$|R
