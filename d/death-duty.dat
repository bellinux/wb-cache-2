6000|$|In Scotland, as elsewhere, {{the causes}} of the {{religious}} revolution were many. The wealth and luxury of the higher clergy, and of the dwellers in the abbeys, had long been the butt of satire and of the fiercer indignation of the people. Benefices, great and small, were jobbed on every side between the popes, the kings, and the great nobles. Ignorant and profligate cadets of the great houses were appointed to high ecclesiastical offices, while the minor clergy were inconceivably ignorant just at the moment when the new critical learning, with knowledge of Hebrew and Greek, was revolutionising the study of the sacred books. The celibacy of the clergy had become a mere farce; and they got dispensations enabling them to obtain ecclesiastical livings for their bastards. The kings set the worst example: both James IV. and James V. secured the richest abbeys, and, in the case of James IV., the Primacy, for their bastard sons. All these abuses were of old standing. [...] "Early in the thirteenth century certain of the abbots of Jedburgh, supported by their chapters, had granted certain of their appropriate churches to priests with a right of succession to their sons" [...] (see 'The Mediaeval Church in Scotland,' by the late Bishop Dowden, chap. xix. Mac- Lehose, 1910.) Oppressive customs by which [...] "the upmost claith," [...] or a pecuniary equivalent, was extorted as a kind of <b>death-duty</b> by the clergy, were sanctioned by excommunication: no grievance was more bitterly felt by the poor. The once-dreaded curses on evil-doers became a popular jest: purgatory was a mere excuse for getting money for masses.|$|E

50|$|Heriot, from Old English heregeat ("war-gear"), was {{originally}} a <b>death-duty</b> in late Anglo-Saxon England, which required that at death, a nobleman provided to his king a given set of military equipment, often including horses, swords, shields, spears and helmets. It later {{developed into a}} kind of tenurial feudal relief due from villeins. The equivalent term in French was droit du meilleur catel.|$|E

5000|$|After his uncle's {{death in}} 1949, with heavy <b>death-duties</b> Seymour was {{compelled}} to buy the house he had expected to inherit and, in a country auction, as many of its contents as he could afford. He borrowed £50,000, (equivalent to £ as of [...] ) [...] and by selling {{the majority of the}} estate, paid it back within the year.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why didn't {{you keep}} Vigil to dinner?" [...] he said. [...] "I {{could have given}} him things for the night. I {{wanted to talk to}} him about {{insuring}} my life; he knows, about that. There'll be a lot of money wanted, to pay my <b>death-duties.</b> And if the Radicals get in I shouldn't be surprised if they put them up fifty per cent." ...|$|R
6000|$|His sole {{idea was}} to hand over (in the old Scottish fashion) {{the main part of}} his {{property}} to Logan, inter vivos, and then to live long enough to evade the <b>death-duties.</b> Merton and Logan knew well enough the unsoundness of any such proceedings, especially considering the mental debility of the old gentleman. However, the papers were made out. The marquis retired to one of his English seats, after which event his reappearance was made known to the world. In his English home Logan sedulously nursed him. A more generous diet than he had ever known before did wonders for the marquis, though he peevishly remonstrated against every bottle of wine that was uncorked. He did live for the span which he deemed necessary for his patriotic purpose, and peacefully expired, his last words being 'Nae grand funeral.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I hired {{this off}} of my Lord Marshalton,' Zigler explained, while they helped {{us out of}} our coats under the severe eyes of ruffed and periwigged ancestors. 'Ya-as. They always look at me too, as if I'd blown in from the gutter. Which, of course, I have. That's Mary, Lady Marshalton. Old man Joshua painted her. Do you see any {{likeness}} to my Lord Marshalton? Why, haven't you ever met up with him? He was Captain Mankeltow--my Royal British Artillery captain that blew up my gun in the war, an' then tried to bury me against my religious principles[4]. Ya-as. His father died and he got the lordship. That was about all he got {{by the time that}} your British <b>death-duties</b> were through with him. So he said I'd oblige him by hiring his ranch. It's a hell an' a half of a proposition to handle, but Tommy--Mrs. Laughton--understands it. Come right in to the parlour and be very welcome.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How do {{you make}} that out, father?" [...] I asked. He had been very rude over {{the matter of the}} <b>death-duties</b> of his own estate, though it is entailed and I must inherit. So I {{determined}} to let him see that I know a good deal more than he does--of law, at any rate. [...] "I fear that when we come to look into it closely that dog won't fight. In the first place, that may be all arranged in the letter to St. Leger, which {{is a part of the}} Will. And if that letter should be inoperative by his refusal of the conditions (whatever they may be), then the letter to the attorney begins to work. What it is we don't know, and perhaps even he doesn't--I looked at it as well as I could--and we law men are trained to observation. But even if the instructions mentioned as being in Letter C fail, then the corpus of the Will gives full power to Trent to act just as he darn pleases. He can give the whole thing to himself if he likes, and no one can say a word. In fact, he is himself the final court of appeal." ...|$|R
50|$|This policy {{produced}} a major scandal in Germany in December 1932 and January 1933, the Osthilfeskandal. A {{considerable number of}} Junkers were found out to have wasted the money on what {{was considered to be}} luxury items, such as cars and vacations. The ensuing investigations into the scandal also implicated the President of the Republic, General Paul von Hindenburg. It came to light that the Hindenburg family's highly indebted estate in East Prussia at Neudeck (owned by the president's brother) had been clandestinely bought in 1927 by a number of industrialists and given to the president as a gift, seemingly in exchange for political influence. The agrarian lobbyists were enraged that the government had not tried to cover up the scandal. Since some of the Reich President's close friends and fellow landowners were implicated, the ire directed at the Chancellor could be transmitted directly through the former. Furthermore, {{in the wake of the}} scandal, it was revealed that Hindenburg's property at Neudeck had been registered in his son's name to avoid <b>death-duties,</b> Schleicher was held responsible by the President for allowing his name to be tarnished. Some historians believe that the scandal was instrumental in weakening Hindenburg's position to the point where he caved in to industrialist pressure to appoint Adolf Hitler as chancellor at the end of January 1933.|$|R
6000|$|And {{now about}} Rupert. As I have said, {{he ran away}} {{when he was about}} fourteen, and we did not hear about him for years. When we--or, rather, my father--did hear of him, it was no good that he heard. He had gone as a cabin-boy on a sailing ship round the Horn. Then he joined an {{exploring}} party through the centre of Patagonia, and then another up in Alaska, and a third to the Aleutian Islands. After that he went through Central America, and then to Western Africa, the Pacific Islands, India, and a lot of places. We all know the wisdom of the adage that [...] "A rolling stone gathers no moss"; and certainly, if there be any value in moss, Cousin Rupert will die a poor man. Indeed, nothing will stand his idiotic, boastful wastefulness. Look at the way in which, when he came of age, he made over all his mother's little fortune to the MacSkelpie! I am sure that, though Uncle Roger made no comment to my father, who, as Head of our House, should, of course, have been informed, he was not pleased. My mother, who has a good fortune in her own right, and has had the sense to keep it in her own control--as I am to inherit it, and it is not in the entail, I am therefore quite impartial--I can approve of her spirited conduct in the matter. We never did think much of Rupert, anyhow; but now, since he is in the way to be a pauper, and therefore a dangerous nuisance, we look on him as quite an outsider. We know what he really is. For my own part, I loathe and despise him. Just now we are irritated with him, for we are all kept on tenterhooks regarding my dear Uncle Roger's Will. For Mr. Trent, the attorney who regulated my dear uncle's affairs and has possession of the Will, says it is necessary to know where every possible beneficiary is to be found before making the Will public, so we all have to wait. It is especially hard on me, who am the natural heir. It is very thoughtless indeed of Rupert to keep away like that. I wrote to old MacSkelpie about it, but he didn't seem to understand or to be at all anxious--he is not the heir! He said that probably Rupert Sent Leger--he, too, keeps to the old spelling--did not know of his uncle's death, or he would have taken steps to relieve our anxiety. Our anxiety, forsooth! We are not anxious; we only wish to know. And if we--and especially me--who have all the annoyance of thinking of the detestable and unfair <b>death-duties,</b> are anxious, we should be so. Well, anyhow, he'll get a properly bitter disappointment and set down when he does turn up and discovers that he is a pauper without hope! ...|$|R
