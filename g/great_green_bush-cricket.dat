50|$|The {{red-footed falcon}} is a {{bird of prey}} with a diet {{consisting}} {{of a variety of}} insects, amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds, such as <b>great</b> <b>green</b> <b>bush-crickets,</b> spadefoot toads, sand lizards, the common vole and bird nestlings, respectively. This bird's distinctive method of hunting is shared by the common kestrel. It regularly hovers, searching the ground below, then makes a short steep dive towards the target. When feeding their nestlings, the youngest nestlings receive the most food more frequently and more regularly. Chicks that are between 0 and 3 weeks old will get fed bigger prey like toads, lizards, bird nestlings, and <b>great</b> <b>green</b> <b>bush-crickets,</b> while nestlings over that age will get fed less frequently and with less variety. Young nestlings's diet consists mostly of Orthoptera and beetles with a some vertebrates, while older nestlings' diet mostly consists of Orthoptera and almost never receives vertebrates.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first step}} towards the <b>Great</b> <b>Green</b> Wall was set with the {{development}} of a Harmonized regional strategy for implementation of the <b>Great</b> <b>Green</b> Wall Initiative of the Sahara and the Sahel that was adopted in September 2012 by the African Ministerial Conference on Environment (AMCEN).

40|$|Insects have {{developed}} different structures {{to adhere to}} surfaces. Most common are smooth and hairy attachment pads, while nubby pads have also been described for representatives of Mantophasmatodea, Phasmida and Plecoptera. Here {{we report on the}} unusual combination of nubby and smooth tarsal attachment structures in the !nara cricket Acanthoproctus diadematus. Their three proximal tarsal pads (euplantulae) have a nubby surface, whereas the most distal euplantula is rather smooth with a hexagonal ground pattern resembling that described for the <b>great</b> <b>green</b> <b>bush-cricket</b> Tettigonia viridissima. This is, to our knowledge, the first report on nubby euplantulae in Orthoptera and the co-occurrence of nubby and smooth euplantulae on a single tarsus in a polyneopteran species. When adhering upside down to a horizontal glass plate, A. diadematus attaches its nubby euplantulae less often, compared to situations in which the animal is hanging upright or head down on a vertical plate. We discuss possible reasons for this kind of clinging behaviour, such as morphological constrains, the different role of normal and shear forces in attachment enhancement of the nubby and smooth pads, ease of the detachment process, and adaptations to walking on cylindrical substrates...|$|E

5000|$|More {{than six}} {{years after it was}} first announced, the <b>Great</b> <b>Green</b> Fleet made its maiden voyage on late January 20, 2016. Overall, the 2016 <b>Great</b> <b>Green</b> Fleet {{initiative}} was a year-long event.

40|$|The <b>Great</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Bush-cricket,</b> Tettigonia viridissima, is a Devon Biodiversity Action Plan species {{due to a}} {{significant}} reduction in population and range over the last 50 years and UK populations represent the geographical periphery of this species. Previous investigations have found morphological differences between UK and mainland European populations, raising the possibility that UK populations might represent a distinct species or sub-species and thus deserve special conservation status. However, these were based on small sample sizes. In this study samples of T. viridissima from UK, France and Spain were compared using morphological measurements, DNA barcoding and analysis of the male calling song. Morphometric measurements were analysed using a Primary Component Analysis and further investigated using Analysis of Variance. To characterise genetic divergence between populations a 300 bp portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene was used to investigate genetic structure. Male stridulation was recorded using a Batbox Duet frequency division bat detector and analysed using Batsound. Results suggest morphological differences between the UK samples and continental Europe with the UK samples showing smaller wing area and a larger body length than that of Central and Northern France. Morphological differences between French and Spanish populations followed a size cline related to latitude with more southerly populations showing larger features. Analysis of male calling song showed a difference in minimum stridulation frequency with increases following southerly latitude which correlates with wing length results. No differences consistent with geographical distributions were found in COI sequence alignments. Morphological differences could be due to developmental differences linked to differing temperature clines or a non adaptive difference caused by the colonisation history of the species. Consequences of morphometric variation and impacts on flight function and stridulation in bush-crickets are discussed. Faculty of Scienc...|$|E
