5|$|In {{addition}} to the floods, strong winds blew away many roofs and some entire houses made of mud, leaving thousands of people homeless. The combined effects of the preceding <b>floods</b> <b>and</b> Eline left about 463,000people displaced or homeless, including 46,000children five years old or younger. Overall, the preceding <b>floods</b> <b>and</b> Eline caused about 700deaths, half of whom in Chokwe. with damage estimated at $500million (2000USD). At least 17people died directly due to Eline, although many bodies were washed away and unable to be counted.

40|$|Summary Coastal {{wetlands}} of {{the southeastern}} United States are threatened by increases in <b>flooding</b> <b>and</b> salinity {{as a result of}} both natural processes and man-induced hydrologic alterations. Furthermore, global climate change scenarios sug-gest that, as a consequence of rising sea levels, much larger areas of coastal wetlands may be affected by <b>flooding</b> <b>and</b> salinity in the next 50 to 100 years. In this paper, we review studies designed to improve our ability to predict and amelio-rate the impacts of increased <b>flooding</b> <b>and</b> salinity stress on baldcypress (Taxodium distichum (L.) Rich.), which is a domi-nant species of many coastal forested wetlands. Specifically, we review studies on species-level responses to <b>flooding</b> <b>and</b> salinity stress, alone and in combination, we summarize two studies on intraspecific variation in response to <b>flooding</b> <b>and</b> salinity stress, we analyze the physiological mechanisms thought to be responsible for the interaction between <b>flooding</b> <b>and</b> salinity stress, and we discuss the implications for coastal wetland loss and the prospects for developing salt-tolerant lines of baldcypress...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Debris flows form {{deposits}} {{when they}} reach an alluvial fan until they eventually stop. However, houses located in the alluvial fan might affect the debris flow <b>flooding</b> <b>and</b> deposition processes. Few previous studies have considered the effects of houses on debris flow <b>flooding</b> <b>and</b> deposition. This study conducted model experiments and numerical simulations using the Kanako 2 D debris flow simulator to {{determine the influence of}} houses on debris flow <b>flooding</b> <b>and</b> deposition. The model experiments showed that when houses are present, the debris flow spreads widely in the cross direction immediately upstream of the houses, especially when the flow discharge is large or the grain size is small. Houses located in the alluvial fan also influence the deposition area. The presence of houses led to <b>flooding</b> <b>and</b> deposition damage in some places and reduced the damage in others. The simulation also demonstrated the influence of houses. Both the model experiment and the simulation showed that houses change the <b>flooding</b> <b>and</b> deposition areas...|$|R
