30|$|Most of the {{problems}} regarding symmetric/asymmetric approaches can be remedied using double encryption. The advantages of the symmetric approaches are utilized to encrypt bulk of the data, while asymmetric approaches are used to provide authentication/verification to secure communication (as discussed in Sections 3.1. 1 and 3.1. 2 symmetric approaches are sometimes fail in authentication purposes). Using double encryption, a message (may be bulk data) can be <b>encrypted</b> <b>by</b> symmetric key approach, while the key is again <b>encrypted</b> <b>by</b> public/private keys of asymmetric approach. Once the message is <b>encrypted</b> <b>by</b> public key of recipients, {{it can only be}} decrypted by its private key. This ensures a safe communication between the source and the verified/authenticated recipient. On the other hand, if the message is <b>encrypted</b> <b>by</b> private key of the recipient, it can only be decrypted by corresponding public key (which is publicly available). This process authenticates the source of encryption and therefore prevents any possible repudiation or denial from the message generator.|$|R
