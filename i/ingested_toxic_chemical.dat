40|$|Secondary hazards are an {{important}} consideration when dealing with both self-poisoned and chemically contaminated patients. Secondary exposure of hospital staff following the admission of a poisoned patient is relatively rare but potentially serious. Risks usually arise from chemical conversion of a deliberately <b>ingested</b> <b>toxic</b> substance and subsequent offgassing, {{but there may be}} toxic substances on the victim or their clothing. Surface contamination is a more common concern in cases where patients have been exposed to chemical releases. This paper presents a narrative review that considers some of the more commonly encountered <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals</b> and situations that may present secondary hazards in hospitals. Risks to staff can be lowered by reducing the potential for, and duration of, exposure wherever possible. Good communication with the first responders at the scene, consultation with experts, decontamination and use of personal protective equipment, together with regular training, can minimize risks in the hospital environment.

Implementing sustainable material selection strategies on <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals</b> can substantially improve the sustainability of products in both design and manufacturing processes. In this paper, a schematic method is presented for characterizing and benchmarking the human health impact of <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals,</b> as a visual aid to facilitate decision-making in the material selection process for sustainable design and manufacturing. In this schematic method, the human health impact of a <b>toxic</b> <b>chemical</b> is characterized by two critical parameters: daily exposure risk R and environmental persistence T. The human health impact of a <b>toxic</b> <b>chemical</b> is represented by {{its position in the}} Râˆ’T two-dimensional plot, which enables the screening and benchmarking of <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals</b> to be easily made through comparing their relative positions in the characterization plot.

Such secondary metabolites, when <b>ingested,</b> can produce <b>toxic</b> syndromes in humans. As {{it has been}} suggested that mycotoxins might be involved in the development of Kashin-Beck disease (KBD), we undertook a survey of barley grains of KBD-affected families and non-affected families in that country. We found, by thin layer chromatography, a hitherto unknown metabolite of Alternaria sp. This was especially common on the barley grains of KBD-affected families.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} <b>toxic</b> <b>chemical</b> substance {{management in}} three U. S. manufacturing sectors from 1991 to 2008. Decomposition analysis applying the logarithmic mean Divisia index {{is used to}} analyze changes in <b>toxic</b> <b>chemical</b> substance emissions by the following five factors: cleaner production, end-of-pipe treatment, transfer for further management, mixing of intermediate materials, and production scale. Based on our results, the chemical manufacturing sector reduced <b>toxic</b> <b>chemical</b> substance emissions mainly via end-of-pipe treatment. In the meantime, transfer for further management contributed to the reduction of <b>toxic</b> <b>chemical</b> substance emissions in the fabricated metal industry. This occurred because the environmental business market expanded in the 1990 s, and the infrastructure for the recycling of metal and other wastes became more efficient. Cleaner production is the main contributor to <b>toxic</b> <b>chemical</b> reduction in the electrical product industry. This implies that the electrical product industry is successful in developing a more environmentally friendly product design and production process. ...|$|R

40|$|Methodology for {{application}} of a Geographical Information System (GIS) to the distribution of selected <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals</b> in Lake Erie of the Great Lakes is proposed and described in detail in this paper. Seventeen different organic compounds were selected as <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals.</b> An integrated analysis was conducted utilizing a GIS system [...] SPANS. Concentration distributions for individual organic compounds were mapped in GIS by applying the spatial interpolation of point data. An overlay map of fourteen selected <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals</b> was produced in GIS displaying an overall concentration pattern. On this overlay map different levels of <b>toxic</b> <b>chemical</b> concentrations in Lake Erie were clearly identified taking into consideration the fourteen chemicals. The {{results indicated that the}} distributions of the selected <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals</b> displayed higher concentration primarily in the West Basin, near the Detroit River, of the lake. Polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) and Dieldrin which come from the sediments are the predominant organic pollutants in Lake Erie. The area analysis in GIS showed that 95. 60 % of the total water in Lake Erie displayed moderate and low concentration of the selected <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals.</b> This study shows that the proposed methodology for {{application of}} GIS is suitable for mapping the distribution of organic pollutants and for managing water quality in a large water body such as Lake Erie...|$|R
