5|$|Smallpeice, {{once the}} new Cunard board had been constituted, turned his {{attention}} to the new cruise ship being built for the company. The ship, codenamed Q4, had been proposed and planned under the auspices of his predecessor, John Brocklebank. However, with the ship now approaching completion and requiring fitting out, it would fall to Smallpeice and his board to appoint interior and exterior designers and approve design schemes for the new ship. Smallpeice, having assessed a report by the Economist Intelligence Unit, decided on significant alterations to the <b>interior</b> <b>layout,</b> abolishing the old three class layout and replacing it with a flexible layout which could be split into two classes for North Atlantic crossings and combined into a single class layout for cruising in the Caribbean. This new layout was expected to suit the tastes of American passengers, predicted to be the largest passenger group on the new liner.|$|E
25|$|The <b>interior</b> <b>layout</b> of the {{fuselage}} {{suffered from the}} same obstruction {{as some of the}} earlier Lockheeds. The main spar and its related hump virtually separated the cockpit from the main cabin. This required two different entry doors, both requiring over-wing access.|$|E

In April 1815, the quarry of Lameiras was appointed to extract rock for the columns of the main floor.|$|E
25|$|The French Line {{commissioned}} {{artists to}} create posters and publicity for the liner. One {{of the most}} famous posters was by Adolphe Mouron Cassandre, who was also a Russian emigrant to France. Another poster by Albert Sébille, showed the <b>interior</b> <b>layout</b> in a cutaway diagram 15 feet long. This poster is displayed in the Musée national de la Marine in Paris.|$|E

The other is the Théâtre de la Ville (previously the Sarah Bernhardt). Their external architecture is essentially Palladian entrances under arcades, although their <b>interior</b> <b>layouts</b> differ considerably. At the centre of the plaza is a sphinx-endowed fountain, erected in 1808, which commemorates Napoleon's victory in Egypt.|$|R

The west wing on the river side stands on high stone-pedestal foundations.Rother's Mills have been listed on Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Monuments Heritage List, (N°601219, reg.A/773/1-9, June 9, 1992).|$|R
25|$|Known also as the Ceramic Brick House. Originally {{built in}} 1887 as a Second Empire-style mansion {{complete}} with mansard roof, in 1950 {{the windows and}} roof were converted to a more standard gable with dormers. It was also refaced in polychrome glazed brick imported from Leeds. This drastic exterior redesign did not cost the house its historic status as its original framing and <b>interior</b> <b>layout</b> remain intact.|$|E
25|$|From November 1993 onwards, {{starting}} with tram number 45, all Nr I units were modernised by HKL into Nr I+ class. The modernisation included updates to the technics of the trams, {{changes to the}} <b>interior</b> <b>layout,</b> addition of electronic displays displaying {{the name of the}} next stop, as well as replacement of the original seats with new ones. The last tram to be modernised was number 53, modernised in July 2004.|$|E
25|$|The fine Georgian {{dwelling}} {{house was built}} in 1782-4 and cost £45.12.7, not an inconsiderable sum for the time, paying for a Laird's home of almost miniature classical country house appearance. An extension to the house was built in 1906 allowing for remodelling of the <b>interior</b> <b>layout.</b> Electricity was installed in the 1950s, replacing the use of oil lamps and candles.

War duty and age meant that all wiring, plumbing, and <b>interior</b> <b>layouts</b> were stripped and redesigned while her hull was strengthened and her engines converted from coal to oil while being refurbished; virtually a new ship emerged.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} <b>interior</b> <b>layouts</b> were produced at the factory, with an even greater variety produced by home builders of the 400 kit boats sold. A typical layout will feature a galley and sizeable navigation station with a quarter berth aft, with two sofas or a sofa and dinette, a head and hanging locker, and a V-berth forwards. A common layout had pilot berths behind the settees. The quality of finish in the kit boats varies enormously, with some being well above factory standards.|$|R

25|$|Bergfrieds {{averaged}} 20 to 30 metres in height, {{although those}} at Forchtenstein Castle in Burgenland, Austria, and Freistadt Castle reach {{a height of}} 50 metres. Compared with the donjon, which occupies a relatively large ground area because of its elaborate <b>interior</b> <b>layout</b> with living rooms, a hall, kitchen, etc., the bergfried usually has a much smaller footprint, which, although of similar height to the donjon gives it the slimmer appearance of a tower. As a building, the bergfried has an even stronger vertical emphasis than the donjon.|$|E
25|$|The MD-90 is a mid-size, medium-range {{airliner}} {{that was}} developed from the MD-80 series. It is a , updated version of the MD-88 with similar electronic flight instrument system (EFIS) and more powerful, quieter and fuel efficient IAE V2500 engines instead of the JT8D engines, which power the MD-80 series. This made the MD-90 the first derivative variant of the DC-9 to use a high-bypass turbofan engine. Typical seating for the MD-90 ranges from 153 to 172 passengers, depending on the cabin configuration and <b>interior</b> <b>layout.</b>|$|E
25|$|Brugg’s {{reformed}} {{church is}} {{the seat of}} the regional church district. The oldest remaining section, a tower integrated into the town’s former defenses, was completed around 1220. Between 1479 and 1518, the building was expanded in four stages in late-gothic style with three naves, a side chapel, and a choir. The <b>interior</b> <b>layout</b> originates from 1641 to 1642. Its modern exterior design was shaped between 1734 and 1740, when it was completely remodeled in baroque style. New windows emblazoned with the crests of the older family houses of Brugg were installed in 1896.|$|E

In 1879, the ensemble was purchased by the municipality and became the seat of the city hall. To fit its need, municipal authorities ordered a reconstruction in 1878, supervised by building counselor Wilhelm Lincke, and helped by chief mason Albert Rose and chief carpenter Heinrich Mautz (who designed in 1845 Buchholz's tannery). Works remodeled the facade and adapted <b>interiors</b> <b>layout</b> to the needs of office activities. The opening ceremony took place on December 19, 1879.|$|R
40|$|Impulse buying is an {{important}} phenomenon in consumer behavior and retailing. The condition of the consumptive behavior of people in Manado {{might be related to}} the impulsive buying behavior. Store atmosphere are usually aimed at digging deeper into the consumers purses at the point of purchase through encouraging impulsive or unplanned purchases. The purpose of this research is to analyze the influence of store atmosphere (exterior, general <b>interior,</b> store <b>layout,</b> <b>interior</b> display and human variable) on impulsive buying behavior both partially and simultaneously.

25|$|In {{the early}} 80s {{the city of}} Gothenburg, the forerunner in {{creation}} of modern light rail systems in Europe, wished to purchase Nr I -based trams from Valmet for its own tram network. However, due to pressure from the Swedish government, Göteborgs spårvägar were forced {{to place an order}} with the Swedish ASEA instead. In Helsinki a further developed version of the Nr I, the Nr II class, was delivered by Valmet for HKL between 1983 and 1987. The Nr II class trams have an identical external appearance and very similar <b>interior</b> <b>layout</b> to the Nr I class.|$|E
25|$|In the {{original}} <b>interior</b> <b>layout</b> {{with a separate}} conductor and driver the HM V trams had capacity of 29 seated passengers and 69 standing passengers. During the rush hour this could be exceeded by an additional 50 standing passengers. On conversion to one-person operation during the late 1970s and early 80s, the conductor's seat was replaced with two additional seats, bringing the seating capacity up to 31, while the standing capacity was downsized to 57 plus an additional 44 during the rush hour. Following conversion into the Spårakoff, tram number 175 (ex-15) has a capacity of 24 all-seated passengers.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{studies of}} the {{building}} were made {{over the next several}} years. In 2005, a real estate consultant reported that the FBI's scattered workforce (then housed in the Hoover building and 16 other leased sites throughout the D.C. metropolitan area) and the Hoover building's inefficient <b>interior</b> <b>layout</b> were creating workforce inefficiencies for the FBI. Security upgrades, building systems replacements, and other renovations were suggested. At this time, GSA estimated that it would take three years to develop a replacement headquarters and identify a site, and another three years for design, construction, and move-in. The FBI began studying the costs and logistics of moving its headquarters later that year.|$|E

However, the accessibility of a low-floor vehicle can also be utilised from slightly raising portions of kerb at bus stops, or through use of level boarding bus rapid transit 'stations' or tram stops. The combination of access from a kerb was the technological development of the 1990s, as step-free <b>interior</b> <b>layouts</b> for buses had existed in some cases for decades, with entrance steps being introduced as chassis designs and overall height regulations changed.|$|R

25|$|After {{spending}} {{over a year}} laid up, {{first in}} Southampton and then at River Fal, Southern Cross was sold to Greece-based Ulysses Lines in January 1973. Renamed SS Calypso, the ship sailed to Piraeus where she was converted into a dedicated cruise ship. The original <b>interior</b> <b>layout</b> was retained {{with the exception of}} the indoor pool, which was replaced by a disco, whilst all interior furnishings were replaced with fashionable minimalist chrome-and-plastic creations, to conform with the then newest SOLAS regulations. Additionally, the cabins were refitted so that all now featured private bathrooms. This meant a slight reduction of passenger capacity, from the original 1,160 to 1,000.|$|E
25|$|The Ilmatars {{original}} <b>interior</b> <b>layout</b> was {{a compromise}} between the traditional two-class passenger liner and the new ro-ro car/passenger ferry. In order to transport cars she was fitted with a gate on the port side, from where cars were driven inside the ship and then lifted mechanically to the actual car deck. This arrangement was already out of date when the ship was delivered, as Finland SS Co.'s subsidiary Siljavarustamo had taken the delivery of the first ro-ro ferry with bow and rear gates on the North Baltic already in 1961. An extra cardeck was added on the ship coinciding with the 1973 lengthening, but that too was served by the side gate and a lift.|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{location}} amongst the earthworks of the fort, the barracks {{has become a}} centrepiece of Fort Malden. The building was designed based on the simple, standardized military bungalow layout of the 1800s. This prominent building stands out amongst {{the rest of the}} fort structures due to its long, rectangular shape, as well as its distinctive red brick exterior. Large bay windows along the entranceway compliment the front porch and wooden doors. As this building was part of the restoration process that took place over the late twentieth century, its <b>interior</b> <b>layout</b> has been altered with refinished hardwood floors and additions to all three sections of the core of the building. The restoration also included the reconstruction of chimneys, doors, and windows.|$|E

War duty and age meant that all wiring, plumbing, and <b>interior</b> <b>layouts</b> were stripped and redesigned while her hull was strengthened and her boilers converted from coal to oil while being refurbished.

2500|$|The building's {{structure}} and materials were modern, rational, and [...] "honest", consistent with Langer's principles. The structure comprised {{a grid of}} concrete columns supporting concrete floor slabs, freeing the floor plan from loadbearing partitions, which maximised the flexibility of <b>interior</b> <b>layouts.</b> The vertical circulation, toilets and shower rooms, tea rooms, and other shared facilities were grouped in a central core. In this way, the floor plan was sensible and efficient and was repeated up the building. Principal materials were self-finishing, expressing their inherent character and beauty, with a noticeable use of Queensland-sourced materials for a [...] "natural", decorative effect. Where practical, Langer eliminated suspended ceilings from the design.|$|R
