5|$|The puffins are {{energetic}} burrow-engineers and repairers and {{the grassy}} slopes may be undermined by {{a network of}} tunnels. This causes the turf to dry out in summer, vegetation to die and dry soil be whirled away by the wind. Burrows sometimes collapse, and humans may cause this to happen by walking incautiously across nesting slopes. A colony on Grassholm was lost through erosion when there was so little soil left that burrows could not be made. New colonies are very unlikely to start up spontaneously because this <b>gregarious</b> <b>bird</b> will only nest where others are already present. Nevertheless, the Audubon Society had success on Eastern Egg Rock Island in Maine, where, after a gap of ninety years, puffins were reintroduced and started breeding again. By 2011 there were over 120 pairs nesting on the small islet. On the Isle of May {{on the other side}} of the Atlantic, only five pairs of puffins were breeding in 1958 while twenty years later there were 10,000 pairs.|$|E
5|$|The quail is a {{small to}} medium-sized, cryptically {{coloured}} bird. In its natural environment, it is found in bushy places, in rough grassland, among agricultural crops, and in other places with dense cover. It feeds on seeds, insects, and other small invertebrates. Being a largely ground-dwelling, <b>gregarious</b> <b>bird,</b> domestication of the quail was not difficult, although many of its wild instincts are retained in captivity. It was known to the Egyptians long {{before the arrival of}} chickens and was depicted in hieroglyphs from 2575 BC. It migrated across Egypt in vast flocks and the birds could sometimes be picked up off the ground by hand. These were the common quail (Coturnix coturnix), but modern domesticated flocks are mostly of Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) which was probably domesticated as early as the 11th century AD in Japan. They were originally kept as songbirds, and they are thought to have been regularly used in song contests.|$|E
6000|$|The {{night was}} misty, {{and though the}} {{temperature}} was 35 degrees, I was miserably cold; for my blankets being laid on the bare ground, the chill seemed to strike from the rock to the very marrow of my bones. In the morning the fog hung till sunrise, when it rose majestically from all the mountain-tops; but the view obtained was transient, for {{in less than an}} hour the dense woolly banks of fog which choked the valleys ascended like a curtain to the warmed atmosphere above, and slowly threw a veil over the landscape. I waited till the last streak of snow was shut out from my view, when I descended, to breakfast on Himalayan grouse (Tetrao-perdix nivicola), a small <b>gregarious</b> <b>bird</b> which inhabits the loftiest stony mountains, and utters a short cry of [...] "Quiok, quiok;" [...] in character and appearance it is intermediate between grouse and partridge, and is good eating, though tough.|$|E
50|$|Caribbean martins are <b>gregarious</b> <b>birds</b> which {{hunt for}} insects in flight. Their call is a gurgly chew-chew.|$|R
50|$|These <b>gregarious</b> <b>birds</b> eat large {{insects and}} fruit. They are very vocal, {{producing}} {{a wide range}} of songs and calls, sometimes including mimicry.|$|R
50|$|Both {{species have}} short yellow or {{yellowish}} legs and a medium bill. These are not <b>gregarious</b> <b>birds</b> and are seldom seen in large flocks.|$|R
60|$|With {{respect to}} their propagation, I {{was told by the}} country people in Chile that the condor makes no sort of nest, but in the months of November and December lays two large white eggs on a shelf of bare rock. It is said that the young condors cannot fly for an entire year; and long after they are able, they {{continue}} to roost by night, an hunt by day with their parents. The old birds generally live in pairs; but among the inland basaltic cliffs of the Santa Cruz I found a spot where scores must usually haunt. On coming suddenly to the brow of the precipice, it was a grand spectacle to see between twenty and thirty of these great birds start heavily from their resting-place, and wheel away in majestic circles. From the quantity of dung on the rocks, they must long have frequented this cliff for roosting and breeding. Having gorged themselves with carrion on the plains below, they retire to these favourite ledges to digest their food. From these facts, the condor, like the gallinazo must to a certain degree be considered as a <b>gregarious</b> <b>bird.</b> In {{this part of the country}} they live altogether on the guanacos which have died a natural death, or as more commonly happens, have been killed by the pumas. I believe, from what I saw in Patagonia, that they do not on ordinary occasions extend their daily excursions to any great distance from their regular sleeping-places.|$|E
60|$|If the Dodo {{were only}} a <b>gregarious</b> <b>bird</b> - if he had only some {{confused}} idea of making a comfortable nest - I could hope {{to get through the}} hours between this and bed-time, without being consumed by devouring melancholy. But, the Dodo's habits are all wrong. It provides me with a trackless desert of sitting-room, with a chair for every day in the year, a table for every month, and a waste of sideboard where a lonely China vase pines in a corner for its mate long departed, and will never make a match with the candlestick in the opposite corner if it live till Doomsday. The Dodo has nothing in the larder. Even now, I behold the Boots returning with my sole in a piece of paper; and with that portion of my dinner, the Boots, perceiving me at the blank bow window, slaps his leg as he comes across the road, pretending it is something else. The Dodo excludes the outer air. When I mount up to my bedroom, a smell of closeness and flue gets lazily up my nose like sleepy snuff. The loose little bits of carpet writhe under my tread, and take wormy shapes. I don't know the ridiculous man in the looking-glass, beyond having met him once or twice in a dish-cover - and I can never shave HIM to-morrow morning! The Dodo is narrow-minded as to towels; expects me to wash on a freemason's apron without the trimming: when I asked for soap, gives me a stony-hearted something white, with no more lather in it than the Elgin marbles. The Dodo has seen better days, and possesses interminable stables at the back - silent, grass-grown, broken-windowed, horseless.|$|E
50|$|This {{conspicuous}} and <b>gregarious</b> <b>bird</b> advertises {{its presence}} with its whistling pii-pii-pii-pii- call.|$|E

50|$|They {{are smaller}} than most woodhoopoes and their bills are {{strongly}} curved like a scimitar, giving them their name. They are mostly glossy black in colour with a few white markings on the wings. While other woodhoopoes are <b>gregarious</b> <b>birds</b> which gather in flocks, the scimitarbills are usually seen alone or in pairs.|$|R
5000|$|Quelea [...] is a genus {{of small}} {{passerine}} birds {{that belongs to}} the weaver family Ploceidae, confined to Africa. These are small-sized, sparrow- or finch-like <b>gregarious</b> <b>birds,</b> with bills adapted to eating seeds. Queleas may be nomadic over vast ranges; the red-billed quelea {{is said to be}} the most numerous bird species in the world.|$|R
50|$|It {{is a rare}} vagrant {{north of}} its {{breeding}} range. There is just a single record from Great Britain, at Cley, Norfolk on 14 June 1981. This <b>gregarious</b> <b>bird</b> {{is also found in}} human settlements in suitable country.|$|E
50|$|It is a <b>gregarious</b> <b>bird</b> and {{is found}} in small, active parties that are always on the move as they forage among the foliage or on the ground. They chatter noisily to one another as they move through their territory.|$|E
50|$|Eared doves feed {{mainly on}} seed {{taken from the}} ground, but will take other items such as soaked bread. They can be {{agricultural}} pests. This is a <b>gregarious</b> <b>bird</b> when not feeding, and forms flocks especially at migration time or at communal roosts.|$|E
60|$|The crows {{give him}} up reluctantly. They circle {{for a few}} minutes over the grove, rising and falling with that beautiful, regular motion that seems like the {{practice}} drill of all <b>gregarious</b> <b>birds,</b> and generally end by collecting in some tree at a distance and hawing about it for hours, till some new excitement calls them elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|Social and <b>gregarious,</b> these <b>birds</b> {{travel in}} noisy flocks {{of up to}} ten {{individuals}} when possible.|$|R
5|$|Emus are diurnal {{birds and}} spend their day foraging, {{preening}} their plumage with their beak, dust bathing and resting. They are generally <b>gregarious</b> <b>birds</b> {{apart from the}} breeding season, and while some forage, others remain vigilant to their mutual benefit. They are able to swim when necessary, although they rarely do so unless the area is flooded or they need to cross a river.|$|R
