5|$|Mulder {{performs}} {{further research}} on the adoption records and uncovers information on a third sister (Perkins), who is apparently troubled and homeless. With Starkey's help, Mulder canvases abandoned buildings in a desolate part of town. However, the Dark Figure finds and kills the girl. After finding Father Gregory at the scene, Mulder believes that {{he is responsible for}} the murders. Under questioning by Mulder and Scully, Father Gregory insists that he tried to protect the girls' souls from the Devil, and that the fourth girl must be located. While the agents step out of the interrogation room, Starkey enters and demands to know the location of the fourth girl. When Gregory <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>answer,</b> he is burned alive by Starkey, who is revealed to be the Devil.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{referendum}} with a counter-proposal, voters {{had the option}} of <b>not</b> <b>answering.</b> A total of 35,657 voters (1.8%) <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>answer</b> the solar energy question, whilst 58,798 (2.9%) <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>answer</b> the counter-proposal.|$|R

5|$|The dating of {{the monuments}} to the Late Preclassic {{indicate}} that the potbelly style may be a later derivative of earlier Olmec colossal heads, although it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>answer</b> {{the question of the}} ethnicity of the sculptors. Potbelly monuments were sometimes reused by later peoples in the region, such as at Sin Cabezas, Copán and Teopán. Arguing against the theory of potbelly sculpture being an Olmec influenced art form is that the direction of diffusion of the style appears to have been from south to north, while the Olmec heartland lies to the north, on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, which would indicate an expected diffusion from north to south if the Olmecs were indeed the origin of the style.|$|E
5|$|Susan meets Jim Dolan at the {{hospital}} and she asks him to talk about the Patient Advocacy Program for a news article. Jim reveals that he has cancer and Susan supports him during his treatments. Malcolm comes to visit his parents and detects all is not well between them. Susan becomes worried when Jim <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>answer</b> her calls and Karl confesses that he asked Jim to keep his distance, which angers Susan. She accuses Karl of being jealous. Karl invites Jim over for lunch and he notices the map and leaflets for Peru. Jim works out Susan is delaying the holiday for him. He then collapses and Susan begs Karl to save him. Susan comforts Jim when he realises he is going to die and she tries to take him out of {{the hospital}}, so they can visit his childhood home, as promised. Karl stops her and when they step outside to talk, Jim dies. Susan is devastated and blames Karl for keeping her from Jim. She then leaves to arrange Jim's funeral. On her return, Susan and Karl announce that they are separating. Malcolm initially blames Susan for the split, but Karl confesses it was his idea. Karl tells Susan that he cannot be just friends with her and he looks for somewhere else to live. Susan starts a book group with Kate and Sonya Mitchell (Eve Morey).|$|E

25|$|Critics {{also argued}} that Rind et al.'s {{statistical}} approach for controlling for family environment {{as a cause of}} maladjustment was conceptually and methodologically invalid. Spiegel stated that inferring the source of maladjustment from analyzing the shared variance between CSA and family environment <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>answer</b> the question of which variable explains maladjustment better; the authors answered that this statement shows a misunderstanding of the statistical procedure used their meta-analysis. Dallam, however, addressed the topic of several prior studies having found statistically significant relations between CSA and maladjustment even after controlling for family environment.|$|E

While making his speech, Amy gets {{a call from}} her boss Dianna, who threatens to fire her if she <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>answer.</b> She chooses to take the call and leaves during his speech. Afterwards, Aaron is upset and they start arguing. They return to her apartment, but Aaron thinks they should not go to bed angry, so Amy rants all night. The next day Aaron tells Amy {{that they need to}} take a break. Hurt, Amy reacts by telling him that it is fine.|$|E
25|$|He was {{referring}} to the ship Polaris's return voyage southward down the Kennedy channel. This <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>answer</b> when it was named. However, the ship's doctor and leader of the scientific part of the expedition, Emil Bessels, wrote of it in his own book, Die amerikanische Nordpol-Expedition (1879). On page 124 he tells that on August 29, 1871, on the voyage north through Kennedy Channel, the Polaris sailed between Grinnell-land (Ellesmere Island) and a small unknown island which they later named Hans Island, after his native Greenlandic helper, Hans Hendrik.|$|E

25|$|The foreign {{invasion}} theory <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>answer</b> {{the question}} of where the inhabitants went. David Webster believed that the population should have increased {{because of the lack of}} elite power. Further, it is not understood why the governmental institutions were not remade following the revolts, which happened under similar circumstances in places like China. A study by anthropologist Elliot M. Abrams came to the conclusion that buildings, specifically in Copan, did not require an extensive amount of time and workers to construct. However, this theory was developed during a period when the archaeological evidence showed that there were fewer Maya people than there are now known to have been. Revolutions, peasant revolts, and social turmoil change circumstances, and are often followed by foreign wars, but they run their course. There are no documented revolutions that caused wholesale abandonment of entire regions.|$|E
25|$|Carrie {{asks her}} {{contacts}} {{for information on}} an underground doctor {{in the area where}} Quinn went missing. Following a tip from former Hezbollah commander Al-Amin (George Georgiou), she tracks down one of the cell's supporters, Dr. Hussein (Mehdi Nebbou). Under threat of arrest, he brings her to an apartment belonging to Qasim (Alireza Bayram), one of the terrorists. In the apartment, Carrie finds extensive research on the Hauptbahnhof train station and heads there to investigate. She finds Qasim in the subway, and pleads with him to stop the plan to bomb the station. Qasim tries to reason with his cousin Bibi (René Ifrah), the ringleader, but Bibi kills him. Carrie then shoots and kills Bibi, neutralizing the threat. Back home, Jonas breaks up with Carrie, saying that neither he nor his son will ever be safe around her. Saul asks Carrie to rejoin the CIA, but she declines his offer. Düring essentially proposes to her, giving her a chance to co-head his Foundation. She <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>answer</b> him, and he gives her time to think about it.|$|E
25|$|Socrates {{admits that}} Protagoras has given an {{excellent}} answer {{and that there}} is only one small thing to clarify which he is certain that the Sophist will do easily. He asks Protagoras as to whether the attributes that form virtue, such as bravery, kindness and wisdom are one or many things, like for example the parts of a golden object which are fused together or that of a face which form a whole while retaining their individual substance (329d). Protagoras answers the second but avoids engaging in dialogue and digresses into a rhetoric which <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>answer</b> the question sufficiently but still manages to arouse the excitement of their young public. Socrates complains that Protagoras is long-winded, like a gong that booms when you strike it and won't stop until you lay a hand on it. It is a typical moment of Socrates opposite a Sophist where the latter is using eloquent speech to hide arguments that might not stand logical scrutiny while the former is trying to use his notorious question/answer format that will lead to a logical conclusion in his favour. Protagoras begins to bristle at this and so Socrates supposes that their styles are opposite. He personally doesn't like long-winded speeches like the one Protagoras just delivered, because he is forgetful and cannot follow the train of thought (334d), and Protagoras does not like to be peppered with questions that seem to lead them off track. Socrates gets up to leave, grousing that companionable talk is one thing and public speaking another (336b). After the intervention of several of the listeners, the men agree to compromise their styles so the discussion can continue.|$|E

He asks Johnson about [...] "Cobra" [...] and threatens to kill Johnson if he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>answer.</b> Johnson unconsciously lifts his arm and a ray shoots out of his hand, killing Vaiken. The shot explodes Johnson's arm, revealing the Psychogun embedded in it.|$|E
500|$|While {{trying to}} learn more about Rita's accident, Betty and Rita go to Winkie's and are served by a {{waitress}} named Diane, which causes Rita to remember the name [...] "Diane Selwyn." [...] They find Diane Selwyn in the phone book and call her, but she <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>answer.</b> Betty goes to an audition, where her performance is highly praised. A casting agent takes her to a soundstage where a film called The Sylvia North Story, directed by Adam, is being cast. When Camilla Rhodes auditions, Adam capitulates to casting her. Betty locks eyes with Adam, but she flees before she can meet him, saying she is late to meet a friend.|$|E
500|$|As Regina tends {{the apple}} tree, Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) offers to help Regina {{get rid of}} Emma, for a price. Regina says {{that she is not}} in the {{business}} of making deals with him anymore, and Gold acknowledges that she had made a deal with him in the past to procure Henry. He asks Regina how she chose the name Henry; she <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>answer.</b> She questions him about Emma's past, and he is equally evasive. When Gold attempts to walk away, Regina presses him for an answer, causing Gold to say [...] "please", forcing Regina to obey. As Gold walks away, Regina watches in shock and worry, suggesting that she suspects that Gold remembers their lives in the Enchanted Forest.|$|E

At {{the end of the}} evening, Michael mistakenly thinks that he and Pam have a connection, and is rejected when he tries to kiss her. She gives him a ride home on the condition that he sit in the back seat. Jim tries to bicycle home but is too drunk and an amused Karen gives Jim a ride.|$|E
500|$|Black and Horn {{realize that}} the killer will have chosen the {{optician}} as his next victim, and agree to set another trap with her as the bait. Horn, more and more unhinged throughout the case, begins imagining the killer and his van at every turn. As he and Black wait for the killer to make an attempt on the optician's life, Horn admits that he cannot trust himself to be there, and is told to go home. However, he parks his car on the route towards the trap, feigning a flat tyre. When the killer's van attempts to pass, Horn attacks him, but the police arrive in time to stop him beating the killer to death. The attack renders any evidence found in the van inadmissible in court, although Black tells him enough evidence was found at the killer's home to secure a conviction. Later, Horn asks Black how he can deal with cases like this on a regular basis. [...] Black <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>answer,</b> but later comforts his daughter after another bad dream.|$|E
500|$|Bradley and Buell {{conclude}} that [...] "although no single {{segment of the}} Balkan campaign forced the Germans to delay Barbarossa, obviously the entire campaign did prompt them to wait." [...] On the other hand, Richter calls Eden's arguments a [...] "falsification of history". Basil Liddell Hart and de Guingand {{point out that the}} delay of the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union was not among Britain's strategic goals and as a result the possibility of such a delay could not have affected its decisions about Operation Marita. In 1952, the Historical Branch of the UK Cabinet Office concluded that the Balkan Campaign had no influence on the launching of Operation Barbarossa. According to Robert Kirchubel, [...] "the main causes for deferring Barbarossa's start from 15 May to 22 June were incomplete logistical arrangements and an unusually wet winter that kept rivers at full flood until late spring." [...] This however <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>answer</b> whether in the absence of these problems the campaign could have begun according to the original plan. Keegan writes: ...|$|E
