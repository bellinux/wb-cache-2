5|$|Bilins are found, for example, in Micrommata virescens, {{resulting}} in its green color. <b>Guanine</b> {{is responsible for}} the white markings of the European garden spider Araneus diadematus. It is in many species accumulated in specialized cells called guanocytes. In genera such as Tetragnatha, Leucauge, Argyrodes or Theridiosoma, <b>guanine</b> creates their silvery appearance. While <b>guanine</b> is originally an end-product of protein metabolism, its excretion can be blocked in spiders, leading to an increase in its storage. Structural colors occur in some species, which are the result of the diffraction, scattering or interference of light, for example by modified setae or scales. The white prosoma of Argiope results from hairs reflecting the light, Lycosa and Josa both have areas of modified cuticle that act as light reflectors.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of living organisms encode their genes in long strands of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). DNA consists of a chain made from four types of nucleotide subunits, each composed of: a five-carbon sugar (2'-deoxyribose), a phosphate group, {{and one of the}} four bases adenine, cytosine, <b>guanine,</b> and thymine.|$|E
5|$|Two {{chains of}} DNA twist {{around each other}} to form a DNA double helix with the phosphate-sugar {{backbone}} spiralling around the outside, and the bases pointing inwards with adenine base pairing to thymine and <b>guanine</b> to cytosine. The specificity of base pairing occurs because adenine and thymine align to form two hydrogen bonds, whereas cytosine and <b>guanine</b> form three hydrogen bonds. The two strands in a double helix must therefore be complementary, with their sequence of bases matching such that the adenines of one strand are paired with the thymines of the other strand, and so on.|$|E

40|$|Neisseria gonorrhoeae {{undergoes}} {{phase variation}} {{to adapt to}} new environments, increase pathogenesis, and evade the host immune system. This {{may be due to}} defects in DNA repair. A reporter system was created to detect phase variation by phenotypic switching from a nitrofuran-sensitive phenotype to a nitrofuran-resistant (NitR) phenotype. Strains were created with poly-guanine tracts from 5 to 12 <b>guanines</b> in the coding region of a nitroreductase gene (nfsB) that would be susceptible to frame-shifting mutations during DNA replication. The minimum number of consecutive <b>guanines</b> needed to observe increased mutation was 5. A strain expressing 7 <b>guanines</b> nfsB possessed nitroreductase activity similar to wild-type and a spontaneous mutation frequency that was increased ~ 104 fold relative to wild-type. Frame-shifting mutations of strain expressing 8 <b>guanines</b> in nfsB were observed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Future work with the reporter system could lead to new understanding of phase variation and DNA repair...|$|R

The observed progressive lowering of the first voltammetric peak potential {{as the number of}} adjacent <b>guanines</b> increases unambiguously points toward the establishment of delocalized hole domains; the hole stabilization energy is ca. 0. 1 eV per GG step, significantly lower than that observed for AA step...|$|R
5|$|In a DNA double helix, {{each type}} of nucleobase on one strand bonds with just one type of nucleobase on the other strand. This is called {{complementary}} base pairing. Here, purines form hydrogen bonds to pyrimidines, with adenine bonding only to thymine in two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine bonding only to <b>guanine</b> in three hydrogen bonds. This arrangement of two nucleotides binding together across the double helix is called a Watson-Crick base pair. Another type of base pairing is Hoogsteen base pairing where two hydrogen bonds form between <b>guanine</b> and cytosine. As hydrogen bonds are not covalent, they can be broken and rejoined relatively easily. The two strands of DNA in a double helix can thus be pulled apart like a zipper, either by a mechanical force or high temperature. As {{a result of this}} base pair complementarity, all the information in the double-stranded sequence of a DNA helix is duplicated on each strand, which is vital in DNA replication. This reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions of DNA in living organisms.|$|E
5|$|Only {{three classes}} of pigment (ommochromes, bilins and <b>guanine)</b> have been {{identified}} in spiders, although other pigments have been detected but not yet characterized. Melanins, carotenoids and pterins, very common in other animals, are apparently absent. In some species, the exocuticle of the legs and prosoma is modified by a tanning process, resulting in brown coloration.|$|E
5|$|These codes make {{it easier}} and shorter to write down the amino acid {{sequences}} that make up proteins. The nucleotide bases {{are made up of}} purines (adenine and <b>guanine)</b> and pyrimidines (cytosine and thymine or uracil). These nucleotide bases make up DNA and RNA. These nucleotide base codes make the genome of an organism much smaller and easier to read.|$|E
40|$|The European Standards Committee on Oxidative DNA Damage (ESCODD) {{was set up}} {{to resolve}} the {{problems}} associated with the measurement of background levels of oxidative DNA damage (in particular 8 -oxo- 7, 8 -dihydroguanine, or 8 -oxoGua) in human cells. A tendency for DNA oxidation to occur during sample preparation prior to chromatography has been recognized as the source of a very substantial artefact. To assess the success of attempts to eliminate the artefact, ESCODD has distributed to its members standard samples of pig liver and HeLa cells for analysis. Estimates of 8 -oxoGua in pig liver, using chromatographic techniques, ranged from 2. 23 to 441 per 10 * 6 <b>guanines,</b> with a median of 10. 47 per 10 * 6 <b>guanines.</b> Chromatographic analysis of HeLa cell DNA gave a range of 1. 84 to 214 per 10 * 6 <b>guanines</b> with a median of 5. 23 per 10 * 6 <b>guanines.</b> HeLa cell DNA was also analysed by an enzymic approach, in which whole cell DNA was treated with formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase, which nicks DNA at sites of 8 -oxoGua, and the breaks measured with the comet assay, alkaline unwinding or alkaline elution. Values with these methods ranged from 0. 06 to 4. 988 -oxoGua per 10 * 6 <b>guanines,</b> with a median of 0. 79 per 10 * 6 <b>guanines.</b> Although there are clearly still serious discrepancies between methods and laboratories, the lowest estimates by chromatography (arguably those in which the artefact was best controlled) are only 2. 5 times higher than the median value obtained with the enzymic approach...|$|R

The resulting [3 H]tRNA was purified from control and MSO-exposed cells at several time points during the incubation and was hydrolyzed to [3 H]guanine and four [3 H]methyl <b>guanines</b> which were separated by high pressure liquid chromatography. Three of the four [3 H]methyl <b>guanines</b> were more highly labeled in the [3 H]tRNA of the MSO-exposed cells, relative to that of the control cells throughout the entire incubation period. The findings extend to cultured astrocytes, the stimulatory effect of MSO on the methylation of neural tRNA <b>guanines,</b> previouly observed both in vitro using [14 C] S -adenosyl- l -methionine and in vivo using [methyl 3 -H] l -methionine...|$|R

The electrons induced DNA damage, which was analyzed with fluorescence and infrared spectroscopy methods. The damage {{was identified as}} strand breaks and found to correlate linearly {{with the number of}} <b>guanines</b> in the sequence.

5|$|Building {{blocks of}} DNA (adenine, <b>guanine,</b> and related organic molecules) {{may have been}} formed extraterrestrially in outer space. Complex DNA and RNA organic {{compounds}} of life, including uracil, cytosine, and thymine, have also been formed in the laboratory under conditions mimicking those found in outer space, using starting chemicals, such as pyrimidine, found in meteorites. Pyrimidine, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the most carbon-rich chemical found in the universe, may have been formed in red giants or in interstellar cosmic dust and gas clouds.|$|E
5|$|Cells {{are known}} to {{eliminate}} three types of damage to their DNA by chemically reversing it. These mechanisms do not require a template, since the types of damage they counteract can occur in {{only one of the}} four bases. Such direct reversal mechanisms are specific to the type of damage incurred and do not involve breakage of the phosphodiester backbone. The formation of pyrimidine dimers upon irradiation with UV light results in an abnormal covalent bond between adjacent pyrimidine bases. The photoreactivation process directly reverses this damage by the action of the enzyme photolyase, whose activation is obligately dependent on energy absorbed from blue/UV light (300–500nm wavelength) to promote catalysis. Photolyase, an old enzyme present in bacteria, fungi, and most animals no longer functions in humans, who instead use nucleotide excision repair to repair damage from UV irradiation. Another type of damage, methylation of <b>guanine</b> bases, is directly reversed by the protein methyl <b>guanine</b> methyl transferase (MGMT), the bacterial equivalent of which is called ogt. This is an expensive process because each MGMT molecule can be used only once; that is, the reaction is stoichiometric rather than catalytic. A generalized response to methylating agents in bacteria is known as the adaptive response and confers a level of resistance to alkylating agents upon sustained exposure by upregulation of alkylation repair enzymes. The third type of DNA damage reversed by cells is certain methylation of the bases cytosine and adenine.|$|E
5|$|Gram-positive {{bacteria}} usually develop {{resistance to}} linezolid {{as the result}} of a point mutation known as G2576T, in which a <b>guanine</b> base is replaced with thymine in base pair 2576 of the genes coding for 23S ribosomal RNA. This is the most common mechanism of resistance in staphylococci, and the only one known to date in isolates of E. faecium. Other mechanisms have been identified in Streptococcus pneumoniae (including mutations in an RNA methyltransferase that methylates G2445 of the 23S rRNA and mutations causing increased expression of ABC transporter genes) and in Staphylococcus epidermidis.|$|E
40|$|Clerocidin, a diterpenoid with {{antibacterial}} and antitumor activity, stimulates {{in vitro}} DNA cleavage mediated by mammalian and bacterial topoisomerase (topo) II. Different from the classical topoisomerase poisons, clerocidin-stimulated breaks at <b>guanines</b> immediately preceding {{the sites of}} DNA cleavage are not resealed upon heat or salt treatment. To understand the mechanism of irreversible trapping of the topo II-cleavable complex, we have investigated the reactivity of clerocidin per se towards DNA. We show here that the drug is able to nick negatively supercoiled plasmids. DNA cleavage by clerocidin in enzyme-free medium {{is due to the}} ability of the drug to form covalent adducts with <b>guanines.</b> Indeed, clerocidin was able to specifically react with short oligonucleotides when the <b>guanines</b> were unpaired and exposed as in bulges or in the single-strand form. The clerocidin epoxy group attacks the nitrogen at position 7 of <b>guanines,</b> leading to strand scission at the modified site. Our findings also demonstrate that trapping of topoisomerases by clerocidin is specific for type II enzymes. The guanine-alkylating ability of clerocidin suggests an unprecedented mechanism of topo II poisoning, according to which the enzyme renders the drug reactive toward DNA by distorting the double-helical structure of the nucleic acid at the cleavage site...|$|R
40|$|Positioning {{of release}} factor eRF 1 toward adenines and the ribose-phosphate {{backbone}} of the UAAA stop signal in the ribosomal decoding site was studied using messenger RNA (mRNA) analogs containing stop signal UAA/UAAA and a photoactivatable cross-linker at definite locations. The human eRF 1 peptides cross-linked to these analogs were identified. Cross-linkers on the adenines at the 2 nd, 3 rd or 4 th position modified eRF 1 near the conserved YxCxxxF loop (positions 125 – 131 in the N domain), but cross-linker at the 4 th position mainly modified the tripeptide 26 -AAR- 28. This tripeptide cross-linked also with derivatized 3 ′-phosphate of UAA, while the same cross-linker at the 3 ′-phosphate of UAAA modified both the 26 – 28 and 67 – 73 fragments. A comparison of the results with those obtained earlier with mRNA analogs bearing a similar cross-linker at the <b>guanines</b> indicates that positioning of eRF 1 toward adenines and <b>guanines</b> of stop signals in the 80 S termination complex is different. Molecular modeling of eRF 1 in the 80 S termination complex showed that eRF 1 fragments neighboring <b>guanines</b> and adenines of stop signals are compatible with different N domain conformations of eRF 1. These conformations vary by positioning of stop signal purines toward the universally conserved dipeptide 31 -GT- 32, which neighbors <b>guanines</b> but is oriented more distantly from adenines...|$|R
40|$|In the {{preceding}} paper in this journal, we described the solution {{structure of the}} nitrous acid cross-linked dodecamer duplex [d(GCATCCGGATGC) ] 2 (the cross-linked <b>guanines</b> are underlined). The structure revealed that the cross-linked <b>guanines</b> form a nearly planar covalently linked ‘G:G base pair’, with the complementary partner cytidines flipped out of the helix. Here we explore the flanking sequence context effect {{on the structure of}} nitrous acid cross-links in [d(CG) ] 2 and the factors allowing the extrahelical cytidines to adopt such fixed positions in the minor groove. We have used NMR spectroscopy to determine the solution structure of a second cross-linked dodecamer duplex, [d(CGCTACGTAGCG) ] 2, which shows that the identity of the flanking base pairs significantly alters the stacking patterns and phosphate backbone conformations. The cross-linked <b>guanines</b> are now stacked well on adenines preceding the extrahelical cytidines, illustrating the importance of purine– purine base stacking. Observation of an imino proton resonance at 15. 6 p. p. m. provides evidence for hydrogen bonding between the two cross-linked <b>guanines.</b> Preliminary structural studies on the cross-linked duplex [d(CGCGACGTCGCG) ] 2 show that the extrahelical cytidines are very mobile in this sequence context. We suggest that favorable van der Waals interactions between the cytidine and the adenine 2 bp away from the cross-link localize the cytidines in the previous cross-linked structures...|$|R
5|$|In fish {{such as the}} herring which live in {{shallower}} water, {{the mirrors}} must reflect a mixture of wavelengths, and the fish accordingly has crystal stacks {{with a range of}} different spacings. A further complication for fish with bodies that are rounded in cross-section is that the mirrors would be ineffective if laid flat on the skin, as they would fail to reflect horizontally. The overall mirror effect is achieved with many small reflectors, all oriented vertically. Silvering is found in other marine animals as well as fish. The cephalopods, including squid, octopus and cuttlefish, have multi-layer mirrors made of protein rather than <b>guanine.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nucleotides {{are made}} from amino acids, carbon dioxide and formic acid in {{pathways}} that require large amounts of metabolic energy. Consequently, most organisms have efficient systems to salvage preformed nucleotides. Purines are synthesized as nucleosides (bases attached to ribose).

Pseudouridine (Ψ), in which the linkage between uracil and ribose is changed from a C–N bond to a C–C bond, and ribothymidine (T) are found in various places (the most notable ones being in the TΨC loop of tRNA). Another notable modified base is hypoxanthine, a deaminated adenine base whose nucleoside is called inosine (I). Inosine {{plays a key role}} in the wobble hypothesis of the genetic code.|$|E
40|$|RepA, the {{replication}} initiator protein of plasmid P 1, binds {{to specific}} 19 bp sequences on the plasmid DNA. Earlier footprinting studies with dimethylsulfate identified the <b>guanines</b> that contact RepA through the major groove of DNA. In this study, base elimination {{was used to}} identify the contribution of all four bases to the binding reaction. Depurination and depyrimidation of any base {{in the neighborhood of}} the contacting <b>guanines</b> was found to decrease RepA binding. These results are consistent with the notion that RepA contacts bases of two consecutive major grooves on the same face of DNA. We also observed that depurination but not methylation of three <b>guanines</b> (G 3, G 8 and G 9) affected binding. We identified the DNA phosphate groups (3 in the top strand, one of which mapped between G 8 and G 9, and 4 in the bottom strand, one of which was adjacent to C 3) that strongly interfered with RepA binding upon ethylation. These results indicate that certain bases (e. g. G 3, G 8 and G 9) may not contact RepA directly but contribute to base and backbone contacts by maintaining proper structure of the binding site...|$|R
40|$|The {{positions}} of adenines, <b>guanines,</b> and pyrimidines {{can be determined}} by partial nuclease digestion of a terminally labeles RNA molecule. In urea, at elevated temperatures, RNase T 1 generates a pattern reflecting cleavage at <b>guanines</b> while RNase U 2 cleaves only at adenine. A limited alkaline hydrolysis provides a continuum of fragments derived from breaks at every phosphodiester bond. The reaction products are electrophoretically fractionated by size in adjacent lanes of a polyacrylamide gel. An autoradiograph of the gel displays the sequence up to 100 nucleotides {{from the end of}} the molecule, although uracil cannot as yet be distinguished from cytosine.

40|$|The melting of tetramolecular DNA or RNA quadruplexes is kinetically irreversible. However, {{rather than}} being a hindrance, this kinetic inertia allows us to study {{association}} and dissociation processes independently. From a kinetic point of view, the association reaction is fourth order in monomer and the dissociation first order in quadruplex. The association rate constant kon, expressed in M− 3 ·s− 1 decreases with increasing temperature, reflecting a negative activation energy (Eon) for the sequences presented here. Association is favored {{by an increase in}} monocation concentration. The first-order dissociation process is temperature dependent, with a very positive activation energy Eoff, but nearly ionic strength independent. General rules may be drawn up for various DNA and RNA sequence motifs, involving 3 – 6 consecutive <b>guanines</b> and 0 – 5 protruding bases. RNA quadruplexes are more stable than their DNA counterparts as a result of both faster association and slower dissociation. In most cases, no dissociation is found for G-tracts of 5 <b>guanines</b> or more in sodium, 4 <b>guanines</b> or more in potassium. The data collected here allow us to predict the amount of time required for 50 % (or 90 %) quadruplex formation as a function of strand sequence and concentration, temperature and ionic strength...|$|R

The name poly(A) tail (for polyadenylic acid tail) reflects the way RNA nucleotides are abbreviated, with a letter for the base the nucleotide contains (A for adenine, C for cytosine, G for <b>guanine</b> and U for uracil). RNAs are produced (transcribed) from a DNA template. By convention, RNA sequences are written in a 5' to 3' direction.

Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a chain of nucleotides, but unlike DNA it is more often found in nature as a single-strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double-strand. Cellular organisms use messenger RNA (mRNA) to convey genetic information (using the letters G, U, A, and C to denote the nitrogenous bases <b>guanine,</b> uracil, adenine, and cytosine) that directs synthesis of specific proteins.

In the deep waters that the hatchetfish lives in, only blue light with a wavelength of 500 nanometres percolates down and needs to be reflected, so mirrors 125 nanometres apart provide good camouflage.|$|E
40|$|Residues 2, 6, 8 and 10 of Mnt {{repressor}} are {{the major}} determinants of operator DNA binding and recognition. Here, we investigate the interaction of wild-type Mnt and mutants bearing the Arg 2 [...] Lys, His 6 [...] Ala, Asn 8 [...] Ala and Arg 10 [...] Lys mutations with operator DNA modified by methylation or by symmetric base substitutions. The wild-type pattern of methylation interference is altered in specific ways {{for each of the}} mutant proteins. In addition, some of the mutant proteins show a 'loss of contact' phenotype with specific mutant operators. Taken together, these and previous results predict the following contacts between side chains in the Mnt tetramer and operator DNA: Arg 2 recognizes the <b>guanines</b> at operator positions 10 and 12; His 6 contacts the <b>guanines</b> at operator positions 5 and 17; Asn 8 contacts operator positions 4, 7, 15 and 18; Arg 10 contacts the <b>guanines</b> at operator positions 8 and 14.

40|$|International audienceThe HIV- 1 nucleocapsid protein (NC) {{is a small}} basic protein {{containing}} two zinc fingers (ZF) {{separated by}} a short linker. It is involved in several steps of the replication cycle and acts as a nucleic acid chaperone protein in facilitating nucleic acid strand transfers occurring during reverse transcription. Recent analysis of three-dimensional structures of NC-nucleic acids complexes established a new property: the unpaired <b>guanines</b> targeted by NC are more often inserted in the C-terminal zinc finger (ZF 2) than in the N-terminal zinc finger (ZF 1). Although previous NMR dynamic studies were performed with NC, the dynamic behavior of the linker residues connecting the two ZF domains remains unclear. This prompted us to investigate the dynamic behavior of the linker residues. Here, we collected 15 N NMR relaxation data and used {{for the first time}} data at several fields to probe the protein dynamics. The analysis at two fields allows us to detect a slow motion occurring between the two domains around a hinge located in the linker at the G 35 position. However, the amplitude of motion appears limited in our conditions. In addition, we showed that the neighboring linker residues R 29, A 30, P 31, R 32, K 33 displayed restricted motion and numerous contacts with residues of ZF 1. Our results are fully consistent with a model in which the ZF 1 -linker contacts prevent the ZF 1 domain to interact with unpaired <b>guanines,</b> whereas the ZF 2 domain is more accessible and competent to interact with unpaired <b>guanines.</b> In contrast, ZF 1 with its large hydrophobic plateau is able to destabilize the double-stranded regions adjacent to the <b>guanines</b> bound by ZF 2. The linker residues and the internal dynamics of NC regulate therefore the different functions of the two zinc fingers that are required for an optimal chaperone activity...|$|R
