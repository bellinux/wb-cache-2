5|$|The Upanishad {{asserts that}} anyone can renounce – this choice is entirely up to the individual, {{regardless}} of which Ashrama (stage of life) he is in. The Jabala Upanishad seems to justify suicide as an individual choice in certain circumstances, a view opposed by earlier Vedic texts and Principal Upanishads. Those too sick may renounce the worldly life in their mind. The Jabala Upanishad presents the Vedanta philosophy view that one who truly renounces lives an ethical life, which includes not injuring anyone in thought, word or deed. Such a sannyasi (renunciate) abandons all rituals, is without attachments to anything or anyone, and <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> {{is devoted to the}} oneness of Atman and Brahman.|$|E

Sometimes the silent partner's interest in the business will not be publicly known. A silent partner is often an investor in the partnership, who is entitled to a share of the partnership's profits. Silent partners may prefer to invest in limited partnerships in order to insulate their personal assets from the debts or liabilities of the partnership.|$|E

The guru <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> initiates, transmits, guides, illuminates, debates and corrects a student in the journey of knowledge and of self-realization. The attribute of the successful guru is to help make the disciple into another guru, one who transcends him, and becomes a guru unto himself, driven by inner spirituality and principles.|$|E
25|$|According to the Buddha {{the path}} to liberation is one of {{progressively}} coming out of delusion (Pali: Moha). This path is therefore regarded as a path of awakening. Progressing along {{the path to}}wards Nirvana one gains insight into {{the true nature of}} things. A Buddha <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> has attained liberation and an understanding of the causal mechanism by means of which sentient beings come into existence. This mechanism is called pratitya samutpada or dependent origination. The knowledge or understanding of this is called bodhi.|$|E

25|$|In Mahayana Buddhism, another {{important}} foundation for moral action is the Bodhisattva ideal. Bodhisattvas are beings which {{have chosen to}} work towards the salvation of all living beings. In Mahayana Buddhist texts, this path of great compassion is promoted as being superior {{to that of the}} Arhat because the Bodhisattva is seen as working for the benefit of all beings. A Bodhisattva <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> arouses a powerful emotion called Bodhicitta (mind of enlightenment) which is a mind which is oriented towards the awakening of oneself and all beings.|$|E

25|$|Etymologically, a notary <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> takes notes. Notes {{are signs}} or cursory {{abbreviations}} {{to record the}} words uttered, {{so that they may}} be reproduced later in ordinary writing. Notaries were at first private secretaries, attached to the service of persons in positions of importance. It was natural for the science of notes to be in high esteem among those employed in recording the transactions of public boards, and for the name notary to be applied to these officials; so that before long the word was used to signify their occupation.|$|E

25|$|An amateur {{photographer}} <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> practices photography as a hobby/passion and {{not necessarily}} for profit. The quality of some amateur work is {{comparable to that of}} many professionals and may be highly specialized or eclectic in choice of subjects. Amateur photography is often pre-eminent in photographic subjects which have little prospect of commercial use or reward. Amateur photography grew during the late 19th century due to the popularization of the hand-held camera. Nowadays it has spread widely through social media and is carried out throughout different platforms and equipment, switching to the use of cell phone as a key tool for making photography more accessible to everyone.|$|E
25|$|Socrates then broaches {{the initial}} {{question}} of whether virtue is one or many things, himself claiming that all virtue is knowledge and therefore one. He argues that the reason people act harmfully, to others or themselves, is because they only see the short term gains while ignoring the long term losses which might outweigh them, just like one makes errors in judging the size of objects that are far away. He says that if men were taught the art of calculating these things correctly, have a more exact knowledge that is, they would not act harmfully (357c–358d). Same goes for bravery. A brave swimmer <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> knows how to swim better and therefore, in a way, all virtues are essentially knowledge and can be considered one and the same, more like parts of golden objects (as discussed above) rather than the parts of a face. While Socrates seems to have won the argument, {{he points to the}} fact that if all virtue is knowledge, it can in fact be taught. He draws the conclusion that to an observer he and Protagoras would seem as crazy, having argued at great lengths only to mutually exchanged positions with Socrates now believing that virtue can be taught and Protagoras that all virtues are one instead of his initial position (361a). Protagoras acknowledges Socrates a notable opponent in dispute while being much younger than he and predicts that he could become one of the wisest men alive. Socrates departs for whatever business he claimed he had when he wanted to end the dialogue earlier.|$|E

Provisions for this cult were produced in several agricultural estates set up during Djedkare's reign. The names of some of these estates have been found inscribed on the walls of the tombs of his courtiers: [...] "Ra desires that Isesi lives", [...] "Heqa desires that Izezi live", [...] "Perfect of emulation is Isesi", [...] "The mnza-vessel of Djedkare", [...] "Perfect of favors is Isesi", [...] "Seshat makes Isesi live", [...] "The Ka of Isesi is foremost", [...] "Dominion belongs to Izezi", [...] "Work of the command of Izezi", [...] "Bastet wishes that Izezi lives", [...] "Horus perpetuates Izezi", [...] "The offerings of Izezi", and [...] "Izezi <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> loves life".|$|E

Despite her success, Streep has always been modest about her own acting and achievements in cinema. She has stated that she has no particular method when it comes to acting, learning from the days of her early studies that she cannot articulate her practice. She said in 1987, [...] "I have a smattering of things I've learned from different teachers, but nothing I can put into a valise and open it up and say, 'Now which one would you like?' Nothing I can count on and that makes it more dangerous. But then the danger makes it more exciting."

[...] In The New York Times Craig Claiborne wrote admiringly of David, but remarked that because she assumed her readers already knew the basics of cooking she would be [...] "valued more by those with a serious regard for food than by those with a casual interest". [...] The writer Julian Barnes commented that as an amateur cook he found David's terse instructions intimidating: of a recipe in Italian Food [...] he wrote, [...] "E.D.'s first sentence reads like this: 'Melt 1½ lbs (675 g) chopped and skinned tomatoes in olive oil'... Melt? Melt a tomato?... Could it be that Elizabeth David was too good a writer to be a food writer?". A later cook, Tom Parker Bowles, observes, [...] "You don't turn to Elizabeth David for nannying, step-by-step instruction, or precise amounts and timing. She assumes you know the basics, and is a writer who offers inspiration, and wonderful, opinionated prose. Her recipes are timeless, and all her books wonderful works of reference (and tirelessly researched) as well as beautiful reads." ...|$|E
