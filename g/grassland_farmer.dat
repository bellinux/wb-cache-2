40|$|Perennial weeds like Rumex spp. and Cirsium arvense {{are still}} {{difficult}} to control in organic farming systems. The presented results {{were part of a}} cooperative project within the Federal Organic Farming Scheme (BÖL) dealing with the control of perennial weeds. Aim of the project was to evaluate present strategies for controlling perennial weeds in organically managed farms and to determine new recommendations. A nation-wide survey of over 150 organic farmers in Germany showed, that ca. 30 % of the arable land is infested with the Canadian thistle (Cirsium arvense). Most of the farmers (n= 140) have problems with C. arvense as well as Rumex spp. and/or Agropyron repens. The impact of soil tillage and crop rotation on controlling C. arvense in organic farming was investigated on an agricultural field organically managed at the BBA for several years. It could be proved that by growing highly competitive crops like clover-grass mixture and winter rye shoot densities of C. arvense could be reduced, partly in combination with an increased use of a wing share cultivator. After one-year clover-grass mixture, being mulched three times, the highest decrease of C. arvense abundances was found: At 73 % of the measuring points a decrease of shoot densities of over 50 % was observed. Another strategy, ploughing twice, in autumn and spring, reduced density of C. arvense to a similar extent. In contrast to this a high intensity of stubble cultivation (up to three uses) combined with less competitive crops was not successful. Dock species are presently a particular problem in organically managed grassland. Due to their varying reproduction and survival strategies up to now it has not been possible to control them effectively and above all permanently. The nationalwide survey showed that 85 % of the <b>grassland</b> <b>farmer</b> (n= 108) have problems with Rumex spp [...] 20 measures – cutting the dock manually or mechanically with WUZI (an automotive machine built by an Austrian farmer) - are an effective instrument for controlling dock. The disadvantage however is the amount of work and the costs this involves. As a result, only 4 % of the organic farmers actually employ direct control of dock at regular intervals, as the survey demonstrated. Here, the tested automotive machine WUZI offers an innovative answer...|$|E
50|$|The {{decline in}} {{population}} since the Great Famine had been accompanied by the conversion of previously cultivated land into large grazing ranches, so that in many areas most of the local population was still crowded on tiny, uneconomical holdings within sight of open, untilled fields. At the very place in Westport where in 1879 Parnell once launched the Irish Land League, {{and in response to}} the near-famine of 1897-98, O’Brien established a new organisation, the United Irish League (UIL) in January 1898 under the banner of ‘’The Land for the People’. The League had as its prime declared object the breaking up of the large <b>grassland</b> <b>farmers,</b> by compelling them to surrender their lands voluntarily to the Congested Districts Board, established by Balfour in 1891, for redistribution among the tenants of smaller agricultural holdings. It was largely welcomed even among some of the clergy while the authorities on the other hand kept the new movement under close observation.

40|$|Based {{on a large}} {{transnational}} {{research project}} that involved questionnaires with 1000 farm households in nine EU countries and Switzerland, this paper investigates factors influencing farmers' participation in agri-environmental schemes (AESs). Analysis of motivations for AES participation highlights that complex patterns of AESs are in operation. Pronounced geographical differences in farmers' reactions towards schemes can be identified, with responses by farmers from northern member states often differing from those in Mediterranean countries, and with arable farmers often responding differently from <b>grassland</b> <b>farmers.</b> Yet, the study also highlights that much common ground exists and that conceptual frameworks for the understanding of farmers' participation in AESs developed in the United Kingdom can be successfully applied outside the British context. Common participation patterns include the importance of financial imperatives and 'goodness of fit', {{and the influence of}} similar sets of factors such as farm size, tenure, or farm type. The growing importance of conservation-oriented motivations for AES participation across Europe suggests the emergence of a 'new hypothesis' which highlights that the financial imperative for participation does not necessarily exclude an often equally important environmental concern. The paper concludes by indicating where current agri-environmental policy (AEP) may be failing adequately to address structural and socioeconomic characteristics of targeted farming populations, and by arguing that understanding participation decisionmaking is only the first step in an attempt to assess the 'effectiveness' of AEP. Further comparative research is needed to investigate in detail more complex indicators of scheme success, in particular what effects scheme participation has on farmers' incomes, farmers' environmental attitudes, and on the environmental quality of the countryside targeted by AESs. ...|$|R
40|$|Grassland {{agriculture}} {{is experiencing a}} number of threats including declining profitability and loss of area to other land uses including expansion of the built environment {{as well as from}} cropland and forestry. The use of grassland as a natural resource either in terms of existing vegetation and land cover or planting of new species for bioenergy and other nonfood applications presents an opportunity, and potential solution, to maintain the broader ecosystem services that perennial grasslands provide as well as to improve the options for <b>grassland</b> <b>farmers</b> and their communities. This paper brings together different grass or grassland-based studies and considers them as part of a continuum of strategies that, when also combined with improvements in grassland production systems, will improve the overall efficiency of grasslands as an important natural resource and enable a greater area to be managed, replanted or conserved. These diversification options relate to those most likely to be available to farmers and land owners in the marginally economic or uneconomic grasslands of middle to northern Europe and specifically in the UK. Grasslands represent the predominant global land use and so these strategies are likely to be relevant to other areas although the grass species used may vary. The options covered include the use of biomass derived from the management of grasses in the urban and semi urban environment, semi-natural grassland systems as part of ecosystem management, pasture in addition to livestock production, and the planting and cropping of dedicated energy grasses. The adoption of such approaches would not only increase income from economically marginal grasslands, but would also mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from livestock production and help fund conservation of these valuable grassland ecosystems and landscapes, which is increasingly becoming a challenge. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Grassland for {{livestock}} production {{is a major}} form of land use throughout Europe and its intensive management threatens biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in agricultural landscapes. Modest increases to conventional grassland biodiversity could have considerable positive impacts on the provision of ecosystem services, such as pollination, to surrounding habitats. Using a field-scale experiment in which grassland seed mixes and sward management were manipulated, complemented by surveys on working farms and phytometer experiments, the impact of conventional grassland diversity and management on the functional diversity and ecosystem service provision of pollinator communities were investigated. Increasing plant richness, {{by the addition of}} both legumes and forbs, was associated with significant enhancements in the functional diversity of grassland pollinator communities. This was associated with increased temporal stability of flower–visitor interactions at the community level. Visitation networks revealed pasture species Taraxacum sp. (Wigg.) (dandelion) and Cirsium arvense (Scop.) (creeping thistle) to have the highest pollinator visitation frequency and richness. Cichorium intybus (L.) (chichory) was highlighted as an important species having both high pollinator visitation and desirable agronomic properties. Increased sward richness was associated with an increase in the pollination of two phytometer species; Fragaria × ananassa (strawberry) and Silene dioica (red campion), but not Vicia faba (broad bean). Enhanced functional diversity, richness and abundance of the pollinator communities associated with more diverse neighbouring pastures were found to be potential mechanisms for improved pollination. Synthesis and applications. A modest increase in conventional grassland plant diversity with legumes and forbs, achievable with the expertise and resources available to most <b>grassland</b> <b>farmers,</b> could enhance pollinator functional diversity, richness and abundance. Moreover, our results suggest that this could improve pollination services and consequently surrounding crop yields (e. g. strawberry) and wildflower reproduction in agro-ecosystems...|$|R

Finally, this Part will establish why drainage is difficult but vital for agriculture on the Westside. Part III will outline the complications facing drainage implementation on the Westside following the closure of Kesterson Reservoir. It will discuss the legal issues implicated by the Clean Water Act and the TMDL for the lower San Joaquin River. Further, it will explain the legal history of the cases that charged Reclamation with drainage responsibilities and ordered Reclamation to fulfill its duties under the San Luis Act. Part IV profiles the <b>Grassland</b> Area <b>Farmers</b> and Westlands Water District. It describes the GAF’s long-term drainage plan and establishes why it should be encouraged and continued.

40|$|Since {{its passage}} in 1972, the {{majority}} of pollution reduction under the federal Clean Water Act has resulted from technology-based limits imposed on point source dischargers. However, most U. S. water bodies are unmonitored and of those that are, between 40 and 50 percent remain impaired. Given this limited progress, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, multiple state agencies, and non-governmental organizations have proposed water quality trading as a cost-effective means to achieve pollution reductions from point and nonpoint sources. To determine whether these programs actually achieve cost-effective pollution reduction in practice that they promise in theory, I evaluate direct and indirect outcomes associated with three water quality trading cases: the <b>Grassland</b> Area <b>Farmers</b> Tradable Loads Program in California's San Joaquin Valley; the Tar-Pamlico River Basin Nutrient Offset Program in North Carolina; and the Long Island Sound Nitrogen Credit Exchange in Connecticut. Although reallocating reduction efforts through trades to achieve cost-effective solutions is supposedly the major benefit of market-based instruments, only dischargers in the Long Island Sound Nitrogen Credit Exchange actively traded. (cont.) The <b>Grassland</b> Area <b>Farmers</b> abandoned trading {{in favor of a}} more affordable and heavily subsidized management strategy, and members of the Tar-Pamlico Basin Association removed pollution onsite because reductions were less costly than expected and uncertainty over Offset Program parameters impeded planning around trades. Dischargers in the two cases also hesitated to trade because political transaction costs that trading imposed on relationships among entities did not outweigh perceived savings. Connecticut mitigated these costs and uncertainty by administering the Nitrogen Credit Exchange. The major contributions of market-based instruments across cases were facilitating dischargers' willingness to accept more stringent regulations and increasing the institutional capacity for watershed management by encouraging formation of organizations along hydrologic boundaries and information collection and dissemination. These benefits are attributable to the decentralized governance structure in general rather than economic incentives specifically, suggesting that policymakers should consider other decentralized approaches to watershed management. (cont.) If policymakers want dischargers to actively trade, they should design parameters that mitigate uncertainty, market distortions, and political transaction costs. Even if trades never occur, however, indirect outcomes associated with market-based instruments are significant given the ongoing challenges to water quality improvement under the Clean Water Act. by Katherine Hay Wallace.

40|$|Background: Schistosomiasis {{remains a}} major public health problem in China. The major endemic foci are the lake and {{marshland}} regions of southern China, particularly the regions along the middle and lower reach of the Yangtze River in four provinces (Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui). The purpose of our study is to assess {{the effect of a}} new integrated strategy emphasizing infection source control to curb schistosomiasis in marshland regions. Methods: In a longitudinal study, we implemented an integrated control strategy emphasizing infection source control in 16 villages from 2005 through 2012 in marshland regions of Hubei province. The interventions included removing cattle from snail-infested <b>grasslands,</b> providing <b>farmers</b> with mechanized farm equipment, improving sanitation by supplying tap water, building lavatories and latrines, praziquantel chemotherapy, controlling snails, and environmental modification. Results: Following the integrated control strategy designed to reduce the role of bovines and humans as sources of Schistosoma japonicum infection, the prevalence of human S. japonicum infection declined from 1. 7 % in 2005 to 0. 4 % in 2012 (P, 0. 001).

40|$|Given the {{importance}} of rangeland resources {{for the provision of}} forage for livestock grazing, as well as for biodiversity conservation, the definition of management strategies for semi-extensive farming systems has both economic and environmental consequences. Maintenance of extensive farming is, in turn, the main tool to preserve the valuable biodiversity of these ecosystems. In fact, grazing has major impacts on species composition and forage feed value, because livestock foraging strategy, disturbance intensity and grazing history strongly influence the competitive relationships among species. Thus, grazing management has major impacts on ecosystem services provided by semi-natural grasslands, such as aesthetic value (mainly determining the level of touristic attraction of pastoral landscapes), soil conservation, carbon storage, cultural heritage, etc. However, from the farmers’ point of view, low-intensity farming often means intensive human labor and small yield. Therefore, current socio-economic changes such as abandonment of farms and {{reduction in the number of}} people working in mountain agriculture are causing severe land use changes, which led to a dramatic decline of biodiversity in <b>grassland</b> area. The <b>farmer’s</b> income is a key question in grassland biodiversity conservation. The sustainability of extensive farming depends on the conservation of forage resources, but also on the ability to promote animal welfare, which, in turn, is influenced by the amount and quality of food, that produces morphological and functional modifications at different levels of the digestive apparatus. In addition, in Mediterranean areas, trends in climate change mainly cause greater aridity during summer and likely lead to the worsening of extensive farming sustainability. As a consequence of this, the multi-tasking use of grazing activities is a key tool in supporting the extensive farming. Firstly, it has to be considered that the conservation of these open ecosystems is a key element within the European Agricultural Policies, particularly since the 92 / 43 /EEC Directive stated that the conservation of grasslands is a high priority for European farmers, that are largely helped in this direction by financial supports aimed to aware management actions. To this regards, there is a good example represented by the agro-environmental agreement of Marche Region, devoted to a bottom-up setup of strategies for <b>grassland</b> conservation. <b>Farmers</b> that operate following these guidelines receive a financial compensation in addition to those normally made available by the European Agricultural Policies. Moreover, this new task of mountain farmers could be inserted in a wide range of ecosystem services (carbon storage, conservation of aesthetic values, fire prevention, integration of touristic attractors, etc) that might be recognized for the Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) that is one of the key actions inside the UE policies for nature conservation...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a credit point system to assess “wildlife-friendliness” {{at the farm}} scale. Farmers can choose and gain points from 32 habitat management options, most of which account for quantity, quality and spatial distribution of ecological compensation areas (options of the Swiss agri-environment scheme). Additionally, points can be scored by specific arable and <b>grassland</b> measures. <b>Farmers</b> are free to decide which measures to implement. We evaluated the credit point system on 133 farms (2009 – 2011) in the Swiss Lowland Plateau. Occurrence and density of plants, grasshoppers, butterflies and farmland birds were recorded on these farms as biodiversity indicators. The scored points were positively correlated {{with the majority of}} biodiversity indicators. IP-Suisse, the Swiss organisation of integrated agricultural production, incorporated the credit point system into their production guidelines in 2009. All its producers have to reach a defined point score until 2013. As a consequence, two thirds of the involved farmers had to increase their ecological performance. This initiative also put pressure on their organic farming colleagues to reform their guidelines in order to fully exploit their high potential of biodiversity. The products from the farms are labelled by a major retailer as wildlife-friendly and are well-received by consumers. Farmers benefit from bonus payments from the retailer and an enhanced public image. Therefore, the credit point system helps to substantially improve farmland biodiversity. Our results provide evidence that wildlife-friendly farming can create a “win/win situation” for farmers and nature, even in intensively managed regions in the Swiss Lowland Plateau...|$|R

Herbicide spraying and manual weeding have shown to be very effective in reducing above- and below-ground biomass growth in the first 45 days after slashing the grass, with effects persisting in the longer term, but both are expensive methods. Shading seems to be less effective in the short-term, whereas it influences the Imperata growth in the longer term. After one year shading, glyphosate application and weeding significantly reduced aboveground biomass by 94, 67 and 53 %; and belowground biomass by 76, 65 and 58 %, respectively, compared to control.

40|$|Salt {{management}} {{has been a}} challenge to westside farmers since {{the rapid expansion of}} irrigated agriculture in the 1900 s. The soils in this area are naturally salt-affected having formed from marine sedimentary rocks rich in sea salts rendering the shallow groundwater, and drainage return flows discharging into the lower reaches of the San Joaquin River, saline. Salinity problems are affected by the imported water supply from Delta where the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers combine. Water quality objectives on salinity and boron have been in place for decades to protect beneficial uses of the river. However it was the selenium-induced avian toxicity that occurred in the evaporation ponds of Kesterson Reservoir (the terminal reservoir of a planned but not completed San Joaquin Basin Master Drain) that changed public attitudes about agricultural drainage and initiated a steady stream of environmental legislation directed at reducing non-point source pollution of the River. Annual and monthly selenium load restrictions and salinity and boron Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) are the most recent of these policy initiatives. Failure by both State and Federal water agencies to construct a Master Drain facility serving mostly west-side irrigated agriculture has constrained these agencies to consider only In-Valley solutions to ongoing drainage problems. For the Westlands subarea, which has no surface irrigation drainage outlet to the San Joaquin River, innovative drainage reuse systems such as the Integrated Farm Drainage Management (IFDM) offer short- to medium-term solutions while more permanent remedies to salt disposal are being investigated. Real-time salinity management, which requires improved coordination of east-side reservoir releases and west-side drainage, offers some relief to <b>Grasslands</b> Basin <b>farmers</b> and wetland managers - allowing greater salinity loading to the River than under a strict TMDL.

Modern farming methods have been criticised for their negative effect on species-richness and their impact on environment and landscape. There is an increasing wide-spread desire to promote biodiversity and attractive landscapes as well as to retain rural communities. Conservation of biodiversity is primarily a regional goal, not a goal of individual <b>farmers.</b> <b>Grassland</b> management to favour biodiversity will require compromise. Agricultural man-agement influences sward structure vertically and horizontally over space and time. Insights into these relationships are important to understand the mechanisms responsible for changes in the tloris-tic composition and the productivity of grassland. Two case-studies with Trifolium repens L. (white clover) and Festuca pratensis Huds. (meadow fescue) are summarised to identify driving forces for the changes of the yield contribution of selected species in grassland. Canopy structure and growth form of white clover determine the foraging for light, and the weak competitive ability of meadow fescue is caused by a smaller proportion of leaf area in the upper layers of the canopy in interspecific shoot competition. Long-term experiments show that management also influences surprisingly rapid microevolution within individual species. It is concluded that management for habitat heterogeneit...|$|R

Two of them, the Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) and the Grain to Green Program (GTGP), are among the biggest programs in the world because of their ambitious goals, massive scales, huge payments, and potentially enormous impacts. The NFCP conserves natural forests through logging bans and afforestation with incentives to forest enterprises, whereas the GTGP converts cropland on steep slopes to forest and <b>grassland</b> by providing <b>farmers</b> with grain and cash subsidies.

Of the three, the later experiences of the Ise family most closely follow the scenario of western settlement that the mass media have implanted in the minds of most Americans. 1 Henry Ise acquired his first land by homesteading. He and his family endured drought, grasshoppers, and the departure of relatives and neighbors. Henry and Rosie were threatened by debt and by prairie fire, blizzard, and dust storms. They feared the depredations of lawbreakers, suffered the inevitable farm accidents, lost a child to death, and watched in helpless sympathy as another suffered crippling paralysis. Yet, amid the hardships, they broke land, built fences, acquired title, and got still more land. A stone addition was joined to the original log cabin and then, after a good year, they built a two-story house. The stock of farm machinery increased, a windmill appeared at the farmstead, and ultimately, a handsome barn was built. When the mortgage was paid off after years of worry, the family held a celebration; Henry and one of his daughters went to the World 2 ̆ 7 s Fair in Chicago in 2 ̆ 793. And during these family trials and triumphs, the community settled up around the Ises, the railroad came, elevators rose beside it, and the days of pioneering faded into memory. The story of the settling-in process {{is only part of the}} history of the grassland since EuroAmericans began to develop an intensive agriculture there. Pioneer farmers confronted the eastern fringes of the grassland in the early nineteenth century. The initial confrontation was still under way on its western rim during the second and third decades of the twentieth century. By that time generations of farmers farther east who had never broken an acre of virgin prairie or plains country had contributed their life histories to the collective record of the grassland. The unique environment of the grassland, coupled with the excesses of the economic system, periodically forced farmers and policy makers to reassess the potential of portions of this great region. So traumatic indeed were the 2 ̆ 2 dirty thirties 2 ̆ 2 that the reevaluation threatened to become a regional postmortem. Actually, <b>grassland</b> <b>farmers</b> were involved in a number of processes that changed through time and space in various respects and at varying rates: (1) Farmers passed through a life course typical of farm experience, and the amount of family labor available and their plans for the next generation influenced their decision making. (2) Whether immigrant or of families long established in America, frontier farmers were culture bearers, carrying values and unique knowledge that might help or hinder them in adjusting to the demands of a strange environment and a changing industry. (3) Pioneer farmers were engaged in creating new farms from virgin land with all that this involved in the way of land cleanng, sod breaking, fencing, and the erection of farm buildings. (4) Frontier farmers also adjusted to the natural environment as they assessed the degree to which the cropping patterns and management practices with which they were familiar were also effective in their new homes. (5) In general, American farmers became increasingly involved in an exchange economy in which they emphasized the farm enterprise, or combinations of enterprises, that gave them the greatest comparative advantage (or perhaps least disadvantage), and they bought an increasing variety of foods, clothing, and production goods. (6) Since transportation facilities and marketing opportunities and prices changed through time, the farmer 2 ̆ 7 s optimal combination of enterprises might also change periodically. (7) Farm technology also changed after 1820 as agricultural inventors sought to adapt the innovations of an industrial age to the service of the farmer-first primarily in the form of horse-powered machinery, and after 1900, utilizing the power of the steam and internal combustion engines and electricity. (8) Finally, farmers were members of neighborhoods, communities, and a larger society that supplied them with economic goods, services, and markets, helped to shape their goals, and provided social contacts, services, and sanctions as well. Agricultural historians, whatever their geographical focus, have displayed more interest in some of these processes than others, but it is important to remember that the complete regional history will deal adequately with them all...|$|R
30|$|Although {{the overall}} {{demographic}} {{data for the}} study catchment {{was not possible to}} obtain following catchment boundaries, the data were compiled according to administrative structure where the catchment is almost entirely found. The demographic data were limited to three census reports of Ethiopia in 1984, 1994 and 2007; but LULC analyses were between 1957 and 2014. Thus, demographic data were used to see trends of population changes in the study area over larger portion of the study period so that comparison can be made possible among LULC change and population pressure. The data indicated that the total population of Dera wereda was increased from 204, 962 in 1984; 212, 341 in 1994 to 248, 464 in 2007 at an average annual growth rate of 3.6 and 16.9 % respectively (CSA 1991, 1995, 2008). This revealed that population pressure on the land resources increased the demand for farmlands, settlements, fuel wood, and construction materials. The census reports also indicated that most of the total population in the were da (> 90 %) resides in the rural areas where households largely depend on land resources as means of livelihood. This caused expansion of farmlands into shrubs, forests and grasslands; overgrazing; deforestation for household energy consumption and income; and declined arable land percapita in rural areas. These suggest that population growth is a major driving force in LULC dynamics of Gelda catchment. This is consistent with the previous studies in the highlands of Ethiopia (Woldeamlak 2002; Wubalem 2012; Hurni 1988; Mekuria 2005; Tsehaye and Mohammed 2015; Hassen et al. 2015). However, direct field observation and informal interview indicated that the scarcity of forest products for household consumption forced the local population to plant trees around homesteads and protect forests in areas not usable for agriculture in recent times. The expansion of farmlands and bare land in the study area were presumably attributed to the impacts of population pressure mainly in search of additional farmlands, overgrazing and poor farming practices. Sociopolitical influences, especially inse-curity of land tenure; disincentives among farmers for conservation programs; taking some land out of production and placing more pressure on existing farm and <b>grasslands</b> have discouraged <b>farmers</b> from investing in soil conservation practices since 1984 in the study area.|$|R
40|$|Agriculture {{conventionally}} supplies food, {{fiber and}} fuel that consumers can purchase through the market. With the right incentives, farmers {{can also provide}} ecosystem services such as wildlife habitat, climate regulation, surface water flows and waste absorption and breakdown. Such incentives have so far come almost entirely from government-sponsored programs that rely on financial assistance to farmers {{to encourage them to}} alter agricultural practices or input mix to enhance ecosystem services. Programs recently implemented in Costa Rica and Columbia rely on payments by the beneficiaries of the ecosystem services, such as municipal water companies and water users (Pagiola et al. 2002). Few of these programs, however, have attempted to establish a market for ecosystem services in which the beneficiaries of such services pay the suppliers their personal values of ecosystem services in an actual market. Markets for ecosystem services must overcome two major challenges. In order to set prices for ecosystem services at the right level, it is imperative to understand consumers preferences. Farmland, however, has multiple attributes such as wildlife habitat services and landscape view; the marginal rate of substitution among those attributes must be understood to design marketable products for ecosystem services. Moreover, many ecosystem services are public goods for which traditional markets are ill-suited, because many individuals can receive benefits simultaneously regardless of whether they have paid part of the cost of provision. Therefore, consumers have an incentive to free-ride on others. Evidence from previous research on public goods clearly suggests that under-contribution is typical (e. g., Ledyard 1995). The overall goal {{of this study is to}} explore the potential to establish an actual market in which the public can purchase ecosystem services generated by agricultural land. More specifically, this paper evaluates the performance of alternative elicitation methods that are intended to reduce individuals incentives to free-ride on others payments for ecosystem services. Using a choice experiment involving a large-scale mail survey, we first estimate the marginal rate of substitution consumers place on various attributes of farmland including the ecosystem services such land can provide. We further compare the results across different payment mechanisms and examine which ones are capable of revealing demand that is closer to consumers true value. Second, we attempt to establish an actual market in which individuals are asked to purchase a share of a farm contract to provide ecosystem service with real money under different payment mechanisms. We compare the market outcomes with the choice experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the performance of different payment mechanisms for provision of ecosystem services using field experiments both within a hypothetical setting and by developing an actual market. The ecosystem service in question in this study is habitat for a grassland-nesting bird called the Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryivorus). Yellow and black Bobolinks establish ground nests in hay fields from mid-May into early June. Their visibility and entertaining character, combined with evidence that many birds, including bobolinks, are experiencing population declines (Sauer et al. 2004), make the bird a leading candidate to attract public interest in efforts to manage farmland for vulnerable wildlife. Previous studies have established that hay harvesting conducted during the birds five to six week nesting period is devastating to fledgling success (e. g., Mitchell et al. 2000). A fairly moderate shift in the harvest schedule could provide significant refuge for nesting birds while causing some losses of the quantity and quality of the hay harvested. If a market developed that paid farmers acceptable compensation to protect <b>grassland</b> birds, then <b>farmers</b> would have an incentive to add an ecosystem service to their revenue base while enhancing environmental quality for wildlife. In this study, we compare four payment mechanisms applied in field experiments: 1) voluntary contribution mechanism, 2) provision point with a money-back guarantee and proportional rebate of excess contributions (PPMBG-PR), 3) uniform-price, multi-buyer auction and 4) pivotal mechanism. Voluntary contribution mechanism has no provision point but has a money-back guarantee if enough money is not raised. Under PPMBG-PR, the public good is supplied only if a pre-specified amount of money (the provision point) is raised, and contributors receive their money back if the market fails to raise that amount. Under a multi-buyer auction, everyone who is willing to pay above a certain price will pay a price such that the total sum will be enough to cover the cost for a farmer to change harvest practices. Under a pivotal mechanism only those consumers whose payments make a difference in the provision of the good would pay. The pivotal mechanism is incentive compatible and is used as the baseline. We test the following hypotheses on the WTP, market participation rate and total revenue collection: (1) WTP: Voluntary contribution < Multi-buyer Auction < PPMBG-PR < Pivotal (2) Participation rate: Voluntary contribution < PPMBG-PR < Multi-buyer auction < Pivotal (3) Revenue collection: Pivotal < Voluntary < Multi-buyer auction < PPMBG-PR We perform a large-scale cross-mechanism comparison using two types of field experiments, a survey involving hypothetical questions and a functioning market for an ecosystem service. In the survey, the subjects are randomly assigned to one of the elicitation methods. We posit a hypothetical situation involving a market for contracts with farmers, describe the assigned elicitation method and ask respondents to compare several sets of two alternative farm wildlife contracts, each with five attributes presented in a stated-choice format. One of the attributes is to change the timing of hay harvesting to enhance the success of a specified number of bobolink fledglings on a given size of farm. The survey data were collected in fall of 2006. Survey questionnaires were sent to all of the 2, 987 households in Jamestown, Rhode Island. The response rate was about 37 % after accounting for undelivered surveys. Although still preliminary, a key result from the choice experiment is that consumers are least willing to pay for farm wildlife contracts under the voluntary contribution mechanism. The payment method that generated the greatest total purchases of farm wildlife contracts was the multi-buyer auction, followed by the pivotal mechanism and PPMBG-PR, respectively. This result suggests that some features of the payment mechanisms (such as setting of a provision point, fairness and a money-back guarantee) encourage consumers to reveal demand that is closer to each consumer true value of the good than the demand revealed by a simple voluntary contribution mechanism in a field experiment using a hypothetical situation. We are currently in the process of launching an ecosystem-service market in Jamestown by establishing actual farm wildlife contracts with farmers and selling shares of those contracts to consumers. The market will be open to the public for two months during March and April, 2007. Each farm wildlife contract will be tied to one or more of the payment mechanisms and whether each contract will remain effective during the breeding season will depend on the market outcome under each mechanism. Consumers will be randomly assigned to one of the elicitation methods. Using market data, we will compare the actual consumer behavior across alternative methods and also to their willingness to pay as estimated in the survey choice experiment.
