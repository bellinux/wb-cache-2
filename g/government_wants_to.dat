5|$|The agents find Banton at {{the train}} station, but he runs to a poorly lit area. He {{declares}} that walking into his shadow will kill the agents, so Mulder shoots out the overhead lights. Banton allows himself {{to be taken to}} a mental hospital, where he is put in a room with soft light per his own request. He tells the agents that the accident in his lab caused his shadow to behave like a black hole, splitting atoms into component particles and reducing matter into pure energy. Banton claims that the deaths were all accidents, and that the <b>government</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> exploit him. Detective Ryan and her superior officer stop the questioning, declaring the case closed, despite Mulder's objections. Mulder contacts X (Steven Williams), who assures him that the government has no interest in Banton. However, X and two associates later attempt to remove Banton from the hospital by cutting the power. In the process, the two attendants are killed when the emergency lights turn on and Banton's shadow falls upon them. Banton flees from the hospital.|$|E

Sean McElwee, writing for Salon.com concluded of this problem, [...] "This is a prima facie case for de facto censorship...If the <b>government</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> allow its equipment to be used by studios, it needs to grant access to anyone who wants to use it – that is the meaning of pluralism.

2500|$|When first {{ordering}} the pig cull, the Egyptian government asserted {{that it was}} a precaution to forestall national fears of the imminent pandemic. Later, after the pig cull, the government stated that its decision to order the pig cull was directly affected by the global breakout of H5N1 virus, more commonly known as bird flu, several years earlier and a fear that the two strains of viruses could possibly combine to form a more lethal virus. Later, the Egyptian government openly stated that the pig cull was no longer just an act to prevent swine flu; rather, {{it was part of a}} plan to clean up the Zabbaleen and allow them to live in sanitary conditions. According to Sabir Abdel Aziz Galal, chief of the infectious disease department in the Ministry of agriculture, [...] "We want them to live a better life. humanely treated; it's a very difficult life." [...] In contrast to the explanations officially given by the Egyptian government, many other observers, especially in the Western media, as well as the Zabbaleen themselves perceived a religious bias in the execution of the pig cull. In a New York Times article, Slackman asserted that, [...] "The Zabbaleen are Christians. Egypt is a majority Muslim country. The Zabbaleen are convinced that the <b>government</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> use the swine flu scare not to help improve their lives but to get pigs out of Egypt. Islam prohibits eating pork." [...] In another New york Times article, Audi writes, [...] "Most of Egypt's pig farmers are Christians, and some accuse the government of using swine flu fears to punish them economically." [...] According to Rev. Samaan Ibrahim, a priest from a Zabbaleen neighborhood, [...] "The bottom line is pigs are not welcome in Egypt." [...] In an article by the BBC, Fraser argues along a similar line, saying that the Coptic Christian minority were targeted by the government for a main source of their income, the rearing of pigs. A similar opinion is voiced by Engi Wassef in her documentary, Marina of the Zabbaleen. Fahmi and Sutton echo a similar explanation: [...] "The adverse effect of the slaughtering of the pigs on the Zabbaleen's livelihoods might be part of the ongoing gentrification of garbage city for land speculations and the taking over of their recycling economy by entrepreneurial businesses." ...|$|E
