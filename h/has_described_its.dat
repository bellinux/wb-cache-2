500|$|In 1973, Bakshi and Ruddy {{began the}} {{production}} of Harlem Nights, which Paramount was originally contracted to distribute. While Fritz the Cat and Heavy Traffic proved that adult-oriented animation could be financially successful, animated films were still not respected, and Bakshi's pictures {{were considered to be}} [...] "dirty Disney flicks" [...] that were [...] "mature" [...] only for depicting sex, drugs and profanity. Harlem Nights, based on Bakshi's firsthand experiences with racism, was an attack on racist prejudices and stereotypes. Bakshi cast Scatman Crothers, Philip Michael Thomas, Barry White and Charles Gordone in live-action and voice roles, cutting in and out of animation abruptly rather than seamlessly because he wanted to prove that the two mediums could [...] "coexist with neither excuse nor apology". He wrote a song for Crothers to sing during the opening title sequence: [...] "Ah'm a Niggerman". Its structure was rooted {{in the history of the}} slave plantation: slaves would [...] "shout" [...] lines from poems and stories great distances across fields in unison, creating a natural beat. Bakshi <b>has</b> <b>described</b> <b>its</b> vocal style, backed by fast guitar licks, as an [...] "early version of rap".|$|E

2500|$|The Society <b>has</b> <b>described</b> <b>its</b> {{intolerance}} of dissident and divergent doctrinal views within its ranks as [...] "strict", but claims its stance {{is based on}} the scriptural precedent of 2Timothy2:17, 18 in which the Apostle Paul condemns heretics Hymenaeus and Philetus who denied the resurrection of Jesus. It said: [...] "Following such Scriptural patterns, if a Christian (who claims belief in God, the Bible, and Jesus) unrepentantly promotes false teachings, it may be necessary for him to be expelled from the congregation ... Hence, the true Christian congregation cannot rightly be accused of being harshly dogmatic." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the band}} <b>has</b> <b>described</b> <b>its</b> style as [...] "math rock" [...] and [...] "math metal", drummer Matt McDonough said in 2009: [...] "I {{honestly}} don't know what 'math metal' is. I {{made a joke}} early on in Mudvayne's career that we used an abacus in writing. It seems I should be careful making jokes in interviews. I don't really see Mudvayne as an innovator in anything." [...] Music critics and journalists have categorized the band as alternative metal, experimental metal, extreme metal, hard rock, heavy metal, industrial metal, math metal, metalcore, neo-progressive metal, neo-progressive rock, nu metal, progressive rock, progressive metal and shock rock.|$|E

2500|$|The Nair Service Society (NSS) {{was founded}} in 1914. Nossiter <b>has</b> <b>described</b> <b>its</b> purpose at {{foundation}} as being [...] "...to liberate the community from superstition, taboo and otiose custom, to establish a network of educational and welfare institutions, and to defend and advance Nair interests in the political arena." [...] Devika and Varghese believe the year of formation to be 1913 and argue that it was established {{as a reaction to}} perceived communal slights in Travancore. Hindu Nairs were unhappy with the prominence of the Christian community, who held a status on a par with Brahmins and whose members were elected as chairs of various official bodies during a period when the political systems were being modified. The Nairs believed Travancore to be a Hindu state.|$|E

[...] "Return of the Ankh" [...] {{was seen as}} a departure from the experimental work of New Amerykah Part One (4th World War) and a return to the musical style of Badu's earlier catalogue, particularly the jazz elements of Badu's debut, Baduizm (1997). The album's style and production is characterized [...] as being down-tempo, built around soul and jazz. Badu <b>has</b> <b>described</b> <b>its</b> sound as [...] "very analog". According to Exclaim! critic Ryan B. Patrick, New Amerykah Part Two featured a [...] "progressive fusion of 'Neo Soul' Badu with 'Seasoned and Savvy' Badu together at last". [...] " [...] "Window Seat" [...] was compared to the Badu's early work particularly [...] "On & On" [...] and [...] "Otherside of the Game" [...] from her debut album, [...] "Window Seat" [...] contains stomp-and-clap breakdowns built under halting lyrics.|$|E
