5|$|Otto {{found himself}} {{confronted by a}} number of <b>intractable</b> ecclesiastical issues: 1) monasticism, 2) Autocephaly, 3) the king as head of the Church and 4) toleration of other churches.|$|E
5|$|The {{computational}} {{complexity of}} finding a homomorphism between given graphs is prohibitive in general, but a lot is known about special cases that are solvable in polynomial time. Boundaries between tractable and <b>intractable</b> cases have been an active area of research.|$|E
5|$|An {{intrathecal}} pump infuses an opioid such as morphine {{directly into}} the fluid-filled space (the subarachnoid cavity) between the spinal cord and its protective sheath, providing enhanced analgesia with reduced systemic side effects. This can reduce the level of pain in otherwise <b>intractable</b> cases. An anxiolytic or a nonopioid analgesic, and local anesthetics may also be infused along with the opioid.|$|E
5|$|For centuries, the Bedouin {{tracked the}} ancestry of each horse through an oral tradition. Horses of the purest blood {{were known as}} Asil and {{crossbreeding}} with non-Asil horses was forbidden. Mares were the most valued, both for riding and breeding, and pedigree families were traced through the female line. The Bedouin {{did not believe in}} gelding male horses, and considered stallions too <b>intractable</b> to be good war horses, thus they kept very few colts, selling most, and culling those of poor quality.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, even single neurons {{appear to}} be complex and capable of {{performing}} computations. So, brain models that don't reflect this are too abstract to be representative of brain operation; models that do try to capture this are very computationally expensive and arguably <b>intractable</b> with present computational resources. However, the Human Brain Project is {{trying to build a}} realistic, detailed computational model of the entire human brain. The wisdom of this approach has been publicly contested, with high-profile scientists {{on both sides of the}} argument.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Franck {{moved to}} the United States, where he had {{accepted}} a professorship at Johns Hopkins University. The laboratory there was poorly equipped compared {{to the one in}} Göttingen, but he received $10,000 for equipment from the Rockefeller Foundation. A more <b>intractable</b> problem was that the university had no money to hire skilled staff. Franck was concerned about his family members remaining in Germany, and needed money to help them emigrate. He therefore accepted an offer from the University of Chicago, where his work on photosynthesis had attracted interest, in 1938.|$|E
5|$|In {{extreme cases}} of <b>intractable</b> CSF leak, a {{surgical}} lumbar drain has been used. This procedure {{is believed to}} decrease spinal CSF volume while increasing intracranial CSF pressure and volume. This procedure restores normal intracranial CSF volume and pressure while promoting the healing of dural tears by lowering the pressure and volume in the dura. This procedure has led to positive results leading to relief of symptoms for up to one year.|$|E
5|$|In {{two small}} studies of two {{patients}} and another with one patient suffering from recurrent CSF leaks where repeated blood patches failed to form clots and relieve symptoms, the patients received temporary but complete resolution of symptoms with an epidural saline infusion. The saline infusion temporarily restores the volume {{necessary for a}} patient to avoid SIH until the leak can be repaired properly. Intrathecal saline infusion is used in urgent cases such as <b>intractable</b> pain or decreased consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Most {{versions}} of the clique problem are hard. The clique decision problem is NP-complete (one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems). The problem of finding the maximum clique is both fixed-parameter <b>intractable</b> and hard to approximate. And, listing all maximal cliques may require exponential time as there exist graphs with exponentially many maximal cliques. Therefore, much of the theory about the clique problem is devoted to identifying special types of graph that admit more efficient algorithms, or to establishing the computational difficulty of the general problem in various models of computation.|$|E
5|$|The IOC {{has often}} been criticised for being an <b>intractable</b> organisation, with several members on the {{committee}} for life. The presidential terms of Avery Brundage and Juan Antonio Samaranch were especially controversial. Brundage was president for over 20 years, and during his tenure he protected the Olympics from political involvement {{and the influence of}} advertising. He was accused of both racism, for resisting exclusion of apartheid South Africa, and antisemitism. Under the Samaranch presidency, the office was accused of both nepotism and corruption. Samaranch's ties with the Franco regime in Spain were also a source of criticism.|$|E
5|$|The {{declaration}} {{had many}} long-lasting consequences. It greatly increased {{popular support for}} Zionism, {{and led to the}} creation of Mandatory Palestine, which later became Israel and the Palestinian territories. As a result it is considered to have caused the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict, often described as the world's most <b>intractable</b> conflict. Controversy remains over a number of areas, such as whether the declaration contradicted earlier promises the British made to the Sharif of Mecca in the McMahon–Hussein correspondence.|$|E
5|$|Green married Michael Farrar in 1979 while {{practicing}} as {{an emergency}} physician. The marriage was tumultuous, and Farrar filed for divorce in July 1995. Between August and September 1995, Farrar repeatedly fell violently ill, and despite numerous hospitalizations his doctors could not pinpoint {{the source of his}} illness. Green's emotional stability deteriorated and she began to drink heavily, even while supervising her children. On October 24, 1995, the Farrar family home, occupied by Green and the couple's three children, caught fire. Kate Farrar and Debora Green escaped without harm, but despite the efforts of firefighters, Timothy and Kelly Farrar died in the blaze. Investigation showed that trails of accelerant in the house led back to Green's bedroom, and that the source of Michael Farrar's <b>intractable</b> illness had been ricin, a poison served to him in his food by Green.|$|E
5|$|Ransomware {{is a type}} of {{malicious}} software from cryptovirology that threatens to publish the victim's data or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid. While some simple ransomware may lock the system in a way which is not difficult for a knowledgeable person to reverse, more advanced malware uses a technique called cryptoviral extortion, in which it encrypts the victim's files, making them inaccessible, and demands a ransom payment to decrypt them. In a properly implemented cryptoviral extortion attack, recovering the files without the decryption key is an <b>intractable</b> problem – and difficult to trace digital currencies such as Ukash and Bitcoin are used for the ransoms, making tracing and prosecuting the perpetrators difficult. Recent Ransomware attack in 2017 has caused a stir in the world as the attack caused many of the internet connected devices to not work and companies spent a large amount to recover from these attacks.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of the conflict in England gradually began to shift; by the late 1140s, the major fighting in the war was over, giving way to an <b>intractable</b> stalemate, with only the occasional outbreak of fresh fighting. Several of Matilda's key supporters died: in 1147 Robert of Gloucester died peacefully, and Brian Fitz Count gradually withdrew from public life, probably eventually joining a monastery; by 1151 he was dead. Many of Matilda's other followers joined the Second Crusade {{when it was announced}} in 1145, leaving the region for several years. Some of the Anglo-Norman barons made individual peace agreements with each other to secure their lands and war gains, and many were not keen to pursue any further conflict.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{supported}} the idea, believing {{it the best}} solution to an <b>intractable</b> problem. The bill passed, providing for a commission of five representatives, five senators, and five Supreme Court justices. To ensure partisan balance, there would be seven Democrats and seven Republicans; the fifteenth member {{was to be a}} Supreme Court justice chosen by the other four on the commission (themselves two Republicans and two Democrats). Justice David Davis, an independent respected by both parties, was expected to be their choice, but he upset the careful planning by accepting election to the Senate by the state of Illinois and refusing to serve on the commission. The remaining Supreme Court justices were all Republicans and, with the addition of Justice Joseph P. Bradley to the place intended for Davis, the commission had an 8–7 Republican majority. Randall nevertheless favored the compromise, even voting in favor of it in the roll call vote (the Speaker usually does not vote). The commission met and awarded all of the disputed ballots to Hayes by an 8–7 party-line vote.|$|E
25|$|Tractable {{problems}} are frequently identified with {{problems that have}} polynomial-time solutions (P, PTIME); {{this is known as}} the Cobham–Edmonds thesis. Problems that are known to be <b>intractable</b> in this sense include those that are EXPTIME-hard. If NP {{is not the same as}} P, then NP-hard {{problems are}} also <b>intractable</b> in this sense.|$|E

25|$|A {{ketogenic}} diet is a {{diet that}} causes ketosis, a state {{in which there is}} an increased amount of ketones in the body. It is becoming increasingly popular for treating <b>intractable</b> epilepsy.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, Peter Diggle and Richard Gratton {{suggested}} using {{a systematic}} simulation scheme to approximate the likelihood function {{in situations where}} its analytic form is <b>intractable.</b> Their method was based on defining a grid in the parameter space and using it to approximate the likelihood by running several simulations for each grid point. The approximation was then improved by applying smoothing techniques to the outcomes of the simulations. While {{the idea of using}} simulation for hypothesis testing was not new, Diggle and Gratton seemingly introduced the first procedure using simulation to do statistical inference under a circumstance where the likelihood is <b>intractable.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{caesarean}} hysterectomy {{consists of}} a caesarean section followed by {{the removal of the}} uterus. This may be done in cases of <b>intractable</b> bleeding or when the placenta cannot be separated from the uterus.|$|E
25|$|Nitrazepam therapy, {{compared}} with other drug therapies, increases risk of death when used for <b>intractable</b> epilepsy {{in an analysis of}} 302 patients. The risk of death from nitrazepam therapy may be greater in younger patients (children below 3.4 years in the study) with <b>intractable</b> epilepsy. In older children (above 3.4 years), the tendency appears to be reversed in this study. Nitrazepam may cause sudden death in children. It can cause swallowing incoordination, high-peaked esophageal peristalsis, bronchospasm, delayed cricopharyngeal relaxation, and severe respiratory distress necessitating ventilatory support in children. Nitrazepam may promote the development of parasympathetic overactivity or vagotonia, leading to potentially fatal respiratory distress in children.|$|E
25|$|Central {{throughout}} Omar's trajectory is his steady {{descent into}} <b>intractable</b> conflict {{with both the}} Barksdale and Stanfield organizations, initiated by his robberies. Omar is also noted for his close relationships with his partners, and with his guardian and ad hoc banker Butchie.|$|E
25|$|Author Charlotte Brontë {{is often}} {{thought to have}} {{suffered}} from hyperemesis gravidarum. She died in 1855 while four months pregnant, having been afflicted by <b>intractable</b> nausea and vomiting throughout her pregnancy, {{and was unable to}} tolerate food or even water.|$|E
25|$|Perceiving the {{situation}} as <b>intractable</b> and urgent, Radcliffe went on {{to make all the}} difficult decisions himself.

25|$|Jurisdictional {{disputes}} between unions became {{more frequent and}} <b>intractable</b> over time, occupying much of {{the attention of the}} American Federation of Labor (AFL). Nearly 95 percent of all strikes from 1897 to 1914 were jurisdictional strikes. Increasingly, the debate involved a growing battle over craft versus industrial unionism.|$|E
25|$|Colorado law {{permits the}} use of medical {{cannabis}} for eight conditions: cancer, glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, muscle spasms, seizures, severe pain, severe nausea and dramatic weight loss, and muscle atrophy.
