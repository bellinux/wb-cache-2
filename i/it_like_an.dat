5|$|Cuarón {{wanted to}} do {{tracking}} shots, {{in part because the}} producers wanted to film <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> IMAX-style Discovery Channel documentary. Like his previous films, Emmanuel Lubezki did not use prior footage as the starting point of his work on Gravity. Instead, he carried out a search of images from NASA and Roscosmos. He and his team put together a large collection of photographs and picked what was best for the movie. Lubezki said that they based the visuals on descriptions from astronauts, with some artistic license in depicting how the stars looked during the daytime in space. He wanted to incorporate the stars as much as possible to feel as deep as possible and avoid plain darkness and two dimensional feeling.|$|E

And I was kind of looking at <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> outfit. So it was, ‘if this was an outfit, what would this song need now?’ So we had the pretty dress, which was the chorus. We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. ‘But {{what do we need}} to really set this song off? A big, fancy, bow in the hair would really set this song off.’ So when I got to the middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on All The Things She Said. I wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy – hands in the air.|$|E
25|$|For the fruits, {{there are}} all kinds of bananas, coconut, sugarcane, pomegranate, lotus, mang-chi-shi (manggis or mangosteen), {{watermelon}} and lang Ch'a (langsat or lanzones). Mang-chi-shi – is something like a pomegranate, peel <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> orange, it has four lumps of white flesh, sweet and sour taste and very delicious. Lang-ch’a is a fruit similar to Loquat, but larger, contained three blocky white flesh with sweet and sour taste. Sugarcane has white stems, large and coarse, with roots reaching 3 chang (30 feet 7 inches). In addition, all types of squash and vegetables are there, just a shortage of peach, plum and leek.|$|E

25|$|At the time, NASA was {{becoming}} {{more sensitive to the}} strain that had developed between the American and European space programs as a result of European perceptions that NASA had not treated <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> equal during previous collaborations. NASA officials and advisers involved in promoting and planning Cassini–Huygens attempted to correct this trend by stressing their desire to evenly share any scientific and technology benefits resulting from the mission. In part, this newfound spirit of cooperation with Europe was driven by a sense of competition with the Soviet Union, which had begun to cooperate more closely with Europe as ESA drew further away from NASA. Late in 1988, ESA chose Cassini–Huygens as its next major mission and the following year the program received major funding in the US.|$|E
500|$|Blink-182 was the band's first {{release on}} Geffen, which absorbed sister label MCA Records in 2003. Prior to it dissolving, MCA had {{attempted}} to penalize the band for breaking stipulations in their contract {{that they would have}} an album out by a specific quarter. MCA had previously rushed the band into recording Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, but the band had much more freedom with Geffen. [...] "Geffen came down and heard three songs and they said, 'This is the best record you've ever done, this is the record of your career, take as much time as you want, call us when it's done.' It just completely outlined the perspective of putting accounting before creative, and when you're in the entertainment business, you've got to put creative first. It's an art, you've got to look at <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> art, treat <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> art, and then you'll get the best product in the long run." ...|$|E

CGI modeling followed, along with a physical model, which was then used by the CGI department to simulate it being wrapped around Loeb's heart. To create the actual, physical parasite, the crew used a prosthetic chest and CGI to create the parasite, and a pig torso was used when the doctors made the initial incision at the hospital.|$|E

500|$|Later {{experiments}} were devised {{to test the}} mother-child bond with mothers who had themselves been reared in isolation as infants. This early deprivation {{was found to have}} retarded the mothers' emotional development and her ability to engage in intercourse and in turn become pregnant. In response, Harlow and his colleagues created an apparatus to impregnate these mothers they named a [...] "rape rack". Harlow found that once these monkeys gave birth, they cared little for their offspring writing, [...] "these monkey mothers that had never experienced love of any kind were devoid of love for their infants". While some mothers simply ignored their children, Harlow characterized others as [...] "evil" [...] and abusive and in some instances reported them [...] "crushing the infant's face to the floor, chewing off the infant's feet and fingers, and in one case... putting the infant's head in her mouth and crushing <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> eggshell".|$|E
500|$|Nicole is Roman Harris' (Conrad Coleby) {{daughter}} {{and she was}} often mentioned on-screen before producers decided to introduce her into the serial.

Executive producer Cameron Welsh said [...] "She is an exciting talent and I think audiences are going to love her character and respond really well to her." [...] James then moved to Sydney especially for the role. Speaking of working on the serial James stated: [...] "Working on a series like this [...] is the best training you can get, I look at <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> apprenticeship and never forget how lucky I am." [...] Fellow cast member Celeste Dodwell who plays Melody Jones originally auditioned for the part of Nicole. After Coleby who plays Roman quit the serial, James' time with the show was in doubt.|$|E
500|$|A {{receptor}} antagonist {{is a type}} of [...] receptor ligand or {{drug that}} blocks or dampens a biological response by binding to and blocking a receptor rather than activating <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> agonist. They are sometimes called blockers; examples include alpha blockers, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers. In pharmacology, antagonists have affinity but no efficacy for their cognate receptors, and binding will disrupt the interaction and inhibit the function of an agonist or inverse agonist at receptors. Antagonists mediate their effects by binding to the active site or to the allosteric site on a receptor, or they may interact at unique binding sites not normally involved in the biological regulation of the receptor's activity. Antagonist activity may be reversible or irreversible depending on the longevity of the antagonist–receptor complex, which, in turn, depends on the nature of antagonist–receptor binding. The majority of drug antagonists achieve their potency by competing with endogenous ligands or substrates at structurally defined binding sites on receptors.|$|E

500|$|Shooting {{began on}} January 2, 1935, with a {{projected}} budget of US$293,750 ($ as of [...] )– {{almost exactly the}} budget of the original– and an estimated 36-day shooting schedule. On the first day, Karloff waded in the water below the destroyed windmill wearing a rubber suit under his costume. Air got into the suit and expanded <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> [...] "obscene water lilly". Later that day, Karloff broke his hip, necessitating a stunt double. Clive had also broken his leg. Shooting was completed on March 7, 1935. The film was ten days over schedule because Whale shut down the picture for ten days until Heggie became available to play the Hermit. With a final cost of $397,023 ($ as of [...] ), Bride was more than $100,000 ($ as of [...] ) over budget. As originally filmed, Henry died fleeing the exploding castle. Whale re-shot the ending to allow for their survival, although Clive is still visible on-screen in the collapsing laboratory. Whale completed his final cut, shortening the running time from about 90 to 75 minutes and re-shooting and re-editing the ending, only days before the film's scheduled premiere date.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} was not universally affirmative, but Richard Corliss of Time stated that Spielberg [...] "has energized each frame with allusive legerdemain and an intelligent density {{of images and}} emotions." [...] Janet Maslin from The New York Times called the film [...] "a visual splendor, a heroic adventurousness and an immense scope that make it unforgettable." [...] Julie Salamon of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the film as [...] "an edgy, intelligent script by playwright Tom Stoppard, Spielberg has made an extraordinary film out of Mr. Ballard's extraordinary war experience." [...] J. Hoberman from The Village Voice decried that the serious subject was undermined by Spielberg's [...] "shamelessly kiddiecentric" [...] approach. Roger Ebert gave a mixed reaction, [...] "Despite the emotional potential in the story, it didn't much move me. Maybe, like the kid, I decided that no world where you can play with airplanes can be all that bad." [...] On his TV show with Gene Siskel, Ebert said that the film [...] "is basically {{a good idea for}} a film that never gets off the ground." [...] Siskel added, [...] "I don't know what the film is about. It's so totally confused and taking things from different parts. On one hand, if it wants to say something about a child's-eye view of war, you got a movie made by John Boorman called Hope and Glory that was just released that is much better, and much more daring in showing the whimsy that children's view of war is. On the other hand, this film wants to hedge its bet and make <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> adventure film, so you've got like Indiana Jones with the John Malkovich character helping the little kid through all the fun of war. I don't know what Spielberg wanted to do." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, {{based on}} {{abnormalities}} in plumb line deflection by the Andes in Peru, Pierre Bouguer had deduced that less-dense mountains {{must have a}} downward projection into the denser layer underneath. The concept that mountains had [...] "roots" [...] was confirmed by George B.

Therefore, by the mid-1950s, the question remained unresolved as to whether mountain roots were clenched in surrounding basalt or were floating on <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> iceberg.|$|E

[...] Another time, Wilson recalls playing the song's drum intro [...] "ten times until everyone in the room told me to stop, and then I played it ten more times." [...] Mike Love remembers Wilson comparing the song to Einstein's theory of relativity. Music journo David Dalton said that [...] "Brian studied <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> adept memorizing the Koran." [...] In July 1967, he visited Wilson at his home, later writing about a box of tapes he discovered in Wilson's bedroom: [...] "I assumed they were studio demos or reference tracks and threw one on the tape machine.

The instrumental was made on April 6, 1965 at United Western Recorders, requiring 44 takes before Wilson could deem a satisfactory performance. Problems had arisen from the tempo and guitar part in the introduction, which fatigued Wilson, engineer Chuck Britz, and the dozen-plus session players. The song did not appear to have lyrics or a title at this juncture, and Wilson can be heard calling the song [...] "Oh Yeah" [...] and [...] "You're Grass and I'm a Power Mower". Wilson remembers: [...] "When we got into the studio with Chuck, he said that he wanted Carl’s twelve-string guitar in the intro to sound more direct. I didn’t know what that meant. 'Can he play it in the booth?' Chuck said. I had never thought about that before, but {{it seemed like a good}} idea.
