5|$|Details on {{reversing}} warfarin {{are provided}} in clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians. For people with an international normalized ratio (INR) between 4.5 and 10.0, a small dose (about 1000 mcg = one milligram) of oral vitamin K is sufficient. When warfarin <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>given</b> and INR is in therapeutic range, simple discontinuation of the drug for five days is usually enough to reverse the effect and cause INR to drop below 1.5.|$|E
5|$|Continuously {{variable}} phase control circuits {{are common in}} subwoofer amplifiers, and {{may be found in}} crossovers and as do-it-yourself electronics projects. Phase controls allow the listener to change the arrival time of the subwoofer sound waves relative to the same frequencies from the main speakers (i.e., at and around the crossover point to the subwoofer). A similar effect can be achieved with the delay control on many home theater receivers. The subwoofer phase control found on many subwoofer amplifiers is actually a polarity inversion switch. It allows users to reverse the polarity of the subwoofer relative to the audio signal it <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>given.</b> This type of control allows the subwoofer to either be in phase with the source signal, or 180 degrees out of phase.|$|E

Peppermint Butler (voiced by Steve Little) tells Finn that he is trapped in a dream and that he needs to find the King Worm (voiced by Erik Estrada) and break it. The scene shifts, and Finn is at first being fed soup by Flame Princess (voiced by Jessica DiCicco), then he is in a library. Peering through a window, he sees Jake, who <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>given</b> advice on how to wrap a present by a deformed Lady Rainicorn. The two brothers conclude that they are trapped in a dream, and set off, trailing the King Worm.|$|E

5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files.

In this episode, Scully learns that she, but not Mulder, <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>given</b> {{a chance to prove}} her worth at the FBI, and—paired with a new partner—she investigates a crime scene photographer with an uncanny knack for arriving {{just in time to see}} his victims' final moments.

5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the mid-18th century planting, {{although}} there remains, in front of the house, a gnarled black mulberry tree, which was described as ancient in 1822. However, 19th-century drawings and photographs record increasingly elaborate and fussy bedding schemes, finally swept away in the 1960s. Today there is a more informal style, emphasising the architectural character of the garden with its long straight sweeps of wall; it is also an easier style to maintain. In recent years, native wild plants have been allowed to mingle with rare and exotic specimens and continual thought <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>given</b> to contrasting textures and colours of foliage. The lower garden, below the front of the house, now has the air of a small arboretum with a number of fine specimen trees, such as a splendid late-leafing catalpa (an oriental plane tree) dominates this part of the garden and the grass at its foot is left uncut during the Spring, allowing camassias and bluebells to make a fine showing.|$|E

25|$|Rape {{by gender}} classifies types of rape by the sex or gender {{of both the}} rapist and the victim. This scope {{includes}} both rape and sexual assault more generally.

25|$|Efficiency, like resolution, can be {{expressed}} in absolute or relative terms. The same units are used (i.e., percentages); therefore, the spectroscopist must take care to determine which kind of efficiency <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>given</b> for the detector. Absolute efficiency values represent {{the probability that a}} gamma ray of a specified energy passing through the detector will interact and be detected. Relative efficiency values are often used for germanium detectors, and compare the efficiency of the detector at 1332keV to that of a 3in×3in NaI detector (i.e., 1.2×10 −3cps/Bq at 25cm). Relative efficiency values greater than one hundred percent can therefore be encountered when working with very large germanium detectors.|$|E
25|$|Temporal performance: the {{temporal}} resolution of an LCD {{is how well}} it can display changing images, or the accuracy {{and the number of}} times per second the display draws the data it <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>given.</b> LCD pixels do not flash on/off between frames, so LCD monitors exhibit no refresh-induced flicker no matter how low the refresh rate. But a lower refresh rate can mean visual artefacts like ghosting or smearing, especially with fast moving images. Individual pixel response time is also important, as all displays have some inherent latency in displaying an image which can be large enough to create visual artifacts if the displayed image changes rapidly.|$|E
25|$|He {{received}} the most prestigious sacred Vīrasringhala or Veerashringhala (It's a kind of Golden Bracelet, given to the greatest artist/scholar of that era) from Taliparamba Rajarajeshwara Temple (1923).

25|$|Emergency {{vehicles}} are sent on runs {{by a number}} of means. The most common system is by pager, issued to every crew. Pagers may operate on either an analog or a digital system. Analog pagers will silently listen on the air for a 5-tone signal being transmitted. Once the individual signal for that pager is detected, the pager will sound an alarm, and will often open the channel for the crew to hear the dispatcher. Further information <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>given</b> via radio. The digital pagers will listen on a different channel and once its individual address is transmitted, will prepare to receive a data package. This package normally consists of a short message, providing the address and nature of the emergency as well as additional information. This clears the radio channel of lengthy calls. Theoretically, no additional radio traffic is required when using such a system.|$|E
500|$|Moffat {{integrated}} many {{references to}} secondary characters and locations from his previous BAFTA winning show Press Gang into Chalk. For instance, the Chalk character Eric Slatt refers to his neighbouring school Norbridge High, run by Mr Sullivan: {{these were the}} names of the school and deputy headmaster in Press Gang. [...] The scene where Slatt <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>given</b> instructions by wire is taken from the unfilmed Press Gang movie Dead Line. The pornographic video Lesbian Spank Inferno, owned by Dan McGill in the final episode, is later referenced in the Coupling episode [...] "Inferno". In an interview with The New York Times, Moffat admitted that the video is inspired by his then-new partner, Sue Vertue, finding a similar video in their VCR.|$|E

David Benioff began by speaking about Sandor [...] "the Hound" [...] Clegane, saying [...] "I think suffering a near death experience probably changes anyone, and that certainly has changed Sandor Clegane. He's a more thoughtful person than he was when we last saw him, he's probably more aware of his vulnerabilities, he knows how close he came to dying, and he's really thinking about his past in a way that he never had before." [...] Weiss continued, [...] "The unfortunate, ugly reality of the kind of pacifism that Ray is preaching is often suicidal when you're {{in the middle of the}} kind of world that they're all in. Something sad about the fact that this person who tried desperately to walk away from what he was <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>given</b> no real choice but to go full throttle back in the direction of what he really is, which is a killer." ...|$|E
