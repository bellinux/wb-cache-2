On 3 January 1901, she departed Cavite and shaped a course for Hong Kong. The gunboat arrived in that British colony on the 6th and began over six months of repairs. At the completion of that work, she departed Hong Kong on 25 June. After a visit to Shanghai, the warship {{headed back to the}} United States in July and arrived at the Mare Island Navy Yard on 19 August. She was decommissioned there on 5 September 1901.|$|E

25|$|The Imperial County coroner {{determined}} Tanner's time {{of death}} to be sometime between late September 4 and early September 5, but the legal date of death was recorded as September 8, 2008. Tanner's body was found near Clapp Spring with empty water bottles. Tanner had reportedly intended to refill his bottles at the spring before <b>heading</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> provisions at his campsite, but the spring was unexpectedly dry, and Tanner text messaged a friend informing him of this. However, Evan felt {{he could make it}} back to camp if he traveled during the later hours of the evening, refusing offers at that time to send help. Friends were told that if they had not heard from Evan by the next morning and could not reach him by 8am, they then needed to contact Search and Rescue.|$|E
25|$|Outside, Tormund {{moves to}} kill the old man, but Orell tells him to have Jon do it instead to prove his loyalty. Jon is {{ultimately}} unable {{to kill the}} innocent man, and instead Ygritte kills the man with an arrow. Realizing where Jon's loyalties lie, Tormund orders his men to kill him, but Jon manages to defeat them. As Ygritte moves to defend him, Jon deliberately knocks her to the ground, allowing Tormund to hold her down and prevent her from getting killed, while he battles with Orell. Bran enters the mind of Summer, his direwolf, and aids Jon. Jon kills Orell while the wolves hold off the other wildlings, and is then able to steal a horse and escape, leaving Ygritte and <b>heading</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Wall.

25|$|Emma, Hook, Henry, Mary Margaret, David, Regina and Robin are in {{the library}} of the mansion, searching for a way to stop Gold and Isaac from {{enacting}} a new reality with the newly activated ink. They are joined by August, who shows them a drawing of the Sorcerer's Apprentice, who {{might be able to help}} them. Hook remembers the Apprentice from when he and Gold trapped him in the sorcerer's hat. With the help of the Blue Fairy, they release the Apprentice, who immediately says that there’s no time to waste. He tells them that they must find the storybook page depicting the door, as well as the door's key, for only then will they be able to lock Isaac back into the book where he belongs.

25|$|During the Paitilla Airfield operation, another Navy SEAL group, {{consisting}} of four divers and men on Zodiac attack boats, {{was assigned to}} sabotage Noriega's heavily armed gunboat, Presidente Porras, while it was tied to a pier on the canal. The plan called for the divers to plant explosives {{on the bottom of}} the boat, using Draeger rebreathers, which do not give off exhalation bubbles, for added secrecy. The divers were transported by several combat rubber raiding craft to an insertion point located in a grove of mangrove trees roughly one hundred fifty yards away from the target. The divers entered the water and approached the boat in separate pairs, attached the explosives, and began exfiltrating. As they were leaving, several PDF guards began dropping grenades and shooting into the water, forcing the SEALs to take cover under the pier. Due to this diversion, the divers were still in the area when the bombs went off, and were able to confirm that the ship was destroyed. As the divers were <b>heading</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rendezvous point, they heard a large ship approaching overhead, and were forced to descend to forty feet, dangerous due to the increased toxicity of the pure oxygen used in the Draeger at greater pressures. However, no divers experienced any ill effects, and both pairs were picked up by several raiding craft, and were transported back to Rodman Naval Base.|$|E
25|$|Kronprinzessin Cecilie, {{built at}} Stettin, in 1906 by AG Vulcan, {{was the last}} of the four liners built for North German Loyd. She was named after Cecilie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. In July 1907, she was planned to leave Bremerhaven on her maiden voyage. However, before the maiden voyage could take place, she sank in her harbour and did not leave until 14 July. The only one of her sisters not to win the Blue Riband, she was, however, deemed to have had the most {{beautiful}} interiors; Poppe was lead designer, but following a design competition, many of the first class cabins were designed by a group of more modern architects. She was also the largest of the four. At the outbreak of World War I, she was carrying some $10,000,000 in gold and $3,400,000 in silver. <b>Heading</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> neutral United States to avoid capture by the British Navy she was interned at Bar Harbor, Maine, then moved to Boston. Commandeered by the United States Navy on 3 February 1917, she was renamed USS Mount Vernon. She remained under American authority after the armistice of 1918. She made one voyage to Vladivostok through the Panama Canal in order to evacuate refugees and soldiers. Laid up in 1919 with her sister, SS Kaiser Wilhelm II, she was a suggested troop transport for the British in World War II. Deemed too old, she and SS Kaiser Wilhelm II were sold for scrap in 1940 at Baltimore. She was to be the last German liner to have four funnels.|$|E
25|$|Nomad {{is ordered}} to repair {{one of the}} carrier's damaged nuclear reactors. The Nanosuit is {{resistant}} {{to high levels of}} radiation, although prolonged exposure proves deadly. While Nomad is in the reactor room, Helena sends an experimental signal through Nomad's suit that causes several alien machines to absorb too much power and overload, destroying them. As Nomad returns to the flight deck, Admiral Morrison is killed and Nomad takes the prototype TAC-Cannon. On the flight deck, Nomad fights an alien exosuit similar to the one that killed Strickland. A massive alien warship then emerges from the sea, and Helena manages to deactivate its shields by sending a signal through Nomad's Nanosuit. Nomad then uses the TAC-Cannon to destroy the alien warship, which crashes down onto the carrier and begins to sink it. Nomad runs across the flight deck and jumps off the carrier into the waiting VTOL, which is piloted by Psycho. As they fly away, Helena is nearly pulled out of the aircraft by the energy field created by the destroyed alien warship. The ship drags the Constitution beneath the surface and vaporizes, creating a massive vortex that engulfs and destroys the entire carrier fleet. Psycho then receives a transmission that there is another carrier strike group en route to the island and suggests meeting them. Nomad protests, claiming that since they now know how to defeat the aliens, they need to continue fighting. A transmission from Prophet, who is inside the energy field on the island, is then received. The VTOL is then seen turning around and <b>heading</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island.|$|E

500|$|Soon {{after signing}} his contract, the Royals {{assigned}} Hosmer, #30 at the time, to the Idaho Falls Chukars of the rookie level Pioneer League in minor league baseball. [...] Before {{reporting to the}} Chukars, Royals general manager Moore told reporters that Hosmer would not be [...] "rushed" [...] to reach the Majors, stating {{that he needs to}} advance though the Minor League hierarchy in his [...] "own natural pace". He played a handful of games with the Chukars before a contract dispute with another Boras client, Pittsburgh Pirates second overall pick Pedro Alvarez delayed Hosmer from playing with the team. Boras had claimed that Alvarez signed his contract after the August 15 deadline had passed, thus won't report to the Pirates. The Major League Baseball Players Association filed a grievance stating that Hosmer's contract was also signed past the deadline and that Major League Baseball extended the August 15 deadline without the association's permission. Both sides settled the claim a month later, allowing Hosmer and Alvarez to join their respective teams. Hosmer never disputed his original contract. Instead of <b>heading</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Chukars, Hosmer was sent to the Arizona Fall League to train.|$|E
500|$|After the {{commercial}} lackluster of her eighth studio album, Britney Jean (2013), Spears started her Las Vegas residency show, , which attained commercial success. Later, in September 2014, the singer posted {{a picture of}} herself in a recording studio, hinting that she was recording new music. In an interview with Extra, a month later, she revealed that she was working [...] "very slowly, but progressively" [...] on a studio album. She also released the song [...] "Pretty Girls" [...] in 2015 with Iggy Azalea, which was met with moderate impact. This resulted in Spears <b>heading</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> studio to record more songs without having plans to release a new album. In late 2016, during interviews to promote Glory, Spears declared {{that she wanted to}} explore new things on the record, and that it was her [...] "most hip-hop album," [...] explaining, [...] " [...] there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I've wanted to do for a long time now, and I just haven't really done that." [...] Talay Riley, who was among the songwriters that worked with Spears on the album, previously co-wrote Iggy Azalea's [...] "Bounce" [...] (2013) and Nick Jonas' [...] "Levels" [...] (2015). After the release of first single [...] "Make Me..." [...] and the promotional single [...] "Private Show" [...] on August 8, 2016, Spears and website PopCrush announced that [...] "Clumsy" [...] was going to be made available as the second promotional track from the Glory as an instant grant for those who pre-ordered the album.

It hit a line of small craters in the sand and began to turn to starboard, careering towards Klemantaski, who, viewing events through a telescopic lens, misjudged the distance and continued filming. Hearing the approaching roar he looked up from his viewfinder to see Panjandrum, shedding live rockets in all directions, heading straight for him. As he ran for his life, he glimpsed the assembled admirals and generals diving for cover behind the pebble ridge into barbed-wire entanglements.

Chief American Horse’s camp was a rich prize. “It was the season when the wild plums ripen.

[...] Barry Nicolson of NME commented, [...] "Once the source of pop inspiration, now it seems they're content to follow", concluding that the album is [...] "basically an upbeat electro-pop record with one foot in the '80s, much like roughly 85 per cent of music made in the last two years." [...] Kitty Empire of The Observer agreed, stating, [...] "Having pre-empted the wave of womanly electro, they appear now to be behind rather than ahead of the curve", while calling the album [...] "decent but unsurprising".|$|E
