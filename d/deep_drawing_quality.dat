Detailed macroscopic strain measurements were made at different cup depths. These were simulated using PAM-STAMP, a commercial finite element-based software.

These were kept either constant or dynamically varied during the simulation. The constant properties were taken from conventional tensile tests of the original material, while the dynamic variation in properties was extrapolated from developments in the crystallographic texture and in-grain misorientation. Considering dynamic properties during simulation provided a superior prediction of macroscopic strains. This study clearly demonstrates the need for considering evolution of critical continuum properties, such as work hardening and anisotropy index, through appropriate microstructural inputs for more realistic macroscopic predictions...|$|R

40|$|The {{addition}} of microalloying {{elements such as}} Ti and Nb to increase the strength of <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>quality</b> steels for automotive sheet products might affect the microstructure formed during the annealing after warm rolling in several ways. Firstly, the precipitates can exert a Zener's pinning on growing recrystallized grain, {{which leads to a}} sluggish recrystallization kinetics. Secondly, the amount of microalloying elements control the amount of C, N, S, and P in solid solution, which indirectly affects the recrystallization texture obtained after annealing. In this sense, the work carried out with three different interstitial free (IF) and interstitial free high-strength (IFHS) steel grades allows us to conclude that the increase of microalloying additions delays recrystallization kinetics. Moreover, the abrupt texture change observed between as-rolled and annealed material indicates that the nucleation mechanism for recrystallization is more related to classical nucleation at deformed grain boundaries than subgrain rotation (continuous nucleation). © 2010 The Japan Institute of Metals.

40|$|The present paper evaluates two phenomenological {{plasticity}} models {{which account}} for the influence of strain-path change (SPC) on the stress-strain behavior. The HAH model (Barlat et al., 2014) is modified to capture SPC transients observed in aluminum, i. e., hardening stagnation after reverse SPCs and permanent softening after orthogonal SPCs. Predictions by the HAH model are compared to the MHH model (Mánik et al., 2015), which was originally developed for aluminum.

The MHH model predicts the stress-strain behavior after single SPCs slightly better than the HAH model for both aluminum and steel.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experimental and numerical results of rectangular cup {{drawing of steel}} sheets. The aim of the experimental study was to analyze material behavior under deformation. The received results were further used to verify the results from numerical simulation by taking friction and material anisotropy into consideration. A 3 D parametric finite element (FE) model was built using the FE-package ABAQUS/Standard. ABAQUS allows analyzing physical models of real processes putting special emphasis on geometrical non-linearities caused by large deformations, material non-linearities and complex friction conditions. Frictional properties of the <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>quality</b> steel sheet were determined by using the pin-on-disc tribometer. It shows that the friction coefficient value depends on the measured angle from the rolling direction and corresponds to the surface topography. A quadratic Hill anisotropic yield criterion was compared with Huber-Mises yield criterion having isotropic hardening. Plastic anisotropy {{is the result of}} the distortion of the yield surface shape due to the material microstructural state. The sensitivity of constitutive laws to the initial data characterizing material behavior isalso presented. It is found that plastic anisotropy of the matrix in ductile sheet metal has influence on deformation behavior of the material. If the material and friction anisotropy are taken into account in the finite element analysis, this approach undoubtedly gives the most approximate numerical results to real processes. This paper is the first part of the study of numerical investigation using ABAQUS and mainly deals with the most influencing parameters in a forming process to simulate the sheet metal forming of rectangular cup...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} a {{methodology}} to investigate <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>quality</b> steel sheets deformation tendency under multiaxial deep drawing stresses has been proposed.

40|$|The {{requirement}} for {{high quality steel}} especially high steel cleanliness has increased in recent years due to the rapid development of new technologies such as thin strip casting and new products such as ultra low carbon steel for <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>quality,</b> which require high steel cleanliness. This {{has led to the}} development of the role of the tundish to enhance the removal of inclusions from steel. Two mathematical models have been developed to investigate the effect of various operating parameters on the removal efficiency of inclusions in a tundish. The first model was applied to predict the removal efficiency of the particle in a tundish without gas injection. Both models assumed that the fluid flow in the tundish consists of three regions; plug flow, mixed flow and dead flow region. In the plug flow region of flrst model, it was assumed that the removal efficiency of the particle was governed by Stoke rising velocity. The removal of partide in the mixed flow region was assunried to follow the kinetics of the flrst-order law. The dead region was not involved in the partide transfer process. The second model was devebped to predwt the rennoval effidency of particles in a tundish bubbled by gas. The transfer process of partk^le in the plug and dead flow region were assumed similar to the first model. In the mixing region, it was assumed that the removal of particles mainly occurs due to the adhesion of indusion to bubbles. The flotation rate of the partide therefore was assumed to be governed by collision efficiency between particles and bubbles. Cold model experiments were carried out to validate the proposed mathematical models. It was found that, the results from the first mathematical model were in good agreement with the results obtained from cold model experiments for a tundish without gas injection. Both mathematical and cold model experimental results showed that the efficiencies of particle removal in a tundish slightly increased with increasing fluid depth and decreased with increasing casting rate. It was also found that the removal efficiency of the particles was greatly dependent on the particle size. As predicted by the mathematicat model for removal of particles in a tundish bubbled by gas, the renrwival efficiency of partides in tfie tundish increased with increasing gas flow rates injected in tundish. Cold nrKXiel experiments showed the similar pattern wifri this mathematical prediction.

In this paper, {{mechanical}} properties of unidirectional hot tensile tests of 3 mm thick AZ 31 magnesium alloy sheet metal are researched at elevated temperatures and under different tensile speeds. In this basis, thermal <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> of cylinders tests for 3 mm thick AZ 31 magnesium alloy sheet are investigated at elevated drawing temperatures, different drawing speeds and so on. Thermal <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> performance showed that set pieces better when elevated temperature and drawing speed range are appropriate to <b>deep</b> <b>drawing...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is {{investigation}} of steel X 5 CrNiMo 17 - 12 - 2 in a <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> process. Material and mechanical properties are investigated in order to obtain a number of parameters that are needed for the <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> process. Tolerances for final product dimensions were taken and a procedure for <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> process was calculated. Tooling was modelled with Solidworks software. Experiments were performed in order to determine functionality of tooling, feasibility and influential factors on process uncertainties...|$|R
