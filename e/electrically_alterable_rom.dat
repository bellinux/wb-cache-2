50|$|GI Microelectronics was a {{manufacturer}} of LSI circuits and a pioneer in MOS technology and <b>Electrically</b> <b>Alterable</b> <b>ROM</b> (EAROM), with both off-the-shelf and custom circuits. GI spun the division off as Microchip Technology in 1987.|$|E
50|$|Later, in the 1970s and 1980s, SSDs were {{implemented}} in semiconductor memory for early supercomputers of IBM, Amdahl, and Cray, {{but they were}} seldom used because of their prohibitively high price. In the late 1970s, General Instruments produced an <b>electrically</b> <b>alterable</b> <b>ROM</b> (EAROM) which operated somewhat like the later NAND flash memory. Unfortunately, a ten-year life was not achievable and many companies abandoned the technology. In 1976, Dataram started selling a product called Bulk Core, which provided up to 2 MB of solid state storage compatible with Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) and Data General (DG) computers. In 1978, Texas Memory Systems introduced a 16 kilobyte RAM solid-state drive {{to be used by}} oil companies for seismic data acquisition. The following year, StorageTek developed the first RAM solid-state drive.|$|E
40|$|A {{holographic}} recording medium comprising a conductive substrate, a photoconductive layer and an <b>electrically</b> <b>alterable</b> layer of a linear, {{low molecular weight}} hydrocarbon polymer has improved fatigue resistance. An acrylic barrier layer can be interposed between the photoconductive and <b>electrically</b> <b>alterable</b> layers...|$|R
40|$|A fully integrated, <b>electrically</b> <b>alterable,</b> nonvolatile, {{nondestructive}} readout control memory was developed, using as storage elements metal-nitride-silicon variable threshold transistors. An optimum approach {{to such a}} memory was developed in which a three dimensional selection technique was used, both for read and write operations. Electrical isolation of writing and memory circuits was obtained by means of separate memory and write circuit chips. This method provided protection from voltage breakdowns, increased circuit flexibility, and greater ease of testing of interim and final circuit elements...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Electrically</b> <b>alterable</b> {{read-only}} memory (EAROM) {{is a type}} of EEPROM that can be modified one bit at a time. Writing is a very slow process and again needs higher voltage (usually around 12 V) than is used for read access. EAROMs are intended for applications that require infrequent and only partial rewriting. EAROM may be used as non-volatile storage for critical system setup information; in many applications, EAROM has been supplanted by CMOS RAM supplied by mains power and backed-up with a lithium battery.|$|R

Serial in/Serial out (SI/SO) blocks provide time base translation <b>electrically</b> <b>alterable</b> delay, and sequential TDM filters, Parallel In/Serial Out blocks are useful in time divisions multiplexing (TDM) and Serial In/Parallel Out blocks for variable tapped delay lines, filters and correlators. Combinations of the above linear or one-dimensional blocks provides two-dimensional arrays for filter banks, multiple correlators, etc. Particular telemetry applications are FM filters, Parallel Correlators, Matched Filters, Single Sideband Modulators and Adaptive line equalizers...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a technology for building <b>electrically</b> <b>alterable</b> read only memories (EAROMs) or reprogrammable read only memories (RPROMs) using a single level metal gate p channel MOS process with all conventional processing steps is outlined. Nonvolatile storage of data is achieved {{by the use of}} charged floating gate electrodes. The floating gates are charged by avalanche injection of hot electrodes through gate oxide, and discharged by avalanche injection of hot holes through gate oxide. Three extra diffusion and patterning steps are all that is required to convert a standard p channel MOS process into a nonvolatile memory process. For identification, this nonvolatile memory technology was given the descriptive acronym DIFMOS which stands for Dual Injector, Floating gate MOS...|$|R
40|$|<b>Electrically</b> <b>alterable</b> {{read-only}} memories (EAROM's) or reprogrammable read-only memories (RPROM's) can be fabricated using a single-level metal-gate p-channel MOS {{technology with}} all conventional processing steps. Given the acronym DIFMOS for dual-injector floating-gate MOS, this technology utilizes the floating-gate technique for nonvolatile storage of data. Avalanche injection of hot electrons through gate oxide from a special injector diode in each bit {{is used to}} charge the floating gates. A second injector structure included in each bit permits discharge of the floating gate by avalanche injection of holes through gate oxide. The overall design of the DIFMOS bit is dictated by the physical considerations required {{for each of the}} avalanche injector types. The end result is a circuit technology which can provide fully decoded bit-erasable EAROM-type circuits using conventional manufacturing techniques...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 A {{non-volatile}} <b>electrically</b> <b>alterable</b> {{read-only memory}} using an MOS {{field effect transistor}} with a threshold voltage which depended upon the position of ionic charges for its memory was fabricated. The conventional silicon dioxide layer {{was replaced by a}} composite layer consisting of thermal silicon dioxide, electron beam evaporated aluminum oxide, and pyrolytically deposited silicon dioxide which substantially reduced the migration rate of the ions. The rate of drift of the ions was found to be dependent upon the polarity of the electric field. The ions had greater mobility under a negative applied bias. It was also shown that for the same electric fields the activation energy was higher for negative electric fields, and that the activation energy decreases with increasing electric fields. The migration rate was also found to be an exponential function of applied electric field...|$|R
40|$|A {{reconfigurable}} telemetry multiplexer {{is described}} {{which includes a}} monitor-terminal and a plurality of remote terminals. The remote terminals each include signal conditioning for a plurality of sensors for measuring parameters which are converted by an analog to digital converter. CPU's in the remote terminals store instructions for prompting system configuration and reconfiguration commands. The measurements, instructions, and the terminal's present configuration and status data are transmitted to the monitor-terminal and displayed. In response to menu-driven prompts generated and displayed at the monitor-terminal, data generation request commands, status and health commands, and the like are input at the monitor-terminal and transmitted to the remote terminals. The CPU in each remote terminal receives the various commands, stores them in <b>electrically</b> <b>alterable</b> memory, and reacts {{in accordance with the}} commands to reconfigure a plurality of aspects of the system. The CPU in each terminal also generates parameter measurements, status and health signals, and transmits these signals of the respective terminals to the monitor-terminal for low data rate operator viewing and to higher rate external transmission/monitor equipment. Reconfiguration may be in real time during the general period of parameter measurement acquisition, and may include alteration of the gain, automatic gain rescaling, bias, and or sampling rates associated with {{one or more of the}} parameter measurements made by the remote terminals...|$|R
