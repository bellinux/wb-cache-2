Scott said, [...] "We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> everybody's needs but we've {{got to get}} our state back to work," [...] and also encouraged tourists {{to return to the}} state, especially in Key West, where hotel owners were considering cancelling reservations for Labor Day. A Florida state fund known as Neighbors to the Rescue [...] with the purpose of distributing money to help recovery efforts for victims of Isaac [...] was activated by the governor. The area already qualified for small business loans due to a state of emergency and after the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reviewed damage assessments, President of the United States Barack Obama considered a disaster declaration. Initially, FEMA denied a disaster declaration. In response, Governor Scott mailed a letter of appeal to FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate. The appeal was accepted, and on October18, 2012, President Obama issued a disaster declaration for Bay, Collier, Escambia, Franklin, Gulf, Martin, Monroe, Okaloosa, Palm Beach, St. Lucie, and Santa Rosa counties.|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} with MTV News in November 2009, Clarkson stated that while performing on the All I Ever Wanted Tour, she would also be {{in the process of}} writing new material for her fifth studio album, which she hoped for a late 2010 release. Later, during the Chart Show TV, Clarkson revealed that she wanted to do something different for the album. Her label felt the same way. On March 4, 2010, Clarkson was announced to perform on the revived Lilith Fair music festival. However, low ticket sales and scheduling conflicts led Clarkson and Norah Jones to cancel their upcoming performances. Clarkson remarked she would focus on recording for her upcoming album instead. Clarkson took a six-month break from her music career in 2010. Clarkson, who had a hectic schedule following the release of her sophomore album Breakaway, admitted that her music career had a bad effect on her health, saying [...] "Because my career went from zero to 100, there was no 'growing'. I learnt well under pressure, but, like, four years passed by and I hit rock bottom, Breakaway just exploded everywhere. Everyone was making a lot of money, so everyone was pushing the train. That's when it finally all caught up with me. I came down with 'walking pneumonia' {{for the second time in}} a year. My body was physically giving up. I took six months off and went home. I love working, but at the end of the day you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> yourself." ...|$|E

I want a man as is always a-sliding off his legs when he ought to be on 'em. I want a man as is so low down in the school of life that he's always a-making figures of one in his copy-book, and can't get no further. I want a man as is his own great coat and cloak, and is always a-wrapping himself up in himself. And I have got him too,' said Mr Tapley, after a moment's silence. 'What a happiness!' ...|$|R

50|$|According to the Arizona Department of Health Services, Herb Jepko {{was born}} in Hayden, Colorado to a single mother named Mary Irene Parke. http://genealogy.az.gov/ He was {{originally}} named William, {{but when he was}} adopted by Metro and Nellie Jepko of Prescott, Arizona, they renamed him Herbert Earl Jepko. Metro and Nellie's marriage was not a happy one. After they divorced, Metro got custody, but he was a wounded World War I veteran, and he soon took ill. With his father unable to care for him, Herb had to spend time in foster care off and on. He attended school in Prescott, but then his father <b>got</b> healthy enough <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of him again, and in 1949, they moved to Phoenix. Herb graduated high school there, and briefly attended Phoenix College, which was then a small two-year college and is today flagship of the Maricopa Community College system. http://www.maricopa.edu/ He hoped to become a doctor, but soon ran out of money and was drafted into the Army. (1) It was during his time in the military that he discovered his life's work—radio, working in Radio-Television Operations while serving in the Korean War.|$|R

500|$|Baleen whales {{have rarely}} been kept in captivity. Their large size and {{appetite}} make them expensive creatures to maintain.

The second gray whale, which was captured in 1971 from the same lagoon, was named Gigi II and was released a year later after becoming too big.

5000|$|If Savatage {{would have}} {{released}} Dead Winter Dead and it sold 2 million records, we wouldn't be having this conversation right now. Somebody else {{explain to me}} how I could release the same song {{the next year and}} it sell millions. And then I walk around and I've got 6 platinum records on my wall, and not one of them says Savatage on it, folks. So what am I supposed <b>to</b> do? I've <b>got</b> a family <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of. I've <b>got</b> responsibilities. I gave it as much time as I could to break. Now I have something that's become very successful. It's paid the bills for everybody, it's provided a living for all the guys from Savatage. We're still a family, we're still together, we still love each other. Why would I want to do anything to destroy that? Why would I want to put a monkey wrench in that to rehearse a week and go put a Savatage thing together? It doesn't make any sense to me. Now I'm up for maybe doing some recordings, maybe put together a 4-song or 5-song EP or something, but I can't shut down what provides a living for so many people, the Savatage guys mostly. It just doesn't make any sense to me. I think a lot of times Chris (Caffery) and Johnny and those guys just miss those days, and believe me, I miss them, too. I miss them probably more than any of them do. Johnny and Chris have been around for a while, but I was there for ten years before Johnny and Chris Caffery were around. So if anyone understands it, I do understand, but we just don't have the time to do both. That's why we had to make that decision - {{is it going to be}} Savatage, is it going to be TSO? The numbers don't lie. You can't fight the numbers. TSO sells out 40,000 tickets a day. I've done whole tours with Savatage in America where we didn't play in front of 40,000 people in 6 weeks, and people still argue with me about it. It drives me crazy. I'm like, 'I don't get it. I don't get it, guys. I don't get it.' I understand, but Savatage was a great band, and I want it to live on its legacy. I don't want to just slap something together real quick and cheapen the name. If I was ever going to do that, it would have to be big, at the level of TSO, the production and everything. I'm not just going to slap it together. That wouldn't be right, and I don't think it's necessary. Maybe we'll do some recording, though, maybe do an EP and put it out as a special thing.|$|R
