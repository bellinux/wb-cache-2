Three lugers, {{including}} Kumaritashvili's teammate Levan Gureshidze, {{did not participate in}} any training runs on that day. Gureshidze decided to <b>fly</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Georgia to mourn the loss of his teammate, and the athletes who participated all wore a black stripe on their helmets in honour of Kumaritashvili.|$|E
5|$|Fruit eating, or frugivory, {{is found}} in both major suborders. Bats prefer ripe fruit, pulling it off the trees with their teeth. They <b>fly</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> their roosts to eat the fruit, sucking out the juice and {{spitting}} the seeds and pulp out onto the ground. This helps disperse the seeds of these fruit trees, which may take root and grow where the bats have left them, and numerous species of plants depend on bats for seed dispersal. The Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) has been recorded carrying fruits weighing 3–14g (0.11–0.49oz) or even as much as 50g (1.8oz).|$|E
5|$|In February 1974, the British Prime Minister, Edward Heath, {{advised the}} Queen {{to call a}} general {{election}} {{in the middle of}} her tour of the Austronesian Pacific Rim, requiring her to <b>fly</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Britain. The election resulted in a hung parliament; Heath's Conservatives were not the largest party, but could stay in office if they formed a coalition with the Liberals. Heath only resigned when discussions on forming a coalition foundered, after which the Queen asked the Leader of the Opposition, Labour's Harold Wilson, to form a government.|$|E

5|$|Vissi's music rival Despina Vandi {{also became}} less prominent. While the {{supposed}} rivalry {{between the two}} was once a grand topic in the media, with speculation as to who would come out on top, the possible overexposure {{of the story and}} their subsequent absences allowed fellow laïko-pop singer Elena Paparizou, fresh off of the momentum of her 2005 Eurovision win, to ultimately overshadow the two {{during the second half of}} the decade. While reviewing Apagorevmeno, Haris Simvoulidis of Avopolis felt that Vissi appeared to be attempting to catch up to her contemporaries, Paparizou and Peggy Zina. Vissi continued to make music and soon managed to <b>fly</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the top as her follow-up album Apagorevmeno becaume the biggest selling album by a female artist for 2009 and her shows continue to be sold out even today. She was also placed 15th in Forbes list of the most powerful and influential Greece celebrities in 2010. Her time on hiatus in the late 2000s was filmed and used for a reality show called Oso Eho Foni in 2011.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{invasion}} of Norway by Nazi Germany on 9 April 1940, German Luftwaffe-aircraft landed at Fornebu. There was no attempt by the civilian airport authorities to hinder this, such as driving cars onto the runway, although several German aircraft collided with each other during the landing. A KLM aircraft had a scheduled service that morning, and the captain was ordered to leave the passengers, take the crew and return to Oslo. On 12 April, the airport was bombed by the British Royal Air Force. On 14 April, the KLM captain was granted permission to <b>fly</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Amsterdam with the crew, albeit without any passengers. The German military used Fornebu heavily during the war, {{but it was never}} of any strategic importance, since it was located far from any battle zones. During the war, the airport officially remained owned by the municipality. By orders of the German authorities, the main north–south runway was expanded to , and all facilities not yet built were completed. However, during the war all other runways than the main north–south were taken out of use. At {{the north end of the}} runway, the Luftwaffe built several hangars and a prison camp. Prisoners were used to keep the runways free of snow during winter, by marching along them and stomping the snow down.|$|E

5|$|On the field, the Australians—captained by Richie Benaud—were successful. They {{defeated}} Pakistan 2–0 {{in three}} Tests, and India 2–1 over five matches. Australia’s only other Test win on Pakistani soil came in 1998 {{and they have}} only won two series in India since the Benaud-Loxton expedition. They also remained unbeaten outside the Test matches. Despite the success with bat and ball, the Australians were struck down by serious illness during {{the second part of}} their tour in India, despite taking Dr. Ian McDonald—a former Victorian first-class cricketer—with the travelling party. Gordon Rorke, Lindsay Kline and Gavin Stevens all contracted hepatitis; the former two were sent home, while the latter was too ill to <b>fly</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Australia {{until the end of the}} tour. Harvey said that Stevens—who never played first-class cricket again after his illness—"could've been the first man to die on tour". Due to the bevy of unfit players, Loxton was forced to line up in one game, against Indian Universities in Bangalore, two years after playing his last first-class match. He scored 33 and bowled six overs without taking a wicket in a high-scoring draw.|$|E
5|$|She is then tasked {{to escort}} Dr. Otto Schenker, an East German scientist, to England. Later on, as Cate and Dr. Schenker <b>fly</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> England, he is {{captured}} by H.A.R.M., led by Magnus Armstrong, who knocks Cate unconscious. Armstrong decides to spare Cate's life, believing {{that she is}} a fellow Scot. Cate awakens and is soon thrown from the plane as it explodes. After surviving the fall via parachute, Cate is later introduced to a new partner, Tom Goodman, a UNITY agent from the American branch. After meeting him in a nightclub in Hamburg, they are ambushed by H.A.R.M. but manage to escape. The nightclub is owned by a German singer named Inge Wagner, whom Cate suspects is connected with H.A.R.M. The two are then tasked to investigate a cargo freighter containing several suspicious chemical containers that UNITY believes are linked to Dr. Schenker. Cate gets in the freighter, and after taking photos of the containers, is knocked unconscious by Armstrong, who spares her life by locking her in a cargo hold, thus ignoring Wagner's insistence that she must be liquidated. As the freighter heads out to sea, it slowly begins to sink, due to a huge explosion. Wagner and Armstrong escape immediately, but Cate has to fight her way out of the bowels of the freighter. Because Cate could not obtain the required information, she and Tom must return to the sunken freighter to finish gathering intelligence aboard. Cate goes scuba diving, and after investigating the shipwreck and obtaining the captain's log and the cargo manifest, she is ambushed by H.A.R.M. divers sent from a submarine commanded by Armstrong and Wagner but manages to escape.|$|E

25|$|Aviation safety author Andrew Brookes {{wrote that}} the true cause will never be known, but that pilot error induced by fatigue {{is likely to have}} played a part; the crew had been on flight duty for 9 hours and 15 minutes, {{including}} 6 hours flying time, before they took off on the crash flight. Had they made it to Fort George, they would have needed special permission from a senior officer to <b>fly</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Aldergrove.|$|E
25|$|In February 2010, another serious {{incident}} involving a B-2 occurred at Andersen AFB. The aircraft involved was AV-11 Spirit of Washington.
