5|$|EU {{legislation}} {{makes no}} provision for the preservation and protection of breed types, which, {{in the case of}} Limousins, have been maintained and the breed developed through a rigorously enforced breed standard for over a century.

Current EU legislation with its focus on free trade thus has the potential to result in the dilution of purebred breeds and loss of efficiency gains arising from crossbreeding.|$|E

5|$|K'ak' Joplaj Chan K'awiil was {{installed}} as the 14th dynastic ruler of Copán on 7June 738, 39days after {{the execution of}} Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil. Little is known of his reign {{due to the lack}} of monuments raised after Quiriguá's surprise victory. Copán's defeat had wider implications due to the fracturing of the city's domain and the loss of the key Motagua River trade route to Quiriguá. The fall in Copán's income and corresponding increase at Quiriguá is evident from the massive commissioning of new monuments and architecture at the latter city, and Copán may even <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>subject</b> to its former vassal.

This unexpected defeat resulted in a 17-year hiatus at the city, during which time Copán may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>subject</b> to Quiriguá in a reversal of fortunes.|$|E
