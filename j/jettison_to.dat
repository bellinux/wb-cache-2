40|$|Using ascent {{trajectory}} {{data provided}} by the contractor, nominal drag impact locations for the launch vehicle jettisoned bodies were determined by trajectory simulation. The solid motor casings, spent core stage, and payload fairing for each Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) configuration were assumed to have similar aerodynamic characteristics as current launch vehicle jettisoned bodies that have similar length to diameter ratios. Thus, tumbling drag coefficients that are used for current launch vehicle range safety analyses (References [1]&[2]) were applied to EELV jettisoned bodies with the appropriate scaling of the aerodynamic reference area and using appropriate jettisoned weights. Separate 3 -degree-of-freedom simulations from <b>jettison</b> <b>to</b> surface impact were executed for the Atlas V solid rocket motors (SRMs), the Delta IV solid rocket motors (graphite epoxy motors or GEM 60 s), the payload fairings (PLF), and the expended first stages (Stage 1). Note that separation velocities were not modeled. For solid strap-ons and the fairing, the separation velocity is generally of small magnitude and in a lateral direction. Therefore, {{it would have a}} very small effect on the calculated impact location. The velocity imparted to the spent core stage could be significant and in the aft direction. If so, the expected impact location would shift uprange by about 10 to 20 nautical miles.

50|$|Unlike {{traditional}} hot-air balloons, where {{a single}} large balloon {{is equipped with}} vents enabling altitude control, cluster balloons are multiple, small, readily available and individually sealed balloons.

50|$|Four {{ballast tanks}} (or bladders, {{as he called}} them) were {{installed}} in the free-flooding area between the submarine's two hulls, two located forward and two towards the rear, all controlled from inside the pressure hull using valves to admit water and pumps to force in air.

50|$|Traditionally, weight belts or weight {{systems are}} worn with the weights on, or close to, {{the waist and}} are {{arranged}} with a quick release mechanism to allow them <b>to</b> be quickly <b>jettisoned</b> <b>to</b> provide extra buoyancy in an emergency.
