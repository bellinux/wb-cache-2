50|$|Many other sex-determination systems exist. In {{some species}} of reptiles, {{including}} alligators, some turtles, and the tuatara, sex {{is determined by}} the temperature at which the egg is incubated during a temperature-sensitive period. There are no examples of temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) in birds. Megapodes had formerly been thought to exhibit this phenomenon, but were found to actually have different temperature-dependent embryo mortality rates for each sex. For some species with TSD, sex determination is achieved by exposure to hotter temperatures resulting in the offspring being one sex and cooler temperatures resulting in the other. This type of TSD is called Pattern I. For others species using TSD, it is exposure to temperatures on both extremes that results in offspring of one sex, and exposure to moderate temperatures that results in offspring of the opposite sex, called Pattern II TSD. The specific temperatures required to produce each sex are known as the female-promoting temperature and the male-promoting temperature. When the temperature stays near the threshold during the temperature sensitive period, the sex ratio is varied between the two sexes. Some species' temperature standards are based on when a particular enzyme is created. These species that rely upon temperature for their sex determination do not have the SRY gene, but have other genes such as DAX1, DMRT1, and SOX9 that are expressed or not expressed depending on the temperature. The sex of some species, such as the Nile tilapia, Australian skink lizard, and Australian <b>dragon</b> <b>lizard,</b> is initially determined by chromosomes, but can later be changed by the temperature of incubation.|$|E
40|$|Background: Polymorphism {{within the}} same species, population, and sex is an {{interesting}} problem for the evolutionary biologist, since differences in fitness between the morphs have to cancel out over evolutionary time, otherwise morphs of lower fitness would become extinct. One way this may be achieved is through the adoption of different morph-specific reproductive strategies, allowing morphs to become conditional specialists in space (co-existing) or in time (and cycle in frequency). In either case, we expect selection to be disruptive on data pooled across morphs. Question: In the annual Australian painted <b>dragon</b> <b>lizard</b> (Ctenophorus pictus; less than 10...|$|E
50|$|In {{support of}} the Charnov and Bull hypothesis, Warner and Shine (2008) showed {{confidently}} that incubation temperature influences males’ reproductive success differently than females in Jacky <b>Dragon</b> <b>lizards</b> (Amphibolurus muricatus) by treating the eggs with chemicals that interfere with steroid hormone biosynthesis. These chemicals block the conversion of testosterone to oestradiol during development so each sex offspring can be produced at all temperatures. They found that hatching temperatures that naturally produce each sex maximized fitness of each sex, which provides the substantial empirical evidence in {{support of the}} Charnov & Bull model for reptiles.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{eradication}} of dingos {{and the establishment of}} permanent waterholes for stock, the numbers of red kangaroos, western grey kangaroos and euros in the Flinders Ranges have increased. The yellow-footed rock-wallaby, which neared extinction after the arrival of Europeans due to hunting and predation by foxes, has now stabilized. Other endemic marsupials include dunnarts, planigales. Echidnas are the sole monotreme species in the park. Insectivorous bats make up significant proportion of mammals in the area. Reptiles include goannas, snakes, <b>dragon</b> <b>lizards,</b> skinks and geckos. The streambank froglet is an endemic amphibian.|$|R
25|$|There {{are more}} than 700 species of lizards in Australia with representatives of five families. There are over 130 species in 20 genera of gecko found {{throughout}} the Australian continent. The Pygopodidae is a family of limbless lizards endemic to the Australian region; all 39 species from seven genera occur in Australia. The Agamidae or <b>dragon</b> <b>lizards</b> are represented by 70 species in 14 genera, including the thorny devil, bearded <b>dragon</b> and frill-necked <b>lizard.</b> There are 30 species of monitor lizard, family Varanidae, in Australia, where they {{are commonly known as}} goannas. The largest Australian monitor is the perentie, which can reach up to 2m in length. There are about 450 species of skink from more than 40 genera, comprising more than 50% of the total Australian lizard fauna; this group includes the blue-tongued lizards.|$|R
40|$|Telomeres shorten as a {{consequence}} of DNA replication, in particular in cells with low production of telomerase and perhaps in response to physiological stress from exposure to reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide. This process of telomere attrition is countered by innate antioxidation, such as via the production of superoxide dismutase. We studied the inheritance of telomere length in the Australian painted <b>dragon</b> <b>lizard</b> (Ctenophorus pictus) {{and the extent to which}} telomere length covaries with masscorrected maternal reproductive investment, which reflects the level of circulating yolk precursor and antioxidant, vitellogenin. Our predictors of offspring telomere length explained 72 % of telomere variation (including interstitial telomeres if such are present). Maternal telomere length and reproductive investment were positively influencing offspring telomere length in our analyses, whereas flow cytometry-estimated superoxide level was negatively impacting offspring telomere length. We suggest that the effects of superoxide on hatchling telomere shortening may be partly balanced by transgenerational effects of vitellogenin antioxidation...|$|E
40|$|In the Australian painted <b>dragon</b> <b>lizard</b> (Ctenophorus pictus), males {{occur in}} two {{different}} morphs with respect to gular color, {{with or without a}} yellow bib. Males without a bib lost within-clutch paternity significantly more often to rivals than bibbed males. Thus, it appears that bibs identify some phenotypic advantage linked to competitive ability. To test whether this could be related to whole-organism capacity to withstand an increased workload (due to better health and vigor, or evolved differences in self-maintenance), we implanted males with a lead pellet (loaded), Styrofoam pellet (controls), or sham-operated males without implants (shams), and compared male categories with respect to how they maintained body mass during the mating season. Somewhat unexpectedly, bibbed males consistently lost more body weight across all treatments and controls, although we could not verify that this translated into higher mortality in this short-lived animal (about 80 % survive for one year only). However, bibbed males may invest more into "mating success" than nonbibbed males, which agrees with our experimental results and paternity data...|$|E
40|$|Recent work on within-species {{polymorphism}} {{across a}} broad range of taxa has renewed and considerably increased the attention to this classic evolutionary area, notably in lizard species where colors covary with reproductive strategies. We demonstrate elsewhere that red-headed males beat yellow-headed males in staged contests for females in the Australian painted <b>dragon</b> <b>lizard</b> Ctenophorus pictus. This morph difference in behaviour is linked to {{what appears to be a}} convention of red dominance in male–male interactions set very early in ontogeny, long before coloration has developed. In the current note, we investigate the relationship between time of day, which is directly linked to vigilance time in territorial males, and plasma levels of testosterone and corticosterone. We show that red males have higher testosterone levels in late afternoon following a day of territory patrolling and a non-significant trend in plasma corticosterone levels that decline with time of day. In conclusion, there are significant differences in testosterone profile between the two color morphs, providing a potential proximate link to the behavioural differences between them. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Variation in {{exposure}} to sex hormones during early development contributes to phenotypic plasticity in vertebrate offspring. As a proposed marker for prenatal sex hormone exposure {{and because of}} their association with various physiological and behavioral characteristics, digit ratio and/or digit length have received notable interest {{within the field of}} evolutionary ecology. However, the validity of digit measures as a proxy of prenatal sex hormone exposure is controversial and only few studies have provided direct evidence for the link between digit development and prenatal sex hormones. Here, we report morph- and sex-specific variation in digit ratio in wild painted <b>dragon</b> <b>lizards</b> (Ctenophorus pictus). Lizards expressing a yellow bib have significantly larger third-to-fourth toe ratios (3 D: 4 D) than lizards without a bib. Males have significantly smaller 3 D: 4 D than females. Furthermore, we show that experimental elevation of yolk testosterone significantly increases 3 D: 4 D in hatchling painted <b>dragon</b> <b>lizards,</b> but has no influence on hatchling size. Our results provide direct and indirect evidence for the involvement of prenatal sex steroids in digit development and it is suggested that digit ratio may be used as a biomarker for prenatal steroid exposure in this reptilian species. As such, digit ratio may provide a useful tool to study temporal or spatial differences in the proximate hormonal mechanisms modulating physiological and behavioural phenotypes...|$|R

40|$|Examination of size-free {{body shape}} {{for males and}} females of 41 species of Western Australian <b>dragon</b> <b>lizards</b> (Agamidae) {{indicate}} that males generally have a proportionally longer head, and females a proportionally longer abdomen. Principal component and cluster analyses show that size-free body shape differences between males and females are neither uniform nor consistent within the Agamidae, or the genus Ctenophorus. This inconsistency is problematic when linking morphological characteristics with performance traits, use of space, or preferred habitat for species. We recommend that male and female dragons are treated separately in morphological analyses, but acknowledge that this increases the complexity of analyse and interpretations...|$|R
