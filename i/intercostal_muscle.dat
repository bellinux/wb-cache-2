25|$|On {{the second}} day, the match changed. Bradford/Leeds UCCE, thanks to Adam Patel (54), James Duffy (64) and a defiant last wicket {{partnership}} of 86 between Tom Glover (42*) and Simon Crampton (42), took their score to 333, {{a deficit of}} 100. Even worse news for Surrey was a tear to Ian Salisbury's <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscle</b> which put {{him out of the}} rest of the game, and a re-aggravated hamstring injury to Martin Bicknell that stopped him bowling further in the match. Surrey then faltered with the bat, finishing the game on 132 for 6.|$|E

40|$|The {{internal}} <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscles</b> {{were divided}} {{in the outer}} layer, the intermediate <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscles,</b> and the inner layer, the (intrinsic) internal <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscles,</b> by the <b>intercostal</b> nerves passed between both layers (P. Eisler 1912). The intermediate <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscles</b> are present in each intercostal space in all cases except in one case which has 13 ribs, but the internal <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscles</b> are absent in the 1 st upper intercostal spaces constantly, and are also absent in the upper and the lower intercostal spaces in some cases. The intermediate <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscles</b> in the <b>intercostal</b> spaces extend from the angle of ribs to the sternum. At the situation where the cutaneous lateral branches of the intercostal nerves pierce the lateral wall of the thorax, the internal <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscles</b> in each <b>intercostal</b> space disappear and the <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscles</b> are alone in the intercostal spaces. Therefore, the inside of anterior thorax was occupied not by the internal <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscles,</b> by the intermediate <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscles...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{external}} <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscles</b> {{have greater}} post-inspiratory activity than the parasternal <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscles</b> {{and are more}} abundantly supplied with muscle spindles. In the present study, the hypothesis was tested that spindle afferent inputs {{play a major role}} in determining this activity. The electrical activity of the external and parasternal <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscles</b> in the rostral interspaces was recorded in anaesthetized spontaneously breathing dogs, and the ribs were manipulated so as to alter their normal caudal displacement and the normal lengthening of the muscles in early expiration. Post-inspiratory activity in the external <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscles</b> showed a reflex decrease when the caudal motion of the ribs and the lengthening of the muscles was impeded, and it showed a reflex increase when the rate of caudal rib motion and muscle lengthening was increased. In contrast, the small post-inspiratory activity in the parasternal <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscles</b> remained unchanged. When the two ribs making up the interspace investigated were locked to keep muscle length constant, post-inspiratory activity in the external <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscles</b> was reduced and no longer responded to cranial rib manipulation. These observations confirm that afferent inputs from muscle receptors, presumably muscle spindles, are a primary determinant of post-inspiratory activity in the canine external <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscles.</b> In anaesthetized animals, the contribution of central control mechanisms to this activity is small...|$|R

50|$|<b>Intercostal</b> <b>muscle</b> {{activity}} {{decreases in}} REM sleep and contribution of rib cage to respiration decreases during REM sleep. This {{is due to}} REM related supraspinal inhibition of alpha motoneuron drive and specific depression of fusimotor function. Diaphraghmatic activity correspondingly increases during REM sleep. Although paradoxical thoracoabdominal movements are not observed, the thoracic and abdominal displacements are not exactly in phase. This decrease in <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscle</b> activity is primarily responsible for hypoventilation that occurs in patients with borderline pulmonary function.|$|E

50|$|Along {{with the}} diaphragm, the <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscles</b> {{are one of}} the most {{important}} groups of respiratory muscles. These muscles are attached between the ribs and are important in manipulating the width of the rib cage. There are three layers of <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscles.</b> The external <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscles</b> are most significant in respiration. These have fibres that are angled obliquely downward and forward from rib to rib. The contraction of these fibres raises each rib toward the rib above, with the overall effect of raising the rib cage, assisting in inhalation.|$|R

50|$|The {{evolution}} of the turtle's shell is unique because of how the carapace represents transformed vertebrae and ribs. While other tetrapods have their scapula, or shoulder blades, found outside of the ribcage, the scapula for turtles is found inside the ribcage. The shells of other tetrapods, such as armadillos, are not linked directly to the vertebral column or rib cage allowing the ribs to move freely with the surrounding <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscle.</b> However, analysis of the transitional fossil, Eunotosaurus africanus shows that early ancestors of turtles lost that <b>intercostal</b> <b>muscle</b> usually found between the ribs.|$|E
