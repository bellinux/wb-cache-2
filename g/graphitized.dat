They are then mixed with coal-tar pitch and pressed. The pressed green anode is then baked at 1200 °C and <b>graphitized.</b> Coke anodes are made of calcined petroleum coke, recycled anode butts, and coal-tar pitch (binder). The anodes are manufactured by mixing aggregates with coal tar pitch to form a paste with a doughy consistency. This material is most often vibro-compacted but in some plants pressed. The green anode is then sintered at 1100-1200 °C for 300-400 hours, without graphitization, to increase its strength through decomposition and carbonization of the binder. Higher baking temperatures increase the mechanical properties and thermal conductivity, and decrease the air and CO2 reactivity.

40|$|Graphitic layers have {{previously}} been conjectured {{to play an}} active role in diamond nucleation by Lambrecht et al. and may also be involved in a mechanism for homoepitaxial diamond growth since the surfaces of diamond may partially <b>graphitize</b> under high-temperature conditions typical of growth processes. Recent molecular dynamics simulations of the diamond { 111 } surface, briefly reviewed and discussed here, indicate a progressive graphitization with increasing temperature which is strongly facilitated by any kind of surface perturbation or roughness such as step-like adsorbates. Here we show specifically that also twin boundaries promote graphitization. The process of debonding of the surface layer which is a simple displacive motion of the outer layer is also shown to be closely related to the delamination of the tetrahedrally bonded icosahedral C 100 molecule into two concentric C 20 and (fullerene-like) C 80 fragments. In contrast, the tetrahedrally bonded icosahedral C 300 molecule which contains one more concentric shell, does not spontaneously <b>graphitize</b> into a bucky onion (consisting of concentric C 80 and C 240 fullerenes) although the latter has lower energy. Progressive graphitization at a surface towards deeper layers before the top layer is delaminated can occur under certain conditions and then may lead to graphite/diamond prism plane interfaces similar to those previously investigated in connection with nucleation.
