40|$|The high orbital {{speed of}} the International Space Station (ISS) has created a concern about Micro-Meteorite and Orbital Debris (MMOD). The {{possibility}} exists that such an impact could cause significant damage to the ISS pressure wall, and possibly lead to a pressure leak. This paper explores the potential of using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Ultrasonic Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) techniques in order to inspect and analyze MMOD impact damage if such an event would happen to occur. Different types of intra vehicular activity (IVA) Ultrasonic NDE equipment were evaluated, including the Olympus Omniscan MX and the General Electric Phasor XS.

40|$|Carbon fibre {{reinforced}} plastic (CFRP) is a composite composed of very high strength and stiffness carbon fibres within a polymer matrix. Low mass and cost make CFRP attractive for aerospace applications. At present application of CFRP {{is limited by the}} poor residual strength and fatigue properties of the material following impact damage, and because of the limited understanding of the problem. Damage to CFRP results in a combination of fibre fracture and matrix cracking. The strength of CFRP perpendicular to the fibre direction is relatively poor and so the material is generally used as a laminate of unidirectional plies of different fibre orientations. Laminates are particularly prone to delamination, this is matrix cracking which separates plies. In this thesis techniques for measurement of damage type and severity in CFRP are evaluated. These are used to quantify the distribution of damage resulting from hard body impacts at high, low and quasi-static incident velocities. A composite material damage model in a dynamic finite element analysis computer program (DYNA 3 D) was used to predict the experimentally measured impact damage. However the prediction was found to be insufficiently accurate for reliable use by designers. Recommendations are made for improvements in the numerical modelling of impact damage in CFRP. Mechanical tests that provide data on the effect of impact damage on the residual strength of CFRP specimens are reported. These show that providing impact damage is limited to delamination, with little fibre fracture ocurring, the compressive residual strength will be more severely reduced than the tensile property. Strain gauge measurements show that this effect is caused by local compressive buckling of the delaminated plies in the impact damaged area. Lquivalent hole sizes, causing the same residual strengths as in the impact damaged specimens, are given. Cyclic load tests were conducted providing stress-life data for impact damaged specimens of CFRP. The data fit a stress-life diagram divided into three scatter band regions: static fracture; cycle dependent damage growth; and infinite life. Qualitative and quantitative observations are given of the progression of damage in a fatigue after <b>impact</b> <b>damage</b> <b>test.</b> Strain gauge and force/extension measurements show the presence of creep and energy absorption in undamaged and impact damaged CFRP. Much of the observed behaviour may be explained by a viscoelastic model. Because of the presence of viscoelastic creep it is suggested that the fatigue mechanism must depend on interacting cycle dependent and time dependent mechanisms. </p...|$|E

The nanoindentation hardness and Young's moduli of LDGC were measured {{as a function of}} the applied indentation load. The indentation load/size effect (ISE) was analyzed for both measured nanoindentation hardness and Young's moduli. The true hardness, i. e., the load-independent hardness, was determined based on the proportional specimen resistance (PSR) model. Nanoindentation-induced plasticity in LDGC was characterized by in situ SPM imaging of the indented volumes and by measuring pile-up heights of indented cross-sections. The results show that both nanoindentation hardness and Young's modulus are load-dependent following the expended Meyer's law using a power series. At the nanoindentation loads, indented LDGC can be mainly plastically deformed by limiting cracking events.

Delamination was implanted during processing to simulate <b>impact</b> <b>damage.</b> Sublaminate buckling <b>tests</b> were {{performed in a}} novel fixture to measure Compression After Impact (CAI) strength of stitched laminates. The results show that CAI strength can be improved up to 400 % by through-the-thickness stitching.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{two basic}} aspects of <b>impact</b> <b>damage</b> in composite materials, namely damage severity discrimination and <b>impact</b> <b>damage</b> location by using Acoustic Emissions (AE) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The experimental work embodies {{a study of}} such factors as the application of AE as Non-destructive <b>Damage</b> <b>Testing</b> (NDT), and the evaluation of ANNs modelling. ANNs, however, {{played an important role}} in modelling implementation. In the first aspect of the study, different impact energies were used to produce different level of damage in two composite materials (T 300 / 914 and T 800 / 5245). The impacts were detected by their acoustic emissions (AE). The AE waveform signals were analysed and modelled using a Back Propagation (BP) neural network model. The Mean Square Error (MSE) from the output was then used as a damage indicator in the damage severity discrimination study. To evaluate the ANN model, a comparison was made of the correlation coefficients of different parameters, such as MSE, AE energy, AE counts, etc. MSE produced an outstanding result based on the best performance of correlation. In the second aspect, a new artificial neural network model was developed to provide <b>impact</b> <b>damage</b> location on a quasi-isotropic composite panel. It was successfully trained to locate impact sites by correlating the relationship between arriving time differences of AE signals at transducers located on the panel and the impact site coordinates. The performance of the ANN model, which was evaluated by calculating the distance deviation between model output and real location coordinates, supports the application of ANN as an <b>impact</b> <b>damage</b> location identifier. In the study, the accuracy of location prediction decreased when approaching the central area of the panel. Further investigation indicated that this is due to the small arrival time differences, which defect the performance of ANN prediction.

For this aeronautical structure, preliminary studies on the relations among <b>impact</b> energy, <b>impact</b> <b>damage</b> and remaining strength of structure subjected to impact loading are conducted experimentally. In the impact experiments, free-fall dropping dart device with four different kinds of dart heads are used for the plate specimen of MDYB- 3, the <b>impact</b> <b>damages</b> produced by different dart heads are figured by damage depth and damage area. Remaining tensile strength and fatigue life tests are implemented and the relationship between remaining strength of structures and <b>impact</b> <b>damage</b> is studied and discussed. Results obtained from these experiments are basic to further analysis and evaluation on structure survivability...|$|R
40|$|An image {{processing}} algorithm {{based on a}} combination of the most commonly used signal processing techniques in pulsed thermography is applied to monitor the progression of <b>impact</b> <b>damage</b> sites during the full-scale testing of a composite test article. It is demonstrated that the algorithm can be used to monitor damage during a durability and <b>damage</b> tolerance <b>testing.</b> Over {{the first phase of the}} test program, although no damage growth was detected, the processed pulsed thermography images showed that the average standard deviation of the measurements was only ~ 0. 08 inches, the equivalent of 2 infrared camera pixels.
