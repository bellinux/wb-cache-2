50|$|Another type of 2D Lichtenberg figure can {{be created}} when an {{insulating}} surface becomes contaminated with semiconducting material. When a high voltage is applied across the surface, leakage currents may cause localized heating and progressive degradation and charring of the underlying material. Over time, branching, tree-like carbonized patterns are formed upon {{the surface of the}} insulator called electrical trees. This degradation process is called tracking. If the conductive paths ultimately bridge the <b>insulating</b> <b>space,</b> the result is catastrophic failure of the insulating material. Some artists purposely apply salt water to the surface of wood or cardboard and then apply a high voltage across the surface to generate complex carbonized 2D Lichtenberg figures on the surface.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{documents}} two reliable {{methods to}} cope with the rising temperature in an array of heated segments with a known overall heat load and exposed to forced convective boundary layer flow. Minimization of the hot spots (peak temperatures) in the array of heated segments constitutes the primary goal that sets the platform to develop the methods. The two proposed methods consist of: 1) Designing an array of unequal heaters so that each heater has a different size and generates heat at different rates, and 2) Distancing the unequal heaters from each other using an <b>insulated</b> <b>spacing.</b> Multi-scale design based on constructal theory is applied to estimate the optimal <b>insulated</b> <b>spacing,</b> heaters size and heat generation rates, such that the minimum hot spots temperature is achieved when subject to space constraint and fixed overall heat load. It is demonstrated that the two methods can considerably reduce the hot spot temperatures and consequently, both can be utilized with confidence in industry to achieve optimized heat transfer...|$|R
30|$|From the {{experimental}} data shown in Fig.  2 a and Fig.  6 c, {{one can see}} that our nano-submicron-stripe dual-beam Pd sensors work well in detecting local weak temperature changes on a solid surface. When the sensor-heater distance {{is as close as}} 2  μm, as shown in Fig.  2 a, a local temperature fluctuation of 0.1  K is detectable. When the sensor heater distance is increased to 20  μm, the detectable ΔT is around 0.2 – 0.4  K. Therefore, we can expect that when the heating zone is located directly over the sensor, with an <b>insulating</b> <b>space</b> of 20 – 100  nm, for instance, the present dual-beam Pd sensors may ensure a resolution of 0.1  K with reliable stability.|$|E

40|$|A liquid helium dewar {{has been}} designed, fabricated, and {{operated}} successfully {{with a minimum}} background heat-loss rate {{of only a few}} milliwatts. The objective is to provide a facility {{that can be used to}} measure relatively low heat-loss rate (1 [...] 100 milliwatts) in a liquid helium environment. The experimental system consists mainly of an inner helium reservoir within an outer helium reservoir that is thermally shielded from the room-temperature environment by multiple insulation layers in a vacuum environment and a liquid nitrogen reservoir. The inner helium reservoir has a reduced cross-sectional (neck) area to minimize radiative and convective heat transfer to the liquid helium in the lower portion of the reservoir. Experimental results indicate that it takes a long time (> 16 hours) for the system to cool down and reach the minimum heat-loss condition. Strong thermal interactions were observed between the inner and the outer reservoirs above the reduced cross-sectional area of the inner reservoir which is separated from the outer reservoir by a cylindrical stainless steel wall. Temperature measurements showed stratification in the vapor space above the liquid helium in the inner reservoir. Temperature distributions in the vapor space are not one-dimensional, and horizontal temperature gradients exist; this strongly suggests that natural convection may have persisted in the vapor space above the liquid helium in the inner reservoir. To alleviate the problem of strong thermal interactions between the inner and the outer reservoirs, we have since redesigned and tested an improved inner helium reservoir. The new reservoir has a heat intercept, an extended vacuum <b>insulating</b> <b>space</b> between the two helium reservoirs above the heat intercept, and an upper portion made of a thermally insulating epoxy fiberglass composite. Testing showed that interaction between the inner and the outer helium reservoirs of the new system is significantly lower than the original system...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with the present-day situation of Tamil tea plantation workers in Kerala. The plantation Tamils, as they are known locally, belong to Dalits (ex-untouchable/outcaste) communities who have been segregated within Indian society and were kept out of socio-economic progress for centuries. This outcaste social status allied with the identity of coolie - a lower category of manual labour - provided a perfect combination to stigmatise their life and confine it into the <b>insulated</b> <b>space</b> of plantations. The recent economic crisis in Indian tea industry that led to temporary closure of many plantations further deteriorated their life. The closure of the plantations forced many of the workers to seek work outside the plantations. Those who decided to stay back sustain through trade union dictated plucking and selling of tea leaves in the closed plantations and through weekly pocket money (which will deducted from monthly payment of the wages) in the partially working plantations. This new situation became a decisive moment for the plantation workers as it put them in an unusual situation where they have to cope-up, renegotiate, and rethink their life in relation to the crisis, à la survivors of any natural calamities. This is a situation when a state of exception is prolonged to an ordinary state of existence (Agamben 1998) where the crisis continues to be an imagined spectre under which the plantation workers partially experience their life today. The major focus of the research is to identify and delineate the changing nature of the alienation and marginality of the plantation workers in a situation where the nature of plantation as a total institution break down and the workers living in an <b>insulated</b> <b>space</b> of the plantation are exposed to the outside world. My argument is that the workers' alienation in the crisis-context is underpinned in three major processes; a). Exposure of workers to the caste- ridden outside society b). Transformations in the workers' relation with plantation management, trade unions and State; and c). Reintegration of the workers into Dalit migrant workforce outside the plantation system. Accordingly, I contend that the social reproduction of workers' alienation in the crisis-context could be delineated by understanding these processes...|$|R

50|$|A simple {{spark gap}} {{consists}} of two conducting electrodes separated by a gap immersed within a gas (typically air). When a sufficiently high voltage is applied, a spark bridges the gap, ionizing the gas and drastically reducing its electrical resistance. An electric current then flows until the path of ionized gas is broken or the current is reduced below a minimum value called the 'holding current'. This usually occurs when the voltage across the gap drops sufficiently, but the process may also be assisted by cooling the spark channel or by physically separating the electrodes. This breaks the conductive filament of ionized gas, allowing the capacitor to recharge, and permitting the recharging/discharging cycle to repeat. The action of ionizing the gas is quite sudden and violent (disruptive), and it creates a sharp sound (ranging from a snap for a spark plug, to a loud bang for a wider gap). The noise from the spark mechanism, especially from the higher powered transmitters, was so loud that it could seriously interfere with the operator's ability to receive messages after transmitting. Higher powered spark gap mechanisms were isolated from the operator's station in an <b>insulated</b> <b>space</b> called a silent room, which, when the radio was transmitting, was anything but silent inside.

40|$|A growing {{share of}} {{products}} expose sophisticated configurability to handle variations in user and context requirements. Configurators usually rely on variability models, like feature models (FMs), that structure and constrain the available options. However, most feature-based configuration techniques {{do not scale}} well to collaborative contexts. They offer limited mechanisms to determine responsibilities and access rights, to schedule configuration tasks, and to resolve conflicts. Fragments of solutions already exist but a unified and formal foundation for collaborative feature-based configuration is still missing. To provide enhanced control and guidance, we specify responsibilities and rights with views on the FM. Views establish <b>insulated</b> <b>spaces</b> in which users can safely configure {{the part of the}} FM assigned to them. The configuration of these views is regulated by a workflow that defines the configuration process. The result of that combination is a new formalism called feature-based configuration workflow. Finally, to handle conflicts between user decisions, we develop a range fix generation algorithm. These concepts and their properties are integrated into a sound mathematical framework. Our contribution is motivated and illustrated through several real-world applications: a product line of meeting management applications (PloneMeeting), a product line of communication protocols used in the aerospace industry (CFDP), the Linux kernel, and an operating system for embedded applications (eCos). The definitions and algorithms are implemented in a toolset that extends SPLOT, an open source configuration environment, and YAWL, a comprehensive workflow management environment.
