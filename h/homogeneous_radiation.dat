40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} the study is to develop an {{algorithm}} for designing the composition of <b>homogeneous</b> <b>radiation</b> protective materials (RPM) for the radiation protection optimization. <b>Homogeneous</b> <b>radiation</b> protective materials of the Abris type were used in the studies, the manufacturing technology for which makes it possible to obtain the required concentrations of filling agents. The attenuating capacity of a radiation protective material with the barite, lead and tungsten concentrations of 20 – 80 % was estimated using high-precision codes. Experimental studies into the protective properties of the Abris material with different concentrations of filling agents were conducted to verify the calculation results. For the experiment, five sources of gamma radiation (60 Co, 58 Co, 198 Au, 54 Mn, 24 Na) with typical radiation energies were generated in the IVV- 2 M research reactor. A dedicated facility and a DKS-AT 1123 measuring device were also used. As the result of an integrated research, calculated dependences of the attenuation factors have been obtained for the radiation produced by typical radiation sources, and for different RPM compositions and thicknesses. This data forms the input for the optimization of radiation protection. The design of the homogeneous RPM composition is highly promising in terms of the approach to radiation protection optimization. As follows from a comparison of the investigation results for the γ-radiation dose attenuation factors for homogeneous protective materials of the Abris type, depending on composition and thickness, the experimental data differs from the values obtained by calculation by not more than 5 %. The Abris-type homogeneous RPM manufacturing technology makes it possible to provide the required protective properties for particular exposure conditions (composition of radioactive contaminants) ...|$|E

40|$|In {{our most}} {{advanced}} modeling tools for climate change prediction, namely General Circulation Models (GCMs), the schemes {{used to calculate}} the budget of solar and thermal radiation commonly assume that clouds are horizontally homogeneous at scales as large as a few hundred kilometers. However, this assumption, used for convenience, computational speed, and lack of knowledge on cloud small scale variability, leads to erroneous estimates of the radiation budget. This paper provides a global picture of the solar radiation errors at scales of approximately 100 km due to warm (liquid phase) clouds only. To achieve this, we use cloud retrievals from the instrument MODIS on the Terra and Aqua satellites, along with atmospheric and surface information, as input into a GCM-style radiative transfer algorithm. Since the MODIS product contains information on cloud variability below 100 km we can run the radiation algorithm both for the variable and the (assumed) homogeneous clouds. The difference between these calculations for reflected or transmitted solar radiation constitutes the bias that GCMs would commit if they were able to perfectly predict the properties of warm clouds, but then assumed they were <b>homogeneous</b> for <b>radiation</b> calculations. We find that the global average of this bias is approx. 2 - 3 times larger in terms of energy than the additional amount of thermal energy that would be trapped if we were to double carbon dioxide from current concentrations.

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{detailed}} analysis of the rest-frame UV spectrum of the gravitationally lensed Lyman break galaxy (LBG), the ` 8 o'clock arc'. The spectrum of the 8 o'clock arc is rich in stellar and interstellar medium (ISM) features, and presents several similarities to the well-known MS 1512 -cB 58 LBG. The stellar photospheric absorption lines allowed us to constrain the systemic redshift, z_sys = 2. 7350 +/- 0. 0003, of the galaxy, and derive its stellar metallicity, Z= 0. 82 Z_sol. With a total stellar mass of ~ 4. 2 x 10 ^{ 11 } M_sol, the 8 o'clock arc agrees with the mass-metallicity relation found for z> 2 star-forming galaxies. The 31 ISM absorption lines detected led to the abundance measurements of 9 elements. The metallicity of the ISM, Z= 0. 65 Z_sol (Si), is very comparable to the metallicity of stars and ionized gas, and suggests that the ISM of the 8 o'clock arc has been rapidly polluted and enriched by ejecta of OB stars. The ISM lines extend over ~ 1000 km/s and have their peak optical depth blueshifted relative to the stars, implying gas outflows of about - 120 km/s. The Ly-alpha line is dominated by a damped absorption profile on top of which is superposed a weak emission, redshifted relative to the ISM lines by about + 690 km/s and resulting from multiply backscattered Ly-alpha photons emitted in the HII region surrounded by the cold, expanding ISM shell. A <b>homogeneous</b> spherical <b>radiation</b> transfer shell model with a constant outflow velocity, determined by the observations, is able to reproduce the observed Ly-alpha line profile and dust content. These results fully support the scenario proposed earlier, where the diversity of Ly-alpha line profiles in LBGs and Ly-alpha emitters, from absorption to emission, is mostly due to variations of HI column density and dust content (abridged).

However, due to the quasi-point source nature and viewing angle dependence of these illumination sources, the light distribution in LED based reactors can be highly inhomogeneous if the locations of the LEDs in the reactor are not carefully designed. This work describes the design of a novel standardized reactor for accurate measurements of the efficiency of photocatalytic materials under well-controlled lighting conditions. For standardized kinetic studies, it is necessary to ensure that a <b>homogeneous</b> <b>radiation</b> distribution is achieved over the catalyst surface. UV irradiation calculations involving rigorous solution of the radiative transport equation have been performed to compute the incident radiation at each point of the reactor geometry.

We demonstrate that for many of the configurations and distances examined a poor homogeneity over the catalyst surface is obtained if the LED configuration is not carefully designed.

The designed reactor can be also operated for the determination of the activity of photocatalytic materials in a slurry under very high radiation fluxes.

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this article}} is the {{parameters}} determination of equipment for measuring temperature fields in air using an infrared camera. This method is based on the visualization of temperature fields in an auxiliary material, which is inserted into the non-isothermal air flow. The accuracy of air temperature measurement (or of surface temperature of supplies) by this method depends especially on (except for parameters of infrared camera) the determination of the static and the dynamic qualities of auxiliary material. The emissivity of support material is the static quality and the dynamic quality is time constant. Support materials with a high emissivity and a low time constant are suitable for the measurement. The high value of emissivity results in a higher measurement sensitivity and the radiation temperature independence. In this article the emissivity of examined kinds of auxiliary materials (papers and textiles) is determined by temperature measuring of heated samples by a calibrated thermocouple and by thermography, with the emissivity setting on the camera to 1 and with the <b>homogeneous</b> <b>radiation</b> temperature. Time constants are determined by a step change of air temperature in the surrounding of auxiliary material. The time constant depends mainly on heat transfer by the convection from the air into the auxiliary material. That is why the effect of air temperature is examined in this article (or a temperature difference towards the environmental temperature) and the flow velocity on the time constant with various types of auxiliary materials. The obtained results allow to define the conditions for using the method of measurement of temperature fields in air during various heating and air conditioning applications. 1...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} part of the Energy Balance Experiment (EBEX- 2000) was the measurement of the net radiation and its components. Since the terrain, an irrigated cotton field, could not be considered <b>homogeneous,</b> <b>radiation</b> measurements were made at nine sites using a variety of radiation instruments, including pyranometers, pyrgeometers and net radiometers. At several of these sites multiple instruments were employed, which enabled us to compare instruments and assess accuracies. At all sites the outgoing longwave and shortwave radiation and the net radiation were measured, while the incoming radiation was supposed to be uniformly distributed over the field and was therefore measured at three sites only. Net radiation was calculated for all sites from the sum of its four components, and compared with the direct measurement of net radiometers. The main conclusions were: (a) the outgoing shortwave radiation showed differences of up to 30 W m- 2 over the field; the differences were not clearly related to the irrigation events; (b) the outgoing longwave radiation showed differences of up to 50 W m- 2; the differences increased during the periods of irrigation; (c) the net radiation showed differences of several tens of W m- 2 across the field, rising to 50 W m- 2 or more during the periods of irrigation; (d) the net radiation is preferably to be inferred from its four components, rather than measured directly, and (e) attention should be paid to the characteristics of pyranometers that measure the outgoing radiation, and thus are mounted upside down, while they are commonly calibrated in the upward position.

The most perspective way is to use reactive organosiloxanes and to produce metal oligomers based on them. The method of synthesis of nanodispersed oligomer of lead polyalkylsiliconates by a chemical deposition of water solutions of lead ions according to zol-gel process that runs with participation of sodium alkylsiliconates has been developed. Interaction reaction between sodium ethylsiliconate and lead ions in aqueous solution proceeds as the mechanism of replacement of sodium ions in silanol group Si–ONa of sodium alkylsiliconate with lead ion. Finally there is a formation of ring structures, and cross-linking of oligomer molecules takes place while to the number of the siloxane ties is increasing. The microstructure of hydrophobic lead polyethylsiliconate that has amorphous and crystal nature with dense packaging of metal oligomer molecular chains is considered. There is a polyreaction between hydroxyl ОН-groups of metal oligomer and lead oxyhydroxide, i. e. lead oxyhydroxide serves as an adsorbent on which the metal oligomer is chemically absorbed thus giving hydrophobic properties to the product. An opportunity to carry out directional modification of an excipient in the course of collateral synthesis of metal oligomer and a lead excipient, i. e. to receive hydrophobic filled metaloligomer in the homogeneous environment is as a result reached.

Similar conclusions were drawn for leucomalachite green-type dosimeters, only after pre-irradiating the samples to a <b>homogeneous</b> <b>radiation</b> dose. However, in our extensive study of the radio-physical properties of leucocrystal violet- and leucomalachite green-type dosimeters, a significant dose rate dependence was found. For a dose rate variation between 50 and 400 cGy min(- 1), a maximum difference of 75 % was found in optical dose sensitivity for the leucomalachite green-type dosimeter. Furthermore, the measured optical dose sensitivity of the leucomalachite green-type dosimeter was four times lower than the value previously reported in the literature. For the leucocrystal violet-type dosimeter, a maximum difference in optical dose sensitivity of 55 % was found between 50 and 400 cGy min(- 1). A modified composition of the leucomalachite green-type dosimeter is proposed. This dosimeter is composed of gelatin, sodium dodecyl sulfate, chloroform, trichloroacetic acid and leucomalachite green. The optical dose sensitivity amounted to 4. 375 x 10 (- 5) cm(- 1) cGy(- 1) (dose rate 400 cGy min(- 1)). No energy dependence for photon energies between 6 and 18 MV was found. No temperature dependence during readout was found notwithstanding a temperature dependence during irradiation of 1. 90 cGy degrees C- 1 increase on a total dose of 100 cGy. The novel gel dosimeter formulation exhibits an improved spatial stability (2. 45 x 10 (- 7) cm(2) s(- 1) (= 0. 088 mm(2) h(- 1))) and good water/soft tissue equivalence. Nevertheless, the novel formulation was also found to have a significant, albeit reduced, dose rate dependence, as a maximum difference of 33 % was found in optical dose sensitivity when the dose rate varied between 50 and 400 cGy min(- 1). By pre-irradiating the novel leucomalachite green-type dosimeter to 500 cGy, the apparent difference in dose response between 200 and 400 cGy min(- 1) was eliminated, similar to earlier findings. However, a dose response difference of 38 % between 50 and 200 cGy min(- 1) was still measured. On the basis of these experimental results it is concluded that the leucodye micelle gel dosimeter is not yet optimal for dose verifications of high precision radiation therapy treatments. This study, however, indicates that the dose rate dependence has a potential for improvement. Future research is necessary to further minimize the dose rate dependence through extensive chemical analysis and optimization of the gel formulation. Some insights into the physicochemical mechanisms were obtained and are discussed in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Photochemical or photoelectrochemical {{processes}} {{can be employed}} for simultaneous {{treatment of waste water}} and hydrogen production. Thereby abundant but unsteady solar radiation is used to produce a potent chemical energy carrier. The development and demonstration of suitable reactor devices are addressed in the scope of the German project DuaSol. DLR’s test facility SoCRatus (Solar Concentrator with a Rectangular Flat Focus) – see Fig. 1 – will be employed in the experimental assessment of developed devices with respect to solar efficiency and stability. First ideas concerning the concentrator were presented in [1]. The SoCRatus specified by a geometric concentration ratio of 20. 2 provides <b>homogeneous</b> concentrated solar <b>radiation</b> in the rectangular focus extended to 2500 mm x 100 mm. A representative local standard deviation of irradiation relative to the mean of 2. 4 % could be determined. [2] The inlet optics of a spectrometer covering wavelengths in the range from 250 nm to 850 nm is directly located in the focal plane. Additionally a pyrheliometer for DNI measurement mounted at the concentrator structure allows the calculation of the total solar input on the photochemical system. As a result the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency can be contrasted with efficiencies respecting specific wavelength ranges. Four identical fluid cycles are available for connection to reactors. The product gas leaving the reactors is analysed by micro gas-phase chromatographs. The UV-part of incoming solar radiation varies significantly during a day. First experimental findings confirm that the productivity of the applied TiO 2 based photocatalysts correlates rather with the UV irradiation than with the DNI...|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the problem {{consisting}} in the equation (1) partial derivative f/partial derivative t = 1 /x(2) partial derivative/partial derivative x [x(4) (partial derivative f/partial derivative x + f + f(2)) ], when x {{is an element of}} (0, infinity), t > 0, together with no-flux conditions at x = 0 and x = +infinity, i. e. (2) x(4) (partial derivative f/partial derivative x + f + f(2)) = 0 as x [...] > 0 or x [...] > +infinity. Such a problem arises as a kinetic approximation to describe the evolution of the radiation distribution f(x,t) in a <b>homogeneous</b> plasma when <b>radiation</b> interacts with matter via Compton scattering. We shall prove that there exist solutions of (1), (2) which develop singularities near x = 0 in a finite time, regardless of how small the initial number of photons N(0) = integral(0) (+infinity) x(2) f(x, 0) dx is. The nature of such singularities is then analyzed in detail. In particular, we show that the flux condition (2) is lost at x = 0 when the singularity unfolds. The corresponding blow-up pattern is shown to be asymptotically of a shock wave type. In rescaled variables, it consists in an imploding travelling wave solution of the Burgers equation near x = 0, that matches a suitable diffusive profile away from the shock. Finally, we also show that, on replacing (2) near x = 0 as determined by the manner of blow-up, such solutions can be continued for all times after the onset of the singularity. ...|$|R
40|$|Damage from {{occupational}} or {{accidental exposure}} to ionising radiation is often assessed by monitoring chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes, and these procedures have, in several cases, assisted physicians {{in the management}} of irradiated persons. Thereby, circulating lymphocytes, which are in the G 0 stage of the cell cycle are stimulated with a mitogenic agent, usually phytohaemagglutinin, to replicate in vitro their DNA and enter cell division, and are then observed for abnormalities. Comparison with dose-response relationships obtained in vitro allows an estimate of exposure based on scoring: Unstable aberrations by the conventional, well-established analysis of metaphases for chromosome abnormalities or for micronuclei; So-called stable aberrations by the classical G-banding (Giemsa-Stain-banding) technique or by the more recently developed fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) method using fluorescent-labelled probes for centromeres and chromosomes. Three factors need to be considered in applying such biological dosimetry: (1) Radiation doses in the body are often inhomogeneous. A comparison of the distribution of the observed aberrations among cells with that expected from a normal poisson distribution can allow conclusions to be made with regard to the inhomogeneity of exposure by means of the so-called contaminated poisson distribution method; however, its application requires a sufficiently large number of aberrations, i. e. an exposure to a rather large dose at a high dose rate. (2) Exposure can occur at a low dose rate (e. g. from spread or lost radioactive sources) rendering a comparison with in vitro exposure hazardous. Dose-effect relationships of most aberrations that were scored, such as translocations, follow a square law. Repair intervening during exposure reduces the quadratic component with decreasing dose rate as exposure is spread {{over a longer period of}} time. No valid solution for this problem has yet been developed, although, in theory, both deterministic damage and aberrations might be repaired to a similar degree; a comparison of aberrations following a linear dose relationship might also help when the doses have been sufficiently large. (3) Investigations might have been possible only a certain time after the exposure. The relatively rapid disappearance of lymphocytes carrying unstable aberrations limits their use in retrospective dosimetry, years after exposure. Scoring stable aberrations, thought to persist in the circulating lymphocytes, might appear more appropriate in such situations. However, the examination of a representative number of cells by G-banding is extremely laborious, and the FISH method is not only expensive but has not yet been fully validated in different laboratories. In conclusion, biological dosimetry has serious limitations exactly for situations where the need for information is most urgent. It renders its most useful results when an individual has been exposed to a rather <b>homogeneous</b> high-level <b>radiation</b> over a short time interval, i. e. accidents at high-intensity radiation devices. On the other hand, it yielded less satisfactory information even when the most recent techniques were used for situations, where a low level, low dose rate exposure has occurred at some time in the past, for example for persons living in areas contaminated from the Chernobyl accident. Such negative experiences should be kept in mind in order to avoid futile and expensive investigations in the case of populations exposed from radioactivity and, notably, also from potentially clastogenic chemical agents...|$|R
40|$|Concentrated {{solar energy}} {{provides}} thermal energy {{that can be}} utilised for thermochemical conversion of biomass to produce liquid fuel and gases. This creates an efficient and a carbon-free process. The fast pyrolysis of biomass is an endothermic thermal process that occurs within 400 - 550 oC at fast heating rates of > 300 oC/second {{in the absence of}} oxygen. This temperature is within the range produced in a parabolic trough arrangement. The process of biomass gasification is the conversion of biomass fuels to non-condensable gases usually for chemical feedstock or as fuel using a fluidising medium. Solar intermittence is a major issue; this can be resolved by proposing a continuous process from concentrated solar energy to fuels or chemical feedstock. Computational fluid dynamics {{has proven to be a}} tool for design and optimisation of reactors. The Eulerian-Eulerian multiphase model using ANSYS Fluent has shown to be cost-effective at describing the characteristics of complex processes. The project entails using parabolic trough for fast pyrolysis of biomass; it is integrated with a gasification process with utilities produced entirely from solar energy. The scope of the project are: (i) A Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model analysis of the novel reactor is to be developed to model biomass pyrolysis (ii) Investigate the potentials of integrating the proposed solar reactor with a conventional circulating fluidised bed (CFB) gasifier to create a highly efficient and sustainable closed loop thermo-solar process (iii) Validate the circulating fluidised bed model with an experimental scale Circulating fluidised bed (CFB) gasifier at Aston University’s European Bioenergy Research Institute. The report studied the use of CFD modelling to investigate fast pyrolysis of switch grass biomass using a solar parabolic trough receiver/reactor equipped with a novel gas-separation system. The separator controls the effect of tar-cracking reactions and achieves high separation efficiency compared to other gas-solid separation methods. The study assumes an average heat flux concentrated along the receiver/reactor. Pyrolysis reaction was represented as a single global first order Arrhenius type reaction with volatiles separated into condensable (bio-oil) and non-condensable products. The drying of moisture of the switch grass was represented as a mass transfer process. The separation efficiency achieved by the conical deflector was about 99 %. The proposed reactor at the considered operating conditions can achieve overall energy efficiency of 42 %; the product yield consist of 51. 5 % bio-oil, 43. 7 % char and 4. 8 % non-condensable gases. The average reactor temperature, gas residence time, and maximum devolatilisation efficiency were 450 °C, 1. 5 s, and 60 % respectively. There was good agreement in comparison with experimental findings from literature. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to study the effect of heat flux conditions, heat transfer, sweeping gas temperature, and particle size. The heat flux distribution showed that non-homogeneous provides a greater heating rate and temperature compared to the <b>homogeneous</b> flux. <b>Radiation</b> negligibly affects the final product composition; the radiation heats the biomass mainly rather than cause devolatilisation. The larger the biomass diameter the more bio-oil is produced, when a uniform particle temperature is assumed. An experimental study was conducted for the validation of the hydrodynamic model of a circulating fluidised bed. The experiment measured the pressure profiles and the solid recirculation rate. The experiment result showed that particle size has a negative correlation to the ease of fluidisation. High fluidising gas flowrate has a positive impact on the fluidising regime and pressure in the riser. The following parameters were compared with experimental results: grid size, turbulence model, drag laws, wall treatment, and wall shear properties (specularity coefficient and restitution coefficient). The results proved the optimum hydrodynamic model through comparison of pressure profiles of the model with experimental results. The gasification of char in a circulating fluidised was studied using the optimum hydrodynamic model validated from experiment. The model considered the effect of turbulence on the species evolution and tar reforming with char. Over the range of operating conditions, the results looked into the hydrodynamics and product yield of the gasifier. The product yields obtained for the base case was CO (12 %), CO 2 (19 %), H 2 (6 %), CH 4 (0. 7 %), and N 2 (63 %). The results proved that for smaller particles the evolution of species are dominated by kinetics. The catalytic effect of char showed improvement in tar yield and CGE to 15. 12 g/Nm 3 and 67. 74 %. The product yields showed improvement with the compositions of CO 2 and H 2 due to reforming reactions. The yields and efficiency were in qualitative agreement with results from literature. The proposed models described will provide details on the procedures for future design of integrated solar biomass thermochemical conversion systems...|$|R
