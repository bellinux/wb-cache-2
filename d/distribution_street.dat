40|$|As an {{important}} component of the urban ecosystem, the urban greenery provides a series of benefits to urban residents and plays {{an important}} role in maintaining the urban sustainability. Unequal access to urban greenery represents environmental disparities when some urban residents are deprived of the benefits provided by urban greenery. As {{an important component}} of the urban greenery, the street greenery provides a series of benefits to urban residents, such as energy saving, provision of shade and aesthetic values. In addition, the street greenery is a kind of publicly financed amenity and the spatial <b>distribution</b> of the <b>street</b> greenery is influenced heavily by different policies. In this study, I studied the <b>distribution</b> of <b>street</b> greenery in dozens of major American cities and investigated whether racial/ethnic minorities and economically disadvantaged groups are living in neighborhoods with less street greenery. The modified green view index (MGVI), which literally represents the visibility of street greenery or how much street greenery people can see and feel on the ground, was used to represent the <b>distribution</b> of <b>street</b> greenery. The MGVI was calculated based on the publicly accessible Google Street View (GSV) images captured at different horizontal and vertical view angles. Tens of millions GSV images were downloaded for all the selected cities based on the static Google Street View images API to calculate MGVI in the study areas. The environmental inequity in terms of street greenery was further investigated by examining the relationships between the spatial <b>distributions</b> of residential <b>street</b> greenery and socioeconomic variables in different cities at census tract level. Results showed that people with various social conditions have different amounts of street greenery in their living environments in different cities. Generally, people with higher incomes tend to live in places with more street greenery. The percentage of home ownership also plays a positive role in the spatial <b>distribution</b> of <b>street</b> greenery. In summary, this study contributes to literature by providing insights into the living environments of urban residents in terms of street greenery, and it generates a valuable reference data for future urban greening programs...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the characteristics of}} flow pattern and vehicle-emitted pollutant dispersion in roughness surface layer. In an urban environment, wind flow and transported-pollutant source interfere strongly with buildings and other roughness elements on the surface ground, which results in complex characteristics of flow pattern and pollutant dispersion in 3 D circumstances. The present study intends to simplify the research domain and investigate the fundamental modeling problems {{that exist in the}} field. The current physical research topic is restricted to 2 D street canyon in equilibrium conditions. The study is motivated by the fact that characteristics of flow pattern and pollutant <b>distribution</b> inside <b>street</b> canyons are important for public health. The research has applied the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodology. To date, insights have typically focused on idealized street canyons without strictly limited boundary conditions and turbulence models. Those approaches face challenges related to their applicability to real urban scenarios or the reliability of prediction results. The thesis examines the influence of grid density, turbulence models and turbulent Schmidt number on pollutant distribution at windward and leeward surfaces of street canyon. Since numerical results usually are validated with wind-tunnel measurement data, the results between full-size model and wind-tunnel model are compared in order to test the Reynolds number effect. The lack of measurement data means that the morphometric method is used to generate upcoming wind profile, including the mean vertical velocity and turbulence parameters. The thesis also {{analyzes the}} potential errors brought by the method (Scenario A). Based on the evaluated numerical model, the thesis continues to study the impacts of surrounding buildings and geometry of street canyon on flow and pollutant <b>distribution</b> inside <b>street</b> canyons. The effect of wind on pollutant <b>distribution</b> inside <b>street</b> canyons was also investigated (Scenario A). Furthermore, the influence of roof shape and configuration of street canyon on characteristics of flow and pollutant distribution is also systematically studied, with the results shown in scenario B. The main conclusions of the thesis are that the uncertainty of numerical results derives from different aspects. Wind profile in the inlet profile generated by morphometric method brings major error to the simulation results. Current turbulence models cannot compromise the simulation results between flow field and pollutant distribution field. Ignored small-scale obstacles also need to be handled carefully. Numerical results revealed that flow and pollutant <b>distribution</b> inside <b>street</b> canyons are mainly dominated by the geometry of the street canyon itself. Medium-spaced surrounding buildings are also better able to transport pollutant out of the street canyon. Through systematic analysis, roof shape is proven to {{have a significant effect on}} flow and pollutant <b>distribution</b> inside a <b>street</b> canyon. The major impact is altered turbulence intensity depth and strength of shear layer inside the street canyon, which is important for pollutant removal process out of the street canyon. In the future, advanced turbulence models accompanied by small-obstacle effect models need to be developed in order to reliably simulate flow and pollutant dispersion simultaneously. Based on the advanced turbulence model, simulation of flow and pollutant dispersion in a complex 3 D environment is essential in the next steps for the purpose of engineering application. Accurate vertical wind profile provided for inlet profile is another interesting direction for further development.
