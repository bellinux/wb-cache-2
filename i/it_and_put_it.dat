5|$|By 1965, the six {{passenger}} cars of the DRR's Retlaw 1 train, {{due to their}} slow passenger loading and unloading times, began to be phased out of service. In July 1974, the Retlaw 1 {{passenger cars}} were retired and stored in the DRR's roundhouse, except for the Grand Canyon observation coach, which was converted into a parlor car and renamed Lilly Belle after Walt Disney's wife Lillian. The Lilly Belle was given a new exterior paint scheme and a new interior, which included varnished mahogany paneling, velour curtains and seats, a floral-patterned wool rug, and Disney family pictures framed and hung on the walls. The first official passenger to come aboard the Lilly Belle after its conversion into a parlor car in September 1975 was Japanese Emperor Hirohito, and since then it can be regularly seen coupled {{on the ends of}} the DRR's trains. In 1996, rail collector Bill Norred acquired the five other Retlaw 1 passenger cars. Norred died two years later, and in 1999 his family sold the four coaches of the former Retlaw 1 passenger train to Rob Rossi, owner of the Pacific Coast Railroad located within Santa Margarita Ranch in Santa Margarita, California, leaving only the Retlaw 1 combine car in the Norred family's possession. On July 10, 2010, the Norred family sold the Retlaw 1 combine car to the Carolwood Foundation, which restored <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> on display next to Walt Disney's Carolwood Barn within the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum complex in Los Angeles' Griffith Park.|$|E

25|$|According to the {{witnesses}} who were interviewed during the investigation, {{one of the}} fans fell at the lower steps of Stairway 1. According to some reports, it was a young woman, who had lost her shoe on the stairs and stopped, trying to retrieve <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> back on. A couple of people also stopped, {{trying to help the}} fan in need, but the moving dense crowd on the stairs, limited by metal banisters, promptly crushed them down. People began to stumble over the bodies of those who were crushed in a domino effect.|$|E

And that song didn't take us but a minute to do, because she really busted that out within two days. We did a rough copy and let Tommy Mottola hear it and he loved it, so all {{we had to do}} was bring it back in and mix it.|$|E
500|$|Canadian Pacific Railway Locomotive No. 2816 was {{acquired}} by Blount in January 1964. [...] It was built by Montreal Locomotive Works in 1930. The 4-6-4 Hudson, H1b class locomotive had logged over [...] in 30 years of service pulling passenger trains between Winnipeg and Calgary, and Winnipeg and Fort William, Ontario. Later, 2816 served on the Windsor-to-Quebec City corridor. [...] The locomotive's final run was on May 26, 1960, pulling a Montreal–Rigaud commuter train. [...] The Steamtown Special History Study recommended that the locomotive be kept in the collection, {{as it was the}} only 4-6-4 in the group, but the National Park Service sold it back to Canadian Pacific Railway, who restored <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> back into service.|$|E

500|$|In 1982, film {{director}} Steven Spielberg bought a [...] "Rosebud" [...] sled for $60,500; {{it was one}} of three balsa sleds used in the closing scenes and the only one that was not burned. After the Spielberg purchase, it was reported that retiree Arthur Bauer claimed to own another [...] "Rosebud" [...] sled. In early 1942 when Bauer was 12 he won an RKO publicity contest and selected the hardwood sled as his prize. In 1996, Bauer's estate offered the painted pine sled at auction through Christie's. Bauer's son told CBS News that his mother had once wanted to paint the sled {{and use it as a}} plant stand, but Bauer told her to [...] "just save <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in the closet." [...] The sled was sold to an anonymous bidder for $233,500.|$|E
500|$|The band's lead singer/guitarist Patrick Stump {{stated that}} the band had not planned to cover the song. [...] "Basically, I just started playing the riff in sound-check one day, and then we all started playing it, and then we started playing it live, and then we figured we'd record <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> out with our live DVD." [...] Bassist Pete Wentz added that the band had not {{originally}} intended for the song to be released as a single either. [...] "'Beat It' seemed like a song that would be cool and {{that we could do}} our own take on", he said. Having spent time deciding on a guitarist for the song, Wentz eventually called John Mayer to add the guitar solo. [...] "We were trying to think about who is a contemporary guitar guy who's going to go down as a legend", Wentz later noted.|$|E
500|$|When the game's {{text was}} {{translated}} from Japanese to English, the game {{needed to be}} reprogrammed {{in order to accomplish}} this; different companies handled this process in different ways. Tecmo's Japanese writers wrote rough translations in English, and they would then fax them to the American division. According to Criona, the American division would [...] "edit <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> back together, telling the story in a context that an American English speaker would understand. This would go back and forth several times." [...] Moreover, the game's text was stored in picture files instead of raw computer text, and because of the NES' hardware limitations, the English text need to be very clear and concise to fall within those limitations; many times, different words with the same meaning but with fewer characters had to be used. All symbols and objects were scrutinized by Nintendo of America, who had specific rules on what could be included for North American releases; for instance, any Satanic, Christian, or any other religious, sexual, or drug-related references were not allowed.|$|E

500|$|Kemp was {{a critic}} of {{association}} football, known as soccer in the United States. In 1986, during a House floor debate over whether the United States should host the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Kemp proclaimed: [...] "I {{think it is important}} for all those young out there—who someday hope to play real football, where you throw it and kick it and run with <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in your hands— a distinction should be made that football is democratic capitalism, whereas soccer is a European socialist sport." [...] Kemp compared his speech to George Carlin's 1984 comedy routine on the differences between baseball and American football and wrote that his [...] "tongue was firmly planted in cheek" [...] when making the speech. Despite the levity of the speech, it garnered significant backlash. However, he continued to insist that soccer's main problem is [...] "it doesn't have a quarterback". Kemp noted that about half of his grandchildren play or have played organized soccer and claimed to have [...] "changed" [...] his position on soccer. He even attended the 1994 FIFA World Cup with longtime soccer fan Henry Kissinger, although he wrote during the 2006 FIFA World Cup that soccer can be interesting to watch but is still a [...] "boring game".|$|E

2500|$|In 1987 Mueller {{had this}} to say about the shuttle, [...] "It was clear to us at that time that we needed to have a joint program between the Air Force and NASA, and that that program ought to be aimed at {{providing}} low cost space transportation for all of our needs. It's just in my view unfortunate that we made the compromise, after I left NASA, in terms of a partially reusable vehicle, and all that that implies in terms of not only the cost of the throw-away parts but also the cost of the ground troops that have to process <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> together and fly it every time. That combination—and ground support is a not insignificant part of a Shuttle cost—was a set of decisions that doomed low cost space transportation for that generation of vehicles." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1913 Anna Alston married Harry Bearden. Through the marriage, {{the future}} artist Romare Bearden became Charles’ cousin. The two Bearden {{families}} {{lived across the}} street from each other; the friendship between Romare and Charles would last a lifetime. As a child Alston was inspired by his older brother Wendell's drawings of trains and cars, which the young artist copied. Charles also played with clay, creating a sculpture of North Carolina. As an adult he reflected on his memories of sculpting with clay as a child: [...] "I’d get buckets of <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> through strainers and make things out of it. I think that's the first art experience I remember, making things." [...] His mother was a skilled embroiderer and took up painting at the age of 75. His father was also good at drawing, wooing Alston's mother with small sketches in the medians of letters he wrote her.|$|E
2500|$|Wayagamack was {{successful}} until the Great Depression when the paper market collapsed. The island property {{was taken over}} by Consolidated Paper Corporation Limited in 1931, but they showed little interest in <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> up for sale. Offers came from Canadian, American, British, French and Belgian parties. In July 1937, an offer was received from a consortium of Dutch and German capitalists who intended to build a sulphite mill and wanted a steady supply of pulpwood and access to Canadian capital. In the autumn of that year, a team of German surveyors travelled to the island to examine its timber and export potential. When this story broke in the Montreal Gazette of 2 December 1937, it caused an immediate controversy since the story claimed that the survey team was really made up of Adolf Hitler's agents and that most were naval, military and fortifications experts. Despite the substantial offer, the promise of thousands of new jobs, and {{the fact that there were}} no legal methods to block the sale, the suspicions remained. A committee was set up to investigate the affair but concluded that [...] "there was no evidence to indicate that the project has other than a commercial purpose". When the deadline to purchase the island passed on 15 September 1938, the offer expired and controversy died out.|$|E

50|$|There {{have been}} mixed reviews on the {{efficacy}} of managerialism, explored extensively in university studies of the State. Some have accepted the flaws in the theory, building upon <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> forth as a valid theory of the State. Others have outright rejected such a proposition, responding that - regardless of the few similarities - such a system could not be successful on a political level.|$|R
