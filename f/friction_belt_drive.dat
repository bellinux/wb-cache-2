The grippers are formed as drawbars (2) which can be swivelled about rotating joints (1), having rotating rollers (8) at their picking ends for hooking into {{the handle of the}} storage container (7), whereby the swivel movement of the drawbar (2) is driven by a single linear drive (15) and a detent pawl (12) interacting with the linear drive (15) and the drawbar (2) is provided to change the pull-in/out movement of the drawbar (2). A <b>friction</b> <b>belt</b> <b>drive</b> (10) engaging laterally in the storage container (7) is arranged in the inner contour area of the load carrying device, the reaction force of the <b>friction</b> <b>belt</b> <b>drive</b> being taken up by pressure absorption devices (11) loca ted opposite...|$|E

40|$|A novel <b>friction</b> drive—a metal <b>belt</b> <b>drive</b> with magnets (MBDM) —is {{proposed}} in this paper, and its structure and principle are introduced. Based on theories of friction drive and electromagnetism, a mechanical {{model of the}} MBDM is presented and a Euler formula of this drive is deduced. Finally, several performance parameters of the MBDM are experimentally measured and compared to conventional <b>belt</b> <b>drives.</b> The {{results show that the}} MBDM transmits motion and power by using the coupling action between the magnetic attraction and initial tension. The transmission efficiency of the MBDM can reach 95 – 98 %, while its elastic creep rate is < 0. 1 % under normal running conditions...|$|R

Results of the Scania <b>Belt</b> <b>Drive</b> Library are validated against the experimental data and AVL/Timing Drive. Advantages such as the possibility of changing or updating the components equations, start up simulation, being less error prone due to user inputs, and even simulation performance are the major reasons for which the Scania <b>Belt</b> <b>Drive</b> Library has been created.

40|$|Efficient belts {{can provide}} the same {{magnitude}} of energy savings as energy-efficient motors. Therefore, <b>belt</b> <b>drives</b> deserve greater attention, so that their losses should be minimized. The <b>belt</b> <b>drive</b> power losses are a combination of torque losses and speed losses. However, the determination of <b>belt</b> <b>drive</b> behavior in terms of power losses requires extensive experimental investigations. Therefore, in this study, belt slip and torque losses were investigated experimentally with a laboratory constructed test bench. Measurement System Analysis (MSA) was performed in order to investigate the test rig reliability.

However, the stress–strength interference model is essentially a static model, and the sensitivity analysis of <b>belt</b> <b>drive</b> reliability with respect to design parameters needs further investigations. In this article, time-dependent factors that contribute the dynamic characteristics of reliability are pointed out. Moreover, dynamic reliability models and failure rate models of <b>belt</b> <b>drive</b> systems under the failure mode of slipping are developed. Furthermore, dynamic sensitivity models of <b>belt</b> <b>drive</b> reliability based on the proposed dynamic reliability models are proposed. In addition, numerical examples are given to illustrate the proposed models and analyze the influences of design parameters on dynamic characteristics of reliability, failure rate, and sensitivity functions. The results show that the statistical properties of design parameters have different influences on reliability and failure rate of <b>belt</b> <b>drive</b> in cases of different values of design parameters and different operational durations...|$|R

The tension causes pulley {{eccentric}} in <b>belt</b> <b>drive.</b> Through {{the analysis}} of the shaft deformation caused by the pulley eccentric, this paper resulted in the calculation method and related formulas for <b>belt</b> <b>drive</b> rotary motion error under different tension. And based on the PDJ- 4 <b>belt</b> <b>drive</b> experiment facility giving examples of analysis, we draw the conclusion that with the increase of tension, rotary motion error increases at the same time. Thus it will have a greater rotary motion error when the tension is too large. This paper proposed the scheme and measures to improve that error eventually...|$|R
