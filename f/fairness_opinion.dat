40|$|This study {{examines}} investment bankers 2 ̆ 7 valuation analyses disclosed in <b>fairness</b> <b>opinions</b> in negotiated mergers from 1998 to 2005 and reports the following findings. First, acquirer advisors tend to issue optimistically biased valuations of target firms: on average, acquirer-side investment banks value targets significantly above offer prices. This bias is {{unrelated to the}} contingency structure of advisory fees, advisor rankings, or pre-established relationships with acquirers or targets. Second, target-side investment banks produce <b>fairness</b> <b>opinions</b> that correctly value targets on average. Third, target-sought <b>fairness</b> <b>opinions</b> contain valuable information previously unavailable to the market: target valuations in excess of offer prices are positively correlated with acquirers 2 ̆ 7 abnormal returns around the proxy statement dates in which <b>fairness</b> <b>opinions</b> are publicly revealed.

Signal received a <b>fairness</b> <b>opinion</b> from Lehman Brothers, stating that $21 per share was a fair price, although the <b>fairness</b> <b>opinion</b> may have been based upon hasty and incomplete review.

5000|$|A <b>fairness</b> <b>opinion</b> is a {{professional}} evaluation by an investment bank or other third party {{as to whether the}} terms of a merger, acquisition, buyback, spin-off, or privatization are fair. [...] It is rendered for a fee. [...] They are typically issued when a public company is being sold, merged or divested of all or a substantial division of their business. They can also be required in private transactions not involving a company that is traded on a public exchange, as well as in circumstances other than mergers, such as a corporation exchanging debt for equity. Some of the specific functions of a <b>fairness</b> <b>opinion</b> are to aid in decision-making, mitigate risk, and enhance communication.|$|E

40|$|<b>Fairness</b> <b>opinions</b> {{provided}} by investment banks advising on {{mergers and acquisitions}} {{have been criticized for}} being conflicted in aiding bankers further their goal of completing the deal as opposed to aiding boards (and shareholders) by providing an honest appraisal of deal value. We find empirical support for this criticism. We find that shareholders {{on both sides of the}} deal, aware of the conflict of interest facing advisors, rationally discount deals where advisors provide <b>fairness</b> <b>opinions.</b> The reputation of the advisor serves to mitigate this discount, while the contingent nature of advisory fees appears to have no impact. Furthermore, consistent with the criticism of <b>fairness</b> <b>opinions,</b> we find evidence suggesting that <b>fairness</b> <b>opinions</b> are sought by boards for the legal cover they provide against shareholders unhappy with the deal’s terms. Thus, altogether our findings suggest that investment bankers and boards may be complicit in using <b>fairness</b> <b>opinions</b> to further their own interests at an expense to shareholders.

He also served on the firm's <b>Fairness</b> <b>Opinion</b> Review Committee and managed the Atlanta office and activities in the Sunbelt Region of the United States. Prior to joining Robertson Stephens, Mr. Goldman was a Managing Director with the Robinson-Humphrey Company which was later acquired by SunTrust (...) , where he headed the Healthcare Group.

50|$|No salaries, finder's fees {{or other}} cash {{compensation}} {{are paid to}} the management team prior to the business combination and the management team does not participate in a liquidating distribution if it fails to consummate a successful business combination.

Conflicts of interest are minimized within the SPAC structure because all management teams agree to offer suitable prospective target businesses to the SPAC before any other acquisition fund, subject to pre-existing fudiciary duties. The SPAC is further prohibited from consummating a business combination with any entity which is affiliated with an insider, unless a <b>fairness</b> <b>opinion</b> from an independent investment banking firm states that the combination is fair to the shareholders.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{employees}} of Myspace, including DeWolfe and Berman, {{were able to}} purchase equity in the property before MySpace and its parent company eUniverse (now renamed Intermix Media) was bought. In July 2005, {{in one of the}} company's first major Internet purchases, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation (the parent company of Fox Broadcasting and other media enterprises) purchased Myspace for US$580 million. News Corporation had beat out Viacom by offering a higher price for the website, and the purchase was seen as a good investment at the time. Of the $580 million purchase price, approximately $327 million has been attributed to the value of Myspace according to the financial adviser <b>fairness</b> <b>opinion.</b> Within a year, Myspace had tripled in value from its purchase price. News Corporation saw the purchase as a way to capitalize on Internet advertising, and drive traffic to other News Corporation properties. After losing the bidding war for Myspace, Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone stunned the entertainment industry in September 2006 when he fired Tom Freston from the position of CEO. Redstone believed that the failure to acquire MySpace contributed to the 20% drop in Viacom's stock price in 2006 up to the date of Freston's ouster. Freston's successor as CEO, Philippe Dauman, was quoted as saying [...] "never, ever let another competitor beat us to the trophy". Redstone told interviewer Charlie Rose that losing MySpace had been [...] "humiliating", adding, [...] "MySpace was sitting there for the taking for $500 million" [...] (Myspace was sold in 2012 by News Corp for $35 million.) ...|$|E

40|$|This Article re-examines the <b>fairness</b> <b>opinion,</b> {{as well as}} {{its role}} and {{necessity}} in corporate control transactions. This Article argues that today 2 ̆ 7 s <b>fairness</b> <b>opinion</b> regime is deeply flawed and, as a consequence, a <b>fairness</b> <b>opinion</b> has little meaning. The reasons are primarily this: the financial analyses underlying fairness opinions, as currently prepared by investment banks, are prone to excessive subjectivity and are frequently the product of valuation techniques that are not in accord with best practices. These defects are exacerbated by the recurring problem of these same investment banks who are conflicted in their provision of these opinions. Meanwhile, SEC and FINRA regulation of fairness opinions does not adequately address these fundamental issues while the Delaware courts continue to periodically reassert, without question, Smith v. Van Gorkom 2 ̆ 7 s implicit <b>fairness</b> <b>opinion</b> requirement, thereby bestowing excessive significance to the <b>fairness</b> <b>opinion.</b> This Article, though, does not call for the <b>fairness</b> <b>opinion</b> 2 ̆ 7 s death. Rather, I argue that the <b>fairness</b> <b>opinion</b> regime should be reformed through a quasi-public, standard-setting body. Creation of this body and its adoption of standards and guidelines for preparation of a <b>fairness</b> <b>opinion</b> and its undergirding financial analyses, as well as heightened disclosure requirements, should enhance the economics and usefulness of the <b>fairness</b> <b>opinion</b> by reducing subjectivity in valuation, ensuring proper grounding and permitting increased market scrutiny. Implementation of these reforms would also do more to alleviate the related and repeatedly cited problem of investment bank conflicts of interest than prior disclosure-based and other proposals. If these reforms are adopted, the <b>fairness</b> <b>opinion,</b> in and of itself, is still not a panacea. It will always be an inferior substitute for a market-based approach to determine the fairness of the consideration in a corporate control transaction. However, a valuation conducted with rigor and in accordance with disclosed standards and guidelines can inform materially as to value when a market-based price is unavailable or unobtainable. In such a context, a <b>fairness</b> <b>opinion</b> can have meaning. Even in such situations, though, the inherent limitations of state-of-the-art valuation should be recognized; a <b>fairness</b> <b>opinion</b> should only be one of many tools to assist a board in gauging what is a fair price. The Delaware courts should recognize this, repudiating Van Gorkom 2 ̆ 7 s wholesale, implicit <b>fairness</b> <b>opinion</b> requirement when the agreed price is a market-based one. In other circumstances, a <b>fairness</b> <b>opinion</b> should not be required, but if received, should be considered by the Delaware courts as only one indicative factor to be utilized in assessing a board 2 ̆ 7 s satisfaction of its duty of care...|$|E
40|$|A key {{question}} in Mergers and Acquisitions {{is whether the}} transactions are fair. A common practice is to ask a financial advisor to evaluate the fair value of a transaction and provide a <b>fairness</b> <b>opinion.</b> However, fairness opinions have been viewed as a “rubber stamp ” since almost every target firm obtains one. Using a manually compiled data set over the period 1996 - 2011, I examine why some target firms choose to obtain a second <b>fairness</b> <b>opinion</b> and the wealth effects of this choice. More specifically, I test two competing hypotheses: the agency theory hypothesis which predicts {{the use of multiple}} opinions destroys shareholder value, and the shareholder interests hypothesis which argues that target firms obtain a second <b>fairness</b> <b>opinion</b> for strategic reasons. The results show that after controlling for endogeneity, the use of multiple opinions has a significantly positive impact on announcement returns. Target firms are more likely to obtain a second <b>fairness</b> <b>opinion</b> in management buyout deals, in hostile deals, and in large deals. A second <b>fairness</b> <b>opinion</b> is also more likely to be sought if the target has multiple business segments. Overall, my findings provide new evidence that is consistent with the shareholder interests hypothesis and is inconsistent with the agency theory hypothesis...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the period}} 1994 - 2003, 80 % of targets and 37 % of acquirers obtain a {{third-party}} {{assessment of the}} fairness of a merger or acquisition. These fairness opinions do not affect deal outcomes when used by targets, but they affect deal outcomes when used by acquirers. The deal premium is lower in transactions if the acquirer obtains a <b>fairness</b> <b>opinion,</b> and is further reduced if multiple advisors provide an opinion. However, the acquirer's announcement-period return is 2. 3 % lower if the acquirer has a <b>fairness</b> <b>opinion,</b> especially if the acquirer pays a high premium, indicating that investors are skeptical of these transactions. <b>Fairness</b> <b>opinion</b> Merger Conflict of interest Deal premium Announcement return...|$|E
40|$|This Article re-examines the <b>fairness</b> <b>opinion,</b> {{as well as}} {{its role}} and necessity.

Finance, a young discipline, has also progressed markedly, and previously held assumptions and methodologies have been rejected, refined, or revised. This Article also analyzes the <b>fairness</b> <b>opinion</b> in light of these developments in law and finance. I conclude that current <b>fairness</b> <b>opinion</b> practice is still deeply flawed.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of fairness opinions promulgating "wide as Texas" price ranges {{is not only}} a seeming regulatory failure, it is a puzzle: why do 60 percent of target boards solicit seemingly worthless documents not required by law, while 40 percent of their peers do not? This article explains a <b>fairness</b> <b>opinion</b> as "cheap talk" between a board and public shareholders. In the <b>Fairness</b> <b>Opinion</b> Game, a board issues a <b>fairness</b> <b>opinion</b> to communicate with two shareholder generations: existing shareholders voting on the proposed sale of their shares and potential aftermarket buyers who would buy if the present transaction falls through. The game yields two equilibria: one where the board issues no opinions and one where Texas-wide opinions emerge as equilibrium messages. We conclude that three factors determine a fairness opinion's width: the board's private incentives, information asymmetry between the board and shareholders, and transaction costs incurred by aftermarket buyers.
