40|$|Implanted {{medical devices}} such as {{pacemakers}} and neural prosthetics require that the electronic components that power these devices are protected from the harsh chemical and biological environment of the body. Typically, the electronics are hermetically sealed inside a bio-compatible package containing <b>feedthroughs</b> that transmit electrical signals, while being impermeable to particles or moisture. We present a novel approach for fabricating {{one of the highest}} densities of biocompatible hermetic <b>feedthroughs</b> in alumina (Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }). Alumina substrates with laser machined vias of 200 {micro}m pitch were conformally metallized and lithographically patterned. Hermetic electrical <b>feedthroughs</b> were formed by extruding metal stud-bumps partially through the vias. Hermeticity testing showed leak rates better than 9 x 10 {sup - 10 } torr-l/s. Based on our preliminary results and process optimization, this extruded metal via approach is a high-density, low temperature, cost-effective, and robust method of miniaturizing electrical <b>feedthroughs</b> {{for a wide range of}} implantable bio-medical device applications...|$|R
2500|$|This {{portion of}} the op amp cleverly changes a {{differential}} signal at the op amp inputs to a single-ended signal {{at the base of}} Q15, and in a way that avoids wastefully discarding the signal in either leg. To see how, notice that a small negative change in voltage at the inverting input (Q2 base) drives it out of conduction, and this incremental decrease in current passes directly from Q4 collector to its emitter, resulting in a decrease in base drive for Q15. On the other hand, a small positive change in voltage at the non-inverting input (Q1 base) drives this transistor into conduction, reflected in an increase in current at the collector of Q3. This current drives Q7 further into conduction, which turns on current mirror Q5/Q6. Thus, the increase in Q3 emitter current is mirrored in an increase in Q6 collector current; the increased collector currents shunts more from the collector node and results in a decrease in base drive current for Q15. Besides avoiding wasting 3dB of gain here, this technique decreases common-mode gain and <b>feedthrough</b> of power supply noise.|$|E
50|$|A vacuum <b>feedthrough</b> is {{a flange}} that {{contains}} a vacuum-tight electrical, physical or mechanical connection to the vacuum chamber. An electrical <b>feedthrough</b> allows voltages {{to be applied to}} components under vacuum, for example a filament or heater. An example of a physical <b>feedthrough</b> is a vacuum-tight connection for cooling water. A mechanical <b>feedthrough</b> is used for rotation and translation of components under vacuum. A wobble stick is a mechanical <b>feedthrough</b> device {{that can be used to}} pick up, move and otherwise manipulate objects in the vacuum chamber.|$|E
5000|$|In analog electronics, Clock <b>feedthrough</b> is {{the result}} of the {{coupling}} between control signals on the analog switch and analog signal passing through the switch. In digital electronics, clock <b>feedthrough</b> is the coupling of the clock signal to the nodes where coupling is not intended. Such coupling happens because of the gate-to-source capacitance, interconnects parasitic capacitance or because of the substrate coupling. Clock <b>feedthrough</b> is generally considered harmful.

A glass cap with embedded 50 !m diameter vertical single-crystal silicon <b>feedthroughs</b> is anodically bonded in vacuum to an SOI wafer prefabricated with mechanical resonators. This hermetic packaging process provides virtually zero-parasitic-capacitance vertical interconnects. A silicon-gold eutectic {{is used to}} ensure electrical contacts between the <b>feedthroughs</b> and the device wafer. An embedded wet-etched cavity in the glass cap allows mechanical motion of the resonator {{as well as the}} inclusion of a thin-film getter to further enhance and maintain vacuum.

5000|$|A <b>feedthrough</b> {{electrical}} connection {{may have to}} withstand considerable pressure difference across its length. Systems that operate under high vacuum, such as electron microscopes, require {{electrical connection}}s through the pressure vessel. Similarly, submersible vehicles require <b>feedthrough</b> connections between exterior instruments and devices and the controls within the vehicle pressure hull. A very common example of a <b>feedthrough</b> connection is an automobile spark plug where {{the body of the}} plug must resist the pressure and temperature produced in the engine, while providing a reliable electrical connection to the spark gap in the combustion chamber. (Spark plugs are occasionally used as low-cost or improvised <b>feedthrough</b> connections in non-engine applications.) ...|$|E

This is particularly valid for fiber optics <b>feedthroughs</b> that involve several materials with significantly different thermal expansion ratios. Thermal loading in such structures may give rise to non-trivial thermally induced deformations and therewith stresses, which can be adequately predicted and assessed only by a detailed 3 -D numerical simulation. This paper considers a couple of design solutions of fiber optics <b>feedthroughs,</b> which have exhibited certain weaknesses in their application.

50|$|Magnetic liquid rotary seals {{operate with}} no {{maintenance}} and extremely low leakage {{in a very}} wide range of applications. Ferrofluid-based seals used in industrial and scientific applications are most often packaged in mechanical seal assemblies called rotary <b>feedthroughs,</b> which also contain a central shaft, ball bearings and an outer housing. The ball bearings provide two important functions: maintaining the shaft's centering within the seal gap, and supporting external loads. The bearings are the only mechanical wear-items, as the dynamic seal is actually a series of rings made of ultra-low vapor pressure, oil-based liquid held magnetically between the rotor and stator. Therefore, the operating life and equipment maintenance cycles are generally very long, and the drag torque very low. The magnet material is permanently charged and requires no electrical power or other re-energizing or maintenance. Ferrofluid-sealed <b>feedthroughs</b> reach performance levels that other technologies can't achieve, by optimizing features such as ferrofluid viscosity and magnetic strength, magnet and steel materials, bearing arrangements, and water cooling for applications with extremely high speeds or temperatures. Ferrofluid-sealed <b>feedthroughs</b> routinely operate in environments including ultra-high vacuum (below 10−8 mbar), temperatures over 1,000 °C, {{tens of thousands of}} RPM, and multiple-atmosphere pressures.|$|R

40|$|A {{relatively}} simple and reliable gasket insulation technique for electrical <b>feedthroughs</b> in the Diamond Anvil Cell has been successfuly developed. This involved the use of, {{easy to use}} components such as epoxy resins which can be easily obtained, and, the use of simple equipment which are part of any reasonably equiped laboratory. Photoconductivity, demonstrator, experiments on strained layer quantum well material were successfully used to prove the feasibility of these techniques. The pressure coefficient values obtained for strained InGaAs/GaAs, InGaAs/AlGaAs and unstrained InGaAs/InGaAsP were in agreement with that obtained with a photoluminescence technique. Unlike photoluminescence {{it is also possible}} to obtain the pressure coefficients of higher energy states with the photoconductivity experiment. In the process, laminated gaskets for electrical measurements were also developed. This has led to a tremendous improvement in the experimental reliability {{to such an extent that}} the electrical <b>feedthroughs</b> have become almost as routine as the optical experiments. Further, it is now possible to use ordinary optically cut anvils to conduct electrical <b>feedthroughs</b> without resorting to specially designed ones, such as rounded or multiple bevelled anvils, or, even depositing permanent conducting strips onto the diamond culets. The benefits of this is that obtaining ordinary cut anvils is much simpler than obtaining specialist bevelled or rounded edge anvils...|$|R

The various processing steps, including the installation of six emitter thermocouples, encapsulation in the secondary container, and joining to the fission-gas collection system, are described in detail. In addition to the converter assembly, a doubly contained fission gas collection assembly with radiation-hardened differential pressure transducers was fabricated.

40|$|RF-MEMS devices (Radio Frequency-MicroElectroMechanical Systems) {{are made}} of {{moveable}} and fragile structures (membranes, beams, cantilevers,…) that must be encapsulated for protection and for stable performance characteristics.

The fabrication process is described and packages are characterized in terms of mechanical strength, hermeticity and microwave performance in the range 1 - 50 GHz. Simulations and experiments show minimal impact of the package on the RF losses if the cap has a minimal height of 50 µm, if low-loss materials (e. g., glass) are used, and if matched RF <b>feedthroughs</b> are implemented. Finally, in a multi-switch design, we recommend to minimize the number of <b>feedthroughs,</b> i. e. to use a single cap for the entire design...|$|R
