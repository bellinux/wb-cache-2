Although {{it is well known}} that the reduction of fat content of allografts increases mechanical properties, the content of liquids with a known grain size distribution has not been assessed so far. The aim of the study was to compare the mechanical properties of dried allografts (DA) with allografts mixed with a saline solution (ASS) and with allografts mixed with blood (AB) having a similar grain size distribution. Fresh-frozen morselized bone chips were cleaned chemically, sieved, and reassembled in specific portions with a known grain size distribution. A uniaxial compression was used to assess the yield limit, initial density, density at yield limit, and flowability of the three groups before and after compaction with a <b>fall</b> <b>hammer</b> <b>apparatus.</b> No statistically significant difference could be found for the yield limit between DA and ASS (p = 0. 339) and between ASS and AB (p = 0. 554). DA showed a statistically significant higher yield limit than AB (p = 0. 022). Excluding the effect of the grain size distribution on the mechanical properties, it was shown that allografts have a lower yield limit when lipids are present. The liquid content of allografts seems to play an inferior role as no statistically significant difference could be found between DA and ASS. It is suggested, in accordance with other studies, to chemically clean allografts before implantation to reduce the contamination risk and the fat content...|$|E
40|$|Recent data {{obtained}} from Rana temporaria sartorius muscles during an isometric tetanus indicate that the time-course of phosphocreatine (PC) splitting cannot account for the total energy (heat + work) liberation (Gilbert et al. 1971.

As this conclusion is important {{to an understanding of}} the chemical energetics of contraction, similar experments were performed on unpoisoned, oxygenated Rana pipiens sartorius muscles. The muscles were tetanized (isometrically) at 0 degrees C for 0. 6, 1, or 5 s; metabolism was rapidly arrested by freezing the muscles with a specially designed <b>hammer</b> <b>apparatus,</b> and the frozen muscles were chemically analyzed. Comparable myothermal measurments were made on frogs from the same batch. Results of these experiments indicate: (a) The energy liberation parallels the PC and ATP breakdown with a proportionality constant of 10. 7 kcal/mol; (b) comparably designed experiments with sartorius muscles of R. temporaria revealed that the ratio of energy liberation to PC splitting was significantly greater than that observed in R. pipiens sartorius muscles; (c) there is no systematic difference between experiments in which metabolism was arrested by the <b>hammer</b> <b>apparatus</b> and others using a conventional immersion technique...|$|R

40|$|Composite materials, {{including}} Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) bars, {{have been}} used for decades in the structural and civil engineering sectors over traditional steel reinforcement. The main reasons for this are that FRP composites possess a number of advantages. They are non-corrosive, non-conductive, and lightweight and possess high longitudinal tensile strength. This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation into the effects of the use of glass FRP (GFRP) bars as internal reinforcement on the behaviour of concrete beams with high strength concrete (HSC) and ultra-high strength concrete (UHSC). Both static and dynamic (impact) behaviours of the beam have been investigated. Twelve GFRP reinforced concrete (RC) beams were designed, cast and tested. Six GFRP RC beams were tested under static loading (three point bending) to examine the failure modes, load carrying capacity, deflection and energy absorption capacities. The other six GFRP RC beams were tested under impact loading using a drop <b>hammer</b> <b>apparatus</b> at various levels of impact energy. It was found that the use of UHSC in conjunction with larger amounts of tensile reinforcement showed higher levels of post-cracking bending stiffness.

40|$|The {{beginning}} of road construction could be dated {{to the time}} of the Romans. With the advancement of technology from carriages pulled by two horses to vehicles with power equivalent to 100 horses, road development had to follow suit. The construction of modern highways did not begin until the late 19 th to early 20 th century. Developed countries are constantly faced with high maintenance cost of aging transportation highways. The growth of the motor vehicle industry and accompanying economic growth has generated a demand for safer, better performing, less congested highways. The growth of commerce, educational institutions, housing, and defense have largely drawn from government budgets in the past, making the financing of public highways a challenge. The multipurpose characteristics of highways, economic environment, and the advances in highway pricing technology are constantly changing. Therefore, the approaches to highway financing, management, and maintenance are constantly changing as well.
