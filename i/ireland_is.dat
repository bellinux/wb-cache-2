5|$|The {{relationship}} of MacIntyres in Scotland {{to those in}} <b>Ireland</b> <b>is</b> not entirely clear. Given {{the proximity of the}} two countries and the similarity of their languages, some Scottish MacIntyres undoubtedly settled in Ireland, mainly in Ulster.|$|E
5|$|Dublin Bay is {{the next}} {{sizeable}} inlet, while the eastern coast of <b>Ireland</b> <b>is</b> mostly uniform until Wexford Harbour {{at the mouth of}} the River Slaney.

5|$|<b>Ireland</b> <b>is</b> {{the third}} best seller European market of E85 flex-fuel vehicles, after Sweden and France. Bioethanol (E85) in <b>Ireland</b> <b>is</b> made from whey, a waste product of cheese manufacturing. The Irish {{government}} established several incentives, including a 50% discount in vehicle registration taxes (VRT), which {{can account for}} more than one third of the retail price of a new car in Ireland (around €6,500). The bioethanol element of the E85 fuel is excise-free for fuel companies, allowing retail prices to be low enough to offset the 25 per cent cut in fuel economy that E-85 cars offer, due to ethanol's lower energy content than gasoline. Also, the value added tax (VAT) on the fuel can also be claimed back. E-85 fuel is available across the country in more than 20 of Maxol service stations. In October 2005, the 1.8 Ford Focus FFV became the first flexible-fuel vehicle to be commercially sold in Ireland. Later Ford launched the C-max and the Mondeo flexifuel models. Saab and Volvo also have E85 models available.|$|E
5|$|It’s {{a deadly}} time {{in so many}} ways to be in a band; you can have so much control over your work if you’re clever; you can release it how and when you like and in our opinion, right now, <b>Ireland</b> <b>is</b> the healthiest it’s ever been in terms of talent and diversity.|$|E
5|$|Most British {{orders of}} chivalry {{cover the entire}} kingdom, but the three most exalted ones each pertain to one {{constituent}} country only. The Order of St Patrick, which pertains to <b>Ireland,</b> <b>is</b> the most junior of these three in precedence and age. Its equivalent in England, The Most Noble Order of the Garter, is the oldest order of chivalry in the United Kingdom, dating to the middle fourteenth century. The Scottish equivalent is The Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle, dating in its modern form to 1687.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} notable {{examples}} of Palladianism in <b>Ireland</b> <b>is</b> the Castletown House, near Dublin. Designed by the Italian architect Alessandro Galilei (1691–1737), it is perhaps the only Palladian house in Ireland to have been built with Palladio's mathematical ratios, {{and one of the}} three Irish mansions which claim to have inspired the design of the White House in Washington.|$|E
5|$|Politically, <b>Ireland</b> <b>is</b> {{divided between}} the Republic of Ireland (officially named Ireland), which covers five-sixths of the island, and Northern Ireland, {{which is part of}} the United Kingdom, in the {{northeast}} of the island. In 2011, the population of Ireland was about 6.4million, ranking it the second-most populous island in Europe after Great Britain. Just under 4.6million live in the Republic of Ireland and just over 1.8million live in Northern Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The Republic of <b>Ireland</b> <b>is</b> a {{parliamentary}} democracy {{based on the}} British model, with a written constitution and a popularly elected president who has mostly ceremonial powers. The government is headed by a prime minister, the Taoiseach, who is appointed by the President on the nomination of the lower house of parliament, the Dáil. Members of the government are chosen from both the Dáil and the upper house of parliament, the Seanad. Its capital is Dublin.|$|E

5|$|The Romans {{would later}} refer to Ireland by this name too in its Latinised form, Hibernia, or Scotia. Ptolemy records sixteen nations inhabiting {{every part of}} Ireland in 100 CE. The {{relationship}} between the Roman Empire and the kingdoms of ancient <b>Ireland</b> <b>is</b> unclear. However, a number of finds of Roman coins have been made, for example at the Iron Age settlement of Freestone Hill near Gowran and Newgrange.|$|E
5|$|The geology of <b>Ireland</b> <b>is</b> diverse. Different regions contain rocks {{belonging}} to different geologic periods, dating {{as far back}} almost 2 billion years. The oldest known Irish rock is about 1.7 billion years old and is found on Inishtrahull Island off the north coast of Inishowen and on the mainland at Annagh Head on the Mullet Peninsula. The newer formations are the drumlins and glacial valleys {{as a result of}} the last ice age, and the sinkholes and cave formations in the limestone regions of Clare.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, <b>Ireland</b> <b>is</b> {{subdivided}} into four provinces: Connacht (west), Leinster (east), Munster (south), and Ulster (north). In {{a system that}} developed between the 13th and 17th centuries, Ireland has 32 traditional counties. Twenty-six of these counties are in the Republic of Ireland and six are in Northern Ireland. The six counties that constitute Northern Ireland {{are all in the}} province of Ulster (which has nine counties in total). As such, Ulster is often used as a synonym for Northern Ireland, although the two are not coterminous.|$|E

2500|$|In 2013, <b>Ireland</b> <b>was</b> {{named the}} [...] "best country for business" [...] by Forbes. Ireland exited its EU-IMF bailout {{programme}} on 15 December 2013.

Since then, <b>Ireland</b> has <b>been</b> able to sell long term bonds at record rates.|$|R
50|$|The first {{postal orders}} to <b>be</b> issued in <b>Ireland</b> <b>were</b> British postal orders issued on 1 January 1881. At this time, <b>Ireland</b> <b>was</b> {{part of the}} United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. This lasted until 1922.|$|R
5|$|An area {{in which}} the island {{operates}} as a single market is electricity. For much of their existence electricity networks in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were entirely separate. Both networks were designed and constructed independently post partition. However, as a result of changes over recent years they are now connected with three interlinks and also connected through Great Britain to mainland Europe. The situation in Northern <b>Ireland</b> <b>is</b> complicated by the issue of private companies not supplying Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) with enough power. In the Republic of Ireland, the ESB has failed to modernise its power stations and the availability of power plants has recently averaged only 66%, one of the worst such rates in Western Europe. EirGrid is building a HVDC transmission line between Ireland and Great Britain with a capacity of 500 MW, about 10% of Ireland's peak demand.|$|E
5|$|Baggio {{played in}} 16 World Cup matches for Italy; the Republic of <b>Ireland</b> <b>is</b> the only nation against {{which he played}} more than once. He is the highest Italian goalscorer of all-time in the World Cup, with nine goals, {{alongside}} Paolo Rossi and Christian Vieri. Baggio is the only Italian to have scored in three World Cups (two goals in 1990, five in 1994 and two in 1998). Three of his World Cup goals were scored in the group stage and six were scored during knockout matches. Baggio is the joint fourth-highest scorer for Italy with 27 goals in 56 appearances, with a 0.48 goal per match average. With Baggio, Italy was always eliminated from the World Cup in penalty shootouts: in 1990, in the semi-finals against Argentina; in 1994, in the final against Brazil; and in 1998, in the quarter-finals against France. In his 16 world cup matches, Italy lost only one, the opening game of USA 94.|$|E
5|$|City {{status in}} <b>Ireland</b> <b>is</b> decided by {{legislative}} or royal charter. Dublin, with over 1 million {{residents in the}} Greater Dublin Area, is the largest city on the island. Belfast, with 579,726 residents, is the largest city in Northern Ireland. City status does not directly equate with population size. For example, Armagh, with 14,590 is {{the seat of the}} Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Primate of All Ireland and was re-granted city status by Queen Elizabeth II in 1994 (having lost that status in local government reforms of 1840). In the Republic of Ireland, Kilkenny, seat of the Butler dynasty, while no longer a city for administrative purposes (since the 2001 Local Government Act), is entitled by law to continue to use the description.|$|E
50|$|UHF takeup in <b>Ireland</b> <b>was</b> {{slower than}} in the UK. A written answer in the Dáil Éireann (Irish parliament) shows that even by mid 1988 <b>Ireland</b> <b>was</b> onlytransmitting on UHF from four main {{transmitters}} and 11 relays.|$|R
50|$|In 1800 {{under the}} Acts of Union 1800, <b>Ireland</b> <b>was</b> {{politically}} unified with Britain {{to form the}} United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.
