50|$|Like most {{traditional}} smokers, early pellet grills {{were limited to}} indirect cooking methods such as smoking, roasting, and baking. However, thanks to improvements in construction and advancements in digital controllers, modern pellet grills can produce higher temperatures. Whereas early units struggled to reach 450 °F, some pellet grills can now easily achieve temperatures in excess of 550 °F. Louisiana Grills, Fast Eddy's by Cookshack, and Yoder Smokers YS Series have pellet grills with an upper limit of 600 °F. Some pellet grills can reach 600-700 °F, depending on the model. The ability to achieve high temperatures has enabled some manufacturers to design pellet grills that can handle both indirect and <b>direct</b> <b>cooking.</b> Brands such as Memphis Wood Fire Grills, Fast Eddy’s by Cookshack, Louisiana Grills, Yoder Smokers, and FireCraft make pellet grills that offer the option of open fire grilling.31 This is usually accomplished through a removable or adjustable plate that allows flames through {{a portion of the}} pellet grill's deflector plate.|$|E

Hence, it is essential to look for cheap and best method which can be adopted easily at home, thus keeping the requirement in mind, a study was planned to evaluate certain methods for removal of pesticide residues from tomato. Ripe tomato fruits (fresh, undamaged, stalks removed) were divided into lots, and each lot was dipped in 0. 2 % insecticide solutions (dimethoate, Methylparathion, profenophos, endosulfan) separately for 5 minutes and air dried on clean surface.

40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{of the effect}} of freezing followed by thawing (air and water immersion, both at environmental temperature) and cooking (traditional boiling in a covered pot) on quality profile (in terms of objective texture, colour, chlorophylls and pheophytins and sensory attributes) and structure of green beans (cv. Win). Freezing was carried out at three different rates by forced convection with liquid nitrogen vapour. Kramer shear cell (KSC) and Warner-Bratzler (WB) tests were used for objective assessment of the texture. The highest parameter values occurred in beans frozen at the highest rate and air-thawed at the slowest rate. Also, minimum alteration of the rheological behaviour of cooked beans was achieved by freezing at the highest rate. The best parameter for assessing the texture of frozen green beans after thawing and cooking was the Warner-Bratzler slope (S WB). Coefficients of softening estimated for S WB in the thawed beans showed that the texture of the beans frozen at - 24 °C was almost four and almost five times softer than that of the beans frozen at - 70 °C, for air and water thawing respectively. Frozen and thawed green beans were darker than fresh control, whereas freezing prior to cooking produced lighter-coloured beans than <b>direct</b> <b>cooking.</b> The freezing rate affected colour parameters differently depending on the process that followed. When beans were thawed, increasing the freezing rate produced lighter-coloured beans, whereas when beans were cooked, increasing the rate produced darker-coloured beans. No difference was found in sensory assessments between cooked samples frozen at - 24 °C, - 35 °C and - 70 °C, which probably reflects the panellists' mixed preferences for quickly and slowly frozen samples. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed different degrees of mechanical damage to tissue structure, which accounted for the rheological behaviour of the beans. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} waxy corn starch (WCS) on the texture, water-holding {{capacity}} and microstructure of sardine (Sardina pilchardus) surimi gels {{in two different}} systems was studied. In the type A system, increasing amounts of WCS (2, 4, 6 or 8 g/ 100 g surimi) were added to surimi while maintaining the gel moisture constant at 78 %; in the type B system, WCS was added without correcting the gel moisture. Gels were made using two different heat treatments [heat-induced setting (HS) and <b>direct</b> <b>cooking</b> (DC) ]. When starch was replaced by surimi (type A) and a heat treatment was applied that favoured formation of a preliminary actomyosin (AM) network (i. e. HS), gel strength (GS) was lower than in the control and decreased as more starch was added, despite {{an increase in the}} amount of water held by the gel. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the matrix network was fibrillar with a globular surface. Starch appeared to be totally gelatinized and surrounded by a continuous matrix. When the amount of dry matter in gels was increased (type B), in no case did starch have a reinforcing effect, despite an increasing water-holding capacity; SEM showed a denser continuous matrix surrounding the gelatinized starch. Both types of gel made using the heat treatment that allows simultaneous gelling of surimi and gelatinization of starch (i. e. DC) exhibited much poorer GS than did HS gels, while addition of starch made practically no difference to gel texture. The findings suggest that the effect of starch is related to the type of gel matrix that forms upon addition of ingredients. Although such gels contained more water or dry matter, their texture parameters were lower, possibly because of the type of network formed by sardine surimi. Nonetheless, gels of acceptable quality were successfully made with added starch by incorporating less surimi. © Springer-Verlag 1997 [...] This research was financed partly by the CICyT (Spain), through projects ALI 91 - 0927 -CO 2 - 01 and AL 191 - 0899 -CO 3 - 01, and partly by the European Community under project CE-FAR UP 1 216.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{development}} of new common bean cultivars with grain characteristics that achieve greater acceptance by consumers and faster cooking time is a recent trend in bean breeding programs. This study aimed at evaluating whether different common bean lines exhibit differences in grain morphological traits and cooking time, investigating the linear relationships between these traits and cooking time, and selecting lines with superior grain commercial characteristics and faster cooking times. A randomized blocks design with three replications was used. Treatments consisted of 14 common bean genotypes grown during two seasons. Differences in the mass of 100 grains and grain length, width, thickness, shape, flatness, percentage of water uptake and cooking time were observed between lines. A high positive correlation was observed between grain thickness and cooking time (r = 0. 9727). The path analysis revealed that grain thickness had the highest positive <b>direct</b> effect on <b>cooking</b> time (0. 62). Therefore, fast-cooking common bean lines can be indirectly selected based on lower grain thicknesses.

In the course of his preparation for the rôle of chef, which he had played both in France and America, he had made a specialty of edible fungi; and the result was that Anatole was set to mushrooming, and up to this moment he has discovered no less than six species hitherto unknown to the Altrurian table. This has added to their dietary in several important particulars, the fungi he has discovered being among those highly decorative and extremely poisonous-looking sorts which flourish in the deep woods and offer themselves almost inexhaustibly in places near the ruins of the old capitalistic cities, where hardly any other foods will grow.

50|$|The main {{explanation}} for burnt mounds {{is that they}} were cooking sites. However, there are problems with such explanations, {{not the least of which}} is the lack of any <b>direct</b> evidence of <b>cooking.</b> The process undoubtedly works; experiments were carried out in Ireland in the 1950s to show that a joint of meat could be fully cooked in about three to four hours through this method. However, bone is rarely if ever reported from burnt mound sites, which would be unusual for a cooking site. This has been explained as the result of the soils being too acidic for the bone to be preserved, but this is unsatisfactory. It would be rather unlikely that all of the soils relating to burnt mounds were so acidic that no bone survived, particularly as the pH of the soil will vary considerably from site to site. However, there are examples of burnt mounds that have been recorded on neutral or basic soils, without bone being apparent in the burnt mound material, Alternatives that have been suggested include saunas (where the intention is to create steam rather than cook anything), fulling, salt production, leather preparation etc.|$|R
30|$|Because the {{existing}} radiant floor heating panel {{can be used}} as the radiant cooling panel, it has been determined that a radiant floor cooling panel for space cooling should be adopted for every thermal zone (each room). For the supplementary cooling equipment with dehumidification, installation in every room may lead to sufficient dehumidification and supplementary cooling, but this may be unreasonable in terms of cost, system control, maintenance, and required area, because of the multi-zone space. In Korea, most occupants’ activities are mainly carried out in the living room, and the doors of rooms connected to the living room are often left open. In addition, while bedrooms are mainly used during bedtime and have a relatively low latent load, a living room may have substantial latent load, because of the <b>direct</b> influence of <b>cooking,</b> laundry, and drying, as well as its proximity to the bathroom. Thus, it has been determined that supplementary cooling equipment with dehumidification should be installed in a representative room, such as a living room, rather than being installed in every room.

6000|$|I {{was quite}} bewildered, and I don't {{know what to}} say I was the next thing, when I saw that the {{stranded}} yacht was flying the American flag from her peak. I supposed she must be one of our cruisers, she was so large, and the first thing that flashed into my mind was a kind of amused wonder what those poor Altrurians would do with a ship-of-war and her marines and crew. I couldn't ask any coherent questions, and luckily Aristides was answering my incoherent ones in the best possible way by wheeling our van down on the beach and making for the point nearest the yacht. He had time to say he did not believe she was a government vessel, and, in fact, I remembered that once I had seen a boat in the North River getting up steam to go to Europe which was much larger, and had her decks covered with sailors that I took for bluejackets; but she was only the private yacht of some people I knew. These stupid things kept going and coming in my mind while my husband was talking with some of the Altrurian girls who were there helping with the men. They said that the yacht had gone ashore the night before last in one of the sudden fogs that come up on that coast, and that some people whom the sailors seemed to obey were camping {{on the edge of the}} upland above the beach, under a large tent they had brought from the yacht. They had refused to go to the guest-house in the nearest village, and as nearly as the girls could make out they expected the yacht to get afloat from tide to tide, and then intended to re-embark on her. In the mean time they had provisioned themselves from the ship, and were living in a strange way of their own. Some of them seemed to serve the others, but these appeared to be used with a very ungrateful indifference, as if they were of a different race. There was one who wore a white apron and white cap who <b>directed</b> the <b>cooking</b> for the rest, and had several assistants; and from time to time very disagreeable odors came from the camp, like burning flesh. The Altrurians had carried them fruits and vegetables, but the men-assistants had refused them contemptuously and seemed suspicious of the variety of mushrooms they offered them. They called out, [...] "To-stoo!" [...] and I understood that the strangers were afraid they were bringing toad-stools. One of the Altrurian girls had been studying English in the nearest capital, and she had tried to talk with these people, pronouncing it in the Altrurian way, but they could make nothing of one another; then she wrote down what she wanted to say, but as she spelled it phonetically they were not able to read her English.

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Florestal e dos Recursos Naturais - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaIn {{industrial}} activities, {{the performance}} and the producibility of the final product manufactured, depends on interstices and extrinsic factors of the industrial production cycle. In order to optimize the production cycle, first should be analyze and account the based resource of the transformation procedure, which is the raw material base that leads the market made in each industry. The availability and supply of raw materials for initial conversion, largely defines the productive capacity of an industrial cycle, along with the monitoring technology defendant, as well the precision manufacturing methods and specialized equipment to determine quality and yield of the final product. In this context the production of pulp for paper {{is a part of}} industrial sector, also with extremely important analytical parameters in all the circuit of manufacturing. The following work is an analysis of consumption capacity and conversion, of raw material based on pulp and paper industry, this is the wood of Eucalyptus globulus, {{as one of the best}} chosen species for paper manufacture. The efficiency of the industrial cycle, necessarily begins with the constant supply and receiving of the primary product processing, timber, this is where is determined the daily production capacity and the turn in profitability of the final product, pulp. The analysis of the profitability of eucalyptus wood at an industrial level, was determined by quantification and inventory of the main percentage losses in the processing of roundwood in pulp, in peeling, chipping and Kraft processes in a factory of Portucel Soporcel in Setubal. For the same purpose, were analyzed each transformation process manufacturing employment, in order to delineate how and where does the losses procedural associated belong, as well as the mechanism of the receiving system and supply of wood in roundwood with bark Eucalyptus globulus, as the initial and primary flow of processing industries. The definition of the main objectives of producibility and profitability of the industrial cycle plants, to meet the needs and demands of the trading market, depend on the ability to supply the raw material for converting the initial factory. In this way, is necessary to maintain an influent receiving wood and precise quantification of the industrial entry. Quantification methods of reception and production of a product, which may be more stringent, in industrial scale are constantly monitored and evaluated in order to detect the limitations and inaccuracies that can be improved or even eliminated if interfere in the accuracy of measurement daily production capacity of manufacturing. So throughout the study in question, were determined the error margins associated in each method of quantification of reception, as well in the determination of losses and production of pulp from Eucalyptus globulus wood, prepared in different ways throughout the process analysis. The margin of error was determined calculating the average error of each measurement made, using records of system measurement and quantification defendant, using the m 3 standard as the volume unit of the process of industrial measurement adopted. Using the theory of propagation of errors in all weights and samples made in the inventory of the main and side timber flows, was associated a error of 2. 76 % for a cubic meter of wood in the quantification by the method of immersion in water, ± 20 kg the margin of error of reading made in weighing the side streams and ± 0. 001 kg in weighing samples. The main procedural losses of wood were identified on the flow of processed bark peeling, mechanic performed by a rotating drum. For greater accuracy, were analyzed the two-line debarking industrial, by selecting identical time bases of four hours on average, and collecting four samples with about 5 kg of bark along the processing, at the end, on average there were about 5 % losses in wood taken from the bark peeling in each line. Carried out on different days receptionist wood, on each line analyzed in duplicate, was noted that in days of heavy rainfall and especially in finer flows of roundwood, losses in mechanical processing chips were the most highlighted, revealing the section shelling the area, the greatest percentage loss of timber industry. With about 1 % on average in each line peel, chips of shattered dimensions too thin for processing pulp, represent the second procedural losses in mechanical processing of roundwood into chips to Kraft cooking. The resulting wood of procedural losses in the plant in question, are use as biomass, converted into green energy that is self consumption and sold by the industrial core analyzed. Once converted into chips for paper pulp production, wood is <b>directed</b> to <b>cooking,</b> screening and bleaching through the process of Kraft delignification. Lignin removed through the black liquor, is recycled for conversion of biomass and green energy, while the liquor is bleach to white liquor, in recovered for reuse in other pulping processes. In the Kraft process is defined a yield of 52 % of wood for Kraft pulp production, the main losses of processed wood are revealed in the content of knots and uncooked shives, riddled sequentially and removed from the production system, due the unfit features for industrial purpose. The knots and uncooked shives were determined by inventory and final weights, on the end of the industrial cycle production of pulp in similar conditions and temporal basis. Being carried out six tests and sampling weights, we can conclude that the knots and uncooked shives represent about 1, 5 % of the wood processed in Kraft pulp. In the end, it was concluded on average, about 6 % wood losses along the industrial processing of roundwood Eucalyptus globulus into chips for paper pulp production and 1, 5 % in pulping, mainly represented by the wood-drag carried by the bark, then the knots and uncooked shives content riddled and finally the chips due the size too thin called “sawdust”...|$|R
