[...] One editor, highlighting the technical simplicity of Lawson's recipes, noted that [...] "her dishes require none of the elaborate preparation called for by most TV chefs".|$|E

500|$|The {{cover was}} controversial; {{editions of the}} album sold at Circuit City came housed in a {{cardboard}} sleeve featuring an alternate cover, while Walmart and Kmart refused to stock the album at all. A pastor in Memphis, Tennessee threatened {{to go on a}} hunger strike unless the album was pulled from shelves. Manson described these actions as attempts at censorship: [...] "The irony <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> point of the photo on the album was to show people that the crucifixion of Christ is, indeed, a violent image. My jaw is missing as a symbol of this very kind of censorship. This doesn't piss me off as much as it pleases me, because those offended by my album cover have successfully proven my point."

500|$|Between Klute in 1971 and Fun With Dick and Jane in 1977, Fonda did {{not have}} a major film success. She {{appeared}} in A Doll's House (1973), Steelyard Blues and The Blue Bird (1976). From comments ascribed to her in interviews, some have inferred that she personally blamed the situation on anger at her outspoken political views: [...] "I can't say I was blacklisted, but I was greylisted." [...] However, in her 2005 autobiography, My Life So Far, she rejected such simplification. [...] "The suggestion is that because of my actions against the war my career had been destroyed ... But the truth <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> career, far from being destroyed after the war, flourished with a vigor it had not previously enjoyed." [...] She reduced acting because of her political activism providing a new focus in her life. Her return to acting in a series of 'issue-driven' films reflected this new focus.|$|E
500|$|Designed by Daigo Ikeno, Rufus was {{initially}} {{intended to be}} a bald slender black male wearing a gi named [...] "King Cobra", meant to be a more acrobatic counterpart to series characters Ryu and Ken and voiced by Wataru Hatano. His fighting style was intended to be [...] "breakung-fu", mixing elements of Chinese martial arts with breakdancing, which they perceived as a fad in the United States at the time, and Ikeno developed the character's concept around it. Midway through the process of recording the character's lines, however, art director Takashi Kamei proposed that they have the character be overweight, an idea Ikeno agreed with. As a result, the design was gradually changed completely, becoming more obese and turned into a blonde, long haired white male, a design which Ikeno later admitted was in fact rushed. The changed appearance surprised many of Capcom's staff members, including Hatano, who remarked [...] "Wait, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> character?" [...] Rufus final appearance was chosen over his initial design because the developers felt he would [...] "freak people out". Street Fighter IVs executive producer Yoshinori Ono likened his inclusion to that of Blanka in Street Fighter II, noting that Rufus' [...] "over-the-top" [...] design was intended to help set the game apart from the [...] "really cool-looking but ultimately bland" [...] characters of Tekken and Virtua Fighter.|$|E

It was if there was some unfinished business, some sort of mix-up, something I never understood. It's a mystery." [...] Moore believes the site may be near the Welsh Harp reservoir – also known as Brent Reservoir – in north London. By chance, what {{is believed to have been}} the first cycle race in Britain took place at the Welsh Harp the day after Moore won in the Parc de St-Cloud. The race was won by Arthur Markham, who for many years had a bicycle shop nearby at 345 Edgware Road.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{his career}} as a journalist, Travis {{produced}} numerous comprehensive and detailed golf instructional essays. [...] Given the reputation he earned as an outstanding putter, it was natural that many of his articles dealt with his well-proven principles of putting. [...] In one of his earliest articles, Travis wrote [...] "The sum of it all <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> experience shows conclusively that the really good putter is largely born, not made, and is inherently endowed with a good eye and a tactile delicacy of grip which are denied the ordinary run of mortals. [...] At the same time, less favored players may, by the adoption of methods which stood the test of actual experience, materially improve their game." [...] His effectiveness as an instructor was demonstrated in the following example: ...|$|E

2500|$|Mobutu {{also had}} a cordial {{relationship}} with Reagan's successor, George H. W. Bush; {{he was the first}} African head of state to visit Bush at the White House. Even so, Mobutu's relationship with the US radically changed shortly afterward {{with the end of the}} Cold War. With the Soviet Union gone, there was no longer any reason to support Mobutu as a bulwark against communism. Accordingly, the US and other Western powers began pressuring Mobutu to democratize the regime. Regarding the change in US attitude to his regime, Mobutu bitterly remarked: [...] "I am the latest victim of the cold war, no longer needed by the US. The lesson <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> support for American policy counts for nothing." [...] In 1993, Mobutu was denied a visa by the US State Department after he sought to visit Washington, DC.|$|E
2500|$|Emerson had {{convinced}} a devastated Loos {{that he needed}} to take a break from his marriage once a week. It was on these days he would date younger women, while Loos consoled herself by entertaining her friends: the Talmadge sisters, Mama Peg Talmadge, Marion Davies, Marilyn Miller, Adele Astaire and an assortment of chorus girls kept by prominent men. These [...] "Tuesday Widows" [...] soireés would influence her later writings, and it was with the [...] "Tuesday Widows" [...] that she visited one of her favorite hangouts, Harlem, where she developed a deep and lifelong appreciation for African-American culture. [...] "Sometimes I get enquiries (sic) concerning my marriage to a man who treated me with complete lack of consideration, tried to take credit for my work and appropriated all my earnings", Loos wrote in Cast of Thousands.

My learned friend must not use words such as 'Communist' lightly, when he refers to Kantor. Kantor is not a Communist. My learned friend has used the tactics of McCarthyism in an endeavour to smear him. I think, with respect, my learned friend is allowing himself to run away with facts that are not there. His complaint in count one is not that they found files with evidence. Oh not, he says that 'we found files with nothing in them', not in Kantor's office, but in the office of Wolpe. Then my learned friend [...] that the practice had been ruined and liquidated Kantor's practice. My lord, it is not Kantor. It is not Kantor!

2500|$|In late 1958, {{having won}} 56 {{national}} and international singles and doubles titles, Gibson retired from amateur tennis. Prior to the Open Era there was no prize money at major tournaments, and direct endorsement deals were prohibited. Players were limited to meager expense allowances, strictly regulated by the USTA. [...] "The truth, to put it bluntly, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> finances were in heartbreaking shape," [...] she wrote. [...] "Being the Queen of Tennis is all well and good, but you can't eat a crown. Nor can you send the Internal Revenue Service a throne clipped to their tax forms. The landlord and grocer and tax collector are funny that way: they like cold cash ... I reign over an empty bank account, and I'm not going to fill it by playing amateur tennis." [...] Professional tours for women were still 15 years away, so her opportunities were largely limited to promotional events. [...] In 1959 she signed to play a series of exhibition matches against Karol Fageros before Harlem Globetrotter basketball games. When the tour ended she won the singles and doubles titles at the Pepsi Cola World Pro Tennis Championships in Cleveland, but received only $500 in prize money.|$|E
2500|$|On May 15, 1939, Antonina Pirozhkova {{was awakened}} by four NKVD agents {{pounding}} upon the door of their Moscow apartment. Although surprised, she agreed to accompany them to Babel's dacha in Peredelkino. Babel was then placed under arrest. According to Pirozhkova: [...] "In the car, {{one of the men}} sat in back with Babel and me while the other one sat in front with the driver. 'The worst part of this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> mother won't be getting my letters', and then he was silent for a long time. I could not say a single word. Babel asked the secret policeman sitting next to him, 'So I guess you don't get too much sleep, do you?' And he even laughed. As we approached Moscow, I said to Babel, 'I'll be waiting for you, it will be as if you've gone to Odessa... only there won't be any letters....' He answered, 'I ask you to see that the child not be made miserable.' [...] "But I don't know what my destiny will be." [...] At this point, the man sitting beside Babel said to me, [...] "We have no claims whatsoever against you." [...] We drove to the Lubyanka Prison and through the gates. The car stopped before the massive, closed door where two sentries stood guard. Babel kissed me hard and said, [...] "Someday we'll see each other..." [...] And without looking back, {{he got out of the}} car and went through that door.|$|E
2500|$|On December 21, 1898, President William McKinley {{issued a}} Proclamation of Benevolent Assimilation. Major General Elwell Stephen Otis—who was Military Governor of the Philippines at that time—delayed its publication. On January 4, 1899, General Otis {{published}} an amended version edited {{so as not}} to convey the meanings of the terms [...] "sovereignty", [...] "protection", and [...] "right of cessation" [...] which were present in the original version. However, Brigadier General Marcus Miller—then in Iloilo City and unaware that the altered version had been published by Otis—passed a copy of the original proclamation to a Filipino official there. The original proclamation then found its way to Aguinaldo who, on January 5, issued a counter-proclamation: [...] "My government cannot remain indifferent in view of such a violent and aggressive seizure of a portion of its territory by a nation which arrogated to itself the title of champion of oppressed nations. Thus it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> government is disposed to open hostilities if the American troops attempt to take forcible possession of the Visayan islands. I denounce these acts before the world, in order that the conscience of mankind may pronounce its infallible verdict as to who are true oppressors of nations and the tormentors of mankind. In a revised proclamation issued the same day, Aguinaldo protested [...] "most solemnly against this intrusion of the United States Government on the sovereignty of these islands". Otis regarded Aguinaldo's proclamations as tantamount to war, alerting his troops and strengthening observation posts. On the other hand, Aguinaldo's proclamations energized the masses with a vigorous determination to fight what was perceived as an ally turned enemy.|$|E
