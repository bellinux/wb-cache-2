This framework is used to show the strengths and limitations of existing answers, which motivates a new approach for dealing with this question. The paper derives simple, closed form approximations to the optimal level of government expenditure when an important part of government revenue is generated by an uncertain and <b>exhaustible</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> such as oil.

40|$|Many resource-rich {{countries}} have negative genuine saving rates, so deplete their <b>exhaustible</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> wealth {{faster than they}} build up wealth in other assets. This phenomenon is stronger in more fractionalized countries with poor legal systems. We explain this by a power struggle about the control of natural resources. Competing fractions in society thus have a private stock of financial assets and a common stock of natural resources. We solve a dynamic common-pool problem and obtain political economy variants of the Hotelling rule for resource depletion and the Hartwick saving rule necessary to sustain constant consumption in an economy with exhaustible natural resources. Resource depletion is faster than demanded by the Hotelling rule. As a result, the country has negative genuine saving rates and is running down its national wealth. The country saves more in financial assets than the current natural resource rents. Still, the erosion of natural wealth exceeds the accumulation of financial assets. Even though the power struggle boosts output, consumption is sub-optimally low. The highlighted political distortions are larger if the country is more fractionalized.

Secondly, in force of the Hotelling rule, some limitations are imposed to the dynamics of normal prices and, by implication, to technical and structural change.

This study examines the implications of such restriction on government land sales policy over the period when the restriction was in place. Using analytical tools for the depletion of an <b>exhaustible</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resource,</b> we can estimate an 'optimal control path' for land disposal in Hong Kong.

The implication is that the Hong Kong government will try to minimize wealth dissipation by adjusting its land sales policy. Given the 50 ha restriction, this can be achieved by (a) selling land lots with higher development density and (b) negotiating with the Sino-British Land Commission to relax the 50 ha limit from time to time. Both implications are consistent with empirical observations.

40|$|In Chapter 2 we {{extend the}} {{heterogeneous}} discounting model introduced in Marín-Solano and Patxot (2012) to a stochastic environment. Our main contribution {{in this chapter}} is to derive the DPE providing time-consistent solution for both the discrete and continuous time case. For the continuous time problem we derive the DPE following the two different procedures described above: the formal limiting procedure and the variational approach. However, an important limitation of these approaches is that the DPE obtained is a functional equation with a nonlocal term. As a consequence, it becomes very complicated to find solutions, not only analytically, but also numerically. For this reason, we also derive a set of two coupled partial differential equations which allows us to compute (analytically or numerically) the solutions for different economic problems. In particular, {{we are interested in}} analyzing how time-inconsistent preferences with heterogeneous discounting modify the classical consumption and portfolio rules (Merton (1971)). The introduction of stochastic terminal time is also discussed. In Chapter 3, the results of Chapter 2 are extended in several ways. First, we consider that the decision maker is subject to a mortality risk. Within this context, we derive the optimal consumption, investment and life insurance rules for an agent whose concern about both the bequest left to her descendants and her wealth at retirement increases with time. To this end we depart from the model in Pliska and Ye (2007) generalizing the individual time preferences by incorporating heterogeneous discount functions. In addition, following Kraft (2003), we derive the wealth process in terms of the portfolio elasticity with respect to the traded assets. This approach allows us to introduce options in the investment opportunity set as well as to enlarge it by any number of contingent claims while maintaining the analytical tractability of the model. Finally, we analyze how the standard solutions are modified depending on the attitude of the agent towards her changing preferences, showing the differences with some numerical illustrations. In Chapter 4 we extend the heterogeneous discount framework to the study of differential games with heterogeneous agents, i. e., agents who exhibit different instantaneous utility functions and different (but constant) discount rates of time preference. In fact, although the non-standard models have usually focused on individual agents, the framework has proved to be useful in the study of cooperative solutions for some standard discounting differential games. Our main contribution in this chapter is to provide a set of DPE in discrete and continuous time in order to obtain time-consistent cooperative solutions for $N$-person differential games with heterogeneous agents. The results are applied to the study of a cake eating problem describing the management of a common property <b>exhaustible</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resource.</b> The extension to a simple common renewable natural resource in infinite horizon is also discussed.

This paper {{argues that}} {{adjusted}} Net National Income (aNNI) rather than Gross Domestic Product (GDP) {{is the most}} appropriate measure of economic performance for a country with significant <b>exhaustible</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resources</b> and important foreign-‐investor presence.
