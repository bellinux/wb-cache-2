40|$|Anthropomorphic Attachments" {{undertakes}} {{an examination}} of the human as a highly nebulous, fluid, multiple, and often contradictory concept, one that cannot be approached directly or in isolation, but only in its constitutive relationality with the world. Rather than {{trying to find a way}} outside of the dualism between human and not-human, I take up the concept of anthropomorphization as a way to hypersaturate the question of the human. Within this hypersaturated field of inquiry, I focus on the specific anthropomorphic relationalities between human and <b>humanoid</b> <b>technology.</b> Focusing primarily on contemporary U. S. technologies and cultural forms, my dissertation looks at artificial intelligence and robotics in conversation with their cultural imaginaries in contemporary literature, science fiction, film, performance art, and video games, and in conversation with contemporary philosophies of the human, the posthuman, and technology. In reading these discourses as shaping, informing, and amplifying each other and the multiple conceptions of the human they articulate, "Anthropomorphic Attachments" attends to these multiple humans and the multiple morphologies by which anthropomorphic relationalities imagine and inscribe both humanoid technologies and the human itself.

40|$|A humanoid, {{which refers}} to a robot that resembles a human body, imitates a human’s intelligence, behavior, sense, and {{interaction}} {{in order to provide}} various types of services to human beings. Humanoids have been studied and developed constantly in order to improve their performance. Humanoids were previously developed for simple repetitive or hard work that required significant human power. However, intelligent service robots have been developed actively these days to provide necessary information and enjoyment; these include robots manufactured for home, entertainment, and personal use. It has become generally known that artificial intelligence <b>humanoid</b> <b>technology</b> will significantly benefit civilization. On the other hand, Successful Research and Development (R & D) on humanoids is possible only if they are developed in a proper direction in accordance with changes in markets and society. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze changes in technology markets and society for developing sustainable Management of Technology (MOT) strategies. In this study, patent data related to humanoids are analyzed by various data mining techniques, including topic modeling, cross-impact analysis, association rule mining, and social network analysis, to suggest sustainable strategies and methodologies for MOT...|$|E

This paper {{presents}} {{a vision of}} humanoid robots as human’s key partners in future space exploration, in particular for construction, maintenance/repair and operation of lunar/planetary habitats, bases and settlements. It integrates this vision with the recent plans for human and robotic exploration, aligning a set of milestones for operational capability of humanoids with the {{schedule for the next}} decades and development spirals in the Project Constellation. These milestones relate to a set of incremental challenges, for the solving of which new <b>humanoid</b> <b>technologies</b> are needed. A system of systems integrative approach that would lead to readiness of cooperating humanoid crews is sketched. Robot fostering, training/education techniques to enhance and in conjunction with cognitive/sensory/motor development techniques are considered essential elements for achieving intelligent humanoids.

50|$|The Scientific Plan 2009-2011 is the {{evolution}} of the 2005-2008 plan, which was dealing with a large scale program on Humanoid Robotics. According to the 2005-2008 strategic plan, the Humanoid Robotics program had a strong interdisciplinary character, merging human and <b>humanoid</b> <b>technologies</b> through the development of 3 technology platforms: Robotics, Neuroscience and Drug Discovery and Development (D3), supported by a few facilities for nano-biotechnologies (such as material science, nanofabrication, chemistry and biochemistry, electron microscopy laboratories etc.). Each platform was meant to develop specific topics/tasks in different IIT research units, such as the Departments built in Genoa, or, in some cases, the external research units forming the multidisciplinary research network of IIT country-wide.To date the research infrastructure of IIT in Genoa has been completed. It consists of more than 500 staff from 30 different countries, operating in a 25000 sqm facility equipped with state-of-the-art laboratories distributed over three Robotics departments (Robotics, Brain and Cognitive Sciences; Advanced Robotics; TeleRobotics and Applications) and two life-science oriented departments (Neuroscience and Brain Technologies, and Drug Discovery and Development, D3), and a few shared facilities including nanofabrication clean room, material science lab, chemistry lab, biochemistry lab, animal facility, electron microscopy, mechanical and electronic workshops. The growth of the Humanoid Robotic program at IIT is witnessed by the exceptional development of the iCub robot (see the movie below), which merges in a unique way the engineering, the neuroscience, and the material science know-how existing at the Institute.|$|R

40|$|Soft robots are robots made mostly or {{completely}} of soft, deformable, or compliant materials. As <b>humanoid</b> robotic <b>technology</b> {{takes on a}} wider range of applications, it has become apparent that they could replace humans in dangerous environments. Current attempts to create robotic hands for these environments are very difficult and costly to manufacture. Therefore, a robotic hand made with simplistic architecture and cheap fabrication techniques is needed. The goal of this thesis is to detail the design, fabrication, modeling, and testing of the SUR Hand. The SUR Hand is a soft, underactuated robotic hand designed to be cheaper and easier to manufacture than conventional hands. Yet, it maintains much of their dexterity and precision.

40|$|I discuss {{challenges}} and chances offered to cognitive psychology {{by the recent}} groundbreaking progress in <b>humanoid</b> robot <b>technology.</b> The focus is on three developments. First, the robots' humanoid appearance in combination with their cognitive capabilities facilitates intuitive interaction with users and causes strong anthropomorphism and encourages the systematic investigation of the human's "theory of robotic mind". Second, experimental investigation of {{interaction by means of}} systematic variation of robot behavior provides new approaches to investigate human behavior, which yield methodical challenges. Third, humanoid robots increasingly face similar learning and behavioral problems as humans and their performance can give insights into the structure of such problems. Finally, it has often been argued that compared to computational models robots provide an alternative way of understanding human behavior by means of synthesis of intelligent behavior. I argue that humanoid robots can provide testbeds for hypothesized models, but – regarded as models for cognition – face similar fundamental considerations in their validity from a point of view of philosophy of science as computational models in cognitive psychology do. ...|$|R
40|$|Q-learning is {{a simple}} and {{powerful}} tool in solving dynamic problems where environments are unknown. It uses a balance of exploration and exploitation to find an optimal solution to the problem. In this paper, we propose using four basic emotions: joy, sadness, fear, and anger to influence a Qlearning agent. Simulations show that the proposed affective agent requires lesser number of steps to find the optimal path. We found when affective agent finds the optimal path, the ratio between exploration to exploitation gradually decreases, indicating lower total step count in the long runComment: 7 pages, Badoy, W. and Teknomo, K.

40|$|With the {{development}} of <b>technology,</b> <b>humanoid</b> robots gradually enter our life, not only for education, but helping people with housework and many other tasks, {{some of which are}} inevitable for human.

So a human-robot interactive demonstration system is designed to help non-expert users to control the humanoid robot, Aldebaran humanoid robot Nao in this case. Users just need to use the most natural body gestures to interact with the robot. Microsoft Kinect is applied in this system to recognize different body gestures and generate visual Human-Robot interaction interface, then the controlling signals of different body gesture modules are sent to Nao through wifi, which can stimulate Nao to complete tasks.

40|$|Since robots {{have become}} part of human life, several studies have been done with the aim of {{discovering}} salient social rules at the basis of the collaboration between human beings and humanoid robot (Human Humanoid Interaction - HHI). The purpose is to have a common environment where human and humanoid robot could engage a proficous "dialogue" in order to share the "sense of co-presence" for common empathic tasks and goals. The humanoid robot must {{be in a position to}} interact with the human, and learn day by day from external environment, exactly as it occurs in human beings in the real life. In this sense, significant progresses have been reached, having a strong impact in each aspect of every day life. In this way, is a big challenge having a humanoid robot that can exhibit a natural and empathic interaction with human beings, supporting a pseudo-realistic conversation and expressing human-like body emotions. To reach this ambitious goal, it was essentially conducted a sociological and psychological study (Sorbello et al., 2014) oriented to investigating collaborative and social features related to human robot interaction. So, supported by the results of this study it was possible to base all assumptions that support the design of the robust robotic architecture in order to reach the purposes of this thesis. The Sociological and Psychological study aims at a descriptive analysis of the main perceptual and social features of natural conditions of agents interaction, which can be specified by agents in human-humanoid robot interaction. A principled approach to human-robot interaction may be assumed to comply with the natural conditions of agents overt perceptual and social behaviour. To validate this research a minimalistic humanoid robot Telenoid it was used and human-robot interactions test have been conducted with two hundred people with no prior interaction experience with robot. After the definition of experimental conditions and setup, an analysis of significant variance correlation among dimensions in ordinary and goal guided contexts of interaction has been performed in order to prove that Perception and Believability are indicators of social interaction, that can increase the degree of interaction in human-humanoid interaction. I found that the sense of a shared environment is substantive for obtaining iv a satisfying interaction, where the distances between agents are constructed as perceptual-motor proxies of the regions where intentions and actions are available at a glance. The experimental results highlight that the Perceptual and Believability, as implicit social competences, could improve the meaningfulness and the natural- like sense of human-humanoid interaction in every day life task-driven activities and the Telenoid robot is perceived as an autonomous cooperative agent for a shared environment with human beings. One crucial result of my doctoral research is that subjects are significantly inclined to perceive the Telenoid as cooperative and competent even though this favorableness. Since the users perceived the behaviour of the Telenoid coherent and consistent, my results suggest that they are favourably incline to accept the humanoids behaviour as tuned to theirs and moved by the commitment to meet their demands. The idea of social robots, able to engage users for extended periods of time, received great attention from researchers in the recent years. In particular, in HHI, empathy is a important key in order to overcome the current limitations of social robots. In facts, a main defining characteristic of human social behavior is empathy. I support the hypothesis that the robots, in order to become personal companions or partners of our daily life in the near future, they need to know how to interact with us by means of empathy. One of the subgoal of this thesis is to overcome the state of loneliness of elderly people (understanding in which emphatic state is based the current HHI) using this minimalistic humanoid robot capable to exhibit a dialogue similar to what usually happens in real life between human beings. To validate my research, I have designed and developed a robotic architecture using the minimalistic humanoid robot Telenoid and I have conducted human- robot interactions tests with elderly people with no prior interaction experience with robot. During the experiments, elderly persons engaged a stimulated conversation with the humanoid robot. In order to engage a sort of empathic state in HHI, is necessary to catch the emotions that arise by conversation, so that, the humanoid robot can be able to interact socially and naturally with a human by expressing human-like body emotions in according with his interlocutor. The emotional architecture designed is based on an emotional conceptual space generated using the paradigm of Latent Semantic Analysis. The robot generates its overall affective behavior (Latent Semantic Behavior) taking into account the visual and phrasal stimuli of human user, the environment and his "personality", all encoded in his emotional conceptual space. The robot determines his emotion in according by all these parameters that influence and orient the generation of his behavior not predictable from the user. The goal of this approach is to obtain an affinity matching with humans. The robot, in this way, can exhibit a smoothly natural transition in his emotion, changing during the interaction with humans taking, also, into account the previous generated emotions. To validate the system, I implemented a distribute system on an Telenoid robot and on a Google Android Phone and I tested this social emotional interaction using the phone device as intelligent interface between human and robot in a complex scenario. The favourable acceptance of Telenoid behaviors by human users had oriented the research to the use of this android robot as: •	Therapist on the processes of Social Integration among Children with DSA and their classmates. In particular I am interested in the study related to the sense of a person to be present in a remote environment with a robot ("Telepresence") and to the sense of a child to be present in a common environment with a robot where humans and humanoid are "accessible, available and subject to one another" (Goffman, 1966). The sense of "togetherness" between persons and Humanoid is "inherently social" (Biocca, 1992) and is highly connected with the concepts of particular behavior defined "sensible" (Chella et al., 2011 a) because capable to express cognitive functionality. 2 ̆ 028 Priority goals of the study are: to gain greater flexibility and expressivity of mime and gaze in social interaction, learning the shifts and exchange in reciprocity, the refinement of verbal interaction and non-verbal, acquisition of skills and insights to make inferences about to view of the other, the possibility of developing the semantics and pragmatics of language areas of major weakness. The individual profile, of autistic child, make possible the use of autonomous robots with a remote control by the therapist. In order to test the relevance and the goals, I conducted experiments with 2 autistic children, 23 classmates and telenoid and nao robots. •	Co-therapist for the parents of children with autism for the acceptance of diversity. Many existing research studies have shown good results relating to the important impact of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) (Prevedini et al., 2011) applied to parents of children with autism. The ACT has in Relation Frame Theory (RFT) its theoretical foundation. The overall behaviors of the parents may potentially benefit from treatment with a humanoid robot therapist instead of a real one. In particular in the present study, Telenoid humanoid robot (Ishiguro et al., 2013) is used as therapist to achieve a specific therapeutic objective: the acceptance of diversity from the parents of children with autism. Experimental results has been conducted adapting Hexaflex model of ACT protocol to Telenoid Robot in the therapy with parents. I conducted the preliminary test with 2 parents of autistic children and the humanoid robot Telenoid. •	"Alter Ego"and "Partner" of the Locked-In patients affected by Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis through the use of devices BCI (Brain Computer Interface).

In particular, I do expect that a humanoid robot may act in different dimensions as motor substitution, virtual moving, shooting and emotional interaction and communications proxy interlocutor. I conducted the preliminary test with 2 locked-in patients and the Telenoid and nao robots (Experiments sessions have been supervised by psychologists) and I want to verify with this preliminary test whether this approach might improves the quality of life and disease status acceptance of patients and caregivers...|$|R
