5|$|Section 4 of the Act {{includes}} new {{provisions to}} cover this sort of situation. Section 4(1) establishes a general duty to repair and maintain the property, owed by the landlord to anyone who could reasonably {{be expected to be}} <b>harmed</b> <b>by</b> a breach; this includes tenants, their friends and family and also trespassers. This duty applies when a landlord ought to have known of a defect, not just when he has been informed of a defect. Additionally, a landlord who merely has the right to repair property rather than an obligation to do so may still be found liable, if one of the groups described in Section 4 was <b>harmed</b> <b>by</b> their failure to repair.|$|E

5|$|Doug Wickenheiser was {{selected}} by Montreal with the first pick at the 1980 NHL Entry Draft. The decision was highly controversial as the fans in Montreal had hoped the team would take francophone star Denis Savard. Wickenheiser's transition to the NHL was difficult; his popularity was <b>harmed</b> <b>by</b> comparisons of his struggles to Savard's immediate success with the Black Hawks. He {{was traded to the}} Blues midway through the 1983–84 season.|$|E
5|$|Gustavo, {{voiced by}} Alejandro Edda, {{is a minor}} {{antagonist}} in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End where he appears fighting Nate in prison. He and his gang later ambush Nate, Sam and Rafe after they examine a St. Dismas Cross which Nate found. He is however interrupted by the prison guards and beaten to death by Vargas, who was bribed by the treasure hunters in protecting them from being <b>harmed</b> <b>by</b> other inmates.|$|E

When exposed to oil, these organisms suffer 90%-plus mortality and recovery of the population can take decades.|$|E
5|$|Sherman's {{second term}} also saw his first speeches in Congress on the country's {{financial}} situation, {{which had been}} <b>harmed</b> <b>by</b> the Panic of 1857. Citing the need to pare unnecessary expenditures in light of diminished revenue, Sherman especially criticized Southern senators for adding appropriations to the House's bills. His speech attracted attention and {{was the start of}} Sherman's focus on financial matters, which would continue throughout his long political career.|$|E

40|$|Criminal law (known as penal law) is {{the branch}} of law that deals with crime, criminals and the legal {{punishment}} of criminal offenses. Penal law is intended {{to protect the public}} from <b>harm</b> <b>by</b> inflicting punishment upon those who have already done <b>harm</b> and <b>by</b> threatening with punishment those who can to do harm. Criminal law also often tries to avoid <b>harm</b> <b>by</b> forbidding conduct that may lead to harmful results. It involves prosecution by the government of a person for a crime.

5|$|An {{analysis}} of chemicals {{present in the}} island's soil, together with resolutions passed by Guam's legislature, suggest that Agent Orange was among the herbicides routinely used on and around military bases Anderson Air Force Base, Naval Air Station Agana, Guam. Despite the evidence, the Department of Defense continues to deny that Agent Orange was ever stored or used on Guam. Several Guam veterans have collected {{an enormous amount of}} evidence to assist in their disability claims for direct exposure to dioxin containing herbicides such as 2,4,5-T which are similar to the illness associations and disability coverage that has become standard for those who were <b>harmed</b> <b>by</b> the same chemical contaminant of Agent Orange used in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Caligula's first acts {{were said}} to be generous in spirit, though many were {{political}} in nature. To gain support, he granted bonuses to the military, including the Praetorian Guard, city troops and the army outside Italy. He destroyed Tiberius's treason papers, declared that treason trials were a thing of the past, and recalled those who had been sent into exile. He helped those who had been <b>harmed</b> <b>by</b> the imperial tax system, banished certain sexual deviants, and put on lavish spectacles for the public, including gladiatorial games. Caligula collected and brought back the bones of his mother and of his brothers and deposited their remains in the tomb of Augustus.|$|E

5|$|Feminist {{campaigns are}} {{generally}} considered to be a main force behind major historical societal changes for women's rights, particularly in the West, where they are near-universally credited with achieving women's suffrage, gender neutrality in English, reproductive rights for women (including access to contraceptives and abortion), and the right to enter into contracts and own property. Although feminist advocacy is, and has been, mainly focused on women's rights, some feminists, including bell hooks, argue for the inclusion of men's liberation within its aims because men are also <b>harmed</b> <b>by</b> traditional gender roles.|$|E
5|$|Ficus aurea is {{a fast-growing}} tree. As a hemi{{epiphyte}} it germinates in {{the canopy of}} a host tree and begin life as an epiphyte before growing roots down to the ground. F. aurea is also a strangler fig (not all hemiepiphytic figs are stranglers)—the roots fuse and encircle the host tree. This usually results {{in the death of}} the host tree, since it effectively girdles the tree. Palms, which lack secondary growth, are not affected by this, but they can still be <b>harmed</b> <b>by</b> competition for light, water and nutrients. Following Hurricane Andrew in 1992, F. aurea trees regenerated from root suckers and standing trees.|$|E
5|$|New Thought and Christian Science {{differed}} in that Eddy saw her views {{as a unique}} and final revelation. Eddy's idea of malicious animal magnetism marked another distinction (that people can be <b>harmed</b> <b>by</b> the bad thoughts of others), introducing an element of fear that was absent from the New Thought literature. Most significantly, she dismissed the material world as an illusion, rather than as merely subordinate to Mind, leading her to reject the use of medicine, or materia medica, and making Christian Science the most controversial of the metaphysical groups. Reality for Eddy was purely spiritual.|$|E

5|$|The FEPP {{conducted}} a survey in 2001 which revealed that online monitoring software, including Net Nanny, SurfWatch, and Cybersitter, cast too broad a net and often blocked legitimate educational websites {{in their attempts to}} censor material from youths. In 2003, the organization assisted 33 academics in filing a friend-of-the-court brief challenging a law which restricted the sale of violent video games to minors. In coordination with the Brennan Center for Justice, the FEPP released a public policy report in 2006 on the inefficiency of Internet filtering; the report concluded that freedom of expression was <b>harmed</b> <b>by</b> such online censorship activity. In 2007, the FEPP became an independent organization.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the local}} Canton {{officials}} watched the Portuguese and their ships closely, once the provincial authorities arrived at Canton they greeted the Portuguese {{with a warm}} reception, providing them comfortable lodgings and had their trade goods brought ashore. The Chinese became suspicious once again of Andrade, this time for being a spy, when he sent a ship along the Fujian coast to look for further trade prospects, but he left a good impression when he gave the order that any locals who might be <b>harmed</b> <b>by</b> a Portuguese should seek him for redress. Besides exploring Fujian, Andrade sent one of his captains named Jorge de Mascarenhas to explore the Ryukyu Islands after he heard of their beauty while stationed in Malacca.|$|E
5|$|In late 2013, a {{plan was}} {{proposed}} for salvage logging approximately 30,000 acres (120km2) of the Rim Fire. The snag forest habitat of forest-killed trees {{is home to}} a wide variety of wildlife, some of which are management indicator species. Many scientists and conservation groups opposed the logging plan, contending that the removal of trees from this area would harm species such as black-backed woodpeckers and affect other cavity-nesting birds that follow in the wake of the woodpeckers. Other species of wildlife were also considered be at risk from salvage logging, such as frogs that inhabit forested streams and deer. Native plants and basic ecological succession of the forest are also reportedly <b>harmed</b> <b>by</b> salvage logging. However, some environmental groups endorsed the salvage logging plan.|$|E
