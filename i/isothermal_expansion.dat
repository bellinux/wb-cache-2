Since electrons gain relativistic energy from laser pulse {{in a period of}} several femtoseconds and driven away by the ponderomotive force of laser pulse, a huge charge-separation field pulse is generated. In general cases, the ion acceleration is determined by this charge-separation field. A novel general time-dependent solution for laser-plasma <b>isothermal</b> <b>expansions</b> into a vacuum with different types of the scale length of the density gradient which correspond to different charge separation forms is obtained.

2500|$|Other {{real-world}} issues {{reduce the}} efficiency of actual engines, because of limits of convective heat transfer, and viscous flow (friction). There are also practical mechanical considerations, for instance a simple kinematic linkage may be favoured over a more complex mechanism needed to replicate the idealized cycle, and limitations imposed by available materials such as non-ideal properties of the working gas, thermal conductivity, tensile strength, creep, rupture strength, and melting point. A question that often arises is whether the ideal cycle with <b>isothermal</b> <b>expansion</b> and compression {{is in fact the}} correct ideal cycle to apply to the Stirling engine. Professor C. J. Rallis has pointed out that {{it is very difficult to}} imagine any condition where the expansion and compression spaces may approach isothermal behavior and it is far more realistic to imagine these spaces as adiabatic. An ideal analysis where the expansion and compression spaces are taken to be adiabatic with isothermal heat exchangers and perfect regeneration was analyzed by Rallis and presented as a better ideal yardstick for Stirling machinery. He called this cycle the 'pseudo-Stirling cycle' or 'ideal adiabatic Stirling cycle'. An important consequence of this ideal cycle is that it does not predict Carnot efficiency. A further conclusion of this ideal cycle is that maximum efficiencies are found at lower compression ratios, a characteristic observed in real machines. In an independent work, T. Finkelstein also assumed adiabatic expansion and compression spaces in his analysis of Stirling machinery ...|$|E

Photobioreactors, closed vessels for microalgal cultivation, are known to have high energy consumption due to mixing and aeration. Sparging is commonly used for mixing and gas-liquid mass transfer in photobioreactors, but is energy intensive. The aim of this work was to reduce these energy requirements by optimising conventional sparging and considering surface aeration coupled with mechanical agitation as an alternative. An airlift photobioreactor was used as a base for comparison with two novel, surface aerated reactors: oscillatory baffled and wave photobioreactors.

50|$|This device {{accepts a}} heat input {{in a range}} 900-1300 K and {{produces}} direct current with predicted device efficiencies of 15-40%. In the AMTEC, sodium is driven around a closed thermodynamic cycle between a high-temperature heat reservoir and a cooler reservoir at the heat rejection temperature. The unique feature of the AMTEC cycle is that sodium ion conduction between a high-pressure or -activity region and a low-pressure or -activity region {{on either side of}} a highly ionically conducting refractory solid electrolyte is thermodynamically nearly equivalent to an <b>isothermal</b> <b>expansion</b> of sodium vapor between the same high and low pressures. Electrochemical oxidation of neutral sodium at the anode leads to sodium ions, which traverse the solid electrolyte, and electrons, which travel from the anode through an external circuit, where they perform electrical work, to the low-pressure cathode, where they recombine with the ions to produce low-pressure sodium gas. The sodium gas generated at the cathode then travels to a condenser at the heat-rejection temperature of perhaps 400-700 K, where liquid sodium reforms. The AMTEC thus is an electrochemical concentration cell, which converts the work generated by expansion of sodium vapor directly into electric power.|$|E
