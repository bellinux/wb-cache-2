50|$|The {{majority}} of historic actuators {{are made of}} ceramic piezoelectric materials. While these materials are able to withstand large forces, they commonly will only deform {{a fraction of a}} percent. In the late 1990s, it has been demonstrated that some EAPs can exhibit up to a 380% strain, which is much more than any ceramic actuator. One of the most common applications for EAPs is in the field of robotics in the development of artificial muscles; thus, an <b>electroactive</b> <b>polymer</b> {{is often referred to as}} an artificial muscle.|$|E
50|$|In 1999 Yoseph Bar-Cohen {{proposed}} the Armwrestling Match of EAP Robotic Arm Against Human Challenge.

The first challenge {{was held at the}} <b>Electroactive</b> <b>Polymer</b> Actuators and Devices Conference in 2005. Another major milestone of the field is that the first commercially developed device including EAPs as an artificial muscle was produced in 2002 by Eamex in Japan. This device was a fish that is able to swim on its own, moving its tail using an EAP muscle. But the progress in practical development is not satisfactory.|$|E
50|$|The armwrestling {{match of}} EAP robotic arm against human (AMERAH) is a {{challenge}} posed by Yoseph Bar-Cohen of the JPL in 1999.

The ultimate goal, however, is to create an arm using EAP as similar as possible to a human arm, which can beat any human in an arm wrestling competition. The competition aims to stimulate research in the field of <b>electroactive</b> <b>polymers,</b> as well as arouse interest both in the general public and among potential investors.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of new materials has greatly expanded the application of energy conversion technologies. Conducting <b>electroactive</b> <b>polymers,</b> such as polypyrrole and polythiophenes, containing specific groups represent {{a new class of}} electroactive semiconducting materials with great potential application in a number of areas, including hydrogen gas generation and photovoltaic devices. A range of novel conducting <b>electroactive</b> <b>polymers</b> have been synthesized and characterized in this work. A new electrolytic cell system for hydrogen gas generation and a new solar cell system for photovoltaic (energy conversion from sunlight to electricity) applications have been devised. Conducting <b>electroactive</b> <b>polymers,</b> polypyrrole and polythiophene, containing pendant group ferrocene or ferrocenophane have been electrochemically synthesized for hydrogen gas generation. Electrochemically controlled hydrogen production has been carried out with these new ferrocene or ferrocenophane containing polymer-modified platinum electrodes. Results show that these coatings catalyze hydrogen gas generation, which is associated with the presence of the ferrocene or ferrocenophane moiety in the conducting <b>electroactive</b> <b>polymers.</b> A significant and substantial anodic shift occurs in the potential for formation of hydrogen gas when using these polymer-modified platinum electrodes. In addition, the basicity of the ferrocene moiety and the porosity and the morphology of the conducting polymer have been shown to play significant roles in the rate of potentiostatic hydrogen gas generation. Photovoltaic devices have also been fabricated by using novel conducting <b>electroactive</b> <b>polymers</b> electrosynthesised from bis-linked terthiophene and porphyrin substituted bisterthiophene as light harvesters. The electropolymerisation conditions for these polymers have been investigated and optimised to produce the best photovoltaic device. In addition, the use of different liquid electrolytes, such as ionic liquids, has been examined in this work. As compared to the devices described by other research groups, significant improvement of photovoltaic responses for open circuit voltage (Voc) and short circuit current (Isc) has been observed using these new types of solar cells. The porphyrin group in the conducting polymers has been shown to {{play a significant role in}} the improved energy conversion (from sunlight to electricity) for photovoltaic devices...|$|R

5000|$|Initially, lithium {{cobalt oxide}} {{was used as}} the cathode and polyacetylene as the anode. Later in 1985, it was found that using lithium cobalt oxide as the cathode and {{graphite}} as the anode produced an excellent secondary battery with enhanced stability, employing the frontier electron theory of Kenichi Fukui [...] This enabled the development of portable devices, such as cell phones and laptops. However, before lithium ion batteries could be mass-produced, safety concerns needed to be addressed such as overheating and over potential. One key to ensuring safety was the separator between the cathode and anode. Yoshino developed a microporous polyethylene membrane separator with a “fuse” function. [...] In the case of abnormal heat generation within the battery cell, the separator provides a shutdown mechanism. The micropores close by melting and the ionic flow terminates. In 2004, a novel <b>electroactive</b> <b>polymer</b> separator with the function of overcharge protection was first proposed by Denton, et al. [...] This kind of separator reversibly switches between insulating and conducting states. Changes in charge potential drive the switch. More recently, separators primarily provide charge transport and electrode separation.|$|E
5000|$|Ionic polymer-metal {{composites}} (IPMCs) are synthetic composite nanomaterials {{that display}} artificial muscle behavior under an applied voltage or electric field. IPMCs {{are composed of}} an ionic polymer like Nafion or Flemion whose surfaces are chemically plated or physically coated with conductors such as platinum or gold. Under an applied voltage (1-5 V for typical 10mmx40mmx0.2mm samples), ion migration and redistribution due to the imposed voltage across a strip of IPMCs result in a bending deformation. If the plated electrodes are arranged in a non-symmetric configuration, the imposed voltage can induce all kinds of deformations such as twisting, rolling, torsioning, turning,twirling, whirling and non-symmetric bending deformation. Alternatively, if such deformations are physically applied to an IPMC strips they generate an output voltage signal (few millivolts for typical small samples) as sensors and energy harvesters. IPMCs are a type of <b>electroactive</b> <b>polymer.</b> They work very well in a liquid environment {{as well as in}} air. They have a force density of about 40 in a cantilever configuration, meaning that they can generate a tip force of almost 40 times their own weight in a cantilever mode. IPMCs in actuation,sensing and energy harvesting have a very broad bandwidth to kilo HZ and higher. IPMCs were first introduced in 1998 by Shahinpoor, Bar-Cohen, Xue, Simpson and Smith (see references below) but the original idea of ionic polymer actuators and sensors goes back to 1992-93 by Adolf, Shahinpoor, Segalman, Witkowski, Osada, Okuzaki, Hori, Doi, Matsumoto, Hirose, Oguro, Takenaka, Asaka and Kawami as depicted below: ...|$|E
