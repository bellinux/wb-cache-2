In people with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage the EVD is used to remove cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and blood byproducts that increase intracranial pressure and may increase the risk for cerebral vasospasm.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to use a straight or curved laryngoscope blade depends partly on the specific anatomical features of the airway, and partly on the personal experience and preference of the laryngoscopist. The Macintosh blade is {{the most widely used}} curved laryngoscope blade, while the Miller blade is the most popular style of straight blade. Both Miller and Macintosh laryngoscope blades are available in sizes 0 (infant) through 4 (large adult). There are many other styles of straight and curved blades, with accessories such as mirrors for enlarging the field of view and even ports for the administration of oxygen. These specialty blades are primarily designed for use by anesthetists and otolaryngologists, most commonly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> room.|$|E

5|$|The outer {{fringes of}} Hurricane Dean swept over Haiti {{bringing}} heavy squalls. On Gonâve Island, {{thousands of people}} lost power and some took shelter in schools and churches. The roof of the Hopital St. Michel in Jacmel, damaged before the storm, leaked significantly leading to water damage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> room. Two {{people were killed in}} Tiburon and Moron, towns in the south and southeast of the island, respectively. Seven other storm-related deaths were confirmed but few details were given. Another four were injured in a sailboat after disregarding warnings to stay in port. Several hundred homes were destroyed due to the resulting landslides. In the department of Sud-Est, Nippes, Centre, and Artibonite, 5,154people retreated to temporary shelters. Hurricanes typically pose significant hazards to potable water in Haiti, but Hurricane Dean produced only a modest 2.06inches (52mm) of rainfall. As such, the storm caused no major problems with water and sanitation, except in the town of Bainet, where the temperamental water system was compromised.|$|E

5|$|Matching, also {{referred}} to as “cost sharing”, is a requirement for the recipient to provide contributions or donations (usually non-federal) of a specified amount or percentage to supplement federal assistance received. In other words, when the recipient participates in a federal program (e.g. it receives federal assistance) and an operating budget is prepared, the federal government may require the recipient to provide contributions to cover a portion of that program’s operations. The matching requirement is based on the assertion that total program expenses are 100% and that, although the federal government provides assistance for most of those expenses, the recipient must still cover a portion of them. Such proportion is solely decided by the federal government, but usually the recipient decides how that contribution is provided and to which expenses, so long as the contribution is verifiable, generally does not originate from another federal program, and is considered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> budget. The expenses must be necessary and reasonable, allowed under cost principles (see B section above), and not used for another federal program. Matching may be in the form of contributing the recipient’s own funds or money to suffrage program allowable costs (e.g., paying program utility bills, paying part of program personnel payroll, etc.) or, in some cases, in the form of in-kind contributions, which are donations of non-monetary objects such as services, materials, property, etc.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: There are no data {{adressing}} {{the prevalence}} of restless legs syndrome in subjects who have knee prosthesis. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of subjects who underwent knee prosthesis surgery. METHOD: A total of 107 subjects (30 male, 77 female) were interviewed over the telephone regarding restless legs syndrome symptoms. If the patients exhibited symptoms of the syndrome, we conducted face-to-face interviews. Lastly, a therapeutic test with pramipexole was proposed for each subject. RESULTS: In our cohort, 7 males (23 %) and 30 females (39 %) had restless legs syndrome. Of these, 6 males and 23 females were submitted to face-to-face-interview. Of the males, 5 (83 %) had restless legs after <b>the</b> knee surgeryexclusively <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> leg- and reported no family restless legs history. One man had a prior case of bilateral restless legs syndrome, a positive family history and claimed exacerbation of symptoms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> leg. Among <b>the</b> females, 16 (69 %) had restless legs prior to surgery. A total of 10 female patients reported bilateral symptoms, with fewer symptoms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> leg, while 6 displayed a worse outcome <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> leg. <b>The</b> 7 females (31 %) without restless legs prior to surgery and without a family history experienced symptoms only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> leg. All subjects responded favorably to the pramipexole therapeutic test. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that secondary unilateral restless legs syndrome may ensue from knee prosthesis surgery and that the symptoms are generated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> peripheral nervous system.

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{undertook}} a cross-sectional study {{to evaluate the}} pennation angle and muscle thickness of the vastus lateralis muscle in patients undergoing unilateral anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft, and compared these values with the contralateral non-operated limb. METHODS: Twenty three consecutive athletic males who underwent ACL reconstruction using the central third of the patellar ligament were evaluated at 25. 9 ± 1. 5 months. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score was administered, and angles of pennation and muscle thickness were measured by ultrasonography. RESULTS: There {{was no significant difference}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pennation angle of <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> leg comparing to the contralateral leg (12. 5 °± 1. 81 ° <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> leg; 13. 25 °± 2. 40 ° after the test; p= 0. 117). Quadriceps thickness <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> leg was significantly decreased in all subjects compared to the contralateral leg (28. 4 ± 5. 3 mm <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> leg; 32. 7 ± 4. 85 mm <b>in</b> <b>the</b> contralateral leg; p= 0. 007). CONCLUSIONS: Two years after surgery, there is no difference in pennation angle of the vastus lateralis when compared to <b>the</b> contralateral side <b>in</b> patients undergoing unilateral ACL reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft. There is a significant difference in quadriceps muscle thickness, which was less <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> side on <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> side <b>in</b> all patients.

40|$|Acid {{phosphatase}} and esterase {{activities were}} studied in adrenal glands obtained from rats killed {{at regular intervals}} following surgical stress (cauda equina transection). Zymo-grams of acid phosphatase produced by starch gel electrophoresis revealed increased reactivity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> samples. With esterases, a slightly different pattern was ob-served <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> group, which exhibited a few additional bands particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cathode region. This was confirmed by densitometric analysis of the gel strips. Two of these additional bands were organophosphate-sensitive and the remaining few were acti-vated by p. chloromercuribenzoate. These latter bands appeared to arise from splitting of the preexisting organophosphate-resistant bands present in control zymograms. Bio-chemical assay of the two hydrolytic enzymes demonstrated a remarkable similarity in their responses to operative stress-probably implying a general lysosomal activation. Both enzymes exhibited a peak activity 8 hr after operation, followed by a gradual decline. Both organophosphate-sensitive and organophosphate-resistant esterases contributed toward <b>the</b> rise <b>in</b> total esterase activity.
