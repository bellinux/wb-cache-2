5|$|Diefenbaker <b>had</b> <b>approved</b> {{plans to}} join the United States in {{what became known as}} NORAD, an {{integrated}} air defence system, in mid-1957. Despite Liberal misgivings that Diefenbaker had committed Canada to the system before consulting either the Cabinet or Parliament, Pearson and his followers voted with the government to approve NORAD in June 1958.|$|E
5|$|In March 2009, it was {{announced}} that Jim Knight, Minister of State for Schools and Families, <b>had</b> <b>approved</b> plans that would mean the closure of both Ladymead Community School and the nearby St Augustine of Canterbury RC/CoE School both in the Priorswood area of Taunton. The schools closed in August 2010, and were replaced in September 2010 by The Taunton Academy.|$|E

5|$|Local soccer {{fans were}} {{concerned}} {{that the lack of}} a natural grass field would hinder Seattle's chances of receiving an MLS expansion franchise. They asserted that voters <b>had</b> <b>approved</b> the facility with the understanding that the new stadium was intended for soccer as well as football. In a compromise, First & Goal agreed to pay for grass to be installed for special events when needed.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on Blu-ray on July 26, 2011, with the same basic contents as the 25th-anniversary DVD. In a March 2011 interview with Ain't it Cool News, Landis also mentioned he <b>had</b> <b>approved</b> the Blu-ray's remastered transfer.|$|E
5|$|Although Dark Horse <b>had</b> <b>approved</b> 36 issues, {{there was}} still a chance the book could sell poorly and receive an early cancellation. The {{decision}} would be made after receiving the final sales number for the third issue, meaning Kindt was only guaranteed six issues. Not wanting to risk the series being cut off {{in the middle of a}} story, he designed the first six issues to stand alone if necessary. Kindt pencilled two endings for the last page of issue six so he would be prepared either way.|$|E
50|$|The Society of Cable and Telecommunications Engineers (SCTE) <b>has</b> <b>approved</b> SCTE 174 2010, the {{standards}} for RFoG. The standard <b>has</b> been <b>approved</b> by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).|$|R

5|$|At a Missouri state {{constitutional}} convention in 1875, delegates {{from the region}} agreed on a separation plan. A Board of Freeholders from St. Louis county and city reorganized boundaries and proposed a final plan of separation in mid-1876. The new city charter also tripled {{the size of the}} city to include the new rural parks (such as Forest Park) and the useful riverfront from the MissouriMississippi confluence to the mouth of the River Des Peres. After a fraudulent election initially showed a rejection of the plan, a recount in December 1876 showed voters <b>had</b> <b>approved</b> the separation.|$|E
5|$|Eaton {{took his}} revenge on Calhoun. In 1830, reports had emerged {{accurately}} stating that Calhoun, while Secretary of War, had favored censuring Jackson for his 1818 invasion of Florida. These infuriated Jackson. For reasons unclear, Calhoun asked Eaton to approach Jackson {{about the possibility}} of Calhoun publishing his correspondence with Jackson {{at the time of the}} Seminole War. Eaton did nothing. This caused Calhoun to believe that Jackson <b>had</b> <b>approved</b> the publication of the letters. Calhoun published them in the Telegraph. This gave the appearance of Calhoun trying to justify himself against a conspiracy to damage him, and further enraged the President.|$|E
5|$|Government {{publications}} on {{the dangers}} of sects increased between 1996 and 1998, and a significant number of them dealt with the Church of Scientology. The German courts <b>had</b> <b>approved</b> such publications in 1989, seeing them as part of the government's responsibility to keep the public informed, and finding that they did not interfere with religious freedom. In 1996, the German parliament launched an Enquete (Enquiry) Commission to investigate sects and similar groups, {{in large part because of}} public concerns about Scientology. Its final report, published in June 1998, concluded that Scientology, alone among new religious movements, required monitoring by Germany's domestic intelligence services.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, the Daily Telegraph {{reported}} that documents had surfaced indicating that Speer <b>had</b> <b>approved</b> {{the allocation of}} materials {{for the expansion of}} Auschwitz after two of his assistants toured the facility on a day when almost a thousand Jews were killed. The documents bore annotations in Speer's own handwriting. Speer biographer Gitta Sereny stated that, due to his workload, Speer would not have been personally aware of such activities.|$|E
5|$|In April 2011, May {{confirmed}} that pre-production work was continuing. He said the band <b>had</b> <b>approved</b> {{a team to}} start filming later in 2011, and Baron Cohen's eagerness had been the key to progress. However, in July 2013, Baron Cohen {{dropped out of the}} role due to creative differences with the members of Queen. May said they had parted on good terms and said that the band had felt Cohen's presence would have been distracting.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, Meir Abergil {{returned}} to Israel after a California court <b>had</b> <b>approved</b> a plea agreement setting him free. In May 2012, Itzhak Abergil was sentenced by a Los Angeles {{federal court to}} 10 years in prison with credit for time served, after pleading guilty to {{being part of a}} racketeering enterprise that distributed Ecstasy and whose members killed a man for stealing a large drug shipment. He is to serve the remaining eight and a half years time in Israel.|$|E

5|$|In June 2008, three senior health {{officials}} {{announced that they}} would be leaving the province's employment at the expiration of their contracts in August. Liepert blamed their departures on better offers from other employers, although New Democrat leader Brian Mason speculated that the government's health restructuring may have been to blame. Detractors pointed out that the optics of allowing the employees to depart for more money elsewhere soon after the government <b>had</b> <b>approved</b> a substantial pay hike for cabinet ministers were not good.|$|E
5|$|Mary {{had always}} {{rejected}} the break with Rome instituted {{by her father}} {{and the establishment of}} Protestantism by her brother's regents. Philip persuaded Parliament to repeal Henry's religious laws, thus returning the English church to Roman jurisdiction. Reaching an agreement took many months and Mary and Pope Julius III had to make a major concession: the monastery lands confiscated under Henry were not returned to the church but remained in the hands of their influential new owners. By the end of 1554, the pope <b>had</b> <b>approved</b> the deal, and the Heresy Acts were revived.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand was {{the third}} country to create the VC {{as part of its}} own honours system. On 21 September 1999, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley {{announced}} that the Queen <b>had</b> <b>approved</b> the formal institution of a new range of Royal awards to recognise acts of gallantry and bravery performed by New Zealanders. The awards were designed to be the final major element {{in the development of a}} distinct New Zealand Royal honours system.|$|E

5|$|Sigismund {{maintained}} close {{relations with}} Erik XIV's brother, John, Duke of Finland (later John III), and in October 1562 John married Sigismund's sister, Catherine, thereby preventing her marrying Ivan IV. While Erik XIV <b>had</b> <b>approved</b> the marriage, {{he was upset}} when John lent Sigismund 120,000 dalers and received seven Livonian castles as security. This incident led to John's capture and imprisonment in August 1563 on Erik XIV's behalf, whereupon Sigismund allied with Denmark and Lübeck against Erik XIV in October the same year.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the special}} effects could not be {{designed}} in India, so Makuta VFX engaged animation consultants in Armenia, China, Iran, Israel, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The company's 30-member team underwent a training programme on acting theory and insect formats. Eega is the first Indian film to use computer-generated imagery for nearly 90 minutes of its length; the film had 2,234 live-action animation shots. By mid-June 2012 Rajamouli <b>had</b> <b>approved</b> 1,970 shots; the final version was shown to the film unit after the approval of 226 pending shots. The visual effects cost an estimated 70 million.|$|E
5|$|These {{ideas were}} {{somewhat}} similar to {{elements of the}} 1946 French film version of Beauty and the Beast, which introduced the character of Avenant, an oafish suitor somewhat similar to Gaston, as well as inanimate objects coming {{to life in the}} Beast's castle. The animated objects were, however, given distinct personalities in the Disney version. By early 1990, Katzenberg <b>had</b> <b>approved</b> the revised script, and storyboarding began again. The production flew story artists back and forth between California and New York for storyboard approvals from Ashman, though the team was not told the reason why.|$|E
