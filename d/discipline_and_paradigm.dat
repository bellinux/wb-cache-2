This article provides comparative insights and makes information about the Hebrew revival accessible to Australian linguists and Aboriginal revival activists.

40|$|The {{research}} {{interest is}} based on a need for knowledge development related to the substantial gap between movement as a scientific concept and the practice concept of movement in physiotherapy (PT). The aim is to deepen the understanding of movement as a basic concept in PT and thereby expand the understanding of the PT <b>discipline</b> <b>and</b> <b>paradigm.</b> The thesis also aims to expand the understanding of movement as a universal scientific concept. The research questions are: 1) What is the meaning of movement as a basic concept in PT when relating to the ontological meaning, substance, form and essence? 2) What outlines for a scientific theory, with the foundation in the ontological meaning and essence of movement, can be brought forward and used as a basis for development of an internally shaped PT discipline? 3) What is the core and essence of movement as a universal concept? The dissertation is inspired by the tradition of caring, and based on a human science approach. The dissertation is categorized as basic research. The overall approach is hermeneutic and the methodology {{is based on}} Eriksson’s (2010 a; 2012) model for concept determination consisting of ontological and contextual determination. The understanding of movement is deepened and the concept is explored from different perspectives: the semantic, the everyday life, the professional, the history of ideas and PT discipline in a hermeneutic spiral where the contextual characteristics are reflected on the ontological characteristics, and vice versa. The hermeneutic interpretation as a continuous spiral between part and the whole – relating the empirical and theory are central. The results of the dissertation consist of three new horizons of understanding: 1) movement as a basic and core concept in PT, 2) a contextual model of movement in PT and 3) a universal ideal model for natural movement. Movement as value, meaning and emotion, with natural movement as an ethos constitute a basic and core concept for PT as a human science. Natural movement is anchored in the historical core and traditional values of PT. The ontological meaning of movement expands the understanding of the active means and forms of movement in physiotherapy in relation to health, health processes and suffering. Natural movement as an ethos may form a research object within the PT discipline with its basis in the health cure and the ontological meaning of the movement concept. The ideal model constitutes a first outline of natural movement as a basic scientific concept. The natural movement of humans can increase the understanding of movement and the bodily dimension in relation to health and suffering. The models and theses, which are introduced as results of the study, are preliminary and provide a basis for further research. Movement as a basic and core concept enable a systematic further development of the PT discipline as a human science and movement as a universal scientific concept...|$|E

40|$|Studying the {{politics}} of economic activity certainly necessitates drawing upon relevant literatures from at leas t economics, political science, sociology and history. However, scholars of the EU's political economy all too often mix these multi-­disciplinary sources of data and their interpretation into cocktails of disconnected descriptions and incoherent theory. This paper will argue instead that genuinely inter-­disciplinary research on {{the politics}} of Europe's economy can only be achieved by disciplining it with consistent theorizing, research design and interpretation of empirical findings. It first proposes an approach that seeks to achieve this aim by combining both constructivist and institutionalist epistemology and ontology with methodological lessons from compatible branches of sociology. This approach is then illustrated using finding from a research program on the EU's government of industries, and that of pharmaceuticals in particular. Involving economists and political scientists, this research has consistently shown this government's drivers to be conflict and cooperation over values (i. e. politics). Overall, the argument developed throughout this paper concurs that theories of European integration, its causes and its effects should mobilize syntheses of literatures inspired by different social science <b>disciplines</b> <b>and</b> <b>paradigms.</b> However, for the theory ultimately proposed to be heuristic and socially relevant, it cannot contain compromises over key concepts and their articulation within coherent analytical frameworks...|$|R

40|$|The present article elaborates on the {{specific}} approach to and practice of research for sustainable development as conceptualised and implemented by the Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) North- South. At the core is the overarching understanding of sustainable development as a normative concept demanding goal-oriented collaboration among disciplines as well as co-production of knowledge at the interface of scientific communities and society. Transdisciplinarity, research partnerships, and a recursive research approach are necessary pillars in the quest to bridge <b>disciplines</b> <b>and</b> <b>paradigms,</b> as well as science and society in sustainability-oriented research. We argue that research for sustainable development faces major conceptual challenges related to system definition, linking to disciplinary discourses and progress, and bridging contextuality and generalisation, alongside operational challenges of conflicting reference systems, conflicting basic objectives, and complex science–society interfaces. With reference to the NCCR North-South we show how these challenges can successfully be dealt with. Finally, we argue that sustainability-oriented development research, transdisciplinarity, and research partnerships can be strengthened in science and knowledge societies by systematically addressing the basic challenges at the levels of scientific concepts and methodologies, underlying ontologies, and scientific and social interactions and collaborations, {{as well as at}} the level of management and communication. This will require major efforts within broadly based research networks backed by political commitment and support – as is the case in the NCCR North-South...|$|R

[...] The term [...] "political psychology" [...] was first introduced by the ethnologist Adolph Bastian in his book Man in History (1860). The philosopher Hippolyte Taine (1828-1893), a founder of the Ecole Libre de Sciences Politiques, applied Bastian's theories in his works The Origins of Contemporary France (1875-1893), to ideas on the founding and development of the Third Republic. The head of Ecole Libre de Sciences Politiques, Emile Boutmy (1835-1906), was a famous explorer of social, political and geographical concepts of national interactions. He contributed various works on political psychology such as English People; A study of their Political Psychology (1901) and The American People; Elements of Their Political Psychology (1902). The contributor of crowd theory Gustave Le Bon (1841-1931) suggested that crowd activity subdued will and polluted rational thought which resulted in uncontrollable impulses and emotions. He suggested in his works Psychology of Socialism (1896) and Political Psychology and Social Defense (1910) that in the uncontrollable state of a crowd people were more vulnerable to submission and leadership, and suggested that embracing nationalism would remedy this.|$|R

The complexities of brand management warrant study from a diverse range of theoretical <b>disciplines</b> <b>and</b> <b>paradigms.</b> This study seeks to explore branding {{from the perspective of}} the SME retailer. A multiple case study approach is utilised, which investigates retail branding in the context of 18 small to medium retailer enterprises. The findings of this study showcase the importance of both the SME specific dynamic~ upon retail branding and, conversely, the nature of retail branding upon SME brand management. As such, a number of contributions are made to the brand management, retail branding and SME branding discourses. These findings include the very nature of retail branding, as a disparate marketing concept, and its implications of this upon SME brand management practice. The inherent constraints of the SME context introduce a number of idiosyncracies to retail branding. Conversely, the structure of the SME, specifically the centricity of the owner manager, elicit a number offacilitators to retail brand management. In practice, this study finds that retail branding in SMEs encompasses management of the retail process across a number of store based components. Moreover, SME owner managers focus on service and product mix features of their retail businesses and attempt to embed meanings of localisation, familyness and heritage into their brand. Finally, the entrepreneurial nature of brand performance is exposed in terms of how SMEs appraise their brand equity based upon intuitive, colloquial customer brand centricity.

Ultimately, the argument put forward in the book is that ecstatic experience takes place in both religious and secular settings and is best understood by both theistic and non-theistic approaches, working together. The ecstatic experience common to both contexts is theorised as ‘proto-religious phenomena’ – the kernel from which religion may develop...|$|R
