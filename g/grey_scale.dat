6000|$|It {{was only}} when I got thus close {{to it that the}} strangeness of this object was at all evident to me. At the first glance it was really no more {{exciting}} than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road. Not so much so, indeed. It looked like a rusty gas float. It required a certain amount of scientific education to perceive that the <b>grey</b> <b>scale</b> of the Thing was no common oxide, that the yellowish-white metal that gleamed in the crack between the lid and the cylinder had an unfamiliar hue. [...] "Extra-terrestrial" [...] had no meaning for most of the onlookers.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 5.9-9.3 mm. The forewings are brownish grey intermixed with pale brownish <b>grey</b> <b>scales,</b> brownish <b>grey</b> <b>scales</b> tipped with pale brownish <b>grey</b> and brown <b>scales.</b> The hindwings are grey.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 14-17 mm {{for males}} and 15-18 mm for females. The head, thorax, forewing and abdomen are finely speckled with white and <b>grey</b> <b>scales</b> or white-tipped <b>grey</b> <b>scales,</b> with a wide colour range from pale (predominantly white <b>scales)</b> to dark <b>grey.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 7-9 mm. The forewings {{are white}} with <b>grey</b> <b>scales.</b>|$|R
60|$|Take cakes of lake, of gamboge, of sepia, of blue-black, of cobalt, and vermilion; {{and prepare}} gradated columns (exactly {{as you have}} done with the Prussian blue) {{of the lake and}} blue-black.[206] Cut a narrow slip all the way down, of each gradated colour, and set the three slips side by side; fasten them down, and rule lines at equal {{distances}} across all the three, so as to divide them into fifty degrees, and number the degrees of each, from light to dark, 1, 2, 3, &c. If you have gradated them rightly, the darkest part either of the red or blue will be nearly equal in power to the darkest part of the blue-black, and any degree of the black slip will also, accurately enough for our purpose, balance in weight the degree similarly numbered in the red or the blue slip. Then, when you are drawing from objects of a crimson or blue colour, if you can match their colour by any compartment of the crimson or blue in your scales, the grey in the compartment of the <b>grey</b> <b>scale</b> marked with the same number is the grey which must represent that crimson or blue in your light and shade drawing.|$|E

50|$|In short, the {{millions}} of switches housed on an active matrix display's back-plane, be they TFTs or TFDs, must each be able to accurately and repeatably control the voltage applied to their respective pixel {{in order to control}} its <b>grey</b> <b>scale.</b> While thin film diodes are cheaper to manufacture than TFTs it can difficult to achieve a wide color gamut and <b>grey</b> <b>scale</b> using single TFDs. These limitation can be overcome however by using a dual-select diode circuit which incorporates two MIM TFDs per pixel circuit.|$|E

50|$|The most {{well known}} scales {{measuring}} the lightfastness are the Blue Wool Scale, <b>Grey</b> <b>scale</b> and the scale defined by ASTM (American Standard Test Measure). On the Blue Wool Scale the lightfastness is rated between 1-8. 1 being very poor and 8 being excellent lightfastness. In <b>grey</b> <b>scale</b> the lightfastness is rated between 1-5. 1 being very poor and 5 being excellent lightfastness. On ASTM scale the lightfastness is rated between I-V. I is excellent lightfastness and it corresponds to ratings 7-8 on Blue Wool Scale. V is very poor lightfastness and it corresponds to Blue Wool scale rating 1.|$|E

50|$|Brilliance {{represents}} average <b>grey</b> <b>scale</b> {{value of}} pixels comprising the top {{view of a}} diamond. This particular characteristic is generally accepted in most systems interested in light behavior of a diamond. Sparkle is measured as variation of <b>grey</b> <b>scale</b> values among pixels within the perimeter of a diamond. ImaGem uses sparkle to identify the dynamic behavior (scintillation) when a diamond or light is moved. Intensity (contrast) is a new concept introduced by ImaGem to capture the pattern of dark and bright areas in a diamond. This particular characteristic is patented and represents an attribute of a diamond {{that takes into account}} figure ground segregation essential to human perception. These three measures of light behavior in a diamond, in summary, are derived from direct measurement, are objective, repeatable, and take into account human perception of visual objects.|$|E

The hindwings are uniform.|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} this {{lightness}} factor would be if there were different colors on a grey background that all are of the same lightness. Obviously the colors look different because they are different colors not just grey, but if the image were converted all to <b>grey</b> <b>scale,</b> all of the colors would match the grey background because they {{all have the same}} lightness.|$|E

5000|$|The MSER {{algorithm}} {{can be used}} {{to detect}} regions based on color as opposed to intensity. This is done by Chavez by creating an intensity function for red, green, and blue in the HSV color space. The MSER algorithm is then run five times; over the three color pseduo-intensities and then over the <b>grey</b> <b>scale</b> intensities using the standard MSER+ and MSER- functions.|$|E
