40|$|In {{previous}} reports, annular sampling {{has been}} introduced {{as a means for}} detecting symmetrically <b>enclosing</b> <b>edge</b> configurations. Starting with a single grey-scale image, before employing annular operators, it is necessary to first extract edges from the image. In this report, we examine why it is necessary to extract edge at multiple scales when employing annular operators. The scale of edge detection is defined in terms of the spatial extent over which an edge has support in an image. Curvature constraints imposed by the annular sampling scheme are then used to define an edge detection scheme in which the spatial extent of an edge is set in proportion to the annular scale. Results are demonstrated for several images acquired in natural settings...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} {{one in a series}} which deals with the topic of using annular {{symmetry}} operators to extract object information from images. The two reports which precede this one discuss symmetric enclosure [11] and sampling with annular operators [10]. In this report, we discuss some of the computational issues surrounding the extraction and interpretation of symmetry data using annular operators. Annular operators are applied to edge data that has been extracted from a gray-scale image. We make the distinction between two types of <b>enclosing</b> <b>edge</b> configurations - termed limbs and blobs. It is shown theoretically that each type has a unique signature that can be identified by examining extracted symmetry points within the three-dimensional S-space defined by the two spatial coordinates and one scale coordinate. Based on this, we have developed a computational method for detecting blob and limb parts in images. An important factor which influences our approach is the need to extract specif [...] ...|$|E

40|$|By {{restricting the}} input to a problem, it often becomes {{possible}} to design more accurate or more efficient algorithms {{to solve that}} problem. In this thesis we restrict our attention to planar graphs and achieve both these goals. Planar graphs exhibit many structural and combinatorial properties that enable the design of good algorithms. These properties include: corresponding to every planar graph there is a dual planar graph; the dual of the complement of the edges of a spanning tree form a spanning tree of the dual graph; a set of edges is a cycle {{if and only if}} the dual edges form a cut; cycles can be said to <b>enclose</b> <b>edges,</b> faces and vertices in the planar embedding; paths can be compared as to their relative embedding. We capitalize on these properties to design (a) faster algorithms for polynomial-time-solvable network flow problems and (b) algorithms with better approximation guarantees for NP-hard connectivity problems. We give a conceptually simple O(n log n) -time algorithm for finding the maximum st-flow in a directed planar graph, proving a theorem that was incorrectly claimed over a decade ago. We also show how to compute the minimum cut between all pairs of vertices on a common face of a planar graph in linear time. We give the first polynomial-time approximation schemes for the Steiner-tree and 2 -edge-connected subgraph problems. Both schemes are NP-hard in planar graphs and admit no PTAS in general graphs. Our schemes run in O(n log n) time...|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} the first {{observation}} of a novel type of superconducting proximity network using a superconductor-normal metal bilayer. Little-Parks oscillation measurements show that the superconducting current flows through a path <b>enclosed</b> by the <b>edge</b> {{rather than by the}} center of the Pb/Au wire in the network. Furthermore, several peaks were observed in a power spectrum analysis. We observed that the sequence of these peaks and that of the monolayer network were connected by the power function, which is a factor of the line width, S_B_n = α^n- 2 S_A_n. This suggests that even in a proximity network vortices are arranged in a way identical to a monolayer network. Comment: 13 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|A {{single copy}} of apoB {{is the sole}} protein {{component}} of human LDL. ApoB is crucial for LDL particle stabilization and is the ligand for LDL receptor, through which cholesterol is delivered to cells. Dysregulation of the pathways of LDL metabolism is well documented in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. However, {{an understanding of the}} structure of LDL and apoB underlying these biological processes remains limited. In this study, we derived a 22 Å-resolution three-dimensional (3 D) density map of LDL using cryo-electron microscopy and image reconstruction, which showed a backbone of high-density regions that encircle the LDL particle. Additional high-density belts complemented this backbone high density to <b>enclose</b> the <b>edge</b> of the LDL particle. Image reconstructions of monoclonal antibody-labeled LDL located six epitopes in five putative domains of apoB in 3 D. Epitopes in the LDL receptor binding domain were located {{on one side of the}} LDL particle, and epitopes in the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of apoB were in close proximity at the front side of the particle.

Furthermore, the output mesh is graded. Our work is the first that provides quality guarantees for Delaunay meshes in the presence of small input angles...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} simple and {{practical}} approach for segmenting un-occluded items in a scene by actively casting shadows. By ’items’, we refer to objects (or part of objects) <b>enclosed</b> by depth <b>edges.</b> Our approach utilizes the fact that under varying illumination, un-occluded items will cast shadows on occluded items or background, but will not be shadowed themselves. We employ an active illumination approach by taking multiple images under different illumination directions, with illumination {{source close to the}} camera. Our approach ignores the texture edges in the scene and uses only the shadow and silhouette information to determine the occlusions. We show that such a segmentation does not require the estimation of a depth map or 3 D information, which can be cumbersome, expensive and often fails {{due to the lack of}} texture and presence of specular objects in the scene. Our approach can handle complex scenes with self-shadows and specularities. Results on several real scenes along with the analysis of failure cases are presented. ...|$|R
40|$|The topological {{insulators}} have {{a gap in}} {{the bulk}} but extended states at the edge that can carry current. We study a geometry in which such edge states will manifest themselves through periodic oscillations in the magnetoconductance of a singly connected sample coupled to leads through narrow point contacts. The oscillations occur due to quantum interference of helical edge states of electrons traveling along the circumference of the sample, and have a period of B_ 0 =h/eA_{eff}, where A_{eff} is the effective area <b>enclosed</b> by the <b>edge</b> states of the sample. Our calculation indicates the possibility of a large change in the magnetoresistance at small B, termed giant edge magnetoresistance, which can have potential for application. The zero field conductance also exhibits oscillations {{as a function of the}} Fermi energy due to interference between edge states. The amplitude of the oscillations is governed by, and therefore can be used to investigate, the transverse width of the edge channels. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|We study {{theoretically}} how electrons, coherently injected at {{one point}} on the boundary of a two-dimensional electron system, are focused by a perpendicular magnetic field $B$ onto another point on the boundary. Using the non-equilibrium Green's function approach, we calculate the generalized 4 -point Hall resistance $R_{xy}$ {{as a function of}} B. In weak fields, $R_{xy}$ shows the characteristic equidistant peaks observed in the experiment and explained by classical cyclotron motion along the boundary. In strong fields, $R_{xy}$ shows a single extended plateau reflecting the quantum Hall effect. In intermediate fields, we find superimposed upon the lower Hall plateaus anomalous oscillations, which are neither periodic in 1 /B (quantum Hall effect) nor in $B$ (classical cyclotron motion). The oscillations are explained by the interference between the occupied edge channels, which causes beatings in $R_{xy}$. In the case of two occupied edge channels, these beatings constitute a new commensurability between the magnetic flux <b>enclosed</b> within the <b>edge</b> channels and the flux quantum. Introducing decoherence and a partially specular boundary shows that this new effect is quite robust. Comment: 7 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
50|$|Horder or Horderus, {{also known}} as the Djursland Master, was a Danish stonemason who was active around the end of the 12th century. The name Horderus was found on a {{tombstone}} bearing twisted rope in Løvenholm in Norddjurs Municipality and was ascribed, perhaps wrongly, to the artist who decorated churches in the Djursland area of eastern Jutland and on the island of Funen. He is remembered above all for his finely executed baptismal fonts and portals with their shallow reliefs, frequently framed with twisted rope. Given their shallow dimensions, the reliefs may originally have been painted. They depict either Biblical scenes or animals. Horder's main works are the church portals of Rimsø, Vejlby and Ørsted and the font in Holbæk Church. The fonts are typically decorated with ropes along all the edges and foliage in one or two bands on the sides. Their bases also have ropes along the <b>edges</b> <b>enclosing</b> foliage or animal figures. A considerable number of baptismal fonts were once attributed to Horder but it is now thought that his rope-framed designs were copied by one or more other workshops.|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- Analysing {{neural network}} edge {{detection}} (NNED) is being {{presented in a}} new method {{in order to gain}} a close insight into their internal functionality. A training sets consisting of a limited number of prototype edge patterns is proposed in order to analyze the problem of edge detection. The generated set of vectors simply corresponds to standard situations that are clearly understood as edges or non-edges and also permit a controlled distribution of the <b>edges</b> <b>enclosed.</b> The behavior of neural network edge detector’s hidden units, as templates, were analyzed into three gradient component: low pass, gradient, and second-order gradients. Although the above only gives some analysis results for the units in the hidden units, it should be clear that a characterization of the neural network as a whole could also be derived from these results. Visual comparisons are conducted here, by image convolution of the weights templates with a real test image to demonstrate the feature extracted by each hidden node of NNED. Different image features extracted by image convolution could provide a simple verification of the investigated gradient analysis method...|$|R
