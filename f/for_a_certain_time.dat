5|$|The player {{controls}} Neku {{by performing}} touchscreen actions {{based on the}} currently equipped pins. These actions may include slashing across an enemy, tapping the screen rapidly to fire bullets, holding down on an enemy to inflict damage or shouting into the microphone to cause a full screen attack. Other pins need to be touched to activate them, such as for health restoration. Each pin has {{a limited number of}} uses before it must recharge <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>time.</b> Other pins may only be used a fixed number of times during a series of battles, and do not recharge until the battle sequence is over. Neku can only be equipped with a maximum of two pins at the game's start; this can eventually be upgraded to a maximum of six.|$|E
25|$|Often {{in social}} life, animals {{fight for the}} right to reproduce, as well as social supremacy. A common example of {{fighting}} for social and sexual supremacy is the so-called pecking order among poultry. Every time a group of poultry cohabitate <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>time</b> length, they establish a pecking order. In these groups, one chicken dominates the others and can peck without being pecked. A second chicken can peck all the others except the first, and so on. Higher level chickens are easily distinguished by their well-cured aspect, as opposed to lower level chickens. While the pecking order is establishing, frequent and violent fights can happen, but once established, it is broken only when other individuals enter the group, in which case the pecking order re-establishes from scratch.|$|E
25|$|All DT3 {{units are}} {{equipped}} with passenger intercom panels near every door {{in addition to the}} standard emergency brakes and emergency door release handles. Controllers can access CCTV cameras in every unit from the control centre through a Wireless LAN link installed in all tunnels that are used by DT3 trains. Flame-retardant materials are used wherever possible. Temperature sensors and smoke detectors are spread throughout every unit in the passenger space and in every underfloor machinery compartment to detect possible fires as early as possible. Circuit integrity retaining electrical cables (cables that can keep their insulation <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>time</b> in the presence of fire) are used to allow a unit to proceed to the next station in case of a fire. German regulations mandate that all subway trains must not stop inside a tunnel after the emergency brake has been pulled or if any other hazard like a fire is detected, but instead should proceed to the next station if possible to ease rescue operations. Since the longest travel time between two stations on the Nuremberg U-Bahn is about 3 Minutes (between Ziegelstein and Flughafen) and most stations are less than 60 seconds apart, this is deemed a superior option to stopping inside a tunnel, where evacuation, rescue and firefighting attempts would be much more difficult than on a station platform.|$|E

500|$|Imagism {{has been}} {{described}} as the most influential movement in English poetry since the activity of the Pre-Raphaelites. As a poetic style it gave Modernism its start in the early 20th century, and is considered to be the first organized Modernist literary movement in the English language. [...] Imagism is sometimes viewed as 'a succession of creative moments' rather than any continuous or sustained period of development. René Taupin remarked that 'It is more accurate to consider Imagism not as a doctrine, nor even as a poetic school, but as the association of a few poets who were <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>time</b> in agreement on a small number of important principles'.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of the game, Alisia and her monsters can improve their {{abilities}} by collecting power-ups. These enhancement items are placed throughout the first seven stages, mostly in hidden locations. The various power-ups can heal Alisia and her monsters, increase their maximum life bars, improve their attacks, or grant invulnerability <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>time.</b> Life bars are lost by taking damage from enemy attacks and traps. When Alisia's pets lose all their life bars, they are removed from play and cannot be brought back until a [...] "Revive" [...] power-up is collected. If Alisia loses all her life bars, she can restart the level by expending a continue. The game ends if all the continues have been used. Alisia Dragoon has no features for saving the player's progress. After the game is completed, a screen is shown, charting the overall performance of the player {{based on the number of}} kills, the power level of Alisia's attack, and the frequency the pet monsters are used.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the absence}} of stimulated {{emission}} (e.g., lasing) conditions, electrons and holes may coexist in proximity to one another, without recombining, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>time,</b> termed the [...] "upper-state lifetime" [...] or [...] "recombination time" [...] (about a nanosecond for typical diode laser materials), before they recombine. A nearby photon with energy equal to the recombination energy can cause recombination by stimulated emission. This generates another photon of the same frequency, polarization, and phase, travelling {{in the same direction}} as the first photon. This means that stimulated emission will cause gain in an optical wave (of the correct wavelength) in the injection region, and the gain increases as the number of electrons and holes injected across the junction increases. The spontaneous and stimulated emission processes are vastly more efficient in direct bandgap semiconductors than in indirect bandgap semiconductors; therefore silicon is not a common material for laser diodes.|$|E

2500|$|During its history, {{the statue}} faced many hazards. It {{miraculously}} survived undamaged the bombardment of Brussels of 1695 by the French army, but the pipes having been affected, {{it could not}} deliver its water <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>time.</b> A pamphlet published the same year recounts this episode. This text is the oldest attesting that Manneken Pis had become [...] "an object of glory appreciated by all and renowned throughout the world". It is also {{the first time that}} it served as a symbol for the people of Brussels. It is also traditionally said that after the bombardment, it was triumphantly placed again on its pedestal. On that occasion, the following passage from the Bible was inscribed above its head : In petra exaltavit me, et nunc exaltavi caput meum super inimicos meos ("The Lord placed me on a stone base, and now I raise my head above my enemies"). As shown by an engraving by Jacques Harrewijn, dating from 1697, the fountain was no longer located on the street, but in a recess {{at the corner of the}} Rue du Chêne and de l'Étuve.|$|E
2500|$|Sonnets 153 and 154 use Greek mythology {{to portray}} the roles that the {{individuals}} have within the love triangle. Both sonnets involve Cupid, the god of love, and Diana, the virgin goddess of hunt. In sonnet 153, Cupid falls asleep, a virgin nymph takes the torch from cupid and tries to extinguish the fire but [...] "she only succeeds in turning the water into a boiling fountain". In Sonnet 154, Cupid falls asleep and the torch is taken by the most beautiful nymph who tries {{to put it out}} in a nearby well but does not succeed. Drawing from both effects of these actions performed by both nymphs, both sonnets arrive at same conclusion: [...] "Water cannot quench love". In connecting the sonnets to the love triangle, {{there is a sense of}} determination in satisfying ones urges for love for the torch is the phallic symbol according to Levin. No matter how hard these three troubled lovers try to satisfy their urges,their need for love grows stronger. Cupid is the god of love and is in the midst of love just as the young man is in the midst of the love triangle between the poet and the Dark Lady. In sonnet 153, a virgin nymph takes the torch which corresponds to the young man getting engaged to the virgin which [...] "briefly interrupts the cycle of passion and betrayals in the love triangle that the sonnet cycle has traced". The torch still turns the fountain into a boiling fountain and for Levin this portrays the young man's drive to [...] "heat the desire of others". The love triangle will be severed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>time</b> and will form again due to the young man's sexual tendencies. In sonnet 154, the most beautiful nymph takes the torch and tries to extinguish the torch in the well and also fails. In sonnet 154,The beautiful nymph is the virgin that will now marry the young man for now [...] "seeing that she can have for herself [...] "that fire" [...] (154.5) that previously she had to share with [...] "many Legions of true hearts" [...] (154.6), seizes [...] "advantage" [...] (153.2) by picking up the young man's brand and quenching it in [...] "the could vallie-fountain of that ground"—that is, in her virgin vagina”. There is still a small possibility that the young man will commit adultery but Levin states that this is also related to Hymen, the God of love. The act of setting the torch in the well indicates that the young man will settle with virgins propositions that is [...] "suggested by her vow, which was to [...] "keep" [...] not maidenhood but [...] "chast life" [...] (154.3)".|$|E

30|$|Using {{analytical}} methods and different yield criteria {{such as the}} maximum principal stress criterion, Tresca criterion, and von Mises criterion, many scholars derived the analytical solutions for the limit loads of plates. Some systematic and comprehensive summaries {{can be found in}} the monographs of Hodge [1], Save and Massonnet [2], Zyczkowski [3], Xu and Liu [4], Lubliner [5], Yu et al. [6], etc. Using numerical methods, some early works for the limit loads of plates can be mentioned such as those by Hodge and Belytschko [7] and Nguyen [8]. However, due to the lack of efficient optimization algorithms and the limit of the computing power, the numerical limit analysis of plates seems to be ignored <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>times.</b>|$|R
