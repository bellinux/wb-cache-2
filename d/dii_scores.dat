40|$|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The dietary {{inflammatory}} index (DII) {{measured at}} one time point is associated with risk of several chronic diseases, but disease risk may change with longitudinal changes in <b>DII</b> <b>scores.</b> Data are lacking regarding changes in <b>DII</b> <b>scores</b> over time; therefore, we assessed changes in the DII in the Women 2 ̆ 7 s Health Initiative (WHI). SUBJECTS/METHODS: <b>DII</b> <b>scores</b> were calculated using data from repeated food frequency questionnaires in the WHI Observational Study (OS; n= 76 671) at baseline and year 3, and the WHI Dietary Modification trial (DM; n= 48482) at three time points. Lower <b>DII</b> <b>scores</b> represent more anti-inflammatory diets. We used generalized estimating equations to compare mean changes in DII over time, adjusting for multiple comparisons, and multivariable-adjusted linear regression analyses to determine predictors of DII change. RESULTS: In the OS, mean DII decreased modestly from - 1. 14 at baseline to - 1. 50 at year 3. In the DM, DII was - 1. 32 in year 1, - 1. 60 in year 3 and - 1. 48 in year 6 in the intervention arm and was - 0. 65 in year 1, - 0. 94 in year 3 and - 0. 96 in year 6 in the control arm.

40|$|Previous {{studies suggest}} that bone loss and {{fracture}} risk are associated with higher inflammatory milieu, potentially modifiable by diet. The primary objective of this analysis was to evaluate the association of the dietary inflammatory index (DII), {{a measure of the}} inflammatory potential of diet, with risk of hip, lower-arm, and total fracture using longitudinal data from the Women 2 ̆ 7 s Health Initiative Observational Study and Clinical Trials. Secondarily, we evaluated changes in bone mineral density (BMD) and <b>DII</b> <b>scores.</b> <b>DII</b> <b>scores</b> were calculated from baseline food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) completed by 160, 191 participants (mean age 63 years) without history of hip fracture at enrollment. Year 3 FFQs were used to calculate a DII change score. Fractures were reported at least annually; hip fractures were confirmed by medical records. Hazard ratios for fractures were computed using multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models, further stratified by age and race/ethnicity. Pairwise comparisons of changes in hip BMD, measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry from baseline, year 3, and year 6 were analyzed by quartile (Q 1 = least inflammatory diet) of baseline <b>DII</b> <b>scores</b> in a subgroup of women (n = 10, 290). Mean DII score improved significantly over 3 years (p 3 ̆c 0. 01), but change was not associated with fracture risk.

40|$|This project {{sought to}} test the role of diet-related {{inflammation}} in modulating the risk of oesophageal cancer. A nationwide population-based case-control study was conducted from 1 December 1994 through 31 December 1997 in Sweden. All newly diagnosed patients with adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus or gastroesophageal junction and a randomly selected half of patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma were eligible as cases. Using the Swedish Registry of the Total Population, the control group was randomly selected from the entire Swedish population and frequency-matched on age (within 10  years) and sex. The literature-derived dietary inflammatory index (DII) was developed to describe the inflammatory potential of diet. <b>DII</b> <b>scores</b> were computed based on a food frequency questionnaire. Higher <b>DII</b> <b>scores</b> indicate more pro-inflammatory diets. Odds ratios and 95  % confidence intervals (CI) were computed to assess risk associated between <b>DII</b> <b>scores</b> and oesophageal cancer using logistic regression adjusted by potential confounders. In total, 189 oesophageal adenocarcinomas, 262 gastroesophageal junctional adenocarcinomas, 167 oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas, and 820 control subjects were recruited into the study. Significant associations with DII were observed for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ORQuartile 4 vs 1 4. 35, 95  % CI 2. 24, 8. 43), oesophageal adenocarcinoma (ORQuartile 4 vs 1 3. 59, 95  % CI 1. 87, 6. 89), and gastroesophageal junctional adenocarcinoma (ORQuartile 4 vs 1 2. 04, 95  % CI 1. 24, 3. 36).

We investigated whether higher dietary inflammatory index (<b>DII)</b> <b>scores</b> were associated with higher incidence of frailty in a cohort of North Americans. Design: Longitudinal, with a follow-up of 8 years. Setting: Osteoarthritis Initiative. Participants: A total of 4421 participants with, or at high risk of, knee osteoarthritis. Measurements: <b>DII</b> <b>scores</b> were calculated using the validated Block Brief 2000 Food-Frequency Questionnaire and categorized into sex-specific quartiles. Frailty was defined as 2 out of 3 of the criteria of the Study of Osteoporotic Fracture study (ie, weight loss, inability to rise from a chair 5 times, and poor energy).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Chronic, low-grade {{inflammation}} is {{an established}} {{risk factor for}} cardiovascular disease. The inflammatory impact of diet can be reflected by concentrations of inflammatory markers in the bloodstream and the inflammatory potential of diet can be estimated by the dietary inflammatory index (DII(TM)), which {{has been associated with}} cardiovascular disease risk in some previous studies. We aimed to examine the association between the DII and the risk of first myocardial infarction (MI) in a population-based study with long follow-up. METHOD: We conducted a prospective case-control study of 1389 verified cases of first MI and 5555 matched controls nested within the population-based cohorts of the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study (NSHDS), of which the largest is the ongoing Västerbotten Intervention Programme (VIP) with nearly 100 000 participants during the study period. Median follow-up from recruitment to MI diagnosis was 6. 4  years (6. 2 for men and 7. 2 for women). <b>DII</b> <b>scores</b> were derived from a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) administered in 1986 - 2006. Multivariable conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI), using quartile 1 (most anti-inflammatory diet) as the reference category. For validation, general linear models were used to estimate the association between the <b>DII</b> <b>scores</b> and two inflammatory markers, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin 6 (IL- 6) in a subset (n[*]=[*] 605) of the study population. RESULTS: Male participants with the most pro-inflammatory <b>DII</b> <b>scores</b> had an increased risk of MI [ORQ 4 vsQ 1 [*]=[*] 1. 57 (95 % CI 1. 21 - 2. 02) P trend[*]=[*] 0. 02], which was essentially unchanged after adjustment for potential confounders, including cardiovascular risk factors [ORQ 4 vsQ 1 [*]=[*] 1. 50 (95 % CI 1. 14 - 1. 99), P trend[*]=[*] 0. 10]. No association was found between DII and MI in women. An increase of one DII score unit was associated with 9 % higher hsCRP (95 % CI 0. 03 - 0. 14) and 6 % higher IL- 6 (95 % CI 0. 02 - 0. 11) in 605 controls with biomarker data available. CONCLUSION: A pro-inflammatory diet was associated with an elevated risk of first myocardial infarction in men; whereas for women the relationship was null.

40|$|Arterial wall thickening, {{stimulated by}} low-grade {{systemic}} inflammation, underlies many cardiovascular events. As diet {{is a significant}} moderator of systemic inflammation, the dietary inflammatory index (DIITM) has recently been devised to assess the overall inflammatory potential of an individual’s diet. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to assess the association of the DII with common carotid artery–intima-media thickness (CCA–IMT) and carotid plaques. To substantiate the clinical importance of these findings we assessed the relationship of DII score with atherosclerotic vascular disease (ASVD) -related mortality, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease (CVA) -related mortality and ischaemic heart disease (IHD) -related mortality more. The study was conducted in Western Australian women aged over 70 years (n 1304). Dietary data derived from a validated FFQ (completed at baseline) were used to calculate a DII score for each individual. In multivariable-adjusted models, <b>DII</b> <b>scores</b> were associated with sub-clinical atherosclerosis: a 1 sd (2 · 13 units) higher DII score was associated with a 0 · 013 -mm higher mean CCA–IMT (P= 0 · 016) and a 0 · 016 -mm higher maximum CCA–IMT (P= 0 · 008), measured at 36 months. No relationship was seen between DII score and carotid plaque severity. There were 269 deaths during follow-up. High <b>DII</b> <b>scores</b> were positively associated with ASVD-related death (per sd, hazard ratio (HR) : 1 · 36; 95 % CI 1 · 15, 1 · 60), CVA-related death (per sd, HR: 1 · 30; 95 % CI 1 · 00, 1 · 69) and IHD-related death (per sd, HR: 1 · 40; 95 % CI 1 · 13, 1 · 75).

40|$|Summary: in this study, during 8 {{years of}} follow-up, we {{reported}} that higher dietary inflammatory index values {{were associated with}} {{a higher risk of}} incident fractures in women, but not in men, after adjusting for potential confounders. Introduction: inflammation is a key risk factor for many adverse outcomes in older people. While diet is a potential source of inflammation, {{little is known about the}} impact of inflammatory diet on fractures. Thus, we investigated whether higher Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) ™ ® scores are associated with fractures in a cohort of North American people. Methods: this longitudinal study with a follow-up of 8 years included 3648 participants (1577 males and 2071 females; mean age = 60. 6 years) with/at risk of knee osteoarthritis participating with in the Osteoarthritis Initiative. <b>DII</b> <b>scores</b> were calculated using the validated Block Brief 2000 Food Frequency Questionnaire, categorized into sex-specific quintiles. Information on fractures was obtained through self-reported history of fractures at hip, spine, and forearm. The relationship between baseline DII score and incident fracture was assessed through a Cox’s regression analysis, adjusted for potential baseline confounders, and reported as hazard ratios (HRs). Results: during 8 years of follow-up, 560 individuals developed fractures (15. 4 %). Adjusting for 10 potential confounders, women in the highest DII score quintile (i. e., most pro-inflammatory diet) had a significantly higher risk for fractures (HR = 1. 46; 95 % CI = 1. 02 – 2. 11) compared to women in the lowest quintile. An increase in one standard deviation of <b>DII</b> <b>scores</b> significantly predicted fracture onset in women (adjusted HR = 1. 14; 95 % CI = 1. 02 – 1. 27). The association between DII score and fractures was not significant among men or in the sample as whole.

40|$|Diet {{and chronic}} {{inflammation}} of the colon have been suggested to be risk factors {{in the development of}} colorectal cancer (CRC). The possible link between inflammatory potential of diet, measured through the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII®), and CRC has been investigated in several populations across the world. The aim {{of this study was to}} conduct a meta-analysis on studies exploring this association. Data from nine studies were eligible, of which five were case-control and four were cohort studies. Results from meta-analysis showed a positive association between increasing <b>DII</b> <b>scores,</b> indicating a pro-inflammatory diet, and CRC. Individuals in the highest versus the lowest (reference) DII category showed an overall 40 % increased risk of CRC with moderate evidence of heterogeneity [relative risk (RR) = 1. 40, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 26, 1. 55; I 2 = 69 %, p < 0. 001]. When analyzed as a continuous variable, results showed an increased risk of CRC of 7 % for a 1 -point increase in the DII score. Results remained unchanged when analyses were restricted to the four prospective studies. Results of our meta-analysis support the importance of adopting a healthier anti-inflammatory diet in preventing CRC.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Recently, a pro-{{inflammatory}} diet {{based on}} a dietary inflammatory index (DII) has been related to higher CVD risk in general population, but {{this has not been}} investigated among women. METHODS: We investigated the relationship between DII and risk of total CVD and CVD subgroups (myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, stroke and cerebrovascular disease) in a prospective cohort of 6972 Australian women aged 50 - 55 years at baseline in 2001. We used clinical and procedure information from inpatient hospital separation registries, information on use of health care services, and from the causes-of-death registry to ascertain CVD outcomes during 11 -year follow up. The association between baseline DII score and cardiovascular endpoints was analysed through cox-regression, with correction for demographic and cardiovascular risk factors. RESULTS: We identified 335 incident cases of CVD and 191 cases of ischaemic heart disease (including 69 myocardial infarctions) and 59 cases of cerebrovascular disease (including 40 cases of stroke). A statistically significant higher risk of myocardial infarction was observed in analyses using <b>DII</b> <b>scores</b> as a continuous variable with a hazard ratio of 1. 46 (95 % confidence interval 1. 12 - 1. 89), but this was attenuated by further adjustment for other known cardiovascular risk factors.

40|$|Background:Colorectal cancer, the thirdmost common {{cancer in}} theUnited States, has a natural history that usually {{encompasses}} several decades. Dietary components have {{been implicated in}} the etiology of colorectal cancer, perhaps through their effect on inflammation. Methods:We examined {{the ability of the}} dietary inflammatory index (DII) to predict colorectal cancer in the Iowa Women’s Health Study. The DII was computed based on dietary intake assessed by a 121 -item food frequency questionnaire in this cohort of 34, 703 women, ages 55 to 69 years, free of any self-reported prior malignancy at enrollment in 1986. Incident colorectal cancer cases were identified through linkage with the State Health Registry of Iowa (a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program member). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate HRs. Through the end of 2010, 1, 636 incident colorectal cancers were identified, including 1, 329 colon and 325 rectal cancers. Results: Multivariable analysis, adjusting for body mass index, smoking status, pack-years of smoking, hormone replacement therapy, education, diabetes, and total energy intake, revealed positive associations between higher DII and colorectal cancer risk [HR for DIIcontinuous: 1. 07 per unit increase in DII (corresponding to 0. 5 SD unit increase); 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 01 – 1. 13; HR for DIIquintiles: Q 5 vs. Q 1 1. 20; 95 % CI, 1. 01 – 1. 43]. HRs for DII were similar for colon cancer and rectal cancer, though not statistically significant for rectal cancer.
