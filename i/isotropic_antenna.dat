This thesis offers one possible approach to accomplish this task. It focuses on estimating the number of devices in a certain area based on monitoring and processing Wi-Fi metadata, which includes a received signal strength indicator. To accomplish this goal, four sensing devices are placed at the corners of a rectangular area. These sensing devices observe and record local data traffic, along with the received signal strength associated with each packet. For each sensing device, two types of frontends are considered, namely directional and <b>isotropic</b> <b>antennas.</b> Each sensing device retrieves the received signal strength indicators and the media access control addresses from the 802. 11 frames packets transmitted by nearby active wireless devices. The estimator takes the received signal strength indicators as input and infers the number of active Wi-Fi devices inside the area of interest. Two algorithms, bayesian and maximum-likelihood, are employed for estimation purposes. Overall performance is used to compare and contrast the systems implemented with directional <b>antennas</b> and <b>isotropic</b> <b>antennas,</b> respectively.

40|$|The {{advent of}} Wi-Fi {{infrastructures}} and wireless devices {{has changed the}} wireless landscape considerably. Of particular interest is Wi-Fi metadata, which provides information about the devices present in a wireless network and offers unintrusive ways in the inference of wireless device location and behavior. The Wi-Fi metadata of mobile devices {{can be obtained by}} deploying a network of monitoring devices over Wi-Fi. Monitoring devices consist of network interface cards in monitoring mode and are capable of listening to all Wi-Fi packets in the network traffic. This thesis examines the problem of estimating the occupancy of a region based on Wi-Fi metadata and compares the performance obtained with the data gathered by monitoring system with directional antennas to that of the same system with <b>isotropic</b> <b>antennas.</b> The monitoring antenna design is important because certain antenna radiation patterns can yield more discriminating information about current conditions. In this work, occupancy estimation is formulated as a classification problem, and logistic regression and radial basis function networks are employed as the classification schemes. The metadata from Wi-Fi packets combined with received signal strengths from the monitoring antennas act as input to the classifiers. This work considers a specific scenario of occupancy estimation. The classification performance of the system is assessed with the synthetic data at different noise levels in the RSSI values, and with the experimental data obtained from a testbed implementation. The field data are acquired in a line-of-sight environment. The findings indicate that the judiciously selected directional monitoring antennas work appropriately and significantly outperform the <b>isotropic</b> <b>antennas</b> in the scenario considered. This work introduces machine learning approaches for occupancy estimation based on Wi-Fi metadata and provides insight into the efficiency of directional <b>antennas</b> over <b>isotropic</b> <b>antennas</b> in the context of occupancy estimation. It also suggests that utilizing custom antenna designs based on the inference, shape and size of the target region can significantly improve the performance of a Wi-Fi monitoring system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The IEEE 802. 15. 3 is {{an ad hoc}} MAC layer {{suitable}} for multimedia WPAN applications and a PHY capable of data rates in excess of 20 Mbps. In 2. 4 GHz unlicensed band, IEEE 802. 15. 3 specifies data rates up to 55 MBPS. It basically employs an ad hoc PAN topology, with roles for “master ” and “slave ” devices. In this work, it needs to determine the delay in discovering the devices by Pico Net Controller (PNC) and the most efficient antenna pattern so as to achieve maximum throughput {{and as a result}} increase in the QoS. At the beginning of each super-frame, a network beacon is transmitted which carries WPAN-specific parameters, including power management, and information for new devices to join the ad hoc network. PNC sends beacons to various devices and the device, which accepts the beacon, sends an acknowledgment frame to PNC. When the devices are connected to PNC, the piconet is formed through which PNC and devices can communicate with each other. For the performance assessment of the wireless networks using antennas, baseline models of directional <b>antenna</b> and <b>isotropic</b> <b>antennas</b> have been developed using the simulator OPNET ModelerTM 12. 0.

Moreover, use of directional antennas at transmitter and receiver decreases in end-to-end delay. For simulation, licenc...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{extend the}} results of [1] on the {{capacity}} of singleuser-detection based wireless networks, and we determine the implications of our results on the scalability of such networks. In particular, we consider a wireless network of N nodes that are equipped with <b>isotropic</b> <b>antennas.</b> The nodes are stationary or moving arbitrarily in a network domain of an arbitrary one, two, or three dimensional shape, {{as opposed to the}} two dimensional circular domain in [1]. In this arbitrary dimensional setting, we derive bounds on the per node end-to-end throughput capacity and the maximum number of simultaneous transmissions whose SINRs exceed a given threshold. We derive these bounds with both the bounded propagation model in [1] and a large class of bounded propagation models, which we refer to as the general propagation model. Our results show that with the general propagation model, the maximum number of simultaneous transmissions, whose SINRs exceed the threshold has an upper bound that does not depend on N, andtheper node end-to-end throughput capacity is O(1 /N) for a large class of wireless networks. Moreover, we establish several required conditions for scalability. These conditions show that, for any propagation model, to achieve a desired per node end-to-end throughput as N grows, it is necessary to keep the average source-to-destination hop count bounded. Also, for the particular propagation model of [1], we show that the size of the network domain must grow with N at a rate that depends on the dimension of the network domain and the path loss exponent.

30|$|In a CRN {{with energy}} detectors, the RSF {{attacker}} must limit the rogue antenna’s coverage {{in order to}} avoid a successful PUE. Directional antennas make it possible to isolate its radiation pattern to a targeted group of sensors (with the rest of the network unaffected), thus convincing the FC that the defecting sensors are malicious. On the other hand, <b>isotropic</b> <b>antennas</b> emit RF waves in all directions and maximize the antenna’s coverage. This leaves a massive RF finger print in a network of energy detectors.

However, this scheme was not tested or tailored for pinpointing directional antennas.|$|R
