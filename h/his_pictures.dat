5|$|At one point, {{the prices}} for <b>his</b> <b>pictures</b> were {{exceeded}} only {{by those of}} renowned English artists Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough. Despite his many commissions, however, Stuart was habitually neglectful of finances and {{was in danger of}} being sent to debtors' prison. In 1787, he fled to Dublin, Ireland where he painted and accumulated debt with equal vigor.|$|E
5|$|From {{an early}} age Bauer had to adapt his {{illustrations}} to contemporary printing technique. Full-color was expensive, so the illustrations were made in one color plus black. As the process developed and his works became in greater demand, <b>his</b> <b>pictures</b> were eventually printed in full color.|$|E

5|$|In 1911, when Bauer {{again was}} asked to {{illustrate}} the book, {{he made it clear}} to the publisher that he wanted to retain <b>his</b> <b>pictures</b> along with the copyrights after publication. The publishing house had kept the original illustrations for the previous editions and considered them their property. Bauer was backed up in his request by other artists facing the same problem. The publishers did not budge from their position and without Bauer's illustrations, book sales dropped.|$|E
5|$|The Iranian film {{director}} Abbas Kiarostami {{is known for}} uses of certain themes and cinematic techniques that are instantly recognizable in his work, {{from the use of}} child protagonists and stories that take place in rural villages, to conversations that unfold inside cars utilizing stationary mounted cameras. He often undertook a documentary style of filmmaking within narrative works, and frequently employs contemporary Iranian poetry in dialogue, movie titles, and in the thematic elements of <b>his</b> <b>pictures.</b>|$|E
5|$|The most noted of Bauer's {{pictures}} are his watercolors, the technique he used when illustrating for books and magazines; he alternated between aquarelle and gouache. When he created illustrations the two mediums were sometimes mixed, since he needed both {{the speed of}} the aquarelle and the contrast and impasto that the gouache provided. These water-soluble, and fast drying, media allowed Bauer to work on <b>his</b> <b>pictures</b> until the last minute before deadline, something he was prone to do.|$|E

5|$|Writing in 1841 in {{the journal}} Kunstblatt, Passavant gave an account of how the panels were bought at auction from either a Spanish monastery or convent. The Russian diplomat Dmitry Tatishchev {{acquired}} the panels, possibly from a Spanish convent or monastery near Madrid or Burgos, while living in Spain between 1814 and 1821. Tatishchev left <b>his</b> <b>pictures</b> to Tsar Nicholas I in 1845, and they came into the possession of the Hermitage Gallery in Saint Petersburg in 1917.|$|E
5|$|As {{she grew}} older Betsy {{suffered}} from numerous illnesses, the exact natures {{of which are}} not recorded but which {{are known to have}} caused William great concern. William began to become paranoid that Betsy would marry and leave his service, in 1835 going as far as to have her sign an affidavit that she would never leave him. In 1843 his older brother Charles, a successful planter in Java, returned to England after over 30 years abroad. William became deeply suspicious that Betsy was becoming too close to Charles, a suspicion intensified when Charles took her on a visit to Holland and the Rhine; Charles returned to Java in 1845. In around 1844 Betsy struck up a close relationship with the pen manufacturer and art collector Joseph Gillott, one of William's regular customers who owned some of <b>his</b> <b>pictures.</b> Gillott was married with children, and the closeness of their relationship caused William concern. In 1848, William retired to York leaving Betsy alone in his London apartment; although aware that Betsy was considering marriage he was confident that he could persuade her to come to York and live with him in his retirement. Betsy did eventually join him in York, and was present at his death.|$|E

25|$|By 1957 {{his work}} had {{registered}} a certain surreal quality. Figures and objects appear to float {{in space and}} <b>his</b> <b>pictures</b> are populated by images removed from their contexts. The fantastic vein remains at least until 1964.|$|E
