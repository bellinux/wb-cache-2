5|$|The alleged {{death of}} Moreno González was {{considered}} one of the most significant government victories since the start of the <b>drug</b> <b>war</b> in 2006. La Familia Michoacana was the focus of the government because their stronghold, Michoacán state, is approximately four hours away from the country's capital, Mexico City. In addition, Michoacán is the homestate of former President Felipe Calderón, who made it a top priority to pacify it.|$|E
5|$|Several {{tropical}} cyclone warnings and watches were posted {{in anticipation of}} the storm. Upon the development of Ingrid into a {{tropical cyclone}} at 2100UTC on September12, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Coatzacoalcos to Nautla, Veracruz. At 1500UTC on September13, the tropical storm warning was extended northward to Cabo Rojo, Veracruz, with a tropical storm watch northward to La Pesca, Tamaulipas. Later, a hurricane warning was issued between Cabo Rojo to La Pesca, with a tropical storm watch to Bahia Algodones, Tamaulipas. Pemex, the oil company operated by the Mexican government, evacuated workers from three platforms in the Gulf of Mexico due to the storm. In Tamaulipas, classes were canceled in 27municipalities, and all classes were temporarily canceled throughout Veracruz. The threat of the storm caused events for Mexican Independence Day to be canceled. After a restriction on the news in 2010 due to the local <b>drug</b> <b>war,</b> members of a citizen alert system in Tamaulipas used Twitter to notify about flooding, missing people, and the need for assistance.|$|E

40|$|War {{is a form}} of {{competition}} and the <b>drug</b> <b>wars</b> are no exception to this definition. <b>Drug</b> <b>wars</b> are actually classic illustrations of competitors abusing the legal process to define their own drug trading as lawful while characterizing their competitor's behaviour as “crime”. Successive American federal administrations extended the <b>drug</b> <b>wars</b> through a combination of military assistance, financial pressure and secret agreements. These aggressions are the real abuses aimed at third world cultures. Since Americans purchase 60 % of all illicit drugs and finance more than 90 % of the police action against the trade, drug legalization drug crusade.

25|$|The <b>drug</b> <b>war</b> of the 2000s {{has seen}} battles here. For example, federal police {{tried to stop}} two {{vehicles}} on Highway 200 in the municipality as they matched the description of vehicles associated with suspected drug traffickers.

25|$|Ethnic prejudices {{have also}} {{emerged in the}} <b>drug</b> <b>war,</b> and poor and {{helpless}} indigenous communities have been targeted by the police, military, drug traffickers and the justice system.

40|$|The major {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyse the impact of the 2003 <b>war</b> on <b>drugs</b> policy on imprisonment and the prison social world in Thailand. While most studies on the <b>drugs</b> <b>war</b> have focused mainly on the quantitative increase in the prison population in the penal systems as the policy’s main impact, this research further examined the social shifts in Thai prisons driven by the <b>drugs</b> <b>war.</b> The data were qualitatively collected and analysed through documentary analysis, observations and in-depth interviews with forty-six participants: the former Director Generals of The Corrections Department, prison inmates, prison officers, and prison directors from Bangkwang Central Prison, Klongprem Central Prison, The Central Correctional Institution for Drug-addicts and The Women’s Correctional Institution for Drug-addicts. Although the Thai government declared a victory in the <b>drugs</b> <b>war</b> by claiming that the drug business had almost been eradicated due to the decrease in the size of the prison population and in the number of drug case arrests, in reality some changes caused by the <b>drugs</b> <b>war</b> within the prison world have been overlooked. The findings of this thesis reveal that the <b>war</b> on <b>drugs</b> produced significant effects upon various spheres of imprisonment. By dividing the framework into several levels for analysis focusing on prison inmates, prison officers and the social relationships behind bars, the lives and experiences of prisoners and prison officers are shown to have been effected in a negative and tougher way. Besides, there have been changes in social relations among prisoners and between inmates and prison officers. Crucially, the key factor leading to the policy impact was the replacement by the more powerful drug dealers in Thai prisons for drug users, due to the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act B. E. 2545 (2002), which was a significant feature of the 2003 <b>drugs</b> <b>war...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a dynamic competition game among three players, where each player can vary {{the extent of}} his competition on a per-rival basis. We call such competition targeted. We show that if the players are myopic, the weaker players eventually lose the game to their strongest rival. If instead the players are sufficiently far-sighted, then all three players converge in their power and stay in the game. We develop our model in application to <b>drug</b> <b>wars,</b> but the approach of targeted competition can be applied to competition between firms or political parties, or to warfare.
