5|$|The primary playable {{character}} in Hatoful Boyfriend {{is the human}} protagonist, a boisterous hunter-gatherer {{who lives in a}} cave in the wilderness. Her eight potential love interests in the original version of the game, who together form the rest of the main cast, are Ryouta Kawara, a rock dove and the protagonist's sickly but hardworking childhood friend; Sakuya Le Bel Shirogane, a fantail pigeon and snobbish French aristocrat; Sakuya's older half-brother Yuuya Sakazaki, a popular and flirtatious but strangely secretive fantail pigeon; Nageki Fujishiro, a quiet, bookish mourning dove who never seems to leave the library; San Oko, an athletic, hyperactive fantail pigeon who is obsessed with pudding; Anghel Higure, an eccentric Luzon bleeding-heart who behaves as if <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> some kind of fantasy role-playing game; Kazuaki Nanaki, a kind but narcoleptic button quail and the protagonist's homeroom teacher; and Shuu Iwamine, a creepy, antisocial chukar partridge who serves as the school's doctor. Azami Koshiba, a no-nonsense Java sparrow and takoyaki saleswoman, became a possible love interest in the 2014 remake.|$|E
25|$|In July, {{some reports}} say that Brocius ambushed a Mexican trail herd in {{what became known}} as the Skeleton Canyon Massacre. Six vaqueros were killed and the {{remainder}} captured, then possibly tortured and murdered. Curly Bill reportedly sold the Mexican beef he stole to Newman Haynes Clanton the next month. When Old Man Clanton was on the trail herding the beef to Tombstone, four others and <b>he</b> <b>were,</b> <b>in</b> turn, ambushed in the Guadalupe Canyon Massacre and murdered by Mexicans. No contemporary reports of Curly Bill's involvement in these episodes were verified, and Brocius was not charged with any crimes related to these events.|$|E
25|$|Locke {{and his men}} {{transport}} Ser Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth to Harrenhal. Along the way, Brienne and Jaime bicker {{about their}} capture, Brienne chides Jaime for his poor swordplay, and Jaime anticipates the men will try to rape Brienne, suggesting she submit to their advances or face being killed. However, he concedes that if <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> Brienne's position he would make the men kill him. At camp for the night, when Locke's men attempt to rape Brienne, Jaime convinces Locke that Brienne's father is rich and would pay ransom to have her back chaste and unharmed. Locke believes Jaime's story and stops the men from raping Brienne. However, Jaime then tries to secure his own release, promising Locke that his father Tywin will reward him with gold and titles if he is returned to him. Locke feigns acceptance but is actually offended by Jaime's offer, sneers that Jaime is powerless without his father, and drives home the point by severing Jaime's right hand, his sword hand.|$|E

25|$|In 1894 Hackett {{was elected}} to the Legislative Council as {{representative}} of the south-western province, and held this seat until his death. He was a delegate to the 1891 and 1897 Federal conventions, and was appointed a member of the constitutional committee. He was asked to join more than one ministry, but had to decline as it was impossible for him to add to the work he was already doing. He was also of the opinion that, as a newspaper editor, he would {{no longer be able to}} speak with the same freedom if <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> office. He advocated women's suffrage, and Western Australia was one of the early jurisdictions to give women the vote. He also strongly supported Forrest in his development policy, in the building of the pipe line to the goldfields, and the making of Fremantle harbour. He was interesting himself very much in the Perth public library, museums, and national gallery of which he became president, and also in the proposed university. He was a prominent member of the Church of England, holding the offices of registrar of the Diocese of Perth and chancellor of St George's Cathedral. He declined a knighthood in 1902 but accepted it in 1911, and two years later was created KCMG.|$|E
25|$|In {{his later}} life and career, Liao Hua {{actively}} {{participated in the}} Shu campaigns (Zhuge Liang's Northern Expeditions and Jiang Wei's Northern Expeditions) against Wei. One of his most celebrated moments came in Chapter 103, when Sima Yi was retreating from Shangfang Valley. Liao Hua pursued the fleeing general into a dense forest and, being a proficient horseman, was able to catch up and {{get close enough to}} strike him down. However, when Sima Yi swerved around a tree, Liao Hua missed the shot and his sword became lodged into the wood, allowing Sima Yi to escape. During the chase, however, Sima Yi dropped his golden helmet. Liao Hua took the helmet and traveled back to Zhuge Liang who rewarded him with the first grade of merit for his attempt. This event angered Wei Yan who felt Liao Hua was being unfairly praised. Zhuge Liang noticed this but said nothing, leading to a mild distaste for Wei Yan's jealousy. The helmet was henceforth used as a means of mocking and provoking the Wei army. Following Zhuge Liang's death, Liao Hua moved up the ranks under Jiang Wei, eventually receiving the second-in-command military rank of General of Chariots and Cavalry. As Jiang Wei's senior general, Liao Hua was often tasked with the most important of duties, such as leading the vanguard and dueling enemy generals. Despite his steadfast loyalty to Shu, Liao Hua disagreed with Jiang Wei's constant invasions of Wei and his attempts to claim victory through overpowering numbers, believing these tactics to be a drain on resources and morale; he {{let it be known that}} he would run the military differently if <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> command, and this led to quarrels between Jiang Wei and himself. When Liu Shan eventually submitted to Wei in Chapter 119, Liao Hua succumbed to grief and died.|$|E

500|$|Universal {{makeup artist}} Jack Pierce paid special {{attention}} to the Monster's appearance in this film. He altered his 1931 design to display the after-effects of the mill fire, adding scars and shortening the Monster's hair. Over the course of filming, Pierce modified the Monster's makeup to indicate that the Monster's injuries were healing as the film progressed. Pierce co-created the Bride's makeup with strong input from Whale, especially regarding the Bride's iconic hair style, based on Nefertiti. Lanchester's hair was given a Marcel wave over a wire frame to achieve the style. Lanchester disliked working with Pierce, who she said [...] "really did feel that he made these people, like he was a god... in the morning he'd be dressed in white as if <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> hospital to perform an operation." [...] To play Mary Shelley, Lanchester wore a white net dress embroidered with sequins of butterflies, stars, and moons, which the actress had heard required 17 women 12 weeks to make.|$|E

2500|$|The precise {{relationship}} between Plato and Socrates remains {{an area of}} contention among scholars.

The characters in 20X6 cartoons each have a counterpart in the Homestar Runner universe, and their features are {{a parody of}} anime and Japanese video game stereotypes. The game of the same name was heavily based on the Mega Man series, particularly the first 6 levels. Stinkoman's name comes from a conversation Homestar Runner and Strong Bad had while marooned on a desert island. Strong Bad created Stinkoman by applying several anime stereotypes (head shaped like a little bean, big shiny eyes, shiny body, mouth that is tiny when closed and huge when opened, blue hair, and robot boots) to his own appearance.|$|E
