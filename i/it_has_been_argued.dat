50|$|<b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> by Dr. Manmohan Singh and {{his party}} that the nuclear {{infrastructure}} needed to be developed more rapidly because the existing electric generation facilities were incapable of meeting growing demand.|$|R
5000|$|<b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> {{before the}} Divisional Court that the phrase “any other warrant” in Section 2(4)(b) of the 2003 Act should include European arrest warrants. This {{argument}} was rejected {{on the basis}} of five points: ...|$|R
5000|$|In the appeal, <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> by Quebec that interjurisdictional {{immunity}} did {{not apply}} where a law raises a double aspect.

5|$|Hill forts {{developed}} in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age, roughly {{the start of the}} first millenniumBC. The reason for their emergence in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture.|$|E
5|$|In practice, the MSE is a {{blend of}} empathic {{descriptive}} phenomenology and empirical clinical observation. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> that the term phenomenology has become corrupted in clinical psychiatry: current usage, as a set of supposedly objective descriptions of a psychiatric patient (a synonym for signs and symptoms), is incompatible with the original meaning which was concerned with comprehending a patient's subjective experience.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> {{variously}} {{that the}} Eskaya are {{a remnant of}} the original indigenous settlers on Bohol; that they migrated to Bohol from Sumatra {{in the seventh century}} A.D.; that they are descendants of the resistance groups that fought under Francisco Dagohoy; that they are a cult or secret society; or that they are a conscious reconstruction of an imagined pre-colonial society.|$|E
25|$|For a {{long time}} <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> that Eichendorff's view of Romanticism <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{subordinate}} to religious beliefs. More recently, however, Christoph Hollender has pointed that Eichendorff's late religious and political writings were commissioned works, while his poetry represents a highly personal perspective.|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Gartnait son of Áedán could be the same person as Gartnait son of Domelch, king of the Picts, whose death is reported around 601, but this rests on the idea of Pictish matriliny, which has been criticised. Even less certainly, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> that Gartnait's successor in the Pictish king-lists, Nechtan, was his grandson, and thus Áedán's great-grandson.|$|E
5|$|Other {{commentators}} {{have suggested that}} the manner of St Edmund's death, veneration and culthood define him as a sacral king. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> that St Edmund's story was informed by common Celtic and Germanic notions of sacred kingship. Comparable kings who also embodied theories of divinely-ordained rule, rightful sovereignty and the binding links between king, land and society, include: Conaire Mór, Cormac mac Cuilennáin, King Dómaldi and Halfdan the Black.|$|E
5|$|The Roman era of Switzerland is {{traditionally}} held to have ended in 401AD, when Stilicho withdrew all {{troops from the}} Rhine and the Danube. However, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> that the withdrawal was only temporary and partial, and that Roman control of these rivers was reestablished in 411–413 {{with the assistance of}} tribes moving south from Germania.|$|E

50|$|At the Supreme Court, <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> {{that the}} fifth point was flawed {{and that there}} was a purpose to {{requiring}} evidence of any other EAWs, even if withdrawn, in that they could constitute the basis of, or be relevant to, a decision by the executing court to set side (or consider whether to set aisde) the subsisting EAW as an abuse of process.|$|R
5|$|After Adolf Hitler came {{to power}} in January 1933, Piłsudski is rumored to have {{proposed}} to France a preventive war against Germany. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> that Piłsudski may have been sounding out France regarding possible joint military action against Germany. Lack of French interest may have been a reason why Poland signed the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of January 1934. Little evidence has, however, been found in French or Polish diplomatic archives that such a proposal for preventive war was ever actually advanced.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the turn}} of the millennium, the Arabic {{astronomer}} and polymath Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen) presented a development of Ptolemy's geocentric epicyclic models in terms of nested spheres. Despite the similarity of this concept to that of Ptolemy's Planetary Hypotheses, al-Haytham's presentation differs in sufficient detail that <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> that it reflects an independent development of the concept. In chapters 15–16 of his Book of Optics, Ibn al-Haytham also said that the celestial spheres do not consist of solid matter.|$|E
5|$|Ethnographies also caution against over-interpretation of sites. At {{a site in}} Chaco Canyon can {{be found}} a {{pictograph}} with a star, crescent and hand. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> by some astronomers {{that this is a}} record of the 1054 Supernova. However recent reexaminations of related 'supernova petroglyphs' raises questions about such sites in general and anthropological evidence suggests other inrepretations. The Zuni people, who claim a strong ancestral affiliation with Chaco, marked their sun-watching station with a crescent, star, hand and sundisc, similar to those found at the Chaco site.|$|E
40|$|In {{the actual}} train of events, {{it would be}} a utopia for the {{economical}} agent to avoid the incertitude. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> that the dimension of this phenomenon knows two extremes: once it is a generator of anxiety but then also a strong motivator regarding the knowledge, innovation and production. The cause of this hazard are numerous, two of them are here reflected. incertitude, financial prevision, risk...|$|R
50|$|Ptahhotep Desher {{is mainly}} known from is mastaba (C6) at Saqqara. The mastaba {{was built in}} one unit with the mastaba of another vizier, who was also called Ptahhotep. They were perhaps brothers. In both mastabas were not found any {{inscriptions}} providing a clue for a dating. On observations on {{the style of the}} architecture <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> that they date to the reign of Menkauhor and Djedkare Isesi.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> also <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> that Deng Xiaoping's post-Mao {{policies}} {{were inspired by}} List, as well as recent policies in India.|$|R
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued,</b> however, {{that there}} exists a problem if a {{government}} minister simply needs to state that a national security interest {{is involved in a}} matter, upon which the rules of natural justice are immediately compromised. Thio Li-ann has commented that when important constitutional rights such as the freedom to religion are curtailed by legislation, it may be advisable for the court to impose a duty on a public authority to give reasons establishing that an order imposed by the authority is objectively valid.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Fordun's account of the Battle of Mortlach {{is due to a}} distortion of local tradition. Mortlach is nearby the site of the battle in which Máel Coluim mac Donnchada (Malcolm III) wrested power from Lulach. Máel Coluim's first wife, Ingibiorg Finnsdottir, was the niece of Harald III of Norway, and <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> by Alex Woolf that the tradition of a battle between the Scots and Norwegians is due to a Scandinavian involvement on the side of Máel Coluim.|$|E
5|$|Likely of Balkan origin, Basiliscus was {{the brother}} of Aelia Verina, wife of Leo I. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> that Basiliscus was uncle to the {{chieftain}} of the Heruli, Odoacer. This link {{is based on the}} interpretation of a fragment by John of Antioch (209.1), which states that Odoacer and Armatus, Basiliscus' nephew, were brothers. However, not all scholars accept this interpretation, since sources do not say anything about the foreign origin of Basiliscus. It is known that Basiliscus had a wife, Zenonis, and at least one son, Marcus.|$|E

5|$|The Cambodian {{government}} was not informed of the incursion until it was already under way. The Cambodian leadership however welcomed the intervention against PAVN bases and the resulting weakening of PAVN military capabilities. The leadership had hoped for permanent US occupation of the PAVN sanctuaries because FANK and ARVN forces were unable to fill the vacuum in these territories following US withdrawal. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> by some scholars that the incursion heated up {{the civil war and}} helped the insurgent Khmer Rouge gather recruits to their cause.|$|E
5|$|While <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> {{that the}} damage {{attributed}} to this storm {{may have been}} caused by an earthquake following the Thera Eruption, it has also been suggested that it was caused during a war with the Hyksos, and the storm reference is merely a metaphor for chaos upon which the Pharaoh was attempting to impose order. Documents such as Hatshepsut's Speos Artemidos depict storms, but are clearly figurative not literal. Research indicates that the Speos Artemidos stele is a reference to her overcoming the powers of chaos and darkness.|$|E
5|$|A weary emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, discontent among ruling circles who were dismissive of the Imperial role in {{national}} affairs: all seemed to presage the monarchy's impending doom. Nevertheless, Pedro II was unconcerned that times and conditions were changing. After more than five decades on the throne, he had become complacent in a belief that the devotion and support of his subjects was immutable. Because of these factors, and the lack of an energetic response on the part of Pedro II, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> that prime responsibility for the monarchy's overthrow rested with the Emperor himself.|$|E
2500|$|After Parliament {{relocated}} {{to the new}} building, there was a debate on whether to demolish Old Parliament House. [...] During the 1920s <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> by some, including Walter Burley Griffin, that the building's position would interfere with the vista of a permanent Parliament House. Burley Griffin had likened {{the placement of the}} Old Parliament House to 'filling the front yard with outhouses' as the building would interfere with the land axis from Mount Ainslie to Capital Hill.|$|R
50|$|Neurotrophic {{factors are}} {{molecules}} which promote and regulate neuronal {{survival in the}} developing nervous system. They are distinguished from ubiquitous metabolites necessary for cellular maintenance and growth by their specificity; each neurotrophic factor promotes the survival of only certain kinds of neurons during a particular stage of their development. In addition, <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> that neurotropihic factors are involved in many other aspects of neuronal development ranging from axonal guidance to regulation of neurotransmitter synthesis.|$|R
