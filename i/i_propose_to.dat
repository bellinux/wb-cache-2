25|$|Stalin is too rude, {{and this}} fault, fully {{tolerable}} {{in our midst}} and in the relations among us Communists, becomes intolerable {{in the office of}} General Secretary. Therefore <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> <b>to</b> the comrades that they devise a way of shifting Stalin from this position and appointing to it another man who in all other respects falls {{on the other side of}} the scale from Comrade Stalin, namely, more tolerant, more loyal, more polite and considerate of comrades, less capricious and so forth.|$|E

25|$|It {{is at this}} point, the {{beginning}} of 1907, that <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> <b>to</b> bring this first volume to an end. The 25-year-old Picasso is about to conjure up a quintet of Dionysiac Demoiselles on his huge new canvas. The execution of this painting would make a dramatic climax to these pages. However, it would imply that Picasso's great revolutionary work constitutes a conclusion to all that has gone before. It does not. For all that the Demoiselles is rooted in Picasso's past, {{not to speak of}} such precursors as the Iron Age Iberians, El Greco, Gauguin and Cézanne, it is essentially a beginning: the most innovative painting since Giotto. As we will see in the next volume, it established a new pictorial syntax; it enabled people to perceive things with new eyes, new minds, new awareness. Les Demoiselles d'Avignon is the first unequivocally 20th-century masterpiece, a principal detonator of the modern movement, the cornerstone of 20th-century art. For Picasso it would also be a rite of passage: what he called an exorcism.' It cleared the way for cubism. It likewise banished the artist's demons. Later, these demons would return and require further exorcism. For the next decade, however, Picasso would feel as free and creative and 'as overworked' as God.|$|E
500|$|That morning, Buckner sent a {{messenger}} to the Union Army requesting an armistice and {{a meeting of}} commissioners to work out surrender terms. He may have been hoping Grant would offer generous terms, remembering the assistance he gave Grant when he was destitute, but Grant's reply was curt, with the famous quotation, [...] "No terms except unconditional and immediate surrender can be accepted. <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> <b>to</b> move immediately upon your works." [...] To this, Buckner responded: ...|$|E

500|$|In January 1916 a Washington D.C. billiard hall {{proprietor}} {{was fined}} $100 by a Police Court judge for allowing {{the game to}} be played at his establishment. The United States Attorney handling the case told reporters [...] "There is considerable playing of this Kelly pool in the poolrooms of the city, where many young men lose their entire week's wages on a single Saturday night, and <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> <b>to</b> have it stopped, if possible." [...] In April 1922, Charleston, West Virginia's then mayor, Grant P. Hall, declared [...] "baseball pools, pay-ball, Kelly pool and all other forms of gambling in billiard parlors and cigar stores must cease forthwith." [...] Likewise, in December of the same year, Oxford, Ohio's then mayor, J. M. Hughes, declared a war on all forms of gambling, announcing in the local newspaper that [...] "schemes of chance... Kelly pool... are contrary to law." [...] In 1934, sports promoter and notorious gambler Jack Doyle's billiard establishment was raided and he, along with 14 patrons, were arrested for placing bets on Kelly pool.|$|E
500|$|Union {{inaction}} {{created the}} opportunity for the Confederates to attack first before Buell arrived. On the morning of April 6, 1862, Grant's troops were taken by surprise when the Confederates, led by Generals Albert Sidney Johnston and P.G.T. Beauregard, struck first [...] "like an Alpine avalanche" [...] near Shiloh church, attacking five divisions of Grant's army and forcing a confused retreat toward the Tennessee River. Johnston was wounded and died during the engagement and command fell upon Beauregard. One Union line held the Confederate attack off for several hours at a place later called the [...] "Hornet's Nest", giving Grant time to assemble artillery and 20,000 troops near Pittsburg Landing. The Confederates finally broke through the Hornet's Nest to capture a Union division, but [...] "Grant's Last Line" [...] held Pittsburg Landing, while the exhausted Confederates, lacking reinforcements, halted their advance. That evening, heavy rain set in while Grant and his staff took cover and huddled around a fire. When asked by McPherson {{if he was going}} to retreat, Grant replied, [...] "Retreat? No. <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> <b>to</b> attack them at daylight and whip them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rabinowitz {{suggests}} that [...] "In the proper reading of a novel, then, events which are portrayed {{must be treated}} as both 'true' and 'untrue' at the same time. Although {{there are many ways}} to understand this duality, <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> <b>to</b> analyze the four audiences which it generates." [...] Similarly, Tamar Yacobi has proposed a model of five criteria ('integrating mechanisms') which determine if a narrator is unreliable. Instead of relying on the device of the implied author and a text-centered analysis of unreliable narration, Ansgar Nünning gives evidence that narrative unreliability can be reconceptualized in the context of frame theory and of readers' cognitive strategies.|$|E
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>propose</b> <b>to</b> {{create a}} heroic, monumental style of {{composition}} simple enough to inspire all people, completely free from fads, artificial mannerisms and false sophistications, direct, forceful, sincere, always original but never unnatural. [...] Music must be freed from decadence and stagnation. [...] There {{has been too}} much emphasis on small things while the great truths have been overlooked. The superficial must be dispensed with. [...] Music must become virile to express big things. [...] It is not my purpose to supply a few pseudo-intellectual musicians and critics with more food for brilliant argumentation, but rather to inspire all mankind with new heroism and spiritual nobility. [...] This may appear to be sentimental and impossible to some, but it must be remembered that Palestrina, Handel and Beethoven would not consider it either sentimental or impossible. [...] In fact, the worthiest creative art has been motivated consciously or unconsciously by the desire for the regeneration of mankind.|$|E

2500|$|Despite his reverses on May 10, Grant {{had reason}} for optimism. The one bright {{spot in the}} day had been the partial success of Emory Upton's {{innovative}} assault. He recognized the failure stemming {{from the lack of}} support and reasoned that using the same tactics with an entire corps might be successful. Grant was then visited by General Wright, the new commander of the VI Corps, who suggested that the May 10 assaults had failed due to poor support, particularly from Mott's division. Wright told General Meade, [...] "General, I don't want Mott's troops on my left; they are not a support. I would rather have no troops there." [...] He assigned Hancock's II Corps to the assault on the Mule Shoe, while Burnside's IX Corps attacked the eastern end of the salient and Warren's V Corps and Wright's VI Corps applied pressure to Laurel Hill. On the morning of May 11, Grant sent a famous message to the Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton: [...] "The result to this time is much in our favor. Our losses have been heavy {{as well as those of}} the enemy. ... <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> <b>to</b> fight it out on this line if it takes all summer." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1879, Simon Seller {{received}} a patent for a [...] "Toy Trumpet" [...] that {{worked on the}} same principle as a kazoo: [...] "By blowing through the tube A, {{and at the same}} time humming a sort of a head sound, a musical vibration is given to the paper covering c over the aperture b, and a sound produced pleasing to the ear." [...] Seller's [...] "toy trumpet" [...] was basically a hollow sheet-metal tube, with a rectangular aperture cut out along the length of the tube, with paper covering the aperture, and a funnel at the end, like the bell of a trumpet. [...] The first documented appearance of a kazoo was that created by an American inventor, Warren Herbert Frost, who named his new musical instrument kazoo in his patent #270,543 issued on January 9, 1883. The patent states, [...] "This instrument or toy, to which <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> <b>to</b> give the name 'kazoo' [...] "..." [...] Frost's kazoo did not have the streamlined, submarine shape of modern kazoos, but it was similar in that the aperture was circular and elevated above the length of the tube. The modern kazoo—also the first one made of metal—was patented by George D. Smith of Buffalo, New York, [...] May 27, 1902.|$|E
2500|$|The most fierce {{fighting}} that the 44th {{was engaged in}} during the raid occurred on October 23 at the Battle of Westport. Union General Blunt's position at the Wornall House was formidable. His three brigades occupied positions behind a stone wall, some three hundred yards {{in front of the}} Confederate line. A wide road, bordered on either side by stone walls, led to a farm house on top of a hill. In the road just over the hill there was a gun section of McLain's Colorado Battery in position and firing into the Confederate troops {{at the bottom of the}} hill. As the Confederate lines were reforming and being placed in position by Brigadier General Jo Shelby, Major General Fagan rode up at the head of his escort. Fagan looked at the battery a moment through his field glasses and said: [...] "Shelby, <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> <b>to</b> take that battery. Have a regiment of cavalry to form in platoons and charge up the line and support the charge on foot." [...] Colonel McGehee, commanding the 44th Arkansas, about three hundred strong, formed by platoons, which filled the lane with a living mass of cavalry. As the 44th Arkansas charged up the lane, Lieutenant Colonel Samuel Walker led the 16th Kansas Cavalry and 2nd Colorado Cavalry against Colonel McGehee. [...] Two squadrons of the 2nd Colorado under Green also struck the column's left. The 16th Kansas met them in the road, meanwhile Company E of the 15th Kansas Cavalry, struck across the field and reached the lower end of the lane, thus hemming in McGehee's troopers and intercepting any retreat.|$|E
