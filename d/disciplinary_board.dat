50|$|Generally speaking, most {{countries}} that follow {{the principles of}} common law have developed procedures for judicial review that limit the reviewability of decisions made by administrative law bodies.

Davis was furious that his unblemished 60-year career had been called into question by a <b>disciplinary</b> <b>board</b> and took up his case via association member Ian Doyle. Doyle offered an apology, but no official apology was given.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} if gender differences exist with respect to conviction of university students for academic dishonesty. To investigate this phenomenon, data from the Swedish National Agency for Higher Education (SNAHE) and from <b>disciplinary</b> <b>boards</b> of several Swedish universities were evaluated from a gender perspective. To identify whether the penalty severity for academic dishonesty is gender biased, the ratio of suspensions/warnings for male and female students was calculated. It was identified that female students are less prevalent in disciplinary matters and that there was no systematic gender bias in penalty severities (warnings or suspensions). In addition, female students deny academic dishonest behaviors more than male students, indicating a possibly higher false conviction rate...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To obtain {{insight into}} the {{contribution}} of the disciplinary code for nurses to monitoring the quality of nursing care in the Netherlands.

50|$|With {{tensions}} growing {{between the}} diocese {{and the larger}} Episcopal Church, the diocese's standing committee had passed two corporate resolutions on October 2, 2012, designed to conditionally disaffiliate the diocese from the Episcopal Church and call for a special diocesan convention. These resolutions were to take effect if the national church took disciplinary action against Bishop Lawrence or other diocesan leadership. On October 15, when Bishop Lawrence was notified of the <b>Disciplinary</b> <b>Board's</b> finding, diocesan leadership stated that the two resolutions were triggered. The special convention was held in Charleston at St. Philip’s Church on November 17, 2012. The convention affirmed the disassociation of the Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina from the national Episcopal Church, and amended the diocesan constitution and canons to remove all references to the Episcopal Church.|$|R

40|$|Aims A common {{understanding}} of 'rehabilitation' is {{the restoration of}} physical or mental functioning. However, sometimes the concept is applied by professional disciplinary bodies to restore poorly performing health practitioners to their former level of professional functioning. This article aims to research what 'rehabilitation' means, {{in the context of}} New Zealand law. Methods A range of cases were considered to assess what rehabilitation consists of, and when <b>disciplinary</b> <b>boards</b> choose to use it. Where discrepancies between decisions gave rise to questions, further analysis was carried out. Findings It can be seen that the New Zealand's disciplinary decisions do not appear consistent, particularly differing by profession. Nevertheless, a clearer approach is beginning to emerge, one which should become more so in the future. Conclusions Analysis of New Zealand's disciplinary decisions may contribute to the rich international research on professional regulation. Griffith Health FacultyFull Tex...|$|R

40|$|Social control {{mechanisms}} {{have become}} {{an important element of}} human medical research in the United States. At first largely intraprofessional, controls over human experimentation have moved increasingly in the direction of externally developed, bureaucratically administered, and formally sanctioned rules. This paper examines intra- and extraprofessional methods of control over biomedical science and reviews available research assessing their effectiveness in promoting researcher adherence to high ethical standards concerning the use of human subjects. Research suggests that intraprofessional controls (including medical training, peer influence, ethical codes, and <b>disciplinary</b> <b>boards),</b> are, on their own, inadequate to ensure investigator ethicality. However, studies examining external controls over biomedical research (government regulations, institutional review boards, judicial and state law), also suggest that extraprofessional regulations are often ineffective. Further study of both forms of scientific social control is needed, as well as research examining their interactive effects on investigators' ethical attitudes and practices. biomedical research regulation human subjects protection social control...|$|R
