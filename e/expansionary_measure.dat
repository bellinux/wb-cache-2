In order to evaluate more accurately Korea’s fiscal response since late 2008, this paper conducts an empirical analysis using historical data from Korea and other countries and derives stylized patterns on counter-cyclicality of fiscal policy {{and its role in}} the recovery process. The analysis suggests that Korea’s fiscal stimulus in 2009, while having contributed greatly to the economy’s fast recovery, was unusually large compared with typical fiscal responses during economic downturns. This paper also investigates whether the rapid increase in Korea’s fiscal debt burden is admissible in terms of long-term sustainability.

In this paper, we argue that criticisms of the Brüning government are misplaced. On the basis of asset prices, we infer that fear of inflation was widespread in 1931 / 32, limiting the room for manoeuvre. We conclude that the Britain's departure from gold – instead of facilitating such a step in Germany – actually made {{it much more difficult}} to adopt <b>expansionary</b> <b>measures,</b> because it increased uncertainty and fear of inflation...|$|R

This is partially because of the time frame, that does not include some of the <b>expansionary</b> <b>measures</b> introduced at the start of 2009 and only covers two and a half years, partly because some measures (e.g. changing indexation mechanisms in Germany and the United Kingdom, different calculation methods in Romania) will only reveal their full impact in the longer run, partly because changes were not quite that pronounced in {{a number of}} countries (at least not for these particular family types) and partly because the average obfuscates the impact of some policy changes on a limited number of family types.|$|R
40|$|During {{the global}} {{financial}} crisis 2007 – 2009 fiscal policy was widely used as a stabilization tool. Policymakers allowed a large build-up of public debt resulting from both automatic and discretionary <b>expansionary</b> <b>measures.</b> At the same time, calls for policy coordination stressed that international spillovers of fiscal policy might be sizeable. We reconsider the case for fiscal coordination by providing new evidence on the cross-border effects of discretionary fiscal measures. We rely on a vector autoregression model {{as well as on}} a quantitative business cycle model. We find that i) large spillover effects cannot be ruled out and, in contrast to conventional wisdom, ii) financial factors rather than trade flows {{lie at the heart of}} the international transmission mechanism. We discuss the implications of these results for policy coordination when markets price sovereign default risk, and put pressure on governments for implementing budget consolidation measures. ...|$|R
40|$|Growth of real GDP will {{amount to}} 1. 7 percent this year, once more undershooting the {{long-term}} average by a substantial margin. The main retarding element {{is the high}} energy prices which will drive up the rate of inflation, while weighing on consumption of private households. Exports will keep a strong momentum after their jump in 2004. The WIFO business survey of last September suggests a pick-up in industrial confidence. However, investment in machinery and equipment has so far failed to respond and is unlikely to reach the level of last year. Since May first 2005, economic policy has taken a number of <b>expansionary</b> <b>measures,</b> such as an increase in off-budget spending on infrastructure, in outlays {{for research and development}} as well as for active labour market policy. These measures will slightly accelerate the pace of growth in 2006 to a rate just above the euro area average. The implicit budgetary burden will, however, make for some increase in the general government deficit. ...|$|R
30|$|To this aim, we {{consider}} {{an adaptation of}} the model in Heidhues and Lagerlöf (2003) (hereafter HL), in which two office-seeker candidates receive imperfect and correlated signals {{on the state of}} the world, which is unknown to voters. 4 Following their specification {{we consider}} a binary world, with two states and two possible policies. For expositional purposes, and inspired by the current EU economic crisis, we identify the two policies as (1) an expansionary fiscal policy, that aims to stimulate aggregated demand through public spending; and (2) a policy of austerity, that aims to reduce budget deficits in order to foster the return of sustainable growth. Accordingly, in our words, the state of the world will be either pro-stimulus or pro-austerity. We assume that a policy consisting of <b>expansionary</b> <b>measures</b> or fiscal stimulus is the best fit for the economy if the state is pro-stimulus, and that an austerity policy is the appropriate one if the state is pro-austerity. 5 Following HL, we assume that the two mainstream candidates observe the signals and propose the policies so as to win office.|$|R
30|$|The crisis {{smashed the}} notion that people capable for work {{ought to be able}} to make a decent living if they are doing enough to find and accept work. The initial phase of the crisis did indeed trigger some changes for the better—expansionary and {{supportive}} measures were the general pattern. But as this paper shows, these changes proved short-lived. Retrenchment measures become evident later on in a substantial number of countries. Whereas the <b>expansionary</b> <b>measures</b> observed in the first crisis years generally centred on increases in benefits, retrenchment measures were more often enacted through more technical changes. Examples include as follows: skipping indexation, tightening the means test, abolishment or decrease of additional benefits (for instance child benefits). Few countries actually cut minimum income benefits. Moreover, with the exception of Hungary and Ireland, cuts were mainly part of a more encompassing reform that changed base rates as well as equivalence rates. This is broadly in line with the retrenchment literature where it is argued that retrenchment is often pursued through less visible, apparently technical changes.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{analyzes the}} patterns of fiscal and monetary policy in five economies of the Latin American Southern Cone (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay) during four episodes of international crises: 1994, 1997 - 1999, 2001 and 2008. In contrast with earlier episodes when most {{countries in the region}} applied procyclical fiscal and monetary policies, the response of the five countries to the 2008 crisis was countercyclical. On the fiscal side, countries had a larger fiscal space in 2008 to implement a countercyclical policy thanks to increases in primary balances, improvements in sustainability indicators and a reduction in financing needs in the years before the crisis. On the monetary side, the capacity to implement countercyclical policy was supported by a shift towards more flexible exchange rate regimes, and monetary policy regimes that enhanced transparency, reduced price volatility and increased the credibility of monetary authorities. For countries to be able to implement countercyclical responses in future crisis episodes, the fiscal authorities should reverse <b>expansionary</b> <b>measures</b> during good times and Central Banks should meet their inflation targets to preserve fiscal space and anchor inflation expectations. ...|$|R

Furthermore, the balance of payments was moving into deficit, with Britain’s share of world manufacturing falling dramatically as continental Europe, now grouped into the EEC, recovered from the effects of the war. In 1960 Britain suffered the worst balance of payments crisis since 1950, masked a little by the inflow of foreign money into London. The Treasury was already somewhat discredited. Bank Rate had already been raised to 6% by Lloyd's predecessor Heathcote Amory in June. Soon after his appointment, Lloyd asked Treasury economic advisor Robert Hall (29 July 1960) “how soon we were going bust”. On 16 March 1961 Lloyd wrote to Macmillan complaining that No 10 was briefing the press than Macmillan was in real charge of economic policy, and indeed policy in other areas. Also the German Deutschmark was revalued by 5% in March 1961, leading to worries that the pound sterling might crash in the summer of 1961.|$|R

500|$|In 1922 Keynes {{continued}} to advocate reduction of German reparations with A Revision of the Treaty. He attacked the post World War I deflation policies with A Tract on Monetary Reform in 1923 – a trenchant argument that countries should target stability of domestic prices, avoiding deflation {{even at the}} cost of allowing their currency to depreciate. Britain suffered from high unemployment through most of the 1920s, leading Keynes to recommend the depreciation of sterling to boost jobs by making British exports more affordable. From 1924 he was also advocating a fiscal response, where the government could create jobs by spending on public works. During the 1920s Keynes's pro stimulus views had only limited effect on policy makers and mainstream academic opinion – according to Hyman Minsky one reason was that at this time his theoretical justification was [...] "muddled". The Tract had also {{called for an end to}} the gold standard. Keynes advised it was no longer a net benefit for countries such as Britain to participate in the gold standard, as it ran counter to the need for domestic policy autonomy. It could force countries to pursue deflationary policies at exactly the time when <b>expansionary</b> <b>measures</b> were called for to address rising unemployment. The Treasury and Bank of England were still in favour of the gold standard and in 1925 they were able to convince the then Chancellor Winston Churchill to re-establish it, which had a depressing effect on British industry. Keynes responded by writing The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill and {{continued to}} argue against the gold standard until Britain finally abandoned it in 1931.|$|R
40|$|Not {{the least}} of inflation’s {{consequences}} is {{the damage done to}} the reputations of certain prominent economists. A case in point is John Maynard Keynes (1883 - 1946). Once highly regarded for his brilliant pathbreaking analysis of the causes of mass unem-ployment in the Great Depression of the 1930 s, he is now given low marks for his views on inflation. Popular folklore has it that he was largely uncon-cerned with inflation from the start, that his subse-quent preoccupation with unemployment led him to ignore it altogether, and that, as a result, he favored <b>expansionary</b> <b>measures</b> to eliminate unemployment regardless of their inflationary consequences. Since his death in 1946 his name (or at least the label “Keynesian”) has been linked to such inflationist slogans as “full employment at any cost ” and “money doesn’t matter. ” It has also found an association with the discredited concept of a stable enduring trade-off between inflation and unemployment {{as well as with the}} equally discredited notion that the au-thorities can peg interest rates and real economic activity at any desired level simply by manipulating the policy instruments they command. On the policy front his name is now popularly identified with ex-cessive government spending, mounting budget defi-cits, inflationary money growth; and, in Britain at least, with the idea that inflation can be contained with incomes policies and wage-price controls. In the textbooks, his views are caricatured in. the stylized “Keynes versus the monetarists ” manner as the opposite of the anti-inflationary views of the mone-tarists. Small wonder that he has been widely per-ceived as an inflationist and that our present inflation is often described as the legacy of Keynes. 1 The purpose of, this article, however, it to show that the foregoing perceptions are wrong: that far from being an inflationist, Keynes deplored inflation, warned repeatedly of its evils, and recommende...|$|R

50|$|Milanovic (2011) {{points out}} that overall, global {{inequality}} between countries {{is more important to}} growth of the world economy than inequality within countries. While global economic growth may be a policy priority, recent evidence about regional and national inequalities cannot be dismissed when more local economic growth is a policy objective. The recent financial crisis and global recession hit countries and shook financial systems all over the world. This led to the implementation of large-scale fiscal expansionary interventions and, as a result, to massive public debt issuance in some countries. Governmental bailouts of the banking system further burdened fiscal balances and raises considerable concern about the fiscal solvency of some countries. Most governments want to keep deficits under control but rolling back the <b>expansionary</b> <b>measures</b> or cutting spending and raising taxes implies an enormous wealth transfer from tax payers to the private financial sector. Expansionary fiscal policies shift resources and causes worries about growing inequality within countries. Moreover, recent data confirm an ongoing trend of increasing income inequality since the early nineties. Increasing inequality within countries has been accompanied by a redistribution of economic resources between developed economies and emerging markets. Davtyn, et al. (2014) studied the interaction of these fiscal conditions and changes in fiscal and economic policies with income inequality in the UK, Canada, and the US. They find income inequality has negative effect on economic growth {{in the case of the}} UK but a positive effect in the cases of the US and Canada. Income inequality generally reduces government net lending/borrowing for all the countries. Economic growth, they find, leads to an increase of income inequality in the case of the UK and to the decline of inequality in the cases of the US and Canada. At the same time, economic growth improves government net lending/borrowing in all the countries. Government spending leads to the decline in inequality in the UK but to its increase in the US and Canada.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{begins by}} arguing that the 2007 - 8 credit crunch {{does not require a}} {{fundamental}} re-evaluation of monetary policy. The crunch occurred because regulation was too lax, and we need to develop new and more effective tools of regulatory control. To focus on current account imbalances or mistakes in setting interest rates as a prime cause of the credit crunch is unconvincing, and has the danger of diverting attention away from the need to increase financial regulation. The current recession does require a re-evaluation of the role fiscal policy can play when interest rates hit a zero bound. An expansionary fiscal policy is required because monetary policy-makers are reluctant to promise higher future inflation, and the impact of quantitative easing is likely to be small. Although rising debt may place a limit on how much conventional fiscal policy can do, not all <b>expansionary</b> fiscal <b>measures</b> require additional borrowing. There are two important lessons for the future. First, although monetary policy should remain the primary tool to stabilize the business cycle, the combination of fiscal implementation lags and uncertainty means that some precautionary fiscal action may be appropriate during the early phase of some economic downturns. Second, to play this 'backstop' stabilization role effectively, a policy that results in the government debt-to-GDP ratio declining (albeit gradually and erratically) in normal times seems appropriate.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} understand {{the relationships between the}} evolving political economies and modes of public health governance in Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan from the 19 th century to nowadays. It is argued that from a political economy perspective, a suitable institutional set-up is important in providing political resources necessary for the evolution of public health governance. This dissertation looks specifically at political resources that include authority, legitimacy, finance and knowledge. The uneven distribution of these political resources across the polity determines the power gradient amongst different actors. Institutional set-up is also important because it governs the interaction between different actors who are in various ways dependent upon one another. From the 19 th century, the polity of these three jurisdictions experienced drastic change under the banner of colonialism. The colonial governments were preoccupied with advancement of colonial interest. With the unrest in the polity, the colonial governments realised the importance of authority and knowledge in perpetuating their existence. At the same time however, the ignorance towards cultural affinity of colonial subject deprived the governments of their ability to regulate the life of the latter. The contradiction was strongly reflected in the two British colonies where there were clashes over the application of public health law and regulation. Japan, by contrast, was more able to garner authority because of her tactics to couple traditional control with modern policing. In the post-war era, the political economy of these three jurisdictions departed from one another. In Hong Kong, the colonial set-up shifts from regulatory-led to developmental-led institutional set-up. Similar tendency can be observed in Singapore and continued after her independence. Bureaucratic authority became the most available resources for government to mobilise. In strong possession of authority and finance, the government was increasingly able to introduce <b>expansionary</b> <b>measures.</b> This is accompanied by the rise of rational planning in Hong Kong and Singapore. As a result, there witnessed bureaucratisation of public health governance which shaped the dependent interactions between the authorities and citizen and the sporadic contribution from charities and overseas organisations. Taiwan departed significantly from these two jurisdictions. The inception of Kuomintang’s authoritarian regime attempted to continue the regulatory-led institutional set-up from the colonial regime in the 1950 s. Whilst authority became abundant, financial resources were drained away to military project. International agents became the key actor to contribute to the functioning of public health governance. In the 1970 s to 1990 s, the fiscal crisis arising from exponential increase of public expenditure and the international policy discourse of deregulation led to the declining ability of tax-based direct provision of health care. There displayed a greater willingness to rely on more actors and more instruments to divest the responsibility of the government. However the negligence about the potential trade-off between authority and finance limited the dynamics of coordination between different actors. The sudden outbreak of the SARS episode in 2003 unveiled the problem of underinstitutionalisation of polity. It unsettled the role of power and authority of government as demonstrated in Singapore and unleashed the latent power of civil society in the arena of public health as seen in Hong Kong and Taiwan. It also illuminated the role of knowledge in dealing with uncertainty in an institutional set-up. published_or_final_versionUrban Planning and DesignDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|The German {{economy is}} on track, {{and will likely}} grow by 1. 8 percent this year; in the coming year, with a slight {{increase}} in dynamics, it will grow by 1. 9 percent. With these figures DIW Berlin confirms its forecast from this summer. Employment growth continues; the unemployment rate will decrease this year to 6. 4 percent, where it will remain in 2016. Due to the sharp drop in oil prices this year, inflation is low and stands at 0. 4 percent; next year it will climb to 1. 4 percent. Global economic growth is likely to experience a slight increase during the forecast period. In the industrialized countries in particular, the renewed drop in energy prices keeps inflation rates low. In addition, many countries have experienced steady improvements in labor markets. Together, these two factors support consumption and the purchasing power of households. Recovery in the euro area is moving forward. The euro's external value is low, the monetary policy is very expansionary, and major trading partners are growing vigorously; consumption is likely to develop well, {{and in the course of}} time, corporate investment is also expected to recover. In the emerging markets, growth will remain subdued this year. Higher financial market volatility is leading to deterioration in financing conditions. They are expected to contribute more to global growth next year, when for example Russia and Brazil have emerged from recession. German exports continue their upward trend: A strong upturn in major industrial countries, as well as the continued recovery within the euro area, are compensating for the somewhat weaker demand from the emerging countries. In net terms, however, foreign trade barely contributes to growth, because imports will increase significantly as part of the dynamic domestic economy. Consumption is supporting the growth of the German economy. The low inflation substantially supports consumers' purchasing power. But nominal incomes are also experiencing strong increases: The employment growth continues - the number of employed individuals is expected to rise at roughly the rate of previous quarters - and wages have noticeably increased, also due to the introduction of the minimum wage. Other important factors are the significant increases in social benefits; these are primarily due to a sharp increase in pensions, but also to the benefits being received by the refugees, which should give private consumption an additional boost. In contrast, investment will be rather subdued overall. Concerns about the future of the euro area are likely to dampen investment plans. Furthermore, considerable uncertainties about the development of important markets have recently intensified, particularly in China. There are also unresolved geopolitical conflicts, especially the tensions with Russia. Nevertheless, a moderate expansion of investment in equipment is emerging. With robust foreign demand and fully utilized capacities in the industry, these investments are expected to rise over time, especially since the dynamic domestic demand should provide an impetus. However, the risks to the economy remain high and in fact have recently increased. The impending interest rate turnaround in the U. S. could lead to unexpectedly strong capital outflows from the emerging countries; given the high private debt - especially since it is often in foreign currency - this could dampen economic momentum in these countries as well. Although a significant slump in the Chinese economy is expected to be handled with <b>expansionary</b> <b>measures</b> by the government, there is the risk that they may not take sufficient countermeasures in time. It has also been shown in the past that uncertainty about the further development of European integration can flare up quickly. In addition, the recently high volatility of oil prices shows that a new stable equilibrium still has not been established on the market. The planning uncertainty bound up with this could dampen the disposition of many corporations more strongly than assumed here...|$|R
40|$|This paper evaluates {{monetary}} policy-tradeoffs {{in low-income}} countries using a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model estimated on data for Mozambique {{taking into account}} the sources of major exogenous shocks, and level of financial development. To our knowledge this is a first attempt at estimating a DSGE model for Sub-Saharan Africa excluding South Africa. Our simulations suggests that a exchange rate peg is significantly less successful than inflation targeting at stabilizing the real economy due to higher interest rate volatility, as in the literature for industrial countries and emerging markets.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationships between}} selected internal governance mechanisms and CEO compensation, employing firm size as a moderator variable. Data is collected from a sample of 177 multi-sectoral firms listed on Bursa Malaysia. Measures of ownership, board structure, leadership, compensation, performance and size are operationalized. Sampled firms are grouped using revenue {{as a proxy for}} firm size. Independent groups t-tests and hierarchical regression analyses were performed for each group. The results were compared in order to validate the hypotheses. Comparison of results for sub-groups of firms support the moderating effect of firm size. In smaller firms, insider ownership, CEO tenure and board size exert significant positive effects on CEO compensation, while blockholder ownership exert significant negative effects. Among larger firms however, only firm size has a significant positive effect on CEO compensation. Our findings on small firms imply that while CEO compensation is a key perquisite that executives consume {{as a result of their}} control over the firm, this alone is insufficient to assure improved firm performance. In large firms, CEOs may embark of corporate <b>expansionary</b> strategies as <b>measure</b> to demand for higher compensation. The findings from the study contributes to understanding differences in the determinants of CEO compensation between small and large firms...|$|R
40|$|Japan’s {{experience}} {{shows that}} very negative circumstances {{are required for}} a country to suffer from protracted deflation. The comparison of Japan’s developments {{in the last few}} years with those of the US points to large differences, which suggest that the risk of deflation in the US is low. However, the analysis of the deflation spiral in Japan could be useful to draw lessons for other countries. The first lesson to draw is that deflation is very costly and that it is difficult to anticipate. Authorities should, thus, react aggressively to avoid zero interest rates, since reaching the zero bound drastically reduces the effectiveness of monetary policy. Before reaching the zero-bound, it seems useful to adopt an inflation targeting regime, perhaps accompanied by an explicit compromise of maintaining interest rates at very low levels for a predetermined period. When zero bound is reached, the authorities still have policy instruments to fight against deflation, among them heterodox monetary <b>measures,</b> <b>expansionary</b> fiscal policy and/or substantial exchange rate depreciation. The case of Japan points to the large potential costs of these options, in terms of the central bank’s balance sheet, the sustainability of the fiscal accounts and, potentially, the stability of the international monetary system. However, Japan’s protracted stagnation and deflation is bound to be more costly. Japón, EEUU, política monetaria, deflación...|$|R
