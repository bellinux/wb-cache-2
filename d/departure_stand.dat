50|$|Whereas the {{original}} bus station permitted two-way arrival and departure along Queensway, with some stands {{located on a}} refuge {{on the far side}} from the shopping centre, all the <b>departure</b> <b>stands</b> in the present one are located on the same side as the Cornbow Centre. It features electronic departure doors that are automatically activated by arriving buses, thus permitting full passenger segregation from manoeuvring vehicles.|$|R

60|$|On {{the morning}} of my <b>departure</b> I <b>stood</b> on the porch with old Peter waiting {{for the arrival of}} the mail driver, who was {{to take me to the}} nearest {{railroad}} town.|$|R
50|$|The {{interchange}} {{consists of}} 19 <b>departure</b> <b>stands,</b> numbered from 1 to 19, {{all of which}} employ a drive-in reverse-out layout.

60|$|For {{a moment}} after Alban's <b>departure,</b> the doctor <b>stood</b> irresolute. Arriving {{suddenly}} at a decision, he snatched up his hat, {{and turned to}} Emily in a hurry.|$|R
60|$|Mary {{took the}} other hand, and between them they placed {{her in an}} arm-chair, whose shining fresh white ground and gay rose-pattern contrasted with her heated, rumpled, over-watched appearance, as she sank her head on her hand, not noticing either Mary's {{presence}} or the Doctor's <b>departure.</b> Mary <b>stood</b> doubtful for a few seconds, full of pity and embarrassment, trying {{to take in the}} needs of the case.|$|R
60|$|So only a {{few minutes}} after Ennison's <b>departure,</b> while Anna <b>stood</b> indeed with her sister's open letter still in her hand, Courtlaw drove up in hot haste. She opened the door to him herself.|$|R
60|$|Mackay {{said nothing}} further, and shortly {{afterwards}} Lucille said she must take her <b>departure.</b> Sally <b>stood</b> smiling {{in the doorway}} while the riders of Bonaventure did her homage, and those whose compliments did not please her suffered for their clumsiness. When I rode out with Lucille Haldane there was a lifting of wide hats, and the sergeant, sitting upright in his saddle, saluted her as we passed with several splendid horsemen riding on each side.|$|R
60|$|Complete silence fell {{between us}} after her <b>departure.</b> The woods <b>stood</b> dark and {{motionless}} {{in the yellow}} evening light. There was no sound of wind or water, no sound of voices or footsteps; only far away the clear, scarce-audible warbling of a sleepy bird.|$|R
60|$|Josephine was herself again {{within a}} few moments of her husband's <b>departure.</b> She <b>stood</b> {{perfectly}} still for some time, as though listening to his departing footsteps. Then she crossed the room and pressed the bell twice. Once more she listened. The change in her expression was wonderful. She was expectant, eager, thrilled with the contemplation of some imminent happening. Her vigil came suddenly to an end, as the door was opened and closed again a little abruptly. It was no servant who had obeyed her summons; it was Wingate who entered, unannounced and alone.|$|R
50|$|In 2014 he {{resigned}} from the Republican Party, citing the party's policies on education, water and child welfare as reasons for his <b>departure.</b> He then <b>stood</b> for election in the 6th District as an Independent, losing by 3%. After leaving the Arizona State Legislature, O'Halleran hosted a radio show on KAZM in Sedona.|$|R
6000|$|... "Charles," [...] said he, {{the evening}} before his <b>departure,</b> as he <b>stood</b> close to the garden seat, on which his cousin was sitting, and amused himself with {{pitching}} stones into the river, which ran beneath the lawn at Clisson. [...] "Charles, I shall be off tomorrow; I almost envy you the broken arm which keeps you here." ...|$|R
6000|$|Again {{they were}} silent for some time; Feemy longed for Ussher to say {{something}} that might sound at any rate kind; {{he had never met}} her before without an affectionate word--and now, {{on the eve of his}} <b>departure,</b> he <b>stood</b> at the fire and merely answered her questions coldly and harshly. At length she felt that this must be the time, if ever, for saying to him what she had made up her mind to say on the previous evening, when her courage failed her. So, plucking up all the heart she could, and blushing at the time to the top of her forehead, she said, ...|$|R
25|$|The school Principal from 1997 to 2001 was Mark Anderson. On {{his arrival}} in 1997 {{enrolments}} had dropped from 1145 to 484 in the previous ten years. Anderson introduced a gifted and talented program to target the specialist needs of certain student interests to combat this {{and by the time}} of his <b>departure,</b> enrolments <b>stood</b> at over 600. In January 2002 Anderson took up the appointment of the founding Principal of the Sydney Secondary College, which had been created through the amalgamation of three inner-city high schools. Serving until 2004, Anderson became School Education Director for the Western Sydney Region in 2005 and is now Director of People and Careers for the NSW Department of Education since 2014.|$|R
60|$|On {{the evening}} before George's <b>departure,</b> Sylvia <b>stood</b> {{with him at the}} {{entrance}} to the Brantholme drive. He leaned upon the gate, a broad-shouldered, motionless figure; his eyes fixed moodily upon the prospect, because he was afraid to let them dwell upon his companion. In front, across the dim white road, a cornfield ran down to the river, and on one side of it a wood towered in a shadowy mass against a soft green streak of light. Near its foot the water gleamed palely among overhanging alders, and in the distance the hills faded into the grayness of the eastern sky. Except for the low murmur of the stream, it was very still; and the air was heavy with the smell of dew-damped soil.|$|R
60|$|At length {{the day of}} <b>departure</b> came. We <b>stood</b> on the {{platform}} at Paddington waiting for the Dartmouth train to start, for in those days the African mail sailed from that port. A minute or two before the train left, as we were preparing to enter our carriage I caught sight of a face that I seemed to recognise, the owner of which was evidently searching for someone in the crowd. It was that of Briggs, Sir Alexander's clerk, whom I had met in the sale-room.|$|R
50|$|The Regiment was {{accepted}} {{on the day}} succeeding the first Bull Run disaster, and Austin Light, of Chicago, was appointed Colonel; and under his direction the organization was completed, and left Camp Mather, Chicago, {{on the morning of}} October 13, 1861. The day previous to the <b>departure,</b> a beautiful <b>stand</b> of colors was presented to the Regiment by Miss Helen Arion, daughter of Colonel Arion. It had also won a handsome flag at a prize drill, {{under the auspices of the}} Illinois Agricultural Society, then in session at Chicago.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mabel is feeble in body, friend Cap; but {{in matters}} of this natur' I doubt if {{she may not be}} {{stronger}} than most men. But Sergeant Dunham is my friend, and he is your brother-in-law; so, now the press of fighting and maintaining our rights is over, it is fitting we should both go and witness his <b>departure.</b> I've <b>stood</b> by many a dying man, Master Cap," [...] continued Pathfinder, who had a besetting propensity to enlarge on his experience, stopping and holding his companion by a button,--"I've stood by many a dying man's side, and seen his last gasp, and heard his last breath; for, when the hurry and tumult of the battle is over, it is good to bethink us of the misfortunate, and it is remarkable to witness how differently human natur' feels at such solemn moments. Some go their way as stupid and ignorant as if God had never given them reason and an accountable state; while others quit us rejoicing, like men who leave heavy burthens behind them. I think that the mind sees clearly at such moments, my friend, and that past deeds stand thick before the recollection." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Ramsey: [...] "And {{they were}} really {{understood}} to be engaged?" [...] Miss Ramsey is a dark-eyed, dark-haired girl of nearly the length of two lady's umbrellas and the bulk of one closely folded in its sheath. She stands with her elbow supported {{on the corner of}} the mantel, her temple resting on the knuckle of a thin, nervous hand, in an effect of thoughtful absent-mindedness. Miss Garnett, more or less Merovingian in a costume that lends itself somewhat reluctantly to a low, thick figure, is apparently poising for <b>departure,</b> as she <b>stands</b> before the chair from which she has risen beside Miss Ramsey's tea-table and looks earnestly up into Miss Ramsey's absent face. Both are very young, but aim at being much older than they are, with occasional lapses into extreme girlhood.|$|R
500|$|It is {{time for}} farewells, with the Stark family having to split apart. Ned's two daughters journey with their father to the capital. Jon Snow {{journeys}} to join his uncle Benjen {{as a man of}} the Night's Watch at the Wall. Tyrion, who wants to see the [...] "edge of the world", accompanies them. Before leaving, Jon gives a sword to his sister Arya as a present. Lady Catelyn Stark is devastated by her husband's imminent <b>departure</b> and has <b>stood</b> vigil beside her son Bran since his fall. Having always deeply resented Jon, Catelyn asks him to leave when he comes to say goodbye to Bran and then chastises her husband Ned for leaving her and giving in to the demands of King Robert. Before they part, Jon asks Ned about his mother, and Ned promises to tell Jon about her the next time they meet. While stopping for a meal, Robert tells Ned that he has received word about Daenerys Targaryen's wedding to Khal Drogo and voices concern about the possibility of Viserys crossing the Narrow Sea with a Dothraki army to overthrow him with help from those in the Seven Kingdoms who still support the Targaryens' claim to the throne and think of Robert as a usurper.|$|R
