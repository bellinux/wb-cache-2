5|$|Octavian {{forcibly}} {{entered the}} temple of the Vestal Virgins and seized Antony's secret will, which he promptly publicized. The will would have <b>given</b> <b>away</b> Roman-conquered territories as kingdoms for his sons to rule, and designated Alexandria as the site for a tomb for him and his queen. In late 32BC, the Senate officially revoked Antony's powers as consul and declared war on Cleopatra's regime in Egypt.|$|E

It will be directed by John Lasseter, and {{will focus on the}} toys going to find Bo Peep, who was <b>given</b> <b>away</b> before the third film. Most of the cast of the previous will again reprise their character roles. However Mr. Potato Head will likely be recast for the film because of Don Rickles' death in 2017.|$|E
5|$|After the {{property}} was sold in 1960, the garden fell into disrepair, but with {{the purchase of the}} Barnett building, plans were made to restore it using historical photographs. The restoration to the original layout was completed in 2013. In its prime, the garden's centerpiece was a neoclassical bronze statue of Mercury by an unknown artist. The statue was <b>given</b> <b>away</b> in the 1960s, but it was donated back to the museum around 2013, to be displayed in the restored garden.|$|E

5|$|Bizet's {{marriage}} to Geneviève Halévy was intermittently happy and produced one son. After his death, his work, apart from Carmen, was generally neglected. Manuscripts were <b>given</b> <b>away</b> or lost, and published versions {{of his works}} were frequently revised and adapted by other hands. He founded no school and had no obvious disciples or successors. After years of neglect, his works began to be performed more frequently in the 20th century. Later commentators have acclaimed him as a composer of brilliance and originality whose premature death was a significant loss to French musical theatre.|$|E
5|$|Disruptive {{coloration}} {{is common}} in military usage, for military vehicles, for firing positions and other installations, and for individual soldiers, where uniforms, equipment such as helmets, and face paint {{may be used to}} break up outlines and features. Disruptive coloration, however, does not always achieve crypsis on its own, as an animal or a military target may be <b>given</b> <b>away</b> by other factors including shape, shine, and shadow.|$|E

5|$|On December 21, 2007, Kurt Jellinek responded on the Slackers website {{by stating}} that the article was sensationalist and misleading. Jellinek said that, of the 44 units the chain had, five were sold on eBay for $399.99, {{with a couple of}} units still in stock, and 35 were held for {{specific}} customers and sold at the MSRP. The remainder were <b>given</b> <b>away.</b> Some sites believe this may violate Nintendo's enforcement of the Wii's $249 retail price, and may prevent the store from receiving future products from Nintendo. Nintendo has refused to comment on the issue.|$|E
5|$|Sense and Sensibility was {{released}} on a two-disc DVD in the UK on 14 January 2008. All three episodes were <b>given</b> <b>away</b> free {{with a copy of}} the Daily Mail in 2009.

The two-disc set also included the BBC's Miss Austen Regrets, as well as commentary and interviews from the cast and crew.|$|E
5|$|The {{pipeline}} {{has also}} inspired {{various forms of}} artwork. The most notable form of art unique to the pipeline are pipeline maps—portions of scrap pipe cut {{into the shape of}} Alaska with a piece of metal delineating the path of the pipeline through the map. Pipeline maps were frequently created by welders working on the pipeline, and the maps were frequently sold to tourists or <b>given</b> <b>away</b> as gifts. Other pipeline-inspired pieces of art include objects containing crude oil that has been transported through the pipeline.|$|E

5|$|A sequel, titled Toy Story 4, will be {{released}} on June 21, 2019. The film was originally to be directed by John Lasseter and co-directed by Josh Cooley. In July 2017, however, {{it was announced that}} Cooley would be the movie's sole director. The film will focus on Bonnie's toys helping Woody to reunite with Bo Peep, who was <b>given</b> <b>away</b> before the events of this film. Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Kristen Schaal and Laurie Metcalf will reprise their roles of Woody, Buzz, Trixie and Mrs. Davis. The rest of this film's cast may also return. Don Rickles also signed on to return to voice Mr. Potato Head; however, Rickles died during production. It is uncertain how his death will affect Potato Head's role in the fourth film.|$|E
5|$|Casinos, {{and vendors}} serving, selling or storing {{alcoholic}} beverages for a casino, {{are required to}} obtain a casino hotel alcoholic beverage (CHAB) license from the Division of Gaming Enforcement. CHAB licenses must be renewed every five years. New Jersey's casino alcohol regulations are divided into five different regions of activity: (a) the casino floor (includes simulcasting facilities); (b) the hotel (includes restaurants and meeting rooms); (c) package goods; (d) room service; and (e) storage. Alcohol sold or <b>given</b> <b>away</b> on the casino floor and in hotel areas must be in an open container for immediate consumption, whereas alcohol sold in a package goods area must be sealed. Alcoholic beverages brought to a patron as a room service may be open or closed, whereas storage areas must not be accessible to the public.|$|E
5|$|Disruptive {{patterns}} use strongly contrasting, non-repeating markings such as spots or stripes {{to break}} up the outlines of an animal or military vehicle, or to conceal telltale features, especially the eyes, as in the common frog. Disruptive patterns may use more than one method to defeat visual systems such as edge detection. Predators like the leopard use disruptive camouflage to help them approach prey, while potential prey like the Egyptian nightjar use it to avoid detection by predators. Disruptive patterning is common in military usage, both for uniforms and for military vehicles. Disruptive patterning, however, does not always achieve crypsis on its own, as an animal or a military target may be <b>given</b> <b>away</b> by factors like shape, shine, and shadow.|$|E
50|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the 2015 release of the album Home, Garrels <b>gave</b> <b>away</b> free copies of his {{previous}} albums on Noisetrade.com.

The <b>giving</b> <b>away</b> of the album did not seem to hurt the success of the album; in fact some have suggested that the marketing strategy led to even greater success.|$|R

5|$|Henry II {{wanted to}} secure the {{southern}} borders of Aquitaine and decided to betroth his youngest son to Alais, the daughter and heiress of Humbert III of Savoy. As part of this agreement John was promised the future inheritance of Savoy, Piedmont, Maurienne, and the other possessions of Count Humbert. For his part in the potential marriage alliance, Henry II transferred the castles of Chinon, Loudun and Mirebeau into John's name; as John was only five years old his father would continue to control them for practical purposes. Henry the Young King was unimpressed by this; although {{he had yet to}} be granted control of any castles in his new kingdom, these were effectively his future property and had been <b>given</b> <b>away</b> without consultation. Alais made the trip over the Alps and joined Henry II's court, but she died before marrying John, which left the prince once again without an inheritance.|$|E

Thirty were autographed by Miyamoto himself {{at the opening of the}} Nintendo World Store in New York.|$|E
5|$|Mills {{has been}} accused by several {{newspapers}} of having embellished her life story. A journalist with the same name, Heather Mills, at that time at The Observer, accused Mills of impersonating her {{for over a year}} in the late 1990s, showing people cuttings of articles the journalist had written, which helped Mills secure a job presenting The General, a BBC TV programme about Southampton General Hospital. There were also doubts about Mills's claim that she had been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, because the Heather Mills Health Trust had <b>given</b> <b>away</b> thousands of prosthetic limbs to landmine victims, but the nomination cannot yet be proven because the identities of all nominees remain secret for 50 years.|$|E
