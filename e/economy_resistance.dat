40|$|Abstract: While liberalizing {{key factor}} markets {{is a crucial}} step in the {{transition}} from a socialist control-economy to a market <b>economy,</b> <b>resistance</b> from entrenched interests and concerns about risk and rising inequality can stall the process. The paper studies how market and non-market forces interacted to influence agricultural land allocation in the wake of Vietnam’s reforms aiming to establish a free market in land-use rights following de-collectivization. Our econometric tests using a farm-household panel data set spanning the reforms suggest that land allocation responded efficiently, but that the response was tempered by the local political economy, which operated to assure greater equity than would have been possible otherwise...|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} put forward to explain the rise of angiosperms to ecological dominance following the Cretaceous. A unified scheme incorporating all these theories {{appears to be an}} inextricable knot of relationships, processes and plant traits. Here, we revisit these hypotheses, categorising them within frameworks based on plant carbon <b>economy,</b> <b>resistance</b> to climatic stresses, nutrient economy, biotic interactions and diversification. We maintain that the enigma remains unresolved partly because our current state of knowledge {{is a result of the}} fragmentary nature of palaeodata. This lack of palaeodata limits our ability to draw firm conclusions. Nonetheless, based on consistent results, some inferences may be drawn. Our results indicate that a complex multidriver hypothesis may be more suitable than any single-driver theory. We contend that plant carbon economy and diversification may have played an important role during the early stages of gymnosperms replacement by angiosperms in fertile tropical sites. Plant tolerance to climatic stresses, plant nutrition, biotic interactions and diversification may have played a role in later stages of angiosperm expansion within temperate and harsh environments. The angiosperm knot remains partly tied, but to unravel it entirely will only be feasible if new discoveries are made by scientific communities...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{compare the}} European Community's "trade fundamentals" {{prevailing}} in the 1960 s with those applying in Arab countries today. The fundamentals differ significantly-Arab countries trade much less {{with each other}} than EC members did, {{and the importance of}} such trade in GDP varies greatly. This suggests that a viable Arab integration strategy must follow a path that differs from the preferential trade liberalization-led approach implemented by the European Community. An alternative is to complement long-standing attempts to liberalize merchandise trade with an effort that revolves around service sector reforms and liberalization. This may prove to be an effective mechanism to support reforms as, in principle, there is a major constituency in each Arab country that has an interest in improving the performance of services-the natural resource-based and manufacturing sectors. A key condition for such an approach to be feasible is that Arab cooperation helps overcome political <b>economy</b> <b>resistance</b> to national, unilateral action, or, generates direct gains from cooperation in specific policy areas.

40|$|Some {{economic}} conditions in Iran such as presence of stagflation, inappropriateness of business environment, foreign investment decrease, and technological and technical knowledge disconnection of domestic product prepare a ground for activities in <b>resistance</b> <b>economy</b> field. <b>Resistance</b> <b>economy</b> prepares {{the grounds for}} the comprehensive growth and development even in the economic pressures and sanctions. Relying on the <b>resistance</b> <b>economy,</b> dependency on foreign countries should be reduced and increasing the self-reliance {{and the use of}} domestic products should be emphasized. Undoubtedly, stock market positively affects on manufacturing domestic products and reduces the market liquidity, since growth in manufacturing domestic products will reduce the country’s dependence on some foreign goods and play pivot role in forming the proper consumption pattern in the <b>resistance</b> <b>economy.</b> Therefore, more companies will be established, product and national income will be increased and unemployment will be reduced. Currently, these effects are not obvious in the economy of the country, because the structure of Iran’s financial system is seemingly bank-based not market-based. This descriptive-correlational study aims to investigate the impact of increase in stock market turnover on the disappearance of Iran’s market-oriented economy which results in the formation of <b>resistance</b> <b>economy.</b> To this end, the statistics obtained of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2006 and 2009 were used as statistical sample. The results revealed that the increase in Iran’s stock market turnover emphasized on the vital role of private sector in expanding country’s economy opportunities and prepared the grounds for achievement of <b>resistance</b> <b>economy</b> through increasing domestic product...|$|R

40|$|Antibiotic {{resistance}} {{is a growing}} threat to human health and {{is defined by the}} World Health Organization as a crisis that must be managed with the utmost urgency. Antibiotic resistant bacteria increase both mortality and morbidity and have a great impact on the global <b>economy.</b> <b>Resistance</b> is not confined to human health care, but is present also among animals and in our environment at large. Indeed, resistant bacterial strains have now been found in virtually all parts of the world, even in locations without direct human contact. The human gastrointestinal tract is populated by a complex, dynamic, diverse and highly interactive collection of microorganisms, including bacteria, archaea, fungi, yeasts and viruses, which constitutes our gastrointestinal microbiota. This microbiota is an important reservoir of resistance genes (our gastrointestinal resistome) and a “melting pot” for transfer of resistance genes between microbes, including potential pathogens. In this thesis I investigated the prevalences of two clinically important kinds of antibiotic resistance: extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), as well as asymptomatic carriage of potential enteropathogens among healthy preschool children in Uppsala. Fecal samples from unidentified, individual diapers were collected in 2010 (125 + 313 samples) and in 2016 (334 samples). In addition, 204 environmental samples from the children’s preschools were collected in autumn 2016. A prevalence of 2. 9 % ESBL-producing Enterobactericeae was demonstrated in the first samples from 2010. No VRE were found and the occurrence of enteropathogens were reassuringly low. Results on ESBL prevalence in 2016 and transmission of resistance between children will be presented when the manuscript is published and at the dissertation...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{reassess}} the cyclical {{performance of the}} French economy in the 1920 s, focusing in particular on the period 1926 - 1931 and on France's resistance to the Great Depression. France expanded rapidly after 1926 and, unlike the other leading industrial economies, resisted {{the onset of the}} Depression until 1931. We find strikingly little support for the conventional explanation for these events, which emphasizes an undervalued French franc and an export-led boom. While French exports as a share of GDP turned down as early as 1928, the economy continued to expand for several subsequent years. Investment, not exports, emerges as the proximate source of the French <b>economy's</b> <b>resistance</b> to the Great Depression. And fiscal policy emerges as the major determinant of the surge in French investment spending. Previous accounts have emphasized the role of monetary policy in determining the seal and nominal exchange rates ostensibly responsible for French economic fluctuations in the decade after 1921. In contrast, we argue here for a more balanced view of the roles of monetary and fiscal policies in French macroeconomic fluctuations over that critical decade. ...|$|R
