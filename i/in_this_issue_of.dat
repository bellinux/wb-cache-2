2500|$|All the Masses are freely {{composed}} plainsong paraphrases - which fulfills {{the requirement}} of the eradication of secular influences. It {{is interesting to note}} that Animuccia’s presentation of an ‘intelligible’ style is only evident in the Gloria and the Credo, [...] and even here he seems reluctant to strip all ‘artifice’ from the music. Instead he alternates homophonic phrases with polyphonic phrases. In his book of Masses Animuccia is consciously trying to compose music that reconciles, as he sees it, the two polarities <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> composing ‘intelligible’ music: that of making the text audible, yet at the same time sounding beautiful – therefore fulfilling the music’s most important function of drawing the listener deeper into prayer and closer to God. Other significant stylistic features of Animuccia’s composition style include variations in vocal textures and color by varying voice groupings, and instances of word painting.|$|E
2500|$|Polish Americans {{found that}} they were not {{protected}} by the United States courts system in defending their own civil rights. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 Title VII states: [...] "No person in the United States shall on the grounds of race, color, or national origins, be excluded from participation in, or denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination." [...] In Budinsky v. Corning Glass Works, an employee of Slavic origin was fired after 14 years for speaking up about name-calling and anti-Slavic discrimination by his supervisors. The judge ruled that the statute did not extend beyond [...] "race" [...] and the employment discrimination suit was dismissed because he was therefore not part of a protected class. In the District of Columbia, Kurylas v. U.S. Department of Agriculture, a Polish American bringing suit over equal opportunity employment was told by the court that his case was invalid, as [...] "only nonwhites have standing to bring an action". Poles were also snubbed by the destruction of their Poletown East, Detroit, community in 1981, when eminent domain by corporations triumphed against them in court and displaced their historic town. Aloysius Mazewski of the Polish American Congress felt that Poles were overlooked by the eminent domain and corporate personhood changes to U.S. law, arguing for a change in laws so that [...] "groups as well as individuals" [...] could launch anti-defamation lawsuits and confront civil rights charges. Senator Barbara Mikulski supported such a measure, although no movement has been successful <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> amending law for ethnic groups not recognized as racial minorities.|$|E

6000|$|Could I go {{and make}} it up with him, and then borrow? I weighed the chances of that. Then I thought of selling or pawning something, but that seemed difficult. My winter {{overcoat}} had not cost a pound when it was new, my watch was not likely to fetch many shillings. Still, both these things might be factors. I thought with a certain repugnance of the little store my mother was probably making for the rent. She was very secretive about that, and it was locked in an old tea-caddy in her bedroom. I {{knew it would be}} almost impossible to get any of that money from her willingly, and though I told myself that <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> passion and death no detail mattered, I could not get rid of tormenting scruples whenever I thought of that tea-caddy. Was there no other course? Perhaps after every other source had been tapped I might supplement with a few shillings frankly begged from her. [...] "These others," [...] I said to myself, thinking without passion for once of the sons of the Secure, [...] "would find it difficult to run their romances on a pawnshop basis.

50|$|Milch {{has pointed}} out {{repeatedly}} in interviews that {{the intent of the}} show was to study the way that civilization comes together from chaos by organizing itself around symbols (in Deadwood the main symbol is gold). Initially, he intended to study this within Roman civilization (the central symbol was to be the religious cross), but HBO's Rome series was already in production and Milch was asked by the network if he could stage the story in another place. Although the series touches on a variety of issues including race, prostitution, misogyny, violence, politics and immigration, most of the major story lines are grounded <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> bringing order from chaos.|$|E

Also enclosed was a 2-sided flexi disk, side one produced by Peter Walker, a musical associate of Timothy Leary, and side two titled [...] "Loop", credited to the Velvet Underground but actually recorded by Cale alone. [...] "Loop", a recording solely of pulsating audio feedback culminating in a locked groove, was [...] "a precursor to Reed's Metal Machine Music", say Velvets archivists M.C.

50|$|Zatanna is the {{daughter}} of magician Giovanni Zatara who appeared in Golden Age comic books and Sindella, a member of the mystical Homo magi race. Her younger cousin, the teenager Zachary Zatara, is also a magician in the DCU. Zatanna makes her living as a stage illusionist prior to discovering her magical abilities while investigating the disappearance of her father. Her original costume is based upon her father's costume but substituting fishnet stockings and high heels for slacks. Zatanna's search for her father {{was the subject of a}} storyline which was featured in several titles edited by Julius Schwartz, and in it, Zatanna interacts with Hawkman and Hawkgirl; battles Batman and Robin while in disguise as a witch and under the control of the villain the Outsider; and teams with the Atom, Green Lantern, and the Elongated Man. The series culminated in Justice League of America #51 (Feb. 1967). This Justice League adventure took place during the Batman television craze where Batman was featured prominently on the cover. The premise that the witch in Detective Comics #336 was Zatanna was perceived as an attempt to get Batman participating <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> Justice League of America no matter how vague the connection to Zatanna's quest was.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{employment}} of Swahili Rap represents an attempt to negotiate the authentic gangster projection with more traditional and local Tanzanian musical forms. Between the prominent mainstream US hip hop image of gangster rappers and increased radio and television airplay for groups from South Africa, Europe and the Congo region who project that image, Tanzanian rappers are heavily swayed toward a more raw style. While this borrowing of the authentic gangster image as represented outside of Tanzania {{can be interpreted as}} an appropriation for localizing purposes, it can also be viewed as mimicry. Since authentic gangster rap is commercially viable, Tanzanian artists are torn between the possibilities it presents and the negative attention it may gain them. Indeed, those who do imitate Western gangster rap are often isolated and derided for being gangster wannabes. Thus, the use of the Swahili language in Tanzanian rap helps take ideas from a larger hip hop discourse and incorporate them into the local context of that African rap culture. It makes sense then that those most dependent on the more marketable hardcore rap generally come from the impoverished regions of Tanzania, like Dar Es Salaam, where any chance at success may be more important than the worry of abandoning national pride in exuding a culturally ambivalent image. One of the paramount rap topics <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> balance is the objectification of women, which while it may be more marketable than less explicit forms, stands in contention with the Islamic ideals that many Tanzanians embrace. Still though, crude styles tend to appeal to the urban youth of Tanzania, as exemplified by the rap group LWP Majitu who, according to Out Here Records, [...] "are popular for their hardcore hard hitting lyrics." [...] Whether in the poorer parts of Tanzania or the more privileged, it is crucial for rap artists to maintain a healthy balance between the traditional and the original, the local and the global.|$|E
