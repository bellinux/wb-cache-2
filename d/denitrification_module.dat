40|$|ATLAS is a {{new global}} Lagrangian Chemistry and Transport Model (CTM), which {{includes}} a stratospheric chemistry scheme with 46 active species, 171 reactions, heterogeneous chemistry on polar stratospheric clouds and a Lagrangian <b>denitrification</b> <b>module.</b> Lagrangian (trajectory-based) models have several important advantages over conventional Eulerian models, including the absence of spurious numerical diffusion, efficient code parallelization and no limitation of the largest time step by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy criterion. This work describes and validates the stratospheric chemistry scheme of the model. Stratospheric chemistry is simulated with ATLAS for the Arctic winter 1999 / 2000, {{with a focus on}} polar ozone depletion and denitrification. The simulations are used to validate the chemistry module in comparison with measurements of the SOLVE/THESEO 2000 campaign. A Lagrangian <b>denitrification</b> <b>module,</b> which is based on the simulation of the nucleation, sedimentation and growth {{of a large number of}} polar stratospheric cloud particles, is used to model the substantial denitrification that occured in this winter...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the importance of heterotrophic denitrification in the fate of nitrogen surpluses at the catchment scale. For that purpose we modified the <b>denitrification</b> <b>module</b> of TNT 2 model and calibrated the model on a small catchment where denitrification measurements had been performed in different locations. The main interest of the TNT 2 model {{is its ability to}} simulate the dynamics of the zones where soil and shallow water table interact, making it possible to spatialize the denitrification process. Daily water and nitrogen flux at the outlet were relatively well simulated (Nash of 0. 85 and 0. 77). In average, the model correctly simulates the denitrification measurements (R = 0. 68). Nitrogen flux towards the atmosphere, at the catchment scale (4. 70 g N m(- 2) year(- 1)), is of the same order of magnitude as the soluble N flux in the stream. The model was able to reproduce the distribution of denitrification in the riparian (mean of 9. 26 g N m(- 2) year(- 1)) and hillslope (mean of 3. 45 g N m(- 2) year(- 1)) domains of the catchment. The results confirm the importance of riparian denitrification, but show also that hillslope soils contribute significantly (60 %) to the whole catchment denitrification. The variations of denitrification rates, and also of nitrate concentrations in stream were not very well simulated by the model, highlighting the complexity of the spatial and temporal controls of nitrogen dynamics in areas with high inputs of nitrogen fertilizers, especially under organic forms.

40|$|Abstract An {{improved}} {{version of}} an ecosystem nitrogen cycling model (NLOSS) is described, tested, and used to analyze nitrogen cycling in the Yaqui Valley, Sonora, Mexico. In addition to previously described modules in NLOSS that simulate soil water and solute fluxes, soil evapo-ration, soil energy balance, and <b>denitrification,</b> <b>modules</b> were added to estimate crop growth, soil carbon cycling, urea hydrolysis, and nitrification. We first tested the model against season-long measurements of soil NO...|$|R
