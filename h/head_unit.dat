Relatively unchanged in 2004, a facelift for 2005 brought minor revisions to the exterior – mainly revised styling to the front fascia due to complaints of rubbing the ground on the previous incarnation and replacing the red lenses on the taillamps with clear ones. Also, the center instrument panel was slightly redesigned and featured a Toyota <b>head</b> <b>unit</b> in place of the previous GM-sourced radio.|$|E
25|$|The Prevé has {{received}} generally favourable reviews from critics in its domestic market. Malaysian automotive journalist Danny Tan from paultan.org commended the Prevé's looks, practicality, ergonomics and NVH attributes. The ride comfort and handling characteristics were exceptionally praised, in which Danny claimed was “unrivaled in the Asian C-segment sedan class”. However, the CamPro IAFM+ variants of the Prevé {{were not as}} well received {{in comparison with the}} turbocharged CamPro CFE model. The lack of power and torque from the IAFM+ engine was held responsible for poor acceleration and overall performance, but nonetheless competent in normal driving conditions. Danny also criticized some design flaws on the interior, such as the poorly designed <b>head</b> <b>unit</b> and instrument panel.|$|E

25|$|The Prevé {{made its}} debut in Australia on 18 October 2012 at the 2012 Australian International Motor Show.

500|$|MY11: {{revisions}} to the styling identify this update, marketed by Holden as the [...] "Series II". Announced on 31 August 2010, and launched on 10 September, MY11 heralded styling changes across the range by way of new front fascias, the addition of aerodynamic lip detailing to the decklids of sedans, and new alloy wheel designs on the Berlina specification and higher. Front-end changes comprise partially reshaped headlamps, redesigned bumpers, and an enlarged grille with restyled inserts that differ throughout the model range. Inside, the interiors receive a redesigned centre console stack incorporating a new 6.5-inch touchscreen, new dashboard, rearranged controls, reconfigured ventilation outlets, and updates to trimmings and illumination colours. SV6, SS and SS V interiors are differentiated via the application of circular air vents. Standard on all models is the 6.5-inch infotainment system developed primarily by Siemens VDO. Dubbed [...] "Holden-iQ", this integrates media playback and control functions. The iQ <b>head</b> <b>unit</b> replaces the previous mechanical CD stacker with a single slot and built in storage for approximately 15 CDs worth of music (internal storage optional on the Omega). The system also features full iPod integration, USB and auxiliary input, and incorporates Bluetooth handsfree telephone compatibility and music streaming. On V-Series specifications, iQ incorporates satellite navigation with live traffic updates, speed zone alerts and traffic camera notification. Sedans and wagons specified with navigation also receive a reversing camera.In terms of powertrain, the MY11 brought flex-fuel capability for the 3.0-litre V6 and 6.0-litre V8, allowing them to run on E85 bio-ethanol (see above). With the MY11 update, Holden also introduced a new [...] "Redline" [...] sports package as an option on V-Series models. The package includes lightweight, forged and polished 19-inch multi-spoke alloy wheels from the Pontiac G8 GXP. Other Redline additions encompass four-piston Brembo high-performance brakes, stiffer [...] "FE3" [...] suspension and chromed window surrounds for sedans, and the fitment of the tyre inflater kit on the Redline Ute.|$|E

However, the GTI – available only in 3 or 5 door hatchback body styles in three colours being red, silver and black. Its power plant was a 1.6 litre16V [...] engine with variable valve timing. External changes included a deeper front splitter with honeycomb mesh grilles, lowered sports suspension (10mm), a subtle rear spoiler, deeper side skirts, fog lights, and 15" [...] BBS RXII split rims for the wheels bearing 195/45/15 tyres. There were also standard extras such as Climatronic fully automatic air conditioning, xenon headlights with a headlight washer system, a six-disc CD autochanger with a GAMMA <b>head</b> <b>unit,</b> exclusive sports interior with leather steering wheel, handbrake and gearstick, chrome inserts, and driver aids such as ABS with EBD and an EDL (a system to aid traction).

2500|$|At {{the heart}} of a Sirius {{receiver}} is a custom application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip called the Baseband Integrated Circuit currently the STA240, which is produced by STMicroelectronics. The chip contains embedded ARM7TDMI and ARM946E-S microprocessors synthesized from IP cores. Every baseband has a unique Electronic Serial Number (or Sirius ID). Another major section of a Sirius receiver is the tuner. The tuner is also a custom ASIC, the STA210. The tuner connects to the antenna, and receives the incoming satellite and terrestrial signals at 2.315GHz and downconverts them to intermediate frequency signals at around 75MHz. The strength of the signals is approximately −50dBm in clear-sky conditions. The IF signals are fed to the STA240, which are digitized, demodulated, error-corrected, de-interleaved, and decrypted using specialized circuits on the chip. The baseband processor utilizes a 16 MB SDRAM memory to buffer four seconds of one of the satellite signals in order to bring it into time coincidence with the other for Maximal-ratio combining. On newer receivers with a [...] "pause" [...] feature, a dual-port PSRAM is employed to store up to 60 minutes of the selected channel. The baseband processor outputs digital audio over a Serial Peripheral Interface, which is fed to a D/A converter to produce the analog audio signal. The front-end of a Sirius receiver is called the <b>head</b> <b>unit,</b> required to display descriptive text (such as the category, channel, artist, and song name) and provide controls to the user. This is implemented by the third-party designers of Sirius-ready receivers, using a microprocessor of their choice.|$|E
