500|$|Wollstonecraft {{left for}} Paris in December 1792 and arrived {{about a month}} before Louis XVI was guillotined. Britain and France were {{on the brink of}} war when she left for Paris, and many advised her not to go. France was in turmoil. She sought out other British {{visitors}} such as Helen Maria Williams and joined the circle of expatriates then in the city. On 26 December 1792, Wollstonecraft saw the former king, Louis XVI, being taken to be tried before the National Assembly, and much to her own surprise, found the sight of Louis riding down the streets as a prisoner in a wagon [...] "made the tears flow insensibly <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> when I saw Louis sitting, with more dignity than I expected from his character, in a hackney coach going to meet death, where so many of his race have triumphed". During her time in Paris, Wollstonecraft associated mostly with the moderate Girondins rather than the more radical Jacobins.|$|E
2500|$|The second period, 1649–56, was {{in exile}} {{at the court}} of his brother-in-law, Alexander III of Imereti, when Teimuraz, in his own words, used poetry as therapy: [...] "Tears flowed mercilessly like the Nile <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b> To {{overcome}} I wrote from time to time, I threw my heart into it." [...] In his poems, Teimuraz laments the destruction of his kingdom, condemning the [...] "transient and perfidious world", and mourns the fate {{of his family and}} friends, cursing the cause of his own and his people’s misfortunes, the [...] "bloodthirsty king of Persia." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the time, {{the central}} region of Vietnam {{where the family}} lived was still under the {{sovereignty}} of Emperor Tự Đức, but {{the southern part of}} the country had gradually been colonised in the 1860s and turned into the colony of Cochinchina. In 1874, an attack on Hanoi forced Tự Đức to sign a treaty to open up the Red River for French trade. In Nam Đàn District, a Binh Tây (Pacify the French) movement sprung among the local scholar-gentry, and Phan responded at the age of seven by playing Binh Tây with his classmates, using “guns” made of bamboo tubes and lychee bullets. The unrest was enough to prompt the imperial court to bring in troops to quell the opposition to Huế's deal with the French. Phan's family was not affected by the crackdown, but the movement had a deep impact on him. Later in life, he noted that as a youth, “I was endowed with a fiery spirit. From the days when I was a small child … every time I read the stories of those in the past who were ready to die for the righteous cause, tears would come running <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> soaking the books.” ...|$|E
