40|$|The {{study of}} students’ {{motivation}} and {{attitude towards the}} usage of second language (L 2) has recently become an important concept across the disciplines of second language acquisition and communication. This paper highlights {{the result of the}} survey questionnaire adopted from Gardner’s (2009) <b>attitude</b> motivation <b>test</b> <b>battery</b> that was administered among 288 Arabic students from six universities in Nigeria. Principal component analysis was carried out to determine the validity of the items in the Nigerian context. 23 out of the 50 items with factor loading < 0. 40 loaded on four factors with eigenvalue < 1. 0. Descriptive statistics, Pearson product moment correlation and multiple regression analyses were used to explore the students’ attitude and motivation towards the learning of Arabic language. The four constructs of the questionnaire are: Integrativeness, attitudes toward the learning situation, motivation and instrumentality. The result showed that students have high level of both integrativeness and attitude towards the state of arts of learning, while their level of motivation and instrumentality is very low. In addition to that, there is positive and moderate correlation between integrativenness and attitude towards the state of arts of learning, while the correlation between attitude and motivation is very low. The same thing is applicable to integrativeness and motivation. Instrumentality, however, fails to correlate with any of the factors. The multiple regression analysis showed that attitude toward the state of arts of learning is a good predictor of the students’ integrativeness. In the fi nal analysis, some pedagogical recommendations were put forth in the paper to improve the students’ motivation and positive attitude towards the learning of Arabic language in the Nigerian universities...|$|R

In the present study, we aimed to ex-plore the <b>general</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward genetic <b>testing</b> in a sample representative of the German general popula-tion (n 5 2, 076) and to compare the attitudes of persons at risk for hereditary non-polyposis colorectal can-cer/familial adenomatous polyposis (HNPCC/FAP) (n 5 36) who had attended a university genetic counseling service, with a matched general population sample. We administered a subset of a questionnaire previously used in a Finnish study (Jallinoja et al., 1998). The 12 statements pertain to approval, disapproval, and con-cern for genetic testing. Overall, the results reveal high approval of genetic testing in the German population and in at-risk persons. In accordance with other studies, {{we find that the}} attitudes of individuals for whom hereditary disease is a salient issue of personal relevance and the <b>attitudes</b> of the <b>general</b> public are very sim-ilar. Only a few significant differences between these two samples emerged, indicating that at-risk persons hold a more favourable view of the testing. One intriguing finding was the high rate of “don’t know ” re-sponses, especially in the general population sample. Compared to results from Finland, approval of genetic testing is lower in the German population, and endorsement of “don’t knows ” is remarkably higher.

40|$|A pilot {{interview}} study {{looked at}} reasons why {{women did not}} attend a clinic following an invitation for a cervical smear test offered via a computer-managed scheme. Three broad issues were identified. First, the inaccuracy of the computer database (the FPC register) meant some women were inaccessible because they no longer lived at the address recorded. Other women were ineligible or unsuitable within the criteria of the scheme but had been sent invitations inappropriately because their screening records were incomplete or out of date. Second, aspects of service organisation and provision led to misclassification of some attenders as non-attenders and to various failures of communication such as non-receipt of the invitation or health education leaflet or unsuccessful attempts to rearrange appointments. In addition, the appointment or venue offered could be unsatisfactory. The third issue concerned {{the characteristics of the}} women which sometimes interacted with practical problems connected with service provision. Other women believed the test to be inappropriate for themselves while some were deterred by the prospect of the test itself. In general, embarrassment was pervasive and reflected in preferences for different types of service provision.

The current use of <b>test</b> <b>batteries,</b> while necessary and well accepted, is at risk of failing as the size of these batteries increases. To counter the statistical, fatigue, and clinical efficiency problems of large <b>test</b> <b>batteries,</b> we propose a hierarchical approach to APD assessment. This begins with an overall test of listening difficulty in which performance is measurably affected for anyone with an impaired ability to understand speech in difficult listening conditions.

There is currently a lack of consensus as to which of the many available assessment tools for knee function that should be included. The present aim was to use a statistical approach to investigate the contribution of frequently used tests to avoid redundancy, and filter them down to a proposed comprehensive and yet feasible <b>test</b> <b>battery</b> for long-term evaluation after ACL injury. In total 48 outcome variables related to knee function, all potentially relevant for a long-term follow-up, were included from a cross-sectional study where 70 ACL-injured (17 - 28 years post injury) individuals were compared to 33 controls. Cluster analysis and logistic regression were used to group variables and identify an optimal <b>test</b> <b>battery,</b> from which a summarized estimator of knee function representing various functional aspects was derived. As expected, several variables were strongly correlated, and the variables also fell into logical clusters with higher within-correlation (max ρ = 0. 61) than between clusters (max ρ = 0. 19). An extracted <b>test</b> <b>battery</b> with just four variables assessing one-leg balance, isokinetic knee extension strength and hop performance (one-leg hop, side hop) were mathematically combined to an estimator of knee function, which acceptably classified ACL-injured individuals and controls.

Several studies have shown that students lack motivation to learn any language but English. Of particular concern is the young males’ underachieving and disinterest in foreign languages.   In the meantime, a number of international studies and the statistical data from Swedish national agencies of secondary and higher education (Skolverket and Högskoleverket) have indicated that Russian is one of the languages that are favoured by males. The primary goal of my case study was, therefore, to examine students’ motivation to learn Russian and their attitudes towards language, community and Russian-speaking people. Another objective was to investigate gender differences in motivational factors. The study was conducted at the Department of modern languages of Uppsala University and the empirical data was collected using a mixed methodology. The questionnaire for the students was based on Gardner’s <b>Attitude</b> / Motivation <b>test</b> <b>battery</b> (AMTB), adapted for the goals and objectives of my research. To place the students’ responses in a wider context, semi-structured interviews with teachers of Russian were conducted. The analysis revealed a high level of both integrative and instrumental motivation for students of both genders as well as intrinsic motivation towards learning Russian. It is seen as a challenging subject to master but this is not perceived as an obstacle; rather, a stimulating factor (especially for males). The results indicate that although male students think of themselves as less motivated than females, the gender differences, in general, were not significant.   Both male and female participants are integrative-orientated.

Background Seventy-seven patients diagnosed with advanced PD were recruited in an open longitudinal 36 -month study at 10 clinics in Sweden and Norway; 40 of them were treated with levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) and 37 patients were candidates for switching from oral PD treatment to LCIG. They utilized a mobile device <b>test</b> <b>battery,</b> consisting of self-assessments of symptoms and objective measures of motor function through a set of fine motor tests (tapping and spiral drawings), in their homes. Both the LCIG-naïve and LCIG-non-naïve patients used the <b>test</b> <b>battery</b> four times per day during week-long test periods. Methods Assessments The LCIG-naïve patients used the <b>test</b> <b>battery</b> at baseline (before LCIG), month 0 (first visit; at least 3 months after intraduodenal LCIG), and thereafter quarterly for the first year and biannually for the second and third years. The LCIG-non-naïve patients used the <b>test</b> <b>battery</b> from the first visit, i. e. month 0. Out of the 77 patients, only 65 utilized the test battery; 35 were LCIG-non-naïve and 30 LCIG-naïve. In 20 of the LCIG-naïve patients, assessments with the <b>test</b> <b>battery</b> were available during oral treatment and at least one test period after having started infusion treatment. Three LCIG-naïve patients did not use the <b>test</b> <b>battery</b> at baseline but had at least one test period of assessments thereafter. Hence, n= 23 in the LCIG-naïve group. In total, symptom assessments in the full sample (including both patient groups) were collected during 379 test periods and 10079 test occasions. For 369 of these test periods, clinical assessments including UPDRS and PDQ- 39 were performed in afternoons {{at the start of the}} test periods. The repeated measurements of the <b>test</b> <b>battery</b> were processed and summarized into scores representing patients’ symptom severities over a test period, using statistical methods. Six conceptual dimensions were defined; four subjectively-reported: ‘walking’, ‘satisfied’, ‘dyskinesia’, and ‘off’ and two objectively-measured: ‘tapping’ and ‘spiral’. In addition, an ‘overall test score’ (OTS) was defined to represent the global health condition of the patient during a test period. Statistical methods Change in the <b>test</b> <b>battery</b> scores over time, that is at baseline and follow-up test periods, was assessed with linear mixed-effects models with patient ID as a random effect and test period as a fixed effect of interest. The within-patient variability of OTS was assessed using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), for the two patient groups. Correlations between clinical rating scores and <b>test</b> <b>battery</b> scores were assessed using Spearman’s rank correlations (rho). Results In LCIG-naïve patients, mean OTS compared to baseline was significantly improved from the first test period on LCIG treatment until month 24. However, there were no significant changes in mean OTS scores of LCIG-non-naïve patients, except for worse mean OTS at month 36 (p< 0. 01, n= 16). The mean scores of all subjectively-reported dimensions improved significantly throughout the course of the study, except ‘walking’ at month 36 (p= 0. 41, n= 4). However, there were no significant differences in mean scores of objectively-measured dimensions between baseline and other test periods, except improved ‘tapping’ at month 6 and month 36, and ‘spiral’ at month 3 (p< 0. 05). The LCIG-naïve patients had a higher within-subject variability in their OTS scores (ICC= 0. 67) compared to LCIG-non-naïve patients (ICC= 0. 71). The OTS correlated adequately with total UPDRS (rho= 0. 59) and total PDQ- 39 (rho= 0. 59). Conclusions In this 3 -year follow-up study of advanced PD patients treated with LCIG we found that it is possible to monitor PD progression over time using a home environment <b>test</b> <b>battery.</b> The significant improvements in the mean OTS scores indicate that the <b>test</b> <b>battery</b> is able to measure functional improvement with LCIG sustained over at least 24 months...|$|R

Among the available serum <b>test</b> <b>batteries</b> is a group of exams commonly referred to as liver function tests. Many clinician...|$|R
40|$|The ARES 1 (ANAM 2 Readiness Evaluation System) is a {{cognitive}} testing system designed for operation on palm OS handheld computers i. e., Personal Digital Assistants (PDA). It provides an inexpensive and portable testing platform for field and clinical applications. ARES <b>test</b> <b>batteries</b> can be configured from {{a library of}} tests derived from the ANAM test system. ARES features include support of multiple users on a single PDA, a Microsoft WindowsTM <b>test</b> <b>battery</b> authoring program, and a program for downloading, viewing, graphing, and archiving data. In validity tests, the same subjects were tested on identical ARES and conventional ANAM NeuroCog <b>test</b> <b>batteries.</b> Scores from the two platforms correlated highly, but absolute scores differed slightly. In reliability testing with the ARES Warrior battery, ARES scores were highly correlated in daily tests...|$|R

40|$|Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a {{relatively}} common psychiatric disorder affecting 5 - 10 % of child and 4 % of the adult population. The disorder involves both behavioural problems and cognitive deficits, which {{are believed to be}} associated with neurological differences seen in this population. There has been increasing interest in understanding the cognitive deficits and neurological basis associated with ADHD. Neuropsychological examinations are an affordable tool, which can be used to improve our understanding of the cognitive deficits associated with the disorder and aid in clinical care. Currently, there is no standardized neuropsychological assessment {{that can be used in}} this population. In order to assist in developing a sound, predominately computerized <b>test</b> <b>battery,</b> which would assess deficits commonly seen in adults with ADHD, a neuropsychological project was piloted to examine recruitment and test utility. The majority of the tests were computerized and had population norms. The <b>test</b> <b>battery</b> was piloted on 8 patients on and off medication, and 4 patients completed the <b>test</b> <b>battery</b> twice off medication to examine potential practice effects. A discussion of feasibility and utility of the neuropsychological <b>test</b> <b>battery</b> for adults with ADHD ensues...|$|R

Day by day the nature of the game changes its structure. The purpose of this study was to construct a skill <b>test</b> <b>battery</b> in Hockey. To achieve this purpose initially thirteen skill tests were designed by the investigators. A pilot study was conducted with thirty subjects, after analyzing the various factors, seven test items were finalised by keen observation and consultation with the experts. The seven skill test items were administered to ninety six college level Hockey players from affiliated colleges of Alagappa University, Karaikudi, Tamil Nadu, whose age ranged from 18 to 25 years. To find out the validity simple correlation was employed. Further stepwise multiple regressions were used for validating the <b>test</b> <b>battery</b> and to arrive the final <b>test</b> <b>battery.</b> The selected seven skill test items have shown sufficient reliability, objectivity and validity but only the following three test items namely Straight Hit, Flick and Speed dodge were part of the final <b>test</b> <b>battery...</b>|$|R
