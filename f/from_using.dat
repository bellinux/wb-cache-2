5|$|Another $500,000 {{study was}} ordered in 2003 by the legislature, {{creating}} a new commerce corridor to link Lewis County {{in the south to}} the Canada–US border in the north. However the study showed that a highway existing north of I-90 was not economically feasible. The study proposed a toll road only for trucks, since the presence of passenger cars would discourage truck drivers <b>from</b> <b>using</b> the new alternate route. The highway was estimated to cost between $13.5 and $19 billion.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} {{remedy for}} farmers of pollinated crops {{is simply to}} switch <b>from</b> <b>using</b> beekeepers {{to the use of}} native bees, such as bumble bees and mason bees.

5|$|At 1:00 pm on December 10, General Matsui {{ordered all}} units {{to launch a}} {{full-scale}} attack on Nanking.

Clambering up the ridges of the mountain, {{the men of the}} SEA had to painstakingly wrest control of each Chinese encampment one by one in bloody infantry charges. Advancing along the south side of Zijinshan was no easier as General Matsui had forbidden his men <b>from</b> <b>using</b> artillery there due to his deep conviction that no damage should come to its two famous historical sites, Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum.|$|E

Instead, he decided to rebuild his war chest to unseat Kentucky's incumbent Republican senator, Richard P. Ernst, in 1926.
