As, information producers in the process to not to lose the readership of their content, and to cater the information requirements of both the <b>electronic</b> and the <b>print</b> <b>readers,</b> reproduce almost {{the whole of the}} printed information in digital form as well. Abundant literature is also equally produced in electronic format only, thereon, sharing this information on hundreds of social networking sites, like, Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, Flicker, Digg, LinkedIn, etc. without attributions to original authors, have created almost a mess of this whole information produced and disseminated. Accordingly, the study discusses about the sources of information pollution, the aspects of unstructured information along with plagiarism. Towards the end of the paper stress has been laid on information literacy, as how it can prove handy in addressing the issue with some measures, which can help in regulating the behaviour of information producers...|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} study we {{investigated}} word, pseudoword and story reading in Dutch speaking braille and <b>print</b> <b>readers.</b> To examine developmental patterns, these reading skills were assessed in both children and adults. The results reveal that braille readers read less accurately and fast than <b>print</b> <b>readers.</b> While item length has no impact on word reading accuracy and speed {{in the group of}} <b>print</b> <b>readers,</b> it has a significant impact on reading accuracy and speed in the group of braille readers, particularly in the younger sample. This suggests that braille readers rely more strongly on an enduring sequential reading strategy. Comparison of the different reading tasks suggests that the advantage in accuracy and speed of reading in adult as compared to young braille readers is achieved through semantic top-down processing. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{relations}} between reading, auditory, speech, phonological and tactile spatial processing are investigated in a Dutch speaking sample of blind braille readers {{as compared to}} sighted <b>print</b> <b>readers.</b> Performance is assessed in blind and sighted children and adults. Regarding phonological ability, braille readers perform equally well compared to <b>print</b> <b>readers</b> on phonological awareness, better on verbal short-term memory and significantly worse on lexical retrieval. The groups do not differ on speech perception or auditory processing. Braille readers, however, have more sensitive fingers than <b>print</b> <b>readers.</b> Investigation of the {{relations between}} these cognitive and perceptual skills and reading performance indicates that {{in the group of}} braille readers auditory temporal processing has a longer lasting and stronger impact not only on phonological abilities, which have to satisfy the high processing demands of the strictly serial language input, but also directly on the reading ability itself. <b>Print</b> <b>readers</b> switch between grapho-phonological and lexical reading modes depending on the familiarity of the items. Furthermore, the auditory temporal processing and speech perception, which were substantially interrelated with phonological processing, had no direct associations with print reading measures. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the influence of}} print exposure on the body-object interaction (BOI) effect in visual word recognition. High <b>print</b> exposure <b>readers</b> and low <b>print</b> exposure <b>readers</b> either made semantic categorizations (“Is the word easily imageable?”; Experiment 1) or phonological lexical decisions (“Does the item sound like a real English word?”; Experiment 2). The results from Experiment 1 showed {{that there was a}} larger BOI effect for the low <b>print</b> exposure <b>readers</b> than for the high <b>print</b> exposure <b>readers</b> in semantic categorization, though an effect was observed for both print exposure groups. However, the results from Experiment 2 showed that the BOI effect was observed only for the high <b>print</b> exposure <b>readers</b> in phonological lexical decision. The {{results of the present study}} suggest that print exposure does influence the BOI effect, and that this influence varies as a function of task demands...|$|R

40|$|The {{possible}} {{existence of}} Braille dyslexia has been proposed. We {{have investigated the}} relations between phonological, speech and auditory processing as well as tactile sensitivity measures {{in the group of}} Estonian braille readers. The results showed that braille <b>readers</b> outperformed <b>print</b> <b>readers</b> on the finger sensitivity task, being able to detect the direction of 0, 59 mm smaller gaps. Additionally, braille readers were able to identify nearly 10 % more words correctly than <b>print</b> <b>readers</b> in a most difficult listening condition on a speech perception task. Since the sample size is rather small, no ground breaking conclusions can be drawn. However, based on the results {{it can be said that}} Braille and print reading do largely rely on similar cognitive processes. status: publishe...|$|R

The contact area was consistently underestimated by the <b>electronic</b> <b>prints</b> and resulted in {{a significant change in}} the arch index. The long plantar angle was poorly correlated between techniques.

40|$|There is a {{proportion}} of blind individuals who experience serious Braille reading difficulties, which cannot be easily explained. In the sighted population, developmental dyslexia is the term that {{is used in the}} case of the failure to acquire age appropriate reading skills, despite adequate intelligence and instruction. We have investigated the reading performance in a group of the Estonian braille and <b>print</b> <b>readers.</b> Mixed model analysis revealed that in the braille group there’s no significant difference in the way how item length (1, 2 or 3 - 4 syllable items) influences reading accuracy and speed between words and pseudo-words, indicating that similar strategy is used for reading both (phonological route). In the group of <b>print</b> <b>readers,</b> however, there’s a significant difference in the way how item length influences accuracy and speed of word and pseudoword reading, indicating that different strategies might be used (visual route for words and phonological route for pseudo-words). status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Similar to many sighted {{children}} who struggle with learning to read, {{a proportion of}} blind children have specific difficulties related to reading braille which cannot be easily explained. A lot of {{research has been conducted}} to investigate the perceptual and cognitive processes behind (impairments in) print reading. Very few studies, however, have aimed for a deeper insight into the relevant perceptual and cognitive processes involved in braille reading. In the present study we investigate the relations between reading achievement and auditory, speech, phonological and tactile processing in a population of Estonian braille reading children and youngsters and matched sighted <b>print</b> <b>readers.</b> Findings revealed that the sequential nature of braille imposes constant decoding and effective recruitment of phonological skills throughout the reading process. Sighted <b>print</b> <b>readers,</b> on the other hand, seem to switch between the use of phonological and lexical processing modes depending on the familiarity, length and structure of the word. status: publishe...|$|R
