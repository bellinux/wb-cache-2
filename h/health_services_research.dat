40|$|Objective: In mental <b>health</b> <b>service</b> <b>research,</b> the {{investigated}} <b>services</b> {{and care}} systems {{as well as}} the research methodology should be described in a precise and transparent fashion so that findings can be clearly interpreted and used. Therefore, this study investigates what is reported in German language publications on mental <b>health</b> <b>service</b> <b>research.</b> Method: All original papers on mental <b>health</b> <b>service</b> <b>research,</b> that were published in the Psychiatrische Praxis between 1999 and 2002, were systematically reviewed and, using a structured classification system, subjected to content analysis. In particular, it was assessed what forms of care had been studied and what characteristics of care were reported. Results: 54 % (199) of all original publications reported mental <b>health</b> <b>service</b> <b>research</b> in a wide sense. Of these, 8 % were qualitative studies. 58 % of studies investigated in-patient treatment, 20 % comprehensive care systems, and 4 % services provided by psychiatrists or psychotherapists in private office practice. There were hardly any studies on innovative service models. In 51 % of studies, authors had conducted investigations within their own service or care system. In most articles characteristics of the patient sample were exactly described, whilst precise information on the <b>researched</b> <b>service</b> - such as funding, staffing and organisation - was usually missing. Discussion: There - still - is relatively little <b>research</b> on outpatient <b>services,</b> and mental <b>health</b> <b>service</b> <b>research</b> is not yet appropriately based in the community. Requirements for exact and comprehensive descriptions of the researched services' and care systems are rarely met. In general, the findings suggest that mental <b>health</b> <b>service</b> <b>research</b> in German speaking countries might benefit from studies with researchers who are independent from the investigated service, the evaluation of innovative service models, and - above all - a standardised description of the services and context in research studies...|$|R

30|$|Additionally, it {{has been}} {{documented}} that there are no published articles on the effectiveness of the IRB structure, and no evidence on process or outcomes related to IRB structure and research [8]. In fact, recent analyses found various IRB boards often asked for different and competing revisions when presented with the exact same studies. It has also been noted that some IRB decisions are not in line with federal policies and IRB approval wait times delay research. These same analyses found no evidence to support current or varying IRB structure [9]. The opportunity to require ongoing and definitive national research and data collection on IRBs should be immediately seized. Specifically, <b>health</b> <b>service</b> <b>research</b> should be completed on IRB structure, research approvals, and the outcomes, impact and effectiveness of these decisions. Evidence for IRB structure, or lack thereof, should be prioritized by <b>health</b> <b>service</b> <b>research</b> agencies and academia.
