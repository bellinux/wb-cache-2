The situation reveals that the <b>distribution</b> <b>losses</b> of the CEB are {{higher than that of}} developed countries. Detailed energy audit should be carried out to identify the areas where the loss level is high. The study will help to localize the area suffering from high energy losses. Thus the measurement should be carried by installing energy meters for the said areas. This thesis presents a study about the electrical losses in low voltage distribution system of CEB. The nature of the <b>distribution</b> <b>losses</b> in low voltage power distribution system, their sources, measurement of technical and non-technical losses and their impact on the system are presented. The steps that can be taken to have an assessment of the <b>distribution</b> <b>losses</b> and steps to be taken to reduce technical losses and corrective actions to plug non-technical losses by proper administrative actions are detailed. A methodology to segregate <b>distribution</b> <b>losses</b> is also presented. Variation of low voltage <b>distribution</b> <b>losses</b> and voltage drop with consumer density per km were calculated.
