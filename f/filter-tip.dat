50|$|R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company {{launched}} the first menthol <b>filter-tip</b> cigarettes in 1956 under the Salem brand. Less heavily mentholated than Kools, Salems were positioned as an all-purpose cigarette, and captured 0.8% market share within their first year. Other tobacco producers, seeing {{the success of}} Salem, soon introduced their own mentholated filter cigarettes: Lorillard with Newport in 1957 and Spring in 1959; Philip Morris with Alpine in 1959; and Brown & Williamson with Belair in 1960.|$|E
50|$|In April 2012, Lambert & Butler Fresh Burst and Lambert & Butler Profile {{were added}} to the range. Lambert and Butler Fresh Burst {{cigarettes}} contain a capsule within the <b>filter-tip,</b> which when squeezed, pops and mentholates the cigarette. Lambert and Butler Profile Cigarettes are thinner in diameter, targeted at the busy smoker, who desires a cigarette which provides the same nicotine level as a standard size cigarette but in a smaller package, making the cigarette quicker to smoke. Fresh Burst and Profile are available in price marked or standard 20 packs.|$|E

40|$|By {{the late}} 1970 s, eight {{technologies}} {{in the design}} of a ‘less hazardous’ cigarette were classified as significant. The eight included: The tobacco blend, the filter tip, <b>filter-tip</b> additives, reconstituted tobacco sheet, paper additives, air dilution via paper porosity, expanded tobacco, and air dilution via <b>filter-tip</b> perforation. In addition to these eight cigarette-design technologies was another proposed technology which involved the incorporation of a substitute for {{some or all of the}} tobacco in the cigarette filler. Despite considerable research and development (R&D) effort on various tobacco substitutes that indicated the replacements in most instances fulfilled the definition of a ‘less hazardous’ cigarette with regard to the chemical and biological properties of their mainstream smoke, tobacco substitute-containing cigarettes failed to attain consumer acceptability. As a result, several marketed products containing tobacco substitutes had an extremely brief tenure in the marketplace. Outlined herein is a summary of some detailed research conducted on the composition of the mainstream smokes from cigarettes containing either all-substitute filler or fillers comprising various substitute and tobacco mixtures as well as an all-tobacco cigarette...|$|E
40|$|This article uses daily data {{on stock}} returns of five U. S. {{publicly}} traded cigarette producers {{to document the}} wealth effects of antismoking policies initiated in the period 1964 to 1971. The authors find significant abnormal returns across 23 dates corresponding to important regulatory events. The second-stage estimation shows that wealth effects are also influenced by firm characteristics, such as market share, advertising intensity, percentage of sales of <b>filter-tip</b> cigarettes, percentage of advertising expenditures devoted to TV and radio, and tobacco leaf inventories. Overall, the article estimates that industry losses from antismoking policies amounted to approximately $ 1. 5 billion.

40|$|SUMMARY. -There was no {{statistically}} significant difference in specific mouse skin carcinogenicity between smoke condensate from plain, flue-cured tobacco cigarettes with a normal tar to nicotine ratio and condensate from <b>filter-tip</b> cigarettes made from selected flue-cured tobaccos with a reduced tar to nicotine ratio. NUMEROUS mouse skin painting experiments with tobacco smoke condensate have repeatedly demonstrated a relationship between weight of condensate applied and the tumour response (Wynder et al., 1953; Day, 1967). This observation is consistent with conclusions reached from human epidemiological evidence that the risk of developing lung cancer increases with the duration of smoking and the number of cigarettes smoked per day (Best, Josie and Walker, 1960; Doll and Hill, 1954, 1956). If this risk is associated wholly with the particulate phase of smoke, although at present {{there is no evidence to}} support this belief, then reduction in the tar and nicotine yields of cigarettes would be desirable and can be achieved by the use of an efficient filter. Such reductions would only b...|$|E
40|$|Objective: In a {{prospective}} cohort study among 120, 852 adult subjects the authors investigated the associations between cigarette, cigar, pipe, environmental tobacco smoking (ETS), and bladder cancer. Methods: In 1986 all subjects completed a questionnaire on cancer risk factors. Follow-up for incident bladder cancer {{was established by}} linkage to cancer registries until 1992. The case-cohort analysis was based on 619 cases and 3346 subcohort members. Results: Compared with lifelong non-smokers the age- and sex-adjusted incidence rate ratios (RR) for ex- and current cigarette smokers were 2. 1 (95 % CI 1. 5 - 3. 0) and 3. 3 (95 % CI 2. 4 - 4. 6), respectively. The RR for smoking duration was 1. 03 (95 % CI: 1. 02 - 1. 04) per 1 -year increment. The RR per 10 cigarettes/day was 1. 3 (95 % CI 1. 2 - 1. 4). Tar and nicotine exposure increased bladder cancer risk only weakly. It appeared that associations of cigarette smoking characteristics with bladder cancer risk were largely attributable to cigarette smoking duration only. Smoking cessation, age at first exposure, <b>filter-tip</b> usage, cigar and pipe smoking, and ETS were no longer associated with bladder cancer risk after adjustment for frequency and duration of smoking. Conclusions: The authors conclude that current cigarette smokers have a three-fold higher bladder cancer risk than non-smokers. Ex-smokers experience a two-fold increased risk. About half of male bladder cancer and one-fifth of female bladder cancer was attributable to cigarette smoking. Other smoking types (cigar, pipe, or ETS) were not associated with increased risks.

40|$|This thesis reports an {{investigation}} into the causes of higher female-than-male rates of lung cancer among 25 - 44 year olds in Tasmania, Australia, during 1983 - 92. A rationale for the study is provided in Chapter 1. In particular, the focus on measures of tobacco smoking as the principal study factor is justified, and decisions made in relation to other putative study factors are explained. Australian lung cancer mortality rates are examined in Chapter 2. Those of 20 - 44 year old women ceased rising in 1986, before overtaking male rates, despite higher proportions of smokers and lower mean age of commencement of smoking in subsequent cohorts of women born after the 1940 s. To investigate this, lung cancer incidence in Australia during 1982 - 95 is analysed in Chapter 3. The birth cohort trends in incidence of squamous cell carcinoma and small cell lung carcinoma are consistent with a reduction in risk following the introduction of <b>filter-tip</b> cigarettes. Lung cancer rates of young women are also relatively high in New Zealand. The hypothesis tested in Chapter 4 is that this is an outcome of cool climate living. With the exception of the higher-than-predicted rates of young Tasmanian women, the regional variation in lung cancer incidence of 20 - 44 year olds in Australia and New Zealand was well explained by differences in smoking prevalence. A case-control study was undertaken to explain the high lung cancer rates of young Tasmanian women. Chapter 5 reports on reliability studies that established that agreement was high and random error was low for measurements of lifetime exposure to cigarette smoking. In a study of gender differences in smoking exposures in the source population, Chapter 6 reports that the female controls had lower exposures to tobacco smoking than the male controls. The differences were most pronounced for subjects born in the early 1940 s, who constitute the bulk of the age-matched controls. The results of the case-control analysis of tobacco smoking exposures are presented in Chapter 6. In contrast to the previous excess of female cases, when the members of the cohort were younger, 62...|$|E
