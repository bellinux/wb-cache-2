5|$|The IX Corps {{headquarters}} {{was first}} constituted on 29 July 1921 in the organized reserves, a new corps formation intended to compliment the existing corps commands {{in the active}} duty component of the force by providing command to reserve units. It was assigned a shoulder sleeve insignia shortly thereafter. Though the corps was not activated, it remained on the organizational rolls of the Army, to be called on when needed.

We provide {{a detailed description of the}} rostering problem faced and present an integer programming model that has been used in practice for creating <b>duty</b> <b>rosters</b> at the department for more than a year. Using real world data, we compare the model output to a manually generated roster as used previously by the department and analyze the quality of the rosters generated by the model over a longer time span. Moreover, we demonstrate how unforeseen events such as absences of scheduled physicians are handled...|$|R

500|$|In the Russian Imperial Palace, while Tsar Paul I sleeps, a dalliance {{between two}} courtiers {{ends with a}} shriek which wakens the tsar. Enraged, he demands that his {{officials}} produce the culprit or face banishment for life. Meanwhile, a clerk's {{slip of the pen}} while compiling a military <b>duty</b> <b>roster</b> results in the inclusion in the list of a fictitious officer, [...] "Lieutenant Kijé". When the tsar inspects the list he is intrigued by this name, and asks that the officer be presented to him. The court officials are too terrified of the tsar to admit that a mistake has been made, and are in a dilemma until it occurs to them to blame [...] "Kijé" [...] for the nocturnal disturbance. They inform the tsar, who duly orders the imaginary lieutenant flogged and sent to Siberia.|$|E

50|$|When the Saratoga Museum Foundation took {{possession}} of the submarine, it was described as K-81 in the initial press releases from the Saratoga Museum Foundation. The Foundation spent months refurbishing the interior, which included removing several bulkheads, moving large pieces of equipment, and going deep into the bilges. During this process, documents were found which provided incontrovertible proof that the submarine was the K-77 and not the K-81 as earlier thought. The records confirming this information include maintenance reports, equipment exchanges, radio messages, <b>duty</b> <b>rosters,</b> log entries, and torpedo firing exercises, which all identify the submarine as K-77.|$|R

25|$|As {{a further}} measure to prevent escapes, the patrol {{patterns}} of the Grenztruppen were carefully arranged to reduce any chance of a border guard defecting. Patrols, watchtowers and observation posts were always manned by two or three soldiers at a time. They {{were not allowed to}} go out of each other's sight in any circumstances. When changing the guard in watchtowers, they were under orders to enter and exit the buildings {{in such a way that}} there were never fewer than two people on the ground. <b>Duty</b> <b>rosters</b> were organised to prevent friends and roommates being assigned to the same patrols. The pairings were switched (though not randomly) to ensure that the same people did not repeatedly carry out duty together. Individual border guards did not know until the start of their shift with whom they would be working that day. If a guard attempted to escape, his colleagues were under instructions to shoot him without hesitation or prior warning.|$|R
