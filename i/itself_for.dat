The production faced opposition from a variety of special interest groups and city authorities, who were concerned about the potential for damage to historical sites around the city, and problems with graffiti and rubbish appearing in the film.|$|E
5|$|Folklorist John A. Gutowski {{sees in the}} Douglas jackalope {{an example}} of an American tall tale publicized by a local {{community}} that seeks wider recognition. Through a combination of hoax and media activity, the town or other community draws attention to <b>itself</b> <b>for</b> social or economic reasons.

5|$|Former McKinsey senior executives, Rajat Gupta and Anil Kumar, {{were among}} those convicted in a {{government}} investigation into insider trading for sharing inside information with Galleon Group hedge fund owner Raj Rajaratnam.

The division launched a reconnaissance in force on the Voëvre Plain, but before it could begin a full assault, the Allies signed an Armistice ending hostilities. After 33 days on the front lines, the 7th Division suffered 1,988 casualties. It was awarded one campaign streamer for Lorraine. The brigade performed occupation duties for the next year as it began preparations to return to the continental United States.|$|E
5|$|In {{models of}} the {{expanding}} universe, the farther galaxies are from each other, the faster they drift apart. This receding is not due to motion through space, but rather {{to the expansion of}} space <b>itself.</b> <b>For</b> example, galaxies far away from Earth appear to be moving away from the Earth with a speed proportional to their distances. Beyond a boundary called the Hubble sphere, the rate at which their distance from Earth increases becomes greater than the speed of light.|$|E

For example, in the performance of nō, the ma of sound and silence does not have an organic relation for the purpose of artistic expression. Rather, these two elements contrast sharply with one another in an immaterial balance.|$|E
5|$|The Alamanni {{seized the}} {{opportunity}} to launch a major invasion of Gaul and northern Italy. However, the Visigoths were defeated in battle that summer near the modern Italian-Slovenian border and then routed in the Battle of Naissus that September by Gallienus, Claudius and Aurelian, who then turned and defeated the Alemanni at the Battle of Lake Benacus. Claudius' successor Aurelian defeated the Goths twice more in the Battle of Fanum Fortunae and the Battle of Ticinum. The Goths remained a major threat to the Empire but directed their attacks away from Italy <b>itself</b> <b>for</b> several years after their defeat. By 284 AD, Gothic troops were serving on behalf of the Roman military as federated troops.|$|E
5|$|The {{bog turtle}} spends its life almost {{exclusively}} in the wetland where it hatched. In its natural environment, it has a maximum lifespan of perhaps 50 years or more, and the average lifespan is 20–30 years. The Bronx Zoo houses several turtles 35years old or more, the oldest known bog turtles. The zoo's collection has successfully sustained <b>itself</b> <b>for</b> more than 35years.

He was drafted into the army in early 1944; both MGM and his radio sponsor tried to obtain a deferment for the comedian, but to no avail. His last Raleigh radio show was on June 6, 1944, {{the day before he}} was formally inducted as a private; he was not assigned to Special Services at that time. Without its star, the program was discontinued, and the opportunity presented <b>itself</b> <b>for</b> the Nelsons to begin a radio show of their own, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet.|$|E
5|$|This {{period of}} calm {{came to an}} end when the British consul in Rio de Janeiro nearly sparked a war between Great Britain and Brazil. He sent an {{ultimatum}} containing abusive demands arising out of two minor incidents at the end of 1861 and beginning of 1862. The Brazilian government refused to yield, and the consul issued orders for British warships to capture Brazilian merchant vessels as indemnity. Brazil prepared <b>itself</b> <b>for</b> the imminent conflict, and coastal defenses were given permission to fire upon any British warship that tried to capture Brazilian merchant ships. The Brazilian government then severed diplomatic ties with Britain in June 1863.|$|E
