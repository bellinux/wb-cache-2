500|$|Arctic Monkeys {{wasted no}} time in {{recording}} new material, and released a five-track EP on 24 April 2006, titled Who the <b>Fuck</b> <b>Are</b> Arctic Monkeys?. Due to its length, the EP was ineligible to chart as a UK single or album. Furthermore, the record's graphic language has resulted in significantly less radio airplay than previous records, although this was not a reported concern according to an insider – [...] "since they made their name on the Internet... they don't care if they don't get radio play". The release of the EP Who the <b>Fuck</b> <b>Are</b> Arctic Monkeys? just three months after their record-breaking debut album has been criticised by some, who have seen it as [...] "money-grabbing" [...] and [...] "cashing in on their success". The band countered that it regularly releases new music not to make money, but to avoid the [...] "boredom" [...] of [...] "spending three years touring on one album".|$|E
500|$|Mark Lindsay of the US band Paul Revere & the Raiders {{recalled}} {{buying the}} single and first {{listening to it}} {{at home with his}} producer at the time, Terry Melcher. According to Lindsay: [...] "When the song ended we both just looked at each other. I said, Now what the <b>fuck</b> <b>are</b> we gonna do?' With that single, the Beatles raised the ante as to what a pop record should be." [...] Lindsay ensured that the clips for both sides of the single were broadcast on the Raiders' television show, Where the Action Is.|$|E

500|$|Eminem, born Marshall Bruce Mathers III, began rapping at age fourteen. In 1996, {{his debut}} album Infinite, which was {{recorded}} at the Bassmint, {{a recording studio}} owned by the Bass Brothers, was released under their independent record label Web Entertainment. [...] Infinite achieved very little commercial success and was largely ignored by Detroit radio stations. [...] The disappointment from this experience greatly influenced his lyrical style: [...] "After that record, every rhyme I wrote got angrier and angrier. A {{lot of it was}} because of the feedback I got. Motherfuckers was like, 'You're a white boy, what the <b>fuck</b> <b>are</b> you rapping for? Why don't you go into rock & roll?' All that type of shit started pissing me off." [...] After the release of Infinite, Eminem's personal struggles and abuse of drugs and alcohol culminated in an unsuccessful suicide attempt.|$|E
500|$|The PTC {{started off}} 2005 with their {{campaign}} against the Without a Trace episode [...] "Our Sons and Daughters", leading to CBS being fined for indecency in March 2006; the PTC objected to the depiction of teenagers participating in an orgy in that episode. CBS argued that the episode [...] "featured an important and socially relevant storyline warning parents to exercise greater supervision of their teenagers." [...] The FCC fined CBS $3.63 million in March 2006 for this episode, but after a court settlement, the network agreed to pay $300,000 in fines. [...] At the end of January 2005, the FCC rejected a set of complaints that PTC filed between October 2001 and February 2004 for allegedly indecent programs such as NBC's Friends, the WB's Gilmore Girls, and Fox's The Simpsons. The FCC received complaints from the PTC in the summer over an unedited broadcast of the lyric [...] "who the <b>fuck</b> <b>are</b> you?" [...] in The Who's song [...] "Who Are You" [...] from the Live 8 concert broadcast July 2, 2005 on ABC stations on the East Coast.|$|E
500|$|Musician and ambient music pioneer Brian Eno has {{praised the}} album and said, {{regarding}} the song [...] "Soon", that [...] "t {{set a new}} standard for pop. It's the vaguest music ever {{to have been a}} hit." [...] Robert Smith of The Cure discovered Loveless after a period of almost exclusively listening to [...] "disco, or Irish bands like the Dubliners" [...] as a means of avoiding his contemporaries, and said, [...] " [...] was the first band I heard who quite clearly pissed all over us, and their album Loveless is certainly one of my all-time three favourite records. It's the sound of someone [...] who is so driven that they're demented. And the fact that they spent so much time and money on it is so excellent." [...] Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins told Spin, [...] "It's rare in guitar-based music that somebody does something new [...] At the time, everybody was like, 'How the <b>fuck</b> <b>are</b> they doing this?' And, of course, it's way simpler than anybody would imagine." [...] Trey Anastasio of jam band Phish believed that [...] "Loveless [...] the best album recorded in the '90s", and wanted his band to cover the album in its entirety for a Halloween show. Robert Pollard of indie rock band Guided by Voices acknowledged the album as a source of inspiration, noting, [...] "Sometimes when I want to write lyrics, I'll listen to Loveless. Because of the way the vocals are buried, you can almost listen to the songs as if they're instrumental pieces." [...] Loveless has also been said by Jim DeRogatis to have been a considerable influence on British band Radiohead.|$|E

500|$|Reactions to the {{transmissions}} were mixed, {{triggering a}} media debate concerning the ethical implications of mixing rock entertainment with human tragedy. The Edge said, [...] "A lot of nights {{it felt like}} quite an abrupt interruption that was probably not particularly welcomed {{by a lot of}} people in the audience. You were grabbed out of a rock concert and given a really strong dose of reality and it was quite hard sometimes to get back to something as frivolous as a show having watched five or ten minutes of real human suffering." [...] Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment. In 2002, he said, [...] "I can't remember anything more excruciating than those Sarajevo link-ups. It was like throwing a bucket of cold water over everybody. You could see your audience going, 'What the <b>fuck</b> <b>are</b> these guys doing?' But I'm proud to have been a part of a group who were trying to do something." [...] During a transmission for the band's concert at Wembley Stadium, three women in Sarajevo told Bono via satellite, [...] "We know you're not going to do anything for us. You're going to go back to a rock show. You're going to forget that we even exist. And we're all going to die." [...] Some people close to the band joined the War Child charity project, including Brian Eno. Writer Bill Flanagan believes that the link-ups accomplished Bono's goal for Zoo TV of [...] "illustrating onstage the obscenity of idly flipping from a war on CNN to rock videos on MTV". U2 vowed to perform in Sarajevo someday, eventually fulfilling this commitment on their 1997 PopMart Tour.|$|E
2500|$|According {{to a study}} {{involving}} the use of [...] "sexual keywords" [...] among twenty female participants by researcher Michael L. Tan, sexual terms in Tagalog have widely different connotations: some words, such as kuntut or hindut, are undeniably profane in all contexts, while others, such as euphemistic use of the verbs gamit (to use), mag-ano (to do [...] "you know what") or mangyari (to happen), are more socially acceptable. Some words for intercourse are English derived: mag-do (to [...] "do it"), mag-sex (to have sex) and the plain verb <b>fuck</b> <b>are</b> reportedly common among upper class Filipinos.|$|E

[...] Regarding the reputation of his character, he said: [...] "When I came home, I was walking on the streets of Manhattan, and people were just screaming, [...] "Check out the big brain on Brett!" [...] And I was, like, [...] "What the <b>fuck</b> <b>are</b> you talking about?" [...] But to this day, that's what people remember." ...|$|E

2500|$|The film's ending also changed, {{the final}} version being written halfway through filming. The {{original}} intended to depict Johnny Depp in Riggan's dressing room with a Pirates of the Caribbean poster in the back. Iñárritu grew to strongly dislike this ending, calling it [...] "so embarrassing", and rewrote it with Dinelaris and Giacobone after a new ending came {{to him in a}} dream. Iñárritu was reluctant to describe the original ending but it was leaked by Dinelaris. He said the original ending was set in the theatre instead of the hospital, and involved Depp putting on Riggan Thomson's wig, and in Jack Sparrow's voice [...] "...the poster asks Depp, 'What the <b>fuck</b> <b>are</b> we doing here, mate?' and {{it was going to be}} the satire of the endless loop of that." [...] The director and co-authors ruled out the satirical ending, and favored the new, more ambiguous, ending.|$|E
2500|$|... "Bullet the Blue Sky" [...] first {{originated}} as a demo recorded {{during a}} jam session at STS Studios in Dublin with producer Paul Barrett, {{prior to the}} proper Joshua Tree recording sessions. While listening to a song by English rock band the Fall, U2 guitarist the Edge tried to emulate its guitar riff, but instead came up with his own part that was [...] "uptempo, like real hard-hitting". (It eventually became the chorus for [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky".) Bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen Jr. then joined in playing at half-time. Lead vocalist Bono recalled that Clayton was also playing in a different key from the Edge. The guitarist became irritated, as the rhythm section was playing much differently than how he thought they should. He thought, [...] "What the <b>fuck</b> <b>are</b> they doing?", and considered stopping the jam. After the take was completed, the band listened to playback {{in the control room}} and realised that the demo was [...] "absolutely brilliant". Compared to {{the final version of the}} song, the Edge described the demo as a [...] "much more bare-boned, like a heavy funk track". Still, the song was discarded for some time until producer Brian Eno, who described it as a [...] "homeless riff", convinced the band it was worth working on.|$|E
