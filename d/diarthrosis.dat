5000|$|... {{synovial}} joint (also {{known as a}} <b>diarthrosis)</b> - freely movable. Synovial joints can in turn be classified into six groups according {{to the type of}} movement they allow: plane joint, ball and socket joint, hinge joint, pivot joint, condyloid joint and saddle joint.|$|E
50|$|The {{shoulder}} joint (or glenohumeral joint from Greek glene, eyeball, + -oid, 'form of', + Latin humerus, shoulder) is structurally {{classified as a}} synovial {{ball and socket joint}} and functionally as a <b>diarthrosis</b> and multiaxial joint. It involves articulation between the glenoid cavity of the scapula (shoulder blade) {{and the head of the}} humerus (upper arm bone).|$|E
50|$|A {{synovial}} joint, {{also known}} as <b>diarthrosis,</b> joins bones with a fibrous joint capsule that is continuous with the periosteum of the joined bones, constitutes the outer boundary of a synovial cavity, and surrounds the bones' articulating surfaces. The synovial cavity/joint is filled with synovial fluid. The joint capsule {{is made up of}} an outer layer, the articular capsule, which keeps the bones together structurally, and an inner layer, the synovial membrane, which seals in the synovial fluid.|$|E
5000|$|Joint capsule: the fibrous capsule, {{continuous}} {{with the}} periosteum of articulating bones, surrounds the <b>diarthrosis</b> and unites the articulating bones; the joint capsule {{consists of two}} layers - (1) the outer fibrous membrane that may contain ligaments and (2) the inner synovial membrane that secretes the lubricating, shock absorbing, and joint-nourishing synovial fluid; the joint capsule is highly innervated, but without blood and lymph vessels, and receives nutrition from the surrounding blood supply via either diffusion (a slow process) or by convection, a far more efficient process achieved through exercise.|$|E
50|$|The {{sternoclavicular joint}} or sternoclavicular {{articulation}} is the joint between the manubrium of the sternum and the clavicle bone. It is structurally classed as a synovial saddle joint and functionally classed as a <b>diarthrosis</b> and biaxial joint. It {{is composed of}} two portions separated by an articular disc of fibrocartilage. The bone areas entering into its formation are the sternal end of the clavicle, the upper and lateral part of the sternum, (the clavicular notch), and the cartilage of the first rib, visible from the outside as the suprasternal notch. The articular surface of the clavicle is much larger {{than that of the}} sternum, and is invested with a layer of cartilage, which is considerably thicker than that on the sternum.|$|E
40|$|International audienceOnly two distal epiphyses of a radius and ulna are consensually {{attributed}} to the holotype skeleton of Proconsul heseloni, KNM-RU 2036. Here, we describe seven adult and immature distal antebrachial (radial and ulnar) epiphyses from two other individuals of P.  heseloni from the Lower Miocene deposits of the Kaswanga Primate Site (KPS), Rusinga Island, Kenya. Because KNM-RU 2036 and KNM-KPS individuals III and VIII are conspecific and penecontemporaneous, their comparison provides the opportunity i) to characterize, for the first time, the morphological variation of the distal radioulnar joint in a Miocene ape, P.  heseloni, and ii) to investigate the functional and evolutionary implications. Our {{results show that the}} distal antebrachial epiphyses of KNM-KPS III and VIII correspond to stages of bone maturation that are more advanced than those of KNM-RU 2036 (larger articulations and sharper articular borders and ligament attachments that are more developed). Accordingly, functional interpretations based solely on the skeleton of KNM-RU 2036 have involved an underestimation of the forearm rotation abilities of P.  heseloni. In particular, the KPS fossils do not exhibit the primitive morphology of distal radioulnar syndesmosis, as those of KNM-RU 2036 and most nonhominoid primates, but rather the morphology of an incipient <b>diarthrosis</b> (as in extant lorisines and hominoids). The distal radioulnar <b>diarthrosis</b> permits more mobility and maintenance of the wrist during repeated and slow rotation of the forearms, which facilitates any form of quadrupedal locomotion on discontinuous and variably oriented supports. By providing the oldest evidence of a distal radioulnar joint in an early Miocene hominoid, the main conclusions of this study are consistent with the role of cautious climbing as a prerequisite step for the emergence of positional adaptations in apes...|$|E
40|$|Curculigo orchioides Gaertn. (Hypoxidaceae) is {{popularly known}} as black musali in India. The rhizome as well as {{tuberous}} roots of the plant has been extensively used in indigenous system of medicine in India, Pakistan and China, {{for the treatment of}} various diseases including jaundice, asthma and <b>diarthrosis.</b> The juice extracted from the rhizome has also been used as a tonic to overcome impotency, to prevent bone loss, for antidiabetic activity, antitumor activity and antibacterial activity. The active principles that have been reported are flavones, glycosides, steroids, saponins, triterpenoids. The plant is propagated itself in nature through seeds and grows only during rainy season. Poor seed setting and poor seed germination restricts the natural multiplication. Associated with these, over-exploitation and habitat destruction has lead to the present endangered status of this plant, the need for in vitro conservation of this plant is crucial. Therefore the present review is an attempt to focus on in vitro Propagation studies of this important medicinal plant...|$|E
