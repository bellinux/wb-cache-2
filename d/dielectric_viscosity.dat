40|$|ABSTRACT: Due {{to their}} {{nonlinear}} properties, ferroelectric materials are ideal candidates for smart materials. Degradation properties such as low voltage breakdown, fatigue, and aging have been major problems in commercial applications of these materials. Such degradations affect {{the lifetime of}} ferroelectric materials. Therefore, {{it is important to}} understand degradation for reliability improvement. In this article, recent studies on fatigue and hysteresis of ferroelectric ceramics such as Lead Zir-conate Titanate (PZT) thin films is reviewed. A new fatigue model is discussed in detail which is based on effective one-directional movement of defects by internal field difference, defect entrapment at the ferroelectrics-electrode interface, and resultant polarization loss at the interface. A fatigue equation derived from this model is presented. Fatigue parameters such as initial polarization, piling constant, and decay constant are defined from the fatigue equation and voltage and temperature de-pendence of fatigue parameters are discussed. The jump distance of defect calculated from voltage dependence of the decay constant is close to the lattice constant of ferroelectric materials, which im-plies that oxygen or lead vacancies migrate either parallel or antiparallel to the polarization direc-tion. From the temperature dependence of the decay constant, it is shown that the activation energy for domain wall movement plays an important role in fatigue. The hysteresis model of ferroelectrics is shown using polarization reversal. The hysteresis loop is made by four polarization stages: nucleation, growth, merging, and shrinkage of domains. The hysteresis equation confirms that <b>dielectric</b> <b>viscosity</b> controls hysteresis properties, and temperature dependence of the coefficient of <b>dielectric</b> <b>viscosity</b> is also discussed in conjunction with fatigue mechanism...|$|E

These carbons having a wide pore distribution ranges from micropores to macropores in conjunction with a random pore connection that facilitates the high specific-capacitance values. Pore distribution plays a central role in controlling the capacitance value of EDLCs, since electrolyte distribution inside the active material mainly depends on the pore distribution. This has a direct influence on the distribution of resistance and capacitance values within the electrode. As a result, preparation of electrodes remains a vital issue in realising high-performance EDLCs. Generally, carbon materials along with some binders are dispersed into a solvent and coated onto the current collectors. This study examines the role of binder solvents used for the carbon-ink preparation on the microstructure of the electrodes and the consequent performance of the EDLCs.

All these equations are coupled through the temperature-dependent liquid <b>dielectric</b> constant, <b>viscosity,</b> and thermal conductivity.

40|$|Standard {{continuum}} theory {{fails to}} predict several key experimental results of electrostatic and electrokinetic measurements at aqueous electrolyte interfaces. In order {{to extend the}} continuum theory to include the effects of molecular solvent structure, we generalize the equations for electrokinetic transport to incorporate a space dependent <b>dielectric</b> profile, <b>viscosity</b> profile, and non-electrostatic interaction potential. All necessary profiles are extracted from atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We show that the MD results for the ion-specific distribution of counterions at charged hydrophilic and hydrophobic interfaces are accurately reproduced using the dielectric profile of pure water and a non-electrostatic repulsion in an extended Poisson-Boltzmann equation. The distributions of Na(+) at both surface types and Cl(-) at hydrophilic surfaces can be modeled using linear dielectric response theory, whereas for Cl(-) at hydrophobic surfaces {{it is necessary to}} apply nonlinear response theory. The extended Poisson-Boltzmann equation reproduces the experimental values of the double-layer capacitance for many different carbon-based surfaces. In conjunction with a generalized hydrodynamic theory that accounts for a space dependent viscosity, the model captures the experimentally observed saturation of the electrokinetic mobility {{as a function of the}} bare surface charge density and the so-called anomalous double-layer conductivity.

In this study, using pore network modeling, we develop correlation equations for deposition rate coefficients for nano particle transport under unfavorable conditions at the Darcy scale based on pore-scale mechanisms. The upscaling tool is a multi-directional pore-network model consisting of an interconnected network of pores with variable connectivities. Correlation equations describing the pore-averaged deposition rate coefficients under unfavorable conditions in a cylindrical pore, developed in our earlier studies, are employed for each pore element. Pore-network simulations are performed {{for a wide range of}} parameter values to obtain the breakthrough curves of nanoparticle concentration. The latter is fitted with macroscopic 1 -D advection-dispersion equation with a two-site linear reversible deposition accounting for both equilibrium and kinetic sorption. This leads to the estimation of three Darcy-scale deposition coefficients: distribution coefficient, kinetic rate constant, and the fraction of equilibrium sites.

The different multi-site models are categorised in terms of bond rigidity/flexibility and polarization. The models are assessed {{for their ability to}} reproduce experimental values at conditions ranging from ambient to supercritical conditions.

However, mineral oils are non-renewable materials and have a low level biodegradability; their level of biodegradability is not more than 30 %. For that purpose, the development of vegetable oils is being continuously performed by many researchers and industries to replace mineral oils. These natural products present a high biodegradability, non-toxicity and higher fire safety guarantee. In general, vegetable oils which have been used today are derived from food material such as soybeans, palm, corn, sunflower and others. In this paper, we first introduce a new vegetable oil derived from a non-food material we called “JMEO (jatropha curcas methyl ester oil) ”. JMEO is produced by alkaline esterification process of jatropha curcas oil which comes from the pressing of jatropha fruits. Jatropha curcas are non-edible crop that can grow in all types of soil in tropical and subtropical regions and even in barren soils with low rainfall. Moreover, these plants do not need much fertilizer. Then we present the results of a comparison of statistical AC breakdown voltage in JMEO and mineral oil (naphtenic type). Breakdown voltage (BDV) measurements have been performed on series of 40 tests basing on IEC 60156 Standard. Hypothesis test of conformity to normal distribution of BDV is carried out by applying Shapiro-Wilk tests to calculate W-value and P-value and skewness and kurtosis test. We mainly analyze histogram, probability of oil samples, mean and standard deviation. It appears from the obtained results that the BDV of JMEO is better than that of mineral oil. Thus, JMEO (jatropha curcas methyl ester oil) constitutes a potential liquid for replacing mineral oil in high voltage equipment and especially in high voltage power transformer...|$|R
40|$|By {{now it is}} well {{established}} that the structural α-relaxation time, τ α, of non-associated small molecular and polymeric glass-formers obey thermodynamic scaling. In other words, τ α {{is a function of}} the product variable, ργ /T, where ρ is the density and T the temperature. The constant γ as well as the function, τ α = (ργ /T), is material dependent. Actually this dependence of τ α on ργ /T originates from the dependence on the same product variable of the Johari-Goldstein β-relaxation time, τ β, or the primitive relaxation time, τ 0, of the coupling model. To support this assertion, we give evidences from various sources itemized as follows. (1) The invariance of the relation between τ α and τ β or τ 0 to widely different combinations of pressure and temperature. (2) Experimental <b>dielectric</b> and <b>viscosity</b> data of glass-forming van der Waals liquids and polymer. (3) Molecular dynamics simulations of binary Lennard-Jones (LJ) models, the Lewis–Wahnström model of orthoterphenyl, 1, 4 polybutadiene, a room temperature ionic liquid, 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium nitrate, and a molten salt 2 Ca(NO 3) 2 · 3 KNO 3 (CKN). (4) Both diffusivity and structural relaxation time, as well as the breakdown of Stokes-Einstein relation in CKN obey thermodynamic scaling by ργ /T with the same γ. (5) In polymers, the chain normal mode relaxation time, τ N, is another function of ργ /T with the same γ as segmental relaxation time τ α. (6) While the data of τ α from simulations for the full LJ binary mixture obey very well the thermodynamic scaling, it is strongly violated when the LJ interaction potential is truncated beyond typical inter-particle distance, although in both cases the repulsive pair potentials coincide for some distances...|$|R
40|$|Oligo(ethylene oxide) -functionalized trialkoxysilanes were {{synthesized}} through hydrosilylation reaction by reacting trialkoxysilane with oligo(ethylene oxide) allyl {{methyl ether}} using PtO 2 as a catalyst. The physical properties of these compounds, such as <b>viscosity,</b> <b>dielectric</b> constant, and ionic conductivity, were characterized. Among them, [3 -(2 -(2 -methoxyethoxy) ethoxy) -propyl]triethoxysilane (TESM 2) exhibited a commercial viable ionic conductivity of 1. 14 mS cm(- 1) {{and a wide}} electrochemical window of 5. 2 V. A preliminary investigation was conducted by using TESM 2 as an electrolyte solvent for high-voltage applications in lithium-ion batteries. Using 1 M LiPF 6 in TESM 2 with 1 vol% vinyl carbonate as an electrolyte, LiCoO 2 /Li half-cell delivered a specific capacity of 153. 9 mAh g(- 1) and 90 % capacity retention after 80 cycles (3. 0 - 4. 35 V, 28 mA g(- 1)); Li 1. 2 Ni 0. 2 Mn 0. 6 O 2 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 full cell exhibited the initial capacity of 161. 3 mAh g(- 1) and 86 % capacity retention after 30 cycles (0. 5 - 3. 1 V, 18 mA g(- 1)) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{spectral}} ratio {{method is}} used to calculate the quality factor (Q) in porous rock samples at ultrasonic frequencies (0. 3 - 1. 5 MHz). The data were collected using the pulse transmission technique with aluminum used as a high Q standard. The data set consists of dry, water and benzene saturated rocks at differential pressures from zero to one kilobar. Two sandstones, Berea and Kayenta, Bedford limestone, and Webatuck dolomite are studied. Water and benzene were chosen as pore fluid saturants to contrast the effects of two different pore fluids (density, compressibility, <b>viscosity,</b> <b>dielectric</b> constant, and wetting properties) at ultrasonic frequencies. The main features observed are: 1) The quality factor Q increases with increasing confining pressure; at low pressures the rate of increase is larger. 2) Q for saturated samples is generally lower than for dry samples. 3) The introduction of a fluid saturant into a dry rock increases S-wave attenuation more than P-wave attenuation. 4) In general, given the measurement error and the fact that these results are preliminary, the differences in attenuation between the two fluid saturations, water and benzene, are not large. Nevertheless, we observe that benzene-saturated attenuations are slightly higher than water-saturated values, particularly at lower pressures (less than 500 bars) for the P-wave...|$|R
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of photodegradation of levofloxacin in solution on UV irradiation in the pH range 2. 0 – 12. 0 {{has been}} studied using a HPLC method. Levofloxacin undergoes first-order kinetics {{in the initial stages}} of the reaction and the apparent first-order rate constants are of the order of 0. 167 to 1. 807 × 10 – 3 min– 1. The rate-pH profile is represented by a curve indicating the presence of cationic, dipolar and anionic species during the reaction. The singly ionized form of the molecule is non-fluorescent and is less susceptible to photodegradation. The increase in the degradation rate in the pH range 5. 0 – 9. 0 may be due to greater reactivity of the ionized species existing in that range. The rate appears to vary with a change in the degree of ionization of the species present in a particular pH range and their susceptibility to photodegradation. Above pH 9, the decrease in the rate of photodegradation may be result of deprotonation of the piperazinyl group. The levofloxacin molecule is more stable in the pH range around 7, which is then suitable for formulation purposes. The photodegradation of levofloxacin was found to be affected by the <b>dielectric</b> constant and <b>viscosity</b> of the medium...|$|R
