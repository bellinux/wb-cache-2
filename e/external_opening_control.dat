40|$|Many dinosaurs have {{enormous}} and complicated bony nasal apertures. Func-tional interpretation requires {{knowledge of the}} location of the <b>external</b> <b>opening</b> in the skin. Traditionally, the ßeshy nostril of dinosaurs has been placed {{in the back of the}} bony opening, but studies of extant dinosaur relatives suggest that it is located far forward. Narial blood supply and cavernous tissue corroborate the rostral position in dinosaurs. A rostral nostril was, and remains, a virtually invariant rule of construction among Amniota, which has consequences for (i) nasal airstreaming, and hence various physiological parameters, and (ii) the collection of behaviorally relevant circumoral odorants. Nasal structures play a role in many well-studied biological functions, ranging be-yond olfaction and respiration to manipu-lation, behavioral display, and thermal physiology (1).

40|$|Fistula in ano is an {{inflammatory}} condition affecting perianal re gion and adjacent structures. It {{is a cause}} of significant morbidity, requiring repeated surgical treatments due to its high recurrence rate. Most perianal fistulous disease have <b>external</b> <b>openings</b> located within 2. 5 cm of the anal verge. It is rare for an anal fistula to involve the scrotum. Such involvement can occur frequently in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, especially Crohn’s disease and rarely in ulcerative colitis. Isolated involvement of scrotal region is quite rare without concomitant inflammatory bowel disease. This has been rarely reported in the literature.

30|$|The {{location}} of <b>external</b> <b>openings</b> {{is of little}} importance, since both {{the patient and the}} surgeon can find it often easily themselves. Goodsall’s rule states that the <b>external</b> <b>opening</b> of a fistula situated behind the transverse anal line will open into the anal canal in the midline posteriorly. An anterior opening is usually associated with a radial tract, however. The exception to the rule is anterior fistulas lying more than 3  cm from the anus, which may have a curved track (similar to posterior fistulas) [27]. This rule is, however, not without many exceptions [28]. The internal opening will decide the extent of sphincter division during fistulotomy. Since the dentate line cannot be identified on MRI, its position must be inferred as the middle of the anal canal. If no internal opening can be detected, then a sinus should be diagnosed instead of a fistula.|$|R

Then, we explore the relation between market access and economic activity empirically, using data for European regions, and we simulate the impact of EU enlargement on Objective 1 regions. Our predicted market-access induced gains in regional GDP and manufacturing employment are up to seven times larger in regions proximate to the new accession countries than in “interior” EU regions. We also find that a future Balkans enlargement could be particularly effective in reducing economic inequalities among the EU periphery, due to the positive impact on relative market access of Greek regions...|$|R
40|$|Fistula-in-ano is {{the most}} common form of perineal sepsis. Typically, a fistula {{includes}} an internal opening, a track, and an <b>external</b> <b>opening.</b> The <b>external</b> <b>opening</b> might acutely appear following infection and/or an abscess, or more insiduously in a chronic manner. Management includes control of infection, assessment of the fistulous track in relation to the anal sphincter muscle, and finally, definitive treatment of the fistula. Fistulotomy was the most commonly used mode of management, but concerns about post-fistulotomy incontinence prompted the use of sphincter preserving techniques such as advancement flaps, fibrin glue, collagen fistula plug, ligation of the intersphincteric fistula track, and stem cells. Many descriptive and comparative studies have evaluated these different techniques with variable outcomes. The lack of consistent results, level I evidence, or long-term follow-up, as well as the heterogeneity of fistula pathology has prevented a definitive treatment algorithm. This article will review the most commonly available modalities and techniques for managing idiopathic fistula-in-ano...|$|R
