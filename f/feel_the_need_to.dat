5|$|I’m single. For {{the first}} time in my life, I’m really {{experiencing}} what that’s like because I used to always <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be in a relationship; I didn’t like being alone. But this time I’m realizing that people come into your life for a season, and my last relationship served its purpose. I can’t sit here and cry about it, because it ended right where it should have. A lot of that stuff is on the album.|$|E

25|$|More {{difficult}} are {{situations where}} the countries asking for support, such as ASEAN and allies both can offer sensitive HUMINT, but want to exchange for SIGINT from the US or allies such as Australia. These exchanges can be immensely valuable, but both sides may <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> sanitize detailed sources.|$|E

25|$|When people's {{personal}} space is violated, they feel suffocated and <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> free themselves and be independent. People who have SPD {{tend to be}} happiest {{when they are in}} a relationship in which the partner places few emotional or intimate demands on them. It is not people as such that they want to avoid, but emotions both negative and positive, emotional intimacy, and self-disclosure.|$|E
25|$|Western {{designers}} often <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> {{tinker with}} the proa. They are {{attracted by the}} minimalist nature and amazing speeds that proas are capable of (they may still be the fastest sailboats per dollar spent for the home builder) but they often want the proa to do more; adding cabins, different sailing rigs, and bidirectional rudders are common changes made. James Wharram was greatly influenced by the Proa design.|$|E
25|$|Most other {{orders were}} either smaller or less well {{organized}} than the Khatmiyyah. Moreover, {{unlike many other}} African Muslims, Sudanese Muslims did not all seem to <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> identify with one or another tariqa, even if the affiliation were nominal. Many Sudanese Muslims preferred more political movements that sought to change Islamic society and governance to conform to their own visions of {{the true nature of}} Islam.|$|E

25|$|Chidambaram and Tung {{found that}} group size mattered immensely in a group’s performance. The smaller the group, {{the more likely}} each member was to participate, {{regardless}} of range (dispersed or collocated). The main difference stated between distributed and collocated groups was the social pressure at least to appear busy that is present in collocated groups. When others are present, people <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> {{look as if they}} are working hard, while those who are not in the presence of others do not.|$|E
25|$|Stalin, who {{had earlier}} {{directed}} several population transfers in the Soviet Union, strongly supported the expulsions, which worked to the Soviet Union's advantage in several ways. The satellite states would now <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> {{be protected by}} the Soviets from German anger over the expulsions. The assets left by expellees in Poland and Czechoslovakia were successfully used to reward cooperation with the new governments, {{and support for the}} Communists was especially strong in areas that had seen significant expulsions. Settlers in these territories welcomed the opportunities presented by their fertile soils and vacated homes and enterprises, increasing their loyalty.|$|E
25|$|The {{member states}} can assess {{merchandise}} from these areas {{with the common}} external tariff used for Mercosur merchandise, or, {{in the case of}} certain special products, the domestic tariff prevailing in each individual state. In this way, the products from the free-trade zones can have the more favorable tax treatment established under Southern Common Market, given to the merchandise produced in the normal customs zones of each member state or, in the case of certain special products, can have the normal customs treatment prevailing in each nation. Products coming from outside of Mercosur are highly taxed so that local companies do not <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> compete with large international companies.|$|E

25|$|One {{explanation}} is that social-media users usually split their time between Facebook and interacting in the real world. When something entertaining happens in real life, people <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> share it. It might seem harmless, however at some point people begin to substitute one reality with another. As a result, people start to change their behavior and even their assumptions about life, love and friendships, based on the Facebook reality. This leads to cognitive dissonance. Such a discrepancy between perceptions and beliefs can damage people's emotional balance and lead them to experience identity confusion, relationship conflicts, changes in judgement, and even psychotic break.|$|E
25|$|Weinzweig’s {{move toward}} {{serialism}} {{was not a}} complete transition; he was very selective and deliberate in which principles he chose to adopt. While he acknowledged that Schoenberg’s influence on the musical world was powerful, he was not particularly taken with Schoeberg’s music and preferred that of composers such as Berg and Webern. His attraction to serialism {{was not the same}} as that of its Viennese founders. Since he was not taught strictly using tonality in his early education, he did not <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> rebel and use serialism simply as a means to avoid tonality. While he often employed the techniques used by Stravinsky, Bartók, Copland and Varèse, he did not teach these methods to his students exclusively.|$|E
25|$|The highest {{military}} {{death toll}} from an IRA attack came on 27 August 1979, with the Warrenpoint ambush in County Down, when 18 British soldiers from the Parachute Regiment were killed by two culvert bombs placed by the Provisional IRA South Armagh Brigade, a unit that didn't <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> adopt the cell structure because of its history of successfully avoiding intelligence failures. On the same day, the IRA killed {{one of their most}} famous victims, Lord Louis Mountbatten, assassinated along with two teenagers (aged 14 and 15) and the Dowager Baroness Brabourne in County Sligo, by a bomb placed in his boat. Another effective IRA tactic devised in the late 1970s was the use of home-made mortars mounted on the back of trucks which were fired at police and army bases. These mortars were first tested in 1974 but did not kill anyone until 1979.|$|E

25|$|Common {{ostriches}} typically avoid {{humans in}} the wild, since they correctly assess humans as potential predators. If approached, they often run away, but sometimes ostriches {{can be very}} aggressive when threatened, especially if cornered, and may also attack if they <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> defend their territories or offspring. Similar behaviors are noted in captive or domesticated common ostriches, which retain the same natural instincts and can occasionally respond aggressively to stress. When attacking a person, common ostriches deliver slashing kicks with their powerful feet, armed with long claws, with which they can disembowel or kill {{a person with a}} single blow. In one study of common ostrich attacks, it was estimated that two to three attacks that result in serious injury or death occur each year in the area of Oudtshoorn, South Africa, where a large number of common ostrich farms are set next to both feral and wild common ostrich populations.|$|E
25|$|Problematic point(s): it is {{not always}} known whether a {{specific}} form is actually the official name of an institution, or what is its official name (e.g. whether the city of its location is part of the name). In addition, {{it is not}} always clear if a group is actually an institution in the sense of having been registered at the court, with a statute, a stamp, letter header etc. on its own. A third problem is {{the question of whether the}} spelling of an organization can be corrected if it is not written according to the above rule. In addition, adjectival forms derived from institution names are also often mistaken because people <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> distinguish them from genuine common names (especially if the name contains a fancy name that becomes identical with a common name if written in lowercase). Furthermore, it is unclear why cinemas are treated differently (see above) from theatres, cf. Művész mozi, but Magyar Színház.|$|E
25|$|The final 10-minute {{shoot-out}} {{began with}} very close lap times. As the chequered flag fell everyone {{was on their}} final lap. Button {{was the first of}} the main contenders to cross it for the final time and he didn't improve and stayed 5th. Next was Barrichello as he crossed the line and didn't improve and stayed 2nd. Kovalainen looked set for pole position but a lockup and a slide in the final corner could only get him up into second, so Hamilton didn't <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> complete his lap with no one else on fast laps. Hamilton got his first pole position of the season, but more importantly, it was a McLaren 1–2. Barrichello came third and a surprise 4th for Vettel as he split the Brawns. Räikkönen even with race fuel on board posted a lap time that was 1.279 seconds quicker than Luca Badoer's time in Q1 on low fuel. This was also the first time Lewis Hamilton had been on pole since the 2008 Chinese Grand Prix.|$|E

500|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, the parish's workers felt that regular churches' attitudes towards metalheads, rockers and punks {{had become more}} permissive, and {{therefore}} did not <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> keep Sanctuary going on any longer, hence, most of the parishes of Sanctuary were closed. Sanctuary became Sanctuary International, and it currently gives international studies and lessons on Christianity. Sanctuary also runs an internet radio station called [...] "Intense Radio" [...] which, in 2003, reached approximately 150,000 listeners.|$|E
