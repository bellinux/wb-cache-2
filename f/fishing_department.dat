50|$|The dead caribou {{drifting}} {{and beginning}} to accumulate along the eastern shore line of the Koksoak River were first noted by the residents of Kuujjuaq, but {{the cause of the}} deaths was not confirmed until a team of wildlife biologists and technicians from the Newfoundland-Labrador Wildlife Division arrived by helicopter to participate in a joint cooperative effort with the Québec Recreation, Hunting and <b>Fishing</b> <b>Department</b> to live-capture and radio-collar caribou swimming across the Koksoak River. Kuujjuaq residents, who were familiar with the river, reported seasonal water levels far higher than normally recorded in recent history. Autumn boat stages, shore line cabin sites and tributary beaver lodges were being flooded. While the dead caribou were thought to have drowned, confirmation was not determined until the Newfoundland-Labrador Wildlife Division used the helicopter to trace the increasingly larger accumulations of floating dead caribou back approximately 115 km upstream from Kuujjuaq to the base of Calcaire (Limestone) Falls on the Caniapiscau River. Coves and backwater were choked with the floating carcasses of dead caribou, with accumulations becoming increasingly larger in approaching the base of the Falls.|$|E
40|$|The Bahi wetland is {{a shallow}} ephemeral lake located in central Tanzania, {{approximately}} 60 km north-east {{of the city}} of Dodoma. Several studies have highlighted the importance of the lake and the surrounding wetland to local communities, who utilize it for cultivation, livestock keeping and <b>fishing</b> (<b>Department</b> of Irrigation and Technical Services, 2004; Yanda et al., 2007). Located within the Bahi depression, a downwarped section of the Eastern Rift Valley, between latitudes 05 o 51 ’ and 06 o 20 ’ south and longitudes 34 o 59 ’ and 35 o 21 ’ east, the lake has a surface area of approximately 974 km 2 (Figure 1) and lies at an altitude of 830 masl. There is no outflow from the lake, which consequently varies considerably in size depending on precipitation in the catchment area. In some years the lake dries completely. The Bahi wetland receives water from various seasonal rivers, mainly draining from the north. Of these the Bubu and Mponde are the largest. Other rivers flowing into the lake are the Lawila, Nkojigwe, Msemembo, Maduma and Zuboro. The total catchment area of the lake is 23, 447 km 2. All the rivers are ephemeral, usually ceasing to flow during the dry season (i. e. May to December) ...|$|E
40|$|The Togolese lagoons provide {{subsistence}} to a {{large population}} of fishermen and traders. Various fishing practices are employed here but {{all are based on}} small scale fisheries, responsible for meeting the self-consumption demands of riverside families. Several years of drought and increasing fishing pressure have resulted in a deterioration of fishermen's living conditions. The diminishment of the catches indicates a state of stock-depletion. Some classic development measures can be proposed to improve this situation : limiting the fishing pressure, regulating the mesh size, prohibiting certain fishing gears and protecting spawning areas; but the <b>fishing</b> <b>department</b> seems hardly capable of imposing these, having no means of doing so. To achieve this, one must win the interest of the fishermen and once again give importance to traditional authorities, which in the past have become powerless. It is also possible to increase lagoon productivity by calling upon traditional customs which meet the demand of the fishermen better : the opening of the lagoon belt and traditional water farming techniques (Acadja). All these projects will require the intervention of a village council, the only authority which is capable of avoiding conflicts between the families. In Togo, and more generally speaking in Africa, the success of development projects depends upon a good cooperation between the administration and the customary structure. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

40|$|The {{intracellular}} pathogen resistance 1 (Ipr 1) gene {{has been}} reported {{to play a role in}} mediating innate immunity in a mouse model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, and polymorphisms of its human ortholog, SP 110 nuclear body protein, have been suggested to be associated with tuberculosis. Thus, the bovine SP 110 gene was considered to be a promising candidate for a genetic association study of bovine paratuberculosis, or Johne’s disease, a chronic granulomatous enteritis caused by Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP). Initially, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) within the bovine SP 110 gene were identified, and subsequently a population-based genetic association study was carried out. Seventeen new SNP along the SP 110 gene were identified in Holstein-Friesian cattle, and 6 more were compiled from public databases. A total of 14 SNP were included in the association study of 2 independent populations. The SNP c. 587 A>G was found to be significantly associated with MAP infection, with the major allele A appearing to confer greater disease susceptibility in one of the analyzed populations. In addition, 2 haplotypes containing this SNP were also found to be associated with infection in the same population. The SNP c. 587 A>G is a nonsynonymous mutation that causes an amino acid change in codon 196 from asparagine to serine. In silico analyses point to SNP c. 587 A>G as a putative causal variant for susceptibility to MAP infection. The elucidation of the precise mechanism by which this SNP can exert its effect in the protein and, as a result, in the risk of infection, requires future functional analyses. Likewise, the absence of genetic association in one of the analyzed populations renders it necessary to carry out this study in other independent populations, with the aim of substantiating the repeatability of the present results. Nevertheless, the present results deepen our understanding of the genetic basis of susceptibility and resistance mechanisms related to MAP infection in cattle and, in turn, constitute a step forward toward the implementation of marker-assisted selection in breeding programs aimed at controlling paratuberculosis. This study was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science (MEC, AGL 2006 - 14315 -C 02 - 02 /GAN), the University of the Basque Country (Leioa, Spain), Bizkaiberri program of Biscay Regional Government, Aberekin Insemination Centre, and the Agriculture and <b>Fishing</b> <b>Department</b> of the Basque Government (Derio, Spain) ...|$|E

The study object was about the application of fishing and sea business at Lamongan residence {{from the perspective of}} Regional Rule No. 7 / 2004 about retribution of Fishing and Sea Business license study and problems in license application and efforts to reveal the problems in retribution. The method used is by using socio-juridical method, which was the approach learned empirically the reciprocity relation between law and social phenomena. We used this method since the discussion object would be related with law in juridical way and studying several rule related with the application of fishing and sea business from the perspective of section 2 regional rule No. 7 / 2004 about Retribution of fishing and sea business in Lamongan residence and also sociological research to find out the inhibition in facing odd factors from the license application in Lamongan Residence. According to the application of fishing and sea business license arranged in section 2 regional rule No. 7 / 2004 about Retribution of fishing and sea business, the fishing and sea business license was held by the License Department of Lamongan residence. The application basically not only for the License Department but also involved <b>Fishing</b> <b>Department</b> and Fishing General Directorate of Brondong. The people role in fishing and sea license business license was also the most important element in the process of fishing and sea business license. Basically, the inhibition in fishing and sea business license came from two sides, they were the applicant side from the society and institution or bureaucracy which inhibited the license system. The retribution of fishing and sea business license generally aimed to increase the people life-standard, so that by the license, the law guarantee from the fishing and sea entrepreneurs could be protected. The effort of regional government of Lamongan residence to increase the quality of public service in fishing and sea business license could be seen from the effort of License department which was cooperated with Fishing and Sea Research Department. Besides, in order to increase the ability of License Department of Lamongan Residence worker, the License Department was also done training for the officer to do good service for the society. They should be responsive, good manner, and polite in doing service to the society. According the License Department, part of their job was function to make people satisfied. According to the discussion and the research result, so there could be concluded that the ineffective of fishing and sea business license application from the section 2 regional rule No. 7 / 2004 about Retribution of fishing and sea business in Lamongan Residence, because of the ineffectiveness of the rule was not caused by the substance of the rule, but the application in bureaucracy and society who applied the process of fishing and sea business license...|$|E
