25|$|The only sex steroid {{currently}} {{utilized in}} women {{that can cause}} virilization of female fetuses when administered in usually administered doses is the androgen danazol, a derivative of <b>ethisterone</b> (17α-ethinyl-testosterone).|$|E
25|$|In 1961, Ciba and Parke-Davis {{added the}} {{reported}} association of <b>ethisterone</b> and norethisterone with masculinization of external genitalia {{of the female}} fetus to the precautions section of their advertisements to physicians and physician prescribing information.|$|E
25|$|The {{first case}} reports of fetal masculinization of {{external}} genitalia of female infants born to mothers treated in pregnancy with high-dose <b>ethisterone</b> (17α-ethinyl-testosterone) and high-dose norethisterone (17α-ethinyl-19-nor-testosterone) to prevent miscarriage {{were published in}} 1957 and 1958, respectively.|$|E
25|$|In general, pregnane {{derivatives}} (progesterone, dydrogesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, etc.) do not virilize even in high dose; testosterone derivatives (<b>ethisterone)</b> and 19-nortestosterone (norethisterone, norethisterone acetate, etc.) generally virilize, {{but there}} are exceptions (e.g. noretynodrel) that do not.|$|E
25|$|On June 21, 1976, the FDA {{approved}} the androgen danazol (Danocrine), a derivative of <b>ethisterone</b> (17α-ethinyl-testosterone), {{for treatment of}} endometriosis, with a warning that its use in pregnancy is contraindicated {{because of the risk}} of masculinization of external genitalia of female fetuses.|$|E
25|$|In a March 1960 JAMA article, {{pediatric}} endocrinologist Lawson Wilkins at Johns Hopkins {{reported on}} 34 cases of fetal masculinization of external genitalia of female infants born from 1950 to 1959 to mothers treated with high-dose (20–250mg/day) <b>ethisterone</b> to prevent miscarriage, and 35 cases of fetal masculinization of external genitalia of female infants born from 1957 to 1959 to mothers treated with high-dose (10–40mg/day) norethisterone to prevent miscarriage.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s, {{some studies}} {{suggested}} that progesterone could prevent threatened abortion and might prevent habitual abortion, but oral bioavailability of progesterone {{is low and}} injections of progesterone can be painful, so orally active progestins were tried beginning with <b>ethisterone,</b> followed by other progestins as they became available: northynodrel (Enovid) and norethisterone (Norlutin) in 1957, medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera) in 1959, norethisterone acetate (Norlutate) in 1961, and dydrogesterone (Duphaston) in 1962.|$|E
25|$|NET {{displays}} 8 {{times higher}} progestational activity than progesterone. It {{is also a}} potent progestogen and binds to the PR with approximately 150% of the affinity of progesterone. In contrast, its parent compounds, testosterone, nandrolone (19-nortestosterone), and <b>ethisterone</b> (17α-ethynyltestosterone), have 2%, 22%, and 44% of the relative binding affinity of progesterone for the PR. Unlike NET, its major active metabolite 5α-dihydro-NET (5α-DHNET), which is formed by 5α-reductase, {{has been found to}} possess both progestogenic and marked antiprogestogenic activity, although its affinity for the PR is greatly reduced relative to NET at only 25% of that of progesterone. NET produces similar changes in the endometrium and vagina and is similarly thermogenic in women compared to progesterone, which is in accordance with its progestogenic activity.|$|E
25|$|NET has {{approximately}} 15% of the affinity of the anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS) metribolone (R-1881) for the AR, and in accordance, is weakly androgenic. In {{contrast to}} NET, 5α-DHNET, the major metabolite of NET, shows higher {{affinity for the}} AR, with approximately 27% of the affinity of metribolone. However, although 5α-DHNET has higher affinity for the AR than NET, it has significantly diminished and in fact almost abolished androgenic potency in comparison to NET in rodent bioassays. Similar findings were observed for <b>ethisterone</b> (17α-ethynyltestosterone) and its 5α-reduced metabolite, whereas 5α-reduction enhanced both the AR affinity and androgenic potency of testosterone and nandrolone (19-nortestosterone) in rodent bioassays. As such, {{it appears that the}} ethynyl group of NET at the C17α position is responsible for its loss of androgenicity upon 5α-reduction.|$|E
25|$|NET was {{synthesized}} for {{the first}} time by chemists Luis Miramontes, Carl Djerassi, and George Rosenkranz at Syntex in Mexico City in 1951. It was the first highly active oral progestogen to be synthesized, and was preceded (as a progestogen) by progesterone (1934), <b>ethisterone</b> (1938), 19-norprogesterone (1944), and 17α-methylprogesterone (1949), as well as by nandrolone (1950), whereas noretynodrel (1952), and norethandrolone (1953) followed the synthesis of NET. The drug was first introduced, alone as Norlutin, in the United States in 1957. NET was subsequently introduced in combination with mestranol as Ortho-Novum in the U.S. in 1963, and was the second progestin, after noretynodrel in 1960, to be used in an oral contraceptive. In 1964, additional contraceptive preparations containing NET in combination with mestranol or EE, such as Norlestrin and Norinyl, were marketed in the U.S.|$|E

2500|$|NET, {{also known}} as 17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone or as 17α-ethynylestra-4-en-17β-ol-3-one, is a {{synthetic}} estrane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is specifically a derivative of testosterone in which an ethynyl group has been added at the C17α position and the methyl group at the C19 position has been removed; hence, it is a combined derivative of <b>ethisterone</b> (17α-ethynyltestosterone) and nandrolone (19-nortestosterone). These modifications result in gaining progestogenic and oral activity and reducing androgenic activity.|$|E

50|$|Based on {{in vitro}} research, <b>ethisterone</b> and {{norethisterone}} are about equipotent in their EC50 {{values for the}} androgen receptor (AR), whereas, conversely, norethisterone shows markedly increased potency relative to <b>ethisterone</b> {{in terms of its}} EC50 for the progesterone receptor (PR). As such, there is a considerable separation in the ratios of androgenic and progestogenic activity for <b>ethisterone</b> and norethisterone. Moreover, at the larger dosages in which it is used to achieve equivalent progestogenic effect, <b>ethisterone</b> has strong androgenic effects relative to norethisterone and other 19-nortestosterone progestins, and this has limited its clinical use.|$|E
50|$|Dimethisterone {{was derived}} from {{modification}} of <b>ethisterone</b> via introduction of methyl groups at the C6α and C21 positions. Relative to <b>ethisterone,</b> it is 12 times as potent orally as a progestogen in animals (Clauberg test), and, unlike <b>ethisterone,</b> is a pure progestogen with no androgenic (or estrogenic) activity in animals even at very high doses (although some weak antimineralocorticoid activity was observed at high doses in animals). However, {{in spite of its}} improved potency over <b>ethisterone,</b> it is a weak progestogen relative to most other progestins, in fact one of the weakest known.|$|E
50|$|Danazol, {{also known}} as 2,3-isoxazol-17α-ethynyltestosterone? or as 17α-ethynyl-17β-hydroxyandrost-4-en-2,3-disoxazole, is a {{synthetic}} androstane steroid and derivative of <b>ethisterone</b> (17α-ethynyltestosterone). It is specifically the derivative of <b>ethisterone</b> where the C3 ketone is replaced with a 2,3-isoxazole moiety.|$|E
50|$|The {{improved}} {{potency of}} dimethisterone due to 6α-methylation reportedly {{served as the}} basis for the synthesis of medroxyprogesterone acetate. Whereas hydroxyprogesterone acetate (the 6α-demethylated analogue of medroxyprogesterone acetate) is around twice as potent as <b>ethisterone</b> orally, medroxyprogesterone acetate shows 10 to 25 times the potency of <b>ethisterone.</b>|$|E
50|$|High dosages of {{norethisterone}} and noretynodrel, {{which are}} 19-nortestosterone derivatives of <b>ethisterone,</b> {{were found to}} be associated with high rates of estrogenic side effects such as breast enlargement in women and gynecomastia in men, as well as with improvement of menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women. In contrast, <b>ethisterone</b> and other progestogens such as progesterone and hydroxyprogesterone caproate were not associated with such effects, suggesting that they are either not estrogenic or are only weakly so. As such, <b>ethisterone</b> does not appear to share the estrogenic activity of norethisterone and noretynodrel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ethisterone</b> was {{synthesized}} in 1938 by Hans Herloff Inhoffen, Willy Logemann, Walter Hohlweg, and Arthur Serini at Schering AG in Berlin. It {{was derived}} from testosterone via ethynylation at the C17α position, and it was hoped, that, analogously to estradiol and ethinylestradiol, <b>ethisterone</b> would be an orally active form of testosterone. However, the androgenic activity of <b>ethisterone</b> was attenuated and it showed considerable progestogenic activity. As such, it was developed as a progestogen instead and was marketed in Germany in 1939 as Proluton C and by Schering in the U.S. in 1945 as Pranone, among other brand names.|$|E
50|$|Closely related analogues of <b>ethisterone</b> include vinyltestosterone, allyltestosterone, methyltestosterone, ethyltestosterone, and propyltestosterone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ethisterone</b> is {{described}} as a relatively weak progestogen, similarly to its analogue dimethisterone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ethisterone</b> (brand names Proluton C, Pranone among others), {{also known}} as ethinyltestosterone, pregneninolone, or anhydrohydroxyprogesterone, is a {{progestin}} with androgenic activity which was derived from testosterone and was introduced for medical use in 1939. It was the second progestogen to be marketed (intramuscular progesterone was introduced as Proluton in 1934) and was both the first orally active progestogen and the first progestin (synthetic progestogen) to be introduced. Although <b>ethisterone</b> has largely been superseded by newer drugs and is now little used, it reportedly continues to be available in some countries. Moreover, the 19-nortestosterone progestins, such as norethisterone, are derived from <b>ethisterone</b> and are widely used as hormonal contraceptives and for other indications.|$|E

50|$|Alkynylation finds use in {{synthesis}} of pharmaceuticals, {{particularly in the}} preparation of steroid hormones. For example, ethynylation of 17-ketosteroids produces important contraceptive medications known as progestins. Examples include drugs such as Norethisterone, <b>Ethisterone,</b> and Lynestrenol. Hydrogenation of these compounds produces anabolic steroids with oral bioavailability, such as Norethandrolone.|$|E
50|$|EE is an estrane steroid and a {{derivative}} of estradiol with an ethynyl substitution at the C17α position. It {{is also known}} as 17α-ethynylestradiol or as 17α-ethynylestra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17β-diol. The 17α-ethynylation of EE is analogous to the 17α-substitution of testosterone derivatives such as 17α-ethynylated progestins like <b>ethisterone</b> (17α-ethynyltestosterone) and norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) and 17α-alkylated anabolic-androgenic steroids like methyltestosterone (17α-methyltestosterone).|$|E
