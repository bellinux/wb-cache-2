40|$|In this work, {{we propose}} a novel method to model {{time-varying}} autoregressive impulsive signals, which possess skewed or symmetric Alpha Stable distributions. The main contribution {{of this work}} {{is its ability to}} model both the unknown autoregressive coefficients and the <b>distribution</b> <b>parameters,</b> where all of them are time-varying. This method is a generalization of previous work by the same authors where the modelling of time-varying autoregressive coefficients, under constant <b>distribution</b> <b>parameters</b> was performed merely for symmetric distributions. The proposed method is composed of a particle filter, by which the timevarying autoregressive coefficients and the <b>distribution</b> <b>parameters</b> can be estimated successfully. The performance of the proposed method is tested for different parameter values where the time variation of the autoregressive coefficients and the <b>distribution</b> <b>parameters</b> are considered to be sinusoidal or piecewise constant in time. The location parameter is taken to be either zero or a ramp waveform. The successful performance of the proposed method serves as a promising contribution in the modelling of impulsive signals, which are frequently seen in many areas, such as teletraffic in computer communications, radar and sonar applications and mobile communications...|$|R
