5|$|<b>Helium</b> (<b>He)</b> is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert {{monatomic}} {{chemical element}} that heads the noble gas {{series in the}} periodic table and whose atomic number is 2.

5|$|Six {{nonmetals}} occur naturally as monatomic noble gases: <b>helium</b> (<b>He),</b> neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and {{the radioactive}} radon (Rn).

5|$|The {{noble gases}} (historically also the inert gases) {{make up a}} group of {{chemical}} elements with similar properties; under standard conditions, they are all odorless, colorless, monatomic gases with very low chemical reactivity. The six noble gases that occur naturally are <b>helium</b> (<b>He),</b> neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and the radioactive radon (Rn). Oganesson (Og) is variously predicted to be a noble gas as well or to break the trend due to relativistic effects; its chemistry {{has not yet been}} investigated.|$|E

25|$|In this context, {{inert gas}} {{refers to a}} gas which is not metabolically active. Atmospheric {{nitrogen}} (N2) {{is the most common}} example, and <b>helium</b> (<b>He)</b> is the other inert gas commonly used in breathing mixtures for divers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Helium</b> (<b>He)</b> is an {{inert gas}} {{that is less}} {{narcotic}} than nitrogen at equivalent pressure (in fact {{there is no evidence}} for any narcosis from helium at all), so it is more suitable for deeper dives than nitrogen. Helium is equally able to cause decompression sickness. At high pressures, helium also causes high-pressure nervous syndrome, which is a CNS irritation syndrome which is in some ways opposite to narcosis.|$|E
25|$|Solubility of {{gases in}} liquids is {{influenced}} {{by the nature of the}} solvent liquid and the solute, the temperature, pressure, and the presence of other solutes in the solvent. Diffusion is faster in smaller, lighter molecules of which helium is the extreme example. Diffusivity of helium is 2.65 times faster than nitrogen. The concentration gradient, can be used as a model for the driving mechanism of diffusion. In this context, inert gas refers to a gas which is not metabolically active. Atmospheric nitrogen (N2) is the most common example, and <b>helium</b> (<b>He)</b> is the other inert gas commonly used in breathing mixtures for divers. Atmospheric nitrogen has a partial pressure of approximately 0.78bar at sea level. Air in the alveoli of the lungs is diluted by saturated water vapour (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2), a metabolic product given off by the blood, and contains less oxygen (O2) than atmospheric air as some of it is taken up by the blood for metabolic use. The resulting partial pressure of nitrogen is about 0,758bar.|$|E

2500|$|The only {{chemical}} {{elements that are}} stable diatomic homonuclear molecules at STP are hydrogen (H2), nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), and two halogens: fluorine (F2) and chlorine (Cl2). When grouped together with the monatomic noble gases [...] <b>helium</b> (<b>He),</b> neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and radon (Rn) [...] these gases are called [...] "elemental gases". Alternatively, they are sometimes known as [...] "molecular gases" [...] to distinguish them from molecules that are also chemical compounds.|$|E
2500|$|The Mercurian {{exosphere}} {{consists of}} a variety of species originating either from the Solar wind or from the planetary crust. The first constituents discovered were atomic hydrogen (H), <b>helium</b> (<b>He)</b> and atomic oxygen (O), which were observed by the ultraviolet radiation photometer of the Mariner 10 spaceprobe in 1974. The near-surface concentrations of these elements were estimated to vary from 230cm−3 for hydrogen to 44,000cm−3 for oxygen, with an [...] intermediate concentration of helium. In 2008 the MESSENGER probe confirmed the presence of atomic hydrogen, although its concentration appeared higher than the 1974 estimate. Mercury's exospheric hydrogen and helium are believed to come from the Solar wind, while the oxygen is likely to be of crustal origin.|$|E
2500|$|Scottish chemist and {{physicist}} James Dewar and the Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes took on {{the challenge}} to liquefy the remaining gases hydrogen and helium.

He lowered the temperature to the boiling point of helium [...] By reducing the pressure of the liquid <b>helium</b> <b>he</b> achieved an even lower temperature, near 1.5 K. These were the coldest temperatures achieved on earth at the time and his achievement earned him the Nobel Prize in 1913. Onnes would continue to study the properties of materials at temperatures near absolute zero, describing superconductivity and superfluids for the first time.|$|E
