5000|$|The International Accounting Standards IAS 32 and 39 help to give further {{direction}} for the proper accounting of derivative financial instruments. IAS 32 defines a “financial instrument” as “any contract that {{gives rise to a}} financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or <b>equity</b> <b>instrument</b> of another entity”. Therefore, a forward contract or option would create a financial asset for one entity and a financial liability for another. The entity required to pay the contract holds a liability, while the entity receiving the contract payment holds an asset. These would be recorded under the appropriate headings on the balance sheet of the respective companies. IAS 39 gives further instruction, stating that the financial derivatives be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet.IAS 39 defines two major types of hedges. The first is a cash flow hedge, defined as: “a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that (i) is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction, and (ii) could affect profit or loss”. In other words, a cash flow hedge is designed to eliminate the risk associated with cash transactions that can affect the amounts recorded in net income.|$|E

Tax rules significantly affect accounting practice in Luxembourg, for instance, some instruments may qualify as debt instruments under Lux GAAP while they are recognised as equity instruments above, for instance Convertible Preferred Equity Certificates (CPECs) which consist of preference shares which pay an interest to the investor but are accounted for as debt while they would typically meet the recognition criteria as an <b>equity</b> <b>instrument</b> under IAS 32. Generally speaking, substance over form has been made a non-mandatory accounting principle with the Law of 30 July 2013, and the legal substance of contracts usually takes precedence under Lux GAAP as opposed to economic substance under IFRS, similar to accounting principles in France. Similarly, legal rules applicable to companies in Luxembourg also affect accounting, especially the Law of 10 August 1915 as amended, which constitutes the main law for commercial companies. For instance, article 49 of the 1915 Law contains strict rules concerning the purchase of own shares, which translate into a specific accounting treatment whereby the own shares must be neutralised and allocated to a specific reserve.|$|E

Further, possible variations of issue of shares in the limited liability company such as issue of different classes of shares and the option of ownership of multiple shares in one company are examined.

Advantages and disadvantages have been discussed, as well as if own shares is profitable for all parties. Standard setters and auditors have also been interviewed about this issue. Through an analysis of the theoretical and empirical findings we presented how own shares shall be accounted for in Sweden. We further discovered that the Swedish regulation is somewhat too detailed within certain areas, which makes transactions with own shares somewhat more complicated than necessary. Even though the legislator did not consider protection for the minority, we have found a connection between own shares and this protection. We have analysed the cost-, par value- and EC-method and studied positive and negative features compared to the Swedish regulation of accounting.

30|$|The key {{characteristic}} of the LCA is the possibility, but not the requirement, of investor ownership (Dean and Geu 2008). Investors may obtain ownership by purchasing common stock, preferred stock, or some other <b>equity</b> <b>instrument.</b> By comparison, patron ownership is manifested by the right and obligation to supply or deliver a given commodity such as corn or chicken. Similar to NGCs, member patrons may face substantial supply and non-redeemable equity requirements to facilitate scale economies in processing. As two distinct types of owners, member patrons and member investors receive a return on patronage and investment, respectively. However, the ULCAA contains an allocation constraint, which states member patrons must be allocated at least 50 % of the profits and losses to preserve the cooperative nature of the entity. Thus, the ULCAA departs from other cooperative state law innovations in Wyoming, Minnesota, Iowa, and Tennessee, where the percentage of profits and losses allocated to member patrons may decrease to 15 %, as well as Wisconsin, which set the floor at 30 % (Geu and Dean 2009 b).|$|E
40|$|Accounting for {{financial}} instruments {{has been the most}} controversial area {{in the development of the}} IASB’s standards. The FASB and the IASB are currently working together towards a comprehensive standard of accounting {{for financial}} instruments with characteristics of equity, liability, or both. The main problem is how to distinguish liabilities from equity. According to the FASB, a new standard is necessary because current accounting literature addressing this issue is inconsistent, subject to structuring and difficult to understand and apply. This paper examines the current situation in classifying preferred stocks. A detailed comparison of common and preferred stocks, and debt securities and preferred stocks is then presented. Three theories of equity (proprietary theory, entity theory and residual equity theory) are described and compared, and the legal and economics approach to determining the difference between liabilities and equity are discussed.

40|$|Almost {{everyone}} agrees that equity-based incentive compensation {{can play an important}} role in increasing shareholder value, but there is considerable disagreement as to what that role should be and how equity pay should be packaged. What's more, there has been a backlash against equity pay that has compensation committees, investors, and corporate watchdogs on full alert. The authors of this article provide some basic guidelines for equity pay that could help to restore confidence in this useful element of compensation-guidelines that encompass the type of <b>equity</b> <b>instrument,</b> the level of equity-based pay, the extent to which equity pay is performance based, and the structure of the equity package in terms of vesting, exercise, and expiry. They start by acknowledging that the role of equity pay is limited by the extent to which shareholder value can be affected by the manager in question. They recommend building steadily to a constant level of stock price exposure and then gradually reducing this level after retirement. For most companies, equity-based pay should be significant only for a handful of employees; performance based cash bonuses provide better "line-of-sight," especially for operating managers who are somewhat removed from corporate-wide decisions. And disclosure-both internal and external-is perhaps the most important aspect of equity-based pay plans. 2004 Morgan Stanley. ...|$|E

As such the study only focuses on the development and validation of an instrument to measure brand equity of CSR driven organizations.

Paragraph 6. 1 of Accounting Standards AASB 1015 and AAS 21 “Acquisitions of Assets ” requires an acquisition {{to be measured}} at {{the cost to the}} acquiring entity.

40|$|The {{progressive}} attempt {{and implementation}} of direct payment limitations since the 1992 CAP reform has developed a “modulation mechanism” aiming to transfer funds from market support and direct payment schemes (CAP first pillar) towards rural development measures (CAP second pillar). Under the 2007 - 2013 European financial perspectives, the annual 5 % rate of modulation is expected to increase. The paper focuses on the financial impacts of four scenarios together with corresponding political and institutional feasibilities. The paper imposes on itself three sound constraints: (i) expanding modulation should not jeopardise the future in-depth reform of the direct payment regime, (ii) modulation should be compulsory and consistent with rural development financial needs, and (iii) present direct payment per farm should not be capped or subject to complex and differentiated reduction rates. Then, the paper suggests adopting a dynamic and uniform modulation rate to be increased by 1 percent per year from 2009 and then by 2 percent during the final step reaching 10 percent in 2012 (2013 financial year). It would deliver certainty to farmers and contribute to an efficient use in European spending, with {{no need for a}} controversial <b>equity</b> <b>instrument.</b> Direct payment reductions raise subsidiarity and budgetary issues which should be discussed within the European budget review. Considering the modulation mechanism as a related past-policy tool, renewed European decision making process and actors should outline from 2009 a new paradigm in direct payment regime.

Each of these changes is relevant to and impact on the consequences flowing from executive share incentive schemes, {{from the perspective of}} both the employer company offering the scheme and the employee participating in the scheme. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse, from the employer company’s perspective, the implications of each discipline in isolation, as well as the interrelationship of the three disciplines. The further aims of this study were to utilise the findings from the analyses to identify where legislative amendment is required to close loopholes or ensure equitable results, to identify where the interrelationship of the three disciplines result in unintended consequences, and to provide recommendations on how to avoid these adverse consequences. The most significant findings of this study are summarised below. Due to the legal precedent created by the Supreme Court of Appeal in the Labat case, the mode of settlement – cash or equity – will be the determining factor as regards the availability of an income tax deduction in the hands of the employer company. It is submitted that legislative amendment is required to rectify this inequitable result. Where payment by the employer pursuant to a share appreciation rights scheme occurs in a year of assessment subsequent to the year of assessment in which vesting occurred, changes in the value of the underlying <b>equity</b> <b>instrument</b> from the vesting date to the payment date could result in adverse income tax consequences to the employer and/or the fiscus. To address this, it is recommended that the Income Tax Act should be amended to expressly bring cash-settled executive share incentive schemes within the scope of s 7 B and to align the provisions of s 7 B and 8 C in order to avoid anomalies existing between these two sections in so far as the income tax consequences in the hands of the participating employees are concerne...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{arguments}} for and against the Financial Accounting Standard Board 2 ̆ 7 s (FASB) proposal to require that corporations expense options. It identifies two major goals of the proposed rule [...] 1) clarity in financial statements and 2) a reduction of corporate fraud by removing the incentive of options. To address these two goals, I adopt a framework of Information Reforms v. Rules of the Game Reforms. The article starts {{with a history of}} FASB Statement No. 123 Accounting for Stock-based Compensation and also analyzes the Congressional legislation that attempts to block the measure, the Stock Option Accounting Reform Act. I review the opinions of leading economists on the accuracy of the option valuation schemes advocated by the FASB and conclude that the models are too easily manipulated to advance the FASB goals of clarity in accounting. I conclude that neither the FASB proposed rule nor the Congressional legislation advances the goal of clarity in financial statements. The article suggests alternative measures that would better serve the interests of investors. I argue that a more accurate solution to the expense problem would be to adopt the IRS method for valuing stock options [...] intrinsic value at date of exercise. This accounting method tracks the cash flow out of the corporation since it reflects either an actual repurchase of shares issued by the company or a lost opportunity cost. In addition, I propose that corporations be required to only use fully diluted, in-the-money capitalization when computing EPS. This measure would address the FASB 2 ̆ 7 s concerns that the employee is given a valuable <b>equity</b> <b>instrument</b> at date of grant without there being a reflection in the company 2 ̆ 7 s financials. Finally, I review the literature that analyzes the impact of the FASB proposal on companies and the economy as a whole. The data shows that the FASB measure will not result in a reduction of corporate accounting fraud and the measure will result in a loss of productivity among American firms that use options to incentivize workers. I argue that the FASB proposed rule should be considered independent of considerations such as a reduction in fraud. The measure should solely be considered as an Information Reform, which by its nature is meant to improve the clarity of information rather than modify behavior. Modifying the behavior of executives who commit fraud or boards of directors who make large option grants requires more fundamental Rules of the Game Reforms rather than Information Reforms. Typical Rules of the Game Reforms would shift the power from management and the Board of Directors to shareholders and might include restrictions on the sale of executive stock so as to better align the interests of shareholders and employees...|$|E
