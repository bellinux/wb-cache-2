40|$|After intrastate armed conflict, what {{properties}} of <b>interim</b> <b>governments</b> increase {{the stability of}} post-interim peace? Previous research on <b>interim</b> <b>governments</b> has often relied on evidence gathered through under-theorized and non-comparative case studies, making findings difficult to generalize. The literature also tends to concentrate on studying the institutional designs of <b>interim</b> <b>governments</b> as explanatory variables, while neglecting the variety of reforms such governments implement. To address these shortcomings, this dissertation develops a bargaining model on how <b>interim</b> <b>governments</b> increase the stability of post-interim peace by mitigating credible commitment problems of warring parties. This bargaining model theorizes that both the institutional designs of <b>interim</b> <b>governments</b> – {{whether or not they}} include power-sharing arrangements for the warring parties, as well as whether or not international actors assume political authority during interim rule – as well as their reform processes affect the stability of post-interim peace. It argues for two reform processes in particular. First, it holds that <b>interim</b> <b>governments</b> that implement reforms to integrate the parallel political and military institutions of warring parties (such as shadow governments and non-statutory armed forces) should increase the stability of peace. Second, it argues that <b>interim</b> <b>governments</b> that allow for the participation of unarmed actors in reform processes – such as civil society representatives – should increase the stability of post-interim peace. The dissertation tests these hypotheses by using a mixed-method research design that combines statistical survival analysis with process-tracing in and a comparative analysis of three case studies. In the quantitative analysis, it relies on a novel data set of a sample of all <b>interim</b> <b>governments</b> that followed at least one year of intrastate armed conflict since 1989, and that terminated by 2012. The qualitative case studies, selected under a most-similar system design, include the <b>interim</b> <b>governments</b> of Nepal (2006 - 2008), Angola (1991 - 1992), and Cambodia (1991 - 1993). In sum, results from both quantitative and qualitative analyses show that the reforms implemented by <b>interim</b> <b>governments</b> provide for a better explanation for long-term peace as compared to the institutional designs of such governments. In particular, the dissertation finds strongest support for hypothesis H 3 on the integration of parallel political and military institutions into the authority of <b>interim</b> <b>governments.</b> The dissertation concludes by discussing policy implications and avenues for future research...|$|R

5|$|On 7 April, as the {{genocide}} started, RPF commander Paul Kagame warned the <b>interim</b> <b>government</b> and UNAMIR {{that he would}} resume the civil war if the killing did not stop. The next day FAR forces attacked the national parliament building from several directions, but RPF troops stationed there successfully fought back. The RPF then began an attack from the north on three fronts, seeking to link up quickly with the isolated troops in Kigali. Kagame {{refused to talk to}} the <b>interim</b> <b>government,</b> believing that it was just a cover for Bagosora's rule, and not committed to ending {{the genocide}}. Over the next few days, the RPF advanced steadily south, capturing Gabiro and large areas of the countryside to the north and east of Kigali. They avoided attacking Kigali or Byumba, but conducted manoeuvres designed to encircle the cities and cut off supply routes. The RPF also allowed Tutsi refugees from Uganda to settle behind the front line in the RPF controlled areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{shooting}} {{down of the}} plane served as the catalyst for the Rwandan genocide, which began within a few hours. An <b>interim</b> <b>government</b> took over, headed by de facto-leader Colonel Théoneste Bagosora, which began ordering the systematic killing of huge numbers of Tutsi, {{as well as some}} politically moderate Hutu, through well-planned attacks. Over the course of approximately 100 days, between 500,000 and 1,000,000 were killed.|$|E
5|$|Throughout April {{there were}} {{numerous}} attempts by UNAMIR to establish a ceasefire, but Kagame insisted each time that the RPF would not stop fighting unless the killings stopped. In late April, the RPF secured {{the whole of the}} Tanzanian border area and began to move west from Kibungo, to the south of Kigali. They encountered little resistance, except around Kigali and Ruhengeri. By 16 May they had cut the road between Kigali and Gitarama, the temporary home of the <b>interim</b> <b>government,</b> and by 13 June, had taken Gitarama itself. The taking of Gitarama followed an unsuccessful attempt by the FAR forces to reopen the road. The <b>interim</b> <b>government</b> was forced to relocate to Gisenyi in the far northwest. As well as fighting the war, Kagame recruited heavily at this time to expand the RPF. The new recruits included Tutsi survivors of the genocide and refugees from Burundi, but they were less well trained and disciplined than the earlier recruits.|$|E

The CPP came in second place and secured 38.23% of valid votes, and were unhappy with {{the outcome of the}} elections. On 3 June 1993, CPP leaders Chea Sim and Hun Sen met with Sihanouk to propose that he should lead a new <b>interim</b> <b>government,</b> and also demanding power-sharing for the CPP with FUNCINPEC on a fifty-fifty basis. Sihanouk agreed to the CPP's proposal and announced the formation of an <b>interim</b> <b>government</b> that evening. Ranariddh and other FUNCINPEC leaders were not consulted over Sihanouk's proposal, and the announcement caught them by surprise. Ranariddh sent a fax to his father to disapprove of the CPP's proposal, and the United States expressed a similar stance. Sihanouk publicly rescinded his earlier announcement of the interim government's formation the following day.|$|E

They met again on 26 February the day before polling began in the Common Roll election. The consensus at this meeting was that Abel Muzorewa's <b>interim</b> <b>government</b> would win enough seats, when put together with the 20 seats reserved for whites which were all Rhodesian Front, to deny Mugabe victory. However, the early election results in March dented this confidence.|$|E

His role was only temporary, until power was to be ceded back to civilians in six months time. Among the events on the official timetable, which the military published on January 17, 1968, was the creation of a nonmilitary Constitution Commission on January 31, which would write a new Dahomeyan constitution. The document granted Alley strong executive power, and was adopted by the Comite Militaire Revolutionaire, Alley's <b>interim</b> <b>government</b> comprisising only military officers, in early March. A national referendum on the constitution was held on March 31, which passed with 92 percent in favor.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the war had}} officially ended, a {{state of}} anarchy and {{lawlessness}} pervaded {{in the first days}} following the demise of Vitellius. Order was properly restored by Mucianus in early 70, who headed an <b>interim</b> <b>government</b> with Domitian as the representative of the Flavian family in the Senate. Upon receiving the tidings of his rival's defeat and death at Alexandria, the new Emperor at once forwarded supplies of urgently needed grain to Rome, along with an edict or a declaration of policy, in which he gave assurance of an entire reversal of the laws of Nero, especially those relating to treason. In early 70, Vespasian was still in Egypt however, continuing to consolidate support from the Egyptians before departing. By the end 70, he finally returned to Rome, and was properly installed as Emperor.|$|E
5|$|Babangida survived an {{abortive}} coup, then postponed a promised {{return to}} democracy to 1992.

However, Babangida annulled the elections, leading to massive civilian protests that effectively shut down the country for weeks. Babangida finally kept his promise to relinquish office to a civilian government, but not before appointing Ernest Shonekan head of an <b>interim</b> <b>government.</b> Babangida's regime has been considered the most corrupt, and responsible for creating a culture of corruption in Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|Both second-round {{candidates}} and the incumbent president were initially {{arrested by the}} junta. Members of the Military Council, which ran the country until an interim National Transitional Council was established on 15 April, {{said that one of}} the reasons for the coup was the incumbent civilian administration's call for Angolan help to reform the military. Following international condemnation and sanctions against leaders of the junta, an agreement was signed that led to the third place candidate in the election, Manuel Serifo Nhamadjo, being selected as interim president. The presidential election was aborted and postponed for at least two years into the future. An <b>interim</b> <b>government</b> is tasked with administering Guinea-Bissau in the meantime.|$|E
50|$|In May 1875, July 1875 and 1881 King Oscar II (whom Haffner had {{formerly}} tutored) appointed Haffner {{an acting}} {{member of the}} <b>interim</b> <b>governments</b> in Stockholm. Such <b>interim</b> <b>governments</b> were established when the King travelled abroad. On 21 March 1884, when Selmer's Cabinet fell due to the impeachment trial, Haffner was again named {{a member of the}} Council of State Division in Stockholm. He was also appointed acting Prime Minister in Stockholm, as the previous Prime Minister in Stockholm, Otto Richard Kierulf, went down in the Selmer impeachment case. Over Haffner, two people served as acting Prime Ministers in Kristiania: Ole Bachke from 11 to 29 March and Niels Mathias Rye from 29 March to 3 April 1884. On 3 April a new cabinet, Schweigaard's Cabinet, was finally constituted, and Haffner was relieved of both his positions.

The accords called for a Palestinian police force to be formed from local recruits and Palestinians abroad, to patrol areas of self-rule. Authority over the various fields of rule, including education and culture, social welfare, direct taxation and tourism, would be transferred to the Palestinian <b>interim</b> <b>government.</b> Both parties agreed also on forming a committee that would establish cooperation and coordination dealing with specific economic sectors, including utilities, industry, trade and communication.|$|E

The chaos in Punjab resulting from Partition had also severed transport links with India, meaning that Kashmir's only links with the two dominions was by air.

Shortly thereafter, Pathan tribesmen from the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan crossed the border and entered Kashmir. The invaders made rapid progress towards Srinagar. The Maharaja of Kashmir wrote to India, asking for military assistance. India required the signing of an Instrument of Accession and setting up an <b>interim</b> <b>government</b> headed by Sheikh Abdullah in return.
