5|$|Jenni is {{disturbed}} both by Mickey's {{belief that}} Marion's ghost wanders the estate and by Marion's self-portrait inside the house, which Jenni believes resembles her mother. When {{she begins to}} hear unexplained screaming noises and see skulls around her house, she believes that Marion is haunting her. Though Eric speculates to Jenni that Mickey, who was a childhood friend of Marion and thus dislikes Jenni, may be behind the trickery, Jenni worries that she is going insane. Eric suggests to remove Marion's self-portrait from the home. Eric and Jenni take the painting outside and burn it. While they clean up {{the remains of the}} painting, a skull emerges from the ashes. Jenni panics {{at the sight of the}} skull, but Eric denies that the skull is there. Jenni faints and Eric withdraws the skull and hides it, revealing that he has been <b>gaslighting</b> her all along.|$|E
5|$|Nineteenth-century {{interiors}} could {{often be}} lavish and eclectic. The origins of this style were in Scott's Abbotsford, where the author began {{the incorporation of}} actual old architectural fragments and pieces of furniture on a lavish scale (the effective beginning of 'antique' collecting in Scotland). He also initiated the treatment of new surfaces so as to resemble old ones, with new wood darkened to resemble old oak. The Adam solution of a castellated exterior with a neo-classical interior was abandoned and in Baronial revival houses this change was extended to create a synthesised Victorian style that combined elements of the Renaissance, such as plastered or rubble walls, unpainted stone fireplaces and pitch pine timberwork, with seventeenth-century style plaster ceilings. To this were added symbols of landed power and national affiliation, including displays of tartan, weaponry and stuffed animals' heads. Integrated into these traditional materials and styles were modern fittings such as sprung upholstery, <b>gaslighting</b> and water-closets.|$|E

The housekeeper Estella Munoz (Anne Betancourt) is blamed and arrested; however, Adam was secretly <b>gaslighting</b> Ashley. Adam dresses as Sabrina, scares Ashley and she falls down a staircase, {{causing her to}} miscarry her child, whose father is Victor. Adam then blackmails her doctor, Charles Taylor, into telling her that her child was still alive. Rafe Torres (Yani Gellman) is appointed to investigate Adam, who seduces him to divert his attention from Adam's criminal activity. Heather discovers Adam's affair with Rafe and ends her relationship with Adam. Ashley is admitted to a psychiatric hospital, where a pregnant Sharon Newman (Sharon Case) is also staying. Sharon goes into labor and Adam steals her daughter, Faith, and passes her off as Ashley’s child. Sharon believes her child had died, and guilt-ridden, Adam pursues a relationship with Sharon and they elope, but she leaves him when she remembers elements that contradict her losing her child. A note from a dying Charles Taylor saying that Ashley had miscarried and Faith is really Sharon and Nicholas’ daughter is found. Adam is jailed again, but gets the insane Patty Williams (Stacy Haiduk) to help him escape to attend a masquerade ball, where he unsuccessfully begs Sharon for forgiveness. An explosion at the ball occurs and a burned corpse is positively identified as Adam. Nicholas is arrested for Adam's murder. The corpse is actually that of Richard Hightower, to whom Adam had donated bone marrow and carries Adam's DNA. Adam meets up with Skye Lockhart (Laura Stone) and they plot a confidence trick together, but Adam still dreams of Sharon.|$|E

40|$|Tony Terry founded The <b>Gaslight</b> Theatre in Tucson, Arizona, in 1977. The thesis {{examines}} The <b>Gaslight</b> Theatre {{in order}} to validate the company's artistic relevancy as a contemporary producer of melodramas and to further understand the reason behind the theatre's current success. The structure of the work begins {{with a history of}} melodrama, a look at the producer, Tony Terry, and his background and influence on The <b>Gaslight</b> Theatre, followed by a history of The <b>Gaslight's</b> three phases: The Victorian melodramas, the musical comedy melodramas, and the comedy spoof melodramas. A history of The <b>Gaslight</b> olio reveals the nature of the art form. The thesis further provides a study of those involved in the theatre's success, as well as the company's inevitable link to the current theatre practices. Most importantly, the thesis examines The <b>Gaslight</b> Theatre's significance to the local and American theatre community...|$|R

25|$|<b>Gaslighting</b> is {{manipulation}} through persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, {{and lying}} {{in an attempt}} to destabilize and delegitimize a target. Its intent is to sow seeds of doubt in the targets, hoping to make them question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Instances may range from the denial by an abuser that previous abusive incidents ever occurred up to the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention of disorienting the victim. The term owes its origin to Gas Light, a 1938 play and 1944 film, and has been used in clinical and research literature.|$|E

50|$|Brothers Dick and Paul Mutrux are {{considered}} by many to be the pioneers of <b>Gaslight</b> Square, being proprietors of one of the first saloons in the area, the <b>Gaslight.</b> Another saloon, the Golden Eagle, soon opened, and proprietor Jay Landesman relocated his extremely popular cabaret theatre, the Crystal Palace, to the area as well. Early business owners in <b>Gaslight</b> Square raided recently demolished property in downtown St. Louis to salvage unique items such as church pews, chandeliers, recycled stained glass, and marble bathtubs. These resourceful decorations gave <b>Gaslight</b> Square a youthful, eclectic feel that attracted young beatniks and wealthy customers alike. At its height, <b>Gaslight</b> Square was home to approximately fifty businesses, including taverns, cabarets, restaurants, sidewalk cafes, and antique shops. These businesses provided an array of unique entertainment that combined elements of the past and present. The Opera House had a façade covered in croquet balls and was a venue for Dixieland jazz. The Roaring Twenties was a speakeasy themed bar that included a stage show, mock raids, and staged gangster fights. The Natchez Queen was decorated to resemble a riverboat with live ragtime music inside. Mr.D's, highlighted a Piano Bar featuring Ceil Clayton where many of the <b>Gaslight</b> musicians would come and sing along. By 1962, property values had tripled in <b>Gaslight</b> Square.|$|R

50|$|Live at The <b>Gaslight</b> 1962 was {{recorded}} early in Dylans career, {{when he was}} still virtually unknown outside of Greenwich Village. Thanks to the cooperation of various club owners, and the management skills of Dave Van Ronks wife, Terri Thal, Dylan was able to record a number of performances during that time on a reel-to-reel tape recorder patched into the house PA system. It is believed that Live at The <b>Gaslight</b> 1962 was culled from tapes recorded with this arrangement. But in 2016, during a video interview promoting the release of Dylans Live 1966 box, sound engineer Richard Alderson, who had built the <b>Gaslights</b> sound system and would later handle the sound for Dylans 1966 tour, claimed {{he was the one who}} recorded the <b>Gaslight</b> performances at the request of the <b>Gaslights</b> owners during an after hours show.|$|R

5000|$|In an {{influential}} 1981 article, Some Clinical Consequences of Introjection: <b>Gaslighting,</b> Calef and Weinshel argue that <b>gaslighting</b> involves the projection and introjection of psychic conflicts from the perpetrator to the victim: [...] "this imposition {{is based on}} a very special kind of 'transfer'... of painful and potentially painful mental conflicts." [...] The authors explore a variety of reasons why the victims may have [...] "a tendency to incorporate and assimilate what others externalize and project onto them", and conclude that <b>gaslighting</b> may be [...] "a very complex highly structured configuration which encompasses contributions from many elements of the psychic apparatus." [...] Dorpat (1994) describes this as an example of projective identification.|$|E
50|$|The {{psychological}} term <b>gaslighting,</b> {{which describes}} {{a form of}} psychological abuse in which the victim is gradually manipulated into doubting {{his or her own}} reality, originated from the play and its two film adaptations. <b>Gaslighting,</b> today, mostly refers to one of the methods of abuse used by a narcissist to emotionally control a victim, through which the narcissist gains pleasure.|$|E
5000|$|To say <b>gaslighting</b> {{was started}} by the Bushes, Lee Atwater, Karl Rove, Fox news, or any other extant or group is not simply wrong, it also misses an {{important}} point. <b>Gaslighting</b> comes directly from blending modern communications, marketing, and advertising techniques with long-standing methods of propaganda.
