500|$|The {{changes were}} met with controversy, with critics arguing that the new chart failed {{to take into account}} R and rap music's {{traditionally}} African-American demographic.

Well, {{this is only a}} week and a half after the Belmont, and believe me when <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> if I don't run this horse he's going to hurt himself in his stall.
