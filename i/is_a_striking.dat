5|$|Mimesis is practised by {{animals such as}} {{the leafy}} sea dragon, Phycodurus eques, and the leaf scorpionfish, Taenianotus triacanthus, which {{resemble}} parts of plants, and gently rock their bodies as if swayed by a current. In the fish species Novaculichthys taeniourus, the rockmover or dragon wrasse, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> difference in appearance between the adults and the juveniles. A juvenile Rockmover resembles a loose piece of sea weed. It swims in a vertical position with its head pointing downwards, and behaves {{in a way that}} perfectly resembles the movement of a piece of seaweed: moving {{back and forth in the}} surge, as if it was inanimate.|$|E
5|$|The Hotel Valley Ho <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> {{example of}} the mid-century modern {{architectural}} style. Varney's use of masonry, cast and poured concrete, natural stone, and wide expanses of glass make for a close connection between the building and its environment. Stone floor and wall patterns link the exterior entry and the lobby, as does {{the extension of the}} redwood ceiling. The hotel is now considered one of the finest examples of organic architecture. Rooms in the two adjacent wings added in the late 1950s are unusual, and remarkably forward-thinking even by mid-century design standards, for their high nine-foot-ceilings. The prevailing trend at the time of original construction was low-ceilinged rooms, in some cases with ceilings only seven feet above ground level, but the Valley Ho's rooms feel exceptionally roomy and airy thanks to its original decision to buck design trends.|$|E
25|$|St. Catherine's Church: built 1360–1365, High Gothic {{church in}} the heart of the town with a {{coppersmith}} altar; the high tower with its spire <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> landmark in the town centre. Its carillon sounds at 11 am and 5 pm.|$|E
50|$|The Chicago Newspaper <b>strike</b> of 1912 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strike</b> {{that ran}} from May until November. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>strike</b> that <b>was</b> {{primarily}} {{held by the}} pressmen and was supported by other unions such as the stereotypers. The pressmen union attempted to bring attention to conglomerate newspaper publishers attempts to breaking up printing unions.|$|R

25|$|Threlkeld Knotts (meaning: the knobbly hill above Threlkeld) is a lower, rounded hill, {{nestling}} {{against and}} {{overshadowed by the}} steep northern face of Clough Head. Its curving summit ridge contains three small tops, {{each of which is}} marked by a cairn. From Threlkeld Knotts there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> view of Red Screes just above, and a narrow path slants up through the crags to the west shoulder of Clough Head.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} is constructed using reinforced concrete, filled in internally with bricks and plaster, and clad {{on the outside}} with granite. At first sight, the building <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> example of the Art Deco style {{and many of its}} features epitomize this genre - however, some interior features deviate from true Art Deco and probably reflect the desire of the company to demonstrate solidity and traditional values {{at the same time as}} contemporaneous, forward-looking values.|$|E

25|$|The name of Maodun {{has been}} {{associated}} with Oghuz Khagan, an epic ancestor of the Turkic people. The reason for that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> similarity of the Oghuz Khagan biography in the Turko manuscripts (Rashid al-Din, Hondemir, Abulgazi) with the Maodun biography in the Chinese sources (feud between the father and son and murder of the former, the direction and sequence of conquests, etc.), which was first noticed by N.Ya. Bichurin (Compilation of reports, pp.56–57).|$|E
25|$|The {{seeds of}} other poppy types are not eaten, {{but they are}} {{cultivated}} for the flowers they produce. Annual and biennial poppies are considered a good choice to cultivate from seed as they are not difficult to propagate by this method, and can be put directly in the ground during January. The California poppy (Eschscholzia californica), for example, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> orange wildflower that grows in the Western and Northwestern United States.|$|E
25|$|The Eram Garden (Bagh-e Eram) in Shiraz <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> {{location}} for visitors {{with a variety}} of plants as well as a historic mansion. Although the exact date of the construction of the garden is not clear, historical evidence suggests it was constructed during the Seljuk Dynasty on the orders of the celebrated Seljuk monarch Sanjar. Other historical Persian gardens are Afifabad Garden and The Museum of Weapons, Delgosha Garden and Jahan Nama Garden.|$|E

Sport Karate emphasizes aerobic exercise, anaerobic exercise, power, agility, flexibility, and stress management. All practices vary depending upon {{the school and the}} teacher.|$|E
25|$|The Buried Moon or The Dead Moon is a {{fairy tale}} {{included}} by Joseph Jacobs in More English Fairy Tales. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> unusual tale, with few variants, and often appearing more mythological than is common for fairy tales. It was collected by Mrs. Balfour from the North Lincolnshire Carrs in the Ancholme Valley; its unusual characteristics made many people doubt its origins as {{a fairy tale}}. However, when Mrs. Balfour published her notes, they were generally found reliable, and the Fens proved to have many other unusual legends. The story may be evidence of moon worship.|$|E
25|$|Fleetwith Pike is the {{north-western}} {{shoulder of}} Grey Knotts. It is bounded by Honister Pass {{to the north}} and Warnscale Bottom to the south-west, their two streams uniting beneath the fell in Buttermere. The north west ridge rising almost from the lakeshore at Gatesgarth is named Fleetwith Edge, and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> feature from any direction. The top of the fell is situated directly {{at the top of the}} edge, while a lower summit stands to the east atop Honister Crag. Fleetwith Pike is lined on all sides by impressive crags, other than for the broad plateau leading across the Drum House to Grey Knotts.|$|E

25|$|Notable {{examples}} of this movement appear in Maclaine Pont's design for the ceremonial halls of the Technische Hoogeschool te Bandung (which became Institut Teknologi Bandung). The building features an eclectic synthesis of various Indonesian local forms, including the architecture of Lake Toba, the Mentawai islands, and Sunda. The building <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> example of innovative tropical architecture. With an elongated elevation aligned on an east-west axis, the building is provided with effective natural ventilation. This orientation also minimizes the effect of solar radiation in that the morning and afternoon sun only strikes the narrow end facades of the building. The external galleries of the building create a double facade which shield the interior from direct sunlight, while cooling towers at either end ensure good ventilation.|$|E
25|$|Poverty Point, built about 1500 BC {{in what is}} now Louisiana, is a {{prominent}} example of Late Archaic mound-builder construction (c. 2500 BCE - 1000 BCE). It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> complex of more than one square mile, where six earthwork crescent ridges were built in concentric arrangement, interrupted by radial aisles. Three mounds are also part of the main complex, and evidence of residences extends for about 3 miles along the bank of Bayou Macon. It is the major site among 100 associated with the Poverty Point culture {{and is one of the}} best-known early examples of earthwork monumental architecture. Unlike the localized societies during the Middle Archaic, this culture showed evidence of a wide trading network outside its area, which is one of its distinguishing characteristics.|$|E
25|$|Her most studied work, The Morgesons {{is set in}} a small seaport town, and is the {{dramatic}} story of Cassandra Morgeson's fight against social and religious norms in a quest for sexual, spiritual, and economic autonomy. An indomitable heroine, Cassandra not only achieves an equal and complete love with her husband and ownership of her family's property, but also masters the skills and accomplishments expected of women. Counterpointed with the stultified lives of her aunt, mother, and sister, Cassandra's success <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> and radical affirmation of women's power to shape their own destinies. Embodying the convergence of the melodrama and sexual undercurrents of gothic romance and Victorian social realism, The Morgesons marks an important transition {{in the development of the}} novel and evoked comparisons during Stoddard's lifetime with such masters as Honoré de Balzac, Leo Tolstoy, George Eliot, the Brontë sisters, and Nathaniel Hawthorne.|$|E

500|$|... (published in 1742 by the Italian {{physician}} and malacologist Niccolò Gualtieri) contains three illustrations of adult shells from different perspectives. The knobbed spire and the flaring outer lip, with its somewhat wing-like contour expanding {{out from the}} last whorl, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> feature of these images. The shells are shown as if balancing {{on the edge of}} the lip and/or the apex; this was presumably done for artistic reasons as these shells cannot balance like this.|$|E
500|$|The coins were officially {{released}} to circulation on March 4, 1913, and quickly gained positive comments as depicting truly American themes. [...] However, The New York Times stated {{in an editorial}} that [...] "The new 'nickel' <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> example of what a coin intended for wide circulation should not be... is not pleasing to look at when new and shiny, and will be an abomination when old and dull." [...] The Numismatist, in March and May 1913 editorials, gave the new coin a lukewarm review, suggesting that the Indian's head be reduced in size and the bison be eliminated from the reverse.|$|E
500|$|After the Mexican army lays siege to the mission, Lieutenant Dickenson departs with a {{dispatch}} to General Sam Houston. Senor Navarre makes sexual advances on Dickenson's wife, Lucy, who is saved by Colonel William B. Travis. Navarre is ousted from {{the mission and}} provides information on the Alamo to General Antonio López de Santa Anna {{so that he can}} marry Lucy Dickenson. Lieutenant Dickenson returns with reinforcements before the wedding and kills Senor Navarre. The final scene of the film shows Santa Anna surrendering as a [...] "common soldier". The film has been noted as historically inaccurate in its plot, but that it tries for accuracy in its setting. Reviews of the film were mixed and C. H. Claudy's criticism of the film <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> contemporary account of the film's depiction. No known copies of the film exist today, and it {{is considered to be a}} lost film.|$|E
