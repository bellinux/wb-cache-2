5|$|Bivalves {{appear in}} the fossil record first in the early Cambrian more than 500 million years ago. The total number of living species is about 9,200. These species are placed within 1,260 genera and 106 families. Marine {{bivalves}} (including brackish water and <b>estuarine</b> <b>species)</b> represent about 8,000 species, combined in four subclasses and 99 families with 1,100 genera. The largest recent marine families are the Veneridae, with more than 680 species and the Tellinidae and Lucinidae, each with over 500 species. The freshwater bivalves include seven families, the largest of which are the Unionidae, with about 700 species.|$|E
25|$|The {{level of}} {{salinity}} {{can also be}} quite variable. Low salinities {{can be caused by}} rainwater or river inputs of freshwater. <b>Estuarine</b> <b>species</b> must be especially euryhaline, or able to tolerate a wide range of salinities. High salinities occur in locations with high evaporation rates, such as in salt marshes and high intertidal pools. Shading by plants, especially in the salt marsh, can slow evaporation and thus ameliorate salinity stress. In addition, salt marsh plants tolerate high salinities by several physiological mechanisms, including excreting salt through salt glands and preventing salt uptake into the roots.|$|E
500|$|The Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) is {{cultivated}} {{by similar}} methods but in larger volumes {{and in many}} more regions of the world. This oyster originated in Japan {{where it has been}} cultivated for many centuries. It is an <b>estuarine</b> <b>species</b> and prefers salinities of 20 to 25 parts per thousand. Breeding programmes have produced improved stock that is available from hatcheries. A single female oyster can produce 50–80 million eggs in a batch so the selection of broodstock is of great importance. The larvae are grown on in tanks of static or moving water. They are fed high quality microalgae and diatoms and grow fast. At metamorphosis the juveniles may be allowed to settle on PVC sheets or pipes, or crushed shell. In some cases, they continue their development in [...] "upwelling culture" [...] in large tanks of moving water rather than being allowed to settle on the bottom. They then may be transferred to transitional, nursery beds before being moved to their final rearing quarters. Culture there takes place on the bottom, in plastic trays, in mesh bags, on rafts or on long lines, either in shallow water or in the intertidal zone. The oysters are ready for harvesting in 18 to 30 months depending on the size required.|$|E
40|$|Fourteen {{species of}} subtidal macrobenthos present in {{thirteen}} Eastern Cape estuaries, South Africa, {{were compared with}} regard to correlations with two important environmental variables (salinity and sediment mud content). Species were divided into five different faunal components based on their affinity {{with one of the}} two variables, namely marine <b>species,</b> oligohaline <b>species,</b> <b>estuarine</b> sand <b>species,</b> <b>estuarine</b> mud <b>species,</b> and species whose distribution seemed independent of either environmental variable. Although most species exhibited wide tolerance ranges to both environmental variables, preference ranges could be identified in many cases. Among the fourteen species studied, three were found mostly at high salinities, two were confined to sandy substratum, and four showed a clear preference for muddy sediment. The crab Paratylodiplax algoense was identified as a euryhaline marine species and the larvae of chironomid midges, previously believed to be oligohaline species, were found to be tolerant to near-seawater salinities.

40|$|Estuarine fish assemblages {{are subject}} to a great {{environmental}} variability that largely depends on both upstream fluvial and downstream marine influences. From this ecohydrological view, our study introduces a macroecological approach aiming to identify the main environmental factors that structure fish assemblages among European tidal estuaries. The present paper focuses {{on the influence of}} large scale environmental gradients on <b>estuarine</b> fish <b>species</b> richness. The environment of 135 North-eastern Atlantic estuaries from Portugal to Scotland was characterized by various descriptors especially related to hydromorphology. Major environmental trends among estuaries were underlined using multivariate techniques and cluster analyses applied to abiotic data. In particular, an integrative system size covariate was derived from a principal component analysis. Factors explaining patterns of species richness at different scales from local habitat to regional features were highlighted. Based on generalised linear models, the estuarine system size, and more particularly the entrance width, and also the continental shelf width were identified as the best explanatory variables of <b>estuarine</b> fish <b>species</b> richness at a large scale.

The increasing number of impact assessment studies, management and conservation plans, as well as ecological monitoring studies, demand new and more efficient techniques.

40|$|When the megalopa {{stage of}} <b>estuarine</b> crab <b>species</b> becomes {{competent}} for settlement and metamorphosis, it responds to specific chemical and physical cues from the adult environment. Delayed metamorphosis {{in the absence}} of such cues is beneficial insofar as it increases the probability of finding a suitable habitat, and it may also enhance the genetic exchange between separate populations. However, this developmental and behavioural response may incur energetic costs reducing the fitness of later life-history stages. In a laboratory investigation, we studied postmetamorphic consequences of delayed metamorphosis for growth and survival in early juvenile instars (I through V) of an estuarine grapsid crab, Chasmagnathus granulata (Dana, 1851). In competent megalopa larvae of this species, metamorphosis is induced by chemical cues from muddy substrates and conspecific adults (control treatment), After delayed metamorphosis {{in the absence of}} these cues (experimental treatment), survival and body size were significantly reduced in the first crab stage, and the duration of development to the second juvenile instar was significantly longer. Survival, moult-cycle duration, and percentage growth increments were not significantly affected in later juvenile instars. However, {{as a consequence of the}} initial reduction in development and growth, the crabs from the experimental treatment remained consistently smaller and moulted later to successive instars than in the control group. Our results indicate that delayed metamorphosis is associated with a reduced postmetamorphic fitness in an <b>estuarine</b> crab <b>species...</b>|$|R

40|$|The Wilderness Lakes System, a {{temporarily}} {{open and}} closed estuary with three associated lakes {{situated in the}} southern Cape region of South Africa, was sampled using a range of sampling gears to assess the fish community. A total of 25 species were sampled throughout the system, with the highest diversity in the Touw Estuary (23 species) and the lowest in Langvlei (11 species). Estuary-associated marine species (13 species) dominated species richness with smaller proportions of <b>estuarine</b> resident (7 <b>species),</b> freshwater (3 species) and catadromous <b>species</b> (2 <b>species).</b> <b>Estuarine</b> resident <b>species</b> dominated the catch numerically. The size–class distribution of euryhaline marine species indicated that upon entering the Touw Estuary as juveniles, the fish move up the system towards Rondevlei where they appear to remain. Three freshwater species were recorded in the system, {{all of which are}} alien to the Wilderness Lakes System. Decreasing salinity in the upper lakes appears to be a driving factor in the distribution and increasing abundance of the freshwater fishes. Sampling followed a drought, with the system experiencing substantially increased levels of mouth closure compared to a similar study conducted in the 1980 s. The timing of mouth opening and the degree of connectivity between the lakes influence the nursery function of the system as a whole. Management actions need to focus on improving ecological functioning of this system, in particular how mouth opening is managed, to facilitate nursery function and limit the establishment of invasive species. Conservation implications: Key management actions are required to improve fish recruitment potential into and within the system. These include maintenance of adequate marine inflow through adherence to artificial mouth breaching protocols and improving connectivity between the lakes through sediment removal from localised deposition points within the connecting channels. </p...|$|R

40|$|Coastal {{saltmarsh}} provides suitable breeding {{habitat for}} a number of <b>estuarine</b> mosquito <b>species.</b> The saltmarsh mosquito (Aedes vigilax Skuse) can be locally abundant throughout summer, representing a potentially important prey resource for insectivorous bat species. However, Ae. vigilax has been identified as an important vector of mosquito-borne viruses such as Ross River virus and Barmah Forest virus and is a known nuisance biting pest. Coastal residential areas adjacent to Empire Bay (e. g., Killcare, Pretty Beach and Hardys Bay) on the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia are prone to nuisance biting from Ae. vigilax and other <b>estuarine</b> mosquito <b>species,</b> particularly in late summer each year. Residents have requested use of a broadscale mosquito spraying regime (using Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis, Bti) to control numbers of Ae. vigilax. While {{it has been suggested that}} Ae. vigilax may be an important dietary item for insectivorous bats foraging within saltmarsh, no study to date has specifically investigated the importance of the mosquito in the diet of these bats. In this thesis, I investigated the importance of Ae. vigilax to insectivorous bats on the NSW Central Coast by examining relationships between bat activity, habitat use by bats, bat diet and the availability of Ae. vigilax and non-mosquito prey in three major habitats (saltmarsh, urban and forest) within the area. In all, 15 bat species and two species groups were recorded, of which eight are listed as threatened under the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act (1995). Bats were most active in forest habitat, however, proportional feeding activity was greatest in saltmarsh. Positive relationships between prey abundance and total bat activity were only detected in the less cluttered saltmarsh habitat...|$|R
