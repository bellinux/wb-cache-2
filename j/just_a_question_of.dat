The song follows a basic sequence of B9–B6/F–B9–B6/F as its chord progression.

Using entanglement swapping between two temporally separated photon pairs we entangle one photon from the first pair with another photon from the second pair.

40|$|Nowadays, as ageing {{increases}} in Western societies {{it has become}} more evident that multiple generations are ageing concurrently at any given time in history. Therefore, ageing must be approached as a multi-generational phenomenon, not <b>just</b> as <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> elders. In this context, situations that engender increased interactions between generations are garnering more attention. There is a growing emphasis on expanding the role of technology in intergenerational programmes, within the field of intergenerational studies. Consequently, this paper is focused on education and learning processes within intergenerational programmes with a strong technology component. Information from a total of 46 intergenerational programmes from 11 countries has been gathered through a survey. Level of impact, status of generational groups, and centrality of technology have been appraised for all programmes in the sample. Technology learning-teaching constitute the main area of intended impact of these programmes. However, the surveyed programmes employ as well a wide range of strategies to facilitate intergenerational communication, cooperation and relationship formation between generations involved. Interest of programmes examined does not just consist of teaching the use technology but of experimenting with technology in different forms and functions and exploring the positive potential for enhancing intergenerational relationship...|$|R

However, the advent of large financial crises {{as a result of}} their use raises issue as to the risks derivatives themselves might pose to the players who use them, as well as to the international financial system as a whole. It is, therefore, <b>a</b> key <b>question</b> to ask what regulation might be apt for trade in OTC derivatives. This thesis considers how a post-structuralist account might offer important insight into how this question is understood. Post-structuralist, as well as broader social constructivist and non-rationalist critiques help illustrate some of the limits to objectivist rationalism in practices of financial risk management. This thesis argues that the danger of ignoring such critiques include a continued “illusion” of individual and state-actor control over macro-economic processes, such as the phenomenal volume of trade in OTC derivatives contracts today. In this light, therefore, the regulation of OTC derivatives is not <b>just</b> <b>a</b> political <b>question</b> <b>of</b> who does and should have explicit policy control over economic and regulatory processes; but it is also <b>a</b> political <b>question</b> over knowledge constructs, and how particular technologies and specialist discourses are developed that enable “experts” legitimacy and power where it is not necessarily justified...|$|R

It has been adopted as a new benchmark by NGOs, but also main economic and public actors at different level of political governance, from local scenes to the global one.

The song was written by Henry Mancini, who had meant dollar signs for Williams with such previous movie themes as 'Moon River,' 'Days of Wine and Roses,' and 'Dear Heart.'

40|$|Calreticulin is {{a highly}} conserved {{multifunctional}} protein implicated in many different biological systems and has therefore {{been the subject of}} intensive research. It is primarily present in the endoplasmatic reticulum where its main functions are to regulate Ca 2 + homeostasis, act as a chaperone and stabilize the MHC class I peptide-loading complex. Although several high-resolution structures of calreticulin exist, these only cover three-quarters of the entire protein leaving the extended structures unsolved. Additionally, the structure of calreticulin is influenced by the presence of Ca 2 +. The conformational changes induced by Ca 2 + have not been determined yet as they are hard to study with traditional approaches. Here, we investigated the Ca 2 +-induced conformational changes with a combination of chemical cross-linking, mass spectrometry, bioinformatics analysis and modelling in Rosetta. Using a bifunctional linker, we found a large Ca 2 +-induced change to the cross-linking pattern in calreticulin. Our results are consistent with a high flexibility in the P-loop, a stabilization of the acidic C-terminal and a relatively close interaction of the P-loop and the acidic C-terminal. Biological significance The function of calreticulin, an endoplasmatic reticulin chaperone, is affected by fluctuations in Ca 2 + concentration, but the structural mechanism is unknown. The present work suggests that Ca 2 +-dependent regulation is caused by different conformations of a long proline-rich loop that changes the accessibility to the peptide/lectin-binding site. Our results indicate that the binding of Ca 2 + to calreticulin may thus not only <b>just</b> be <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> Ca 2 + storage but is likely {{to have an impact on}} the chaperone activity...|$|R
