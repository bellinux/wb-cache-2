5|$|Although {{capable of}} {{generating}} a high volume of fire, autocannon {{are limited by}} the amount of ammunition that can be carried by the weapons systems mounting them. For this reason, both the 25mm Bushmaster and the 30mm RARDEN are deliberately designed with relatively slow rates of fire, to extend the amount of time they can be employed on a battlefield before requiring a resupply of ammunition. The rate of <b>fire</b> <b>of</b> modern autocannon ranges from 90 rounds per minute, to 1,800 rounds per minute. Systems with multiple barrels—Gatling guns—can have rates of <b>fire</b> <b>of</b> several thousand rounds per minute; the fastest of these is the GSh-6-30K, which has a rate of <b>fire</b> <b>of</b> over 6,000rounds per minute.|$|E
5|$|The worst {{loss of life}} in United States history due to a {{wildfire}} {{occurred in}} 1871 when the Peshtigo Fire swept through Wisconsin, killing more than 1500 people. The Santiago Canyon <b>Fire</b> <b>of</b> 1889 in California and especially the Great <b>Fire</b> <b>of</b> 1910 in Montana and Idaho contributed to the philosophy that fire was a danger {{that needed to be}} suppressed. The Great <b>Fire</b> <b>of</b> 1910 burned , destroyed a number of communities and killed 86 people, and this event prompted various land management agencies to emphasize wildfire suppression. U.S. Government land agencies, including the National Park Service, generally followed the fire management policies established by the U.S. Forest Service, which oversees the majority of the nation's forestlands.|$|E

40|$|Firing {{the manager}} is a drastic measure {{employed}} by firms {{to deal with}} poor performance. However, data on within-firm dynamics are scarce, and the <b>firing</b> <b>of</b> individual managers is rarely recorded in the firm level data currently available. This makes the value <b>of</b> <b>firing</b> a manager difficult to assess. Data on sports offer {{a unique opportunity to}} study this phenomenon because the <b>firing</b> <b>of</b> a coach is usually well-publicized. Using data on soccer, the author evaluates the effect <b>of</b> the <b>firing</b> <b>of</b> a coach on team performance. As teams do not face the same opponents before and after a coach is <b>fired,</b> the issue <b>of</b> sample selectivity is addressed. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe basic {{characteristics}} <b>of</b> {{full surface}} <b>fires</b> <b>of</b> large scale floating roof tanks are briefed. It is {{pointed out that}} the present <b>fire</b> fighting systems <b>of</b> large scale crude oil storage depots cannot meet the need to extinguish full surface <b>fires</b> <b>of</b> large scale floating roof tanks. Adequate data of successful extinguishment of large scale tanks full surface fires and full scale tank fire experiments in the world are badly needed to design fire fighting system to extinguish full surface <b>fires</b> <b>of</b> large scale tanks in large scale crude oil storage depots. According to “Code of design for low expansion foam extinguishing system” and relative study results abroad, the fire fighting systems are calculated and designed to deal with full surface <b>fires</b> <b>of</b> large scale floating roof tanks. It is shown that designing parameters provided by API are more credible and large foam monitors act as the main fire extinguish facilities. The fire water supplying system is designed according to “Fire prevention code of petrochemical enterprise design”. The results show that the capability <b>of</b> the present <b>fire</b> fighting system should be raised up to at least 6 - 10 times to meet the need to extinguish full surface <b>fires</b> <b>of</b> large scale floating roof tanks. The reconstructing programs <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> fighting system are provided to deal with full surface <b>fires</b> <b>of</b> large scale floating roof tanks in the end...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{extends the}} {{applicability}} of exact analysis of the GSPN model by providing methods to improve the time and space complexity of both state space and structural level reduction. For state space level reduction, we maximize the concurrent <b>firing</b> <b>of</b> immediate transitions. For structural level reduction, we minimize the number of generated replicas for timed transitions by using branch and bound techniques to create concurrent replicas that simulate the <b>firing</b> <b>of</b> the timed transition followed by the simultaneously <b>firing</b> <b>of</b> multiple immediate transitions. ...|$|R

5|$|In the 17th century, {{the towers}} were {{redesigned}} in the Dutch Renaissance style {{but after the}} serious <b>fire</b> <b>of</b> 1702 they were temporarily replaced by low wooden tops. At the same time, the buttresses were removed giving the cathedral the rather plain look conveyed by pictures of the period. Only in 1740 were copper-faced spires installed, designed by Carl Hårleman. At the same time, Hårleman carried out significant work on the west façade. Today's towers are the work of Helgo Zettervall who completely rebuilt them in the 1880s, substantially increasing their height. After the serious <b>fire</b> <b>of</b> 1702, the original flying buttresses were removed and a higher roof was built.|$|E

It destroyed approximately 28% of the city (measured by counting the number of destroyed lots from the cadastre), left 20% of the population homeless, and the reconstruction lasted until 1737.
