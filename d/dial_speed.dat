In general, remote memory phonecards can be issued by any company and come in countless varieties. They can focus on calling to certain countries or regions and have specific features such as rechargeability, pinless <b>dial,</b> <b>speed</b> dial and more. Phone cards may have connection fees, taxes and maintenance fees, all influencing the rates.|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} of jatropha and groundnut oils as alternatives to diesel in {{oil based mud}} (OBM) formulations reveal comparable performance characteristics to that of diesel. The viscosity values of the mud samples from the three oils varied considerably. At the same viscometer <b>dial</b> <b>speed</b> of 600 RPM and temperature of 60 oC, the viscosities were 155, 135 and 50 centi poises (cP) for jatropha, groundnut and diesel oils based mud samples respectively. The jatropha and groundnut oil based mud samples were respectively 3 and 2. 7 times more viscous than diesel oil based mud. The increasing order of mud densities was 7. 5 ppg, 7. 9 ppg and 8. 5 ppg for diesel, groundnut and jatropha oils based mud samples respectively. Gel strength values at 10 secs and 10 mins were highest for diesel based mud than for jatropha and groundnut oil based muds while the True and Bingham yield points expectedly decreased as the mud temperature was increased.

30|$|This section here {{presents}} the rheological profile of bentonite drilling fluid containing grass particles of 35  μm. All DF systems show good dial readings with values increasing gradually from 3  rpm <b>dial</b> <b>speed</b> to 600  rpm. Figure  10 a shows the consistency curves for all concentrations of grass. All these curves {{are in good}} agreement with the Bingham plastic model, and {{it is observed that}} the shear stress increased with the concentration of grass at a given shear rate. It is seen from Fig.  10 b, c that the viscosities and the yield point gradually increased as the concentration of grass increased in the DF system. A DF with higher PV increases the ECD, surge, and swab pressures and also reduces the ROP with chances of differential sticking. It is known that a high yield point fluid has more practical significance as it indicates better cutting carrying capacity. As observed in Fig.  10 d, the initial and final gel strengths are found to be increasing gradually, which indicates better suspension of cuttings in the DF.|$|E
5000|$|Opera 9.20 {{introduced}} [...] "Speed Dial Browsing". The {{blank page}} {{when a new}} tab is opened is replaced with a page with slots which the user can set to contain webpage bookmarks. This feature {{is based on the}} <b>speed</b> <b>dial</b> browsing previously introduced in Opera Mini. New versions of Opera's <b>Speed</b> <b>Dial</b> improved the feature by allowing an unlimited number of <b>speed</b> <b>dial</b> entries, <b>Speed</b> <b>Dial</b> extensions, introducing groups, real-time search of entries, added support to user-defined backgrounds and different resolution display layouts (e.g. widescreen).|$|R
50|$|<b>Speed</b> <b>dialing</b> is also {{available}} via Custom Calling features from the Telephone Company's Central Office.

50|$|Previous {{screw mount}} Leicas used two {{separate}} shutter <b>speed</b> <b>dials</b> for slow and fast speeds (the fast <b>speed</b> <b>dial</b> {{on top of}} the camera rotated during firing). The M3 combined slower and faster <b>speeds</b> and the <b>dial</b> does not rotate during firing. Supposedly, this reduces vibrations in the camera. Early models used a non-geometrical series of shutter speeds. On later models this became the international standard of 1s to 1/1000s.|$|R
5000|$|Low digits: in {{the days}} of rotary dial telephones, using only those digits that require the least dial {{rotation}} (1 and 2) permitted a dial lock in hole 3 to effectively disable unauthorised access to the telephone network without preventing access to the emergency number 112. The same choice also maximised <b>dialling</b> <b>speed.</b> Additionally, telephone systems used pulse dialling instead of later DTMF tones; briefly activating the hook once has the same effect as dialling [...] "1", so repeatedly pushing the hook might result in calling 1-1-1. For this reason, Germany's police emergency number was changed from 111 to 110. With numeric keypads, pressing only the first and second button on the keypad is marginally easier in a difficult situation than other keys.|$|R
