5|$|Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) was {{designed}} by Microsoft to give higher-level access to a device's filesystem than USB mass storage, {{at the level of}} files rather than disk blocks. It also has optional DRM features. MTP {{was designed}} for use with portable media players, but it has since been adopted as the primary storage access protocol of the Android operating system from the version 4.1 <b>Jelly</b> <b>Bean</b> as well as Windows Phone 8 (Windows Phone 7 devices had used the Zune protocol which was an evolution of MTP). The primary {{reason for this is that}} MTP does not require exclusive access to the storage device the way UMS does, alleviating potential problems should an Android program request the storage while it is attached to a computer. The main drawback is that MTP is not as well supported outside of Windows operating systems.|$|E

As of September 2013, {{only a handful}} of devices have the hardware to support OpenGL ES 3.0, with Google officially supporting the standard in software since July 2013 with the introduction of Android 4.3 <b>Jelly</b> <b>Bean.</b> Games run at an average of 1 FPS. The developer has cited the Samsung Galaxy S4 {{as one of the first}} phones capable of playing games at higher speeds, but even it will have considerable performance limitations.|$|E
500|$|The SIII {{initially}} shipped with Android version 4.0.4, named [...] "Ice Cream Sandwich", {{which became}} commercially available in March 2012 with the Nexus S and Galaxy Nexus. Ice Cream Sandwich has a refined user interface, and expanded camera capabilities, security features and connectivity. In mid-June 2012, Google unveiled Android 4.1 [...] "Jelly Bean", which employs Google Now, a voice-assistant similar to S Voice, and incorporates other software changes. Samsung accommodated <b>Jelly</b> <b>Bean</b> in the SIII by making last-minute hardware {{changes to the}} phone in some markets. <b>Jelly</b> <b>Bean</b> updates began rolling out to SIIIs in selected European countries, and to the T-Mobile in the United States in November 2012. Samsung started pushing Android 4.1.2 <b>Jelly</b> <b>Bean</b> to the international version of the SIII in December 2012. In December 2013, Samsung began rolling out Android 4.3 for the SIII, adding user interface features back ported from the Galaxy S4, {{and support for the}} Samsung Galaxy Gear smartwatch. In March 2014, Samsung started the rollout of 4.4.2 KitKat for the 2 GB variant of the S III.|$|E

500|$|Nexus {{devices are}} {{considered}} the [...] "flagship" [...] Android devices and {{are the first to}} receive updates to the operating system. As such, the Nexus7 was the first device to have been shipped with Android version 4.1 ("Jelly Bean"). <b>Jelly</b> <b>Bean</b> was an incremental upgrade from version 4.0 ("Ice Cream Sandwich"), incorporating software improvements to the pull-down notifications bar and camera, and changes to the homescreen. With <b>Jelly</b> <b>Bean,</b> Google significantly reduced latency (lag), one negative aspect of Android compared to Apple's iOS operating system. It does so by employing [...] "vsync timing" [...] and triple buffering, improving touch responsiveness, and programming the display to run at 60 frames per second; this initiative was called [...] "Project Butter". The Nexus 7 was the first device to incorporate Google Chrome for Android as the standard web browser; all previous iterations of the Android OS used an unnamed application simply called Browser.|$|E
500|$|An {{update to}} Android 4.4.2 [...] "KitKat" [...] was {{released}} in South Korea in November 2013, and for international models in March 2014.

A further update added a new security feature known as [...] "Knock Code" [...] (as introduced by the LG G Pro 2), which allows users to unlock their device by tapping quadrants of the screen in a sequence.|$|E
500|$|The Nexus7 {{received}} favorable {{reviews from}} critics.

Walter Mossberg of The Wall Street Journal, David Pogue of The New York Times, and TechCrunch columnist MG Siegler acknowledged that Google and Asus had designed a serious competitor to Apple's iPad. Siegler wrote, [...] "ith the Nexus7, Google has, for the first time, created an Android product that I would buy for myself. And I wouldn't have an issue recommending it to anyone else." [...] Consumer-electronics publications Ars Technica, TechRadar, and CNET Australia reviewed the product favorably. Nathan Olivarez-Giles of Wired summed up his view: ...|$|E

500|$|One of {{the most}} highly touted {{features}} of <b>Jelly</b> <b>Bean</b> was Google Now, an intelligent personal assistant built into the Google Search app that is similar to Apple's Siri. According to Google, Google Now displays information in the form of cards that it predicts the user would find useful based on their search habits, such as traffic conditions, sports results, and weather. Google Now can translate a selected number of written languages and provide information on nearby places of interest. Whereas Siri only works on iOS products, Google Now is available on Android and iOS devices in addition to the desktop Google Chrome web browser; users and analysts regard Google Now to be superior to Siri. Popular Science named Google Now the [...] "Innovation of the Year" [...] for 2012.|$|E
500|$|The Nexus7 was {{revealed}} on June27, 2012, at Google I/O, an annual developer conference at Moscone Center in San Francisco, {{and it became}} available for pre-order on the same day. In addition, Android version 4.1, nicknamed [...] "Jelly Bean", {{was revealed}} during the keynote address by Hugo Barra, Director of Product Management for Android. The following day, a special white edition of the Nexus7 was given to Google I/O attendees, along with the Galaxy Nexus with <b>Jelly</b> <b>Bean</b> pre-installed, the Nexus Q, and a Chromebox. Barra announced that the tablet would retail for $199 for the 8GB version {{and that it would}} come with a free film, e-book, several magazines, and a $25 credit (available for redemption until September 30) to spend in Google Play, Android's digital multimedia distribution service. The Nexus7 was interpreted by technology commentators as Google's response to the inability of Android tablets to challenge the iPads' lead of the non-phone tablet market. Shares of Google increased by 0.8 percent to $569.37 that afternoon.|$|E

2500|$|Patches to bugs {{found in}} the core {{operating}} system often do not reach users of older and lower-priced devices. However, the open-source nature of Android allows security contractors to take existing devices and adapt them for highly secure uses.

2500|$|Jelly {{beans are}} a small bean-shaped type of {{confectionery}} with a hard candy shell and a gummy interior which come {{in a wide variety}} of flavors. The confection is primarily made of sugar. The Turkish Delight, a Middle Eastern candy made of soft jelly, covered in confectioner's powder, with roots dating to biblical days, was an early precursor to the <b>jelly</b> <b>bean</b> that inspired its gummy interior. However, it is generally thought that jelly beans first surfaced in 1861 when Boston confectioner and inventor William Schrafft urged people to send his jelly beans to soldiers during the American Civil War. It wasn't until July 5, 1905, that the mentioning of jelly beans was published in the Chicago Daily News.

2500|$|Other {{research}} suggests that soft drinks could play a special role in weight gain. One four-week experiment compared a 450 calorie/day supplement of sugar-sweetened soft drinks to a 450 calorie/day supplement of jelly beans. The <b>jelly</b> <b>bean</b> supplement {{did not lead to}} weight gain, but the soft drink supplement did. The likely reason for the difference in weight gain is that people who consumed the jelly beans lowered their caloric intake at subsequent meals, while people who consumed soft drinks did not. Thus, the low levels of satiety provided by sugar-sweetened soft drinks may explain their association with obesity. That is, people who consume calories in sugar-sweetened beverages may fail to adequately reduce their intake of calories from other sources. Indeed, people consume more total calories in meals and on days when they are given sugar-sweetened beverages than when they are given artificially sweetened beverages or water. However, these results are contradicted by a study by Adam Drewnowski published in 2004, in which [...] "32 subjects consumed a 300-calorie snack of fat-free raspberry cookies or regular cola on two occasions each – either two hours ("early") or 20 minutes ("late") before lunch." [...] It found that [...] "...the calories eaten at lunch were not affected by whether the snack was cookies or cola." ...|$|E
