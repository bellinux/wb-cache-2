5000|$|Quaking Houses is a {{small village}} near {{to the town of}} Stanley in County Durham, in England. It may have been {{originally}} settled by Quakers, but during the Industrial Revolution it developed into a mining village with traditional terraced houses. The Quaker origin is supported by the 1873 name for a mine with two shafts at the village called Quaker House Pit. However, an alternative origin is suggested by the following; the 1865 OS Map shows a farm called Quaking House to the north at Anfield Plain and a colliery railway line ran past this farm branching to the village mine. This colliery railway line was called the Quaking <b>House</b> <b>Branch</b> <b>Line.</b> A colloquial name for the village was [...] "nanny goat island" [...] perhaps reflecting the livestock kept in the extensive allotments and grazing area around the village.|$|E
50|$|Philip was {{the fifth}} son of the Margrave Christopher I of Baden and Ottilie of Katzenelnbogen. His father {{intended}} to avoid splitting the inheritance and regarded Philip as his most capable son, so he wanted Philip to inherit the sovereignty over all his territories. He intended Philip to marry with Joan, the heiress of Margrave Philip of Hachberg-Sausenberg — a junior <b>branch</b> of the <b>House</b> of Baden <b>branch</b> <b>line,</b> so that Philip would become sovereign of a considerable territory. The plan failed due to resistance of the French king.|$|R
50|$|In 1925/1926, Southern Pacific {{extended}} the <b>branch</b> <b>line</b> 8 miles east into the Sierras to its ending point known as Kentucky House (or Kentucky Home). The last 4 {{miles of the}} <b>branch</b> at Kentucky <b>House</b> were sold to the Calaveras Cement Company on April 28, 1929. The Calaveras Cement Company closed the plant at Kentucky House in 1984. Prior to 1984, the SP was operating three freight trains per week between Lodi and Kentucky <b>House.</b> The <b>branch</b> was listed in Southern Pacific timetables as the Kentucky <b>House</b> <b>Branch</b> and interchanged at Lodi with the SP mainline that ran from Stockton - Sacramento. After the cement plant closed, the branch was used to store railroad freight cars. Eventually the tracks were removed.|$|R
