5|$|After being vested {{the power}} to award its own degrees {{separately}} from the University of London in 2006, graduates began wearing King's College London academic dress in 2008. King's graduates have since worn <b>gowns</b> designed by Vivienne Westwood.|$|E
5|$|Other {{traditions and}} customs vary by college. For example, some colleges have formal hall {{six times a}} week, but in others this only happens occasionally. At most colleges these formal meals require <b>gowns</b> to be worn, and a Latin grace is said.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gown</b> (from Medieval Latin gunna) was a basic {{clothing}} {{term for}} hundreds of years, referring to a garment that hangs from the shoulders. In Medieval and Renaissance England <b>gown</b> referred to a loose outer garment worn by both men and women, sometimes short, more often ankle length, with sleeves. By the 18th century <b>gown</b> had become a standard category term for a women's dress, a meaning it retained until the mid-20th century. Only {{in the last few}} decades has <b>gown</b> lost this general meaning in favor of dress. Today the term <b>gown</b> is rare except in specialized cases: academic dress or cap and <b>gown,</b> evening <b>gown,</b> nightgown, hospital <b>gown,</b> and so on (see <b>Gown).</b>|$|R

50|$|The BA <b>gown</b> is a {{long black}} clerical-type <b>gown</b> with long {{bell-shaped}} sleeves to the wrists. The <b>gown</b> is gathered at the yoke. The MA <b>gown</b> {{is similar to the}} BA <b>gown,</b> except that the long sleeves are squared and closed at the ends, with a crescent cut out of each sleeve-end, and a horizontal slit just above the elbow for the arm to pass through.|$|R
5|$|Altogether, around fifty Christian {{artifacts}} {{were found}} in Hasekura's estate in 1640, such as crosses, rosaries, religious <b>gowns</b> and religious paintings. The artifacts were seized and stored by the Date fief. An inventory was made again in 1840 describing the items as belonging to Hasekura Tsunenaga. Nineteen books were also mentioned in the inventory, {{but they have been}} lost since. The artifacts are today preserved in the Sendai City Museum and other museums in Sendai.|$|E

Following the success of Jerry's opening night in London, Jerry follows Dale to Venice, where she is visiting Madge and modelling/promoting the <b>gowns</b> created by Alberto Beddini (Erik Rhodes), a dandified Italian fashion designer with a penchant for malapropisms.|$|E
5|$|South Stoneham House was acquired, with South Hill (some {{two miles}} to the northwest), in 1920 to house male {{students}} at University College Southampton. The salmon pool at South Stoneham was retained by the Montagu family, {{becoming part of the}} Townhill Park estate. Tradition prevailed in the house, with a collegiate atmosphere as <b>gowns</b> were expected to be worn to dinner and lectures and curfews were enforced.|$|E
2500|$|There are two {{distinctive}} shapes {{used in the}} UK for doctor's gowns; the Oxford doctor's {{shape and}} the Cambridge doctor's shape. The former has bell-shaped sleeves, the latter has long open sleeves. Another rarer form is the Cambridge Doctor of Music dress <b>gown</b> which is a pattern between the two. [...] The other form of doctor's <b>gown</b> is the undress <b>gown.</b> This is a black <b>gown</b> worn for less formal occasions such as lectures. This type of <b>gown</b> is rarely seen or worn nowadays as many wear the dress <b>gown</b> instead; however, the undress <b>gown</b> still plays {{a part in the}} older universities where academic dress is usually worn.|$|R
25|$|Another type of <b>gown</b> {{is called}} the lay type <b>gown,</b> {{which is similar to}} the MA <b>gown</b> in that it has long closed sleeves, but does not have a yoke. Instead, there is a flap collar with the gathers {{underneath}} it. Thus it is less voluminous than the clerical type <b>gown.</b> This <b>gown</b> is often used for the dress of officers and graduates of some degrees (especially at Oxford and Durham).|$|R
25|$|St Andrews prescribes a cassock-like <b>gown</b> with a row {{of buttons}} running down the front, {{coloured}} according to the degree, and {{is meant to be}} worn closed. This <b>gown</b> is worn as the undress <b>gown</b> for higher doctorates, with a Cambridge-type <b>gown</b> for full dress. The two may be worn together or separately.|$|R
5|$|The inauguration {{ceremony}} {{was conducted by}} the civic authorities and by the surviving, and still powerful, Guild of StGeorge, and combined elements of a public festival and a religious carnival. Four whifflers (city officials carrying swords) marched ahead of the procession to clear a path. Behind the whifflers, the incoming and outgoing mayors rode side-by-side, preceded by trumpeters and standard-bearers carrying the banners of England and St George, and followed by the city's Sheriffs and Aldermen in ceremonial <b>gowns</b> of violet and red, respectively. The procession was flanked by the city's waits (musicians playing loud wind instruments, usually the shawm) (a mediaeval double reed wind instrument with conical wooden body), and accompanied by dick fools (clowns carrying wands and wearing red and yellow <b>gowns</b> adorned with bells and cats' tails) and a man costumed as a dragon.|$|E
5|$|The only useful ways {{to reduce}} the spread of cold viruses are {{physical}} measures such as hand washing and face masks; in the healthcare environment, <b>gowns</b> and disposable gloves are also used. Isolation or quarantine is not used as the disease is so widespread and symptoms are non-specific. Vaccination has proved difficult as there are many viruses involved and they mutate rapidly. Creation of a broadly effective vaccine is, thus, highly improbable.|$|E
5|$|A second Feast Day {{was added}} in 2007 by a benefaction from George Moody, {{formerly}} of Oriel, {{to be celebrated}} on or near St George's Day (23 April). The only remaining gaudy had been Candlemas; the new annual dinner was {{to be known as}} the St. George's Day Gaudy. The dinner is black tie and <b>gowns,</b> and by request of the benefactor, the main course will normally be goose. The inaugural event took place on Wednesday 25 April 2007.|$|E

50|$|In 2012 a new St Leonard's College <b>gown</b> was {{introduced}} for those {{members of that}} College whose original universities do not have academic dress. This is black <b>gown</b> faced with burgundy. It {{was introduced}} so as to better integrate those postgraduates whose original universities do not have academic dress into the <b>gown</b> tradition at St Andrews. St Andrews graduates wear the <b>gown</b> of their degree as may those of other universities, or they may choose to wear the St Leonard's College <b>gown.</b> Graduate students in St Mary's College wear the graduate <b>gown</b> with a violet cross on the left facing.|$|R
50|$|Less formally, a verger may wear a <b>gown</b> {{without a}} cassock below, or, conversely, a cassock without the <b>gown.</b> In more modern settings, a verger might wear a {{scapular}} {{instead of a}} <b>gown.</b>|$|R
5|$|Following Kennedy's death, Marcus {{maintained}} {{close ties}} with Johnson and his administration, being considered for diplomatic posts to France and to the United Nations General Assembly while continuing to run his company and providing the wedding dresses for both the Johnsons' daughters, personally assisting Luci Johnson in selecting the designer for her own dress and the styles for the bridesmaids' <b>gowns.</b> After Johnson's retirement, Marcus's invitations were among the few the former president and his wife continued to accept. Marcus's own daughter Wendy joined Mrs. Johnson's staff {{for a time in}} 1963, working under Mrs. Johnson's personal secretary, Liz Carpenter.|$|E
5|$|Norman wore {{a variety}} of brightly colored, {{elaborate}} costumes and was often photographed by media while wearing royal-style <b>gowns</b> and wigs and holding a scepter. She stated that her habiliments mirrored the practices of extraterrestrials, whose attire she said was brighter and more radiant than clothing on Earth. At the group's headquarters, she had a gold-colored throne that was decorated with peacock feathers. Her assistants helped shepherd her media image; Kirkpatrick and Tumminia speculate that her charisma was primarily responsible for gaining publicity for the group.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} days of the Flamingo {{engagement}} went by smoothly. On July 1, when reporting for makeup and wardrobe before their first show of the evening, Ballard discovered an extra set of <b>gowns</b> and costumes that had been brought along for Cindy Birdsong. Angered, Ballard performed the first concert of the night inebriated, leading to an embarrassing on-stage incident in which her stomach was revealed when she purposely thrust it forward during a dance routine. Enraged, Gordy ordered her back to Detroit and permanently dismissed her from the group. Birdsong officially assumed her place during the second July 1 show.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{seventeen}} outfits, twelve {{hats and}} {{pairs of shoes}} that she donated were a 1948 Balenciaga evening <b>gown</b> of organdie with flock flowers, an evening <b>gown</b> from 1965, a 1949 hand-painted evening <b>gown</b> by Marcelle Chaumont and a 1950s evening <b>gown</b> by Jeanne Lafaurie, the only dress by that designer {{in the collection of}} Victoria & Albert Museum.|$|R

5|$|The video {{opens on}} a stately room, with plum colored walls and antique furniture. Bunton opens a large, black door and is {{followed}} by Halliwell, Beckham, Mel B and Chisholm. The girls are dressed in beautiful <b>gowns</b> throughout the video, presumably designed by Roberto Cavalli, who designed the costumes for their then-upcoming tour. Vignettes of the girls singing together and separately are sewn {{together to create a}} collage. Fading in and out, the music video ends with the girls combined together although they are at different places.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Eric Morley {{organized}} the Festival Bikini Contest, a beauty contest and swimwear advertising opportunity at that year's Festival of Britain. The press, welcoming the spectacle, {{referred to it}} as Miss World, a name Morley registered as a trademark. The winner was Kiki Håkansson of Sweden, who was crowned in a bikini. After the crowning, Håkansson was condemned by Pope Pius XII, while Spain and Ireland threatened to withdraw from the pageant. In 1952, bikinis were banned from the pageant and replaced by evening <b>gowns.</b> As a result of the controversy, the bikini was explicitly banned from many other beauty pageants worldwide. Though some regarded the bikini and beauty contests as bringing freedom to women, they were opposed by some feminists as well as religious and cultural groups who objected to the degree of exposure of the female body.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, {{just before the}} {{outbreak}} of World War II, there was {{a revival of the}} hooped crinoline from designers such as Edward Molyneux, who put hoops in both day skirts and evening <b>gowns,</b> and Norman Hartnell, whose late 1930s Winterhalter-inspired crinoline designs for Queen Elizabeth were so successful that the Queen is popularly (if inaccurately) credited with having single-handedly brought crinolines back into fashion. Both as Queen, and as the Queen Mother, Elizabeth adopted the traditional bell-shaped crinoline as her signature look for evening wear and state occasions. The film Gone With The Wind, released in 1939, inspired the American fashion for prom dresses with crinolines in Spring 1940.|$|E

5|$|The {{panel is}} the {{smallest}} extant work by van der Weyden and follows the tradition of a Madonna Lactans, with significant differences. Christ {{is dressed in a}} red garment, as opposed to the swaddling he usually wears in 15th-century Virgin and Child portrayals. This is one of two exceptions where he is fully clothed; the other is Robert Campin's Madonna in Frankfurt, where he is shown in blue clothing. Mary's unbound blond hair falls across her shoulders and down across her arms. Showing the influence of Campin, it is brushed behind the ears. She wears a crown as Queen of Heaven and a ring on a finger as the Bride of Christ. Reinforcing this, the blue colour of her robe alludes to her devotion and fidelity to her son. The folds of her dress are reminiscent of the lengthy, crisp, curved intertwined <b>gowns</b> of Gothic sculpture.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, Victoria {{had written}} {{instructions}} for her funeral, {{which was to}} be military as befitting a soldier's daughter {{and the head of the}} army, and white instead of black. On 25 January, Edward VII, the Kaiser and Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, helped lift her body into the coffin. She was dressed in a white dress and her wedding veil. An array of mementos commemorating her extended family, friends and servants were laid in the coffin with her, at her request, by her doctor and dressers. One of Albert's dressing <b>gowns</b> was placed by her side, with a plaster cast of his hand, while a lock of John Brown's hair, along with a picture of him, was placed in her left hand concealed from the view of the family by a carefully positioned bunch of flowers. Items of jewellery placed on Victoria included the wedding ring of John Brown's mother, given to her by Brown in 1883. Her funeral was held on Saturday 2 February, in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, and after two days of lying-in-state, she was interred beside Prince Albert in Frogmore Mausoleum at Windsor Great Park.|$|E
5|$|Maury Gertsman, {{who handled}} the {{cinematography}} for nearly all Universal Pictures films from the mid-1940s to mid-1950s, worked as director of photography on The Brute Man. Since the film focused on a disfigured serial killer, Gertsman sought to give the movie a dark, diseased look appropriate for the film's subject matter and urban setting. Although primarily a horror thriller film, Gertsman uses several film noir elements in his photography, including shadowed lighting, unbalanced compositions, and chiaroscuro contrasts between light and dark. As a result, The Brute Man features a bleak, at times dismal visual atmosphere. Hans J. Salter, who composed the scores {{for many of the}} Universal Pictures films of the 1940s and 1950s, worked as composer for The Brute Man as well. Salter's score for the film strongly resembled the music he composed for the Universal horror films Black Friday (1940) and The Invisible Man's Revenge (1944). Philip Cahn edited The Brute Man. Raymond Kessler and Ralph Slosser worked as dialogue director and assistant director, respectively, while John B. Goodman and Abraham Grossman worked as art directors. Other crew included Russell A. Gausman and Edward R. Robinson as set decorators, Joe Lapis as sound technician, Jack Pierce as make-up director, Carmen Dirigo as hair stylist, and Vera West as <b>gowns</b> supervisor.|$|E
