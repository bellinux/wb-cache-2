40|$|Predictive {{statements}} {{deserve a}} specific grammatical inquiry, {{since they have}} not only an epistemological status, but also appear in Wittgenstein"s writings on philosophy of psychology and touch deeply the problem of free will. So predictive knowledge covers a very large spectrum of human experience. This grammatical exploration leads to acknowledge an essential difference between predictive statements, which are expressions or <b>exteriorisations</b> of will (Willensäusserungen) and predictions, which are made {{from the perspective of}} the third person (although they can be uttered in the first). As Wittgenstein notes: "Two things however, are important: one, that in many cases someone else cannot predict my actions, whereas I foresee them in my intentions; the other, that my prediction (in my expression of intention) has not the same foundation as his prediction of what I shall do, and the conclusions to be drawn from these predictions are quite differentâ€? (PI, Iixi, 224 e). It is the grammatical elucidation of predictive language games that allows us to solve the problem of the incompatibility between predicted and at the same time free choices...|$|R
40|$|Preface: This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with an experimental investigation of abomasal secretion in sheep. The abomasum is the most caudal region of the ruminant stomach {{and is the only}} truly secretory part of it. The experimental work considered includes the study of hydrochloric acid secretion, the electrolyte composition and the peptic activity of abomasal secretion. Simultaneous observations have been made of abomasal acid secretion and motility of the reticulum and rumen recorded from partial <b>exteriorisations</b> of these structures. These observations have been made under a variety of conditions including periods when animals were feeding and fasted, and during rumination. The effect of intraduodenal infusions of fatty acids and oil on abomasal acid secretion and reticulum and rumen motility and of intravenous infusions of the same fatty acids has been studied Observations have also been made of the intravenous infusion of various substances reported to influence gastric secretion. Extracts exhibiting 'enterogastrone' activity have been tested; the effects of insulin studied; and the action of a synthetic gastrin (ICI 50, 123) which exhibits gastrin-like properties has been investigated. These observations were undertaken in the hope that {{it would be possible to}} elucidate further, factors which control or affect ab omasal acid secretion. An attempt has been made to determine whether any clear cut relation could be established between abomasal secretory activity and reticulorumenal motility. The observations presented below have been discussed in relation to the literature...|$|R

30|$|There are {{interesting}} shifts {{involved in the}} differentiation of varying modes of understanding: understanding is either based upon a specific disposition of the scientist (who strives to acquire a “feeling for the natural world”, to intuitively understand it), it is a situation the scientist is in (she/he is not fundamentally different but with or without understanding) or it is a property separable from the scientist, the object is either understood or not. Lyotard (1982) similarly speaks about an “intrinsic <b>exteriorisation</b> of knowledge {{in relation to the}} knower” (ibid: 16). “The old principle, according to which knowledge gain is inseparably linked to the education of the mind and the person itself, declines successively. Knowledge … ceases to be its own purpose; it loses its utility value”. (Lyotard 1979 / 2009 : 31, transl. by the author). Moreover, subject and object switch from being intrinsically linked (understanding as an incorporated feeling for the object) to being fundamentally separated (understanding as objectivation) and to being causally linked (mechanistic understanding that allows for controlled intervention later onwards). And finally, understanding can point towards a holistic approach (understanding as antagonistic to intervention) or towards a mechanistic approach (understanding equals predictive and interventionist power and allows for a mechanisation of the object so that the object can be treated successfully {{as if it were a}} machine). These three processes, <b>exteriorisation</b> of knowledge, objectivation in the relation of subject and object, and mechanisation of the epistemic object, could be addressed as practices or stances in themselves; or at least, they are accomplished by specific actions taken by researchers. However, they are not treated in the same way as the contemplative or interventionist stance here, because they point towards more fundamental aspects of research and the shaping of research settings and can occur in practises related to understanding as well as intervention or construction. <b>Exteriorisation</b> of knowledge prepares the ground for its commodification and enabling character; objectivation prepares the ground for intervention from subject to object; mechanisation prepares the ground for mechanic intervention and construction.|$|E

40|$|In {{his massive}} multi-volume work Technics and Time Bernard Stiegler explores {{a history of}} {{technics}} as epiphylogenesis—the preservation in technical objects of epigenetic experience. Epiphylogenesis for Stiegler marks a break with genetic evolution (which cannot preserve the lessons of experience), a break which also constitutes the “invention ” of the human. As Stiegler {{puts it in the}} general introduction to Technics and Time: “As a‘process of <b>exteriorisation,</b> ’ technics is the pursuit of life by means other than life. ” (Technics and Time 17) Since the “human ” is constituted through its <b>exteriorisation</b> into tools, its origin is neither biological (a particular arrangement of cells) nor transcendental (to be found in something like consciousness). The origin of the human as the prosthesis of the living is therefore fundamentally aporetic: one should speak, for Stiegler, of a non-origin or default of origin. 1 Stiegler develops these arguments through a reading of Rousseau and Leroi-Gourhan, showing on the one hand how the the empirical approach of the palaeo-anthropologist cannot avoid the transcendental question of origin and, on the other, how Rousseau’s transcendental account of the question of origin inscribes inside its account, despite itself, the thought of the human as contingent or accidental (Technics and Time 82 - 133) ...|$|E

In our opinion, spontaneous rupture of the oesophagus, instrumental perforation, open and closed traumatic lesions, and postoperative anastomotic leaks are, as far as diagnosis and management are concerned, different aspects of the same desperate surgical problem. Oesophageal trauma is accompanied by a high morbidity and mortality rate if diagnosis and treatment are delayed. Perforations of the cervical oesophagus may be treated conservatively.

40|$|Art {{is about}} the {{exploration}} of the strange and disturbing; it is not about classical fine crafting. Artists use artworks to exteriorise their inner landscapes, thereby allowing others to experience their take on life, at least vicariously. It is this <b>exteriorisation</b> which is ‘art’, not the aesthetic features of the individual artworks themselves, which is properly the domain of crafting and design. Aesthetics cannot explain the work of many major modern contemporary artists, because it fails to locate the underlying unifying ideas. Jeff Koons qualifies as an artist not because of his production of standalone objects, but because behind these objects is a distinctive and unusual mentality and mindset which gives meaning to them.

Stemming from the discipline of Dance Movement Psychotherapy (DMP), a psychotherapeutic approach which makes use of embodied perceptual practices such as movement, play and dance, it draws on a recent study (Panhofer 2009) which shows some of the limitations of language. Supporting a psycho-corporeal integration, it emphasizes other possible ways of communicating the embodied experience, such as through metaphors, images, and poetry. Where it is difficult to communicate an inner experience through verbal narration, such as practiced in verbal psychotherapy, metaphors, images and poetry may offer a useful alternative, alongside the embodied perceptual practices such as play, movement, and dance...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{study will}} examine epigraphic writing {{and ask if}} in the visual, {{material}} and nonverbal part of the written communication, a graphic complement for linguistic differentiation (Latin / French) in medieval inscriptions, existed.

Yet when dealing with ‘exposed’ or ‘monumental’ writings – expressions which can define {{a great part of}} inscriptions – these issues are even more significant because the <b>exteriorisation</b> of the text and its mise en voir for a large audience were fundamental.

40|$|Omphaloceles {{and left}} {{ventricular}} diverticulums are rare disorders. Although either {{is known to}} occur on its own, the combination is highly suggestive of the so-called pentalogy of Cantrell. This syndrome {{is a combination of}} deformities involving midline structures, with <b>exteriorisation</b> of the heart, or 'ectopia cordis', as the most severe malformation. A cause has yet to be identified, though genes located on the X-chromosome may be involved. We discuss a neonate who presented with an omphalocele and a palpable diverticulum of the left ventricle. An omphalocele, especially when above the umbilicus, is an indication for further investigation for deformities as seen in the spectrum of Cantrell's pentalogy, especially cardiac malformations and anterior diaphragmatic herniation. A left ventricular diverticulum is usually associated with Cantrell's syndrome. When found, it is usually accompanied by other intracardiac malformations, so that again further examination is indicated. In our patient, there was an atrial septal defect within the oval fossa, along with a ventricular septal defect and unobstructed albeit anomalous venous pulmonary return to the left atrium. Early surgical intervention seems to be indicated, as spontaneous rupture, arrhythmias, and thromobogenicity of the ventricular diverticulum have all been reported...|$|E

40|$|Introduction The paper {{describes}} a very rare, isolated exocranial complication of the purulent frontal sinus inflammation. Frontal bone osteomyelitis occurs {{either in the}} course of an acute episode or during the exacerbation of a chronic disease. By distribution, it can be diffuse or circumscript. It is more common in younger males. Case Outline The case described is one of a 43 -year-old patient with purulent frontal sinusitis developing into osteomyelitis of the anterior wall of the right frontal sinus, accompanied by the <b>exteriorisation</b> of the process into the frontal region soft tissues. The classical paranasal sinus radiography did not find any pathological changes in bony structures. Computerised tomography findings pointed to purulent inflammation of the frontal and part of the ethmoid sinuses, with a defect of the anterior wall of the right frontal sinus. Conclusion Surgical exploration established a defect in the anterior wall of the right frontal sinus, with an organised purulent collection, 1. 3 cm in diameter. During surgery, evacuation of the inflamed mucosa and obliteration of the right frontal sinus were performed.

40|$|Background: The CORONIS Trial was a 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 non-regular, fractional, {{factorial}} {{trial of}} five pairs of alternative caesarean section surgical techniques {{on a range}} of short-term outcomes, the primary outcome being a composite of maternal death or infectious morbidity. The consequences of different surgical techniques on longer term outcomes have not been well assessed in previous studies. Such outcomes include those related to subsequent pregnancy: mode of delivery; abnormal placentation (e. g. accreta); postpartum hysterectomy, as well as longer term pelvic problems: pain, urinary problems, infertility. The Coronis Follow-up Study aims to measure and compare the incidence of these outcomes between the randomised groups at around three years after women participated in the CORONIS Trial.

40|$|The {{structural}} changes in economics {{that occurred in}} the age of globalisation {{had a profound effect on}} the labour and job configuration in modern societies. The prevalence of neoliberal economic policies together with the crisis of the welfare state, the new international labour distribution, and the spread of information and communication technologies are just some of the factors that contributed to the crisis in the forms of social regulation of the labour market. This instability of the labour market generated the crisis of full employment, security and stability of paid employment and very noticeably social integration through employment, thus having multiple effects of social exclusion. As it constitutes one of the major problems of our days, the crisis in employment has drawn the attention of researchers, politicians and the media and the interpretation of the major trends is far from reaching consensus or being peaceful (see Morin, 1996). Out of the various theories that have analysed the theme 2 we find particularly relevant the approaches that deny the end of labour society and the extinction of its value in modern societies and point to the expansion of new labour and job modalities, based on new forms of <b>exteriorisation,</b> namely its diversification, heterogeneity and invisibility.

40|$|Meeting" is one {{of these}} concepts, which in the most recent {{philosophy}} have received significant meaning. In some interpretations it is the instruction to "meet" – so to establish the unmediated relation with the Other – is the factor, which allows to break free from the pressure of the "Hegelian bite" and problems resulting from it. It turns out that the ennoblement of the subject made by the German idealism in fact limited the reality only to its <b>exteriorisation</b> – and thus put into question the possibility of reaching the reality, including the reality of other people. "Meeting" would be the bridge thanks to which this reach (again) becomes possible. However, it seems that speaking about the "meeting" we still too rarely think about the prerequisites, which must be met, so that the subject can open itself to accept the Other. This is an important analysis because, first of all, it allows to judge whether the whole project of the postphenomenological philosophy can be defended in the practical perspective, and secondly – it is a key indicator that allows the further development of the human thought. It turns out that for the elementary human experience the "meeting" is not an excess, and the opening to what is unusual is the natural element of the existence of human cultures.

The CORONIS trial was a pragmatic international 2  ×  2  ×  2  ×  2 ×  2 non-regular fractional, factorial, unmasked, {{randomised controlled trial}} done at 19 sites in Argentina, Chile, Ghana, India, Kenya, Pakistan, and Sudan. Pregnant women were eligible {{if they were to}} undergo their first or second caesarean section through a planned transverse abdominal incision. Women were randomly assigned by a secure web-based allocation system to one intervention from each of the three assigned pairs. All investigators, surgeons, and participants were unmasked to treatment allocation. In this follow-up study, we compared outcomes at 3 years following blunt versus sharp abdominal entry, <b>exteriorisation</b> of the uterus for repair versus intra-abdominal repair, single versus double layer closure of the uterus, closure versus non-closure of the peritoneum, and chromic catgut versus polyglactin- 910 for uterine repair. Outcomes included pelvic pain; deep dyspareunia; hysterectomy and outcomes of subsequent pregnancies. Outcomes were assessed masked to the original trial allocation. This trial is registered with the Current Controlled Trials registry, number ISRCTN 31089967. Between Sept 1, 2011, and Sept 30, 2014, 13, 153 (84 %) women were followed-up for a mean duration of 3 · 8 years (SD 0 · 86). For blunt versus sharp abdominal entry {{there was no evidence of}} a difference in risk of abdominal hernias (adjusted RR 0 · 66; 95 % CI 0 · 39 - 1 · 11). We also recorded no evidence of a difference in risk of death or serious morbidity of the children born at the time of trial entry (0 · 99, 0 · 83 - 1 · 17). For <b>exteriorisation</b> of the uterus versus intra-abdominal repair there was no evidence of a difference in risk of infertility (0 · 91, 0 · 71 - 1 · 18) or of ectopic pregnancy (0 · 50, 0 · 15 - 1 · 66). For single versus double layer closure of the uterus there was no evidence of a difference in maternal death (0 · 78, 0 · 46 - 1 · 32) or a composite of pregnancy complications (1 · 20, 0 · 75 - 1 · 90). For closure versus non-closure of the peritoneum there was no evidence of a difference in any outcomes relating to symptoms associated with pelvic adhesions such as infertility (0 · 80, 0 · 61 - 1 · 06). For chromic catgut versus polyglactin- 910 sutures there was no evidence of a difference in the main comparisons for adverse pregnancy outcomes in a subsequent pregnancy, such as uterine rupture (3 · 05, 0 · 32 - 29 · 29). Overall, severe adverse outcomes were uncommon in these settings. Although our study was not powered to detect modest differences in rare but serious events, there was no evidence to favour one technique over another. Other considerations will probably affect clinical practice, such as the time and cost saving of different approaches.

40|$|What do {{citizens}} {{say about}} Europe? Before {{the crisis of}} 2008 citizens in Britain, France and Francophone Belgium were 'overlooking' Europe by ignoring it in favour of globalisation, economic flows, and crises of political corruption. Innovative focus group methods allow analysis {{of the nature of}} their reactions and positions, and demonstrate how euroscepticism is a red herring. Instead they articulate indifference to and ambivalence about Europe contrasting with activists who engage in conflict about European issues. The analysis shows national and social differences. French projection contrasts with British <b>exteriorisation</b> and Belgian incorporation. The social gap {{is not a matter of}} deficits: workers have real arguments about issues close to home while managers show more concern about European politics. This book is part of the qualitative turn in European studies and both complements and challenges established knowledge on European attitudes.
