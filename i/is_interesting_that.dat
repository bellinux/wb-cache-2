5|$|In Ontario, Riesling is {{commonly}} used for Icewine, where the wine is noted for its breadth and complexity. Niagara is a major producer of ice wine in general, putting it neck-and-neck with Germany. Late Harvest wines and some sparkling wines are produced with Riesling in Niagara but it is table wines from dry to off-dry that hold the largest share of production. The climate of the region is typically quite warm in the summertime which adds a layer of richness in the wines. It <b>is</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> the founder of St. Urbanshoff in the Mosel, Herman Weiss, was an early pioneer in Niagara's modern viticulture, selling his strain of Mosel clone Riesling to many producers in west Niagara (these vines are well over 20 years old now). This clone and Niagara's summer heat make for uniquely bright wines and often show up in interesting dry styled versions. Many producers and wine critics will argue that Niagara's best offerings come from the Niagara Escarpment region which encompasses the Short Hills Bench, 20 Mile Bench and Beamsville Bench.|$|E
25|$|The blossoming of {{literature}} in the Ardalan principality was accompanied by an intense cultivation of music. Music is {{an essential element of}} the cultural tradition of the Yarsan religious community. In connection with this, it <b>is</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> the Kurds in East and South Kurdistan, where to the Gorani culture was spread, call songs 'Gorani'.|$|E
25|$|In Shakespeare's The Tempest, the masque that Prospero conjures to {{celebrate}} the troth-pledging of Miranda and Ferdinand echoes the Eleusinian Mysteries, although it uses the Roman names for the deities involved – Ceres, Iris, Dis and others – instead of the Greek. It <b>is</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> a play which is so steeped in esoteric imagery from alchemy and hermeticism should draw on the Mysteries for its central masque sequence.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps the {{earliest}} known source to mention Rollo's early life is the French chronicler Richer of Reims, who claims (in the 10th century) that Rollo {{was the son of}} a Viking named Ketill. In terms of onomastics, it <b>is</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> Richer also names– without explicitly linking him to Rollo– a man named Ketill as being the leader of subsequent Viking raids (in 888), against areas on the coast of West Francia, between the Seine and the Loire.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> {{packaging}} {{for many}} of the promotional offerings was identical to that of other diecast manufacturers. For example, the Mercedes Unimog (shown here) had an identical silver black-lined box design to that of the NZG Mercedes Coupe. The only difference is the precise box size and the color of the lettering stating what vehicle came inside. This is evidence of the control of the client over many promotional companies and their offerings. Obviously, Mercedes wanted a particular appearance for its packaged products and required that across multiple providers.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> the Court of Chancery was acting, here, in {{its most}} ancient role, that of a court of conscience. This entailed the moral law applied to prevent peril to {{the soul of the}} {{wrongdoer}} through mortal sin. The remedy was given to the plaintiff (the Crown, in this case) to look after the wrongdoer's soul; the benefit to the plaintiff was only incidental. This is also the explanation for specific performance, which compels the sinner to put matters right. The whole conception is mediæval in origin.|$|E

25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> the {{distinction}} between the first two rules and the latter rule can also be found in early treatises on music, introducing the terms metrum and rhythmus. As it could also be demonstrated by Van Kampen that melodic peaks often coincide with the word accent (see also), the conclusion seems warranted that the Gregorian melodies enhance the expressiveness of the Latin words by mimicking to some extent both the accentuation of the sacred words (pitch differences between neumes) and the relative duration of the word syllables (by paying attention to well-defined length differences between the individual notes of a neume).|$|E
25|$|The {{diameter}} of the orifice and cavity is d, the distance between orifice and cavity is h, and the orifice pressure P was given in kilograms per meter squared. At the lower limit of h the second term disappears. In this case, the equation could have been reformatted {{in terms of the}} acoustical Strouhal number as shown in the second equation above. The characteristic speed U at the nozzle is the sound speed c0. It <b>is</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> the number is very close to that found by Strouhal for flow over a cylinder. There are two characteristic length scales. Nozzle diameter d characterizes the sound power while the separation distance h characterizes the frequency.|$|E
25|$|A {{million people}} in our country and abroad like songs like Kalinka, Katyusha, Smuglyanka and the other songs of the {{military}} years as well as The Day of the Victory, Dark Eyes, Vecherny zvon and Podmoskovnye vechera. All these songs are known because of the Alexandrov folk song and dance company and {{people want to hear}} these songs at every concert. They are not just part of our history; they are great masterpieces. It <b>is</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> Svyaschennaya Voyna, written by Alexander Vasilyevich Alexandrov in 1941, helped Soviet soldiers to protect their Motherland and is still popular in Slovakia, Poland and Bulgaria. Those audiences listen to it standing up and it touches their hearts and souls.|$|E

25|$|The {{start of}} Quaestiones is {{definitely}} after 8 July 1661, {{the date on}} which Newton arrived in Trinity College. It is also definitely before 9 December 1664, on which day (and the following) he made notes of his observations of a comet. Other datings of the first entries are based on his handwriting— which changed drastically between the early notes of 1661 and later notes which can be dated independently to 1665. The transitional handwriting which characterises the early parts of Quaestiones can only be independently dated to roughly 1664. It <b>is</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> this was written during a period when Newton was actively developing the notion of calculus, but mathematics made no real appearance in this notebook.|$|E
25|$|The 150 sedan {{shows an}} {{interesting}} trend in promotional offerings when comparing the early 1950s {{with the early}} 1960s. The pre-performance, post-war era of practicality in the early 1950s gave emphasis to more economical sedans, so it is notable that early promotional model makers commonly molded vehicles in 4-door configurations {{even in the most}} basic models available. Four-door Bel Airs were offered by PMC {{all the way up to}} 1958, one available with police decor. It <b>is</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> PMC also did a 1958 Chevrolet in two-door style, reinforcing the trend that by about 1960 most promotional makers only modeled sportier and more powerful 2-door coupes and hardtops. However, a molded red four door did became a Fire Chief car. This was in line with the newer era of a stronger economy, more affluent clientele and the onset of the new baby-boomer driver's market.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{jewellery}} {{will have}} been designed and selected for its talismanic, religious or personal significance. A gold amulet pendant, intended for suspension around the neck (and with parallels including one from York), was filled with sulphur, possibly because of its apotropaic qualities. One ring is set with an engraved gem of brown chalcedony 13 x 9.5mm. Upon it is depicted a cock-headed, snake-legged deity known as an Anguipede, holding a shield which is inscribed in Greek with ΩΑΙ, ΙΑΩ or 'Iao' in reverse - a powerful magical word often associated with this deity (see Voces mysticae). Although set in a closed-back setting, this gem was also inscribed on its reverse side with the Greek ΑΒΡΑϹΞϹΑΒΑΩΘ which translates as 'Abrasax Sabaoth' also a word of power and associated name of the deity. It <b>is</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> a Greek-inscribed charm appears in a hoard primarily associated with an Italian (Latin) minor deity (Faunus), though many other Greek inscriptions are known from Roman Britain, and other examples of late-Antique 'magical gems' have also been found in Latin-speaking provinces.|$|E

50|$|One reason <b>that</b> PVS <b>are</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they {{classify}} generic {{objects that}} arise in G-invariant situations. For example, if G=GL(7), then the above tables show that there are generic 3-forms under the action of G, and the stabilizer of such a 3-form is isomorphic to the exceptional Lie group G2.|$|R

500|$|Stephen Holden of The New York Times {{criticized the}} {{contract}} amount, considering it a gamble for Virgin. He stated that Jackson [...] "is a producer-dependent artist—i.e., someone who relies on others {{to make her}} sound interesting and trendy. She also lacks a sharply defined personality, both {{as an artist and}} celebrity. Where singers like Ms. Houston and Mariah Carey have commanding vocal power, Ms. Jackson's is a relatively indistinguishable studio voice." [...] Richard Branson rebutted this argument stating [...] "Ms. Jackson has met with great success working with the production team of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, just as her brother Michael Jackson has experienced his greatest successes with the producer Quincy Jones. It <b>is</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Holden doesn't mention this similar 'liability' when discussing Michael Jackson. To say that Ms. Jackson is 'dependent' on her producer is a shortsighted observation. She is a formidable talent who stands on her own." [...] Michael Jackson would break his sister's record only days later, when he signed a $60 million contract with Sony Music Entertainment. Both sibling's contracts garnered considerable criticism. Los Angeles Times reported that [...] "A Records President Al Cafaro, whose company lost the fierce bidding battle over Janet Jackson to Virgin Records, said record companies may be vesting too much importance in individual performers" [...] as the funds used as advances to the Jacksons could have launched recording careers for numerous unknown talents. Cliff Burnstein of Q-Prime [...] management commented that recording artists demands for advances upon signing would begin to escalate from that point forward.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{configuration}} {{was first introduced}} to give a characterization for the amenability of groups.
