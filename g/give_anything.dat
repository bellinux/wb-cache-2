Before he can do so, Rudolph {{declares}} that he would <b>give</b> <b>anything</b> to avoid being blown up the next day, and Ludwig sees a way out.

Although Rudolph is sceptical, he accepts Ludwig's proposal.|$|E

500|$|Butler {{announced}} on 6 March 1963 {{that he was}} going to convene a conference to decide the Federation's future. It would be impossible (or at least very difficult) for Britain to dissolve the union without Southern Rhodesia's co-operation as the latter, being self-governing, had been co-signatory to the Federal agreement in 1953. According to Smith, Field, Dupont and other RF politicians, Butler made several oral independence guarantees to ensure Southern Rhodesia's attendance and support at the conference, but repeatedly refused to <b>give</b> <b>anything</b> on paper. Field and Smith claimed that Butler justified this to them the day before the conference began by saying that binding Whitehall to a document rather than his word would be against the Commonwealth's [...] "spirit of trust"—an argument that Field eventually accepted. [...] "Let's remember the trust you emphasised," [...] Smith warned, according to Field's account wagging his finger at Butler; [...] "if you break that you will live to regret it." [...] No minutes were made of this meeting. Butler denied afterwards that he had ever made such a promise. Southern Rhodesia attended the conference, held at the Victoria Falls Hotel over a week starting from 28 June 1963, and among other things it was agreed to formally liquidate the Federation at the end of 1963.|$|E
500|$|As Southern Rhodesia {{had been}} the UK's {{legislative}} partner in forming the Federation in 1953, {{it would be impossible}} (or at least very difficult) for Britain to dissolve the union without Southern Rhodesia's co-operation. Field could therefore potentially hamstring the British by refusing to attend the conference until they pledged to grant his country full independence. According to Field, Smith and other RF politicians, Butler made several such guarantees orally to ensure their co-operation at the conference, but repeatedly refused to <b>give</b> <b>anything</b> on paper. The Southern Rhodesians claimed that Butler justified his refusal to give a written promise by saying that binding Whitehall to a document rather than his word would be against the Commonwealth's [...] "spirit of trust"—an argument that Field eventually accepted.

500|$|Veronica is kissing Leo D'Amato (Max Greenfield) {{outside her}} house. After Veronica {{goes back into}} her house, Keith announces that he has begun dating Wallace's (Percy Daggs III) mother, Alicia, making things awkward between Veronica and Wallace. Veronica notices a sign outside which says [...] "KillemAll.net". In class, there is a fire drill, and Duncan (Teddy Dunn) {{says that it is}} the third one this week. Veronica talks to Principal Clemmons about the fire drill issue, but he doesn't <b>give</b> <b>anything</b> up to her. Later, she notices police {{officers}} with service dogs going through the building. Veronica, posing as the superintendent, calls Principal Clemmons, who reveals that the school has experienced several bomb threats. She prints the story in the school newspaper, causing chaos at school the next day. Principal Clemmons calls her in again and tells her to stop printing stories. Veronica and Wallace talk to each other while Keith and Alicia watch a movie. Alicia tries to convince Wallace to accept their relationship to no avail. After talking to Mac (Tina Majorino), another student, Pete (Michael McMillian) approaches Veronica to say that he saw two students, Ben (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) and Norris (Theo Rossi) with exploding tennis balls. Wallace places the two students under more suspicion when he tells Veronica about them, and Veronica sees a mysterious timer.|$|E
500|$|The Giants {{controlled}} the 49ers throughout the game, and with four minutes {{left in the}} third quarter held a 38–14 lead, which would have been even larger had not Shockey dropped a touchdown pass in the third quarter. The 49ers rallied however, scoring a field goal and three touchdowns—two on Jeff Garcia touchdown passes, one on a Garcia 14-yard touchdown run, and two two-point conversions made by Terrell Owens—which gave the 49ers a 39–38 lead with a minute to go. Collins then drove the Giants down to the 49ers 23-yard line with six seconds to play, setting up a 41-yard potential game-winning field goal attempt by Matt Bryant. However, Bryant never got an opportunity to make the kick. 40-year-old long snapper Trey Junkin—who had been signed out of retirement for this playoff game—snapped the ball low and punter Matt Allen could not spot the ball for the attempt. With no other options, Allen threw it downfield to offensive lineman Rich Seubert. The Giants were penalized for an illegal man downfield (Seubert), and the game was over. However, after the game, the NFL recognized that San Francisco should have been penalized on that play as well for pass interference. This would have created offsetting penalties and given New York a chance to kick again. After the game a devastated Junkin said [...] "I cost 58 guys a chance to go to the Super Bowl. I'd <b>give</b> <b>anything</b> in the world, except my family at this point, right now to still be retired." ...|$|E
500|$|By 2001, {{the project}} had become {{stranded}} in development hell. In a Q panel at Comic-Con 2007, Gaiman remarked, [...] "I'd rather see no Sandman movie made than a bad Sandman movie. But I {{feel like the}} time for a Sandman movie is coming soon. We need someone who has the same obsession with the source material as Peter Jackson had with Lord of the Rings or Sam Raimi had with Spider-Man." [...] That same year, he stated that he could imagine Terry Gilliam as a director for the adaptation: [...] "I would always <b>give</b> <b>anything</b> to Terry Gilliam, forever, so if Terry Gilliam ever wants to do Sandman then as far as I'm concerned Terry Gilliam should do Sandman." [...] In 2013, DC President Diane Nelson said that a Sandman film would be as rich as the Harry Potter universe. David S. Goyer announced in an interview in early December that he would be producing an adaptation of the graphic novel, alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Neil Gaiman. Jack Thorne was hired to write the script. On October 16, 2014, Gaiman clarified that while the film was not announced with the DC slate by Warner Bros., it would instead be distributed by Vertigo and announced with those slate of films. Goyer told Deadline.com in an interview that the studio was very happy with the film's script. According to Deadline.com, the film was to be distributed by New Line Cinema. In October 2015, Goyer revealed that a new screenwriter was being brought on board to revise the script by Jack Thorne and stated that he believed the film would go into production the following year. In March 2016, The Hollywood Reporter revealed that Eric Heisserer was hired to rewrite the film's script. The next day, Gordon-Levitt announced that he had dropped out due to disagreements with the studio over the creative direction of the film. On November 9, 2016, i09 reported that Heisserer had turned in his draft of the script but left the film, stating that the film should be an HBO series instead.|$|E

2500|$|A {{spokesman}} for the Canadian Taxpayers Federation has criticized the CAW's [...] "no-concession" [...] stance, saying that it only serves to strengthen the opposition to a taxpayer-funded bailout for the struggling Detroit Three automakers.

Kelly McParland, a columnist for the National Post, has suggested that [...] "if he won't <b>give</b> <b>anything,</b> he and his members are likely to lose everything." [...] He also said that the problem facing the North American auto industry was borne equally by management and labour alike, criticizing labour for building up pay and benefits for themselves that was as unsustainable as it was enviable, while attacking management for its short-term strategy of selling gas-guzzling trucks and sales tactics (price cuts, rebates, free gas and cash-back schemes).|$|E
