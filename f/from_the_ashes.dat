5|$|On 17 September 1997, a new film, This Brick, was premiered. The film {{consisted}} of one three-minute {{shot of a}} brick made <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ashes</b> of the money burnt at Jura. It was shown at the Barbican Centre prior to Drummond and Cauty's performance as 2K.|$|E
5|$|Several documentaries and docudramas {{have covered}} {{the history of}} the eruption, {{including}} archive footage and dramatisations of Johnston's story.

The {{location}} for the new chapel was chosen for two reasons: symbolically, the new chapel would rise <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ashes</b> of the old one, and practically, it would locate the new chapel centrally as the campus expanded eastward.|$|E

5|$|In 1862 Troy {{suffered}} {{another major}} fire, {{the worst in}} its history. A locomotive's spark ignited the wooden Green Island drawbridge that existed at the time, and when {{that could not be}} contained to the bridge it spread to the east, ultimately devastating 507 buildings over a 16-block area. As before, the city rebuilt quickly, with the area along Fifth between Broadway and Grant Street, where Cummings built a row of houses between Fifth and Sixth, most strongly reflecting this era of rapid construction and reconstruction. The Gurley Building, too, rose in just eight months <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ashes</b> of its predecessor. The nearby neighborhood also became desirable, with many local businessmen moving into newly built homes along Fifth.|$|E
5|$|Following Napoleon's {{defeat in}} 1814 and 1815, the reactionary Congress of Vienna {{determined}} {{that all of}} Europe should consist of strong monarchies (with the exception of Switzerland and a few insignificant republics). In France, the Bourbon dynasty was restored, replaced by the liberal July Monarchy in 1830, before the entire monarchy was again abolished during the Revolutions of 1848. The popular Napoleon III was able to proclaim himself Emperor in 1852, thus founding the Second French Empire. The kingdoms of Sicily and Naples ("Two Sicilies") were absorbed into the kingdom of Sardinia to form the Kingdom of Italy in 1861. Austria and Prussia vied to unite all German states under their banner, with Prussia emerging victorious in 1866. It succeeded in provoking Napoleon III to declare war, defeat France and absorb the southern German states into the German Empire in the process (1870–71). <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>ashes</b> of the Second Empire rose the French Third Republic, the only great republican European power until World War I.|$|E
5|$|Jenni is {{disturbed}} both by Mickey's {{belief that}} Marion's ghost wanders the estate and by Marion's self-portrait inside the house, which Jenni believes resembles her mother. When {{she begins to}} hear unexplained screaming noises and see skulls around her house, she believes that Marion is haunting her. Though Eric speculates to Jenni that Mickey, who was a childhood friend of Marion and thus dislikes Jenni, may be behind the trickery, Jenni worries that she is going insane. Eric suggests to remove Marion's self-portrait from the home. Eric and Jenni take the painting outside and burn it. While they clean up {{the remains of the}} painting, a skull emerges <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ashes.</b> Jenni panics {{at the sight of the}} skull, but Eric denies that the skull is there. Jenni faints and Eric withdraws the skull and hides it, revealing that he has been gaslighting her all along.|$|E

5|$|With retirements of both Woodfull and Ponsford {{following}} the 1934 tour to England, {{positions at the}} top of the Australia's batting order became available. Fingleton also found state cricket more attractive now that Bradman had decided to move to South Australia to take up stockbroking. Fingleton responded to his omission <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ashes</b> tour by leading the run-scoring aggregates in the 1934–35 season. He scored 880 runs at 58.66 with four centuries and four fifties, almost 200 runs more than the second most prolific batsman, Brown. After Fingleton started the summer with a fifty in Woodfull's testimonial match, the pair started the Shield campaign with a 249-run stand in New South Wales' first match of the season against South Australia, both scoring centuries in an innings victory. Fingleton made 134 in just over three hours. Fingleton reached 49 at least once in the remaining five matches, including a 108 against Queensland. Despite the form of the openers, New South Wales failed to win the Sheffield Shield after losing both of their matches against Victoria. Fingleton ended the season with consecutive centuries, 124 and 100, against Western Australia, and took the first of two first-class wickets in his career in the first of the two matches.|$|E

25|$|After a {{disastrous}} fire leveled {{much of the}} downtown core in 1904, the fledgling municipal government passed an ordinance requiring all buildings {{in the area to}} be built of 'fireproof' materials like brick and stone. Consequently, a new city centre rose <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ashes</b> sporting brick buildings along broad avenues that would have looked more at home in a sedate and refined Victorian city than a rough-and-tumble frontier coal town. They were short-lived, however, as a second, larger inferno swept through the city on August 1, 1908. Whipped up by sudden winds, a nearby forest fire burnt its way into a lumber yard {{on the edge of the}} community and sparked a Dresden-style firestorm that melted brick and mortar and essentially erased the entire city in an afternoon. There were few casualties, however, and for a second time a stately brick downtown core rose <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ashes.</b> Today, these historic buildings, most of which still stand, are a treasured and distinctive feature of the community.|$|E
