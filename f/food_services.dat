40|$|The U. S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the U. S.

Those guidelines, Health and Sustainability Guidelines for Federal Concessions and Vending Operations, (referred to here as the 2011 HHS/GSA Guidelines) have been updated and renamed, <b>Food</b> <b>Service</b> Guidelines for Federal Facilities. Updates to the <b>Food</b> <b>Service</b> Guidelines for Federal Facilities primarily include the following: 1) alignment of food and nutrition standards with the 201522 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 8 th Edition (referred to here as the 201522 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 2020 Dietary Guidelines); 2) alignment with Executive Order 13693 (Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade) on energy efficiency and environmental performance; 3) additions of food safety standards aligned with the Food Code to ensure protection against foodborne illnesses; and 4) behavioral design strategies for encouraging selection of healthier foods and beverages. The purpose of the <b>Food</b> <b>Service</b> Guidelines for Federal Facilities is to provide specific standards for food, nutrition, facility efficiency, environmental support, community development, food safety, and behavioral design for use in <b>food</b> <b>service</b> concession and vending operations at federal facilities; examples include cafeterias, cafe?s, snack bars, grills, concession stands, sundry shops, micro markets, and vending machines. The <b>Food</b> <b>Service</b> Guidelines for Federal Facilities is to be used primarily for developing contracts and permits for the delivery of <b>food</b> <b>service</b> in these settings. The intended audiences for this document are federal acquisition officials and staff who develop requests for <b>food</b> <b>service</b> proposals and negotiate contracts; <b>food</b> <b>service</b> vendors competing for federal <b>food</b> <b>service</b> contracts; participants in the Randolph-Sheppard Vending Facility Program; 22 ̆ 0 ac 02 and persons who monitor or advise <b>food</b> <b>service</b> operations, such as worksite wellness stakeholders or contracting officers. The guidelines in this document may also {{serve as a model for}} concession and vending operations at state, local, and tribal government and private worksite facilities. Two types of <b>food</b> <b>service</b> are provided in federal facilities. One type includes <b>food</b> <b>service</b> venues in which food is sold (such as cafeterias, cafe?s, and vending machines) and customers purchase their food and beverages from a variety of choices. The other type includes venues in which food is served (such as federal hospitals, correction facilities, or military dining facilities), and the government is responsible for providing individuals with meals that meet all or part of their daily or weekly nutrition needs and individual choice may be limited. With the exception of the food safety standards, which apply in both types of venues, the standards in the <b>Food</b> <b>Service</b> Guidelines for Federal Facilities are written specifically for federal <b>food</b> <b>service</b> venues where <b>food</b> is sold (although they can be adapted to venues where food is served).
