5|$|Two days later, the {{starboard}} propshaft seal sprung a major leak in the after engine room. A makeshift locking clamp was jury-rigged {{to contain the}} leak. On 12 March, the trouble-plagued fathometer ceased operation when its transducer header flooded, grounding out the entire system. Since the transducer head was located outside the boat's pressure hull, {{it could not be}} repaired except in drydock. Without an operational fathometer, Triton could be vulnerable to grounding or collision with uncharted submerged formations. It was subsequently determined that the cabling to the Tritons fathometer head, located in the bulbous <b>forefoot</b> of her bow, had not been properly insulated, and the constant buffeting from Tritons high speed caused these cables to rupture, rendering the fathometer inoperable.|$|E
5|$|Saddlebreds are {{popularly known}} as show horses, with horses being shown saddle seat in both three-gaited and five-gaited classes. The former are the three common gaits seen in most breeds, the walk, trot and canter. The latter {{includes}} the three regular gaits, plus two four-beat ambling gaits known as the slow gait and the rack. The slow gait today is a four-beat gait in which the lateral pairs of legs leave the ground together, but strike the ground at different times, the hind foot connecting slightly before the <b>forefoot.</b> In the show ring, the gait should be performed with restraint and precision. The rack is also a four-beat gait, but with equal intervals between each footfall, making it a smooth gait to ride. In the show ring, the gait is performed with speed and action, appearing unrestrained. Historically, the slow gait could be either a running walk, the stepping pace, or the fox trot, however, the modern five-gaited Saddlebred usually performs the stepping pace.|$|E

40|$|The kind of mole {{found in}} Kansas is the eastern mole, Scalopus aquaticus. Moles are small, mouse-sized mammals adapted to living underground. They are {{characterized}} by enlarged <b>forefeet</b> with long claws, stout necks and powerful shoulders which make them capable burrowers.

25|$|In most phalangerid {{marsupials}} (a {{family of}} possums) except species Trichosurus and Wyulda {{the first and}} second digits of the <b>forefoot</b> are opposable to the other three. In the hind foot, the first toe is clawless but opposable and provides firm grip on branches. The second and third toes are partly syndactylous, united by skin at the top joint while the two separate nails serve as hair combs. The fourth and fifth digits are the largest of the hind foot.|$|E
25|$|Plantar flexion: One of {{the most}} popular lower leg muscle {{stretches}} is the step standing heel raises, which mainly involves the gastrocnemius, soleus, and the Achilles tendon. Standing heel raises allow the individual to activate their calf muscles by standing on a step with toes and <b>forefoot,</b> leaving the heel hanging off the step, and plantar flexing the ankle joint by raising the heel. This exercise is easily modified by holding on to a nearby rail for balance and is generally repeated 5-10 times.|$|E
25|$|Pressure wounds {{are often}} the result of local {{ischemia}} from the increased pressure. Increased pressure also plays a roles in many diabetic foot ulcerations as changes due to the disease causes the foot to suffer limited joint mobility and creates pressure points {{on the bottom of}} the foot. Effective measures to treat this includes a surgical procedure called the gastrocnemius recession in which the calf muscle is lengthened to decrease the fulcrum created by this muscle and resulting in a decrease in plantar <b>forefoot</b> pressure.|$|E
50|$|It is {{predominantly}} insectivorous but also carnivorous. Insects and other arthropoda such as spiders are {{caught on the}} ground and then held down with the <b>forefeet</b> and eaten. Larger prey such as rodents are stalked and killed with a bite to the head. Large prey items are held down with the <b>forefeet</b> and then torn into bite size pieces with the teeth.|$|R
5000|$|Occasionally, only trackways {{from the}} <b>forefeet</b> are found. Falkingham et al. [...] used {{computer}} modelling {{to show that}} this could be due to the properties of the substrate. These need to be just right to preserve tracks. Differences in hind limb and fore limb surface area, and therefore contact pressure with the substrate, may sometimes lead to only the <b>forefeet</b> trackways being preserved.|$|R

25|$|Epidemiological studies {{looking at}} the most common {{injuries}} that affect fast bowlers found that 11% of injuries involve the foot and the ankle. Majority of the injuries to the feet and ankles of fast bowlers {{are a result of}} the impact of the foot planted in the delivery stride. A bowler who's <b>forefoot</b> in their delivery stride is a plantar flex action can cause posterior impingement. After long durations this plantar flexion can lead to the creation of a bone spur which can then be treated through surgery.|$|E
25|$|The limb {{bones of}} Barosaurus were {{virtually}} indistinguishable {{from those of}} Diplodocus. Both were quadrupedal, with columnar limbs adapted to support the enormous bulk of the animals. Barosaurus had proportionately longer forelimbs than other diplodocids, although they were still shorter than most other groups of sauropods. There was a single carpal bone in the wrist, and the metacarpals were more slender than those of Diplodocus. Barosaurus feet have never been discovered, but like other sauropods, {{it would have been}} digitigrade, with all four feet each bearing five small toes. A large claw adorned the inside digit on the manus (<b>forefoot)</b> while smaller claws tipped the inside three digits of the pes (hindfoot).|$|E

5000|$|Sauropod trackways {{and other}} fossil {{footprints}} (known as [...] "ichnites") are known from abundant evidence present on most continents. Ichnites have helped support other biological hypotheses about sauropods, including general fore and hind foot anatomy (see Limbs and feet above). Generally, prints from the <b>forefeet</b> are {{much smaller than}} the hind feet, and often crescent-shaped. Occasionally ichnites preserve traces of the claws, and help confirm which sauropod groups lost claws or even digits on their <b>forefeet.</b>|$|R
60|$|The burros {{appeared}} lazy, yet willing. But the mustangs and {{the mule}} Withers called Red and the gray mare Dynamite were {{determined not to}} be driven into camp. It was astonishing how much action they had, how much ground they could cover with their <b>forefeet</b> hobbled together. They were exceedingly skilful; they lifted both <b>forefeet</b> at once, and then plunged. And they all went in different directions. Nas Ta Bega darted in here and there to head off escape.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to its diet, and unlike the giant anteater, the northern tamandua is also adapted to an arboreal lifestyle. The muscles of the toes {{and the presence of}} a tough pad on the palms makes the <b>forefeet</b> prehensile, enabling them to grip onto projections as it climbs. The middle toe of the <b>forefeet</b> also bears an unusually large claw, and the toe has enough muscle and leverage to allow it to rip open wood to get at the ants within.|$|R

500|$|At {{the time}} of her construction, Triton was the largest {{submarine}} ever built. Her knife-like bow, with its bulbous <b>forefoot,</b> provided improved surfaced sea-keeping for her radar picket role. Her surface sea-keeping was further enhanced by high reserve buoyancy (30%), provided by 22 ballast tanks, the most ever in an American submarine. She was the last submarine to have a conning tower, as well as the last American submarine to have twin screws or a stern torpedo room. [...] Her sail was the largest ever aboard an American submarine, measuring [...] long, [...] tall, and [...] wide, and designed to house the large AN/SPS-26 3-D air-search radar antenna when not in use.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Left-right {{symmetrical}} distal limb conformation can be {{an important}} prerequisite for a successful performance, and it is often hypothesized that asymmetric or uneven feet are important enhancing factors for the development of lameness. On a population level, it has been demonstrated that uneven footed horses are retiring earlier from elite level competition, but the biomechanical consequences are not yet known. The objectives of this study were to compare the functional locomotor asymmetries of horses with uneven to those with even feet. Hoof kinetics and distal limb kinematics were collected from horses (n = 34) at trot. Dorsal hoof wall angle was used to classify horses as even or uneven (1. 5 ° difference between <b>forefeet</b> respectively) and individual feet as flat (55 °). Functional kinetic parameters were compared between even and uneven <b>forefeet</b> using MANOVA followed by ANOVA. The relative influences of differences in hoof angle between the <b>forefeet</b> and of absolute hoof angle on functional parameters were analysed using multiple regression analysis (P< 0. 05). In horses with uneven feet, the side with the flatter foot showed a significantly larger maximal horizontal braking and vertical ground reaction force, a larger vertical fetlock displacement and a suppler fetlock spring. The foot with a steeper hoof angle was linearly correlated with an earlier braking-propulsion transition. The conformational differences between both <b>forefeet</b> were more important for loading characteristics than the individual foot conformation of each individual horse. The differences in vertical force and braking force between uneven <b>forefeet</b> could imply either an asymmetrical loading pattern without a pathological component or a subclinical lameness {{as a result of a}} pathological development in the steeper foot...|$|R

500|$|The Lexington-class ships had {{an overall}} length of , {{a beam of}} , and a draft of [...] They {{displaced}} [...] at normal load and [...] at deep load. Because the demand for extreme speed necessitated a long hull with maximum freeboard, the forecastle was extended down 75 {{percent of the total}} length of the hull. For this class, Rear Admiral David W. Taylor, who served as Chief Constructor for the Bureau of Construction and Repair, used a relatively new kind of bow called the bulbous bow or Taylor bow. The result of a series of towing tests begun in 1910, this bow reduced water resistance by an average of six percent, supported the forecastle and reduced bending stress on the hull. At speeds of more than 25 knots, test results were highly favorable. A disadvantage was the formation of a heavy layer of water which would creep up along the outer plating of the forecastle at higher speeds. However, this tendency could be reduced to some degree by careful design of the frames. Taylor first introduced this bow, also known as a bulbous <b>forefoot,</b> in his design of , which entered service in 1910.|$|E

[...] His ideas included a slanting clipper-like bow and a bulbous <b>forefoot</b> beneath the waterline, in combination with a slim hydrodynamic hull. Yourkevitch's concepts worked wonderfully in scale models, confirming his design's performance advantages. The French engineers were impressed and asked Yourkevitch to join their project. Reportedly, he also approached Cunard with his ideas, but was rejected because the bow was deemed too radical.|$|E
