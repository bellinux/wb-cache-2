5|$|Amman has extreme {{examples}} of microclimate, {{and almost every}} district exhibits its own weather. It is known among locals that some boroughs such as the northern suburb of Abu Nser are among the coldest in the city, and can be experiencing frost while other warmer districts such as Marka can be providing much warmer temperatures to <b>its</b> <b>inhabitants</b> at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Between 1025 and 1028, the Fatimids {{reached an}} {{agreement}} with Salih's Jarrahid/Tayyi allies, allowing them to maintain their foothold in interior Palestine, while Anushtakin was recalled to Cairo. In contrast to the Mirdasids, the Tayy consistently plundered their territory and <b>its</b> <b>inhabitants.</b> Moreover, the Fatimids would not tolerate independent rule in Palestine, which they viewed {{as a threat to}} the Caliphate's survival.|$|E
5|$|Chiswick {{grew up as}} {{a village}} around St Nicholas Church from c. 1181 on Church Street, <b>its</b> <b>inhabitants</b> practising farming, fishing and other {{riverside}} trades including a ferry, important as there were no bridges between London Bridge and Kingston throughout the Middle Ages. The area included three other small settlements, the fishing village of Strand-on-the-Green, Little Sutton and Turnham Green on the west road out of London.|$|E

5|$|Greek {{territory}} and <b>its</b> <b>inhabitants,</b> the Achaeans, {{one of the}} names that Homer {{used to refer to}} the Greeks in the Iliad. Historically important about the Achaeans in the time of Attarsiya is that they undertook an expedition to Anatolia, as well as Cyprus. The latter expedition indicates that the Achaean leader commanded a significant fleet and that the Achaeans were a sea power.|$|E
5|$|In autumn 964, Nikephoros, now emperor, campaigned in the East. Mopsuestia was besieged {{but held}} out, but Nikephoros {{returned}} {{in the next}} year, stormed the city and deported <b>its</b> <b>inhabitants.</b> On 16 August 965, Tarsus was surrendered by <b>its</b> <b>inhabitants.</b> Cilicia became a Byzantine province, and Nikephoros re-Christianized it. Amidst rebellions and Byzantine raids {{as far as the}} Jazira, Sayf al-Dawla died at Aleppo in February 967. His son and successor, Sa'd al-Dawla, faced constant internal turmoil, and he did not secure control of his own capital until 977. By this time, the rump Emirate of Aleppo was almost powerless and became a bone of contention between the Byzantines and the new power of the Middle East, the Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt.|$|E
5|$|In the {{penultimate}} {{panel of}} the book, as Tintin, Haddock and Calculus's flight back home departs from the newly named Alcazaropolis, it flies over a slum that was seen earlier when they flew into the country.

30|$|Transport {{infrastructures}} {{are also}} {{seen as a}} means to contribute to smarter a city and provide <b>its</b> <b>inhabitant</b> with a better quality of life.

5|$|Pym and Peters {{hide in the}} {{mountains}} surrounding {{the site of the}} ambush. They discover a labyrinth of passages in the hills with strange marks on the walls, and disagree about whether these are the result of artificial or natural causes. Facing a shortage of food, they make a desperate run and steal a pirogue from the natives, narrowly escaping from the island and taking one of <b>its</b> <b>inhabitants</b> prisoner.|$|E
5|$|The Dominicans {{established}} {{themselves in}} Xocolo {{on the shore}} of Lake Izabal in the mid-16th century.

5|$|After the expedition, the {{independent}} country of Darfur, and <b>its</b> <b>inhabitants,</b> {{became part of}} Sudan. The £500,000 bill {{for the cost of}} the expedition was sent to the Egyptian Government in Cairo for payment by the Egyptian taxpayers. The British commanders of the operation were also recognised. In 1917, Wingate became the British High Commissioner for Egypt. The commander of the Anglo-Egyptian expedition, Kelly, became the first Governor of the Darfur province with his office located in the Sultan's palace throne room until May 1917. He was then promoted to brigadier general and given command of the 5th Mounted Brigade, which was part of the Australian Mounted Division fighting in Palestine.|$|E

5|$|Balzac uses meticulous, {{abundant}} {{detail to}} describe the Maison Vauquer, <b>its</b> <b>inhabitants,</b> and the world around them; this technique gave rise to his title {{as the father of}} the realist novel. The details focus mostly on the penury of the residents of the Maison Vauquer. Much less intricate are the descriptions of wealthier homes; Madame de Beauséant's rooms are given scant attention, and the Nucingen family lives in a house sketched in the briefest detail.|$|E
