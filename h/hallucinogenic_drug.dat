5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the 40 Watt Club became a {{well-known}} regional attraction for music fans, and {{was followed by}} the Uptown Lounge; with the local industry's growth in the 1980s, both the 40 Watt Club and the Uptown Lounge moved to larger spaces, the latter taking over the landmark Georgia Theatre. The early 1980s saw a host of new bands and venues appear, while the city's musical subculture became more diversified. LSD, a <b>hallucinogenic</b> <b>drug,</b> was widely used in the college music scene in this era. Many members of Athens's most prominent later bands became locally renowned starting in the 1970s, including The B-52's.|$|E
5|$|A {{follow-up}} study conducted 14 {{months after the}} original psilocybin session confirmed that participants continued to attribute deep personal meaning to the experience. Almost one-third of the subjects reported that the experience was the single most meaningful or spiritually significant event of their lives, and over two-thirds reported it among their five most spiritually significant events. About two-thirds indicated that the experience increased their sense of well-being or life satisfaction. Even after 14 months, those who reported mystical experiences scored on average 4 percentage points higher on the personality trait of Openness/Intellect; personality traits are normally stable across the lifespan for adults. Likewise, in a recent (2010) web-based questionnaire study designed to investigate user perceptions of the {{benefits and harms of}} <b>hallucinogenic</b> <b>drug</b> use, 60% of the 503 psilocybin users reported that their use of psilocybin had a long-term positive impact on their sense of well-being.|$|E

This weakness {{is often used to}} immobilize Daredevil. Alternately, the lack of taste or smell of certain substances can be used against him, as in one instance of a <b>hallucinogenic</b> <b>drug</b> designed so that Daredevil could not tell he was drugged. His senses are highly acute, capable of sensing the minor atmospheric disturbance created moments before a teleporting character appears.|$|E

Two other candidates in British Columbia who were proponents of marijuana decriminalization— Dana Larsen and Kirk Tousaw— resigned earlier after videos they had produced for Internet site Pot-TV were released to the media. One of the videos, filmed in 2000, showed Mr. Larsen, former leader of the BC Marijuana Party, preparing to light up a joint before driving a car, after having taken the short-acting <b>hallucinogenic</b> <b>drug</b> DMT earlier in the evening.|$|E
25|$|Conspiring {{with his}} mentor Gilliam and second-in-command Edgar, Curtis Everett plans {{to lead the}} tail {{passengers}} in a revolt that will take {{them all the way}} up to the engine. Mason and armed guards come to take two small children, Andy and Timmy. Andy's father Andrew attempts to fight back, but is punished by Mason by being forced to put his arm into the extreme cold outside the train, effectively amputating it. Enraged, Curtis initiates their plan the next time they are to be fed, taking the security and prison cars. Curtis releases security expert Namgoong Minsu and his clairvoyant daughter Yona from the prison car so he can disable the locks between cars, offering them a <b>hallucinogenic</b> <b>drug</b> called Kronole as payment. They take the car where insects are ground up to make their protein bars, and Gilliam suggests that if they take the subsequent water supply car, they will control any negotiation with Wilford. Instead, they are ambushed by a mass of masked men with hatchets led by Franco the Elder under Mason's orders; after a bloody battle Curtis sacrifices Edgar to win the fight. Mason is taken captive and Curtis, Namgoong, Yona, Tanya, Andrew and Gilliam's bodyguard Grey continue on with her as a hostage.|$|E

500|$|... "It's All Too Much" [...] {{reflects}} George Harrison's {{experimentation with}} the <b>hallucinogenic</b> <b>drug</b> Lysergic acid diethylamide, {{commonly known as}} LSD or [...] "acid". Author Robert Rodriguez describes the track as [...] "gloriously celebratory", with a lyric that conveys [...] "his acid revelations in a childlike way". Rather than the song being purely drug-related, Harrison states in his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, that the [...] "realisations" [...] brought about by his LSD experiences were also applicable to meditation.|$|E
500|$|Typically of {{his songs}} over this period, Harrison was unable to commit to naming the new composition. At {{the start of the}} {{sessions}} for the Beatles' Revolver album, Geoff Emerick, the band's recording engineer, gave the song the working title of [...] "Granny Smith", after the variety of apple. The song was partly inspired by Harrison's experimentation with the <b>hallucinogenic</b> <b>drug</b> LSD, which he credited as a catalyst for increased awareness and his interest in Eastern philosophical concepts. Author Ian MacDonald views the subject matter as [...] "part philosophical" [...] and [...] "part love-song" [...] to Boyd.|$|E
500|$|When writing [...] "I Want to Tell You", Harrison drew {{inspiration}} from his experimentation with the <b>hallucinogenic</b> <b>drug</b> LSD. The lyrics address what he later termed [...] "the avalanche of thoughts that are so hard to write down or say or transmit". In combination with the song's philosophical message, Harrison's stuttering guitar riff and the dissonance he employs in the melody reflect the difficulties of achieving meaningful communication. The recording {{marked the first time}} that McCartney played his bass guitar part after the band had completed the rhythm track for a song, a technique that became common on the Beatles' subsequent recordings.|$|E

500|$|Harrison wrote [...] "It's All Too Much" [...] as {{a celebration}} of his {{experiences}} with the <b>hallucinogenic</b> <b>drug</b> LSD, although he subsequently found the same realisations in Transcendental Meditation and denounced LSD after visiting Haight-Ashbury in August 1967. The song features Hammond organ, which provides the track with a drone-like quality typical of Indian music, electric guitar feedback, and an overdubbed brass section. Largely self-produced by the band, the recording displays an informal approach that contrasts with the discipline of the Beatles' previous work, particularly Sgt. Pepper. The song's sequence in the Yellow Submarine film has been recognised for its adventurousness in conveying a hallucinogenic experience.|$|E
500|$|The {{composition}} {{adheres to}} the pitches of the Indian equivalent of Dorian mode and emulates the khyal vocal tradition of Hindustani classical music. For musical inspiration, Harrison drew {{from the work}} of master sitarist Ravi Shankar, who became his sitar tutor shortly after the recording was completed. In its lyrical themes, [...] "Love You To" [...] is partly a love song to Harrison's wife, Pattie Boyd, while also incorporating philosophical concepts inspired by his experimentation with the <b>hallucinogenic</b> <b>drug</b> LSD. In the context of its release, the song served {{as one of the first}} examples of the Beatles expressing an ideology aligned with that of the emerging counterculture.|$|E
500|$|Harrison and Boyd {{returned}} to England on 22 October, {{and continued to}} adhere to a Hindu-aligned lifestyle of yoga, meditation and vegetarianism at their home in Esher. The education Harrison received in India, particularly regarding the illusory nature of the material world, resonated following his experiences with the <b>hallucinogenic</b> <b>drug</b> LSD (commonly known as [...] "acid") and informed his lyrics to [...] "Within You Without You". Having considered leaving the Beatles {{after the completion of}} their third US tour, on 29 August 1966, he instead gained a philosophical perspective on the effects of the band's international fame. He later attributed [...] "Within You Without You" [...] to his having [...] "fallen under the spell of the country" [...] after experiencing the [...] "pure essence of India" [...] through Shankar's guidance.|$|E

500|$|George Harrison wrote [...] "I Want to Tell You" [...] in {{the early}} part of 1966, the year in which his songwriting matured in terms of subject matter and productivity. As a {{secondary}} composer to John Lennon and Paul McCartney in the Beatles, Harrison began to establish his own musical identity through his absorption in Indian culture, as well as the perspective he gained through his experiences with the <b>hallucinogenic</b> <b>drug</b> lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). According to author Gary Tillery, the song resulted from a [...] "creative surge" [...] that Harrison experienced at the start of 1966. During the same period, the Beatles had been afforded an unusually long time free of professional commitments due to their decision to turn down A Talent for Loving as their third film for United Artists. Harrison used this time to study the Indian sitar and, like Lennon, to explore philosophical issues in his songwriting while preparing to record the band's next album, Revolver.|$|E
500|$|John Locke {{wakes up}} in the jungle and sees a naked Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) run by, but Locke cannot speak. Mr. Eko's (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) stick falls from above nearly hitting him. In the frame of Eko's church, he builds a sweat lodge and convinces Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) to stand guard. Locke takes a <b>hallucinogenic</b> <b>drug</b> and enters the lodge in order to [...] "speak with the Island". There, Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) appears to help him [...] "find [...] way again, so that [...] can bring the family back together". Locke (mutely) apologizes for the day Boone died, and he accepts the apology, however, in a taunting and {{seemingly}} sarcastic manner. Locke's hallucination takes him to Sydney airport. Boone wheels Locke through the airport where he tells him someone is [...] "in serious danger". Locke sees his fellow survivors, and is told by Boone that he must [...] "clean up [...] own mess". Locke finds Eko's stick covered in blood and Boone tells him [...] "they have him, you don't have much time". Upon exiting the sweat lodge he sees a flash of a polar bear. He recovers his ability to speak and tells Charlie {{that he is going}} to save Eko.|$|E
500|$|Concerns {{that some}} of the lyrics in Sgt. Pepper refer to {{recreational}} drug use led to the BBC banning several songs from British radio, such as [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] because of the phrase [...] "I'd love to turn you on", with the BBC claiming that it could [...] "encourage a permissive attitude towards drug-taking." [...] Although Lennon and McCartney denied any drug-related interpretation of the song at the time, McCartney later suggested that the line was deliberately written to ambiguously refer to either illicit drugs or sexual activity. The meaning of [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" [...] became the subject of speculation, as many believed that the song's title was code for the <b>hallucinogenic</b> <b>drug</b> LSD. The BBC banned the track on those grounds. They also banned [...] "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!" [...] because of the lyric, which mentions [...] "Henry the Horse", a phrase that contains two common slang terms for heroin. Fans speculated that Henry the Horse was a drug dealer and [...] "Fixing a Hole" [...] was a reference to heroin use. Others noted lyrics such as [...] "I get high" [...] from [...] "With a Little Help from My Friends", [...] "take some tea" [...] – slang for cannabis use – from [...] "Lovely Rita" [...] and [...] "digging the weeds" [...] from [...] "When I'm Sixty-Four".|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of their debut album, Since I Left You, the Avalanches {{continued}} to produce music and were touring until 2003. At least one track from the album's final cut had begun taking shape in 2000. One of the group's earliest collaborations was with Luke Steele in 2003, creating [...] "tripped out rock 'n' roll" [...] with both Steele and Di Blasi singing. Remnants of this project {{are reflected in the}} track [...] "Colours" [...] (2016). Until the mid-2000s, the group continued producing new music, although there was no coherent theme between the tracks nor any plans for a studio record. Robbie Chater was ill for three years during this time with two auto-immune diseases which left him unable to produce music. He underwent a treatment using ibogaine, a potent <b>hallucinogenic</b> <b>drug.</b> In February 2005, Darren Seltmann said the album was a work-in-progress and described it as [...] "ambient world music". He also stated the album would include both sampling and live music. In August 2006, Modular Recordings issued a press release stating [...] "it's sounding like everything we dared not hope for, and so much more. They've made the record of their lives basically". This was in response to a joke email which had reached the music press, in which Modular claimed it had rejected the group's new album. In January 2007, the band stated via its website that roughly 40tracks were being considered for the record, but no estimated arrival date could be provided. Subsequent announcements and rumors were circulated {{for the next few years}} promising release dates and blaming sample clearance for the album's delay; however no new material was released during this time.|$|E
