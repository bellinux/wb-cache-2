Further, uses of credit and dividends during period of year 2010 and 2012, education level of respondents, experience of entrepreneurship, and training on business management was captured. Other features of <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> included, information on total annual net profits <b>in</b> <b>the</b> SMEs which was calculated by data collected on the net income after tax and total annual sales <b>in</b> SMEs. <b>The</b> data on total amount of capital <b>in</b> <b>the</b> enterprises was collected by calculating the total amount of stock and other assets owned by enterprises.|$|R

William Brennan argued in dissent that the majority's application of precedent was flawed.

2500|$|Although {{all five}} of the {{supervisors}} named <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> had testified at trial that they could continue working with Myers were she to return, the majority had given greater weight to what it held to be Connick's reasonable belief that {{the distribution of the}} questionnaire would adversely affect his authority. [...] "Such extreme deference to the employer's judgment is not appropriate" [...] for public employment, Brennan responded. He pointed to Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, the landmark free-speech case in which the Court had upheld the right of high-school students to wear black armbands to school in protest against the Vietnam War. In that case a majority had held that the school officials' fear that the armbands would be disruptive, without any other evidence, did not justify prohibiting them. He did not see a difference in this case.|$|E
2500|$|... "Taken as a whole," [...] Gordon continued," [...] {{the issues}} {{presented}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> {{relate to the}} effective functioning of the District Attorney's Office and are matters of public importance and concern." [...] He returned to Pickering, which further required a balancing test between Myers' free-speech interests and Connick's interest in the efficient operation of a public agency. A 1974 Fifth Circuit decision offered language that clarified this test: [...] "t is incumbent upon [...] to clearly demonstrate that the employee's conduct substantially and materially interferes with the discharge of duties and responsibilities inherent in [...] employment." [...] For specifics Gordon looked to a 1972 Seventh Circuit decision that had offered four areas where this balance might be considered: confidentiality, discipline and harmonious relations among coworkers, relations between the employee {{and his or her}} superior, {{and the extent to which}} employee speech affected job performance.|$|E
