2500|$|..... There's no {{need for}} an apology. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> {{there was a big}} {{reaction}} to my speech. In order not to cause any misunderstanding, I decided I will no longer use that word. It is regrettable that the word was interpreted in the way it was.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, at his rival's stable, {{throughout}} Preakness week(as late as Friday, the {{day before}} the race), Easy Goer's front feet were being soaked in a tub of Epsom salts due to small scratches or cracks on both heels. An ultrasound was also performed on his ankles and knees. Some wondered if these ailments could compromise the chances of both horses. Easy Goer had [...] "problematic, puffy" [...] ankles that he dealt with throughout his career. Trainer Thad Ackel (trained Breeders' Cup Turf winner Great Communicator) stated, [...] "Easy Goer has got a couple of osselets (enlargements of the fetlock joints usually caused by excess fluid), and it looked to me like there's come calcification there. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> such a good horse could have ankles like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} on February 7, 2010, Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace asked Palin if she supported repeal of [...] "don't ask, don't tell", the United States military policy which restricts efforts to discover or reveal closeted gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members or applicants, while barring those who are openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual from military service. Palin responded, [...] "I don't think so right now. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> the President spent time on that in his State of the Union speech when he only spent about 9 percent {{of his time in}} the State of the Union on national security issues. And I say that because there are other things to be worried about right now with the military. I think that kind of on the back burner is sufficient for now. To put so much time and effort and politics into it– unnecessary." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What {{a splendid}} {{place for a}} ranch home!" [...] {{suggested}} Darry. [...] "Benson, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> there <b>are</b> so few cabins in this neighborhood." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Whatever <b>I</b> <b>am</b> to be, it {{does not}} concern the girls being {{in such a place}} as this. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> you could suffer it." ...|$|R
60|$|Quite {{suddenly}} a {{thought occurred to}} me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> it had not come before {{as a solution to}} our problem. I turned toward Juag.|$|E
6000|$|... "For Heaven's sake, {{leave it}} alone! I asked because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> Lord Arthur should call here. I should have fancied, Clara, that I had made myself {{sufficiently}} clear on that point. Who received him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, major," [...] {{the latter}} said, {{when they came}} into their room, [...] "is it well to tell a Brussian gentleman {{to go to the}} devil? You have much {{offended}} me. Truly <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> you should have so spoken!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Dr. Stanhope. He {{is one of}} our prebendaries--a good, quiet sort of man himself. But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> {{he should}} let his {{daughter}} conduct herself as she does." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} have troubled," [...] said Miss Drewitt, loftily. [...] "It {{is not a matter}} of any consequence. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> my uncle should have thought it worth mentioning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That I," [...] cried Mrs. Pendennis; [...] "people <b>are</b> very impertinent, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure. Mr. Smirke {{came here}} as Arthur's tutor, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> anybody should dare to speak so----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The hell I won't," [...] he retorted, {{with a dark}} glance of passion. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> my remark had angered him. [...] "You fellows are all wrong. I {{know when}} to throw a gun. You ought to {{remember}} that Rangers have a bad name for wanting to shoot. And I'm afraid it's deserved." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have got}} another step?" [...] Harry exclaimed. [...] "I am heartily glad of it. I thought very likely {{you might get}} it. Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> you did not get it, at once, after our fight with the Saxons. I am sure you {{deserved}} it, if ever a fellow did, considering what it saved us all." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{must say}} {{it seemed to}} me the rottenest story I had ever heard, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> Jeeves should have {{considered}} it worth while shoving into a speech. However, when I taxed him with this later, he said that Gussie had altered the plot a good deal, and I dare say that accounts for it.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{these are}} my grandnieces, Elizabeth and Kate, though why Kate I don't know. It is a fanciful name, and new to the family, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> you didn't call her Susanna, after your grandmother." ...|$|R
60|$|The diary {{has cleared}} {{up at least}} one mystery that had puzzled me not a little, and now <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had not guessed its {{solution}} myself--the presence of African and Asiatic beasts in England.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> there, and lingered for {{a quarter}} of an hour or so. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> you did not see me. I did not go past the doorway, however, for undue {{preference}} gives rise to jealousy." ...|$|R
60|$|Having {{heard so}} much of the dirt and vile smells of Cologne, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> our drive took us through streets no way differing from those of most other cities, and, except in the {{vicinity}} of the eleven thousand virgins, smelling no worse. Still, there may be vile, ill-smelling streets; but so there are in Edinburgh, London, and New York.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> {{neither of}} them had {{recognized}} me, for I thought that I was quite sufficiently well known either by personal experience or reputation to every thern upon Barsoom as to make my identity immediately apparent in any part of the planet. In fact, I was the only white man upon Mars whose hair was black and whose eyes were gray, with the exception of my son, Carthoris.|$|E
60|$|But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised,</b> <b>that</b> {{one who had}} {{certainly}} seen much of life, should evince such an incredible ignorance of what was wholly inadmissible in a person situated as he was. But perhaps his familiarity with lofty life, only the less qualified him for understanding the other extreme. Will you believe me, this Bury blade once came on deck in a brocaded dressing-gown, embroidered slippers, and tasseled smoking-cap, to stand his morning watch.|$|E
5000|$|... "Quite frankly, and at {{the same}} time quite respectfully, I can only say <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> the {{question}} should be asked. The idea had not before entered my head that any member of His Majesty's Government had a doubt on the matter." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> the Princess Diana Memorial Fund, {{with all}} its {{millions}} in the bank, did not show a greater interest in this project. I {{believe it to be}} a far more fitting tribute to her work than putting her name on tasteless souvenirs.|$|R
6000|$|Wilson said to himself, [...] "Anybody with a {{reasonably}} good head {{would have thought}} of it. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> Blake didn't detect it; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> only <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> Tom did. There is more to him than I supposed." [...] He said nothing aloud, and Tom went on: ...|$|R
60|$|How {{beautiful}} was the world! How beautiful, but how still! I {{walked slowly}} through the barley towards a line of elder bushes, wayfaring tree and bramble that made the hedge of the field. I noted as I passed along a dead shrew mouse, as it seemed to me, among the halms; then a still toad. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> this did not leap aside from my footfalls, and I stooped and picked it up. Its body was limp like life, but it made no struggle, the brightness of its eye was veiled, it did not move in my hand.|$|E
60|$|Being {{so young}} and inexperienced then, and unconsciously swayed in some degree by those local and social prejudices, that are the marring of most men, and from which, for the mass, there seems no {{possible}} escape; at first <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> a colored man {{should be treated as}} he is in this town; but a little reflection showed that, after all, it was but recognizing his claims to humanity and normal equality; so that, in some things, we Americans leave to other countries the carrying out of the principle that stands at the head of our Declaration of Independence.|$|E
60|$|The Galus {{might be}} a great people in Caspak; but they were pitifully inefficient in even the simpler forms of {{military}} tactics. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> even {{a man of the}} Stone Age should be so lacking in military perspicacity. Du-seen dropped far below par in my estimation as I saw the slovenly formation of his troop as it passed through an enemy country and entered the domain of the chief against whom he had risen in revolt; but Du-seen must have known Jor the chief and known that Jor would not be waiting for him at the pass. Nevertheless he took unwarranted chances. With one squad of a home-guard company I could have conquered Caspak.|$|E
3000|$|We are {{dependent}} on the civil servants … {{because we do not}} have expertise in all areas. But what is important it is that … politicians ask the civil servants so few control questions. … <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> there <b>are</b> so few questions. [37] [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, I think I {{should let}} him return naturally,' said Tancred; 'sending {{for him is}} a scene; and I do not know why, Baroni, but I feel--I feel unstrung. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> there <b>are</b> no letters from England; and yet <b>I</b> <b>am</b> rather glad too, for a letter----' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay, and {{therefore}} more easily played upon,' said the Squire. 'Rome {{is at the bottom}} of it, brother Masham, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> a good Protestant like yourself, one of the King's Justices of the Peace, and a Doctor of Divinity to boot, should doubt the fact for an instant.' ...|$|R
60|$|I had {{my hands}} full with the big, steel-jawed steed I {{was trying to}} hold in. It was the hardest work {{of the kind that}} I had ever undertaken. I had never worn spurs, but now I began to wish for them. We {{traveled}} at a good clip, as fast as the pack-ponies could go, and covered a long distance by camping-time. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> we did not get out of the canyon. The place where we camped was a bare, rocky opening, with a big pool in the center. While we were making camp it suddenly came over me that I was completely bewildered as to our whereabouts. I could not see the mountain peaks and did not know one direction from another. Even when Jim struck out of our trail and went off alone toward Holston I could not form an idea of where I was. All this, however, added to my feeling of the bigness of Penetier.|$|E
6000|$|Boduoc, {{although}} he had objected to the drill at first, and had scoffed {{at the idea of}} men fighting any better because they all kept an even distance from each other, and marched with the same foot forward, had now become an enthusiast in its favour and raged at this falling away. But Beric said, [...] "It is no use being angry, Boduoc. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> they consented at first, and I am not surprised that they have grown tired of it. It is the fault of our people to be fickle and inconstant, soon wearying of anything they undertake; but I do not think that it matters much now. We alone were able to decide the fight when there were but two thousand Roman spearmen; but when we meet Suetonius, he will have ten thousand soldiers under him, and our multitude is so great that the Sarci would be lost in the crowd. If the Britons cannot beat them without us, we should not suffice to change the fortunes of the day." ...|$|E
60|$|From these {{experiments}} {{it is clear}} that the quadrifid and bifid processes have the power of absorbing carbonate and nitrate of ammonia, and matter of some kind from a putrid infusion of meat. Salts of ammonia were selected for trial, as they are known to be rapidly generated by the decay of animal matter in the presence of air and water, and would therefore be generated within the bladders containing captured prey. The effect produced on the processes by these salts and by a putrid infusion of raw meat differs from that produced by the decay of the naturally captured animals only in the aggregated masses of protoplasm being in the latter case of larger size; but it is probable that the fine granules and small hyaline spheres produced by the solutions would coalesce into larger masses, with time enough allowed. [page 416] We have seen with Drosera that the first effect of a weak solution of carbonate of ammonia on the cell-contents is the production of the finest granules, which afterwards aggregate into larger, more or less rounded, masses; and that the granules in the layer of protoplasm which flows round the walls ultimately coalesce with these masses. Changes of this nature are, however, far more rapid in Drosera than in Utricularia. Since the bladders have no power of digesting albumen, cartilage, or roast meat, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> matter was absorbed, at least in one case, from a fresh infusion of raw meat. I was also surprised, from what we shall presently see with respect to the glands round the orifice, that a fresh solution of urea produced only a moderate effect on the quadrifids.|$|E

My uncle tells me you are the best lawyer in the country, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> you <b>are</b> so slow in getting at motives." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{not very}} {{encouraging}} to a new beginner in the occupation of a landlord," [...] I answered; [...] "and, when I look into the facts, <b>I</b> confess, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> so many gentlemen in the colony are willing to invest the sums they annually do in wild lands." ...|$|R
60|$|In 1879, I had a {{translation}} of Dr. Ernst Krause's 'Life of Erasmus Darwin' published, and I added a sketch of his character and habits from material in my possession. Many persons have been much interested by this little life, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> only 800 or 900 copies were sold.|$|R
