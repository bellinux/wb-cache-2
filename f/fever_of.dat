5|$|Gardiner's health {{continued}} {{to be an issue}} throughout the 1934 NHL playoffs. On March 29, 1934 in a playoff game against the Montreal Maroons Gardiner had a shutout as the Black Hawks won 3–0; though he was named first star as the best player of the game, Gardiner was in extreme pain during the entire game with a <b>fever</b> <b>of</b> 102 Fahrenheit and was attended to by a doctor in the dressing room during intermissions.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{symptoms}} {{are similar to}} other viral diseases such as influenza and the common cold: <b>fever</b> <b>of</b> at least , muscle pain, malaise, headache and prostration. As the digestive tract is commonly involved, nausea and vomiting and backache often occur. The prodrome, or preeruptive stage, usually lasts 2–4 days. By days 12–15 the first visible lesions—small reddish spots called enanthem—appear on mucous membranes of the mouth, tongue, palate, and throat, and temperature falls to near normal. These lesions rapidly enlarge and rupture, releasing large amounts of virus into the saliva.|$|E

5|$|During the 1932–33 season Gardiner {{began to}} develop a tonsil {{infection}} that drained his strength. While he initially kept the infection private, Gardiner made his condition public on December 23, 1932. Even though he was ill, Gardiner played the next night in Toronto. Though his fifty-five saves were the deciding factor in the Black Hawks win and his performance was so good that both league President Frank Calder and Maple Leafs star forward Charlie Conacher praised him, he was so sick he would collapse on the dressing room floor in between periods with a <b>fever</b> <b>of</b> over 100 degrees Fahrenheit; after the game Gardiner was rushed to a local hospital.

25|$|Ebola {{virus disease}} (EVD), {{also known as}} Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF) or simply Ebola, is a viral hemorrhagic <b>fever</b> <b>of</b> humans and other {{primates}} caused by ebolaviruses. Signs and symptoms typically start between two days and three weeks after contracting the virus with a fever, sore throat, muscular pain, and headaches. Then, vomiting, diarrhea and rash usually follow, along with decreased function of the liver and kidneys. At this time, some people begin to bleed both internally and externally. The disease has {{a high risk of}} death, killing between 25 and 90 percent of those infected, with an average of about 50 percent. This is often due to low blood pressure from fluid loss, and typically follows six to sixteen days after symptoms appear.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of diphtheria usually begin two {{to seven days}} after infection. Symptoms of diphtheria include <b>fever</b> <b>of</b> 38°C (100.4°F) or above, chills, fatigue, bluish skin coloration (cyanosis), sore throat, hoarseness, cough, headache, difficulty swallowing, painful swallowing, difficulty breathing, rapid breathing, foul-smelling and bloodstained nasal discharge, and lymphadenopathy. Within two to three days, diphtheria may destroy healthy tissues in the respiratory system. The dead tissue forms a thick, gray coating that can build up in the throat or nose. This thick gray coating is called a “pseudomembrane.” It can cover tissues in the nose, tonsils, voice box, and throat, making {{it very hard to}} breathe and swallow. Symptoms can also include cardiac arrhythmias, myocarditis, and cranial and peripheral nerve palsies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Malaria is {{a deadly}} disease which is spread widely in the {{tropical}} {{regions of the world}} with holoendemicity in SubSaharan Africa. An investigation <b>of</b> <b>fever</b> management among mothers of under-five children was carried out in nomadic Fulani settlements of Adamawa State Nigeria. Management <b>of</b> <b>fever</b> was assessed through interviews and questionnaires. Nearly half of the nomadic Fulani mothers (49. 47 %) did not take any action within 24 hours when their children had fever. This was not significantly different (p < 0. 05) with regard to age, clan and parity of the mothers. The duration between mother’s recognition and management <b>of</b> <b>fever</b> showed that almost half (49. 6 %) of the mothers did not take time into consideration during intervention <b>of</b> <b>fever.</b> Mothers <b>of</b> under-five who acted within 24 hours <b>of</b> noticing <b>of</b> <b>fever</b> in their children were 30. 6 %, while those who acted after 24 hours were 12. 0 %. There was no significant difference (p < 0. 05) between mothers recognition <b>of</b> <b>fever</b> and management based on age, clan and parity. Home management <b>of</b> <b>fever</b> by most nomadic Fulani mothers was not satisfactory. Similarly, timely intervention <b>of</b> <b>fever</b> was not considered by most nomadic Fulani mothers.

Symptoms of the disease include <b>fever</b> <b>of</b> , headaches, painful aching joints, nausea and vomiting, and a general feeling of malaise. Left untreated, of those that contract the bubonic plague, 80 per cent die within eight days. Pneumonic plague has a mortality rate of 90 to 95 per cent. Symptoms include fever, cough, and blood-tinged sputum. As the disease progresses, sputum becomes free-flowing and bright red. Septicemic plague is the least common of the three forms, with a mortality rate near 100%. Symptoms are high fevers and purple skin patches (purpura due to disseminated intravascular coagulation).

25|$|The {{dismissal}} fell {{heavily on}} the still vibrant, energetic Konstantin, leaving him adrift without any proper role. He was an enthusiastic chess player and his chess problems were published in international journals, {{but that was not}} a substitute for the position he once had at the center of affairs. He spent increasingly more time with his second family, further humiliating his legitimate wife. With nothing left to do, Konstantin retired to Pavlovsk, spending most of his time abroad or on his Crimean estate of Oreanda. In August 1881 a fire completely destroyed Oreanda. The palace was never rebuilt and Konstantin lived from then on in a wooden pavilion. Tragedy struck him again while living there. In April 1885, his two surviving illegitimate sons died days apart of scarlet <b>fever.</b> <b>Of</b> the five children Constantin had had with Kousnetzova, only the two daughters, Marina and Anna, thrived; Konstantin showered them with affection. He was also particularly close to his eldest daughter Olga whom he visited in Greece in 1883. His grandson Prince Christopher of Greece remembered him for his sharp and loud voice, which Konstantin enjoyed using, usually for new servants and preferably in the presence of guests. Without any reason he would glare at the new servant and then scream the servant's name. Some were used to the trick and remained calm, while others dropped the dishes in terror, which amused him.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare {{actual and}} {{perceived}} causes <b>of</b> <b>fever</b> in northern Tanzania. METHODS: In a standardised survey, {{heads of households}} in 30 wards in Moshi, Tanzania, {{were asked to identify}} the most common cause <b>of</b> <b>fever</b> for children and for adults. Responses were compared to data from a local hospital-based fever aetiology study that used standard diagnostic techniques. RESULTS: Of 810 interviewees, the median (range) age was 48 (16, 102) years and 509 (62. 8 %) were women. Malaria was the most frequently identified cause <b>of</b> <b>fever,</b> cited by 353 (43. 6 %) and 459 (56. 7 %) as the most common cause <b>of</b> <b>fever</b> for children and adults, respectively. In contrast, malaria accounted for 8 (2. 0 %) of adult and 6 (1. 3 %) of paediatric febrile admissions in the fever aetiology study. Weather was the second most frequently cited cause <b>of</b> <b>fever.</b> Participants who identified a non-biomedical explanation such as weather as the most common cause <b>of</b> <b>fever</b> were more likely to prefer a traditional healer for treatment of febrile adults (OR 2. 7, P < 0. 001). Bacterial zoonoses were the most common cause <b>of</b> <b>fever</b> among inpatients, but no interviewees identified infections from animal contact as the most common cause <b>of</b> <b>fever</b> for adults; two (0. 2 %) identified these infections as the most common cause <b>of</b> <b>fever</b> for children. CONCLUSIONS: Malaria is perceived to be a much more common cause <b>of</b> <b>fever</b> than hospital studies indicate, whereas other important diseases are under-appreciated in northern Tanzania. Belief in non-biomedical explanations <b>of</b> <b>fever</b> is common locally and has important public health consequences...|$|R
