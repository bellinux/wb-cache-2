500|$|... "Sexy! No No No..." [...] is an electropunk song, which {{consists}} of three songs welded together, according to journalist Peter Robinson: one with a samba rhythm, one with a sped-up sample and a breakbeat, and an intro from elsewhere. The track opens with Cole singing over a [...] "spooky" [...] instrumentation. Her vocals have been vocodered and she sings [...] "Cause I've been sitting back, no chance of falling / Hoping that nothing ever blows, no no / Boy, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> that loving would be / Nothing more than walking me home, no no". As the chorus begins, the song incorporates a sample from Scottish rock band Nazareth's 1975 track [...] "Hair of the Dog", and the group starts singing, [...] "Did you tell him? No no no / Give him kisses? No no no / Whisper honey? No no no / You're delicious? Hell no". John Murphy of musicOMH noted that [...] "Sexy! No No No.." [...] is not [...] "structured like a proper pop song - there's no verse-chorus-verse". The instrumentation of [...] "Sexy! No No No..." [...] is composed of multi-layered guitar riffs and [...] "euphoric woo woo-oo harmonies", while the song's structure follows as introduction, chorus, chorus, verse, bridge, chorus, middle eight, verse. A Newsround reviewer described the lyrical content, saying that Girls Aloud are [...] "trying {{a different approach to}} getting the guy", in that [...] "instead of being 'sexy', they've backed off." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Your wheel {{does seem}} to be a sort of a companion," [...] she said; [...] "not so good as a horse, but better than nothing.

6000|$|... "Nay, Peterkin," [...] said Jack; [...] "I {{appreciate}} what you say, {{and have no}} doubt whatever that your remarks, if made public, would create quite {{a revolution in the}} juvenile world, and convert them speedily into aquatic animals. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> of sending your views on that subject to the Times?" ...|$|E

Why, you poor, weak-minded, cowardly pet of a blinded old man--you {{conceited}} ass--you selfish an' spoiled boy!... Collie {{never had}} any use for you. An' now she hates you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{would be}} the good of taking Mary? Who is talking of a child like that? It is {{for the sake of}} charity,--for the dear love of Christ, that I ask <b>you</b> to <b>do</b> it. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> of Mary Magdalene?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes; I have {{no doubt}} that you have fifty good excuses, Cashel. But I will not allow any fighting; and you really must work harder. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> of how hard I have to work to pay Dr. Moncrief one hundred and twenty pounds a year for you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Everything is wanted, Harry. Everything is wanted--except that {{check for}} six hundred pounds which you sent me so treacherously. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> {{what might have}} {{happened}} if a certain person had heard of that? All the world would have declared that you had done it for your own private purposes--all the world, except one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bless me, bless me!" [...] exclaimed the worthy mother, [...] "that I {{should live}} ever to see {{paintings}} of such people! Kitty, my dear, this bald-headed {{old man is}} St. Peter. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> that St. Peter was bald!

6000|$|... "I ain't in the {{adopting}} business, Jane," [...] {{he answered}} meekly. [...] "And if I was," [...] with a quaint smile, [...] "I'd adopt {{one or two}} of these nieces o' mine, instead of Tom Bradley's nephew. If Bradley hadn't seen you, Jane, and loved your pretty face when you were young, Kenneth Forbes would now be the owner of Elmhurst. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> of that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} go to my rest," [...] said Madame Staubach, [...] "without doing my duty by seeing you and telling you again, {{that it is very}} wicked of you to leave the room {{whenever}} our friend enters it.

6000|$|... "A word of {{kindness}}! Well; {{what shall}} I say? Every night, as I have lain in my bed, I have said words of kindness to you, since--since--since {{longer than you}} will remember; since I first knew you as a child. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> {{of the day when}} you walked with me round by the bridge?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Warn. Well, sir! for my part, I {{will have}} nothing farther {{to do with}} these women, for, I find, they will be too hard for us; but e'en sit down by the loss, and content myself with my hard fortune: But, madam, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> I will forgive you this, to cheat me into an estate of two {{thousand}} pounds a-year? ...|$|R
60|$|To {{correct the}} false is more {{difficult}} than to imbibe the true. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> of that before? All my life have I been under the false impression that the Cape of Good Hope was the most southerly point of Africa. It is nothing of the sort. Cape Agulhas, not far distant, is the real extremity of South Africa. We doubled it on the 3rd of April.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I don't {{know that}} I have," [...] {{admitted}} the elder. [...] "You've always shown a fair degree of moderation, after all. What {{do you think}} of taking up next? I mean after you have embraced your mother and sisters at Mount Desert. Real estate? It {{seems to me that it}} is about time for you to open out as a real-estate broker. Or <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> of matrimony?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> such {{thoughts}} as these? If you did not, not much matter, for {{you have all}} acted, more or less, in your better moments {{as if you had}} them. There are more things in a man's heart, thank God, than ever come into his head. Many a man does a noble thing by instinct, as we say, without ever THINKING whether it is a noble thing or not--without THINKING about it at all. Many a man, thank God, is led at times, by God's Spirit, without ever knowing whose Spirit it is that leads him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh father! <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> what it {{will come}} to?'

6000|$|... "Yes. I don't {{mean any}} cant, cut-and-dried morality. The world is getting beyond that. But have you, in your secret soul, any {{religion}} at all? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> about it? I'm not speaking about anything orthodox, but some religion--even a tiny speck of it, a germ--harmonizing with life, with that power we feel in us {{we seek to}} express and continually violate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So you won't?" [...] As {{the girl}} at first said nothing her {{companion}} caught at it. [...] "You won't, of course? I see you won't. But I don't see why, nevertheless, I shouldn't insist to you once for {{all on the}} plain truth of the whole matter. The truth, my dear, of your duty. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> about that? It's the greatest duty of all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just you try {{to think}} {{what it would have}} meant to be {{at the mercy of the}} meanest {{creature}} that ever commanded a ship! Just fancy what a life that crawling Johns would have led me! And I knew that in a week or so the white hair would begin to show. And the crew. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> of that? To be shown up as a low fraud before all hands. What a life for me till we got to Calcutta! And once there--kicked out, of course. Half-pay stopped. Annie here alone without a penny--starving; and I on the other side of the earth, ditto. You see? ...|$|E
60|$|Paul Ruttledge. Vagabonds--that is it. I {{want to be}} a vagabond, a wanderer. As I can't {{leap from}} cloud to cloud I want to wander from road to road. That little path there by the clipped edge goes up to the highroad. I want to go up that path and to walk along the highroad, and so on and on and on, and to know all kinds of people. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> that the roads are the only things that are endless; that one can walk on and on and on, and never be stopped by a gate or a wall? They are the serpent of eternity. I wonder they have never been worshipped. What are the stars beside them? They never meet one another. The roads are the only things that are infinite. They are all endless.|$|E
6000|$|On {{the sixth}} day of January {{in this year}} sixty-two, what {{hundreds}} of thousands--I may say, what millions of Englishmen, were {{in the position of}} the personage here sketched--Christian men, I hope, shocked at the dreadful necessity of battle: aware of the horrors which the conflict must produce, and yet feeling that the moment was come, {{and that there was no}} arbitrament left but that of steel and cannon! My reader, perhaps, has been in America. If he has, he knows what good people are to be found there; how polished, how generous, how gentle, how courteous. But it is not the voices of these you hear in the roar of hate, defiance, folly, falsehood, which comes to us across the Atlantic. You can't hear gentle voices; very many who could speak are afraid. Men must go forward, or be crushed by the maddened crowd behind them. I suppose after the perpetration of that act of--what shall we call it?--of sudden war, which Wilkes did, and Everett approved, most of us believed that battle was inevitable. Who has not read the American papers for six weeks past? <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> the United States Government would give up those Commissioners? I never did, for my part. It seems to me the United States Government have done the most courageous act of the war. Before that act was done, what an excitement prevailed in London! In every Club there was a parliament sitting in permanence: in every domestic gathering this subject was sure to form a main part of the talk. Of course I have seen many people who have travelled in America, and heard them on this matter--friends of the South, friends of the North, friends of peace, and American stockholders in plenty.--"They will never give up the men, sir," [...] that was the opinion on all sides; and, if they would not, we knew what was to happen.|$|E
40|$|A {{budget is}} a plan for {{spending}} and saving income over a specific period of time. Making and using a budget will help you keep track of and control your money. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> about how some people achieved a wealthy status? Many {{experts in the field}} of wealth-building suggest that most people who are considered wealthy became so by setting specific goals for their after-tax income, visual izing themselves as being financially successful, finding security and making financial sacrifices and compromises for later wealth...|$|R

6000|$|Now, as I write, {{my heart}} goes pit-a-pat, {{thinking}} of you, Rosarito; and I'm sure {{that if we had}} over again that charming time, I should fall head over ears in love. Oh, you know we were both fibbing when we vowed we adored one another; I am a romancer by profession, and you by nature.

60|$|Still we live meanly, like ants; {{though the}} fable {{tells us that}} we were long ago changed into men; like pygmies we fight with cranes; it is error upon error, and clout upon clout, and our best virtue has for its {{occasion}} a superfluous and evitable wretchedness. Our life is frittered away by detail. An honest man has hardly need to count more than his ten fingers, or in extreme cases he may add his ten toes, and lump the rest. Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity! I say, let your affairs be as two or three, and not a hundred or a thousand; instead of a million count half a dozen, and keep your accounts on your thumb-nail. In {{the midst of this}} chopping sea of civilized life, such are the clouds and storms and quicksands and thousand-and-one items to be allowed for, that a man has to live, if he would not founder and go to the bottom and not make his port at all, by dead reckoning, and he must be a great calculator indeed who succeeds. Simplify, simplify. Instead of three meals a day, if it be necessary eat but one; instead of a hundred dishes, five; and reduce other things in proportion. Our life is like a German Confederacy, made up of petty states, with its boundary forever fluctuating, so that even a German cannot tell you how it is bounded at any moment. The nation itself, with all its so-called internal improvements, which, by the way are all external and superficial, is just such an unwieldy and overgrown establishment, cluttered with furniture and tripped up by its own traps, ruined by luxury and heedless expense, by want of calculation and a worthy aim, as the million households in the land; and the only cure for it, as for them, is in a rigid economy, a stern and more than Spartan simplicity of life and elevation of purpose. It lives too fast. Men think that it is essential that the Nation have commerce, and export ice, and talk through a telegraph, and ride thirty miles an hour, without a doubt, whether they do or not; but whether we should live like baboons or like men, is a little uncertain. If we do not get out sleepers, and forge rails, and devote days and nights to the work, but go to tinkering upon our lives to improve them, who will build railroads? And if railroads are not built, how shall we get to heaven in season? But if we stay at home and mind our business, who will want railroads? We do not ride on the railroad; it rides upon us. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> what those sleepers are that underlie the railroad? Each one is a man, an Irishman, or a Yankee man. The rails are laid on them, and they are covered with sand, and the cars run smoothly over them. They are sound sleepers, I assure you. And every few years a new lot is laid down and run over; so that, if some have the pleasure of riding on a rail, others have the misfortune to be ridden upon. And when they run over a man that is walking in his sleep, a supernumerary sleeper in the wrong position, and wake him up, they suddenly stop the cars, and make a hue and cry about it, as if this were an exception. I am glad to know that it takes a gang of men for every five miles to keep the sleepers down and level in their beds as it is, for this is a sign that they may sometime get up again.|$|E

50|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} {{over the course}} of two years, and was executively produced and co-written by Simon Perry, alongside songwriter John McLaughlin, musician David Thomas, and co-production from the likes of Robbie Nevil and Dennis Johnson. The album was released on 3 July 2006, exclusively in Japan, following an argument with Costa's record label preventing a release in the United Kingdom. It failed to chart highly in Japan, and shortly after, Costa was dropped from the label. Only one single was released from the album, <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Think</b> of Me, which peaked at #19 on the UK Singles Chart.|$|R

Her face was turned up to him, and he pressed his lips upon her forehead. [...] "As my brother," [...] she said, stretching back her head and looking up into his face.|$|R
