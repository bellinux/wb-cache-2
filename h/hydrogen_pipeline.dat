25|$|<b>Hydrogen</b> <b>pipelines</b> {{are more}} {{expensive}} than even long-distance electric lines. Hydrogen is about three times bulkier in volume than natural gas for the same enthalpy. Hydrogen accelerates the cracking of steel (hydrogen embrittlement), which increases maintenance costs, leakage rates, and material costs.

40|$|We have {{assessed}} the transportation of hydrogen as a metal hydride slurry through pipelines over {{a short distance}} from a neighborhood hydrogen production facility to local points of use. The assessment was conducted {{in the context of a}} hydrogen "mini-grid" serving both vehicle fueling and stationary fuel cell power systems for local building heat and power. The concept was compared to a compressed gaseous hydrogen mini-grid option and to a stand-alone hydrogen fueling station. Based on our analysis results we have concluded that the metal hydride slurry concept has potential to provide significant reductions in overall energy use compared to liquid or chemical hydride delivery, but only modest reductions in overall energy use, hydrogen cost, and GHG emissions compared to a compressed gaseous hydrogen delivery. However, given the inherent (and perceived) safety and reasonable cost/efficiency of the metal hydride slurry systems, additional research and analysis is warranted.

40|$|Although {{nowadays}} {{hydrogen is}} distributed mainly by trailers, {{in the future}} distribution by means of pipelines will be more suitable if larger amounts of hydrogen are produced on industrial scale. Therefore from the safety point of view {{it is essential to}} compare <b>hydrogen</b> <b>pipelines</b> to natural gas pipelines, whose use is well established today. Within the paper we compare safety implications in accidental situations. In the analysis we do not consider technological aspects such as compressors or seals. Using a CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) tool, it is possible to investigate the effects of different properties (density, diffusivity, viscosity and flammability limits) of hydrogen and methane on the dispersion process. In addition CFD tools allow studying the influence of different release scenarios, geometrical configurations and atmospheric conditions. An accidental release from a pipeline is modelled. The release is simulated as a flow through a small hole between the high-pressure pipeline and the environment. A part of the pipeline is included in the simulations as high-pressure reservoir. Due to the large pressure difference between the pipeline and the environment, the flow conditions at the release become critical. For the assumed scenarios larger amount of flammable mixture could be observed in case of hydrogen release. On the other hand, because of buoyancy and a higher sonic speed at the release, the hydrogen clouds are farther from the ground level or buildings than in case of the methane clouds, decreasing the probability of ignition and reducing the flame acceleration due to obstacles in case of ignition. Results on the effect of wind in the release scenarios are also described. JRC. F. 4 -Nuclear design safet...|$|R

40|$|On August 8, 2005, the President {{signed the}} Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct) into law. In Subtitle F of EPAct, Congress set forth various {{provisions}} {{that would change}} the way certain federal agencies (Agencies) coordinate to authorize the use of land {{for a variety of}} energy-related purposes. As part of Subtitle F of EPAct, Section 368 addresses the issue of energy transportation corridors on federal land for oil, gas, and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>pipelines,</b> as well as electricity transmission and distribution facilities. Because of the critical importance of improving the nation's electrical transmission grid, Congress recognized that electricity transmission issues should receive added attention when the Agencies address corridor location and analysis issues. In Section 368, Congress specifically directed the Agencies to consider the need for upgraded and new facilities to deliver electricity: In carrying out [Section 368], the Secretaries shall take into account the need for upgraded and new electricity transmission and distribution facilities to (1) improve reliability; (2) relieve congestion; and (3) enhance capability of the national grid to deliver electricity. Section 368 does not require the Agencies to consider or approve specific projects, applications for rights-of-way (ROWs), or other permits within designated energy corridors. Importantly, Section 368 does not direct, license, or otherwise permit any on-the-ground activity of any sort. If an applicant is interested in obtaining an authorization to develop a project within any corridor designated under Section 368, the applicant would have to apply for a ROW authorization and applicable permits. The Agencies would consider each application by applying appropriate project-specific reviews under requirements of laws and related regulations, including, but not limited to, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). Under Section 368, Congress divided the United States into two groups of states: the 11 contiguous western states and the remaining states. Direction for energy transportation corridor analysis and selection in the 11 western states was addressed in Section 368 (a) of EPAct, while direction for energy transportation corridor analysis and selection in all other states was addressed under Section 368 (b) of EPAct. It was clearly the priority of Congress to conduct corridor location studies and designation first on federal lands in the western states. Under Section 368 (a), the Agencies produced a programmatic environmental impact statement (EIS), Designation of Energy Corridors on Federal Land in the 11 Western States (DOE and DOI 2008), that was used in part as the basis for designating more than 6, 000 mi (9, 656 km) of energy transportation corridors on federal land in 11 western states. Under Section 368 (a) of EPAct, Congress clearly stated the Agencies needed to (1) designate energy transportation corridors on federal land, (2) conduct the necessary environmental review of the designated corridors, and (3) incorporate the designated corridors into the appropriate land use plans. Congressional direction under Section 368 (b) of EPAct differs from that provided under Section 368 (a). Specifically, Section 368 (b) requires the secretaries of the Agencies, in consultation with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), affected utility industries, and other interested persons, to jointly: (1) Identify corridors for oil, gas, and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>pipelines</b> and electricity transmission and distribution facilities on federal land in states other than the 11 western states identified under Section 368 (a) of EPAct, and (2) Schedule prompt action to identify, designate, and incorporate the corridors into the applicable land use plans. While Section 368 (a) clearly directs designation as a necessary first step for energy transportation corridors in the 11 western states, Section 368 (b) directs the Agencies to first identify corridors and then schedule prompt action to identify, designate, and incorporate the corridors into applicable land use plans. To comply with the congressional direction provided in Section 368 (b), the Agencies investigated corridor identification issues in the Section 368 (b) states; this report to Congress provides information that could be relevant to possible future designation of energy corridors. Future designations, if appropriate and necessary, would occur when the Agencies undertake revisions and/or updates to land use plans that guide management decisions on lands located within individual administrative units, such as specific National Forests, National Parks, or Wildlife Refuges. At this time, the Agencies are not proposing any actions or decisions related directly or indirectly to designating energy corridors on federal land under Section 368 (b) of EPAct...|$|R

40|$|In {{this era}} of {{globalisation}} and modernisation, natural gas is {{becoming one of the}} most wanted natural resources in many industries basically for cooling and heating purpose. Due to the high demand, transporting natural gas via pipeline {{is the best way to}} fulfil the demand for natural gas. Hence, it is very important to transport natural gas via pipeline with safety precaution. Meanwhile, in future hydrogen gas has the capability to become one of the important energy resources for many industries. This will create an economy call hydrogen economy. It is expected hydrogen can become main source of energy to replace fossil fuels and can be transported via pipeline to meet customers demand. However, the physical properties of methane and hydrogen are totally different and also the safety to supply <b>hydrogen</b> via <b>pipeline</b> is taken into consideration. Therefore, this paper is aim to study about the dispersion effects of hydrogen and methane and do comparison among both gases. In this paper we will be using Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) software to detect leakage when transporting methane and hydrogen gas. The model that will be use is environmental area 240 m wide and 80 m high. Two 30 m wide and 20 m high buildings are placed to represent factory building. Underneath, a part of pipeline is modelled as a source where methane and hydrogen gases are released. The 2 m diameter pipeline is filled with either hydrogen gas or methane gas at pressure 11 bars. The leak in the pipe is located at x= 0 m. This study will be done by using different scenarios at different time interval which is at time 1 s and 7. 5 s and different wind speed; 0 m/s, 5 m/s, 10 m/s ad 15 m/s. The results show that, the rate of dispersion of hydrogen is higher compare to methane and methane tends to be more on the surface of the ground where ignition is possible. Using Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) is the best method to study about leakage of methane and hydrogen gas due to low cost involve rather than building up pipeline network to test the situation which is something irrational to be done. From this study, it can be clearly seen that the rate of dispersion of hydrogen will be higher compare to methane due to the gases properties like density and buoyancy force.
