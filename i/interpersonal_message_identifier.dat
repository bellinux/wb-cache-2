40|$|In {{previous}} work, it {{has been}} shown how to solve atomic broadcast by reduction to consensus on messages. While this solution is theoretically correct, it has its limitations in practice, since executing consensus on large messages can quickly saturate the system. The problem can be addressed by executing consensus on <b>message</b> <b>identifiers</b> instead of the full messages, in order to decouple the size of the messages from the size of the data sent by the consensus algorithm. In this paper, we study the impact of executing consensus on <b>message</b> <b>identifiers</b> instead of on the full messages, in the context of solving atomic broadcast. We also discuss the implications of executing consensus on <b>message</b> <b>identifiers</b> on the consensus and atomic broadcast algorithms...|$|R

With CAN, the network utilisation that may be obtained while ensuring that all messages meet their deadlines {{is strongly dependent on}} the policy used for priority (<b>message</b> <b>identifier)</b> assignment. This paper addresses the problem of priority assignment when some <b>message</b> <b>identifiers</b> are fixed. There are two variants of this problem: P 1 where the gaps between fixed identifiers are large enough to accommodate the freely assignable messages and P 2 when the gaps are too small. For problem P 1, we provide algorithms that give optimal and robust priority orderings based on an adaptation of existing techniques. Problem P 2 is more difficult to solve. We show via a counter example that the algorithms derived for P 1 and others recently published can fail to find a schedulable priority ordering when the gaps are small, even though one exists. We derive an optimal and robust solution to this problem with respect to a simple form of schedulability analysis which assumes the same upper bound on the length of all messages...|$|R

30|$|On a CAN bus every {{transmitting}} node {{monitors the}} state of the bus. Whenever a node tries to send a recessive bit, and reads back a dominant bit, it backs off and retries to send the interrupted message at a later point in time. As high-priority <b>message</b> <b>identifiers</b> contain more leading dominant bits than low-priority <b>identifiers,</b> a <b>message</b> with a high priority is sent first (i.e., it wins the arbitration). In order to reproduce this behavior, the CAN router maintains a priority queue at every destination CIS and transmits the messages to the destination CAN bus according to their priority.|$|R

Findings from this study will provide health education professionals with valuable information on body image from a cultural perspective. The Young Women’s Experiences with Body Weight and Shape Questionnaire (49 questions; containing five factors of weight dissatisfaction, slimness as quality of life, <b>interpersonal</b> <b>messages</b> regarding slimness, rejecting the value of thinness, and valuing exercise) were used and general demographics were collected. A One-Way ANOVA was used to test differences between the HBCU and PWC as well as for comparing differences between the three sub-groups (African American HBCU, African American PWC, and Euro American PWC). Significant differences were found with all five factors between HBCU and PWC: weight dissatisfaction (p<. 001), slimness as quality of life (p<. 001), <b>interpersonal</b> <b>messages</b> regarding slimness (p<. 001), rejecting the value of thinness (p=. 001) and valuing exercise (p=. 023).

30|$|We {{replace the}} CAN bus with a star {{topology}} {{based on an}} intelligent CAN router. Fault isolation {{is one of the}} primary objectives of the router and our main focus of this paper. The CAN router eliminates the hazard of medium failures of an individual CAN bus leading to a global communication failure. Furthermore, the router exploits a priori knowledge about the permitted behavior of CAN nodes in the time and value domains for the containment of node failures. In the time domain interarrival times are monitored and enforced. In the value domain, permitted <b>message</b> <b>identifiers</b> and constraints on the application data within a message are enforced.|$|R

30|$|Messages are {{represented}} as Erlang tuple data structures that consist of <b>message</b> <b>identifier,</b> a sender <b>identifier,</b> a <b>message</b> {{body and a}} timestamp. We implemented two message filtering rules that apply the principle of combining static with temporal filtering, as discussed in Section 3.

All received messages are stored in an ordered list that is reordered each time a new message is received, using {{a modified version of}} the Quicksort algorithm. The list is pruned periodically by applying the sliding time window principle, i.e., removing broadcast messages over 2 minutes old and team messages over 5 minutes old.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the schedulability analysis for control messages when networked control loops, built {{on top of}} the controller area network (CAN), are dynamically allocating bandwidth in terms of their controlled plants' dynamics. The bandwidth allocation policy is theoretically described by an optimization problem and practically solved by the distributed bitwise arbitration of CAN <b>messages</b> when <b>message</b> <b>identifiers,</b> i. e., priorities, reflect control applications demands. This poses the problem of assessing whether the set of real-time messages will meet their deadlines regardless of run-time priority changes. This is solved by a schedulability analysis based on recent results on worst-case response time techniques for real-time CAN applications. The analysis ends up with the schedulability test for this type of applications. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R

40|$|Hash-based message {{authentication}} codes are an extremely simple yet hugely effective construction for producing keyed message digests using shared secrets. HMACs have seen widespread use as ad-hoc digital signatures in many Internet applications. While messages signed with an HMAC are secure against sender impersonation and tampering in transit, if used alone they {{are susceptible to}} replay attacks. We propose a construction that extends HMACs to produce a keyed message digest that has a finite validity period. We then propose a message signature scheme that uses this time-dependent MAC along with an unique <b>message</b> <b>identifier</b> to calculate a set of authentication factors using which a recipient can readily detect and ignore replayed messages, thus providing perfect resistance against replay attacks. We further analyse time-based {{message authentication}} codes and show that they provide stronger security guarantees than plain HMACs, even when used independently of the aforementioned replay attack resistant message signature scheme...|$|R
