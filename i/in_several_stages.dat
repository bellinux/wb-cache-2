5|$|The lake existed <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>stages</b> {{over the}} last 2,000 years, {{periodically}} drying and refilling and eventually disappearing sometime after 1580. Between 1905-1907, due to an engineering accident, the Salton Sea formed {{in parts of the}} lower basin of Lake Cahuilla. Were it not for human intervention, the sea may have grown to the size of prehistoric Lake Cahuilla. Today the former lake bed forms the fertile regions of the Imperial and Coachella Valleys.|$|E
5|$|SR78 {{was one of}} the {{original}} state highways designated in 1934, although portions of the route existed as early as 1900. However, it was not designated east of Brawley until 1959. The freeway section in the North County of San Diego that connects Oceanside and Escondido was built {{in the middle of the}} twentieth century <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>stages,</b> including a transitory stage known as the Vista Way Freeway, and has been improved several times. An expressway bypass of the city of Brawley was completed in 2012. There are many projects slated to improve the freeway due to increasing congestion in the region.|$|E

5|$|The current I-195 was {{initially}} planned as a toll road called the Trenton-Asbury Park Expressway in the 1950s. In the 1960s, it became two proposed freeways Route 37 and Route 38 {{that were to}} cross {{the central part of}} the state. A compromise was reached for a single freeway between Trenton and Belmar which would get Interstate Highway funding as I-195. It was built <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>stages</b> during the 1970s and 1980s. There once existed a plan to extend the I-195 designation west to the upcoming interchange between the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-276) and I-95 in Bristol Township, Pennsylvania, but it was instead decided to extend the I-295 designation west and south, along existing I-95, to the new interchange.|$|E
5|$|The medieval city walls, built <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>stages</b> {{between the}} 13th and the 16th century, were torn down after the French {{annexation}} in the 17th century. However, four towers escaped destruction. The Tour des Sorcières ("witches' tower"), {{which served as}} a gate and a jail, is the tallest. The Tour de l'Horloge ("clock tower") was also originally part of a gate. The clock and the elaborate roof were added in 1614. Two much smaller towers can also be seen, one near the Ill river and another integrated into a later house. All these remains date from the 13th century.|$|E
5|$|The red-and-white spotted {{toadstool}} is {{a common}} image in many aspects of popular culture. Garden ornaments and children's picture books depicting gnomes and fairies, such as the Smurfs, often show fly agarics used as seats, or homes. Fly agarics have been featured in paintings since the Renaissance, albeit in a subtle manner. In the Victorian era they became more visible, becoming the main topic of some fairy paintings. Two {{of the most famous}} uses of the mushroom are in the video game series Super Mario Bros. (specifically two of the power-up items and the platforms <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>stages),</b> and the dancing mushroom sequence in the 1940 Disney film Fantasia.|$|E

5|$|The restorers {{washed the}} {{surfaces}} {{using a variety}} of solvents. Distilled water was used wherever possible to remove soot and dissolve water-soluble gums. Retouching and repainting that had been part of previous later restorations were removed with a gelatinous solvent, applied <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>stages</b> for measured times, and washed with distilled water. Salt efflorescences of calcium carbonate were treated by the application of a solution of dimethylformamide. The final step was the application of a weak solution of acrylic polymer to consolidate and protect the surface, and further washing.|$|E
5|$|Allen captained England in the {{remaining}} two Tests against India. The second game was drawn but England won the third and Allen took seven for 80, his best figures in Test matches. In the Tests, Allen scored 27 runs in three innings, and took 20 wickets at 16.50. His good form for Middlesex continued throughout the season and he performed well {{against some of the}} strongest opposition; he topped the county's batting averages and came second in bowling. The MCC team for Australia was chosen <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>stages</b> with input from Allen. Larwood was not considered; he had spoken out in the press against Australia and opponents of Bodyline, and like Voce, had not played a Test since the 1932–33 series. The selectors wished to include Voce but Allen at first threatened to resign were he to be included. He met Voce to discuss matters and the latter agreed to sign a statement in which he apologised for the past and in effect promised not to bowl Bodyline. He was therefore named in the touring team.|$|E
5|$|Pete Draper, {{who worked}} with Kamalakanna in Ghajini (2008), was {{selected}} as the pipeline technical director of the film. At that time, Kamalakannan was in Iran finalising the CG stadium and City with Adili. The majority of the film was shot in anamorphic format, but a Super 35 camera gate and lens were used for the stadium episode to minimise distortion. Post-production of the stadium scenes were given to Prasad EFX, and the film set up their own render farm in Chennai. The post process was done <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>stages</b> after the scan. The live stadium had only 7 steps, in which live people were positioned in 6 steps while the remaining 12 steps were CG extension. Adili created 3D CG people to fill the CG steps and their actions in a library of 3000 frames.|$|E

5|$|The castle motte {{was built}} up <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>stages,</b> {{originally}} being lower in height than today, before being built {{up during the}} medieval period and scarped by cutting away at the surrounding stone. It was then reinforced in 1700 {{with the addition of}} clay, before having large quantities of earth dumped on it in the late 18th century, and then being terraced in the mid-19th century. The motte is separated from the bailey by a ditch, now crossed by a modern bridge. In the 13th century this point was protected by a D-shaped tower, which still survives, located {{to one side of the}} gateway. The causeway steps up to the top of the mound were originally a roofed, stone corridor. There are the foundations of the castle well on the west side of the causeway.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the advance}} of the Red Army through Belgrade and north into the {{formerly}} Hungarian-occupied Yugoslav region of Baranja made holding {{the line of the}} Danube critical for the Germans. In early November the Soviet troops established a bridgehead over the Danube from Apatin (in modern-day Serbia). From 9 November onward, the division was committed <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>stages</b> to the Eastern Front, starting with the reconnaissance battalion which went into action at Dárda west of the Apatin bridgehead on 10 November. They were followed by a grouping of three battalions (I/27, II/28 and II/28), an artillery battalion (III/AR 13) and pioneer support. Known as Kampfgruppe Hanke after their commander Hans Hanke, they moved from the Brčko bridgehead and joined a blocking position at Pélmonostor on 14 November south-west of a second Soviet bridgehead that had been established at Batina (in modern-day Croatia). As a result, the last Muslim SS troops left Bosnia. Within a week they were joined by the reconnaissance battalion, which had acquitted itself well in fighting west of Apatin. By 20 November, the Red Army was across the Danube in force at Batina. The following day Kampfgruppe Hanke was driven out of its positions, when the remaining 200 troops withdrew. By 25 November the rest of the division was on its way from the Zagreb area. The remnants of Kampfgruppe Hanke were placed under command of Reichsgrenadier Division Hoch und Deutschmeister, withdrawing as far as Siklós in southern Hungary by 29 November.|$|E
