30|$|Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is an {{important}} cultured carnivorous species that, in the past, has not tolerated high levels of most plant protein feed ingredients in their diet Gatlin et al. (2007). The inclusion of plant protein sources in aquafeeds is expanding due to the limited amount of fishmeal available {{for the production of}} animal feeds Glencross et al. (2005; Gatlin et al. 2007). Juvenile Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) fed diets that contain 5 % fishmeal or less have been shown to have comparable growth to fish fed a 37 % fishmeal diet when amino acids were supplemented Silva et al. (2009). For inclusion in the diets of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), many different plant protein sources have been examined, including plant protein meals and plant protein concentrates Lim and Webster (Lim et al. 2008). Canola protein concentrate (CPC), soybean meal and soy protein concentrates, pea protein concentrate, barley protein concentrate, rice protein concentrate, and wheat gluten meal have all been tested as fishmeal replacements with varying degrees of success Forster et al. (1999; Thiessen et al. 2003; Barrows et al. 2007; Lim et al. 2008; Gaylord and Barrows 2009). Many of these same protein sources have been tested in Atlantic salmon (Lim et al. 2008). Atlantic salmon was shown to have slightly reduced, but not significantly lower, performance when fed diets that were fishmeal-free and contained wheat gluten, corn gluten, <b>fish</b> <b>soluble,</b> and crystalline amino acids (Espe et al. 2006). Atlantic salmon fed a diet that contained 12 % fishmeal had slightly decreased growth but produced 2 kg of fish for every 1 kg of fishmeal consumed (Torstensen et al. 2008). Stickwater, the water-soluble fraction that is produced in making fishmeal, has been shown to stimulate the growth of Atlantic salmon when fed low fishmeal diets (10 % of the diet) and high plant protein diets (62 % of the diet) (Kousoulaki et al. 2009). Amino acid supplementation is often needed to maintain the growth performance of fish fed plant protein-based feeds (Espe et al. 2007; Lim et al. 2008; Gaylord and Barrows 2009). A major challenge is {{to increase the amount of}} plant or other non-animal protein in the diet of carnivorous fishes while maintaining acceptable growth, feed conversion, and production costs compared to traditional diets.|$|E
40|$|A produção {{comercial}} de peixes carnívoros exige o uso de um conjunto complexo de práticas de manejo da produção e alimentação, à redução do impacto ambiental dos alimentos e à minimização do emprego de fontes protéicas de origem animal nas formulações das dietas. O objetivo do presente estudo foi investigar o uso de atrativos alimentares em dietas formuladas exclusivamente à base de proteína de origem vegetal (PV), e seus efeitos no desempenho, composição corporal e digestibilidade das dietas pelo carnívoro black bass, Micropterus salmoides, condicionados a aceitar ração seca. Novecentos juvenis (26, 54 ± 1, 53 g) foram estocados em 60 aquários de polietileno de 90 L (15 peixes/aquário), em delineamento experimental totalmente ao acaso (n= 3), e alimentados {{ad libitum}} em duas refeições diárias (07 h 00 m e 17 h 00 m), durante 13 dias, com uma dieta basal (100 % PV) contendo seis níveis de proteína solúvel de peixe  PSP (0, 5, 1, 0, 1, 5, 2, 0, 2, 5 e 3, 0 %); Fisharom ®  FA (0, 02, 0, 04, 0, 06, 0, 08, 0, 10 e 0, 12 %); silagem de peixe  SP (1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4, 0, 5, 0 e 6, 0 %); um controle positivo (10 % de farinha de peixe) e um controle negativo (dieta basal sem atrativos). Os peixes alimentados com a dieta contendo FA 0, 02 % apresentaram melhor taxa de crescimento, ganho de peso e conversão alimentar, mas não apresentaram diferenças dos demais tratamentos (P> 0, 05). Os peixes alimentados com dietas contendo SP como atrativo apresentaram os piores resultados de desempenho. Em uma segunda etapa, foi avaliado o desempenho e a composição corporal de 560 juvenis (3, 06 ± 0, 20 g) estocados em gaiolas de 60 L, dentro de caixas de polietileno de 1. 000 L, instaladas em laboratório com um sistema fechado de recirculação de água com temperatura (27 o C ± 1, 07 o C) e fotoperíodo (14 L: 10 E) controlados, em um delineamento experimental totalmente ao acaso (n= 4), e alimentados ad libitum em duas refeições diárias (07 h 00 m e 17 h 00 m), durante 43 dias, com 7 dietas isonitrogenadas (40 % de PB) e isocalóricas (3. 500 kcal/kg), contendo níveis decrescentes de proteína de origem vegetal: 100 PV: 00 PA; 100 PV + 0, 02 % Fisharon ®; 80 PV: 20 PA; 60 PV: 40 PA; 40 PV: 60 PA; 50 PV: 50 PA (sem farinha de peixe); e uma dieta controle (ração comercial). A inclusão de farinha de peixe e farinha de penas foi limitada em 7 %; a inclusão de farinha de vísceras e farinha de carne em 15 %. DL-metionina (98 %) e L-lisina (80 %) foram adicionadas automaticamente através de matriz de aplicativo de formulação de ração. Em uma terceira etapa, foi avaliada a digestibilidade das rações utilizadas no experimento anterior. Para tanto, 1. 960 juvenis (14, 0 ± 1, 0 cm) foram confinados em gaiolas de polipropileno e alimentados durante 40 dias, no período diurno, com as sete dietas do experimento anterior acrescidas de 0, 5 % de óxido de cromio. No período noturno as gaiolas eram transferidas para aquários cilíndrico-cônicos de 200 L, onde as fezes eram coletadas por sedimentação em recipiente refrigerado. O farelo de soja pode ser utilizado como substituto parcial de fontes protéicas e origem animal em rações formuladas para o black bass; a farinha de vísceras pode ser considerada uma boa opção como fonte protéica de origem animal em rações. Os melhores resultados de desempenho foram relacionados aos tratamentos controle e 50 PV: 50 PA. A necessidade do uso da farinha de peixe na formulação de dietas para espécies carnívoras é no mínimo questionável e a determinação da digestibilidade das rações, visando maior precisão em formulações de custo mínimo para peixes carnívoros, deve ser prática corrente na indústria da alimentação de peixes. Commercial farming of carnivorous fish demands {{the use of}} a complex group of practices of production and feeding management, the reduction of the environmental impact of the feeds and the minimization of {{the use of a}}nimal protein sources in the diets. The present study investigated the use of feed stimulants in diets formulated exclusively out of plant protein, and their effects in growth performance, body composition and digestibility of the feeds for the carnivore largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, conditioned to accept dry feed. Nine hundred juvenile largemouth bass (26. 54 ± 1. 53 g) were stocked in 60, 90 -L polyethylene aquaria (15 fish/aquarium), in a totally randomized experimental design (n= 3). Fish were fed ad libitum two daily meals (0700 and 1700), for 13 days, with a basal diet (100 % plant protein) containing increasing levels of <b>fish</b> <b>soluble</b> protein  FSP (0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0, 2. 5, and 3. 0 %); Fisharom TM  FA (0. 02, 0. 04, 0. 06, 0. 08, 0. 10 and 0. 12 %); fish silage  FS (1. 0, 2. 0, 3. 0, 4. 0, 5. 0 and 6. 0 %); a positive control (10 % of fish meal) and a negative control (basal diet without stimulants). Fish fed the diet containing 0. 02 %FA presented better growth rate, weight gain and feed conversion rate, but did not differ from the other treatments (P> 0, 05). Fish fed diets containing FS as stimulant presented the poorest performance. Next, the effect of different levels of dietary plant protein in the performance and body composition of the species was evaluated. Five hundred and sixty juvenile largemouth bass (3. 06 ± 0. 20 g) were stocked in 60 -L cages, inside 1, 000 -L polyethylene tanks, installed at a laboratory with closed water-recirculating system and controled temperature (27 o C ± 1. 07 o C) and photoperiod (14 L: 10 D). Fish were fed ad libitum two daily meals (0700 and 1700), for 43 days, with 7 isonitrogenous (40 % of PB) and isoenergetic (3, 500 kcal/kg) diets, containing decreasing levels of plant protein: 100 PP: 00 AP; 100 PP + 0. 02 % Fisharom®; 80 PP: 20 AP; 60 PP: 40 AP; 40 PP: 60 AP; 50 PP: 50 AP (without fish meal); and a control diet (commercial feed). Inclusion of fish meal and feathers meal was limited to 7 %; the inclusion of poultry by-product meal and meat and bone meal to 15 %. DL methionine (98 %) and L-lysine (80 %) were added automatically through feed formulation software matrix. Trial was set up in a totally randomized experimental design (n= 4). Finally, digestibility of the diets used in the experiment 2 was studied. One thousand, nine hundred and eighty juvenile largemouth bass (14. 0 ± 1. 0 cm) conditioned to accept artificial, dry feed were confined in polypropilene cages and fed, for 40 days, in day time, with the seven experimental diets added of 0. 5 % of cromic oxide. In the night, cages were transferred to cylindrical-conical bottomed, 200 -L aquaria, where feces were collected by sedimentation into refrigerated containers. Data were submitted to the ANOVA and Tukeys test of comparison of means through statistical software package SAS (P= 0. 05). Soybean meal can be used as partial substitute of animal protein in diets for largemouth bass; the poultry by-product meal shows as a good option as animal protein source in these rations. Best performances were related to the control treatments and 50 PP: 50 AP; the need for the use of fishmeal in the formulation of diets for carnivorous species is, at least, questionable. Results of the digestibility trials demonstrated the importance of determining the digestibility of the rations, if precision in the formulation of least-cost feeds for carnivorous fish is the ultimate goal...|$|E

The nutritional quality of sardine solubles has been evaluated by feeding trials using albino rats also.

But, during later stages (7 - 10 weeks), solubles incorporated diet supported a distinctly higher growth rate. This effect was more pronounced in female rats (17 % over the control group) compared to the male rats (4 % over the control group). <b>Fish</b> <b>solubles</b> are found to be poor sources of essential amino acids.

Experiment 1 {{investigated}} the effects of Lactobacillus plantarum (LP) or fermented soybean meal (FSBM) on nursery pig growth performance. A LP × FSBM interaction was detected for G:F, where LP and FSBM individually improved G:F, but the effect was not additive. Experiment 2 evaluated the effects of increasing levels of LP on nursery pig performance. No evidence for differences in growth performance were observed among dietary treatments. Experiment 3 and 4 {{examined the effects of}} fish meal source and level on nursery pig growth performance. Overall, a source × level interaction for ADG, G:F and final BW was observed as increasing fish meal source 1 improved ADG and G:F; however, pigs fed fish meal source 2 had improved ADG and G:F at 3 %, but decreased at 6 %. Pigs fed fish meal source 3 had no further improvements in ADG and G:F beyond the 3 % inclusion. No evidence for differences were detected between the dietary treatments for ADFI. Experiment 5 evaluated the effects of feeding <b>fish</b> <b>solubles</b> on nursery pig performance. Pigs fed diets with fish meal had increased ADG and ADFI compared to pigs fed the control diet.

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{series of}} six {{experiments}} were conducted over a six-year period {{to determine the}} effect of rearing conditions, breeder housing conditions and diet composition, on hatchability of eggs and poults growth due to transfer of unknown dietary factors from the breeder hen diet.

The response obtained from complete diet was shown to be due to fish meal and a dried <b>fish</b> <b>solubles</b> supplement. In most of the experiments the fish factor response was observed {{toward the end of the}} reproductive period indicating a depletion of the factor from the hen during egg production.

40|$|Stickwater, a {{by-product}} of the fish meal and oil industry, is an aqueous suspension of fish proteins, lipids, and other materials, and also contains soluble nonprotein nitrogen but not carbohydrate. It is usually partially evaporated by heat to a marketable form called "fish solubles," which is sold with an acid preservative as an animal feed supplement. However, <b>fish</b> <b>solubles</b> are only used to a limited extent in feeds, because the lipids of solubles (averages 11 %) are relatively prone to oxidative rancidity development. An investigation was undertaken to digest and/or stabilize lipids in stickwater by lipolytic fermentations and, at the same time, to attempt to increase the protein content as single cell protein. Strains of the yeast Candida lipolytica and the yeast like mold Geotrichum candidum were employed for these investigations. Stickwater fermentations were performed in a laboratory bench top fermentor. Respirometric studies of lipid metabolic activity and microbial observations were periodically performed during these fermentations. Rapid microbial growth and metabolic activity were observed in well aerated cultures. Fermented products were evaluated for chemical composition. Lipid residues were characterized by thin-layer chromatographic procedures. There was evidence of abundant microbial growth, increased lipolytic activity, and decreased lipid content. However, evidence was lacking {{to show that the}} protein content of stickwater was actually increased...|$|R

The published article is copyrighted by the American Society for Horticultural Science and can be found at: [URL] impact of organic fertilizer source on the growth, fruit quality, and yield of blackberry (Rubus L. subgenus Rubus Watson) cultivars (Marion and Black Diamond) grown in a machine-harvested, organic production system for the processed market was evaluated from 2011 to 2013. The planting was established in Spring 2010 using approved practices for organic production and was certified in 2012. Plants were irrigated using a dripline under a woven polyethylene groundcover (weed mat) installed for weed management. Two sources of liquid fertilizer were evaluated: 1) a corn steep liquor and fish waste digestion blend (‘‘corn’’; 2. 5 N– 1. 1 P– 1. 2 K); and 2) a <b>fish</b> <b>solubles</b> and molasses blend (‘‘fish’’; 4 N– 0 P– 1. 7 K). Fertilizers were applied by fertigation through the drip system at rates of 56 kg·ha⁻¹ nitrogen (N) per year in 2011 – 12 and 90 kg·ha⁻¹ N in 2013. The impact of fertigation on drip system performance was evaluated with two maintenance options, ‘‘flushing’’ and ‘‘no flushing’’ of the driplines. Total yield differed among years, whereas fruit soluble solids concentration and firmness as well as floricane biomass at pruning showed a year 3 cultivar interaction. ‘Black Diamond’ had greater total yield and average fruit weight than ‘Marion’, but produced a greater proportion unmarketable fruit. There was no effect of fertilizer source on yield, fruit quality, primocane length, or primocanes/plant in any year with the exception of fruit weight,which was greater with corn than with fish. ‘Marion’ had a greater floricane biomass when fertilized with fish than with corn. Soil nutrients were within the recommended range, except for boron (B), which was below recommended levels. Only soil nitrate-N was affected by fertilizer source, which was greater in ‘Marion’ than in ‘Black Diamond’ when fertilized with fish. Primocane leaf tissue nutrient concentrations were within recommended levels for all nutrients, except for calcium (Ca) and B, which were below recommended standards in both cultivars. Primocane leaf potassium (K) and zinc (Zn) concentrations were greater with fish than with corn. There was no fertilizer source or maintenance effect on emitter flow rate of the drip system in either year. However, flow rates decreased an average of 4. 5...|$|R
40|$|The {{rheological}} behavior, gel {{properties and}} nanostructure of complex modified fish scales gelatin (FSG) by pectin and microbial transglutaminase (MTGase) were investigated. The findings suggested that MTGase and pectin have {{positive effect on}} the gelation point, melting point, apparent viscosity and gel properties of FSG. The highest values of gel strength and melting temperature could be observed at 0. 8 % (w/v) pectin. Nevertheless, at highest pectin concentration (1. 6 % w/v), the gel strength and melting temperature of complex modified gelatin gels decreased. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis revealed that MTGase catalyzed cross-links among <b>soluble</b> <b>fish</b> scales gelatin – pectin complexes, which could be responsible for the observed increase in rheological behavior, gel strength and melting temperature of modified complex gels...|$|R
40|$|The {{threat of}} a {{hydrocarbon}} contamination in the sea-ice covered areas is growing rapidly dueto increasing human activities in the polar regions, which require petroleum as energy source,and due to a fast growing interest in exploiting the estimated one fourth of the world?s oilreservoirs of the Arctic Ocean. This dissertation assessed the influence of crude oil contamination on sea-ice microbialcommunities (SIMCO) in the Arctic and the Southern Ocean. Field and laboratory experiments were conducted with indigenous sea-ice bacterial communities, while testing three fertilizers, Inipol, <b>fish</b> meal, and <b>soluble</b> inorganic nutrients, for the stimulation of hydrocarbon biodegradation. To test whether bioaugmentation can further enhance oil biodegradation processes, oil degrading bacteria were enriched and reinoculated in oil contaminated sea-ice. The response of the bacterial sea-ice communities was assessed by the molecular methods DGGE andFISH. Hydrocarbon degradation efficiency was determined with oil fingerprints obtained by GC-FID and radio tracer experiments of single hydrocarbon substances...|$|R
40|$|Mercury (Hg) is {{a global}} {{pollutant}} that {{is known to have}} adverse effects on human health, and most human exposure to toxic methylmercury is through <b>fish</b> consumption. <b>Soluble</b> Hg compounds in the marine environment can be methylated in the water column and enter the base of the food chain. Atmospheric deposition is the most important pathway by which Hg enters marine ecosystems. The atmospheric chemistry of Hg has been simulated over Europe and the Mediterranean for the year 2009, using the WRF/Chem model and employing two different gas phase Hg oxidation mechanisms. The contributions to the marine deposition flux from dry deposition, synoptic scale wet deposition and convective wet deposition have been determined. The Hg deposition fluxes resulting from transcontinental transport and local/regional emission sources has been determined using both Br/BrO and O 3 /OH atmospheric oxidation mechanisms. The two mechanisms give significantly different annual deposition fluxes (129 Mg and 266 Mg respectively) over the modelling domain. Dry deposition is more significant using the O 3 /OH mechanism, while proportionally convective wet deposition is enhanced using the Br/BrO mechanism. The simulations using the Br/BrO oxidation compared best with observed Hg fluxes in precipitation. Local/regional Hg emissions have the most impact within the model domain during the summer. A comparison of simulations using the 2005 and 2010 AMAP/UNEP Hg emission inventories show that although there is a decrease of 33 % in anthropogenic emissions between the two reference years, the total simulated deposition in the regions diminishes by only 12 %. Simulations using the 2010 inventory reproduce observations somewhat better than those using the 2005 inventory for 2009...|$|R
40|$|Malachite Green (MG), a toxic {{chemical}} {{used as a}} dye, topical antiseptic and antifungal agent for <b>fish,</b> is highly <b>soluble</b> in water, cytotoxic to various mam-malian cells and also acts as a liver tumor promoter. In view of its industrial importance and possible ex-posure to human beings, MG possesses a potential environmental health hazard. So, we performed with HepG 2, a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to toxicity of MG. And we compared gene expression between control and MG treatment to identify genes that are specifically or predominantly expressed by employing annealing control primer (ACP) -based GeneFishingTM method. The cytotoxi-city (IC 20) of MG was determined above the 0. 867 µM in HepG 2 cell for 48 h treatment. And the DEGs of MG were identified that 5 out of 6 DEGs were up-regulated and 1 out of 6 DEGs was down-regulated by MG. Also, MG induced late apoptosis and necro-sis in a dose dependent in flow cytometric analysis. Through further investigation, we will identify more meaningful and useful DEGs on MG, and then can get the information on mechanism and pathway as-sociated with toxicity of MG...|$|R
