5|$|Despite the {{settlement}} recognising {{his claim to}} Morley's music patent, Barley seemingly {{found it difficult to}} enforce his rights, even with <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>role</b> as a stationer. Less than half of the known music books published from 1606 to 1613 recognised Barley's rights on the imprint. Barley took Thomas Adams to the Stationers' court in 1609, challenging the copyrights of the music books Adams had published. The court handed down a settlement similar to the one between East and Barley. However, none of the music books Adams published afterward contained any recognition of Barley's patent.|$|E

5|$|Such was his {{influence}} that Mertens was named new club captain for the 2008–09 Eerste Divisie season. Mertens excelled in <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>role</b> and contributed a further 13 {{goals for the}} season which contributed to him being awarded the Golden Bull award for the most talented player in the Eerste Divisie. It {{would be his last}} season with the club, however, as {{at the end of the}} season he agreed to join Eredivisie side Utrecht. Mertens made 110 appearances across all competitions for AGOVV during his three seasons at the club and netted 31 goals.|$|E

Houstoun's achievement in navigating the storm was recognised through a transfer to Buffalo, a larger and more prestigious vessel than Integrity. His former colonial command was allocated to midshipman Charles Robbins, who was promoted Acting Lieutenant by virtue of <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>role.</b> The remaining vessels in the flotilla, Lady Nelson and Francis, arrived in Port Dalrymple on 21 November. Integrity departed a week later, Robbins having been ordered to explore the far western coastline of Van Diemen's Land.|$|E

50|$|Buckley {{resigned}} in protest but crucially, Dolan kept respected coach Noel O'Reilly on his staff. After a disappointing finish {{to his first}} season, Dolan spent relatively large sums on securing the top young Irish players available and signed three of the Ireland team that {{finished third in the}} 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship. His large squad won the 1997/98 League championship {{on the last day of}} the season as arch rivals Shelbourne lost a 2-point lead. After leading St Pats to a credible performance in the Champions League against Celtic in September 1998 Dolan resigned as manager to concentrate on <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>roles</b> as managing director and Director of Football. He had also purchased a major shareholding in the club.|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of the finger spinners' success, Australian captain Ian Johnson tried to convert Davidson into a left arm {{orthodox}} spinner. Davidson returned as Australia faced a fourth meeting with Laker and Lock, in a match against Surrey immediately after the two consecutive Test maulings. On a sticky wicket that played {{into the hands of the}} Surrey spinners, Australia were skittled for 143. Only Davidson, who took the attack to the pair, made 44 not out. One six that he lofted from Laker almost reached the iconic gasometer outside The Oval. The match was drawn, and Davidson took 2/50 including Eric Bedser and Laker in <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>role</b> as a slow bowler.|$|E
5|$|Bradman had {{words with}} Barnes after this match about <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>role</b> as an opener. Barnes later wrote: He {{asked me how}} I liked it. I said it suited me. 'You batted very well in this game,' he said, 'but not quite as an opener. You were looking for runs all the time. I think {{what you want to}} watch as an opener is not getting out...

5|$|Ferb was {{originally}} {{going to be}} voiced by actor Mitchel Musso. However, when Phineas and Ferb was picked up as a full series, Povenmire and Marsh chose to make Ferb British and cast Thomas Sangster as his voice. However, they enjoyed Musso to a level that they recast him {{as the voice of}} the character Jeremy Johnson; although Musso no longer voices a title character, <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>role</b> allows him more lines. Sangster himself is a British actor and was among several cast members hired that hailed from England. Marsh himself had lived in the country for seven years and developed a fondness for the culture and people.|$|E

5000|$|According to the musicologist Elizabeth Forbes, Burchuladze's [...] "magnificent dark-toned {{voice and}} {{imposing}} stature {{are ideal for}} both the Russian repertory and Giuseppe Verdi's bass roles". He has also been described by classical music critics as acting [...] "sly, gravelly", being [...] "imposing", and [...] "wonderfully menacing". Burchuladze announced he was leaving music to focus on <b>his</b> <b>new</b> political <b>role</b> in May 2016.|$|R
50|$|Huon in Weber's Oberon {{provided}} a <b>new</b> <b>role</b> in Zurich in 1998, when he also sang Parsifal in Berlin. In 1999, he appeared as Lohengrin in St Petersburg {{as a guest}} with the Kirov Opera, sang Walther in Chicago and returned to Stockholm for Don Jose in Carmen. <b>His</b> last <b>new</b> <b>role</b> was Florestan in Fidelio, which he sang at the Vienna State Opera {{the night before he}} died.

5|$|In <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>role</b> Nichols {{clashed with}} the AEC {{over the issue of}} whether it or the Department of Defense should have custody of nuclear weapons. The administration's policy {{remained}} firmly in favor of AEC control. This was tested during the Berlin Blockade, when Truman ordered B-29 bombers to Europe. For a time there was talk of calling off the Operation Sandstone nuclear weapons tests, but Nichols successfully argued for their continuation. In 1950, he became Deputy Director of the Guided Missiles Division of the Department of Defense, overseeing the Nike Project. He was appointed Chief of Research and Development when it was reorganized in 1952. Nichols retired from the Army on 31 October 1953. For his services from 1948 to 1953, he was belatedly awarded a second Distinguished Service Medal in 1956.|$|E

For the quiet Matt, who seldom plays football, <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>role</b> of QB1 calls for a different part of him. Motherless, he also cares for his grandmother while his father is fighting in Iraq. Matt falls in love with Coach Taylor's daughter, Julie, who loathes Texas small town life and dislikes football. She falls for Matt and their relationship slowly blossoms over the season.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Holtby {{was converted}} {{to the left}} wing position by new club manager Jürgen Seeberger. Excelling in <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>role,</b> he scored his first goal for the club on 8 December 2008 against 1860 Munich before netting a brace in a 6–2 drubbing of Nürnberg in February the following year. He ultimately made 31 appearances for the season and scored eight goals as Aachen ended the campaign in fourth place, narrowly missing out on {{a spot in the}} promotion playoffs. Holtby's form for the season saw him awarded the Gold Fritz Walter Medal for the best German U19 player in 2009, ahead of runners-up Konstantin Rausch and André Schürrle.|$|E

Capaldi wrote back to Thomas thanking him, and sent a note to the child's father saying that he intended to send a video message. Capaldi enclosed guidance to Ross Goodall on how to organise a tour of the production studios for Doctor Who.|$|E
5|$|In May 1940, Nazi Germany invaded Belgium as World War II {{broke out}} across Europe. Although Hergé briefly fled to France and {{considered}} a self-imposed exile, he ultimately {{decided to return}} to his occupied homeland. For political reasons, the Nazi authorities closed down Le Vingtième Siècle, leaving Hergé unemployed. In search of employment, he got a job as an illustrator at Belgium's leading newspaper, Le Soir (The Evening), which was allowed to continue publication under German management. On 17 October 1940, he was made editor of the children's supplement, Le Soir Jeunesse, in which he set about producing new Tintin adventures. In this new, more repressive political climate of German-occupied Belgium, Hergé could no longer explore political themes in his Adventures of Tintin lest he be arrested by the Gestapo. As Harry Thompson noted, Tintin's role as a reporter came to an end, to be replaced by <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>role</b> as an explorer.|$|E
5|$|Richardson {{met with}} some initial success in <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>role,</b> {{learning}} Samoan and implementing {{a number of}} reforms. He focussed on transforming the country's economy into one based upon agriculture with a long term view of Samoan self-governance, and also implemented welfare and educational programs. His results were such that his term of three years in Western Samoa was extended by a further two years. He was also knighted, being made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the June 1925 Birthday Honours. However, {{over the next two}} years he had to deal with the increasing influence of the Mau movement, a nationalist group agitating for independence via peaceful means. While his administrative experience was helpful for carrying the reforms he had initiated, he lacked the political and diplomatic skills to deal with the Mau. He took a heavy handed approach to asserting his authority and deported several leaders of the Mau. This did not have the desired effect and dissent amongst the general population towards the New Zealand administration only increased. Richardson was forced to call in marines from the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy to deal with the civil unrest. Shortly afterwards, on 31 March 1928, he retired. Later in the year he was the New Zealand representative to the League of Nations meeting which discussed the administration of Western Samoa.|$|E
50|$|In 1935 Merrill {{left the}} Botanic Garden {{and took a}} job as Administrator of Botanical Collections at Harvard University, a new {{position}} created to consolidate the supervision of eight separate Harvard botanical units. A year after his arrival Merrill also became the Arnold Professor of Botany, and in 1937 the Director of the Arnold Arboretum. In <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>roles</b> Merrill devoted significant time to expanding the herbarium of the Arnold Arboretum and to research on Asiatic plants. Over the next ten years 220,000 plant specimens were acquired from all parts of Asia and the Asia-Pacific. Meanwhile, Merrill continued to publish numerous papers on Asia flora as well as articles dealing with the cultivation and dispersion of domesticated plants. During the Second World War he consulted with the United States War Department and wrote a handbook, Emergency Food Plants and Poisonous Plants of the Islands of the Pacific.|$|R

In 2008 he appeared in a revival of Simon Gray's The Common Pursuit at the Menier Chocolate Factory.|$|R
50|$|Du Chun {{lives in}} low profile life. He {{believes}} “reward is proportional to efforts”. He lives in Beijing, but rarely home due to his busy acting schedule. He is well liked by his colleagues and never had any rumors or scandals in the news. He likes photography. He communicates with his fans through blogs in which he often gives updates about <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>roles</b> and photos, as well as shares his feelings about the world, especially related to natural disasters and environmental issues. He called for prayers and donations many times when disaster happened. He is a good son {{to his mother and}} father even though they divorced many years ago, which won him the title of “Top Ten Model Sons of Filial Piety (孝子)” in 2010. He was also named the “2009 Youth Inspirational Figure in China” and established himself as a role model for the young people for his positive attitude and diligent work.|$|R
5|$|Due to Tom's illness, Falcon-Price {{takes over}} the {{operation}} of the station and the team must deal with his constant presence and the pressure which they are put under. Falcon-Price's constant attempts to prove that Tom is not up to his job have also grown more intense at Tom's initial sign of weakness. We see that Alex is having trouble dealing with <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>role</b> as a father, and, on top of this, Alex is stabbed by a criminal, and this begins to look as if it is all Tom's fault. The two rivals, Kelly and Joss, enter into new romances: Joss with a pickpocket victim and Kelly with a rival lawyer. They must deal with their constant jealousy of each other and their constant drive to outdo each other, as it had been ever since they left the Academy. Joss must also deal with his growing gambling debts and the consequences of these, including his being beaten up, his being forced to get a second job and his becoming homeless. He must also deal with the people around him who, in trying to help him, make him feel worse; particularly the arrival of his mother in town. Dismissed police officer Adam Cooper also arrives back in Mount Thomas, {{for the first time since}} Tom dismissed him in 1998. This time he arrives in Mount Thomas as a photocopier technician and wants to take revenge on Tom. In an attempt to do this, he tries to frame him for a crime he did not commit. In the heat of these allegations against Mount Thomas' top cop, there is the very real possibility that the Mount Thomas police station may be closed forever, and the team are forced to find new placements and the possibility of separation from one another.|$|E
5|$|Pirlo {{began his}} club {{career as an}} attacking midfielder with his home-town side Brescia, where he later helped the team to win the Serie B title and obtain Serie A {{promotion}} in 1997. His promising performances led to a move to Internazionale in 1998, but he struggled to gain playing time at his new club due to his lack of pace as well as heavy competition with other players in his position and was subsequently sent on loan in 1999. Despite successful spells with Reggina and Brescia once again, Pirlo was still unable to break into Inter's starting line-up and was sold to cross-city rivals Milan in 2001. At Milan, manager Carlo Ancelotti decided to shift Pirlo {{in front of the}} defence as a deep-lying playmaker, which allowed him more time on the ball to orchestrate his team's attacks. Pirlo excelled in <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>role</b> and soon developed into a world-class midfielder, playing a key role in Milan's subsequent successes, as he won two UEFA Champions Leagues (2003 and 2007), two UEFA Super Cups (2003 and 2007), two Serie A titles (2004 and 2011), a FIFA Club World Cup (2007), a Supercoppa Italiana (2004) and a Coppa Italia (2003) with the club. After joining Juventus on a free transfer in 2011, who had gone trophyless since 2003, he added four more Serie A titles (2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015), which he won consecutively, as well as two Supercoppa Italiana titles (2012 and 2013) and a Coppa Italia (2015). After playing in Italy for over 20 seasons, Pirlo joined MLS expansion side New York City FC in 2015, helping the team to reach the playoffs in his second and third seasons. In November 2017, Pirlo retired {{at the end of the}} MLS season.|$|E
5|$|Soejima's {{first major}} {{work for the}} series was working on side {{characters}} for Persona 2 alongside Kaneko. Kaneko put Soejima {{in charge of the}} series' art direction after Persona 2 as Kaneko did not want to imprint his drawing style on the Persona series, and also wanted Soejima to gain experience. Soejima felt a degree of pressure when he was given <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>role,</b> as the series had accumulated a substantial following during Kaneko's tenure. In a later interview, Soejima said that although he respected and admired Kaneko, he never consciously imitated the latter's work, and eventually settled into the role of pleasing the fans of the Persona series, approaching character designs with the idea of creating something new rather than referring back to Kaneko's work. For his character designs, Soejima uses real people he has met or seen, looking at what their appearance says about their personality. If his designs come too close to the people he has seen, he does a rough sketch while keeping the personality of the person in mind. For his work on Persona Q, his first time working with a deformed Chibi style due to its links with the Etrian Odyssey series, Soejima took into account what fans felt about the characters. A crucial part of his design technique was looking at what made a character stand out, then adjusting those features so they remained recognizable even with the redesign.|$|E
