Man Chong wrote a {{memorial}} to the emperor: [...] "Cao Xiu may be wise and decisive, but he has little experience in battle.

[...] Before Man Chong's memorial reached Cao Rui, however, Cao Xiu and his army had already entered Wuqiangkou, where Wu forces blocked the path and forced them to turn back. As they came under attack while retreating, Zhu Ling showed up with reinforcements to cover their retreat. The Wu forces became fearful upon seeing the arrival of Wei reinforcements, so they retreated as well. Cao Xiu thus managed to escape with his life.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2009, Chad was scripted {{as the son}} of Bill and Marsha Peterson. In June 2009 it was {{announced}} that David Leisure had been cast in the recurring role of D.A. Woods. In October 2009, the character's name was revised to Chad Peterson Woods when D.A. Woods was revealed to be his father. In February 2010 Soap Opera Digest reported that veteran soap actress, Jessica Tuck, known for her role as One Life to Live's Megan Gordon was cast in the role of Chad's mother. Deidrick explained that Chad goes to Kate for answers because she has been a [...] "mother figure." [...] Both the actor and executive producer Gary Tomlin enjoyed Chad's scenes with Koslow's Kate. Chad immediately confronts Madeline and he is [...] "completely devastated" [...] when she admits to being a former prostitute. Chad is fed up with his mother's lies and just wants everything out on the table. The revelation really impacts him in an [...] "inexplicable" [...] way. Deidrick described Chad's reaction as [...] "flabbergasted" [...] and wants to get away from her. When Chad witnesses Madeline's fall, he freezes for a moment because he is unable to [...] "process" [...] the situation. Such tragedy could have the potential to screw him up. Because Deidrick did not know the pain of losing a parent, let alone his own mother, the actor does his best to portray Chad during the scenes; Deidrick's first reaction as Chad <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>into</b> denial. Chad clings on to the little bit of courage he has left hoping to work things out with Charles in the future. According to Deidrick, the aftermath of his mother's death and his confrontation with Charles makes Chad a little [...] "cuckoo crazy." [...] Knowing Chad is all alone in the world Kate schemes to expose that Chad is Madeline's son with Kate's husband, Stefano DiMera (Joseph Mascolo) born on March 3, 1990, making him a whole year older than was initially said to be. The storyline showcased two very distinct sides to Chad's personality. According to Deidrick, during scenes with Kate, he intentionally emphasized Chad's vulnerabilities due to his mother's recent death; he is in desperate need of a mother figure at the moment, and Kate fills that void. Chad does not show that side of his personality too often for fear of getting hurt. On the other hand, Chad's relationship with his new found father Stefano appears to be a bit more volatile. The nature of the relationship is first displayed in November 2010 when Chad confronts Stefano with a knife and demands blood for a DNA test. Chad has no idea how to react to the DNA results. According to Deidrick, [...] " [...] struggles to find the courage to be able to love [...] who had a relationship with his mother and never knew he existed." [...] Deidrick explained that Chad rejects Stefano based on instinct. It is all he knows thanks to D.A. Woods who always pushes him away when things get difficult. However, Stefano is not easily turned away. Deidrick expected the role to be short lived thinking the character was only to wrap up the baby switch storyline. However, he accredited Gary Tomlin with fighting for the character and believing in him as an actor. Deidrick said that it was Tomlin's idea to attach him to a main family, [...] "So they made [...] a DiMera." ...|$|E
