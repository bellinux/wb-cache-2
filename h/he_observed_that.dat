5|$|David Darts {{discussed}} Not in Front of the Children in {{an article}} for Studies in Art Education, and wrote that queries over artistic value as balanced against a desire to protect attendees of educational institutions from perceived harm repeatedly came up over {{time in the history}} of censorship. <b>He</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> the rationale for justifying censorship of artwork from children was based upon similar reasons dating back from Plato to contemporary times, namely anxiety that youth would become corrupted by viewing products deemed inappropriate.|$|E

5|$|He {{showed that}} {{coloured}} light {{does not change}} its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects, and that regardless of whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same colour. Thus, <b>he</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> colour {{is the result of}} objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton's theory of colour.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Compton {{was awarded}} {{one of the}} first two National Research Council Fellowships that allowed {{students}} to study abroad. He chose to go to Cambridge University's Cavendish Laboratory in England. Working with George Paget Thomson, the son of J. J. Thomson, Compton studied the scattering and absorption of gamma rays. <b>He</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> the scattered rays were more easily absorbed than the original source. Compton was greatly impressed by the Cavendish scientists, especially Ernest Rutherford, Charles Galton Darwin and Arthur Eddington, and he ultimately named his second son after J. J. Thomson.|$|E

5|$|Punic was {{spoken at}} the highest level of society: the emperor Septimius Severus (reigned 193–211) was born in Leptis Magna and spoke Punic as well as Latin and Greek, while his sister {{supposedly}} had little command of Latin at all. Augustine, who was from North Africa, several times mentions Punic; <b>he</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> it was related to Hebrew and Syriac, and his knowledge of Punic helped him figure out transliterated Semitic words from the Bible.|$|E
5|$|From his {{extensive}} fieldwork and research experience, Dani refuted any influence of South Indian culture on the Indus Valley Civilization. Using a geographic {{perspective of the}} socio-political systems and cultural distribution of the Indus Basin and surrounding hinterland, <b>he</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> the Indo-Gangetic Plain did not play any {{significant role in the}} development of Indus Valley culture. Nor was there any invasion from the seaside during the Bronze Age, although the coastline facilitated maritime trade. The major influence, according to Dani, came from Central Asia in the west. He asserted that the hilly western borderland that appears as a boundary to the external eye is actually a network of hill plateaus where the local people have always moved freely. He therefore argued that the cultural history of Pakistan is more closely related to Central Asia through Buddhist, Persian and later Sufi influences. He strove to revive this relationship by promoting organisations such as the Pak-Central Asia Friendship Association.|$|E
5|$|In mid-September Bostock {{gained the}} {{agreement}} of Kenney's headquarters to deploy No.80 Wing to the recently captured island of Morotai in the NEI {{as part of a}} redeployment of RAAF units in the SWPA. While this raised morale within No.80 Wing, it had only a short time to prepare to move overseas. On 8November Caldwell received orders to begin the movement to Morotai as soon as possible, and he visited the island late that month. During this visit <b>he</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> it was likely that supply shortages would impede the wing's operations. No.80 Wing's headquarters left Darwin on 9December and No.452 Squadron departed on 15December. During the squadron's trip to Morotai three Spitfires were destroyed or damaged as a result of landing accidents at Merauke, New Guinea on 15December. As expected, living facilities at Morotai were initially very basic, and Caldwell traded liquor for the services of US engineer units to improve the wing's camp site.|$|E

5|$|Starting in March 1984, Congress chaired {{a series}} of {{hearings}} into FX. William Schneider, Jr., the Under Secretary of State for Security Assistance, Science and Technology, testified that FX policy might not result in any sales, in spite of any government support. He stated that the sales of arms such as FX was primarily a matter of foreign policy, secondarily a commercial venture. Thomas V. Jones, Northrop's CEO, argued {{that there was little}} point independently developing aircraft if companies were reliant on the government to sell them. He suggested the FX concept be dropped, and F-20 allowed to be sold by the vendor. Additionally, Brigadier General Thomas Baker, USAF Director of International Programs, testified that the Air Force was not actively marketing FX. <b>He</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> over four years the US had sold 100 fighters to 29 countries, none were FX. He also compared France's aircraft exports, showing a market for a low-cost fighter existed. In the Committee's concluding remarks, the State Department and DOD were accused of rhetoric, and lacking support, on FX.|$|E
5|$|The New Yorker {{film critic}} Anthony Lane {{reflected}} on the sketch and Belushi's performance in 2013. Lane thought that the sketch was an effective satire of the cancellation of the series and simultaneously served as a death knell for the Star Trek franchise. He felt that viewers watching the sketch in 1976 {{would be hard-pressed to}} imagine a future, thirty-seven-years later, where Star Trek was so thoroughly ensconced within popular culture. Lane wrote that Belushi was flawless in his role parodying Shatner playing Kirk. <b>He</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> Belushi both performed an effective parody, while simultaneously injecting his own weariness into the Kirk character. Lane wondered how the Star Trek franchise could ever come back from the total deconstruction the SNL skit presented.|$|E
5|$|WWV's 20MHz {{signal was}} used for a unique purpose in 1958: to track the {{disintegration}} of Russian satellite Sputnik I after the craft's onboard electronics failed. Dr. John D. Kraus, a professor at Ohio State University, knew that a meteor entering the upper atmosphere leaves in its wake {{a small amount of}} ionized air. This air reflects a stray radio signal back to Earth, strengthening the signal at the surface for a few seconds. This effect is known as meteor scatter. Dr. Kraus figured that what was left of Sputnik would exhibit the same effect, but on a larger scale. His prediction was correct; WWV's signal was noticeably strengthened for durations lasting over a minute. In addition, the strengthening came from a direction and at a time of day that agreed with predictions of the paths of Sputnik's last orbits. Using this information, Dr. Kraus was able to draw up a complete timeline of Sputnik's disintegration. In particular, <b>he</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> satellites do not fall as one unit; instead, the spacecraft broke up into its component parts as it moved closer to Earth.|$|E
50|$|William McDougall {{disagreed}} with Shand's view, <b>observing</b> <b>that</b> Shand himself recognized that sorrow was itself derived from simpler elements. To support this argument, <b>he</b> <b>observes</b> <b>that</b> grief, at a loss, {{is a form}} of sorrow where there is no impulse to repair injury, and that therefore there are identifiable subcomponents of sorrow. <b>He</b> also <b>observes</b> <b>that</b> although {{there is an element of}} emotional pain in sorrow, there is no such element in pity, thus pity is not a compound made from sorrow as a simpler component.|$|R

5|$|Louis Pasteur {{was unable}} to find a causative agent for rabies and speculated about a {{pathogen}} too small to be detected using a microscope. In 1884, the French microbiologist Charles Chamberland invented a filter (known today as the Chamberland filter or the Pasteur-Chamberland filter) with pores smaller than bacteria. Thus, he could pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter and completely remove them from the solution. In 1892, the Russian biologist Dmitri Ivanovsky used this filter to study what is now known as the tobacco mosaic virus. His experiments showed that crushed leaf extracts from infected tobacco plants remain infectious after filtration. Ivanovsky suggested the infection might be caused by a toxin produced by bacteria, but did not pursue the idea. At the time it was thought that all infectious agents could be retained by filters and grown on a nutrient medium– this was part of the germ theory of disease. In 1898, the Dutch microbiologist Martinus Beijerinck repeated the experiments and became convinced that the filtered solution contained a new form of infectious agent. <b>He</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> the agent multiplied only in cells that were dividing, but as his experiments did not show that it was made of particles, he called it a contagium vivum fluidum (soluble living germ) and re-introduced the word virus. Beijerinck maintained that viruses were liquid in nature, a theory later discredited by Wendell Stanley, who proved they were particulate. In the same year Friedrich Loeffler and Paul Frosch passed the first animal virus– agent of foot-and-mouth disease (aphthovirus)– through a similar filter.|$|E
5|$|McCauley {{was raised}} to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1955 New Year Honours. In October 1956, he gave a {{presentation}} on air power concepts that was attended by Prime Minister Menzies, {{as well as the}} other Australian service chiefs. McCauley identified Malaya and Indochina, particularly Vietnam, as likely areas for future RAAF deployments, advocating a continued presence in Singapore in view of its strategic importance to the defence of Australia, as he had witnessed first-hand during World WarII. He also recommended that a supersonic light bomber replace the straight-winged and obsolescent English Electric Canberra, primarily for interdiction in Southeast Asia. McCauley's tenure as CAS saw the beginning of a trend for the RAAF to equip with US aircraft types in preference to British types, with recommendations being put forward for the F-104 Starfighter (though in the event the French Dassault MirageIII was purchased) and C-130 Hercules. This stemmed partly from his inspection of Allied air force units during the Korean War, when <b>he</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> those employing American hardware were far better served with spare parts and replacement aircraft than those with British equipment. Some of his senior commanders had urged replacing the Canberra with Avro Vulcan heavy bombers, but McCauley did not pursue this option, preferring to concentrate in the short term on new fighter technology. He also made a point of supporting the Australian aircraft industry wherever feasible.|$|E
