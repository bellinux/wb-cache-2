5|$|At {{the time}} the service was inaugurated, the LNC's trains were divided both by class and by religion, with {{separate}} Anglican and Nonconformist sections and separate first, second and third class compartments within each. This separation applied to both living and dead passengers. This was to prevent persons from different social background from mixing and potentially distressing mourners and to prevent bodies of persons from different social classes being carried in the same compartment, rather than to provide different levels of facilities for different types of mourner; the compartments intended for all classes and religions were very similar <b>in</b> <b>design,</b> <b>and</b> the primary difference was different ornamentation on the compartment doors. At 11.35am (11.20am on Sundays) the train would leave London for Brookwood, arriving at Necropolis Junction at 12.25pm (12.20pm on Sundays).|$|E

Under his direction, the UERL's Underground network and associated bus services expanded considerably reaching out into new areas and stimulating the growth of London's suburbs. His impact on the growth of London between the world wars led to him being likened to Baron Haussmann and Robert Moses.|$|E
5|$|The {{generators}} were {{manufactured by}} two joint ventures: {{one of them}} Alstom, ABB Group, Kvaerner, and the Chinese company Haerbin Motor; the other Voith, General Electric, Siemens (abbreviated as VGS), and the Chinese company Oriental Motor. The technology transfer agreement was signed together with the contract. Most of the generators are water-cooled. Some newer ones are air-cooled, which are simpler <b>in</b> <b>design</b> <b>and</b> manufacture and are easier to maintain.|$|E
5|$|The maltings were {{constructed}} to designs by Herbert A. Couchman, Bass & Co.'s chief engineer. Built in red brick with Welsh slate roofing, the complex follows a rectangular plan along an east-west orientation: a central four-storey water tower {{is flanked by}} four malthouses. Behind the tower is a tall, octagonal chimney. The malthouses are identical <b>in</b> <b>design</b> <b>and</b> layout; barley was fed into a granary section, before being moved onto the germination floors and eventually transported {{to one of the}} twin kilns, where malting took place. Their southern fronts consisted of a six-storey building of five bays with a gable spanning three windows that faces the other ranges. Projecting northwards is a ten-bay section of four-storeys which formed the germination floors.|$|E

5|$|The three ironclad ships {{selected}} differed substantially <b>in</b> <b>design</b> <b>and</b> {{degree of}} risk. Monitor {{was the most}} innovative design {{by virtue of its}} low freeboard, shallow-draft iron hull, and total dependence on steam power. The riskiest element of its design was its rotating gun turret, something that had not previously been tested by any navy. Ericsson's guarantee of delivery in 100 days proved to be decisive in choosing his design despite the risk involved.|$|E
5|$|Accordingly, William de Valence {{began to}} build a much larger castle around the {{original}} keep from the 1280s onwards, demolishing Marshal's earlier work. As part of the extremely expensive construction work, Valence used oak trees drawn from several royal forests. Valence was building {{at the same time}} that his nephew Edward I was constructing his major castles in the north of Wales, and the concentric castle that he built at Goodrich is both very similar <b>in</b> <b>design</b> <b>and</b> a rarity in England itself. Valence's son, Aymer de Valence built an additional line of outer defences before his death in 1324, including the external barbican, inspired by that at the Tower of London, and for which the earlier Valence barbican at Pembroke may have been an experimental forerunner. The effect was an early success in converting a fortress into a major dwelling, without damaging its defensive arrangements, and influenced the later castle conversion at Berkeley.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, the Government of Canada {{announced}} that the Imperial War Graves Commission had awarded Canada eight sites—five in France and three in Belgium—on which to erect memorials. Each site represented a significant Canadian engagement, and the Canadian government initially decided that each battlefield be treated equally and commemorated with identical monuments. In September 1920, the Canadian government formed the Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission to discuss the process and conditions for holding a memorial competition for the sites in Europe. The commission held its first meeting on 26 November 1920 and during this meeting decided that the architectural design competition {{would be open to}} all Canadian architects, designers, sculptors, and artists. The jury consisted of Charles Herbert Reilly representing the Royal Institute of British Architects, Paul Philippe Cret representing the Société centrale des architectes français and Frank Darling representing the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada. Each jury member was a leader in the architectural field; Reilly was training students <b>in</b> <b>design</b> <b>and</b> development of war memorials, and Cret had been selected by the United States to design national monuments in Europe. Interested parties submitted 160 design drawings, and the jury selected 17submissions for consideration, commissioning each finalist to produce a plaster maquette of their respective design. The jury recommended in a 10 September 1921 report to the commission that two of the designs be executed. In October 1921, the commission formally selected the submission of Toronto sculptor and designer Walter Seymour Allward as the winner of the competition; the design submitted by Frederick Chapman Clemesha was selected as runner-up. The complexity of Allward's design precluded the possibility of duplicating the design at each site. The approach of selecting one primary memorial ran counter to the recommendation of Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission architectural advisor Percy Erskine Nobbs, who had consistently expressed his preference for a series of smaller monuments. The consensus went in Allward's favour, his design receiving both public and critical approval. The commission revised its initial plans and decided to build two distinctive memorials—those of Allward and Clemesha—and six smaller identical memorials.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, two less {{powerful}} T single-car units were built, {{designed to be}} prototypes used on the Oslo Tramway. After a one-year trial, they were put into scheduled traffic to the Kolsås Line, where they remained in regular service until 1983. The production series is somewhat different <b>in</b> <b>design</b> <b>and</b> performance. T1000 is both {{used to refer to}} the class as a whole, or the first 162 cars, that are only equipped with third-rail shoes. They have four slight variations, which have been given the designations T1–T4. The T1300 is a series of 33 new and sixteen rebuilt T4 trains equipped with pantographs which previously allowed them operate on {{the western part of the}} network, prior to it being upgraded to third-rail metro standards. The newer units were designated T5 and T6, while the rebuilt units were designated T7 and T8.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of the New Kingdom, Pharaoh Akhenaten {{promoted}} the god Aten over all others and eventually abolished the official worship of most other gods. Traditional temples were neglected while new Aten temples, differing sharply <b>in</b> <b>design</b> <b>and</b> construction, were erected. But Akhenaten's revolution was reversed soon after his death, with the traditional cults reinstated and the new temples dismantled. Subsequent pharaohs dedicated still more resources to the temples, particularly Ramesses II, the most prolific monument-builder in Egyptian history. As the wealth of the priesthoods continued to grow, so did their religious influence: temple oracles, controlled by the priests, were an increasingly popular method of making decisions. Pharaonic power waned, and in the eleventh century BC a military leader, Herihor, made himself High Priest of Amun and the de facto ruler of Upper Egypt, beginning the political fragmentation of the Third Intermediate Period (c. 1070–664BC).|$|E

The House included four bedrooms each varying <b>in</b> <b>design</b> <b>and</b> comfort. The Head of Household bedroom featured a penthouse design with a waterfall and a faux ocean front view while the first bedroom featured a VIP club lounge design, while the second bedroom resembled the bottom of a public pool and featured a slide and beds that were designed to look like flotation devices. The third room initially used by the HouseGuests was later turned into the Have-Not room, which was a simplistic gray bedroom with metal slabs used as beds.|$|E
