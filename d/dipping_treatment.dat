40|$|Abstract. Pumpkin (Cucuribita Spp.) fruit slices were {{subjected}} to pre-drying treatments and drying using methods of uncontrolled sun and oven drying. The two-way interaction between drying methods and pre-drying treatments had significant effect on chemical qualities. Pumpkin subjected to salt solution <b>dipping</b> <b>treatment</b> and oven dried had higher chemical concentrations. Among the pumpkin fruit accessions, pumpkin accession 8007 had the superior TSS after drying. Among the three pre-drying treatments, salt solution <b>dipping</b> <b>treatment</b> had significant effect and the most efficient pre-drying treatment to retain the quality of dried pumpkin fruits without significant chemical quality deterioration. Salt <b>dipping</b> <b>treatment</b> combined with low temperature (60 °C) oven air circulation drying is recommended to maintain quality of dried pumpkin slices. Integrated pre-and postharvest treatment including the genetic factor was shown to have {{significant effect on the}} drying kinetics as well as quality after drying of pumpkin...|$|E

In both {{treatments}} the dry matter yield and formation of microsclerotia were determined for aerial parts. In plants grown in infested soil, the DW and microsclerotia formation were determined in stubbles and roots as well. The highest numbers of microsclerotia per g plant material and per pot in the root <b>dipping</b> <b>treatment</b> were found on potato, flax and barley. The microsclerotia density on potato cv. Element, pea and barley was higher in the root <b>dipping</b> <b>treatment</b> than in the soil infestation treatment. The reverse was true for potato cultivars Ostara and Mirka. Dry matter yield of the harvestable organs of potato cultivars Element and Astarte, flax, sugarbeet and barley was lower in the root <b>dipping</b> <b>treatment</b> than in the soil infestation treatment. The greatest inter-crop differences in the microsclerotia yield/pot were in the aerial parts. Flax gave the highest numbers of microsclerotia/pot, followed by the 4 potato cultivars.

40|$|Purpose – A major {{challenge}} facing the fresh-cut industry is maintaining and preserving {{the quality of}} minimally processed or fresh-cut produce. A low temperature regime, although insufficient, has been the main method of overcoming this challenge so far. Thus, methods preserving the quality and extending the shell life of minimally processed or fresh-cut produce are needed. This paper seeks to propose that honey {{could be used to}} preserve the fresh-like quality of minimally processed pomegranate arils and extend their shelf life. Design/methodology/approach – Manually extracted pomegranate arils were treated with water as control, 10 or 20 per cent diluted honey solution each for five minutes, then held at 4 8 C for ten days. Changes in organoleptic and visual quality, softening, soluble solids content, pH, absorbance at 446 and 510 nm, and total aerobic count were recorded during the ten-day storage period.

Some commonly used substances are calcium chloride, ascorbic acid, cysteine and citric acid, in immersed inchemical mixtures. Recent studies have demonstrated the possibility of preserving fresh-cut banana immersed in sweetened fruit juice for relatively longer periods, favoring commercialization.

Similarly, uninoculated or artificially inoculated fruit subjected to B. amyloliquefaciens, 1 -MCP or a combination of the two treatments was stored at 10 ºC for 18 days under conventional storage. ‘Tommy Atkins’ fruit were packed into bags made from four different film types, untreated or after being subjected to a cold B. amyloliquefaciens <b>dip</b> <b>treatment</b> and stored for 23 days at 10 ºC. Overall, ‘Kent’ fruit were more susceptible to anthracnose and SBR after artificial inoculation. In vivo inoculated ‘Tommy Atkins’ fruit, storage under CA- 1 gave the best control of soft brown rot whilst CA- 2 storage gave the best control of anthracnose. For quality retention no definite conclusion could be made for both cultivars after CA storage or the combination of 1 -MCP pre-treatment and CA storage. The combination of 1 -MCP pre-treatment and B. amyloliquefaciens maintained the quality of ‘Kent’ mangoes under conventional storage the best.

40|$|Induced {{resistance}} {{has been}} recognised as an attractive tool for plant disease management in modern agriculture. During {{the last two}} decades, studies on chemically- and biologically-elicited induced resistance have revealed previously unknown features of the plant defence response including defence priming. As a biological trigger for induced resistance, plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are a group of root-associated bacteria that can reduce plant disease severity and incidence, and augment plant growth and yield under greenhouse and field conditions. We evaluated the potential of an endophytic PGPR, Bacillus pumilus INR 7, to induce systemic resistance against bacterial spot caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. vesicatoria in pepper. Trials in the greenhouse showed significantly less symptom development in pepper plants inoculated with strain INR 7 compared to a water treatment. Furthermore, a single <b>dipping</b> <b>treatment</b> with INR 7 before transplantation of pepper plants into the field elicited an induced systemic resistance (ISR) response against bacterial spot caused by artificially infiltration of X. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria and even against naturally occurring bacterial spot disease. We identified an additiveeffect on induced resistance after administration of a combination treatment composed of strain INR 7 with a chemical inducer, benzothiadiazole (BTH) in the field. The combination treatment stimulated expression of pepper defence marker genes CaPR 1, CaTin 1, and CaPR 4 {{to a greater extent}} than did treatment with either agent alone. Similar experiments conducted with tobacco revealed no additive effects under field conditions. Interestingly, co-application of plants with INR 7 lifted the growth repressing effect of BTH.

The use of combined instrumental acoustic-mechanical techniques and the measurement of the absorption coefficient at 670 nm (μa 670) by time-resolved reflectance spectroscopy (TRS) have been shown useful to assess fruit crispness and the maturity degree. The aim of this work was to evaluate {{the influence of the}} maturity degree measured by TRS, modified atmosphere and anti-browning dipping on the texture of fresh-cut apples as measured by means of an instrumental mechanical-acoustic test and the rheological behavior of the cell wall material. Apples were measured at harvest by TRS at 670 nm, ranked on the basis of decreasing μa 670 (increasing maturity) and classified as less mature (LeM), medium mature and more mature (MoM). Only LeM and MoM apples were peeled and cut, half of them were dipped in the antibrowning solution and the other were not dipped. All samples were packed using air or 80 % Ar + 20 % CO 2 modified atmosphere (MA). Ethylene concentration and instrumental mechanical-acoustic characteristic were evaluated after 1, 4, 8, 11 and 15 d of refrigerated storage (4 °C). The rheological behavior of cell wall material was evaluated after 1 and 15 d. LeM and MoM samples showed a different ethylene evolution for fresh-cut apples packed in air. The mechanical-acoustic results showed that the maturity degree influenced the texture significantly, with LeM apples firmer and more rigid and producing also a higher number of acoustic events with more elevated maximum signal amplitude than MoM fruit. However maturity degree did not affect the evolution of texture throughout storage. Both <b>dipping</b> <b>treatment</b> and MA did not affect texture clearly. The rheological behavior of the cell wall material suggested an increase of elastic behavior with storage time. In order to obtain a fresh-cut product with homogeneous texture characteristics, these results suggest that it would be beneficial to process fruits of a homogeneous maturity class, which could be achieved by sorting using TRS...|$|E
40|$|Eggs from a broiler {{breeder flock}} between 25 and 29 weeks of age were dipped into {{solutions}} of various concentrations of ascorbic acid (AA) {{for up to}} 2 min, in order to evaluate its effects on eggshell conductance (EC), amniotic fluid pH, albumen height and pH, embryonic weight and hatchability. 2. Three experiments were conducted and the following treatments were used: control, non-dipped (CND); control, water-dipped (CWD); 10 g AA/l (AA 1); 20 g AA/l (AA 2) and 30 g AA/l (AA 3). Measurements of EC before and after dipping were made in experiments 1 and 2 in eggs from hens at 25 and 27 weeks of age, respectively. Albumen height and pH were measured after dipping the eggs in experiment 2. In experiment 3, egg weight loss, embryonic weight and amniotic fluid pH at 14 d of age, hatchability percentage (HP), and embryonic mortality were measured in eggs from hens at 29 weeks of age. 3. AA treatment of eggs and dipping period of time (1, 1 • 5 and 2 min) increased EC of eggs from hens at 25 and 27 weeks of age. 4. AA 3 treatment for 2 min reduced albumen height and increased albumen pH of eggs {{when compared with the}} CND treatment in eggs from hens at 27 weeks of age. 5. HP of AA 1 -treated eggs from hens at 29 weeks of age was higher than that of the CND treatment. AA 2 and AA 3 treatments of eggs reduced HP and increased the percentage of non-pips when compared with any of the other treatments. 6. AA 2 and AA 3 treatments of eggs increased egg weight loss when compared with the control treatments (CND and CWD). <b>Dipping</b> <b>treatment</b> did not influence amniotic fluid pH or embryo weight expressed as a percentage of initial egg weight. 7. It is concluded that dipping hatching eggs into AA solution increased EC of eggs. Dipping eggs into 10 g AA/l for a period of 2 min increased HP in eggs from hens at 29 weeks of age, although this was not associated with a significant ncrease in egg weight loss...|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of different sulfite-based treatments to prevent melanosis in fresh deepwater pink shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris) was evaluated. Increasing {{the concentration of}} sulfites, different methods of application (immersion and dust) and synergy with other compounds, such as citric acid and chelants, were investigated. The level of SO 2 residues in the muscle was determined in a selection {{of the most effective}} <b>treatments.</b> One-hour <b>dip</b> <b>treatment</b> with 50 g kg- 1 sulfite, together with citric acid and chelants, was effective for melanosis prevention for at least one week. With this treatment, the statutory limit of 0. 3 g kg - 1 SO 2 in edible part was not exceeded by the majority of samples analysed. © 2005 Society of Chemical Industry. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

The clear film-forming coatings, such as polyurethane and alkyds, were typically greater than 90 percent effective for specimens dip treated with penta in mineral spirits. Two-component (epoxy type) pigmented coatings were effective on specimens treated with penta in P 9 type A oil. Coatings that wre not compatable with P 9 oil were the least effective in preventing penta vaporization. All coatings tested on specimens treated with penta in methylene chloride were greater than 90 percent effective in reducing vaporization...|$|R
