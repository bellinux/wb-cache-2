50|$|There are two {{different}} types of backup supported: <b>File</b> <b>backup</b> and system image. File backups are saved to ZIP files. Two methods of <b>file</b> <b>backup</b> are supported: The first, normal backup, stores everything selected for backup. The second, incremental backup stores only files that are changed after a previous backup. The other method of backup, system image, is a disk image of the backed up system saved block by block in a VHD file (versus file by file in the <b>file</b> <b>backup</b> and NTBackup). Block-based backup is more efficient at performing subsequent differential backups, as only the blocks that have changed need to be backed up.|$|E
