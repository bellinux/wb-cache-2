5|$|Morales {{and other}} {{officers}} meet with psychiatrist Dr. Kress at a restaurant, where {{he explains that}} the Phantom is a highly intelligent sadist with a strong sex drive, {{between the ages of}} 35 and 40. As Kress expresses his doubts about their chances of capturing the Phantom, the Phantom's shoes are shown, revealing that he had heard the entire conversation. At the station, a man named <b>Johnson</b> <b>says</b> that he was robbed and forced to drive a man to Lufkin at gunpoint. While on the road, Ramsey receives a report about an armed suspect, and a brief chase ensues. The suspect, Eddie LeDoux, at first denies everything, then confesses to being the Phantom, but Morales is unconvinced. Johnson identifies him as his robber.|$|E
500|$|Beauchamp's {{plan was}} {{complicated}} by a warrant sworn out against him by Ruth Reed. She sued him for support of her illegitimate son, born on June 10, 1824, claiming {{he was the}} father. [...] Beauchamp later said he had ignored the warrant, dated October 25, 1825, {{on the advice of}} a friend who termed it harassment. He also said he had arranged for the warrant, as an excuse to be in Frankfort to kill Sharp. The historian Fred <b>Johnson</b> <b>says</b> that Beauchamp likely added the warrant into his story after the fact, as a means of damage control. It hardly looked good for him to have committed the act for which he ostensibly killed Sharp.|$|E
500|$|Johnson opposes {{federal and}} state gun control {{legislation}}, saying: [...] "I'm {{a firm believer in}} the Second Amendment and so I would not have signed legislation banning assault weapons or automatic weapons." [...] <b>Johnson</b> <b>says</b> that the Second Amendment [...] "was designed to protect us against a government that could be very intrusive. And in this country, we have a growing police state - if people can own assault rifles or automatic rifles, I think leads to a more civil government." [...] Johnson would, however, limit weapons such as rocket launchers. Johnson believes that allowing concealed carrying of guns reduces crime and gun violence. He opposes barring gun sales to individuals on the no-fly list, because he claims that such lists have a high error rate. Johnson has called for a [...] "thousand-person taskforce" [...] or [...] "hot line" [...] to prevent terrorists from obtaining guns, and has questioned why the perpetrator of the Orlando nightclub shooting was not [...] "deprived of his guns" [...] after being interviewed three times.|$|E

500|$|The film's {{stature and}} {{following}} has grown steadily since its original release, and {{it now has}} cult movie status. [...] Director Martin Scorsese placed The Haunting first on his list of the 11 scariest horror films of all time. Richard <b>Johnson</b> <b>says</b> that Steven Spielberg considers The Haunting one of the [...] "seminal films" [...] of his youth, and Robert Wise says that Spielberg told him The Haunting was [...] "the scariest film ever made!" [...] Richard Armstrong in Rough Guide to Film (2007) called it [...] "one of the most frightening films ever made", and said Julie Harris' performance is played [...] "with an intensity that is frightening in itself". In 2010, The Guardian newspaper ranked it as the 13th-best horror film of all time. However, not all critics think so highly of the film; Yoram Allon and Neil LaBute have stated that they believe the film is [...] "frankly overrated", and professional filmmaker Russell Evans has argued that few people truly find the film shocking or disturbing. As of October 2014, review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes scores the film with an 86% rating based on 36 reviews. The film was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Director (Robert Wise).|$|E
2500|$|Howard Blum {{wrote in}} The New York Times that, from 1976 onwards, party members sent {{reports to the}} FBI and local police on members of left-wing organizations. In 1977, he wrote, {{commercial}} reports on U.S. anti-apartheid groups were prepared by LaRouche members for the South African government, student dissidents were reported to the Shah of Iran's Savak secret police, and the anti-nuclear movement was investigated on behalf of power companies. <b>Johnson</b> <b>says</b> the intelligence network {{was made up of}} [...] "obnoxious devotees commandeering WATS lines and tricking bureaucrats into giving them information." [...] By the late 1970s, members were exchanging almost daily information with Roy Frankhouser, a government informant and infiltrator of both far right and far left groups who was involved with the Ku Klux Klan and the American Nazi Party.|$|E

[...] Jane was then escorted from her lodgings to the scaffold where she spoke before kneeling on the just-used scaffold. [...] Despite her nervous collapse over the previous five months, she was calm and dignified and both women won mild posthumous approval for their behaviour. [...] One eyewitness, a merchant named Ottwell Johnson, wrote that their 'souls [...] be with God, for they made the most godly and Christian end.' The French ambassador Marillac merely stated that Jane gave a 'long discourse'; <b>Johnson</b> <b>says</b> that she apologised for her 'many sins', but neither man's account supports the later legend that she spoke at length about her late husband or sister-in-law. [...] According to Alison Weir, the dead queen was {{not much more than}} seventeen {{at the time of her}} death and Jane was about thirty-six.|$|E

2500|$|At a dawn inspection, Thomas {{found that}} Negley's {{division}} had not arrived {{to support the}} regulars. Rosecrans promised to send them, which he had not done before as Thomas had requested and expected. Rosecrans discovered that Negley's division was facing {{a large body of}} Confederates so he ordered Brigadier General Thomas J. Wood to replace Negley in the line and for Negley to remain in place until relieved, except that Negley should send his reserve brigade to the north to reinforce the regulars immediately. Upon arrival {{at the end of the}} line, that brigade was sent beyond the end of the line in anticipation of Negley's other brigades' imminent arrival, when in fact they were not yet on the way. Colonel Joseph Dodge's brigade was nearby and was hastily moved to the end of the regular's line. They had no time to throw up even the most elementary defenses before being forced into action. The Confederates in fact soon attacked the Union left but they did so in a piecemeal and disorganized manner that allowed the regulars to defend their position with few initial casualties. Then the Confederates turned their attention from the regulars and were able to rout Brigadier General Samuel Beatty's brigade from Negley's division. Beatty's recently arrived brigade was strung out north of the end of the line held by Dodge and the regulars. The advancing Confederates turned down the La Fayette Road to deliver a flanking attack, which scattered Dodge's men after they had fired only one volley. The regulars deployed to cover their flank as they were strongly attacked. The stiff attack caused some of the 18th U.S. Infantry's men to begin to fall back. Historian Mark W. <b>Johnson</b> <b>says</b> it was at this point that the 18th received [...] "a one-man reinforcement," [...] Private William J. Carson, bugler of the 1st Battalion, Company E, 15th U.S. Infantry.|$|E

6000|$|Of all the carping, cross-grained, scandal-loving, Whiggish assailants of Alma Mater, {{the author}} of Terrae Filius was the most persistent.

What strikes one most in Terrae Filius is the religious discontent of the bilious author. One thinks, foolishly of course, of even Georgian Whigs as orthodox men, at least in their undergraduate days. The mere aspect of Mr. Leslie Stephen's work on the philosophers of the eighteenth century is enough to banish this pleasing delusion. The Deists and Freethinkers had their followers in Johnson's day among the undergraduates, though scepticism, like Whiggery, was unpopular, and might be punished. <b>Johnson</b> <b>says,</b> that {{when he was a boy}} he was a lax TALKER, rather than a lax THINKER, against religion; [...] "but lax talking against religion at Oxford would not be suffered."

6000|$|Dr. Johnson {{does not}} appear {{sufficiently}} attentive to the true character and nature of pastoral poetry. No doubt it is natural for a young poet to initiate himself by pastorals; for what youthful heart does not glow at the descriptions of rural nature, and scenes that accord with its own innocency and cheerfulness; but although pastorals do not, {{in the sense of}} Dr. Johnson, imitate real life, nor require any great insight into human passions and characters, yet there are many things necessary in this species of composition, more than Dr. Johnson seems to require. The chief thing is an eye for picturesque and rural scenery, and an intimate acquaintance with those minute and particular appearances of nature, which alone can give a lively and original colour to the painting of pastoral poetry. To copy the common descriptions of spring or summer, morning or evening, or to iterate from Virgil the same complaints of the same shepherds, is not surely to write pastoral poetry. It is also difficult to conceive where is [...] "the close thought" [...] with which <b>Johnson</b> <b>says</b> Pope's Pastorals are composed. They are pleasing as copies of [...] "the poems of antiquity," [...] although they exhibit no striking taste in the [...] "selection," [...] and they certainly exhibit a series of musical versification, which, till their appearance, had no precedent in English poetry. If in particular passages, I have ventured to remark that Pope has introduced false thoughts and conceits, let us remember that we ought not so much to wonder that he admitted any, as that they were not more. Dryden's earlier poems are infinitely more vitiated in this respect.|$|E
6000|$|Faulkner, the Dublin printer, told Dr. Birch, in 1749, that James Worsdale was {{the person}} who went to Curll, by Pope's direction, {{in the habit of}} a clergyman.[82] Before the entry in Birch's diary was published, Dr. Johnson had given the same account in his [...] "Lives of the Poets."[83] Worsdale was a painter, dramatist, and actor, and, as if his triple calling was {{insufficient}} for his versatile disposition, he followed a fourth, and was hired, <b>Johnson</b> <b>says,</b> to conduct clandestine negotiations. When an attempt was made to extort money from the second son of Sir Robert Walpole, he was engaged to mix with the conspirators, to win their confidence, and to betray it. They were convicted of the fraud, and Worsdale, in giving his evidence, [...] "acted with so much life and spirit the several parts he had performed during the time of sifting out the mystery as gave no small diversion to the court."[84] According to Horace Walpole, the poet had employed this personator and detector of rogues in his more reputable capacity, to make several copies of a portrait of Atterbury.[85] He seemed formed to carry on the traffic with Curll, and since it was his profession to aid in plots, he might be expected to be a secret as well as a willing assistant. Johnson, who attached some weight to his evidence, says he was of doubtful veracity,--an objection which would have applied to the disclosures of any representative of Smythe; for no upright man would have played a part in a scheme of deception. His assertion would have been worthless, if it had stood alone; but it at least falls in with the numerous circumstances which all conjoin to criminate Pope.|$|E
6000|$|Let us here {{read what}} old <b>Johnson</b> <b>says</b> of these meadows in his [...] "Wonder-working Providence," [...] {{which gives the}} account of New England from 1628 to 1652, and see how matters looked to him. He says of the Twelfth Church of Christ {{gathered}} at Concord: [...] "This town is seated upon a fair fresh river, whose rivulets are filled with fresh marsh, and her streams with fish, it being a branch of that large river of Merrimack. Allwifes and shad in their season come up to this town, but salmon and dace cannot come up, by reason of the rocky falls, which causeth their meadows to lie much covered with water, the which these people, together with their neighbor town, have several times essayed to cut through but cannot, yet it may be turned another way with an hundred pound charge as it appeared." [...] As to their farming he says: [...] "Having laid out their estate upon cattle at 5 to 20 pound a cow, {{when they came to}} winter them with inland hay, and feed upon such wild fother as was never cut before, they could not hold out the winter, but, ordinarily the first or second year after their coming up to a new plantation, many of their cattle died." [...] And this from the same author [...] "Of the Planting of the 19th Church in the Mattachusets' Government, called Sudbury": [...] "This year [does he mean 1654] the town and church of Christ at Sudbury began to have the first foundation stones laid, taking up her station in the inland country, as her elder sister Concord had formerly done, lying further up the same river, being furnished with great plenty of fresh marsh, but, it lying very low is much indamaged with land floods, insomuch that when the summer proves wet they lose part of their hay; yet are they so sufficiently provided that they take in cattle of other towns to winter." ...|$|E
