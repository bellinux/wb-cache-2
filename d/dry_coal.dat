Different methods of drying were investigated to determine whether <b>coal</b> <b>drying</b> can be accomplished without reducing the reactivity of <b>coals</b> toward liquefaction. <b>Drying</b> methods included thermal, microwave, and chemical dehydration.

Thermal and microwave drying appear to cause a collapse in the pore structure, thus preventing donor solvents such as tetralin from contacting reactive sites inside the coals. Chemical dehydration does not appear to collapse the pore structure.

The best-fit solutions indicate that the coal volume decreases upon drying. The microscopic shrinkage estimated using helium expansion was greater than the shrinkage reported using the bed-height technique.

50|$|In {{order to}} thrive, a fire {{requires}} fuel, oxygen, and heat. As underground fires {{are very difficult}} to reach directly, firefighting involves finding an appropriate methodology which addresses the interaction of fuel and oxygen for the specific fire in question. A fire can be isolated from its fuel source, for example through firebreaks or fireproof barriers. Many fires, particularly those on steep slopes, can be completely excavated. In the case of near-surface coal seam fires, the influx of oxygen in the air can be interrupted by covering the area or installing gas-tight barriers. Another possibility is to hinder the outflow of combustion gases so that the fire is quenched by its own exhaust fumes. Energy can be removed by cooling, usually by injecting large amounts of water. However, if any remaining <b>dry</b> <b>coal</b> absorbs water, the resulting heat of absorption can lead to re-ignition of a once-quenched fire as the area dries. Accordingly, more energy must be removed than the fire generates. In practice these methods are combined, and each case depends on the resources available. This is especially true for water, for example in arid regions, and for covering material, such as loess or clay, to prevent contact with the atmosphere.|$|E

30|$|A major {{drawback}} {{to the use}} of brown coal as a carrier material, however, is its high moisture content (typically 60 – 70  % for brown coals mined in Victoria, Australia). This makes transportation of brown coal prohibitively expensive and thus makes <b>drying</b> of the <b>coal</b> an essential process. <b>Dried</b> brown <b>coal</b> is prone to crumble into a fine dust when handled, increasing its propensity to undergo spontaneous combustion. This introduces further difficulties for handling and storage. <b>Dried</b> brown <b>coal</b> granules of suitable strength and resistance to attrition may be a viable solution to these issues. The granulation process provides a method for the addition of N fertiliser in either liquid or solid form.|$|R
40|$|Almost 50 % of the world’s coal {{resources}} are low rank coals. Efficiency for low rank coal utilization {{is reduced by}} high moisture contents and can decrease the conventional power plant efficiency by up to 9 %. <b>Drying</b> <b>coal</b> is an effective way of increasing the efficiency of low rank coal combustion for power generation. A drying technology for use with Victorian brown coal is steam fluidized bed drying. However fundamental drying data is required for scaling up steam fluidized bed drying to a commercial scale. This study generates the data and also provides {{an understanding of the}} kinetics on fluidized bed drying in general, and steam fluidized bed drying in particular. Water in Victorian brown coal consists mainly of non-freezable and bulk water whereas similar coals such as Chinese lignite only contains bound and non-freezable water. The structure of bound water in Chinese Shenhua lignite also differs from that in Victorian brown coals –Loy Yang, Yallourn and Morwell–, displaying two separate freezing temperatures (- 36 °C and - 48 °C) compared to Victorian brown coal’s one (- 47 °C). When re-introducing water to <b>dried</b> <b>coal,</b> non-freezable water returns to previous levels, while the bound water is reduced. The difference in re-wetted coal-water interactions affects the energy requirements for re-wetted coals, and can impact agglomeration and slurry processes when water is added to coal. Observing different size fractions, smaller fractions exhibit lower bulk water mass, however the non-freezable and bound water mass remains relatively unchanged. The kinetics of both air and steam fluidized bed drying of Victorian brown coal show that increasing the fluidization velocity and bed temperature or decreasing the particle size results in a lower drying time. This trend occurs regardless of the fluidization medium, with drying ratio’s between drying temperatures and fluidization velocities remaining consistent between air and steam fluidization mediums. Through experiments in a 1 kg bed a drying time of 30 minutes was established to completely <b>dry</b> the <b>coal</b> and represents a practical drying time closer to commercial driers. To reconcile laboratory and larger drying kinetics a scaling co-efficient of 1. 33 has been created in conjunction with a modified Page model. This model accurately describes the scaling of drying in a small steam fluidized bed to a large steam fluidized bed. Analysis of the chemical characteristics of <b>dried</b> <b>coal</b> indicates that the oxygen functional groups change with temperature. Synchrotron infrared experiments of single particle drying in Nitrogen indicates that functional group breakdown of Victorian brown coals occur between 140 and 250 °C, while Chinese lignite’s begin to break down at 160 °C. The loss of functional groups was also dependent on the residence time. At 130 °C longer residence times show Chinese Shenhua lignite showing faster and different functional group loss than Yallourn brown coal. At 170 °C a drop in COOH dimers is seen after 15 minutes, with additional functional group loss occurring at 25 minutes. These results show Shenhua lignite is more temperature sensitive and should be dried at temperatures below 200 °C to avoid major functional group loss. During steam fluidized bed drying particle breakage occurs, with a 100 μm drop in average particle diameter observed. However a 100 μm average particle size drop occurs regardless of drying medium or method and is attributed to the transition from bulk/bound water to non-freezable water and not fluidization. At 30 and 60 minutes residence time, air fluidization decreases the average particle diameter by an additional 75 μm, while steam fluidization has no additional effect. Moisture re-adsorption of Victorian brown coal shows steam fluidized bed <b>dried</b> <b>coal</b> re-adsorbs up to 2 % less moisture than air fluidized bed <b>dried</b> <b>coals</b> (9. 6 % vs. 7. 6 % for Loy Yang brown coal), and has been attributed to the change in oxygen functional groups. Unlike previously developed engineering models, a single particle model for steam drying has been developed for implementation into computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Using a lumped, master curve approach, a model has been developed to describe the surface temperature and moisture content of a <b>coal</b> particle during <b>drying.</b> This provided comparable results to other drying models in the literature, with a significantly simpler calculation method. The form of the equations allows for modelling of local dryer conditions and has practical applications in drier design and optimization. The characteristics of the <b>dried</b> <b>coal</b> were investigated through the combustion and gasification reactivity along with the ignition point analysis. The change in drying temperature and fluidization medium make no observable impact on either the reactivity or ignition point. This proves steam fluidized bed drying maintains similar combustion and gasification properties of <b>dried</b> <b>coal</b> when compared to other forms of drying. This thesis characterised the steam fluidized bed drying process, allowing for an accurate prediction of the output coal quality, from the moisture content to the resultant coal properties to the coals usability in combustion and gasification processes. ...|$|R
