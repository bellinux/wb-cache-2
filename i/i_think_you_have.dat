500|$|After he {{beat the}} Mariners on short (three days') rest at the {{beginning}} of August for the team lead in wins, Seattle manager Don Wakamatsu said: [...] "I thought Feldman was awfully tough.

500|$|Idol {{hoped to}} advance the way stagecraft and {{lighting}} were used at rock concerts. [...] "Part of {{the idea is to}} create an element of visible language," [...] Idol explained during an interview with the New York Times, [...] "so that you feel as if you're being talked to through images. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to start looking to get to the future of what rock-and-roll concerts should be like. We're working; we're pushing the technology to the edge." ...|$|E

500|$|Due to the high-pitch {{employed}} in the recording, Dickson reflected in later years that she [...] "never liked the original [...] for that reason. The song has seasoned over the years with my singing of it." [...] Dickson believed {{that she did not}} sound like herself on the song. While performing it later point of time on her concerts, Dickson sang it in her actual tone, saying that although the track [...] "might have been written for a teenage girl, but the experience of being abandoned by a man is one, women of all ages can relate to. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to be honest with songs and with yourself." [...] The singer's music director Ian Lynn arranged the track differently which she performs currently.|$|E
500|$|In early 2001, Spears {{said that}} she had plans to make her film debut. She and her team then created a concept for it, which was later {{developed}} by Grey's Anatomy creator Shonda Rimes. Spears commented that she [...] "talked to [...] and told her what I wanted the movie to be about and she elaborated on it. It was my little project. When you do a movie, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to be really passionate about it. I was having a lot of offers, but this is something my heart was into." [...] A press conference was held during the Marché International du Disque et de l'Edition Musicale (MIDEM) in Cannes, France, on January 19, 2002, where Spears also premiered the film.|$|E
500|$|In early 2001, Spears and {{her team}} {{developed}} a script for a movie where the singer could be the main role. [...] "I talked to [...] and told her what I wanted the movie to be about and she elaborated on it," [...] Spears said. [...] "It was my little project. When you do a movie, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to be really passionate about it. I was {{having a lot of}} offers, but this is something my heart was into." [...] After finishing the script, the movie, which was later titled Crossroads, had the working titles of What Are Friends For and Not a Girl. [...] "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman", written by Dido, Max Martin and Rami, was originally intended to be included on the movie's soundtrack, but after JIVE Records decided not to release a soundtrack, Spears later decided to use it on her third studio album, Britney (2001).|$|E

Mr. Eames, you must excuse me if I say that I am not well enough this evening to bear the company of--everybody. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better leave me. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better go." ...|$|R

500|$|The filming {{schedule}} {{was intended to}} last 138 days but grew to 160. Many cast members came down with colds, flu, or kidney infections after spending hours in cold water, including Winslet. In the end, she decided she would not work with Cameron again unless she earned [...] "a lot of money". Several others left the production, and three stuntmen broke their bones, but the Screen Actors Guild decided, following an investigation, that nothing was inherently unsafe about the set. Additionally, DiCaprio {{said there was no}} point when he felt he was in danger during filming. Cameron believed in a passionate work ethic and never apologized for the way he ran his sets, although he acknowledged:I'm demanding, and I'm demanding on my crew. In terms of being kind of militaresque, I think there's an element of that in dealing with thousands of extras and big logistics and keeping people safe. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to have a fairly strict methodology in dealing with a large number of people.|$|E
500|$|In {{an impromptu}} {{interview}} following the match, a clearly upset Solo criticized Ryan's decision. [...] "It {{was the wrong}} decision, and I think anybody that knows anything about the game knows that. There's {{no doubt in my}} mind I would have made those saves. And the fact of the matter is it's not 2004 anymore. It's not 2004. And it's 2007, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to live in the present. And you can't live by big names. You can't live in the past. It doesn't matter what somebody did in an Olympic gold medal game in the Olympics three years ago. Now is what matters, and that's what I think." [...] Many viewed her comments as being critical of Scurry's performance, although Solo released an apologetic statement the following day saying that was not her intent. On September 29, 2007, coach Greg Ryan announced that Solo would not be with the team and would not play in the third-place match against Norway the following day. Team captain Kristine Lilly stated that the decision on Solo was made by the team as a group. The U.S. went on to win against Norway 4–1.|$|E
2500|$|According to a 2006 Newsweek interview, [...] "For Graham, {{politics}} is a secondary to the Gospel.... When Newsweek asked Graham whether ministers—whether they {{think of themselves as}} evangelists, pastors or a bit of both—should spend time engaged with politics, he replied: 'You know, I think in a way that has to be up to the individual as he feels led of the Lord. A lot of things that I commented on years ago would not have been of the Lord, I'm sure, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> some—like communism, or segregation, on which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a responsibility to speak out.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|... “What {{happened}} in this trial, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{to put it in}} the context of federal conspiracy law, where the government doesn’t have to prove that something happened, but just that people agree that something should happen in the future. In this case, it was even more strained. The crime charged in this case was actually an agreement to agree to do something in the future. So when you’re dealing with a charge like that, you’re not going to have—or the government’s not going to be required to produce the kind of evidence that you would expect in a normal criminal case.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Andrew Lloyd Webber {{chose to}} save Niamh and {{eliminate}} Keisha. Before announcing his decision he said, [...] "First, I'm {{going to say}} this is a complete and utter travesty, neither of you should be in the bottom two, it's completely wrong. I've been put into a situation that I have never wanted to be in. For the first time on a television show, I am angry." [...] And after choosing to eliminate Keisha, he told her, [...] "You were absolutely wonderful. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a huge career ahead of you and all I can say is that I'll do anything I can to help you." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to their outstanding success on the court, Gottlieb's 2012–13 California team became nationally known as a team that had fun, while also keeping focus. Senior leader Layshia Clarendon cut her hair into what became a trademark mohawk, and the team wrote, produced, and starred in their own music video, [...] "Started from the Bottom." [...] Coach Gottlieb explained: [...] "My philosophy in general is that college athletics should be an enjoyable experience for {{the people involved in}} it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to embrace this team's nature of being fun-loving. You have to empower them to enjoy the experience. I can do that because I'm so confident in their focus. They're creative, and they're smart kids. If anything, I think that when they're happier and enjoying it, they're more likely to play hard and play well." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ever since {{losing in}} the semi-finals at Wimbledon, Evert had an intense focus on Forrest Hills, which this marked {{the third year}} the US Open would be {{conducted}} on clay at the 1977 US Open. [...] Evert {{made it to the}} final to face Australian Wendy Turnbull, which Evert would put her focus into practice and win the final by a score of 76, 62. [...] Evert said of winning all three events at the US Open contested on clay that it was very important to do so because Evert said [...] "I want to stay on top, to be No. 1, and to be No. 1 <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to win a major title. [...] This was my chance." [...] This was Evert's third consecutive US Open victory, and her seventh grand slam title for her career.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to these, a Hall of Fame chief executive said, [...] "The definition of 'rock and roll' means {{different things to}} different people, but as broad as the classifications may be, they all share a common love of the music." [...] Roger Glover remains ambivalent about induction and got an inside word from the Hall, [...] "One of the jurors said, ‘You know, Deep Purple, they’re just one-hit wonders.’ How can you deal with that kind of Philistinism, you know?". Ian Gillan also commented, [...] "I've fought all my life against being institutionalised and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to actively search these things out, in other words mingle with the right people, and we don't get invited to those kind of things." [...] On 16 October 2013 Deep Purple were again announced as nominees for inclusion to the Hall, and once again they were not inducted.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Carrie, [...] "that was {{not meant}} to be conciliatory. It rather emphasises the {{distinction}} <b>you</b> mention. Still, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> not finished." ...|$|R
