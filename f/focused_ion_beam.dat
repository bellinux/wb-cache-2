25|$|Another {{group of}} nanotechnological {{techniques}} include those used for fabrication of nanotubes and nanowires, {{those used in}} semiconductor fabrication such as deep ultraviolet lithography, electron beam lithography, <b>focused</b> <b>ion</b> <b>beam</b> machining, nanoimprint lithography, atomic layer deposition, and molecular vapor deposition, and further including molecular self-assembly techniques such as those employing di-block copolymers. The precursors of these techniques preceded the nanotech era, and are extensions {{in the development of}} scientific advancements rather than techniques which were devised with the sole purpose of creating nanotechnology and which were results of nanotechnology research.|$|E

25|$|One major {{disadvantage}} of the {{transmission electron microscope}} {{is the need for}} extremely thin sections of the specimens, typically about 100 nanometers. Creating these thin sections for biological and materials specimens is technically very challenging. Semiconductor thin sections can be made using a <b>focused</b> <b>ion</b> <b>beam.</b> Biological tissue specimens are chemically fixed, dehydrated and embedded in a polymer resin to stabilize them sufficiently to allow ultrathin sectioning. Sections of biological specimens, organic polymers and similar materials may require staining with heavy atom labels in order to achieve the required image contrast.|$|E
25|$|Ion beam milling – thins samples {{until they}} are {{transparent}} to electrons by firing ions (typically argon) at the surface from an angle and sputtering material from the surface. A subclass of this is <b>focused</b> <b>ion</b> <b>beam</b> milling, where gallium ions are used to produce an electron transparent membrane in a specific region of the sample, for example through a device within a microprocessor. Ion beam milling may {{also be used for}} cross-section polishing prior to SEM analysis of materials that are difficult to prepare using mechanical polishing.|$|E
25|$|More {{recently}} <b>focused</b> <b>ion</b> <b>beam</b> {{methods have}} been used to prepare samples. FIB is a relatively new technique to prepare thin samples for TEM examination from larger specimens. Because FIB can be used to micro-machine samples very precisely, it is possible to mill very thin membranes from a specific area of interest in a sample, such as a semiconductor or metal. Unlike inert gas ion sputtering, FIB makes use of significantly more energetic gallium ions and may alter the composition or structure of the material through gallium implantation.|$|E

40|$|Compared to photomasks, X-ray {{masks are}} much more {{sensitive}} to mechanical damage, especially to process-induced distortions due {{to the use of}} thin silicon membranes (typically 2 mu m). One of several possible causes for such distortions is the repair of opaque defects using <b>focused</b> <b>ion</b> <b>beams</b> (FIB). The extent to which distortions are induced by the repair process has been investigated. Extensive experiments have shown that the repair process of opaque defects using <b>focused</b> <b>ion</b> <b>beams</b> does not significantly influence the pattern placement accuracy on X-ray masks...|$|R

2500|$|The {{samples are}} {{required}} to have a needle geometry and are produced by similar techniques as TEM sample preparation electropolishing, or <b>focused</b> <b>ion</b> <b>beam</b> methods. [...] Since 2006, commercial systems with laser pulsing have become available and this has expanded applications from metallic only specimens into semiconducting, insulating such as ceramics, and even geological materials.|$|E
2500|$|As TEM samples cannot {{typically}} {{be viewed}} at a full 180° rotation, the observed images typically {{suffer from a}} [...] "missing wedge" [...] of data, which when using Fourier-based back projection methods decreases the range of resolvable frequencies in the three-dimensional reconstruction. Mechanical refinements, such as multi-axis tilting (two tilt series of the same specimen made at orthogonal directions) and conical tomography (where the specimen is first tilted to a given fixed angle and then imaged at equal angular rotational increments through one complete rotation in {{the plane of the}} specimen grid) can be used to limit the impact of the missing data on the observed specimen morphology. Using <b>focused</b> <b>ion</b> <b>beam</b> milling, a new technique has been proposed which uses pillar-shaped specimen and a dedicated on-axis tomography holder to perform 180° rotation of the sample inside the pole piece of the objective lens in TEM. Using such arrangements, quantitative electron tomography without the missing wedge is possible. In addition, numerical techniques exist which can improve the collected data.|$|E
