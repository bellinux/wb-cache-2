50|$|These {{limitations}} {{are the reasons}} why large high crown panels such as wings and fenders are often made in many pieces. The pieces are then welded together usually with one of two processes. TIG welding (Tungsten Inert Gas) produces less <b>heat</b> <b>distortion,</b> but produces a harder, more brittle weld that may cause problems when planishing/smoothing by hand, or in the wheeling machine. Oxy-acetylene welding joints don't have this drawback, provided {{they are allowed to}} cool to room temperature in air, but do produce more <b>heat</b> <b>distortion.</b> Panel joints may be achieved using autogenous welding - that is welding without filler rod (Oxy-acetylene or TIG processes), this is useful when finally smoothing the welding joints as it reduces the amount filing/grinding/linishing needed or almost eliminates it altogether. It also, more importantly, reduces <b>heat</b> <b>distortion</b> of the surface contour, which must be corrected on the wheel or with hammer and dolly.|$|E

After a sustained search of varied sites all over Southern California, undertaken at the instigation {{and support of}} physicist Robert Leighton, he chose to build an observatory near {{the north shore of}} Big Bear Lake, where placing the telescope surrounded by water would minimize the <b>heat</b> <b>distortions</b> arising from the ground (a common drawback in other solar observatories). Entrepreneurial in spirit, with a small grant from Caltech and money from the Fleischmann Foundation, Zirin built supporting facilities on shore, a dome on an island in the lake (though a year or so later, a causeway was built, connecting the island to the shore, as it remains), and built the telescopes for observing. Despite Zirin’s driving nature, the Big Bear Solar Observatory had a congenial atmosphere, and there were always summer positions for students. Their usefulness led Zirin to propose to Caltech what became the extremely successful Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program. Zirin also had a series of multi-year post-doctoral fellows.|$|R

Laser welding techniques both reduce <b>heat</b> <b>distortions</b> and allow for new structural solutions. The project aims at the development and exploitation of laser welded sandwich panels in the shipbuilding industry. Emphasis was put on the following aspects: Installation of a prototype laser welding station and development of the welding process. Development of a quality assurance system and qualification of the panels. Investigations on operational properties of sandwich panels and development of design solutions. Assembly and subsequent manufacturing processes for sandwich panels in a shipyard environment. Laser welded sandwich panels have already been used in newbuilding ships. e. g. by Meyer Werft, and in other industries. Due to their improved properties and modulare premanufacturing techniques sandwich panels are competitive against conventional stiffened plates. (orig.)

40|$|Joining {{processes}} {{are an important}} key factor for the competitiveness of European shipbuilders. They not only represent {{a significant portion of}} the total man hour consumption in hull production and outfitting, but due to <b>heat</b> <b>distortions</b> they also have a significant impact on nonproductive work operations, such as straightening and fitting. Those operations can interfere with on-board outfitting and increase lead time and construction cost. In addition to their contribution to shipyard productivity, joining techniques have a significant impact on material properties and thus on product performance and quality. Those factors become increasingly important for complex structures using comparatively thin and high-strength materials. Considering the importance of efficient joining, European shipbuilders in the past decade have invested significant efforts to develop new joining techniques, such as laser welding, adhesive bonding, and mechanical joining. Based on research re sults, practical industrial applications have been developed recently. After reviewing the impact of joining processes on competitiveness, the article will summarize a number of past and ongoing research projects with special focus on design methods, process and equipment development, fatigue strength of joints, quality assurance, and approval.

40|$|Discoveries of extrasolar {{planets in}} the {{habitable}} zone (HZ) of their parent star lead {{to questions about}} the habitability of massive moons orbiting planets in the HZ. Around low-mass stars, the HZ is {{much closer to the}} star than for Sun-like stars. For a planet-moon binary in such a HZ, the proximity of the star forces a close orbit for the moon to remain gravitationally bound to the planet. Under these conditions the effects of tidal <b>heating,</b> <b>distortion</b> torques, and stellar perturbations become important considerations for exomoon habitability. Utilizing a model that considers both dynamical and tidal interactions simultaneously, we performed a computational investigation into exomoon evolution for systems in the HZ of low-mass stars (≲ 0. 6 M_). We show that dwarf stars with masses ≲ 0. 2 M_ cannot host habitable exomoons within the stellar HZ due to extreme tidal heating in the moon. Perturbations from a central star may continue to have deleterious effects in the HZ up to ≈ 0. 5 M_, depending on the host planet's mass and its location in the HZ, amongst others. In addition to heating concerns, torques due to tidal and spin distortion can lead to the relatively rapid inward spiraling of a moon. Therefore, moons of giant planets in HZs around the most abundant type of star are unlikely to have habitable surfaces. In cases with lower intensity tidal heating the stellar perturbations may have a positive influence on exomoon habitability by promoting long-term heating and possibly extending the HZ for exomoons.

50|$|Braze welding {{has many}} {{advantages}} over fusion welding.

Additionally, since the metals joined are not melted in the process, the components retain their original shape; edges and contours are not eroded or changed by the formation of a fillet. Another effect of braze welding is the elimination of stored-up stresses that are often present in fusion welding. This is extremely important in the repair of large castings. The disadvantages are the loss of strength when subjected to high temperatures and the inability to withstand high stresses.|$|E

5000|$|In 1960, Perazzi met Ivo Fabbri, a young {{automotive}} engineer {{who worked for}} Fiat. The two joined together to create high class, yet affordable shotguns. They were inspired by the British gun makers Boss & Co. and Woodward, who made firearms by hand with extravagant prices. Perazzi and Ivo believed {{there was a way}} to create such high class firearms that would be affordable for the average Italian. The pair then began to work with Italian shooting star and gun designer, Ennio Mattarelli. From this partnership the first Olympic grade Perazzi shotgun was born, which Mattarelli used to win the gold medal in Olympic trap at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics with a world record score of 198/200 targets. A year later Fabbri separated from Perazzi to establish his own firearm company, Fabbri Arms. Perazzi continued to work with Mattarelli. The two focused on developing a new shotgun for Mattarelli to shoot at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics. The model MX8 shotgun was born, built specifically for the conditions of shooting in Mexico City. The gun featured a higher rib and respective higher stock to reduce <b>heat</b> <b>distortion</b> along the sight plane in the hot climate. Doing so lowered to the placement of the stock on the shoulder, resulting in the recoil being directed horizontally back into the shooter, rather than vertical muzzle jump. A pistol grip was included to increase the control over traditional straight English stocks. The MX8 {{was also one of the}} first guns to have interchangeable screw in chokes in the bottom barrel. This feature is now found in nearly every modern shotgun. Also included was the revolutionary detachable v-springs trigger assembly. Perazzi preferred v-springs over the traditional coil trigger assembly due to their better trigger pulls. The draw back of v-springs was their unreliability. When worn out they can break without warning, unlike the coil trigger assemblies they slowly wear down with age. Since the v-spring assembly was detachable, they could be changed at any time by the competitor for peace of mind. This innovation along with slanted hammers reduced misfires significantly.|$|E
