5|$|Gebeachan (died 937), {{also known}} as Gébennach, and Gebechán, was a tenth-century King of the Isles. <b>He</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been a {{subordinate}} to Amlaíb mac Gofraid, King of Dublin, and is recorded to have fought and died at the Battle of Brunanburh in 937.|$|E
5|$|Maximus {{continues}} to be the guard's greatest steed in arresting criminals in all of Corona. <b>He</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> feelings for a female horse named Fidel.|$|E
5|$|Whatever {{the cause}} of Themistocles's unpopularity in 479BC, it {{obviously}} did not last long. Both Diodorus and Plutarch suggest he was quickly restored to the favour of the Athenians. Indeed, after 479 BC, <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> enjoyed a relatively long period of popularity.|$|E
60|$|I {{remarked that}} <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> carried them out once before.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{hurt himself}} very much, for he gave another furious roar.|$|R

5|$|Although Ravel {{wrote for}} mixed choirs and male solo voices, he is chiefly associated, in his songs, with the soprano and {{mezzo-soprano}} voices. Even when setting lyrics clearly narrated by a man, he often favoured a female voice, and <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> preferred his best-known cycle, Shéhérazade, to be sung by a woman, although a tenor {{voice is a}} permitted alternative in the score.|$|E
5|$|Peter of Bruys {{admitted}} the doctrinal {{authority of the}} Gospels in their literal interpretation; the other New Testament writings <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> considered valueless, as he doubted their apostolic origin. He questioned the Old Testament and rejected {{the authority of the}} Church Fathers and that of the Roman Catholic Church itself. Petrobrusians also opposed clerical celibacy, infant baptism, prayers for the dead, and organ music.|$|E
5|$|When Histiaeus {{heard of}} the fall of Miletus, <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{appointed}} himself as leader of the resistance against Persia. Setting out from Byzantium with his force of Lesbians, he sailed to Chios. The Chians refused to receive him, so he attacked and destroyed the remnants of the Chian fleet. Crippled by the two defeats at sea, the Chians then acquiesced to Histiaeus's leadership.|$|E
60|$|At last <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> strung {{himself for}} an effort, and spoke, without looking up.|$|R
60|$|He said no more; <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{forgotten}} {{that there was}} another person in the room.|$|R
60|$|Bruin {{was evidently}} {{out for an}} evening stroll, for <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> nothing {{particular}} <b>to</b> do.|$|R
5|$|Although Theobald was a monk, his episcopal {{household}} was not monastic in character. As {{he settled}} {{into the role of}} archbishop, <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> left most of his monastic habits behind, although he continued to have a monk as a companion. His nephews and brother benefited from his nepotism, with his nephews becoming part of his household early in his archepiscopate. The four nephews—Guillaume, Gilbert, Roger and Lechard—were witnesses to a charter of Theobald's dated to about 1150 or 1153. After Theobald's death, Guillaume was a clerk in Bartholomew, the Bishop of Exeter's household in around 1172.|$|E
5|$|Nigel died on 30 May 1169. In either 1164 or in 1166, or {{possibly}} both, {{he had been}} struck by paralysis, and after this <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> withdrawn from active affairs. He took little part in the disputes between the king and Thomas Becket, although he did agree with his fellow bishops who opposed the king's attempt to reduce clerical benefits. He may have been buried at Ely, where a 12th-century marble slab possibly marks his tomb.|$|E
5|$|Philip had no {{intention}} of handing over Amphipolis to the Athenians, but acted as if he was just delaying the transfer of the city. <b>He</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> gone straight on to besiege Pydna after capturing Amphipolis. The Athenians, perhaps still hoping to receive Amphipolis if they allowed Philip to take Pydna, do not seem to have tried to intervene (and may not have been able to). Pydna seems to have fallen to Philip by treachery, in either 357 or 356 BC.|$|E
60|$|The man {{shifted his}} feet nervously. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> come <b>to</b> the {{difficult}} part of his story.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{regained his}} old spirit. It {{was as if}} a last flame were {{flickering}} up.|$|R
60|$|It struck Dick {{that the}} man was suspiciously prompt; indeed <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been waiting for the request.|$|R
5|$|Schubert {{had been}} {{struggling}} with syphilis since 1822–23, and suffered from weakness, headaches and dizziness. However, <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> led a relatively normal life until September 1828, when new symptoms such as effusions of blood appeared. At this stage he moved from the Vienna home of his friend Franz von Schober to his brother Ferdinand's house in the suburbs, following {{the advice of his}} doctor; unfortunately, this may have actually worsened his condition. However, up until the last weeks of his life in November 1828, he continued to compose an extraordinary amount of music, including such masterpieces as the three last sonatas.|$|E
5|$|After {{serving in}} office for an extra year to 1905, Clarke retired, having helped to create a better system {{for the benefit of}} all. While the Colonial Office sought to mediate {{conflicts}} of interest, its impact was varied due to its desire to avoid expense. Milner was preoccupied with his vision of a new South Africa incorporating Southern Rhodesia, for which he needed the support of the BSAC. He appears to have had respect for Clarke, although <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> resented his influence at the Colonial Office, denying him an increase in salary or an official secretary. On Clarke's retirement, Milner wrote 'Personally I hardly think the office of Resident Commissioner any longer necessary'.|$|E
5|$|At 21:30 Forte and the {{captured}} merchant ships were visible from Sybille, Forte brilliantly illuminated {{in the tropical}} night. Cooke brought Sybille westwards {{in order to take}} the weather gage before wearing and bearing down on the French ship, under a light wind from the southwest. Despite the illumination on the French ship, Sybilles sails were clearly identified on Forte but Beaulieu gave no orders to prepare for action: <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> thought that the sails belonged to an approaching East Indiaman despite the concerns of his officers, or that he wished to lure Sybille close enough to ensure its defeat in the coming engagement.|$|E
60|$|Phipps {{leaned against}} the back of a chair. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> aged ten years in the last few days.|$|R
60|$|We {{had reached}} the Doctor's gate. The Doctor pushed it open and passed in. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{forgotten}} me.|$|R

5|$|By then, Exton had in turn {{been elected}} Mayor. Although {{for a while}} he and Brembre worked {{together}} in running London, when his predecessor fell from influence, Exton effectively deserted him, {{even to the point of}} being partially responsible for Brembre's eventual hanging. Exton's primary policy throughout his two periods as Mayor was probably based on a desire to maintain the city's neutrality between the feuding parties. On the other hand, he appears to have personally profited from the Appellants' period of rule, and it seems that there was some dissatisfaction with him in London, even if he was subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing by parliament. His later years are as obscure as his youth; known to have married at least twice, <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had no children, and died in 1402 at an unknown age.|$|E
5|$|Descartes {{argued that}} God's {{existence}} can be deduced from his nature, just as geometric ideas can be deduced {{from the nature}} of shapes—he used the deduction of the sizes of angles in a triangle as an example. He suggested {{that the concept of}} God is that of a supremely perfect being, holding all perfections. <b>He</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> assumed that existence is a predicate of a perfection. Thus, if the notion of God did not include existence, it would not be supremely perfect, as it would be lacking a perfection. Consequently, the notion of a supremely perfect God who does not exist, Descartes argues, is unintelligible. Therefore, according to his nature, God must exist.|$|E
5|$|During the 1640s and 1650s, Velázquez {{served as}} both court painter and curator of PhilipIV's {{expanding}} collection of European art. <b>He</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been given an unusual {{degree of freedom}} in the role. He supervised the decoration and interior design of the rooms holding the most valued paintings, adding mirrors, statues and tapestries. He was also responsible for the sourcing, attribution, hanging and inventory {{of many of the}} Spanish king's paintings. By the early 1650s, Velázquez was widely respected in Spain as a connoisseur. Much of the collection of the Prado today—including works by Titian, Raphael, and Rubens—were acquired and assembled under Velázquez's curatorship.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{heard the}} name before, but still he hesitated. 'Ah--what did he paint?' he asked, with growing caution.|$|R
60|$|He was now always {{quiet and}} decided and remote, very beautiful. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> some strange, cold power over her.|$|R
60|$|And she, obedient, {{began to}} tie the bandage with numb fingers. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> taken the use out of her.|$|R
5|$|Late in 1315 or in 1316, Harclay {{was taken}} captive by the Scots, who demanded 2000 marks in ransom. His {{meteoric}} rise {{over the previous}} years had made him some enemies in local society, who now {{took the opportunity to}} spread slanderous rumours about him at court. The king nevertheless helped raise the necessary money to secure Harclay's freedom, but {{for the next few years}} <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been out of royal favour. It was not until 1319 that he once more was appointed sheriff, and at the same time made keeper of Carlisle and Cockermouth castles, and Warden of the West Marches. In 1321 he also received a personal summons to parliament.|$|E
5|$|Less {{is known}} of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the {{historical}} Stefan Lochner believe {{he was born in}} Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major city occasion. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40.|$|E
5|$|Richard's time as {{archbishop}} {{was much}} less stormy than Becket's had been, and <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had better relations with the king. Richard attended the royal councils, and more than once was with the king in Normandy. Richard was less dogmatic {{on the rights of}} the clergy than his great predecessor had been; but his compromises were regarded by the monastic writers and the followers of Becket as a sign of weakness. Pope Alexander III took Richard to task when Richard acquiesced in the election of bishops taking place in the royal chapel. As part of his diplomatic efforts on the king's behalf, Richard escorted Henry's daughter Joan to Provence on her journey in 1176 to marry King William II of Sicily. Richard also spent part of 1177 in Flanders on diplomatic business for King Henry.|$|E

60|$|The {{shadow of}} {{impending}} disaster <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{found its way}} into Phipps' bones. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> lost alike his courage and his dignity.|$|R
