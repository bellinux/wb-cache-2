5|$|While the {{religious}} hierarchy mirrored the Empire's administrative divisions, the clergy were more ubiquitous than the emperor's servants.

5|$|Christians at {{the time}} of Constantine's {{conversion}} made up only 10% of the population.

A conversion so rapid seems to have been rather the result of expediency than of conviction.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} fourth century Armenia, under king Tiridates III, {{became the first}} country to adopt Christianity as a state religion. A large number of Armenian monks are {{recorded}} to have settled in Jerusalem {{as early as the}} fourth century, after the uncovering of Christian holy places in the city. However, the first written records are from the <b>fifth</b> <b>century.</b> Jerusalem is thus considered the oldest living diaspora community outside the Armenian homeland. Philip Marsden wrote that the survival of Armenians in Jerusalem–"most intense of all cities"—proves their extraordinary resilience.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>fifth</b> <b>century</b> BC, Alcmaeon of Croton in Magna Grecia, first {{considered}} {{the brain to}} be {{the seat of the}} mind. Also in the <b>fifth</b> <b>century</b> BC in Athens, Hippocrates believed the brain to be the seat of intelligence. Aristotle, in his biology initially believed the heart to be the seat of intelligence, and saw the brain as a cooling mechanism for the blood. He reasoned that humans are more rational than the beasts because, among other reasons, they have a larger brain to cool their hot-bloodedness. Aristotle did describe the meninges and distinguished between the cerebrum and cerebellum. Herophilus of Chalcedon in the fourth and third centuries BC distinguished the cerebrum and the cerebellum, and provided the first clear description of the ventricles; and with Erasistratus of Ceos experimented on living brains. Their works are now mostly lost, and we know about their achievements due mostly to secondary sources. Some of their discoveries had to be re-discovered a millennium after their deaths. Anatomist physician Galen in the second century AD, {{during the time of the}} Roman Empire, dissected the brains of sheep, monkeys, dogs, and pigs. He concluded that, as the cerebellum was denser than the brain, it must control the muscles, while as the cerebrum was soft, it must be where the senses were processed. Galen further theorized that the brain functioned by movement of animal spirits through the ventricles.|$|E

5|$|The Lingbao School (Simplified Chinese: 灵宝派; Traditional Chinese: 靈寶派; pinyin: Líng Bǎo Pài), {{also known}} as the School of the Sacred Jewel or the School of Numinous Treasure, was an {{important}} Daoist school that emerged in China in between the Jin Dynasty and the Liu Song Dynasty in the early <b>fifth</b> <b>century</b> CE. It lasted for about two hundred years until it was absorbed into the Shangqing and Zhengyi currents during the Tang Dynasty. The Lingbao School is a synthesis of religious ideas based on Shangqing texts, the rituals of the Celestial Masters, and Buddhist practices.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Languedoc wines {{can be traced}} to the first {{vineyards}} planted along the coast near Narbonne by the early Greeks in the <b>fifth</b> <b>century</b> BC.

5|$|The {{history of}} {{maritime}} trade {{along the coast}} of East Africa dates to the Classical Period. The Periplus Maris Erthraei, written by an Egyptian-Greek merchant circa AD 40–55, described trading ports along the Indian Ocean including Azania, a historic designation of the East African coast extending southward to present day Tanzania. Physical evidence for trade predates the earliest towns in the ninth century with the discovery of four Roman beads from the fourth century and pottery from the <b>fifth</b> <b>century.</b> Roman documents from the first through fifth centuries, as well as, Ptolemy's Geographia also provide historical accounts of trade with East Africa, followed by a dearth of historical documents until the tenth century. After the fall of the Roman Empire in the <b>fifth</b> <b>century,</b> Arab, Indian, and Chinese shipping grew in importance, which was eventually dominated by Persia after its conquest of southern Arabia and Egypt in AD 515 and AD 616. It has been proposed that trade between the Swahili Coast and Persia, as well as later Islamic merchants following the spread of Islam after AD 632, contributed to the settlement and development of the coastal sites.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{church was}} built in the early fourth century—between 301 and 303 according to tradition—by Armenia's patron saint Gregory the Illuminator, following the adoption of Christianity as a state religion by King Tiridates III.

The core of the current building {{was built in}} 483/4 by Vahan Mamikonian after the cathedral was severely damaged in a Persian invasion. From its foundation until {{the second half of the}} <b>fifth</b> <b>century,</b> Etchmiadzin was the seat of the Catholicos, the supreme head of the Armenian Church.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{theories}} about why the hoard was buried. One is that the hoard represented a deliberate attempt to keep wealth safe, perhaps in response to one of the many upheavals facing Roman Britain in the early <b>fifth</b> <b>century.</b> This is not the only hypothesis, however. Archaeologist Peter Guest argues that the hoard was buried because the items in it were used as part of a system of gift-exchange, and as Britain separated from the Roman Empire, they were no longer required. A third hypothesis is that the Hoxne Hoard represents the proceeds of a robbery, buried to avoid detection.|$|E

Christian remains, especially lamps with the monogram XP, prove the presence of a Christian religious community in the area of the sanctuary between the third and <b>fifth</b> <b>centuries</b> AD.|$|R
