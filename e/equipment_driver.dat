40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} {{a method for}} implementing Graphical User Interface (GUI) platform for integrate circuit (IC) equipment controlling software, which includes the following steps: developing corresponding IC <b>equipment</b> <b>driver</b> module and drawing GUI platform interface according to {{the characteristics of the}} IC equipments produced by different manufacturers connecting the monitor mainframe of the IC equipment with a controller through the IC <b>equipment</b> <b>driver</b> module and forming a communication network and, reading/writing controller data through the communication network by the IC <b>equipment</b> <b>driver</b> module, and mapping the data to universal data layer of the GUI platform. The GUI platform interface uses the universal data layer to perform data real-time display, control and abnormity processing, and thus, the GUI platform for the IC equipment control software is implemented. The present invention implements cross-platform mechanism, improves the cluster monitoring capacity of wafer manufacture equipment, satisfies the user demand of flexible construction and configuration of Human-Machine interface of corresponding control system, enables rapid construction of the whole producing process in a short time, and ensure the demand of producing startup ahead of time...|$|E

30|$|For the tested conditions, {{the use of}} MILP {{proves to}} be {{possible}} to achieve energy efficiency gains from the optimal decision-making by analyzing the best configuration of rotating <b>equipment</b> <b>drivers.</b> Real gains from the model application were around 11, 000 US$/day. From historical data, an average earning potential of 1500 US$/day, representing an average gain of 556, 000 US$/year was observed Therefore, the standard deviation is high, so this value should be used carefully.|$|R

40|$|Particular WLAN pathologies {{experienced}} in realistic scenarios {{are hard to}} detect, due to the complex nature of the wireless medium. Prior work has employed sophisticated <b>equipment,</b> <b>driver</b> modifications, or even application-layer techniques, towards diagnosing such pathologies. The key novelty of our approach lies {{in the identification of}} metrics able to characterize the root causes of individual pathologies, while also being directly extractable from MAC-layer statistics available in today’s wireless equipment. Through the development of the proposed framework as application-layer software on top of commercial hardware and its experimental evaluation, we validate the efficiency and applicability of our approach. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015...|$|E

50|$|While {{technically}} {{listed as}} amphibious, the Gama Goat's swimming capability {{was limited to}} smooth water crossings of ponds, canals and streams due to the very low freeboard {{and the lack of}} a propeller. Propulsion in the water was supplied by the six spinning wheels, and bilge pumps were standard <b>equipment.</b> <b>Drivers</b> had to remember to close the hull's drain openings before swimming the vehicles. Some models had extra equipment installed that made them too heavy to swim, such as heavy-duty winches, communications shelters that made them top heavy, or radar gear.|$|R

40|$|New turnkey data {{acquisition}} systems purchased from industry are being integrated into CERN's Technical Data Server. The short time available for system integration {{and the large}} amount of data per system require a standard and modular design. Four different integration layers have been defined in order to easily 'plug in' industrial systems. The first layer allows the integration of the equipment at the digital I/O port or fieldbus (Profibus-DP) level. A second layer permits the integration of PLCs (Siemens S 5, S 7 and Telemecanique); a third layer integrates <b>equipment</b> <b>drivers.</b> The fourth layer integrates turnkey mimic diagrams in the TCR operator console. The second and third layers use two new event-driven protocols based on TCP/IP. Using this structure, new systems are integrated in the data transmission chain, the layer at which they are integrated depending only on their integration capabilities...|$|R

50|$|On July 7, 2007 {{the private}} {{owners in the}} {{community}} turned out in mass to construct a 120 ft long block structure {{in front of the}} old dam, to save the lake and return the lake to normal water levels. The project took months of planning and permitting by private residents and was funded by private donations from homeowners and local businesses. Over 50 residents turned out to help build the dam. Local contractors donated heavy <b>equipment,</b> <b>drivers,</b> and materials. Local establishments donated food, residents fed the workers, and turned out at the site to watch as enormous concrete blocks were hoisted into place. The project started at 6:30 Saturday morning and continued late into the night. Volunteers returned on Sunday to wrap the edges with a protective rubber barrier. The spillway will allow the lake to self regulate its water level, protecting the upstream habitats from draining and allowing fish to flourish. Future plans are to repair the original dam structure and incorporate a fish ladder.|$|R
