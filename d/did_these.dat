5|$|A {{study of}} the fossil remains of large {{carnivores}} from LaBrea pits dated 36,000–10,000YBP shows tooth breakage rates of 5–17% for the dire wolf, coyote, American lion, and Smilodon, compared to 0.5–2.7% for ten modern predators. These higher fracture rates were across all teeth, but the fracture rates for the canine teeth {{were the same as}} in modern carnivores. The dire wolf broke its incisors more often when compared to the modern gray wolf; thus, it has been proposed that the dire wolf used its incisors more closely to the bone when feeding. Dire wolf fossils from Mexico and Peru show a similar pattern of breakage. A 1993 study proposed that the higher frequency of tooth breakage among Pleistocene carnivores compared with living carnivores was not the result of hunting larger game, something that might be assumed from the larger size of the former. When there is low prey availability, the competition between carnivores increases, causing them to eat faster and thus consume more bone, leading to tooth breakage. As their prey became extinct around 10,000 years ago, so <b>did</b> <b>these</b> Pleistocene carnivores, except for the coyote (which is an omnivore).|$|E

5|$|The {{negative}} attitude towards Schubert's piano sonatas persisted {{well into the}} twentieth century. Only around the centennial of Schubert's death <b>did</b> <b>these</b> works begin to receive serious attention and critical acclaim, with the writings of Donald Francis Tovey, and the public performances of Artur Schnabel and Eduard Erdmann. During the following decades, the sonatas, and especially the final trilogy, received growing attention, {{and by the end}} of the century, came to be regarded as essential members of the classical piano repertoire, frequently appearing on concert programs, studio recordings, and musicological writings. Some late twentieth century scholars have even argued that Schubert's last sonatas should rank together with Beethoven's most mature sonatas. The B-flat Sonata, the last of them all, has gained the highest acclaim and popularity among the three.|$|E

25|$|It is {{not certain}} how Artsakh was {{administered}} as a sub-national political entity within Armenia.

Under the rule of Caucasian Albania, Artsakh, while often referred to, was not a recognized political entity. By the 9th century it comprised a number of small political units, including the principalities of Khachen in the center and Dizak in the south.

Only in 1932 and 1948 did they finish above tenth until 1955. With Stuart Boyes and Lofty Herman not fully adequate replacements as bowling mainstays for Kennedy and Newman, the bowling was never strong, and the batting generally uncertain especially when Mead declined from 1929 onwards. In 1937 Dick Moore set the individual scoring record for Hampshire against Warwickshire at Dean Park Cricket Ground in Bournemouth.

25|$|As the {{greatest}} concentrations of Japanese troops in North Borneo {{during the war}} was in fact in the interior areas, repatriation of the soldiers and civilians following the surrender takes several months as it was delayed {{due to the lack}} of shipping. An estimate of around 29,500 remaining Japanese troops spread across the island in both north and southern part. Of the total, 18,600 belong to the IJA while 10,900 to the IJN. Though there were also some Japanese who were unaware over their surrender and moved far further to the inland despite the calling from their supreme commander. Only after more repeated callings from both Allied and Japanese forces <b>did</b> <b>these</b> forces return. The repatriation are mostly been supervised by the Australian as Borneo along with New Guinea, Papua and Solomon Islands were under their responsibility during the liberation mission.

500|$|On February 3, 2014, Marvel [...] "stealth released" [...] a {{one-shot}} tie-in comic, Avengers: Age of Ultron Prelude—This Scepter'd Isle. Written by Will Corona Pilgrim {{and illustrated by}} Wellinton Alves, it reveals how Strucker came into possession of Loki's scepter and {{the origin of the}} Maximoff twins' abilities. At the end of the month, the film's official poster was revealed. Graeme McMillian of The Hollywood Reporter criticized it for its lack of originality, calling it [...] "pretty much the poster for the first Avengers movie, except with added flying robots in the background" [...] {{and the fact that it}} incorporated many of the same tropes the other MCU Phase Two film posters <b>did.</b> <b>These</b> included: the hero(es) staring off camera; destruction in the background as well as something occurring in the sky; and poor Photoshop on the poster, highlighting the fact that each of the actors were obviously photographed separately and were later composited together into the poster. Mendelson agreed with many of McMillian's observations, and called the poster [...] "hilariously photoshopped".|$|E
500|$|Shatner {{conceived}} {{his idea}} for the film's story before he was officially given the director's job. His inspiration was televangelists; [...] "They [...] were repulsive, strangely horrifying, and yet I became absolutely fascinated," [...] he recalled. Shatner was intrigued that not only <b>did</b> <b>these</b> personalities convince others God was speaking directly to them, but they became wealthy by what Shatner considered false messages. The televangelists {{formed the basis for}} the character Zar, later Sybok. Shatner's first outline was titled An Act of Love, and many of its elements— the Yosemite vacation, the abduction of Klingon, human and Romulan hostages on the failed paradise planet— survived to the final film. In Shatner's early draft, Kirk is overwhelmed by Zar's superior numbers of followers and Spock, McCoy {{and the rest of the}} Enterprise crew come to believe in Zar's divinity. Kirk feigns acceptance of Zar's beliefs to travel with him to the God planet, which to Shatner would be a desolate, fiery waste. When Kirk confronts [...] "God", the image of the being transforms into that of Satan, and Kirk, Spock, and McCoy split up in their escape. Kirk eludes capture but goes back to save his friends from being carried away to Hell.|$|E

500|$|Some of the Americans, led by Thompson, {{made their}} way out of the swamp to be confronted by HMS Martin, which drove them back into the swamp with grapeshot. [...] A column of men under Colonel Anthony Wayne fared only a little better, {{arriving}} out of the swamp only to face Fraser's formation. A brief exchange of fire took place: but the Americans, clearly outmatched by Fraser's forces, broke and ran, leaving arms and supplies behind. Portions of the American force retreated to the edge of the woods, which gave them some cover, and attempted to engage some of the British troops: but fire from those troops kept them off the road and fire from some of the ships in the river kept them from the shore. [...] St. Clair and a number of men made it back to the landing site, only to find it occupied by the British troops. Only by returning to the swampy woods and continuing to flee upriver <b>did</b> <b>these</b> men escape capture at that time. [...] Wayne eventually managed to form a rear guard of about 800 men, which attempted an attack on the British position; but they were driven back into the woods. Wayne then led a staggered retreat, in which companies of men slipped away, with the woods giving cover to hide their true numbers.|$|E
500|$|A 2006 study {{published}} in Tax Notes by the Beacon Hill Institute at Suffolk University and Dr. Laurence Kotlikoff [...] estimated the FairTax would be revenue-neutral for the tax year 2007 {{at a rate of}} 23.82% (31.27% tax-exclusive). The study states that purchasing power is transferred to state and local taxpayers from state and local governments. To recapture the lost revenue, state and local governments would have to raise tax rates or otherwise change tax laws in order to continue collecting the same real revenues from their taxpayers. The Argus Group and Arduin, Laffer & Moore Econometrics each published an analysis that defended the 23% rate. While proponents of the FairTax concede that the above studies did not explicitly account for tax evasion, they also claim that the studies did not altogether ignore tax evasion under the FairTax. These studies presumably incorporated some degree of tax evasion in their calculations by using National Income and Product Account based figures, which is argued to understate total household consumption. The studies also did not account for capital gains that may be realized by the U.S. government if consumer prices were allowed to rise, which would reduce the real value of nominal U.S. government debt. [...] Nor <b>did</b> <b>these</b> studies account for any increased economic growth that many economists researching the plan believe would occur.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song were criticized with BBC's Nick Reynolds saying that {{although}} the group [...] "reinvent themselves as domestic goddesses for some lucky man", the song was neither convincing nor good. He further opined [...] "I thought {{they were supposed to}} be independent women?!" [...] juxtaposing it with the group's earlier song [...] "Independent Women" [...] (2000). Jenny Eliscu of Rolling Stone echoed his statements, writing [...] "Jerkins should hang his head in shame for having a hand in the maudlin 'Cater 2 U,' a saccharine tune about how low Knowles, Rowland and Williams will stoop to prove their devotion to their man... Since when <b>did</b> <b>these</b> independent women become so craven?". Sean Fennessey of Pitchfork Media also stated that [...] "their swan song of sorts... completely defies the winking empowerment most of their greatest jams provided". He further described the production as [...] "milky and slight", the chorus as [...] "limp" [...] and the song overally as [...] "a Prince mock-up of the worst kind". Jess Harvell of the same website offered similar criticism: [...] " [...] reneged on everything early DC stood for in a parade of kept-wifey pleas". Alex MacPherson of Stylus Magazine dismissed the sincerity of the lyrics classifying [...] "Cater 2 U" [...] as a [...] "queasy" [...] song. Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph panned it as [...] "cringe inducing, with lots of sensuous moaning". Barbara Ellen of The Observer wrote, [...] "I thought this was the kind of song bands recorded by mistake then hid guiltily in the attic".|$|E

500|$|When {{designing}} {{the game from}} an artistic viewpoint, the team took various pieces of work as inspiration. Robert Polidori's photographs of Lower Ninth Ward following Hurricane Katrina were used as a reference point when {{designing the}} flooded areas of Pittsburgh. [...] " [...] <b>did</b> <b>these</b> amazingly beautiful, horrific photos... it's not just decay and rot and post-apocalyptic grey, it's a human world that we're playing with when we portray this destruction," [...] said Straley. The concept of post-apocalyptic environments was considered a [...] "starting point" [...] for the artists. The art team also strived to achieve realism within every piece of art. Straley explained that the artists [...] "would be like, I'm {{going to make this}} the most awesome fucking wall ever," [...] in terms of creating attractive environments. The art department were forced to fight for things that they wished to include, due to the high demand during development. Ultimately, the team settled on a balance between simplicity and detail; while Straley and Druckmann preferred the former, the art team preferred the latter. The artistic composition of the game's locations was also a feature strongly focused on, in order to evoke varying emotions from players. In the final weeks of development, roles from the art department were undertaken by other members of the team; for example, Straley hand-arranged the texts on the game's training screens, a task that lead artist Nate Wells found unusual. [...] "I have never even heard of a game director doing that! That's like... an intern task," [...] Wells said.|$|E
500|$|Robson {{appeared}} on The Today Show on May 16, 2013, {{to discuss the}} allegations. Robson told interviewer Matt Lauer that Jackson was [...] "a pedophile and a child sexual abuser" [...] who [...] "performed sexual acts on me and forced me to perform sexual acts on him" [...] over a seven-year period, beginning in 1990 when Robson {{was seven years old}} when he visited Jackson's Neverland Ranch for the first time. In a 1993 deposition Robson's mother, Joy Robson, said that Jackson had [...] "special friends", boys with whom he spent extra time with that he replaced each year, and that Wade was Jackson's [...] "special friend" [...] in 1990. In August 1993, after the allegations against Jackson were made public, Wade Robson and Jackson's other [...] "special friend", Brett Barnes, held a press conference in which they stated that they had slept in Jackson's bed but nothing sexual had occurred. Robson said in the Today Show interview that his denial of wrongdoing on Jackson's part during the 1993 investigation was a result of Jackson's [...] "complete manipulation and brainwashing" [...] of him. Robson alleged that at the time Jackson [...] "would call me every day and role play and tell me the same sort of things and also tell me then that if anyone ever thought that we <b>did</b> <b>these</b> things, any of these sexual things, that both of us would go to jail {{for the rest of our}} lives." [...] Robson was also a star witness for Jackson's defense at his 2005 trial. He said that his change of story was provoked by becoming a father and experiencing nervous breakdowns in 2011 and 2012.|$|E
