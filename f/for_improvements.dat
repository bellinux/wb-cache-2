5|$|Frequency scaling was the {{dominant}} reason <b>for</b> <b>improvements</b> in computer performance from the mid-1980s until 2004. The runtime {{of a program}} {{is equal to the}} number of instructions multiplied by the average time per instruction. Maintaining everything else constant, increasing the clock frequency decreases the average time it takes to execute an instruction. An increase in frequency thus decreases runtime for all compute-bound programs.|$|E

40|$|From Wall Street to Washington, from boardrooms to union halls, -what {{anybody with}} power is most scared of is change. Any kind of change. " Lee lacocca, Former President, Ford Motor Corp. and Chrysler Corp. (Quoted in O'Toole, 1995) The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to develop a scale to measure middle management support <b>for</b> organisational <b>improvement.</b> Middle management support <b>for</b> <b>improvement</b> is critical to the achievement of high performance, and can therefore be described as an enabler of high performance. The EFQM Excellence Model, the primary organisational excellence award in Europe, also describes enablers of high performance, but it does not include middle management support <b>for</b> <b>improvement.</b> Although the literature includes many articles on the importance of middle management support <b>for</b> <b>improvement,</b> {{there is a lack of}} information on methods for measuring it. Research is undertaken to identify the primary attributes of middle management support <b>for</b> <b>improvement.</b> The resulting questionnaire is used to collect data on middle management support <b>for</b> <b>improvement</b> in four organisations in the US and the UK. The reliability of the questionnaire is evaluated, and the questionnaire is revised based upon the findings. The revised questionnaire is shown to have strong validity and reliability. The relationship between organisational performance and middle management support <b>for</b> organisational <b>improvement</b> is discussed. A shortened version of the EFQM Excellence Model self-assessment is developed. Data are collected using this questionnaire at the four participating organisations. The results of the EFQM and middle management support questionnaires are compared. There appears to be a correlation between middle management support <b>for</b> <b>improvement</b> and the EFQM enablers, but more research is needed in this area. The primary contribution {{of this research is}} the development of a reliable and valid scale to measure middle management support <b>for</b> <b>improvement.</b> Recommendations are provided for further research opportunities...|$|R

5|$|At {{their first}} series of {{meetings}} on 14 September, the Night Defence Committee began collecting a series of suggestions <b>for</b> <b>improvements,</b> which were discussed in depth on 1 October. These were passed on to Dowding for implementation, but he found that many of their suggestions were already out of date. For instance, they suggested building new radars {{that could be used}} over land, allowing the fight to continue throughout the raid. A contract for this type of radar had already been sent out in June or July. They suggested that the filter room at RAF Bentley Priory be devolved down to the Group headquarters to improve the flow of information, but Dowding had already gone a step further and devolved night interception to the Sector level at the airfields. Dowding accepted only four of the suggestions.|$|E
5|$|In 1800 {{the civil}} {{engineers}} William Jessop and John Rennie assisted local engineers with plans <b>for</b> <b>improvements,</b> {{the chief of}} which was for a steam pumping station. This plan was not implemented immediately, but two steam engines fitted with scoop wheels were installed at Pode Hole in 1823. The pumping station was {{the largest in the}} Fens at the time, and remained so for many years. Steam gradually gave way to diesel engines and scoop wheels were replaced by centrifugal pumps, and the diesel engines were then replaced by electric motors. However, the beam engine and scoop wheel at Pinchbeck Marsh, which ran from 1833 to 1952, was not scrapped, and can be visited by the public.|$|E

Redesign of the smaller gold pieces, Lincoln cent, and Buffalo nickel followed between 1908 and 1913. By then, the dime, quarter, and half dollar were the only coins being struck which had not received a redesign in the 20th century. As the 1916 date approached when the Barber coins could be changed without an act of Congress, calls for a new design increased.|$|E

The new building was designed by KKE Architects with significant input from a citizen advisory committee. Ebert, Inc. was hired as the general contractor. The old building's last day of operation was September 12, 2009, at which time it was reported in the Longfellow/Nokomis Messenger that the renovated library was expected to reopen sometime in the fall of the next year. During the construction, patrons were encouraged to make use of nearby libraries including East Lake, Roosevelt, Washburn, and Southdale.|$|E
5|$|In February 1953, Lympne was {{waterlogged}} {{and services}} were temporarily transferred to Southend. In September waterlogging again stopped the air ferry, which {{was transferred to}} RAF West Malling. Six Bristol Freighter Mk.32s were introduced in March 1953, {{at a cost of}} £540,000, which could each carry three cars and a service to Ostend was started with the aircraft. Skyways remained at Lympne until October 1954 when it moved to Lydd (Ferryfield). On 3 October 1954, the last Silver City flight to Le Touquet was operated by Bristol Freighter G-AIFV. Silver City moved to Lydd because the runway at Lympne was not suitable. Although it had campaigned <b>for</b> <b>improvements</b> to the runway and was Lympne's biggest customer the airfields owners, the Ministry of Civil Aviation, refused. Silver City said it would build an airport suitable for its needs at Lydd.|$|E

5|$|On October 28, 2014, Alta Bicycle Share and NYCDOT {{announced}} {{a plan to}} improve and expand the Citi Bike program. Bikeshare Holdings LLC, a new entity formed by the partners at real estate developer Related Companies and gym chain Equinox Fitness, acquired Alta Bicycle Share—renamed Motivate—and named Jay Walder as the new chief executive. The increase of funding includes $5 million from Bikeshare Holdings; $70.5 million from a 10-year extension of the Citigroup sponsorship; and $15 million from the Goldman Sachs Urban Investment Group. As part of the restructuring deal, Walder moved the company headquarters from Portland, Oregon, to New York City.

At the beginning of the project, the area, once dominated by commercial fishing, had been falling into disarray as its practical future became uncertain. The dynamics of the project changed throughout its course; in early 2011, the city approved spending for specific updates to infrastructure along the corridor, including improved lighting and signs, a more extensive sidewalk system, and versatility with regard to bicycle and pedestrian traffic.

5|$|The River Don Navigation was {{the result}} of early efforts to make the River Don in South Yorkshire, England, navigable between Fishlake and Sheffield. The Dutch {{engineer}} Cornelius Vermuyden had re-routed the mouth of the river in 1626, to improve drainage, and the new works included provision for navigation, but the scheme did not solve the problem of flooding, and the Dutch River was cut in 1635 to link the new channel to Goole. The first Act of Parliament to improve navigation on the river was obtained in 1726, by a group of Cutlers based in Sheffield; the Corporation of Doncaster obtained an Act in the following year <b>for</b> <b>improvements</b> to the lower river. Locks and lock cuts were built, and, by 1751, the river was navigable to Tinsley.|$|E
