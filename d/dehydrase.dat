40|$|AbstractBackground: Escherichia coli β-hydroxydecanoyl thiol ester <b>dehydrase</b> (<b>dehydrase)</b> is {{essential}} to the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, by shunting a 10 -carbon intermediate from the saturated fatty acid pathway into the unsaturated fatty acid pathway. <b>Dehydrase</b> catalyzes reactions of dehydration and of double-bond isomerization on 10 -carbon thiol esters of acyl carrier protein (ACP). The aim of this work is to elucidate mechanisms for the two enzymatic reactions, which occur in an unusual bifunctional active site, and to understand the specificity of the enzyme for substrates with 10 -carbon fatty acyl chains. Results Crystal structures at 2. 0 å resolution for free <b>dehydrase</b> and for the enzyme modified by its classic, mechanism-based inactivator, 3 -decynoyl-N-acetylcysteamine, have been determined. <b>Dehydrase</b> is a symmetric dimer with an unusual α+β ‘hot dog’ fold. Each of the two independent active sites is located between the two subunits of the enzyme, and is a tunnel-shaped pocket completely isolated from the general solvent. Side chains of histidine from one subunit and aspartic acid from the other are the only potentially reactive protein groups in the active site. Conclusion A two-base mechanism by which the histidine and aspartic acid together catalyze dehydration and isomerization reactions is consistent with the active-site structure. The unique topology of the protein fold and the identification of the active-site components reveal features of predictive value for another enzyme, FabZ, which may be the non-specific dehydratase involved in elongation of fatty acyl chains. A positively charged area surrounding the entrance to the active site, which could interact with the negatively charged ACP, was also found...|$|E

The isolated <b>dehydrase</b> was purified over 3000 -fold and showed optimal enzymic activity toward beta-hydroxyacyl-CoAs or trans- 2 -enoyl-CoAs with carbon chain lengths of 8 - 10. The purified preparation (VDH) displayed a pH optimum at 7. 5 with beta-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA, and at 6. 0 with beta-hydroxystearoyl-CoA. Competitive-inhibition studies suggested that VDH contained <b>dehydrase</b> isoforms, and SDS/PAGE showed three major bands at 47, 71 and 78 kDa, all of which reacted to antibody raised to the purified preparation. Immunocytochemical studies with anti-rabbit IgG to VDH unequivocally demonstrated gold particles randomly distributed throughout the peroxisomal matrix of liver sections from both untreated and di-(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate-treated rats. No labelling was associated with endoplasmic reticulum or with the microsomal fraction. Substrate-specificity studies and the use of antibodies to VDH and to the peroxisomal trifunctional protein indicated that VDH and the latter are separate enzymes.

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of δ-aminolevulinic acid {{and activities of}} δ-aminolevulinic acid <b>dehydrase</b> were examined in the marine diatom, Skeletonema costatum, grown {{in the presence of}} levulinic acid.

The recovery is characterized by increased cellular cholorphyll content, decreased δ-aminolevulinic acid accumulation, decreased 3 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea-enhanced in vivo fluorescence, and the induction of a levulinic acid-activated δ-aminolevulinic acid <b>dehydrase</b> which does not follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The data indicate that levulinic acid blocks may be ineffective in vivo, and that δ-aminolevulinic acid is metabolized to amino and dicarboxylic acids. δ-Aminolevulinic acid <b>dehydrase</b> activities are used to estimate the capacity for chlorophyll synthesis.
