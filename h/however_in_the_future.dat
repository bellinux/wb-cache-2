As with before, however, trains are occasional and reserved for specialty loads, such as oversized loads and hazardous materials, which will be banned from the tunnel. It was also stated that the trains, which will be able to go up to 30mph on the newly renovated line versus the old limit of 5mph, will be able to cross Biscayne Boulevard in 90 seconds.
