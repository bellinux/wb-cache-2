40|$|ABSTRACT The {{research}} was conducted {{based on the same}} authority which is owned by the two institutions, namely <b>Food</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drug</b> <b>Administration</b> of the Republic of Indonesia and Bali Provicial Government in monitoring and controlling of alcoholic beverages in Bali. The results of this study demonstrate the <b>Food</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drug</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>and</b> the Provincial Government of Bali have the same authority to supervise and control alcoholic beverages in Bali. Bali Local Government Regulation Number 5 of 2012 on the Circulation of Alcoholic Beverage Control only requires each has a label on alcoholic beverages issued by the Government of Bali has to be distributed to the public, while the authority of the <b>Food</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drug</b> <b>Administration</b> is regulated in the Regulation of Minister of Health of the Republic of Indonesia Number 382 /MENKES/PER/VI/ 1989 on Registration of Food that requires all food produced both by local producers <b>and</b> imported <b>foods</b> are required to be registered to the Ministry of Health through the <b>Food</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drug</b> <b>Administration.</b> In the Regulation Number 5 Year 2012 did not include the authority of the <b>Food</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drug</b> <b>Administration</b> (the Empty Norms) so that the <b>Food</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drug</b> <b>Administration</b> can not perform optimally the law enforcement against manufacturers, distributors and sellers of alcoholic beverages in violation. To cope with the condition it should be a amendment in the Bali Provincial Regulation Number 5 of 2012 by stating firmly and clearly the authority of the <b>Food</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drug</b> <b>Administration</b> related to the registration of food, which requires that for all <b>foods</b> <b>and</b> beverages that will be distributed to the public must be registered to the Ministry of Health through the <b>Food</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drug</b> <b>Administration...</b>|$|R
25|$|No single {{agency is}} {{responsible}} for all food safety regulations and enforcement in China, and the departments' duties often overlap. There are also local and regional food safety agencies, {{but there is no}} clear hierarchy of agencies at the local or national levels. In response to complexity of numerous agencies monitoring and regulating food safety, the National People's Congress established the State Food and Drug Administration in 2003. The State Food and Drug Administration was supposed to oversee the all aspects of food safety regulations and unify food safety controls. However, the State <b>Food</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drug</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> not become the main governing department as the government had intended, and the other national agencies have continued to regulate and monitor food safety. This unclear division of duties has created conflict and confusion when citizens have sought to complain or when a major crisis needed to be resolved.|$|E
