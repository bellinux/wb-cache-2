40|$|This {{paper will}} {{describe}} {{the design of}} a temporary <b>emergency</b> <b>floating</b> footbridge, to be made when the infrastructure is destroyed by a flood, hurricane, tsunami or any other disaster. The bridge is made of identical floating modules. The modules are composed of prefabricated elements: two trusses, a pontoon and the footpath. The height of the trusses is integrated with the handrail. The sides of the pontoons are inclined to stack these elements during transport. The modules are assembled at the site. A completed module is fastened to the other modules of the bridge. The completed bridge is floated into position. Thanks to the combination of trusses and pontoons, the deformations under expected loadings are reduced considerately. Structurally the pontoons can be considered as flexible supports for the trussed bridge, spanning between the river banks...|$|R
50|$|Later {{modifications}} {{included the}} ability to carry the Nord SS.11 wire-guided missile, with the fitting of the Aimers sight in the left cockpit roof and the installation of large inflatable <b>emergency</b> <b>floats</b> in sponsons {{on either side of}} the cabin to prevent capsizing of the top-heavy aircraft in the event of ditching. The SS.11 had limited range to target small surface targets such as patrol boats or shore positions and this was later replaced by the AS.12, which effectively had double the range.|$|E
5000|$|Avraham Shifrin, a self-declared KGB expert, claimed that, {{according}} to the investigation of his research centre, KAL 007 landed on water north of Moneron, and the passengers successfully disembarked on <b>emergency</b> <b>floats.</b> The Soviets collected them and subsequently sent them to camps (with the children [...] "separated from their parents and safely hidden in the orphan houses {{of one of the}} Soviet Middle Asian republics"). McDonald in particular was supposed to have gone through a number of prisons in Moscow, among them the Central Lubyanka, and Lefortovo.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} the {{accident}} was {{the failure of the}} power flying control system. Plasma coating on the pistons of the power flying control system had flaked off and blocked the return valve, causing the aircraft to lose its maneuverability. It was revealed in 2007 that the failed component was inside a system that Copterline did not have the authority to service or even open. A periodic leak test that could have revealed the problem was omitted. Furthermore, the <b>emergency</b> <b>floats</b> failed to operate. The manufacturer, Sikorsky, confirmed that damages have been paid {{to the families of the}} casualties, but a court case between Copterline and Sikorsky is still pending.|$|E
50|$|Most pontoon bridges are temporary, used {{in wartime}} and civil <b>emergencies.</b> Permanent <b>floating</b> bridges {{are useful for}} {{sheltered}} water-crossings where it is not considered economically feasible to suspend a bridge from anchored piers. Such bridges can require a section that is elevated, or can be raised or removed, to allow waterborne traffic to pass.|$|R
50|$|The FAA {{does not}} require {{commercial}} pilots to train to ditch but airline cabin personnel must train on the evacuation process.

The outrigger was a mere switch, alternately rising in air, and then depressed in the water.|$|R

50|$|Typical cabin {{arrangements}} {{allows for}} eight passengers {{in a club}} seating configuration, or nine passengers in a high density seating configuration, passenger seating is designed for quick rearrangement based upon current demands. The cabin can be accessed either through sliding doors in {{either side of the}} aircraft or via large clamshell doors {{at the rear of the}} cabin; in combination with the high mounted tail boom, the clamshell doors are designed to provide safe clearance for loading and unloading activities even while the rotors are turning. In an EMS/casualty evacuation arrangement, the EC145 can carry up to two stretchered patients with three accompanying medical staff. The helicopter can be fitted with <b>emergency</b> <b>floats,</b> rescue hoist, search light, load hook and specialist equipment for other operational requirements.|$|E
5000|$|Avraham Shifrin {{claimed that}} {{according}} to the investigation of his Research Centre for Prisons, Psychprisons and Forced Labor Concentration Camps of the USSR, KAL 007 landed on water north of Moneron Island, and the passengers successfully disembarked on <b>emergency</b> <b>floats.</b> The Soviets collected them and subsequently sent them to camps with the children [...] "separated from their parents and safely hidden in the orphan houses {{of one of the}} Soviet Middle Asian republics". According to Michel Brun this theory is not entirely preposterous. In his book he analyses the first news, communicated by CIA and South Korean government: that KAL 007 landed in Sakalin and all passengers are safe. In his careful searches, he discovered the source of this first information. It was published in a Japanese newspaper: Mainichi Shinboun September 1, 1983. According to him, this observation came from Wakkanai radars. So, he considers that another aircraft, probably military, landed at Sakhalin during the [...] "Sakhalin battle" [...] and that its passengers, American and/or South Korean, were jailed in the Soviet Union.|$|E
40|$|Background: Although current {{guidelines}} {{recommend that}} primary percutaneous intervention (PCI) {{should be performed}} for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), accessibility to this important health care service for severe heart <b>emergency</b> among <b>floating</b> population in Guangzhou remains largely unstudied and poorly understood. This retrospective study explored the variations in the odds of receiving primary PCI for STEMI patients among floating population and residential population in Guangzhou. Methods: Study {{data were collected from}} the First Peopleâ€™s Municipal Hospital of Guangzhou to conduct a cross-sectional study of 1, 216 patients with STEMI (code 410 of ICD- 9) for the period from 2009 to 2014. Data in this study, including demographic and clinical characteristics, invasive treatment and pre-hospital delay time, was retrieved from electronic medical record system developed in 2005 and maintain a comprehensive electronic record of all patients of hospital. Chi-square test was performed to evaluate the differences in demographic characteristics and coexisting condition among STEMI patients between floating population and residential population. Differences in receipt primary PCI, pre-hospital delay time and door-toballoon time between two population groups were evaluated by a binary logistic regression model. To evaluate the performance odds, I adjusted for age, gender, and coexisting conditions. Data of the study was analysed using the SPSS 21 package software. Result: Compare to residential population, STEMI patients in floating population were less likely to receive primary PCI (20. 5 % vs 26. 3 %, P= 0. 049). On adjusting for sex, age and coexisting conditions, the odds of receipt primary PCI for STEMI patients in floating population was lower than residential population (floating population, OR= 0. 63, 95 % CI= 0. 45 - 0. 88; residential population, OR= 1. 0). More pre-hospital delays of STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI were found in floating population, the odds of delay time > 6 hours was higher than residential population (OR= 4. 27, 95 % CI= 1. 49 - 12. 24). There was no statistical difference in door-to-balloon time > 90 minutes between two population groups (OR= 1. 61, 95 % CI= 0. 60 - 4. 32). Conclusion: Patients with STEMI in Guangzhou floating population were less likely to receive primary PCI. Policy interventions including government subsidy on severe disease in population, pilot medical insurance schemes, and transferability of insurance payment cross provinces are needed to increase the accessibility to emergency severe health care for STEMI patients in floating population. Additionally, an educational program on early symptoms and rapid response of STEMI should be established to increase the awareness at national level, especially in floating population. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|R
