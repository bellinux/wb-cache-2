5|$|In 1769, Day and his {{barrister}} friend, John Bicknell, chose Sabrina {{and another}} girl, Lucretia, from orphanages, and falsely declared {{they would be}} indentured to Day's friend Richard Lovell Edgeworth. Day took the girls to France to begin Rousseau's methods of education in isolation. After a short time, he returned to Lichfield with only Sabrina, having deemed Lucretia inappropriate for his experiment. He used unusual, eccentric, and sometimes cruel, techniques to try to increase her fortitude, such as firing blanks at <b>her</b> <b>skirts,</b> dripping hot wax on her arms, and having her wade into a lake fully dressed to test her resilience to cold water.|$|E
5|$|Formerly, men {{not wearing}} {{military}} uniform wore knee breeches of an 18th-century design. Women's evening dress included trains and tiaras or feathers {{in their hair}} (or both). The dress code governing formal court uniform and dress has progressively relaxed. After World WarI, when Queen Mary wished to follow fashion by raising <b>her</b> <b>skirts</b> {{a few inches from}} the ground, she requested a lady-in-waiting to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the king's reaction. King GeorgeV was horrified, so the queen kept her hemline unfashionably low. Following their accession in 1936, King GeorgeVI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, allowed the hemline of daytime skirts to rise. Today, there is no official dress code. Most men invited to Buckingham Palace in the daytime choose to wear service uniform or lounge suits; a minority wear morning coats, and in the evening, depending on the formality of the occasion, black tie or white tie.|$|E
25|$|The Tour de France has {{the major}} fault of {{dividing}} the country, {{right down to}} the smallest hamlet, even families, into two rival camps. I know a man who grabbed his wife and held her on the grill of a heated stove, seated and with <b>her</b> <b>skirts</b> held up, for favouring Jacques Anquetil when he preferred Raymond Poulidor. The following year, the woman became a Poulidor-iste. But it was too late. The husband had switched his allegiance to Gimondi. The last I heard they were digging in their heels and the neighbours were complaining.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, however, Aloysius is in {{love with}} Clarissa Whortle, the {{daughter}} of a judge. Sir Trevor has led everyone to believe {{that he is going to}} marry Clarissa to assist Aloysius in evading Clarissa's father. Aloysius, on the other hand, has allowed everyone to believe that he will marry Jane. Before going to the Registrar to be married, Aloysius decides that Clarissa's clothing is too fashionable, so Clarissa borrows Jane's nurse attire. Rosebud appears and the mortals criticise her because <b>her</b> <b>skirts</b> are too short. No one wants her assistance, but she explains (mistaking Clarissa for Jane because of the change of clothing) that a demon is planning to carry off the lady. She vanishes, and everyone is angry with her, thinking her rude. Now Demon Alcohol meets Sir Trevor, who has been left alone. The demon is also confused by the change of clothing; he abducts Clarissa (thinking her to be Jane) and takes her to Sir Trevor's lodgings.|$|E
25|$|Guaguancó is {{a couple}} dance of sexual {{competition}} between the male and female. The male periodically attempts to “catch” his partner with a single thrust of his pelvis. This erotic movement is called the vacunao (‘vaccination’ or more specifically ‘injection’), a gesture derived from yuka and makuta, symbolizing sexual penetration. The vacunao can also be expressed with a sudden gesture made by the hand or foot. The quinto often accents the vacunao, usually as the resolution to a phrase spanning more than one cycle of clave. Holding onto the ends of her skirt while seductively moving her upper and lower body in contrary motion, the female “opens” and “closes” her skirt in rhythmic cadence with the music. The male attempts to distract the female with fancy (often counter-metric) steps, accented by the quinto, until he is in position to “inject” her. The female reacts by quickly turning away, bringing the ends of <b>her</b> <b>skirts</b> together, or covering her groin area with her hand (botao), symbolically blocking the “injection.” Most {{of the time the}} male dancer does not succeed in “catching” his partner. The dance is performed with good-natured humor.|$|E
500|$|In her youth, Wintour {{was educated}} at the {{independent}} North London Collegiate School, where she frequently rebelled against {{the dress code}} by taking up the hemlines of <b>her</b> <b>skirts.</b> At the age of 14, she began wearing {{her hair in a}} bob. She developed an interest in fashion as a regular viewer of Cathy McGowan on Ready Steady Go!, and from the issues of Seventeen which her grandmother sent from the United States. [...] "Growing up in London in the '60s, you'd have to have had Irving Penn's sack over your head not to know something extraordinary was happening in fashion," [...] she recalled. Her father regularly consulted her when he was considering ideas for increasing readership in the youth market.|$|E

5000|$|The {{television}} program was done live. During the year it aired, an episode featured loss of <b>her</b> <b>skirt</b> on one show while singing [...] "Let Me Go, Lover!". One {{of the cast}} members tripped, and as he fell, a button on his coat caught in Stafford's costume. <b>Her</b> <b>skirt</b> falling along with the actor, Stafford tried holding onto it while singing [...] "Let me go".|$|R
500|$|Mary was not {{beheaded}} with {{a single}} strike. The first blow missed her neck and struck {{the back of her}} head. The second blow severed the neck, except for a small bit of sinew, which the executioner cut through using the axe. Afterward, he held her head aloft and declared, [...] "God save the Queen." [...] At that moment, the auburn tresses in his hand {{turned out to be a}} wig and the head fell to the ground, revealing that Mary had very short, grey hair. A small dog owned by the queen, a Skye Terrier, is said to have been hiding among <b>her</b> <b>skirts,</b> unseen by the spectators. Following the beheading, it refused to be parted from its owner's body and was covered in her blood, until it was forcibly taken away and washed. Items supposedly worn or carried by Mary at her execution are of doubtful provenance; contemporary accounts state that all her clothing, the block, and everything touched by her blood was burnt in the fireplace of the Great Hall to obstruct relic-hunters.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, cricket {{deliveries}} were bowled underarm. [...] Legend has it {{that the}} roundarm bowling action was pioneered in the early 19th century by Christina Willes, sister of John Willes, to avoid becoming ensnared in <b>her</b> <b>skirts.</b> [...] In fact, roundarm was devised by Tom Walker in the 1790s.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} quarter of the century, women mostly {{occupied}} jobs in factory work or as domestic servants, but as the war came to an end they were able to move on to such jobs as: salespeople in department stores as well as clerical, secretarial and other, what were called, [...] "lace-collar" [...] jobs. In July 1920, The New York Times ran a head line that read: [...] "the American Woman ... has lifted <b>her</b> <b>skirts</b> far beyond any modest limitation" [...] which could apply to more than just fashion; women were now rolling up their sleeves and skirts and making their way into the workforce.|$|E
60|$|A {{woman came}} to the door. One breast was bare, and hung over her blouse, which, like a dressing-jacket, fell loose over <b>her</b> <b>skirt.</b> <b>Her</b> fading, red-brown hair was all frowsy from the bed. In the folds of <b>her</b> <b>skirt</b> clung a swarthy urchin with a shockingly short shirt. He stared at us with big black eyes, the only portion of his face undecorated with egg and jam. The woman's blue eyes {{questioned}} us languidly. I told her our errand.|$|R

2500|$|Roundarm bowling {{was first}} {{developed}} about 1788 by Tom Walker of the Hambledon Club but the club ordered {{him not to}} use it in matches. In the early nineteenth century, Christiana Willes helped her brother John, who played for Kent, to practice by bowling to him. The story goes that she found underarm bowling difficult in a hooped skirt, and so in around 1807, she began bowling in a roundarm style. Developing her technique through experimentation, she naturally bowled with a higher arm due to <b>her</b> <b>skirts,</b> and found roundarm to be far more successful for her than underarm. Major rejects the [...] "hooped skirt" [...] story because, as he says, [...] "they were no longer in vogue by 1807".|$|E
2500|$|Orton and Halliwell {{felt that}} that {{sentence}} was unduly harsh [...] "because we were queers". However, prison {{would be a}} crucial formative experience for Orton; the isolation from Halliwell {{would allow him to}} break free of him creatively; and he would clearly see what he considered the corruption, priggishness, and double standards of a purportedly liberal country. As Orton put it: [...] "It affected my attitude towards society. Before I had been vaguely conscious of something rotten somewhere, prison crystallised this. The old whore society really lifted up <b>her</b> <b>skirts</b> and the stench was pretty foul.... Being in the nick brought detachment to my writing. I wasn't involved any more. And suddenly it worked." [...] The book covers that Orton and Halliwell vandalised have since become a valued part of the Islington Local History Centre collection. Some are exhibited in the Islington Museum.|$|E
