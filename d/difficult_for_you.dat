500|$|On July 30, Ambassador Satō {{wrote that}} Stalin was {{probably}} talking to Roosevelt and Churchill about {{his dealings with}} Japan, and he wrote: [...] "There is no alternative but immediate unconditional surrender {{if we are to}} prevent Russia's participation in the war." [...] On August 2, Tōgō wrote to Satō: [...] "it should not be <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to realize that... our time to proceed with arrangements of ending the war before the enemy lands on the Japanese mainland is limited, on the other hand it is difficult to decide on concrete peace conditions here at home all at once." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the time, {{the rebels}} {{had yet to}} {{completely}} surround Duchang, so Taishi Ci managed to sneak past the enemy at night and enter the fortress to meet Kong Rong. He asked Kong Rong to let him lead soldiers to fight their way out, but Kong refused and insisted on waiting for reinforcements. The rebels came closer day by day. Kong Rong wanted to seek help from Liu Bei, the Chancellor of Pingyuan State (平原國; around present-day Pingyuan, Shandong), {{but no one had}} any idea on how {{to break out of the}} siege. Taishi Ci volunteered to fight his way out and seek reinforcements from Liu Bei, but Kong Rong said, [...] "The rebels have completely surrounded the fortress. Everyone thinks it is impossible to break out. It will be very <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to break out no matter how courageous you are." [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "When I was away, you treated my mother very generously. She feels grateful, hence she told me to help you. She knew that I know what I am doing, and that I can help you. Now, everyone says it is impossible to break out. If I were to agree with them, I will not be able to repay your kindness. Why, then, did my mother send me here for? We are in a very desperate situation. I hope you won't hesitate any longer." [...] Kong Rong agreed to let him break out of the siege.|$|E

50|$|First, as a transcriptionist, {{one must}} learn the {{different}} types of goods and transcription machinery that is needed to become effective in {{what is going to be}} done.

She is a little ambitious, a little fond of pleasure, but a leader of society, and, I am sure, a very reputable member of it. To love her again would be as embarrassing to her--as it would be <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> me. <b>You,</b> my dear Lady Ruth, I am convinced, would be the last to approve of it." ...|$|R

[...] "Henderson, you, perhaps, {{have the most}} <b>difficult</b> task, <b>for</b> <b>you</b> have the servants to control. Nevertheless, I rely upon you, also. If one word of this visitor's presence here leaks out even {{so far as the}} village, out they go, every one of them. I will not have a servant in the place who does not respect my wishes. You can give any reason <b>you</b> like <b>for</b> my orders. It is a whim. I have whims, and I choose to pay <b>for</b> them. <b>You</b> are all better paid than any man breathing could pay you.

40|$|This time of {{the year}} can be <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> {{postgraduate}} students. <b>You</b> are likely to become very popular with academics as they vie for your available time to do tutorials, lectures, marking, and research <b>for</b> them.

[Footnote 175: The general {{impression}} {{produced by the}} correspondence was expressed by Spence, when he observed to Pope, [...] "People have pitied you extremely on reading your letters to Wycherley.

On another occasion he said to Spence, [...] "Wycherley was really angry with me for correcting his verses so much. I was extremely plagued, up and down, for almost two years with them. However it went off pretty well at last." [...] When Pope tampered with the written records which he cited as evidence upon the question, we can place no reliance on his passing words.] ...|$|R

2500|$|During a {{sold out}} Paris concert, {{multiple}} fans {{who were not}} able to get in to see the performance because of its 2,000 person limit began to throw stones at the venue, and were consequently tear gassed by police. It was also popular to see moshing and stage diving at their shows, but the band members discouraged this type of behavior. [...] "They hated it and they tried to stop it as much as possible," [...] artist Arturo Vega recalled, [...] "but it would happen. Kids are really resourceful. Once the lawsuits started coming in, a lot of clubs tried to ban it, too. Sometimes the security made it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> them, <b>you</b> know. Once, we were in Tijuana--and of coursem in Tiuana, who cares! They were jumping from a balcony that was at least 20 feet high. Jumping into the crowd. It was too much. It was great." ...|$|R

The mother said, 'This is nothing difficult. Why do I say that? There {{are people who}} eat dog meat, so what is strange in giving food to dogs? Do {{you know that your}} father did difficult things?' Ajatashatru asked, 'What difficult things?' The mother said,'When you were young, your finger was wounded. You could not sleep for nights because of the pain. Your father held you on his lap and sucked on your finger. Your father had a soft body, so you could sleep well. Because of the warmth of his mouth, your wound's pus broke out. Your father thought that if he spat out the pus, it would increase your pain, so he swallowed the pus.

6000|$|Dear Letitia,--The {{appearance}} of mumps {{in a small}} family of fourteen like yours, is indeed one of those dispensations which teach us how mysterious are the ways!

"If it {{were not}} that an {{adhesion}} to the popular side is necessary to your safety {{as an agent of}} our party, Tito mio," [...] said Giannozzo Pucci, who was more fraternal and less patronising in his manner than Tornabuoni, [...] "I could have wished your skill to have been employed in another way, for which it is still better fitted. But now we must look out for some other man among us who will manage to get into the confidence of our sworn enemies, the Arrabbiati; we need to know their movements more than those of the Frate's party, who are strong enough to play above-board.
