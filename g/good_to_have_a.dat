500|$|... "Commander" [...] is an electro-house-R song, set in {{a common}} time {{signature}} of 125beats per minute. It was written by Kelly Rowland, Rico Love, David Guetta and Sandy Vee with deliberate grammar errors such as [...] "there's no other who do it like I do it" [...] and [...] "you won't find no lady who does it like I does it". The lyrics have themes around hair, fashion and competing with other women. Guetta also produced the synthesized dance beats, {{which is similar to}} his other production, [...] "Sexy Bitch". The end portions of the song were compared to some of the works by hip-hop producer Timbaland. Rowland explained that the hook of the song, [...] "Commander", should be associated with dance instead of the military. [...] "When I command you to dance ... I want you moving, you know? It felt <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> song that I could express that in." ...|$|E
500|$|After meeting U2 in 1987, Steinberg {{stayed in}} touch with Bono and when the group was putting the Zoo TV Tour {{together}} in 1992, the lead singer {{thought it would be}} <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> choreographer to critique his moves on stage. Steinberg worked during the tour's pre-production to show the group how to communicate their ideas {{all the way to the}} last rows of a venue. Recognizing Bono was not a dancer, she focused on movements he could do, and sought to help him pace himself and not get lost visually in the show's enormous stage set. The group's hit [...] "Mysterious Ways" [...] had featured a belly dancer in its music video, and the group decided to incorporate one in their on-stage performance of the song. The original dancer left when the tour moved to its outdoor stadium legs. According to Steinberg, having a belly dancer on the tour originated as [...] "a bit of a joke". Steinberg began by training the dancer, and when that dancer left the tour, a replacement was needed. Bono asked Steinberg if she would like to take over and she agreed, although she had never belly danced before and by her own description did not have the voluptuous body usually associated with the form.|$|E

It was a magnificent final. We knew that they could score goals but that we could also. We needed to keep going but after 63 games it was really difficult." [...] Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard also praised West Ham, stating: [...] "West Ham were brilliant, they gave us a really good game {{but we had a}} never-say-die attitude and we stuck in there, our best chance was on penalties as we did not have any energy left." [...] Due {{to the nature of the}} comeback, the match has come to be regarded as The Gerrard Final, teammate Peter Crouch summed up the effect Gerrard had on the match: [...] "When the injury-time board went up we thought our chance had gone, but it is always <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> player like Steven Gerrard in your team."

2500|$|The book {{recommends}} monarchy as {{an ideal}} form of government, but only when the monarch is righteous. The book warns of the evil that occurs when the king is wicked, and therefore {{suggests that it is}} not generally <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> king. The book further records the decision of the people to be ruled no longer by kings, choosing instead a form of democracy led by elected judges. When citizens referred to as [...] "king-men" [...] attempted to overthrow a democratically elected government and establish an unrighteous king, the book praises a military commander who executed pro-monarchy citizens who had vowed to destroy the church of God and were unwilling to defend their country from hostile invading forces. The book also speaks favorably of a particular instance of {{what appears to be a}} peaceful Christ-centered theocracy, which lasted approximately 194 years before contentions began again.|$|E

Experiments were conducted on planar silicon samples for contact angle measurements and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for the confirmation of step wise surface modification process. Efficiency of surface amendments/modification on Si-NW FET devices was tested and monitored by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), fluorescence spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) as well as electrical measurements by front and back gating the devices in air and in aqueous solutions.

Price introduced his first post-Obamacare bill as early as 2009, thereafter reintroducing updated versions in every Congress since that point. In May 2015, as House Budget Committee chairman, Price released health care legislation which was described by Bill Kristol of the National Review as [...] "the strongest Obamacare alternative offered in Congress to date." [...] Greg Sargent of the Washington Post wrote of the bill, [...] "it's <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> fleshed out plan, because it helps clarify {{the differences between the}} parties on health reform." [...] Sargent also wrote that [...] "GOP reforms would likely translate into lower-quality plans and a coverage expansion that would benefit fewer people.

She said that Nancy has [...] "always got some kind of bitchy comeback for everyone". She explained that Nancy [...] "says that you don’t {{have to be the}} skinny blonde or the skinny brunette, you can be the one who does whatever the hell she likes". After the character had gone through certain transformations, the actress spoke about these changes saying: [...] "Nancy's gone full circle and she's had the chance to become a whole character, rather than just one who has no end of tragedy and no end of silly affairs". Fox has said that her character is [...] "a control freak. Nancy has very definite ideas of what she wants and what she doesn't". She added that Nancy is [...] "a bit posh and stiff" [...] and [...] "uptight" [...] but that she can get [...] "really wild" [...] when she has [...] "had a few drinks". Fox has described Nancy as [...] "a bit of a moral compass for the show. She knows what's right and she's often the voice of that. I think that's a really good role for her, and it's quite an important one. I think it's quite <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> strong, intelligent woman in the show".

2500|$|Rachael Blampied had auditioned 5 {{times for}} Shortland Street, with her last being {{for the role}} of Zlata Waldheim. However Blampied was turned down every time as she looked too similar to one of the core actresses, Beth Allen (who portrayed Brooke Freeman). After she auditioned {{for the role of}} Zlata, {{producers}} decided to utilise their similarities and create the role of Bree – a sister for Brooke, specifically for her. Blampied received a call in mid-2011 asking if she was eager to accept the role. She was extremely pleased with the call, saying; [...] "It's the best phone call an actor can wish for – that they're writing a part for you on a show {{you really want to be}} on. It was a complete surprise and totally out of the blue." [...] The character was originally planned to appear nicer but end up being [...] "badder" [...] than Brooke. Blampied started filming her scenes in October 2011. Blampied found her first day of work similar to walking [...] "into a beast" [...] and although she was nervous, she found it was like [...] "a family". In November TVNZ announced that a new addition would be arriving to Brooke's dysfunctional family, with Bree arriving on 9 December. Blampied enjoyed working alongside her screen sister, Allen and Pua Magasiva (who portrayed Brooke's boyfriend Vinnie), saying; [...] "I've had some great scenes with Beth and Pua, which have been enormous fun as they're such generous actors and are heaps of fun to hang out with!" [...] The character was originally envisioned to be killed off at the end of her stint, but producers were so impressed with Blampied that they rewrote the characters ending by sending her to a psychiatric hospital. Blampied was not aware as to what Bree was to endure throughout her stint but was informed that she was always going to leave after her initial storyline came to an end. She was sad to leave the soap but pleased with her exit, [...] "I was sad to have to leave the show, but it's not a closed exit. One of the writers said to me on my last day, 'Well it's always <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> crazy in the cupboard.'" [...] Bree made her last appearance on 25 September 2012.|$|E

The results show that the effects of menu design on users’ search task performance and their mouse behaviours are statistically significant. Menu design factors do affect users’ emotions, which they feel uncomfortable with bad combination of colours, smaller font size, text without code, abbreviated text, use of ambiguous term, random display and the need to scroll.
