500|$|The Court {{held that}} the report made by the prison medical officer was {{obviously}} a decision but that alone did not make him a [...] "decision-maker" [...] in the sense explained by Lord Diplock. This was because the officer's report that the appellant was fit for caning did not have legal effect– the District Court judge was duty bound to impose the sentence of caning irrespective of what the officer might <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> his report. Hence, {{it was not a}} case for judicial review at all. The Court also said that another example of non-decision-making conduct was a police officer arresting a person suspected of committing an offence.|$|E

500|$|Many of {{the themes}} and musical styles of the album were {{inspired}} by Beyoncé's role in Dreamgirls. The plot of the film revolves around The Dreams, a fictional 1960s group of three female singers who attempt success in the mainstream music industry {{with the help of}} their manager, Curtis Taylor. Beyoncé portrays Deena Jones, the lead singer of the group and the wife of Taylor, and is emotionally abused by him. Because of her role, Beyoncé was inspired to produce an album with an overriding theme of feminism and female empowerment. In the bonus track, [...] "Encore for the Fans", Beyoncé says, [...] "Because I was so inspired by Deena, I wrote songs that were saying all the things I wish she would <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> the film." ...|$|E

500|$|Takumi only spent {{little time}} on writing a backstory for Phoenix before writing the game's story, and instead made up {{dialogue}} and developed Phoenix's personality {{as he went}} along. Takumi said that Phoenix is Shu Takumi in everything but name, with dialogue similar to what Takumi would <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> each situation in the games; he attributed this to him being a first-time writer who did not think about developing characterization prior to writing the story. Takumi didn't write a backstory for Dick Gumshoe; instead, Gumshoe's character and personality just [...] "fell into place" [...] after Takumi decided that the character would end his sentences with [...] "pal". Other aspects of the character came about organically as Takumi wrote the story; for instance, at one point Edgeworth says that he will cut Gumshoe's salary, which became part of Gumshoe's backstory. Takumi {{came up with the}} partner character Maya because {{he thought it would be}} more fun for players to have another character with them, giving them advice, than investigating on their own. Originally, she was going to be a lawyer-in-training, preparing to take the bar exam.|$|E

[...] Tony Shaw was quoted in 2011 to have said [...] "he just cannot play the game naturally and it won't work. Just say to him, 'Take your money, you've been fantastic for us', maybe see the year out, but I wouldn't be playing him very often any more." [...] Paul Roos is quoted to have said that [...] "a player of Karmichael Hunt's current ability would probably be worth only $100,000 in the AFL". [...] Jason Akermanis is quoted to <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> reference to both Hunt and Israel Folau – who converted from rugby league to Australian rules football the year after Hunt – that [...] "if they can't run and they can't handball - and we're only talking basics like kick, run, chase, handball and get body-to-body collisions - and can't get up to speed its going to be such {{a waste of time and}} money." ...|$|E

Other associates sympathetic to the U.S. were Trinidad Pardo de Tavera and Benito Legarda, prominent members of Congress; Gregorio Araneta, Aguinaldo's Secretary of Justice; and Felipe Buencamino, Aguinaldo's Secretary of Foreign Affairs. Buencamino is recorded to <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> 1902: [...] "I am an American and all the money in the Philippines, the air, the light, and the sun I consider American."
