25|$|From the {{beginning}} of the planning for what became The Owen School, the goal was to create a graduate business school of “the highest professional quality” with a two-year program leading to an MBA. Most students in the early years were young men from Tennessee and surrounding states, fulfilling the hopes of businessmen to keep talented people in the area, but by 2008, men and women from across the United States and from international locales had attended The Owen School. At present about 25 percent are international students, and 33 percent are women. Recruiters from American and international companies have sought out the students, and the school has expanded its offerings to specialized master's degrees (in health care, finance, and accountancy), an Executive MBA program, and an <b>Executive</b> <b>Development</b> program.|$|E

40|$|In {{a series}} of studies, {{repetitive}} behaviour, <b>executive</b> function <b>development</b> and the links between these constructs were explored in Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS). An overview of these constructs provided evidence that executive dysfunction might underpin repetitive behaviour and justified {{the use of a}} developmental trajectory approach. Repetitive behaviour was explored in RTS in relation to Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Down and Fragile-X syndromes. Body stereotypy and repetitive questioning occurred at a similar frequency in RTS and ASD, but repetitive phrases occurred less frequently in RTS. A test battery was compiled and administered to profile the developmental trajectories of executive functions in RTS relative to typically developing children. <b>Executive</b> function <b>development</b> was delayed in RTS relative to mental age. Finally, the relationships between <b>executive</b> function <b>development</b> and repetitive behaviour were explored in RTS using correlational analyses. Repetitive questioning was related to poorer scores on verbal working memory and inhibition measures. Adherence to routines was related to poorer scores on a measure of shifting and emotional regulation, and completing behaviour was related to poorer scores on shifting measures. These findings highlight the merit of studying <b>executive</b> function <b>development</b> in disorder groups and that pathways can be mapped between cognition and behaviour. The implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed...|$|R

5000|$|In {{contrast}} to other corporate training & development activities, which have as their core purpose to build tactical skills for employees, <b>executive</b> <b>development</b> plays a different {{role for the}} organization.

In the best of cases, <b>executive</b> <b>development</b> not only helps an organization execute its key strategies, it can also help provide input to the strategy creation process. In this way, <b>executive</b> <b>development</b> is much more strategic than typical corporate training & development which is used for most employees of an organization.|$|E
