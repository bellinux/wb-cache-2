5|$|Scandium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Sc and atomic number 21. A silvery-white metallic d-block element, it {{has historically been}} classified as a rare earth element, together with yttrium and the lanthanides. It was discovered in 1879 by spectral analysis of the minerals <b>euxenite</b> and gadolinite from Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|Scandium is {{distributed}} sparsely and occurs in trace amounts in many minerals. Rare minerals from Scandinavia and Madagascar such as gadolinite, <b>euxenite,</b> and thortveitite {{are the only}} known concentrated sources of this element, the latter containing up to 45% of scandium {{in the form of}} scandium(III) oxide. Yttrium has the same trend in occurrence places; it is found in lunar rock samples collected during the American Apollo Project in a relatively high content as well.|$|E
5|$|In Earth's crust, {{scandium}} is not rare. Estimates {{vary from}} 18 to 25ppm, which {{is comparable to}} the abundance of cobalt (20–30ppm). Scandium is only the 50th most common element on Earth (35th most abundant in the crust), but it is the 23rd most common element in the Sun. However, scandium is distributed sparsely and occurs in trace amounts in many minerals. Rare minerals from Scandinavia and Madagascar such as thortveitite, <b>euxenite,</b> and gadolinite are the only known concentrated sources of this element. Thortveitite can contain up to 45% of scandium in the form of scandium(III) oxide.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{ytterbium}} is {{a mixture}} of seven stable isotopes, which altogether are present at concentrations of 3 parts per million. This element is mined in China, the United States, Brazil, and India in form of the minerals monazite, <b>euxenite,</b> and xenotime. The ytterbium concentration is low because it is found only among many other rare earth elements; moreover, it is among the least abundant. Once extracted and prepared, ytterbium is somewhat hazardous as an eye and skin irritant. The metal is a fire and explosion hazard.|$|E
5|$|Tantalum is {{estimated}} to make up about 1ppm or 2ppm of the Earth's crust by weight. There are many species of tantalum minerals, only {{some of which are}} so far being used by industry as raw materials: tantalite, microlite, wodginite, <b>euxenite,</b> polycrase. Tantalite (Fe, Mn)Ta2O6 is the most important mineral for tantalum extraction. Tantalite has the same mineral structure as columbite (Fe, Mn) (Ta, Nb)2O6; when there is more tantalum than niobium it is called tantalite and when there is more niobium than tantalum is it called columbite (or niobite). The high density of tantalite and other tantalum containing minerals makes the use of gravitational separation the best method. Other minerals include samarskite and fergusonite.|$|E
5|$|While {{dysprosium}} {{is never}} encountered {{as a free}} element, it is found in many minerals, including xenotime, fergusonite, gadolinite, <b>euxenite,</b> polycrase, blomstrandine, monazite and bastnäsite; often with erbium and holmium or other rare earth elements. Currently, most dysprosium is being obtained from the ion-adsorption clay ores of southern China, and future sources will include the Halls Creek region in Western Australia. In the high-yttrium version of these, dysprosium {{happens to be the}} most abundant of the heavy lanthanides, comprising up to 7–8% of the concentrate (as compared to about 65% for yttrium). The concentration of Dy in the Earth's crust is about 5.2mg/kg and in sea water 0.9ng/L.|$|E
5|$|Ytterbium {{is found}} with other rare earth {{elements}} in several rare minerals. It is most often recovered commercially from monazite sand (0.03% ytterbium). The element {{is also found in}} <b>euxenite</b> and xenotime. The main mining areas are China, the United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka, and Australia. Reserves of ytterbium are estimated as one million tonnes. Ytterbium is normally difficult to separate from other rare earths, but ion-exchange and solvent extraction techniques developed in the mid- to late 20th century have simplified separation. Compounds of ytterbium are rare and have not yet been well characterized. The abundance of ytterbium in the Earth's crust is about 3mg/kg.|$|E
5|$|The {{element is}} never {{found in nature}} in pure form, but it is found in small {{quantities}} in minerals with other rare earths. Thulium is often found with minerals containing yttrium and gadolinium. In particular, thulium occurs in the mineral gadolinite. However, thulium also occurs in the minerals monazite, xenotime, and <b>euxenite.</b> Its abundance in the Earth's crust is 0.5mg/kg by weight and 50 parts per billion by moles. Thulium makes up approximately 0.5 parts per million of soil, although this value can range from 0.4 to 0.8 parts per million. Thulium makes up 250 parts per quadrillion of seawater. In the solar system, thulium exists in concentrations of 200 parts per trillion by weight and 1part per trillion by moles. Thulium ore occurs most commonly in China. However, Australia, Brazil, Greenland, India, Tanzania, and the United States also have large reserves of thulium. Total reserves of thulium are approximately 100,000 tonnes. Thulium is the least abundant lanthanide on earth except for promethium.|$|E
25|$|Well-known {{minerals}} containing yttrium include gadolinite, xenotime, samarskite, <b>euxenite,</b> fergusonite, yttrotantalite, yttrotungstite, yttrofluorite (a {{variety of}} fluorite), thalenite, yttrialite. Small amounts occur in zircon, which derives its typical yellow fluorescence {{from some of}} the accompanying heavy lanthanides. The zirconium mineral eudialyte, such as is found in southern Greenland, contains small but potentially useful amounts of yttrium. Of the above yttrium minerals, most played a part in providing research quantities of lanthanides during the discovery days. Xenotime is occasionally recovered as a byproduct of heavy-sand processing, but is not as abundant as the similarly recovered monazite (which typically contains a few percent of yttrium). Uranium ores from Ontario have occasionally yielded yttrium as a byproduct.|$|E
500|$|Dmitri Mendeleev, who is {{referred}} to as the father of the periodic table, predicted the existence of an element ekaboron, with an atomic mass between 40 and 48 in 1869. Lars Fredrik Nilson and his team detected this element in the minerals <b>euxenite</b> and gadolinite. Nilson prepared 2grams of scandium oxide of high purity. He named the element scandium, from the Latin Scandia meaning [...] "Scandinavia". Nilson was apparently unaware of Mendeleev's prediction, but Per Teodor Cleve recognized the correspondence and notified Mendeleev.|$|E
500|$|Niobium is {{estimated}} to be the 34th most common element in the Earth’s crust, with 20ppm. Some think that the abundance on Earth is much greater, and that the element's high density has concentrated it in the Earth’s core. The free element is not found in nature, but niobium occurs in combination with other elements in minerals. Minerals that contain niobium often also contain tantalum. [...] Examples include columbite ((Fe,Mn)(Nb,Ta)2O6) and columbite–tantalite (or coltan, (Fe,Mn)(Ta,Nb)2O6). Columbite–tantalite minerals are most usually found as accessory minerals in pegmatite intrusions, and in alkaline intrusive rocks. Less common are the niobates of calcium, uranium, thorium and the rare earth elements. [...] Examples of such niobates are pyrochlore ((Na,Ca)2Nb2O6(OH,F)) and <b>euxenite</b> ((Y,Ca,Ce,U,Th)(Nb,Ta,Ti)2O6). These large deposits of niobium have been found associated with carbonatites (carbonate-silicate igneous rocks) and as a constituent of pyrochlore.|$|E
500|$|In 1869, Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev {{published}} his periodic table, which had empty spaces for elements directly above and under yttrium. Mendeleev made several predictions {{on the upper}} neighbor of yttrium, which he called eka-boron. [...] Swedish chemist Lars Fredrik Nilson and his team discovered the missing element in the minerals <b>euxenite</b> and gadolinite and prepared 2grams of scandium(III) oxide of high purity. He named it scandium, from the Latin Scandia meaning [...] "Scandinavia". Chemical experiments on the element proved that Mendeleev's suggestions were correct; along with discovery and characterization of gallium and germanium this proved the correctness of the whole periodic table and periodic law. Nilson was apparently unaware of Mendeleev's prediction, but Per Teodor Cleve recognized the correspondence and notified Mendeleev. Metallic scandium was produced {{for the first time}} in 1937 by electrolysis of a eutectic mixture, at 700–800°C, of potassium, lithium, and scandium chlorides.|$|E

50|$|From 1955 to 1960, uranium was {{extracted}} from placer black sand deposits {{derived from the}} Idaho Batholith in southwest Idaho. The deposits were mined for uranium, thorium, and rare earths.

50|$|The {{principal}} commercial {{sources of}} erbium {{are from the}} minerals xenotime and <b>euxenite,</b> and most recently, the ion adsorption clays of southern China; in consequence, China has now become the principal global supplier of this element. In the high-yttrium versions of these ore concentrates, yttrium is {{about two-thirds of the}} total by weight, and erbia is about 4-5%. When the concentrate is dissolved in acid, the erbia liberates enough erbium ion to impart a distinct and characteristic pink color to the solution. This color behavior is similar to what Mosander and the other early workers in the lanthanides would have seen in their extracts from the gadolinite minerals of Ytterby.|$|E
