40|$|Objective: To study color {{discrimination}} {{impairment in}} workers exposed to elemental mercury (Hg) vapor. Subjects:Twenty-four male workers from a chloralkali plant exposed to Hg vapor, aged 429. 8 years, {{duration of exposure}} 14. 79. 7 years, were examined. The 8 h TWA air-borne Hg concentration in workplace was 59 mg/m 3; mean Hg urinaryexcretion (HgU) was 20. 519. 3 mg/g creatinine; mean Hg urinary excretion after the administration of a chelatingagent, sodium 2, 3 -dimercapto- 1 -propane-sulfonate (DMPS), was 751. 9648 mg/ 48 h. Twenty-four age- and gendermatchedcontrol subjects were compared. Visual acuity, alcohol intake, smoking habits, and history of diseases or drugspotentially influencing color vision were registered. Methods: The Lanthony 15 -Hue desaturated test (L-D 15 -d) was usedto assess color vision. The results were expressed quantitatively as Bowman’s Color Confusion Index (CCI), andqualitatively according to Verriest’s classification of acquired <b>dyschromatopsias.</b> Results: The CCI was significantlyhigher in the exposed group than in the control (mean CCI 1. 15 versus 1. 04; P ¼ 0. 04). The proportion of subjects witherrorless performance on the Lanthony test was significantly lower in the Hg exposed group compared to referents (52 %versus 73 %; P ¼ 0. 035). The exposed group showed higher frequency of type III <b>dyschromatopsias</b> (blue–yellowconfusion axis) {{in comparison with the}} control group (12. 5 % versus 8. 3 %), however, the difference did not reachstatistical significance. Multiple regression did not show any significant relationship between the CCI, and age, alcoholconsumption, or measures of exposure. Conclusion: In agreement with previous studies by Cavalleri et al. [Toxicol. Lett. 77 (1995) 351; Environ. Res. Sec. A 77 (1998) 173], {{the results of this study}} support the hypothesis that exposure tomercury vapor can induce sub-clinical color vision impairment. This effect was observed at an exposure level below thecurrent biological limit for occupational exposure to mercury. This raises doubts on the actual protection afforded by thislimit concerning the effect of mercury on color vision...|$|R

50|$|The generalized, common {{presentation}} {{for this}} broad and inclusive group of diseases is painless, bilateral loss of visual acuity and pallor of the optic disc accompanied {{with varying degrees}} of <b>dyschromatopsia</b> and central/cecocentral scatomas. On examination the papillary response may be sluggish to light, one would not expect to find an afferent papillary defect. This is because optic neuropathies are often bilateral and symmetric. The optic disc may be mildly hyperemic with small splinter hemorrhages on or around the disc. Optic atrophy may early on be non-existent and only later become mild. In later stages the optic atrophy is severe and this indicates less opportunity for recovery.|$|E
50|$|Vision loss in toxic and {{nutritional}} optic neuropathy is bilateral, symmetric, painless, gradual, and progressive. <b>Dyschromatopsia,</b> {{a change in}} color vision, is often the first symptom. Some patients notice that certain colors, particularly red, are less bright or vivid; others have a general loss of color perception. Loss of visual acuity may start with a blur or haze {{at the point of}} fixation, followed by a progressive decline. The degree of vision loss can extend to total blindness, but a loss beyond 20/400 is rare, except in the case of methanol ingestion. Peripheral vision is usually spared since the pattern of loss typically involves a central or cecocentral scotoma, a visual field defect at or surrounding the point of fixation. This pattern can be revealed via visual field testing.|$|E
50|$|The {{extent of}} the {{symptoms}} and the damage is different from person to person. If a person has complete achromatopsia, then their entire visual field is devoid of colour. A person with <b>dyschromatopsia,</b> or incomplete achromtopsia, has similar symptoms to complete achromatopsia, but to a lesser degree. This can occur in people who had achromatopsia, but the brain recovered from the injury, restoring some colour vision. The person {{may be able to}} see certain colours. However, there are many cases where there is no recovery. Finally, a person with hemiachromatopsia see half of their field of vision in colour, and the other half in grey. The visual hemifield contralateral to a lesion in the lingual or fusiform gyrus is the one that appears grey, while the ipsilateral visual hemifield appears in colour. The variance in symptoms emphasizes the need to understand the architecture of the colour centre in order to better diagnose and possible treat cerebral achromotopsia.|$|E
50|$|A new FDA {{approved}} {{drug was}} released on the market late 2013. Jetrea (Brand name) or Ocriplasmin (Generic name) is the first drug of its kind used to treat vitreomacular adhension. Mechanism of Action: Ocriplasmin is a truncated human plasmin with proteolytic activity against protein components of the vitreous body and vitreretinal interface. It dissolves the protein matrix responsible for the vitreomacular adhesion. Adverse drug reactions: Decreased vision, potential for lens sublaxation, <b>dyschromatopsia</b> (yellow vision), eye pain, floaters, blurred vision. New Drug comparison Rating gave Jetea a 5 indicating an important advance. Previously, no recommended treatment was available for the patient with mild symptomatic VMA. In symptomatic VMA patients with more significant vision loss, the standard of care is pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), which involves surgically removing the vitreous from the eye, thereby surgically releasing the symptomatic VMA. In other words, vitrectomy induces PVD to release the traction/adhesion on the retina. An estimated 850,000 vitrectomy procedures are performed globally {{on an annual basis}} with 250,000 in the United States alone.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{multiple}} sclerosis (MS), {{even in the}} absence of a clinical episode of optic neuritis (ON), the optic nerve and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) may be damaged leading to <b>dyschromatopsia.</b> Subclinical <b>dyschromatopsia</b> has been described in MS associated with lower motor and cognitive performances. OBJECTIVES: To set the prevalence of <b>dyschromatopsia</b> in eyes of MS patients without a history of ON, to compare its prevalence in patients with and without ON history, and to explore the association between <b>dyschromatopsia</b> and disease duration, average peripapillary RNFL thickness, macular volume, and cognitive and motor performances. METHODS: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted at multiple medical centers. Data were collected after single neurological and ophthalmological evaluations. <b>Dyschromatopsia</b> was defined by the presence of at least 1 error using Hardy-Rand-Rittler plates. RESULTS: In our population of 125 patients, 79 patients (63. 2 %) never had ON and 35 (28. 8 %) had unilateral ON. The prevalence of <b>dyschromatopsia</b> in eyes of patients without ON was 25. 7 %. Patients with <b>dyschromatopsia</b> had a statistically significant lower RNFL thickness (P = 0. 004 and P = 0. 040, right and left eyes, respectively) and worse performance in symbol digit modalities test (P = 0. 012). No differences were found in macular volume or motor function tasks. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Dyschromatopsia</b> occurs frequently in MS patients. It may be associated with a worse disease status and possibly serve as a marker for the detection of subclinical disease progression since it was detected {{even in the absence}} of ON. It correlated with thinner peripapillary RNFL thickness and inferior cognitive performance. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|Optic {{neuritis}} (ON) is {{a common}} and important cause of vision loss or vision disturbances in the community, particularly amongst the young, and it {{is often associated with}} a persistent <b>dyschromatopsia.</b> Traditionally screening for <b>dyschromatopsia</b> has been carried out using pseudo-isochromatic Ishihara plates. These colour plates were originally developed for testing of colour blindness, and indeed have only more recently been applied to ON. As the Ishihara plate books used for testing are expensive, unwieldy, and are not commonly available in many clinics or wards, many neurologists and ophthalmologists have taken to using untested and unstudied downloadable software packages on portable electronic devices for testing. This study compared the efficacy of printed and iPad (Apple, Cupertino, CA, USA) versions of the Ishihara plates in screening for <b>dyschromatopsia</b> in patients who were suspected of having ON. The main finding was that <b>dyschromatopsia</b> testing using a commercially available application on an iPad was comparable to using the current pragmatic clinical benchmark, the pseudo-isochromatic plates of Ishihara.

40|$|PURPOSE: We {{sought to}} {{characterize}} the <b>dyschromatopsia</b> of optic neuritis, to determine the type and severity of color defect present {{and its relation to}} central vision and spatial acuity, to examine changes in this <b>dyschromatopsia</b> over time, and to determine the applicability of Köllner's rule to patients with optic neuritis. METHODS: We analyzed the raw data on color vision performance as assembled within the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT). The ONTT was designed to evaluate corticosteroids as a treatment for acute demyelinating optic neuritis and to allow long-term outcome and natural history analyses. Between July 1, 1988 and June 30, 1991, 488 patients were enrolled in this trial. All patients underwent extensive neurologic and ophthalmologic examinations including standardized testing of visual function that included testing of color vision. The ONTT population thus afforded a unique opportunity to characterize acquired dyschromatopsias in a large, homogenous, well-characterized cohort of patients with optic neuritis. We used quantitative analysis of FM- 100 scores from this patient cohort to determine the severity of the <b>dyschromatopsia,</b> the selectivity of the <b>dyschromatopsia</b> (polarity of errors) and the type of <b>dyschromatopsia</b> (axis of confusion) by employing quadrant analysis of FM- 100 scores. RESULTS: The results of high-and low-selectivity analyses of the FM- 100 data showed that during the acute phase of optic neuritis, blue/yellow, red/ green, and non-selective color defects occurred; among patients with pure defects, blue/yellow defects were more frequent than red/green defects. At 6 months after the acute event, however, analyses showed that red/green defects were more common than blue/yellow defects. Among patients with selective color defects both acutely and at 6 months, the defect was as likely to change over time as remain the same. The likelihood of persistent <b>dyschromatopsia</b> at 6 months was related to the severity of initial central acuity loss, but the type of <b>dyschromatopsia</b> present (red/green versus blue/yellow) was not. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest {{that at the time of}} the acute attack of optic neuritis, the majority of selective color defects were blue/yellow defects, whereas at 6 months, more of the selective defects were red/green defects, though both types of defects (as well as nonselective defects) were seen acutely and at 6 months. Despite the rigorous inclusion criteria of the ONTT, the large number of patients we studied, correlation of color vision with visual acuity, and longitudinal follow up, this study showed that no single type of color defect was consistently associated with optic neuritis. Demyelinating optic neuritis does not obey Köllner's rule. Moreover, the type of defect present changed in some patients over the course of recovery. Thus, the type of defect may not even be consistent in individual patients as they recover. The type of defect appeared to be related to spatial vision at the time of the test, but the type of defect present at 6 months was not related to the severity of the initial visual loss. Therefore, in evaluating color defects associated with optic neuritis, the level of central visual function must be considered...|$|E

MethodsA total of 50 male welders, {{who had been working}} as welders for at least 4 years, were randomly selected as case group, and 50 age matched non-welder men, who lived in the same area, were regarded as control group. Color vision was assessed using the Lanthony desatured panel D- 15 test. The test was performed under the daylight fluorescent lamp with a spectral distribution of energy with a color temperature of 6500 K and a color rendering index of 94 that provided 1000 lx on the work plane. The test was carried out monocularly and no time limit was imposed. All data analysis were performed using SPSS, version 22. ResultsThe prevalence of <b>dyschromatopsia</b> among welders was 15 % which was statistically higher than that of nonwelder group (2 %) (p= 0. 001). Among welders with <b>dyschromatopsia,</b> color vision deficiency in 72. 7 % of cases was monocular. There was positive relationship between the employment length and color vision loss (p= 0. 04).

Patients (or Materials) and Methods: Digoxin 0. 25 mg QD for atrial fibrillation was prescribed to a 91 -year-old woman with an estimated creatinine clearance of 18 mL/min. Within 2 to 3 weeks, she developed nausea, vomiting, and dysphagia, and began complaining of snowy and blurry vision, photopsia, <b>dyschromatopsia,</b> aggravated bedtime visual and proprioceptive illusions (she felt as being on a boat), and colored hallucinations. She consulted her family doctor twice and visited the eye clinic once until, 1 month after starting digoxin, impaired autonomy led her {{to be admitted to}} the emergency department. Results: Digoxin intoxication was confirmed by a high plasma level measured on admission (5. 7 μg/L; reference range, 0. 8 - 2 μg/L). After stopping digoxin, general symptoms resolved in a few days, but visual symptoms persisted. Ophtalmologic care and follow-up diagnosed digoxin intoxication superimposed on pre-existing left eye (LE) cataract, dry age-related macular degeneration (DMLA), and Charles Bonnet syndrome. Visual acuity was 0. 4 (right eye, RE) and 0. 5 (LE). Ocular fundus was physiologic except for bilateral dry DMLA. <b>Dyschromatopsia</b> was confirmed by poor results on Ishihara test (1 / 13 OU). Computerized visual field results revealed nonspecific diffuse alterations. Full-field electroretinogram (ERG) showed moderate diffuse rod and cone dysfunction. Visual symptoms progressively improved over the next 2 months, but ERG did not. Complete resolution was not expected due to the pre-existing eye disease. The patient was finally discharged home after a 5 -week hospital stay. Conclusion: Digoxin intoxication can go unrecognized by clinicians, even in a typical presentation. The range of potential visual symptoms is far greater than isolated xanthopsia (yellow vision) classically described in textbooks.

Symptoms frequently occurred in a successively building-up pattern fitting with the geo-graphical distribution of the various cortical functions. When specifically inquired, migraineurs reveal less evident symptoms that are not usually consid-ered during routine examination. Spreading depression most likely underlies the aura symptoms progression. Interictal involvement indicates that MWA and MWoA are not completely silent outside attacks, and that both subforms of migraine may share common mechanisms.

40|$|PURPOSE. Leber's {{hereditary}} {{optic neuropathy}} (LHON) is a maternally inherited disease resulting in loss of central vision and <b>dyschromatopsia,</b> caused by mitochondrial DNA point mutations. However, only {{a subset of}} the mutation carriers becomes affected, with a higher penetrance in males. This study was conducted to investigate chromatic losses in asymptomatic carriers of the LHON mutation. METHODS. Monocular chromatic discrimination was studied with the Cambridge Colour Test (CCT; Cambridge Research Systems, Ltd., Rochester, UK) along the protan, deutan, and tritan cone isolation axes in 46 LHON carriers (15 men) belonging to the same LHON maternal lineage and 74 age-matched control subjects (39 men), Inclusion criteria were absence of ophthalmic complaints and clear ocular media. A detailed neuro-ophthalmic examination was performed in all the LHON carriers. RESULTS. the differences in threshold between carriers and control subjects were significant for the three cone isolation axes at P < 0. 0001. Sixty-five percent of the carriers had abnormal protan and/or deutan thresholds; some of those with higher thresholds also had elevated tritan thresholds (13 %). the male thresholds were higher and more frequent than those of the women for the protan and deutan axes (ANOVA; P < 0. 05), but not for tritan thresholds. in the most severe losses, the women had instances of diffuse defect whereas all the men displayed a red-green defect. CONCLUSIONS. Male LHON asymptomatic carriers had color vision losses with the red-green pattern of <b>dyschromatopsia</b> typical of patients affected with LHON, which includes elevation of tritan thresholds as well. This predominantly parvocellular (red-green) impairment is compatible with the histopathology of LHON, which affects mostly the papillomacular bundle. in contrast with male losses, female losses were less frequent and severe. These gender differences are relevant to understanding LHON pathophysiology, suggesting that hormonal factors may be of great importance.
