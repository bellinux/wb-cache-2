500|$|National Book Award finalist Richard Yates told The New York Times in 1977 {{that reading}} Salinger's stories {{for the first}} time was a {{landmark}} experience, and that [...] "nothing quite like it <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> since". Yates describes Salinger as [...] "a man who used language as if it were pure energy beautifully controlled, and who {{knew exactly what he was}} doing in every silence as well as in every word." [...] Gordon Lish's O. Henry Award-winning short story [...] "For Jeromé—With Love and Kisses" [...] (1977, collected in What I Know So Far, 1984) is a play on Salinger's [...] "For Esmé—with Love and Squalor".|$|E
500|$|People assume things, {{because as}} I said, I pull from my {{personal}} experiences {{to make my}} music... I never experienced [...] firsthand, but it's something I {{wanted to talk about}} ... and it's something that <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in the past... As I said, I have a few deep, dark ones that I've kept stowed away in a closet for a minute... That's why I take this time to speak to you guys and let you know really what it is... I will tell you that I loved [...] a lot and she obviously loved me; it just didn't work out. But cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash. That ain't what broke it up.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year, Domínguez {{signed with}} the Atlanta Beat in the Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA), the top division of professional soccer in the United States at the time. She was the first Mexican-born player to sign with the league {{since its inception in}} 2001. During her first month with the team, she was named the league's Player of the Month after scoring five goals and two assists in three games. [...] She scored seven goals during the 2003 season and was a leading scorer in the league. Of her experience, she said, [...] "It's very special for me to be in the top scoring position in this league. It's the best thing that <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in my career, right up there with scoring in the 1999 Women's World Cup." [...] The Beat finished second in the standings with a 9–4–8 record.|$|E

500|$|By the {{following}} year, {{the case against}} Andrić was dropped {{due to lack of}} evidence, and he was released from prison on 20 March 1915. The authorities exiled him to the village of Ovčarevo, near Travnik. He arrived there on 22 March and was placed under the supervision of local Franciscan monks. Andrić soon befriended the friar Alojzije Perčinlić and began researching the history of Bosnia's Catholic and Orthodox Christian communities under Ottoman rule. Andrić lived in the parish headquarters, and the Franciscans gave him access to the monastery chronicles. In return, he assisted the parish priest and taught religious songs to pupils at the monastery school. Andrić's mother soon came to see her son, and offered to serve as a housekeeper for the parish priest. [...] "Mother is very happy," [...] Andrić wrote. [...] "It has been three whole years since she saw me. And she can't grasp all that <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in that time, nor the whole of my crazy, cursed existence. She cries, kisses me and laughs in turn. Like a mother." ...|$|E
500|$|I saw the boy getting {{injured in}} his leg, {{and the father}} asking for help. Then I saw him getting injured in his arm, the father. The father was asking the {{ambulances}} to help him, because {{he could see the}} ambulances. I cannot see the ambulance... I wasn't far away, maybe from them [...] face to face about 15 meters, 17 meters. But the father didn't succeed to get the ambulance by waving to them. He looked at me and he said, [...] "Help me." [...] I said, [...] "I cannot, I can't help you." [...] The shooting till then was really heavy... It was really raining bullets, for more than for 45minutes. Then... I hear something, [...] "boom!" [...] Really is coming with a lot of dust. I looked at the boy, I filmed the boy lying down in the father's lap, and the father really, getting really injured, and he was really dizzy. I said, [...] "Oh my god, the boy's got killed, the boy's got killed," [...] I was screaming, I was losing my mind. While I was filming, the boy got killed... I was very afraid, I was very upset, I was crying, and I was remembering my children.... This was the most terrible thing that <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as a journalist.|$|E
2500|$|In another incident, Cao Cao's saddle was chewed by rodents when it {{was kept}} in a store. The storekeepers feared for their lives because the laws were very harsh during those times of war, so they planned to tie {{themselves}} up and admit their mistake to Cao Cao {{in the hope of}} receiving a lenient punishment. Cao Chong told them, [...] "Wait for three days before reporting the incident." [...] He used a knife to cut holes in his clothes, making it seem as though they had been damaged by rats, and then pretended to look upset. When his father asked him, he replied, [...] "There is a saying that a person whose clothes have been chewed by rats will encounter ill luck. Now, as this <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I fear something might happen." [...] Cao Cao said, [...] "This is just a superstition. There's nothing to worry about." [...] When the storekeepers reported the saddle incident to Cao Cao three days later, Cao Cao laughed and said, [...] "My son's clothes were with him, yet they were still chewed by rats, so {{it is not surprising that}} my saddle in the store was also damaged." [...] He did not pursue the matter.|$|E

6000|$|... "Neither did I," [...] I remarked grimly, [...] "until last night." [...] And then I {{told him}} what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> He listened eagerly to my story.|$|R
2500|$|Fox's {{overexposure}} in {{the media}} led several men's websites, such as AskMen, to boycott her in 2009, although some refused to do so, feeling that the boycott was a publicity stunt and therefore hypocritical. In response to the boycott, Fox told magazine Nylon, in September of that year, that [...] "the media blitz" [...] for Transformers resulted in an over-extension of her welcome {{in the media}}. [...] "I {{was part of a}} movie that [...] wanted to make sure would make $700million, so they oversaturated the media with their stars," [...] she said. [...] "I don't want to have people get completely sick of me before I’ve ever even done something legitimate." [...] She became much less prominent in the media by 2010, after starring in the less commercially successful films Jonah Hex and Passion Play. That same year, Fox said, [...] "My biggest regret is that I've assisted the media in making me into a cartoon character. I don't regret what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> but I regret the way I have dealt with it." [...] Dixon and Foster stated, [...] "The problem [...] faces is that the [...] construct has replaced the real {{in the minds of the}} public; and once established, a media persona is hard to recalibrate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alternate identities {{presented}} include [...] "Damita Jo", {{an aggressive}} persona mentioned during the album's title track and [...] "Sexhibition", and [...] "Strawberry", a lascivious performer who emerges on [...] "Strawberry Bounce". Speaking about the personae, Jackson said [...] "She's {{another way to}} express and expose a deeper part of me." [...] "Damita Jo" [...] is [...] "a lot harsher, and quick {{to put you in}} your place. She doesn't sit and ponder about stuff, where I'll go, 'Should I or shouldn't I?' She's tougher than I am. Then there's Strawberry. She's the most sexual of them all, the wildest." [...] Blender magazine commented the latter identity represents [...] "a time when she doesn't need to be the polite, professional Janet, and can turn into raw, unrestrained Strawberry." [...] Jackson added [...] "It's not an everyday indulgence. Not even every week. But every now and then I like playing around in that mode." [...] Jackson said the characters [...] "absolutely" [...] live inside of her, exclaiming [...] "it feels wonderful" [...] to release them. The concept is further explored in [...] "Looking for Love", in which Jackson says every individual is composed of [...] "many people rolled into one," [...] unified by a similar motive of seeking love, companionship, or identity. Jackson previously desired to record an album which was a [...] "complete departure" [...] from what she is known for and title it after her middle name, but was convinced to use the title for the album by producer Dallas Austin. The title was initially used as self-acceptance; saying [...] "My mother made up [...] "Damita." [...] I presumed [...] "Jo" [...] was for Joseph, my father, even though I later learned it wasn't. Because he was emotionally withdrawn, I was never comfortable using it. For years I didn't. Now I love being called Jo. I've come to the point where I'm trying to accept - even embrace - everything that <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I believe that without acceptance there's no serenity." ...|$|E
60|$|LIEUTENANT (confidently). You'll {{change your}} tone, General, {{when you hear}} what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "Some lifetimes," [...] said Mr. Chalk, gloomily. [...] "I’m fifty-one next year, and {{the only}} thing I ever <b>had</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> was seeing a man stop a runaway horse and cart." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's one for each, and {{a letter}} to tell which is whose. Grandma and Hannah made them, and I tremble to think what would <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> if I <b>had</b> {{forgotten}} to leave them." ...|$|R
60|$|GLORIA (with quiet scorn). What {{is the use}} {{of being}} weak? You see what has {{happened}} with this gentleman here, mother. The same thing <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{had better}} {{understand}} each other first," [...] he said. [...] "You have heard what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and will not find me a profitable customer to-day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you think, ladies?" [...] {{and she sat}} herself down, filling an arm-chair {{with her}} goodly person. [...] "What do you think <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to-day?" ...|$|E
60|$|This being knocked {{cold and}} {{motionless}} {{was perhaps the}} best thing that could <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> My violent struggles had only accelerated my already dangerously accelerated heart, and increased the need for oxygen in my suffocating lungs.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I {{should have}} left it so, too," [...] said Hernshaw. [...] "That always gives it a chance to explain itself. If such a thing <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> I should give {{it all the time}} it wanted." ...|$|R
60|$|I did {{not sleep}} well during {{that night on}} board the Spitfire. The place was strange <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and, besides, my mind was busy with the many things that <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> since I <b>had</b> left my uncle's home.|$|R
6000|$|... "In my case," [...] he replied, [...] "I do {{not think}} that exaggeration is possible. Everything <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that could {{possibly}} happen to any one in my unfortunate position." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must get}} home now," [...] said he {{in a rather}} faint voice. [...] "Mrs. Peter will be sure that {{something}} <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and will be worried almost to death." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Peter, do {{you care}} so much as that? If--if I could be sure that I were doing it for you! If in spite--of all that <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I could be doing {{something}} for you--!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And then, day by day, and week by week, {{that feeling}} grew deeper and stronger, {{until at last}} you {{swallowed}} up all my other hopes, and ambitions, and interests.

6000|$|... "And {{she never}} got my letter?" [...] he cried, [...] "and knew not what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> It is that wife of mine, that cruel wild-cat! I sent the letter to my house, thinking, of course, it would find my {{daughter}} there. For where else should she be?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to annoy you," [...] he said, [...] "but I must insist that to me the {{situation}} {{does not appear to}} be without some encouraging features. Let me tell you what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> since we parted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Ruth," [...] he pleaded, [...] "what have I done {{to deserve}} this? Nothing <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I {{will not tell}} you about. You have been sitting here alone, fancying things. And I have news--great news! Wait till you hear it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should feel}} the more hope, madam," [...] said Mr. Kilbright, [...] "were it not {{requisite}} {{that she be}} informed of all that <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> And all this must she know before I require her to make answer to me." ...|$|E
