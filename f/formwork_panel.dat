50|$|MEVA {{was founded}} in 1970 by Gerhard Dingler. The idea of {{developing}} a formwork system that would be re-usable led to the company’s foundation and to the first frame-based panelised formwork system with a facing integrated into a metal frame, the so-called <b>formwork</b> <b>panel.</b> The panels are produced in different sizes and can be freely combined, hence the name modular formwork system. In the course of its history, MEVA developed several innovations, part of which have become standard features in the industry.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} background work {{leading to}} the development of thin structural elements made of GFRC (Glass Fibre Reinforced Concrete) reinforced with FRP (Fiber Reinforced Polymer) bars. Such thin structural elements are suitable for a variety of applications such as cladding, security screens, etc, but this paper focuses on their use as permanent formwork. The first part of the paper deals with optimising a uniform thickness GFRC section to achieve maximum flexural capacity at minimum weight. The second part deals with the interaction between FRP and GFRC, in particular with the issues of bond. The third part presents the performance of a 3 m span thin GFRC permanent <b>formwork</b> <b>panel</b> system reinforced with FRP. Both experimental and analytical studies are presented and it is concluded that FRP/GFRC thin structural elements can be designed using conventional techniques requiring only the use of appropriate material characteristics...|$|E

40|$|USB zonder ISBNConsiderable {{attention}} is often dedicated {{to ensure the}} tightness of the formwork when placing ready-mixed self-compacting concrete (SCC). These sealing actions lead to additional costs, making the self-compacting concrete solution more expensive than casting traditional vibrated concrete. This paper {{presents the results of}} an experimental research, regarding the required tightness of the joints between <b>formwork</b> <b>panels</b> when using SCC as non-fair faced, structural concrete. First, small scale tests are executed using artificial increase of the pressure exerted onto the tested SCC inside the formwork. In the second phase of this research, experiments are conducted on real scale formwork constructions (up to 6 m of concrete height). A wide range of calibrated joint openings between the <b>formwork</b> <b>panels</b> are tested. During casting of the SCC the mortar loss through the gaps is visually observed. After removal of the formwork, the surface and corners of the hardened concrete elements are analysed. The acceptable gaps between the <b>formwork</b> <b>panels</b> can reach values of up to 7 mm and higher, without leading to honeycombing and/or too widely spread âinfectedâ zones on the concrete surface. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|The LLC {{has five}} cores, {{each with a}} {{different}} complex geometry. The core walls are inclined at different angles {{and so are the}} corners which are also rounded with different radii. MEVA has developed and uses both standard and special formwork, or a combination of both, to meet the forming requirements for these complex building parts. Steel formwork, for example, is used for rounded corners if required for structural reasons. Trapezoidal areas of inclined cylindrical corner areas are poured with special Mammut 350 wall <b>formwork</b> <b>panels</b> and special designs of MEVA’s circular column formwork Circo are used for the tilted and rounded corners.|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of a wider inquiry on the {{integration}} of material properties and construction processes in computational models, this paper proposes a digital model for fabric <b>formwork</b> <b>panels.</b> Plaster cast in different types of fabric can produce a significant variation of resulting forms. The aim is to investigate whether data retrieved from physical models with 3 D scanning techniques can improve the accuracy and efficiency of a simulation based on geometric principles, and better predict the behaviour of cast material in relation to the type of fabric. Setting up the computational model and choosing its parameters and constraints is based on the physical construction process, highlighting the relationship between material and form. As part of the cyclical exchange, evaluation of the digital model with physical testing demonstrates that the simulation can actually be trained by reducing the physical/ digital discrepancies...|$|R
40|$|A new {{construction}} method replacing rigid <b>formwork</b> <b>panels</b> with a flexible textile membrane that deflects under the dead weight of wet concrete, provides numerous advantages {{and opportunities for}} architecture, engineering, and construction technology in both advanced and basic building economies. Inexpensive formwork fabrics provide the options of sacrificial or reusable formworks in both precast and cast-in-place applications. Methods {{have been developed for}} fabric-cast foundations, walls, columns, capitals, slabs, and beams. Permeable membranes allow air bubbles and excess mix water to bleed out, producing a flawless, cement-rich finish and a stronger and more durable Òcase hardenedÓ concrete. Structurally efficient variable section members are easily formed, reducing dead weight and material expenses. Steel-free concrete structures are envisioned through the use of three dimensional compression geometries formed through a simple inversion of funicular curves. The paper introduces this new technology, citing current work and applications as well as future research opportunities...|$|R
5000|$|In 1958 {{the company}} branch Doka was founded. The company {{founding}} and company name are interlinked {{with their first}} product and projects. In Austria in the 1950s, large infrastructural construction was underway including several hydro electrical dams. The dams were being built on the Danube river (Donau) and its tributaries by the Austrian utility [...] "Donaukraftwerke" [...] or DOKW for short, translating as 'Danube power stations'. Because of the great size of these structures, traditional timber beam formwork was too labor-intensive to form the large walls. Thus a large scale systematic and reusable formwork was developed, with the wooden <b>formwork</b> <b>panels</b> being produced and shipped from the Amstetten company. Originally the DOKW was the delivery address, but then became the product name (DOKW boards). Linguistic usage slurred DOKW into DOKA, which became {{the name of the}} newly founded company.In 1961 the first subsidiary was established in Germany, followed in 1977 by Brazil and Kuwait. Since then Doka has grown to service countries in all inhabited continents, particularly in Europe and the Middle East, and in the English speaking countries Great Britain, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the United States. Doka have a well established Office in Qatar.|$|R

This paper reports on the findings of a study, consisting of a questionnaire survey, interviews and work-site visits, to compare the use of low-waste building technologies in public housing and private residential projects in Hong Kong. The results show that large <b>panel</b> <b>formwork</b> and prefabricated building components are widely used in public housing projects in Hong Kong. Due to the difference of the design with public housing, the use of smaller aluminium <b>panel</b> <b>formwork</b> is more common in the private housing projects. The barriers for the adoption of low-waste building technologies in the private sector are identified and discussed. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R

50|$|Construction {{was started}} in August 1947, but due to the marshland-geology of the site, main ground works {{contractor}} Robert M Douglas was forced to devise {{a new type of}} formwork for its construction. Timber was the traditional material for such purposes, but immediately post-war could only be obtained on permit from the Ministry of Supply. The quantity allocated by the ministry was inadequate to maintain the required progress of the work, so alternative means of providing the necessary formwork were investigated. Limited quantities of cold steel plate were available, and the timber obtained by permit was to a considerable extent used as framing to which the steel plate was fixed. The available quantities were soon absorbed and the supply was augmented by the purchase of now redundant Anderson-type air raid shelters, which were rolled flat and pressed into panels of uniform size. This was the first steel <b>panel</b> <b>formwork</b> system ever deployed in the world.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} self-manufacturing cost estimation, cost optimization {{and competitiveness}} of different composite floor systems: composite I beams, composite trusses produced from rolled channel sections and composite trusses made from cold formed hollow sections. Part 1 of this two-part series of papers presents {{the estimation of}} the self-manufacturing (direct production) costs for composite and steel structures. The self-manufacturing costs are proposed to {{be defined as the}} sum of the material, the power consumption and the labour costs. The material costs of the structural steel, concrete, reinforcement, the shear connectors, electrodes, the anti-corrosion, fire protection and top coat painting, the <b>formwork</b> floor-slab <b>panels</b> and gas consumption are presented in detail. The power consumption costs comprise costs of sawing the steel sections, edge grinding, drilling, welding, stud welding and vibrating the concrete. The labour costs (times) presented define the costs of metal cutting, edge grinding, preparation, assembling and tacking, welding, welding of shear connectors, steel surface preparation and protection, drilling, cutting, placing and connecting the reinforcement, concreting, consolidating and curing the concrete. New approximation functions are proposed for the calculation of some manufacturing times and material consumptions. As the discussed costs vary significantly around the world, the proposed cost expressions are given in the open form to be used for cost estimation in different economic conditions. A numerical example of the estimation of the self-manufacturing costs for a composite I beam floor system shows the suitability of the proposed approach. On the basis of the defined self-manufacturing costs, introduced in Part 1, the cost optimization and the competitiveness of different composite floor systems are discussed in Part 2...|$|R
40|$|The {{shortage}} of skilled laborers in Japan has {{been pointed out}} {{as one of the}} causes of the deterioration of buildings in recent years. This paper presents a new permanent formwork system designed to simplify complicated procedures in the fabrication of form. Glass-fiber reinforced concrete panels (G. R. C. panels) and aluminum frames are mainly used in the new <b>formwork</b> system. The <b>panels</b> are used for the sheathing boards which contain the freshly mixed concrete, and the aluminum frames support the panels to hold the configuration of the panels. Line scratching is made on the inner surface of the panels, a method which improves the adhesion strength between the panel and the concrete after the hardening of concrete. Construction experiments using the new formwork system were made to investigate the efficiency of the system. The experimental data, such as the accuracy of dimension at the finish of work, the adhesion strength between the panel and the concrete, and the time of work, were compared with the date used in a conventional formwork system. The conclusions are as follows: the time of work and human energy required for the fabrication of these panels were effectively shortened by introducing the new formwork system: a deterioration of adhesion strength was not observed {{over a period of several}} months: and, therefore, the new formwork system is superior to the previous system and available for practical use. ...|$|R
