Average values for the following three parametres of calls were calculated (±SE) : lenght of call 278. 3 ± 3. 69 ms (min 228 -max 371 ms), time interval between calls 2. 72 ± 0. 05 s (min 2. 08 -max 3. 39 s) and fundamental frequency of call 1. 32 ± 0. 01 kHz (min 1. 17 -max 1. 50 kHz). Discriminant function analysis successfully separated recordings of differents males {{on the basis of}} above mentioned parametres (Wilkins’l= 0. 0027, P< 0. 001). Variables considered in the model were length of call and time interval between calls, whereas fundamental frequency was omit-ted as its variance between individuals was too low. Both discriminant functions were statistically significant (p< 0. 001), the first one accounting for 90 % of variance, and both together for 100 % of variance. Considering the fact that Scops Owls may form larger calling groups and may breed in loose colonies where conditions are favourable, this method represents a very important tool for accurate determination of the number of calling males. Recordings of Scops Owl are relatively easy to obtain as the species is highly vocal and males respond well to playback of another male. The method is also less time-consuming for the surveyor and less disturbing for the bird, compared to capturing and banding...|$|R
