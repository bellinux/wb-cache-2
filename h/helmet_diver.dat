5000|$|In 1912 Fernez set up {{a company}} to mass-produce his equipment, which was very {{successful}} {{because it was a}} fraction of the price of a traditional diving suit, and was also simple, compact, lightweight, easily portable and quick to put into operation - a few minutes compared to the half an hour a traditional <b>helmet</b> <b>diver</b> would take to get ready. The set of equipment was contained in a wooden box and weighed 12 kg, and cost 200 francs. It sold to many countries, and Fernez became so well known that he once received a letter addressed simply to [...] "Monsieur Fernez - France".|$|E
5000|$|In 1867, an inventor, Willem Hendrik ter Meulen, {{proposed}} using a 'zandboor' ('sand drill'), {{a device}} which forced {{water into the}} sandy sea bed in order to clear a way for a <b>helmet</b> <b>diver</b> and signed a three-year contract, subsequently extended for another three years and then a further twenty years. The plan was that when the depth of water reached 7 m, the machine {{would be used to}} excavate the same depth of sand down onto the wreck. Ter Meulen bought a steel-hulled, paddlewheel-driven 50 h.p. steam tug, Antagonist. The engine was modified such that it could be disconnected from the paddlewheels and used to drive the centrifugal 'whirlpool' pump. The pump was capable of pumping water at a rate of , but tests showed that [...] was sufficient, and the 'zandboor' took only a couple of minutes to penetrate through to the wreck. It was also found that the sand did not collapse once the diver descended through the drilled hole into the cavity excavated by the machine.|$|E

50|$|The Dr√§ger rebreathers, {{especially}} the DM20 and DM40 model series, {{were used by}} the German <b>helmet</b> <b>divers</b> and German frogmen during World War II. Rebreathers for the US Navy were developed by Dr. Christian J. Lambertsen for underwater warfare. Lambertsen held the first closed-circuit oxygen rebreather course in the United States for the Office of Strategic Services maritime unit at the Naval Academy on 17 May 1943.|$|R

50|$|The <b>helmet</b> <b>divers</b> used heavily {{weighted}} {{shoes to}} steady {{them on the}} bottom. The weighted sole is bolted to a wooden insole, {{which in turn has}} a leather, canvas or rubber upper. Lead was the most common sole and a pair could weigh up to 34 lb. Brass soled shoes with canvas uppers were introduced in WWII and are still in use. Some early brass shoes were called sandals because they were a casting held to the diver's feet by simple straps. Japanese divers often used iron soled shoes. The diver tends to lean forward against the drag of the water when walking on the bottom, and could often not see where he was putting his feet, so the toes are capped, usually with brass.|$|R

50|$|A {{continuous}} flow of compressed air is {{provided to the}} helmet and vented to the surrounding water at a pressure {{very close to the}} ambient pressure at the exhaust port, which lets the diver breathe normally. The helmet must have a non-return valve at the air inlet port of the helmet, to prevent massive and fatal squeeze, should the air line be cut at the surface. Diving helmets, while very heavy, displace a great deal of water and combined with the air in the suit, would make the diver float with his head out of the water. To overcome this, some helmets are weighted on the corselet, while other divers wear weighted belts which have straps that go over the corselet. Some divers have an air inlet control valve, while others may have only one control, the exhaust back-pressure. <b>Helmet</b> <b>divers</b> are subject to the same pressure limitations as other divers, such as decompression sickness and nitrogen narcosis.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she pointed}} to and bade us don, two strange {{garments}} that hung upon the wall, made of a material {{which seemed to be}} half cloth and half wood and having headpieces not unlike a <b>diver's</b> <b>helmet.</b>|$|R
25|$|The diver is exhaling into {{a vessel}} {{that does not}} allow all the CO2 to escape to the environment, such as a long snorkel, full face diving mask, or diving <b>helmet,</b> and the <b>diver</b> then re-inhales from that vessel, causing {{increased}} dead space.|$|R

[...] "Sack coats come into fashion, and dumpy little men trot {{up and down in}} them, looking like butter-tubs on legs. You go about in July melting under frock-coats and chimney-pot hats, and because it is the stylish thing to do, you all play tennis in still shirts and stand-up collars, which is idiotic. If fashion decreed that you should play cricket in a pair of top-boots and a <b>diver's</b> <b>helmet,</b> you would play cricket in a pair of top-boots and a <b>diver's</b> <b>helmet,</b> and dub every sensible fellow who didn't a cad. It's worse in you than in us; men are supposed to think for themselves, and to be capable of it, the womanly woman isn't." ...|$|R
25|$|The helmet {{is usually}} made of two main parts: the bonnet, which covers the diver's head, and the corselet which {{supports}} {{the weight of}} the <b>helmet</b> on the <b>diver's</b> shoulders, and is clamped to the suit to create a watertight seal. The bonnet is attached and sealed to the corselet at the neck, either by bolts or an interrupted screw-thread, with some form of locking mechanism.|$|R
25|$|The AP Valves Mk4 Jump Jacket is {{a harness}} with {{integral}} buoyancy jacket {{specifically designed for}} commercial diving work with helmets and bells. There is a direct feed to the jacket from the main air supply, from the pneumo line and from bailout, and a system which allows the diver's pneumo to be directly connected to another <b>diver's</b> <b>helmet</b> as an emergency air supply.|$|R

60|$|This {{man was a}} {{very large}} fellow, with a dark surly countenance--not exactly bad in expression, but rather ill-tempered-looking. His diving-dress being {{necessarily}} very wide and baggy, made him seem larger than he really was--indeed, quite gigantic. The dress was made of very thick india-rubber cloth, and all--feet, legs, body, and arms--was of one piece, so perfectly secured at the seams as to be thoroughly impervious to air or water. To get into {{it was a matter}} of some difficulty, the entrance being effected at the neck. When this neck is properly attached to the <b>helmet,</b> the <b>diver</b> is thoroughly cut off from the external world, except through the air-tube communicating with his helmet and the pump afore mentioned.|$|R
50|$|In 1934, Colley {{was handed}} a new assignment: help {{pioneering}} pilot Wiley Post reach the jet stream and break new altitude records. Post needed a pressurized suit, and Colley designed him one using his wife's sewing machine. The pressure suit had three layers: the innermost one was long underwear, the middle layer was a rubberized air pressure bladder, {{and the outer}} layer was made of rubberized parachute fabric. Rubber boots, pigskin gloves, and a <b>diver's</b> <b>helmet</b> with a removable faceplate were added.|$|R
50|$|Lever pumps {{have two}} cylinders, which are {{operated}} by rocking a beam with handles attached to its ends which is pivoted at the centre. The piston rods {{are connected to}} the beam {{on either side of the}} pivot. Upward movement of the pistons pulls the air into the cylinders through the inlet valves, and then downward movement pumps the air through the hose to the <b>helmet</b> of the <b>diver.</b> Cylinders, valves and outlet for air are made from brass for the most reliability.|$|R
60|$|Sparkling bubbles {{from his}} and the <b>diver's</b> <b>helmets</b> floated {{straight}} {{up to the}} skylights, along which they glided and vanished {{through a hole in}} the glass. The water, moving gently with the pulse of the swell, broke the beam of light and objects it touched were distorted and magnified. The top of the big low-pressure cylinder looked gigantic, and the thick columns appeared to bend. Long weed clung to the platforms, from which iron ladders went down, but so far as Lister could distinguish, all below was buried in sand.|$|R
50|$|Rotary {{pumps are}} driven by a {{crankshaft}} that is rotated by handles on two flywheels attached {{to the ends of}} the shaft on each side of the pump. Rotary pumps can be built with two and three cylinders, and are operated by a team of two men. Pistons attached to the crankshaft draw in air through the inlet valves and then pump it through the outlet valves to an air hose which delivers the air to the <b>helmet</b> of the <b>diver.</b> Cylinders, valves and outlet fittings for air are generally made from brass for corrosion resistance in the marine environment.|$|R
5000|$|His first billet as a hardhat diver was {{aboard the}} , a newly {{commissioned}} Gleaves-class destroyer. The ship entered {{the wreckage of}} Pearl Harbor for last minute repairs and refitting before proceeding to the ocean war in the South Pacific. Qualified divers on all vessels entering Pearl Harbor were temporarily assigned to the base to assist in salvage of sunken ships. Boehm was tasked with salvaging the sunken [...] and diving to recover corpses and ammunition. Boehm confessed that he found the job of recovering dead sailors so distressing that he actually vomited inside his <b>diver's</b> <b>helmet</b> {{the first time he}} was required to do it.|$|R
60|$|He sat up. His head bandage {{had become}} loose and got over one eye, and he whipped {{the whole thing}} off. Kurt was also sitting up, a yard away from him, pink as ever, wrapped in blankets, and with an {{aluminium}} <b>diver's</b> <b>helmet</b> over his knee, staring {{at him with a}} severe expression, and rubbing his downy unshaven chin. They were both on a slanting floor of crimson padding, and above them was an opening like a long, low cellar flap that Bert by an effort perceived to be the cabin door in a half-inverted condition. The whole cabin had in fact turned on its side.|$|R
6000|$|When he came {{to himself}} again, his head was on Attwater's arm, and close by stood {{one of the men}} in <b>diver's</b> <b>helmets,</b> holding a bucket of water, from which his late executioner now laved his face. The memory of that dreadful passage {{returned}} upon him in a clap; again he saw Huish lying dead, again he seemed to himself to totter on the brink of an unplumbed eternity. With trembling hands he seized hold of the man whom he had come to slay; and his voice broke from him like that of a child among the nightmares of fever: [...] "O! isn't there no mercy? O! what must I do to be saved?" ...|$|R
50|$|Once {{under the}} bell, the bellman would hook the lifting tackle {{to one or}} more of the D-rings {{provided}} for this purpose on the diver's harness, then enter the bell and hoist the diver in, taking care to avoid and release any snags, which may require the bellman to work below the water surface. Once the diver is in the bell, CPR should be started if the diver is not breathing. This requires the <b>diver's</b> <b>helmet</b> to be removed. If this must be done with the diver suspended from the hoist, the divers body must remain in the water to help preserve blood supply to the upper body and head by hydrostatic pressure.|$|R
50|$|A {{wide range}} of Victorian and Edwardian era {{memorial}} symbols are also on display throughout the cemetery, including Calvary crosses, Celtic crosses, draped urns, broken columns, broken chain, mourning angels and cherubs, carved garlands, flowers (passion flowers, roses, poppies), ivy, grapes, and clasped hands. Each of these has a particular symbolic meaning. Some ornamentation references the deceased's occupation, hobby or sporting interest - such as a <b>diver's</b> <b>helmet,</b> tools, weaver's apron, tennis racquets and balls, cricket bat and stumps, motor cycles, and a camera. There are also a variety of grave ornaments, including many immortelles and urns for holding flowers, and some graves are decorated with sea shells. Several graves and family plots have symbolic plantings, such as olive trees (Olea europaea) and cypresses.|$|R
50|$|A {{freeflow}} diving {{gas supply}} has a continuous flow of breathing gas (almost always air) to the <b>diver's</b> <b>helmet,</b> {{or in some}} cases, full-face mask. The gas flows {{regardless of whether the}} diver breathes it, and most of the gas supply is not used. This is wasteful, so is generally only used when the breathing gas is air, which is cheap, and can be supplied from a low pressure compressor. Freeflow helmets were used in early diving apparatus, and the historically important Standard Diving gear with the copper helmet is a free-flow system. The system is simple and robust, and relatively safe in contaminated water as the internal pressure of the helmet can be maintained at a slightly higher setting than the external pressure to prevent leaks back through the exhaust valve.|$|R
5000|$|To denote {{additional}} qualifications {{within a}} particular rate, the Kriegsmarine issued a number of [...] "trade badges" [...] which were worn as red on blue patches beneath either the seaman's rank chevron or petty officer's badge. Trade badges were not worn or displayed by either officers or chiefs.Qualification trade insignia was issued in up to four classes, beginning with a basic badge followed by apprentice, journeyman, and master. All trade badges above basic were denoted by chevrons on the trade patch; some trade patches were authorized up to all three chevrons while others were eligible for only one or two. One of the more common engineering trade badges was that of Handwerker (damage controlman) which appeared as a red <b>diver's</b> <b>helmet</b> and was issued up to the master qualification level.|$|R
50|$|The body of {{the suit}} had three layers: long underwear, an inner black rubber air {{pressure}} bladder, and an outer layer made of rubberized parachute fabric. The outer layer was glued to a frame with arm and leg joints {{that allowed him to}} operate the flight controls and to walk to and from the aircraft. Attached to the frame were pigskin gloves, rubber boots, and an aluminum-and-plastic <b>diver's</b> <b>helmet.</b> The helmet had a removable faceplate that could be sealed at a height of 17,000 ft, and could accommodate earphones and a throat microphone. The helmet was cylinder-shaped with a circular window. In the first flight using the suit on September 5, 1934, Post reached an altitude of 40,000 ft above Chicago. Eventually flying as high as 50,000 ft, Post discovered the jet stream and made the first major practical advances in pressurized flight. As of 2011 the suit is currently being restored.|$|R
5000|$|Cambridge Seven Associates {{recently}} {{worked with}} the museum on upgrades to the Giant Ocean Tank, as well as creating other exhibits. As a final part to their five-year $42 million upgrade, which started in 2007, the New England Aquarium renovated its Giant Ocean Tank from Labor Day of 2012 to July 2013. The [...] tank received enlarged viewing windows, a new reef designed to represent the pre-Columbian Caribbean reef, enhanced lighting, and a reflective domed ceiling overhead. In addition, the wooden wall encircling the ocean tank was replaced with a transparent acrylic wall to facilitate better viewing; a new ramp was constructed from the fourth floor elevator {{to the top of}} tank; a new education center was located on the top floor; giant screens were added that connect to a <b>diver's</b> <b>helmet</b> camera for onlookers to see; and on the ground floor a new exhibit called the Blue Planet Action Center was constructed to show the aquarium's conservancy efforts.|$|R
5|$|In 1927, Beebe went on an {{expedition}} to Haiti in order to document its marine life. Anchoring his ship the Lieutenant in the harbor of Port-au-Prince, he performed over 300 helmet dives examining the area's coral reefs and classifying the fish that inhabited them. These dives involved several technological innovations: a watertight brass box {{which could be used}} to house a camera for underwater photography, and a telephone which was incorporated into the diving <b>helmet,</b> allowing the <b>diver</b> to dictate observations to someone on the surface instead of having to take notes underwater. Within a hundred days, Beebe and his team had created a catalog of species inhabiting the area nearly as long as what had been assembled on the neighboring island of Puerto Rico in the past four hundred years. In 1928 Beebe and Tee-Van published an illustrated and annotated list of 270 such species, which was expanded in 1935 bringing the total to 324. Beebe provided an account of this expedition in his 1928 book Beneath Tropic Seas, which was the first of his books to receive less than enthusiastic reviews, due to its episodic structure.|$|R
25|$|The {{stand by}} diver will be {{prepared}} {{in the same}} way as the working diver, but will not enter the water until needed. He will usually be prepared to the stage of readiness to enter the water, and then will remove his mask, or have his helmet removed and will then sit in as comfortable a place as can be found, so that in case of an emergency he can be readied for action in as short a time as possible. This often means setting up some form of shelter from the weather, and heat and sunshine are usually more of a problem than cold and wet. It is frequently necessary to cool the standby diver to avoid overheating, and dehydration can also be a problem. When the working diver is using a <b>helmet,</b> the standby <b>diver</b> may use a full face mask or bandmask, as this makes it quicker to get into the water in an emergency. The stand by diver's job is to wait until something goes wrong, and then be sent in to sort it out. For this reason a stand by diver should be one of the best divers on the team regarding diving skills and strength, but does not have to be expert at the work skills for the specific job. When deployed, the standby diver will normally follow the umbilical of the diver who is in trouble, as unless it has been severed, it will reliably lead to the correct diver. The standby diver must maintain communications with the supervisor throughout the dive and is expected to give a running commentary of progress so that the supervisor and surface crew know as much as possible what is happening and can plan accordingly, and must take the necessary steps to resolve incidents, which may involve supply of emergency air or locating and rescuing an injured or unconscious diver. In bell diving, the bellman is the standby diver, and may have to recover a distressed diver to the bell and give first aid if necessary and possible.|$|R
