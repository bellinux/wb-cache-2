40|$|Ionospheric {{modification}} by {{high power}} radio waves and by chemical releases are combined in a theoretical study of ionospheric focused heating. The release of materials which promote electron-ion recombination creates {{a hole in}} the bottomside ionosphere. The ionospheric hole focuses high power radio waves from a <b>ground-based</b> <b>transmitter</b> to give a 20 dB or greater enhancement in power density. The intense radio beam excites atomic oxygen by collisions with accelerated electrons. Airglow from the excited oxygen provides a visible trace of the focused beam. The large increase in the intensity of the radio beam stimulates new wave-plasma interactions. Numerical simulations show that the threshold for the two-plasmon decay instability is exceeded. The interaction of the pump electromagnetic wave with the backward plasmon produces a scattered electromagnetic wave at 3 / 2 the pump frequency.

The sun-synchronous orbits of the DEMETER satellite lead us to cover an invariant latitude range between- 65 • and + 65 • in a time interval of about 40 minutes. We select three <b>ground-based</b> <b>transmitter</b> stations localised in Australia (NWC, 19. 8 kHz), in Germany (DFY, 16. 58 kHz) and in Japan (JP, 17. 8 kHz). We analyse the complete set of data recorded from August 2004 to December 2010. We distinguish between the VLF signals observed when the satellite was on day-or night-sides of the Earth at about 22 LT and 10 LT, respectively. We characterize the reception condition of the VLF signal taking into consideration the satellite position above the transmitter stations. We find that the signal amplitude is increasing (up to a maximum) and decreasing (down to a minimum) in a time interval of about 12 days. This 'regular' reception of the VLF signal is a signature of quiet ionosphere behaviour above the transmitter stations. We discuss in our contribution about the time intervals where the VLF signals were almost not detected.

40|$|In 2011, the Canadian {{enhanced}} Polar Outflow Probe (ePOP) satellite will be launched. The ePOP satellite {{is equipped}} with several scientific Earth observation instruments, including a Radio Receiver Instrument (RRI) which {{will be used to}} detect High Frequency (HF) radio waves transmitted from a <b>ground-based</b> <b>transmitter.</b> The ground-based instrument {{will be one of the}} Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) array of radars. A radio wave transmitted from the SuperDARN radar will propagate through the ionosphere and be detected by the RRI on ePOP. Analysis of the characteristics of the signal received by the RRI will provide information about the plasma density in the ionosphere between the transmitter and receiver. As the ePOP satellite is not yet operational, extensive ray path modelling has been performed to simulate the expected signal at the RRI for various ionospheric conditions. The other major objective of this research was to examine the effect of the variable refractive index in the ionosphere on SuperDARN drift velocity measurements. Past comparisons between velocities measured by SuperDARN and other instruments have found that velocities measured by SuperDARN typically were about 20 - 30 % lower. This research has shown that underestimation of drift velocities by SuperDARN is a consequence of not including the refractive index when these velocities are calculated. As refractive index measurements are not readily available, this research has involved developing and implementing various methods to estimate the refractive index in the ionosphere. These methods have demonstrated that plasma density values within the SuperDARN scattering volume are appreciably higher than background plasma densities in the ionosphere. Application of these methods, which has resulted in a much better understanding of the physics of the coherent scattering process, has resulted in agreement between velocities measured by SuperDARN and other instruments...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the course}} of the last years, civil {{aeronautics}} have been undergoing a perpetual innovation: the way we communicate, navigate, and survey the airspace is currently being redefined. In the past, pilots mainly relied on DME (distance measuring equipment) and VOR (VHF omnidirectional radio range) for navigation. Compared to state-of-the-art navigation aids these systems offer only a limited performance while being spectrally inefficient. Therefore, it is planned in the future to rely on global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) for navigation. GNSS offers a highly superior navigation performance as compared to that obtained with legacy DME/VOR infrastructure. To guarantee the required degree of integrity, GNSS systems will be accompanied with ground or satellite based augmentation systems (G/SBAS). However, an increased use of GNSS for aviation brings new challenges. Especially integrity, continuity, and availability of navigational information are of exceptional importance in a safety-of-life environment. Due to the low power levels received from in-orbit satellites, GNSS signals are susceptible interferences, both intentional and unintentional. Hence a ground based navigational backup system, referred to as alternative positioning, navigation and timing (APNT), needs to be employed. These systems should be used when GNSS services become temporarily unavailable. Different proposals for APNT are currently being discussed. One approach is based on the legacy system DME. The major advantage of DME is that it allows reusing the existing infrastructure; in fact, DMEs can be currently used as an APNT system. However, a large drawback of this solution is the continued use of old, spectrally-inefficient technology. But, what is more important, is that once the transition to GNSS-based air traffic management has been realized, a DME-based APNT solution will not be able to support the same level of navigational information in terms of accuracy or precision. Thus, alternative APNT approaches that provide accurate positioning, while at the same time allowing for a “gentle” phasing out of DMEs, are needed. One such example is the future communication system LDACS 1, which signals can be also used for ranging and positioning. Hereby, communication infrastructure can also be employed for navigation purposes. Independently of the underlying technology, the majority of the APNT proposals are ground-based systems with planned allocation in the L-band. If, however, the future APNT systems are to deliver highly accurate positioning information, it is crucial to understand the characteristics of the ground-to-air (G 2 A) L-band wireless propagation channel in more detail. Yet this remains a challenging task as channel models for L-band G 2 A useable for testing and validation of range estimators are sparse. The existing models are extensions of classical statistical channel models developed for wireless communication applications. Thus, dependable simulations of the navigation performance of the proposed systems are hard to realize. To address this challenge, DLR has conducted in 2013 an extensive channel measurement campaign in the L-band. To this end, the setup consisted of a <b>ground-based</b> <b>transmitter</b> located on top of a building in an airport, and a receiver in a research aircraft Dassault Falcon 20 E. For both the transmitter and receiver commercial L-band antennas were employed. The measurement bandwidth was set to 10 MHz with a center frequency at the lower end of the L-band at 965 MHz; the transmit power was set to 39 dBm. Different flight patterns were tested in order to allow an extensive investigation of the channel characteristics. These include flights at different altitudes and transmitter-receiver separations, approach on the airport, take-off and landing. First preliminary analysis of the recorded data identifies an interesting characteristic of the L-band G 2 A channel relevant for navigation applications: for all altitudes multiple propagation paths can be observed. This effect is especially profound at low altitudes. The multipath is prone to occur in close vicinity to the transmitter, but excess delays sometimes reaching up to a few kilometers. The additional propagation paths are also strongly correlated in Doppler domain. As the result, for ranging and positioning applications such multipaths cause a strong interference to the direct path, significantly biasing the output of the correlator tuned to the line of sight (LOS) path. Furthermore, the spatial proximity of the different propagation paths complicates their separation and detection. This makes the compensation of the multipath effects a very challenging task. Especially for systems with low bandwidths, such as DME or LDACS 1 that are considered for APNT services, multiple propagation paths represent a significant error source. Data collected in previous flight trials show that errors in the region of hundreds of meters are possible when ranging with a low bandwidth system in strong multipath environment. In the final paper we will discuss the above mentioned problems in more details. We will begin by outlining the goals of the channel measurement campaigns and explain the measurement setup used in our measurements. The latter includes a short description of both the hardware and software employed during the campaign as well as the applied algorithms. Then, we will concentrate on the analysis of the measurement data. Hereby a special focus is placed on the multipath characterization of the G 2 A channel using a novel superresolution multipath estimation algorithm. The paper is concluded with a discussion of the obtained results and outline of the future investigation directions...|$|E
