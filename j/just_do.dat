5|$|With {{the deaths}} in the 2000s of Billy Wilder, George Sidney, Elia Kazan, Robert Wise, and Jules Dassin, Donen became the last {{surviving}} notable film director of Hollywood's Golden Age. He occasionally appears at film festivals and retrospectives and has continued to develop ideas for film projects. He {{was the subject of}} the 2010 documentary Stanley Donen: You <b>Just</b> <b>Do</b> It.|$|E

5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was {{and so it was}} a really nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to <b>just</b> <b>do</b> a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E

25|$|This {{does not}} mean that they are not {{purebred}} Chihuahuas; they <b>just</b> <b>do</b> not meet the requirements to enter a conformation show. Oversized Chihuahuas are seen in some of the best, and worst, bloodlines. Chihuahuas do not breed true for size, and puppies from the same litter can mature drastically different sizes from one another. As well, larger breeding females are less likely to experience dystocia. Typically, the breed standard for both the long and short coat Chihuahua will be identical except for the description of the coat. Chihuahuas have large, round eyes and large, erect ears, set in a high, dramatically rounded skull.|$|E
25|$|Georgia has its Embassy in Tel Aviv, and the State of Israel has its Embassy in Tbilisi. In June 2013, Georgian Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili {{praised the}} Jewish people and Israel and {{has sought to}} {{increase}} relations between Israel and Georgia elucidating his special relationship between him, Georgia and the Jewish people. Ivanishvili also wanted to extend strategic partnerships and as well as furthering economic cooperation by {{making it easier for}} Israeli entrepreneurs and investors to not <b>just</b> <b>do</b> business in Israel, but also facilitate the right paths to do business for the Georgians. The Israel-Georgia Chamber of Business was established in 1996 in order to facilitate business transactions between the two friendly countries and acting as a guide for Israeli businesses through the Georgian economy. Major sectors include insurance, real estate and construction, medical and dental solutions, industrial and utility projects, and energy.|$|E
25|$|Channing {{continued}} {{her return to}} the stage by teaming up again with playwright John Guare. She received Tony Award nominations for her performances in his plays, The House of Blue Leaves (1986) and Six Degrees of Separation (1990), for which she also won an Obie Award. The Alan Ayckbourn play Woman in Mind received its American premiere Off-Broadway in February 1988 at the Manhattan Theatre Club. The production was directed by Lynne Meadow and the cast included Channing {{in the role of}} Susan, for which she won a Drama Desk Award for Best Actress. When once asked if Susan was Channing's most fully realized character, the actress replied: Well, you like to think that they’re all fully realized because what you’re doing is different from what anyone else is seeing. You do a character but {{how much of it is}} on film, or how much of it is seen by an audience, is really up to the director, the piece, or the audience. And so, I <b>just</b> <b>do</b> these people. And flesh them out. I think anything else is not my job.|$|E

25|$|The {{reason for}} the sad state of public transit is a very basic one - the transit systems <b>just</b> <b>do</b> not offer a service which will attract people away from their automobiles. Consequently, their {{patronage}} comes very largely from those who cannot drive, either because they are too young, too old, or because they are too poor to own and operate an automobile. Look {{at it from the}} standpoint of a commuter who lives in a suburb and is trying to get to work in the central business district (CBD). If he is going to go by transit, a typical scenario might be the following: he must first walk to the closest bus stop, let us say a five or ten minute walk, and then he may have to wait up to another ten minutes, possibly in inclement weather, for the bus to arrive. When it arrives, he may have to stand unless he is lucky enough to find a seat. The bus will be caught up in street congestion and move slowly, and it will make many stops completely unrelated to his trip objective. The bus may then let him off at a terminal to a suburban train. Again he must wait, and, after boarding the train, again experience a number of stops {{on the way to the}} CBD, and possibly again he may have to stand in the aisle. He will get off at the station most convenient to his destination and possibly have to transfer again onto a distribution system. It is no wonder that in those cities where ample inexpensive parking is available, most of those who can drive do drive.|$|E

The former ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet also denounced {{the possibility of a}} return of the Deutsche Mark.|$|E

NME {{described}} the tracks as [...] "an experimental, heavy sounding 70s riff," [...] "a strong, melodic love song" [...] and [...] "an unexpected mix of big guitars and a bold horn section," ...|$|E

In a video shared on {{her social}} channels she said: [...] "I don't usually believe politicians, but I think Corbyn is actually, like, real." [...] She added: [...] "So {{this is a}} {{once in a lifetime}} opportunity – please go vote. You don't have to trust a politician or vote ever again, but <b>just</b> <b>do</b> it now." ...|$|E

[...] He was {{subsequently}} placed {{on the disabled list}} a few days later, but returned to play on May 20. [...] "It's frustrating not being able to play", he said. [...] "Watching baseball is not something I like to do." ...|$|E
500|$|Egan {{joked that}} {{although}} [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] was [...] "fun" [...] to perform, she felt much more [...] "white" [...] than usual recording alongside the five singers {{cast as the}} Muses, who provide the song's back up vocals. Familiar with singers Cheryl Freeman, Lillias White, Vaneese Y. Thomas, LaChanze and Roz Ryan's Broadway work, Egan felt intimated by their powerful voices and riffing abilities. Egan recalled, [...] "Alan would say, 'Okay Lillias (White), <b>just</b> <b>do</b> a riff over there and LaChanze, you do a little something over here and Susan, just at the end, get from this note to this note and <b>just</b> <b>do</b> a riff.' I raise my hand and I'm like, 'Umm, can you plunk {{it out on the}} piano?' He looks at me like, 'Are you kidding?'" [...] While it took Egan half an hour to solidify only one of her riffs, the other singers recorded multiple takes of theirs within that same time; Egan was greatly humbled by the experience. On the film's soundtrack, only Egan and Freeman are credited as vocalists on the track. Menken also produced the song. Danny Troob arranged the song while Michael Kosarin conducted the orchestration.|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{was also}} {{associated}} with the editing process of the video. She was Renck's editing supervisor. Madonna wanted a raw documentary look for the video which allowed her to be portrayed more realistically. Regarding the making of [...] "Hung Up", Renck {{said that it was}} a massive work to undertake, [...] "It's like you form this little family that's flourished and prospered for the month, and then you chop it down like a tree, [...] You come out with a sense of yearning and longing, like, 'Can we <b>just</b> <b>do</b> that again? Please?'" ...|$|E
500|$|James used various audio setups when {{composing}} Syros material. He {{noted that}} by rearranging equipment—and often keeping the same setup for around just five minutes—it {{allowed him to}} explore more writing possibilities; he said [...] "that will achieve some sort of purpose, so the way I've wired it together becomes the track in itself." [...] James also explained that when composing the [...] "logical {{thing to do is}} not change anything and <b>just</b> <b>do</b> another one using the same set of sounds", but during Syros recording sessions he would often [...] "get bored and swap things out".|$|E
500|$|Because Scheyer's {{talent was}} obvious {{by the time}} he was set to start high school, many people {{encouraged}} his parents to move so he could attend a high school with a powerhouse basketball program. [...] The move was recommended so that he would have a greater chance of success. Scheyer shrugged off the suggestion, telling his parents: [...] "We'll <b>just</b> <b>do</b> it here. We'll build the success at Glenbrook North." [...] His father said: [...] "I get chills thinking about it. [...] That wasn't my vision. [...] It wasn't Laury's. It wasn't his coaches'. [...] That was Jon's vision, and it never occurred to him that anything else would happen." ...|$|E
5000|$|Followership is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} the actions of someone in a subordinate role. It can also be considered as a specific set of skills that complement leadership, a role within a hierarchical organization, a social construct that is integral to the leadership process, or the behaviours engaged in while interacting with leaders in an effort to meet organizational objectives. In organizations, “leadership is not <b>just</b> <b>done</b> by the leader, and followership is not <b>just</b> <b>done</b> by followers.” ...|$|R
