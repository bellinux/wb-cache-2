25|$|Experimenting {{with the}} new technology, the forest glassmakers found it {{difficult}} to achieve the high standards of clarity and colour of the Roman methods, due mainly to the great variability of colour-controlling elements in the raw materials. European sand and soil is generally higher in iron and manganese. Iron gives a blue-green tinge to glass under usual <b>furnace</b> <b>atmosphere</b> conditions, but also may give a yellow colour. Manganese has its own purple colour which may balance out the iron colour to make colourless glass. For instance, glass made from beech wood grown on meagre lime-rich soil (e.g. Kleinlutzel, Jura) is high in manganese and thus, nearly colourless while that in a clay-rich area (e.g. Court-Chalvet, Jura) is olive green. Thus, a variety of colours may be produced and experimentation allowed the glassmakers to progress from the early muddy green-yellow-brown colours toward clear-coloured and colourless glass. Local conditions allowed some areas to produce finer glass at an earlier stage. In Bohemia {{at the end of the}} sixteenth century the decolourising powers of manganese were used to produce a clear glass suitable for engraving. The amount of carbon left in the wood ash also may affect the colour of the glass by modifying the <b>furnace</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> The glass in York Minster has been shown to be 90% naturally coloured, without added colorants.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>furnace</b> <b>atmosphere</b> on E-glass foaming {{has been studied}} with the {{specific}} goal of understanding the impact of increased water content on foaming in oxy-fired furnaces. E-glass foams were generated in a fused-quartz crucible located in a quartz window furnace equipped with video recording. The present study showed that humidity in the <b>furnace</b> <b>atmosphere</b> destabilizes foam, while other gases have little effect on foam stability. These findings do not contradict the generally accepted “dilution model”, suggesting that foaming is more severe in oxy-fired furnaces than in air-fired furnaces because the higher concentration {{of water in the}} <b>furnace</b> <b>atmosphere</b> ultimately enhances sulfate decomposition resulting in stronger foaming. The failure to reproduce this effect in laboratory experiments may be attributed to water incorporation into the glass melt occurring during ablation melting in industrial furnaces...|$|E

25|$|Thermocouples {{are often}} used at high {{temperatures}} and in reactive <b>furnace</b> <b>atmospheres.</b> In this case, the practical lifetime is limited by thermocouple aging. The thermoelectric coefficients of the wires in a thermocouple {{that is used to}} measure very high temperatures may change with time, and the measurement voltage accordingly drops. The simple relationship between the temperature difference of the junctions and the measurement voltage is only correct if each wire is homogeneous (uniform in composition). As thermocouples age in a process, their conductors can lose homogeneity due to chemical and metallurgical changes caused by extreme or prolonged exposure to high temperatures. If the aged section of the thermocouple circuit is exposed to a temperature gradient, the measured voltage will differ, resulting in error.|$|R

The coatings are applied using High Velocity Oxy-Fuel (HVOF) thermal spray techniques. Bulk Fe 3 Al coatings are known to exhibit excellent oxidation and sulfidation resistance at high temperatures, however, the behavior of HVOF-deposited Fe 3 Al coatings has not been documented. HVOF thermal spray deposition was used to produce freestanding Fe 3 Al coatings for high temperature corrosion and oxidation studies. The free standing coatings were then subjected to temperatures up to 1000 o C in various <b>furnace</b> <b>atmospheres</b> during exposure tests exceeding 1000 hours. The <b>furnace</b> <b>atmospheres</b> explored included, dry air, wet air, oxidizing (various ratios of CO 2 :CO), carburizing (CO 2, CO, CH 4 mixtures) and a simulated fossil fuel combustion atmosphere (N 2 - 15 CO 2 - 5 O 2 - 1 SO 2 - 20 H 2 O, in volume percent). The mass gain was monitored as a function time from which the parabolic rate constant for oxidation of the coating was determined. Free-standing, HVOF Fe 3 Al samples exhibited limited corrosion at the sample surface while Inconel Alloy 600 samples experienced greater mass gain with significant oxidation at the sample surface and internal oxidation during oxidation experiments in air at 1000 o C. Fully dense Fe 3 Al coatings exhibited parabolic rate constants for oxidation {{comparable to those of}} bulk Fe 3 Al reported in literature. However, HVOF Fe 3 Al coatings with open porosity exhibited breakaway corrosion after relatively short exposure times (a few hundred hours).

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{prediction}} of gas evolution from a glass melt during fining processes has been described. This procedure {{is based on the}} assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium conditions between the species in the glass melt and co-existing gas phases. The method has been applied to estimate (a) the onset temperature of fining and (b) the evolution of different gases from glass melts. Both are strongly dependent on water concentration in the melt, the temperature, and the content of fining agent (sulfates). Expressions for foam bubble lifetimes have been presented, and a combination of these equations with gas evolution rates has been used in a foam formation model. This model calculates the number of bubble layers on top of glass melts during secondary foaming (foam formation during fining). A key parameter for foam stability and the foam layer thickness is the mobility of the surfaces of the lamellae of the bubbles in the foam layers. The water content in the melt, sulfate concentration levels, heating rates, <b>furnace</b> <b>atmospheres,</b> and bubble sizes govern the glass melt foaming behavior...|$|R

The mechanisms of the different stages of sulfate chemistry in the batch and sulfate fining process are presented, depending on the level of addition of cokes in the batch. The fining gas release as function of temperature from batch and melt are shown for different soda-lime-silica glass forming raw material batches. In case of coke and sulfate containing batches, sulfur dioxide gas release takes place in steps and at different temperature levels. SO 2 may evolve from the batch blanket (at about 900 Â°C), but also at higher temperatures from the fresh melt starting at about 1050 Â°C up to 1250 Â°C, some SO 2 release can take place up to 1350 Â°C and then for oxidized melts a strong evolution between 1420 and 1500 Â°C. The last stage of SO 2 evolution from the melt is generally accompanied with oxygen gas formation as well. Bubble growth rates during primary fining a float glass melts from experiments and models are compared and the removal of dissolved gases from such melts will be shown. The paper shows that <b>furnace</b> <b>atmosphere</b> may have an important influence on the temperature of fining gas evolution and total fining gas production: water vapor or helium in the atmosphere will reduce fining onset temperature and may significantly increase gas evolution during primary fining...|$|E

In photovoltaics in particular annealed Si-C thin films containing Si quantum dots are used to develop solar cells with improved efficiency. The oxidation of these films during the annealing step, which is unavoidable in the high-throughput processes required for photovoltaics, was explored using scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. SiO 2 surface layers 5 to 14 nm thick were observed even in nominally inert <b>furnace</b> <b>atmospheres,</b> while annealing with graphitic carriers leads to the formation of SiOxCy films a few nm thick. To avoid the formation of either compound and thereby reduce the impact of the particular furnace used on the Si-C film an encapsulation layer made of a-Si: H was developed. It is shown that 40 nm of this layer can protect an Si-C film from oxidation. The SiO 2 and residual Si formed are removed using standard etchants with only minimal impact on the Si-C film. It was found that this process depends critically on the thickness of a-Si: H deposited but is fairly insensitive to the parameters of the etching process.

40|$|In recent years, {{growing demand}} for greater {{mechanical}} properties of PM steel components with competitive fabrication cost has led to enormous innovation in different aspects of PM industry. Recent {{research has focused on}} introducing new alloying systems, different <b>furnace</b> <b>atmospheres</b> and combining sintering and post sintering processes for more hardenable powder metallurgy (PM) steels. By elimination of any secondary operation such as quench-hardening and instead by introducing the hardening treatment right after sintering, fabrication cost is reduced by far. Sinter-hardening is a result of research conducted along this line. In this process, it is possible to manufacture sintered parts with a martensitic-bainitic microstructure by applying sufficient cooling rates (1 - 10 °C/s depending on composition) directly after sintering. In addition, alloying elements such as Cr, Mo and Mn are usually added to the Fe-based powder to enhance the hardenability of the material. In this thesis, the cooling response of prealloyed steel powder during the sinter-hardening process has been investigated by means of Finite Element Method (FEM). An axi-symmetric FE model has been developed using MATLAB to predict the cooling response, considering the effects of nonlinear boundary conditions, latent heat of phase transformation and nonlinear thermal properties.
