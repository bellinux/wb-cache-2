40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Washington State UniversityThis {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} four papers analyzing export price formation of U. S. hops, consumers' willingness to pay for sensory attributes in beer, beer extrinsic attributes that affect consumers' choice of beer, {{and the impact of}} <b>hop</b> <b>quality</b> on WTP. The first article analyzes the hop prices formation of U. S. hop exports. The U. S. plays a vital role in domestic and international trade of hops. It was the second largest producer of hops with 29. 7 % share of the world market in 2010. Given that hops are a primary ingredient in a favorite beverage of consumers across the world - beer, it is surprising to observe that the topic has not received nearly any attention in the economic literature. This study examines the export price formation of U. S. hops. An inverse demand system is used to test the above question. The important finding of the analysis {{is that there is a}} negative relationship between quantities of hop exports and prices to Brazil, Canada, Germany, and rest of the world. Due to Germany's large share in the world hop production, the country had the highest own-quantity flexibility among individual countries. The cross-quantity flexibilities between Brazil and Canada and between Germany and rest of the world indicating the substitutability of the U. S. hops for exporting countries. The second study examines consumers' willingness to pay for sensory attributes in beer. As microbrew beers have become more popular, the intrinsic characteristics of beer have become more important in consumer purchasing decisions. We identify sensory properties that influence consumers' willingness to pay for beer using a contingent valuation model that includes subjective sensory evaluations and socio-demographic characteristics of consumers. We find that overall taste and hoppiness of a beer have a significant and positive impact on willingness to pay. The third study examines extrinsic characteristics that effect consumers' consumption choice for beer. Consumers choose a beer based on extrinsic, intrinsic, and socio-demographic characteristics. They form quality expectations after the actual consumption of a beer. Although the intrinsic characteristics influence the repeat purchase decisions consumers make their initial consumption choice based on extrinsic characteristics. The objective of this study is to identify the factors that influence consumers' choice of beer. A conjoint analysis is performed using style, price, alcohol content, and place of origin as factors with various attributes. We find that while pale ale and stout styles, the local and PNW origin attributes increase the probability of choosing the beer there is negative relationship between prices and consumer's choice. The fourth article examines the effect of nitrogen fertilizer treatment of perceived hoppiness and its effect on willingness to pay for beer. The beer market, being the biggest alcoholic market in the U. S., has seen substantial market structure changes in recent years. Craft beers attract more and more consumers with various sensory attributes such as taste/flavor, hoppiness, aroma, and appearance that are valued by consumers. Hoppiness or perceived <b>hop</b> <b>quality</b> is one of the main attributes that microbrewers alter to differentiate their products in the marketplace. In this study we analyze the impact of different fertilizer treatments on perceived <b>hop</b> <b>quality,</b> identify sensory attributes and socio-demographic characteristics that impact consumers' willingness to pay for beer using contingent valuation analysis. The results indicate that consumer could identify the different fertilizer treatments and, thus, sufficient fertilizer is required to get satisfactory hoppiness that consumers are will to pay for.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we propose}} {{a suite of}} schemes for {{wireless}} multiuser relay networks, where multiple source nodes (SNs) and relay nodes (RNs) share the spectral resources and hence we take into the account the co-channel interference (CCI). Our objective is to deal with both the channel fading and CCI {{in order to improve}} the attainable outage performance. Firstly, we consider the opportunistic relay selection (ORS) design in the scenario, where multiple RNs are available for assisting the transmission of a single SN, while CCI is imposed by other SNs in the network. We design the single-user-detection-aided (SUD-aided) and multi-user-detection based successive interference-cancellation-aided (MUD-SIC-aided) systems, where multiple-user detection (MUD) receivers using successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the destination node (DN) are adopted to combat co-channel interference. In SUD-aided system, we employ single-user detection (SUD) at the RNs and MUD SIC at the DN. In MUD-SIC-aided system, we employ MUD-SIC at both the RNs and DN. We present the outage analysis of both systems based on an outage-optimised ORS scheme, implying that the proposed ORS scheme provides the best outage performance. We show that the traditional ORS scheme proposed for SUD receivers based on the highest SNR criterion is not outage-optimal, when employing MUD-SIC in the presence of CCI. Hence, we propose a novel ORS scheme based on a best-effort detection (BED) criterion that outperforms the traditional ORS scheme. Furthermore, considering the effects of the outdated channel state information (CSI), an improved BED-ORS is proposed for enhancing the robustness towards CSI imperfections. Then, we study the scenario, where multiple SNs are coordinated to share a RN. In this case, network coding (NC) may be invoked at the RN, which treats the CCI from other SNs as useful messages and superimposes them to reduce the time slots required for relaying, therefore achieving higher spectral efficiency. However, NC systems may not always be beneficial in cooperative communications, where the detrimental interference of the undesired SNs, often referred to as network coding noise (NC noise), may outweigh the benefits of NC. In previous works, the outage performance was only evaluated numerically for several case studies. Against this background, we propose a systematically analytical framework for evaluating the outage performance for a multi-unicast NC-aided network, where each DN extracts the information of the desired SN from the NC signal forwarded by the RN. As our main contribution, we present the outage analysis of this system in the presence of NC noise and the closed-form analytical outage probability expressions are derived for an arbitrary number of SN-DN pairs. We show that if NC is employed, the quality of the worst SN-DN link may dominate the outage performance of every SNs. We then consider a two-hop network, where multiple SNs transmit to a DN {{with the aid of a}} RN and we assume the direct link between the SNs and the DN is weak. In this scenario, we show that the NC-aided relaying is not preferred and hence the buffer-aided relaying (BAR) is advocated for improving the uplink. The RN is equipped with a buffer, which is capable of storing multiple frames received from the SNs. During each time slot, the proposed protocol activates either the SNRN hop or the RN-DN hop, depending on the channel quality of each hop and the buffer state at the RN. In order to optimise the hop selection for the network, we design a <b>hop</b> <b>quality</b> metric (HQM) and propose a multi-user buffer-aided-relaying uplink (MU-BR-UL) protocol. The benefits of the proposed protocol is analysed in terms of the end-to-end outage probability and the end-to-end transmission delay. Then, the optimal power allocation is proposed for minimizing the end-to-end outage probability under the total power constraint. Furthermore, the impact of the buffer size, the number of users and the relay position on the achievable outage performance are characterized. The results indicate that the outage performance is significantly improved when theproposed power allocation is utilized in the MU-BR-UL protocol. Finally, we consider a new family of networks, in which the SNs and RNs have energy harvesting (EH) capability, which allows the nodes to harvest energy from the environments and convert it to electrical energy for wireless transmissions. The EH removes the constraints of relying on a battery for constant power supply, but also demands novel energy usage policy (EUP) design for effectively utilizing the random power supply gleaned from the EH system. We start with the point-to-point (P 2 P) network and by effectively exploiting the statistics of the energy arrival rates, we propose novel search algorithms for designing the EUP, which achieve a significantly better outage performance than the state-of-the-art designs reported in the literature. Based on the proposed methods in P 2 P network, we design novel EUPs for spacedivision- multiple-access (SDMA) and SDMA-based relay sharing networks. We show that the proposed EUPs significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of outage performance. <br/...|$|E

Changes in the chemical composition of hops during plant maturation are a dynamic process requiring a comprehensive, in-depth chemical and sensory analysis in order to maximize the characteristics of interest to brewers. The complex aroma chemistry associated with hops in beer has been a confounding variable for the practical brewer, and a deeper understanding of hop aroma development during cultivation is needed. The effect of harvest date, location, and cultivar on key chemical components of Willamette and Cascade hops was investigated for the 2010 and 2011 growing seasons. Hops were harvested at 3 time points (Early, Typical, and Late), within a 3 -week interval from 2 different farms in the Willamette Valley, Oregon. A split-plot experimental design for each cultivar was used; each farm represented a main plot and harvest years were designated as subplots. American Society of Brewing Chemist standard methods of analysis were used to measure moisture content, hop acids and their homologs, Hop Storage Index, total essential oil content and volatile profile by GC-FID. Additionally, difference testing, descriptive analysis, and consumer acceptance testing was conducted using beers brewed with either Typical or Late harvested Cascade hops from the 2010 harvest year. The response of analytes was dependent on the cultivar being examined, its location within the Willamette Valley, as well as days until harvest. Hop acids did not change appreciably during plant maturation for the period examined, while hop oil content increased hyperbolically to a plateau as the hops aged on the bine. Increases in oil quantity were strongly correlated (r > 0. 90) with increases in α-pinene, β-pinene, myrcene, limonene, methyl heptanoate, and linalool concentrations. For Cascade, α-pinene, β-pinene, myrcene, limonene, ρ-cymene, caryophyllene, E, β-farnesene, and humulene all increased from Early to Typical points but no increase was observed between the Typical and Late time point. Linalool and methyl heptanoate increased between each time point while citral and humulene epoxide differed between Early harvest and Late harvest, but not between Early and Typical or Late and Typical harvests. For Willamette hops, α-pinene, β-pinene, myrcene, limonene, ρ-cymene, and linalool all increased between each time point. Caryophyllene, E β-farnesene, humulene, farnesol and citral all increased from Early harvest to Typical harvest but no difference was observed between Typical and Late.

Besides, this paper also briefly introduce two other quality of service routing algorithms: predictive location-based routing and ticket-based probing aiming to provide more knowledge about implementing quality of service routing in ad hoc networks. ...|$|R

30|$|One {{possibility}} {{to deal with}} erroneous decoding at the relays is to adaptively select only those relays to forward to the destination which have decoded correctly [7]. However, since erroneous relays may still contribute to the transmission, {{it does not seem}} reasonable to discard erroneously decoded messages. Instead, all relays should forward to the destination and the detector should handle the correct as well as the erroneous messages properly. In [13] a detector for uncoded DF was presented which applies a weighting of the relay messages according to the reliability of the whole source-relay-destination link. For that, all S-R-D links were modeled by equivalent Gaussian channels whose SNRs are dependent on the bit error probabilities on both hops. The messages over different S-R-D links were then weighted according to the respective equivalent SNR and finally combined. In [14, 15] distributed turbo codes in DF systems were investigated. In these studies, the first hop transmission was modeled using a Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC) with a crossover probability dependent on the first <b>hop</b> transmission <b>quality,</b> i.e., the bit error probability at the relay. The BSC model was then used in order to weight the exchanged information between the two constituent decoders at the destination. In [16] we presented a modified detection strategy for dIDM-STC, adopting the ideas from [13, 14] and incorporating the decoding reliability of the relays into the detection at the destination. This was achieved by estimating the decoding reliabilities at the relays and signaling this information to the destination. The reliability information of all relays was then used for a weighted combining of the relay messages. As a result, a significant performance improvement was achieved compared to the common detection scheme for dIDM-STC from [12]. However, it could also be seen that the actual usage of the available information at the destination was not yet optimal as the results indicated a performance gap compared to adaptive relaying schemes in which only correct relays forward to the destination.|$|R

This suggests that deficit irrigating native spearmint might enhance oil accumulation. This is further supported by the observed increase in oil concentration as water stress increased. A number of mint production costs were affected by the reduction in applied water thus reducing the total mint production costs. Since oil yields were similar across treatments, revenues were not significantly affected. This resulted into increase in net farm income. Also, water stress improved the water use efficiency in native spearmint. Hop results showed that the dried hop cone yield decreased with increasing water stress in all the cultivars. The <b>hop</b> cone <b>quality</b> however did not change significantly across treatments. In the full year of production, water stress improved water use efficiency in hop production across all the cultivars. In the Yakima Valley, reduction in amount of water applied only affects the cost of pumping of the irrigation water which is minimal when compared to the total cost of producing hops. The yield reductions due to applying less water to hops caused reductions in revenues that were higher than the savings in the cost of producing hops due to pumping less water. This decreased the net farm income. The study observed how the subsurface drip irrigation system coupled with scientific irrigation scheduling can substantially reduce hop water use. This study also provides production functions for irrigation optimization of native spearmint and four hop cultivars. Department of Biological Systems Engineering, Washington State Universit...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} locally sourced hops from Northeastern microbreweries began the recent {{resurgence}} in local hop production. The farming community has increased acreage and improved the <b>quality</b> of <b>hops</b> grown and processed in the Northeast region {{over the past}} five years. There was a sharp {{increase in the number of}} Northeast hop producers from six in 2009 to over 175 in 2014. Hop growers in the Northeast are new to the crop and have limited experience with pest identification and management. This dissertation encompasses three research projects that were conducted over the 2012 - 2014 growing seasons. These projects were the first critical steps taken to develop arthropod integrated pest management (IPM) tactics for Northeastern hop growers. First, the arthropod community in seven Vermont hop yards was evaluated. The objectives of Chapter 2 are to 1) present current hop pest biology and management strategies, 2) report the phenology of arthropod pests observed over three growing seasons, 3) report abundance and peak date for each pest, and 4) document natural enemy abundance in Vermont hop yards. The survey indicates that in cool, wet seasons hop aphid (Phorodon humuli Schrank) is expected to be a pest of concern. Two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae Koch) is expected to be a pest of concern in hot, dry conditions. Potato leafhopper (Empoasca fabae Harris) is an unpredictable pest of special concern for first year hop plants. When hop aphid or potato leafhopper are sprayed for with broad-spectrum insecticide, two-spotted spider mite secondary outbreak can be expected. Second, the abundance of major arthropod pests and their natural enemy groups were evaluated under drive row flowering cover crop treatments. The objectives of this study were to 1) measure the effect of cover crops on natural enemy group abundance, 2) measure the effect of cover crops on the three major Northeastern hop pests, and 3) measure the effect of cover crop presence on <b>hop</b> yield and <b>quality.</b> Natural enemy groups and pests were positively correlated yet cover crop treatments had no significant effect on natural enemy abundance. Red clover cover crop treatments served as a trap crop for potato leafhopper. No significant difference in <b>hop</b> yield or <b>quality</b> was observed between flowering cover crop treatments. Finally, potato leafhopper is a documented but understudied regional pest of hops. The objectives of this study were to 1) measure the physiological response of eight hop cultivars to adult potato leafhopper feeding and 2) measure hop leaf recovery from potato leafhopper injury. Gas exchange (net photosynthesis and transpiration) and chlorophyll content were measured to quantify injury by adult potato leafhopper to first year hop leaves in field and greenhouse studies. Cultivars did not vary significantly in their physiological response to potato leafhopper feeding. Injury significantly reduced gas exchange measures in the field (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) and greenhouse (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) and when leafhoppers were removed, gas exchange was restored...|$|R

The published article is copyrighted by the American Society of Brewing Chemists {{and can be found}} at: [URL] expertise is required to grow high-quality hops, and brewers and hop growers alike have a common goal of obtaining the highest <b>quality</b> <b>hops</b> possible. Change in the chemical composition of hops during plant maturation is a dynamic process requiring a comprehensive chemical and sensory analysis in order to maximize the characteristics of interest to brewers. The effect of harvest date, location, and cultivar on key chemical components of Willamette and Cascade hops was investigated for the 2010 and 2011 growing seasons. Hops were harvested at 3 time points (Early, Typical, and Late), within a 3 -week interval from 2 different farms in the Willamette Valley, Oregon. A split-plot experimental design for each cultivar was used; each farm represented a main plot and harvest years were designated as subplots. American Society of Brewing Chemist standard methods of analysis were used to measure moisture content, hop acids and their homologs, hop storage index, total essential oil content and volatile profile by GC-FID. Additionally, difference testing, descriptive analysis, and consumer acceptance testing was conducted using beers brewed with either Typical or Late harvested Cascade hops from the 2010 harvest year. The response of analytes was dependent on the cultivar being examined, its location within the Willamette Valley, as well as timing of harvest. Hop acids did not change appreciably during plant maturation for the period examined, while hop oil content increased. Increases in oil quantity were strongly correlated (r > 0. 90) with increases in α-pinene, β-pinene, myrcene, limonene, methyl heptanoate, and linalool concentrations. Clear sensory differences were found between beers brewed with Typical and Late harvested Cascade hops using triangle testing, consumer preference testing, and descriptive analysis...|$|R
40|$|To date, {{research}} on entangled quantum networks has primarily focused on an abstract model {{consisting of a}} linear chain of repeaters, with a power of two number of hops of identical length and quality. We are analyzing the behavior of more complex network topologies. In a network of heterogeneous links and irregular topology, path selection affects both the performance of individual connection and global network load. We propose a definition for link cost and an algorithm for ranking candidate paths to maximize the throughput of end-to-end connections, measured in high-fidelity Bell pairs per second. Simulations confirm reasonable agreement between the calculated path cost and the expected throughput. Thus, we propose {{the use of a}} quantum form of Dijkstra’s algorithm[1]. Problem Networks of quantum repeaters use purification and entanglement swapping to create high-fidelity end-to-end Bell pairs which are then used in distributed quan-tum applications. For homogeneous paths of 2 n hops quantum repeaters operate well using a simple dou-bling of distance for each entanglement swap. In real-world networks, candidate paths will have differing numbers of <b>hops</b> of varying <b>quality.</b> On such hetero-geneous paths, we must reconsider when and where entanglement swapping takes place, and devise an al-gorithm for ranking paths. Approach We wish to define a cost for each path, allowing us to order a set of paths so that low-cost paths better meet out goals for the overall system. Here, we choose max-imizing throughput as our goal, meaning that high-bandwidth paths (measured in high-fidelity Bell pairs per second) will have a low cost. To achieve this, we need both a way to establish the cost for a single link, and a way to calculate path cost from a set of link costs. We use the inverse of single-hop throughput as our link cost. Path cost, as in Dijkstra’s algorithm, is the sum of the link costs in the path. We have extended our quantum network simulator to calculate the through-put of end-to-end connections for heterogeneous links. Non-power of two lengths and path-adapted entangle-ment swapping remain as future work. We expect to use both static and dynamically adaptive methods. Results In our simulation, we used three types of qubus-based repeater links (see [2] and references therein) ...|$|R
