5|$|Motions of a bike can {{be roughly}} grouped into those {{out of the}} central plane of symmetry: lateral; {{and those in the}} central plane of symmetry: {{longitudinal}} or vertical. Lateral motions include balancing, leaning, steering, and turning. Motions in the central plane of symmetry include rolling forward, of course, but also stoppies, wheelies, brake diving, and most suspension activation. Motions in these two groups are linearly decoupled, that <b>is</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not interact with each other to the first order. An uncontrolled bike is laterally unstable when stationary and can be laterally self-stable when moving under the right conditions or when controlled by a rider. Conversely, a bike is longitudinally stable when stationary and can be longitudinally unstable when undergoing sufficient acceleration or deceleration.|$|E
5|$|Some ignorant clerics reject {{calculations}} {{of this kind}} (for shame!) and {{do not wish to}} keep their phylacteries, that <b>is,</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not preserve the order, which they have received in the bosom of mother church, nor do they persist in the holy teaching of meditation. They should consider carefully the way of the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and they should spit out their doctrine like filth. A cleric ought to be the keeper of his own soul, just as a noble man subjects a young foal to the yoke, so he ought to subject his own soul to service, by filling the alabaster box with precious oil, that is, he ought to be inwardly subjected daily, by obeying the divine laws and admonitions of the Redeemer.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} magical powers and {{abilities}} have been showcased in Coven. Some abilities are inherent or reflexive to certain witches, that <b>is</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> {{not need to}} focus or concentrate. It is not rare for a witch to manifest more than three powers, though a Supreme is required {{to have at least}} seven (the Seven Wonders), though not necessarily all possible powers. It is said that the reason that a Supreme is so powerful is because she is the physical embodiment of many and or all powers. Witches are shown {{to be able to use}} their powers collectively. Certain abilities can also be triggered by certain events and substances. Voodoo and witchcraft practitioners share certain powers.|$|E
25|$|As of 2012, {{there are}} 118 known elements, about 80 {{of which are}} stable – that <b>is,</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not change by {{radioactive}} decay into other elements. Some elements can occur {{as more than a}} single chemical substance (allotropes). For instance, oxygen exists as both diatomic oxygen (O2) and ozone (O3). The majority of elements are classified as metals. These are elements with a characteristic lustre such as iron, copper, and gold. Metals typically conduct electricity and heat well, and they are malleable and ductile. Around a dozen elements, such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, are classified as non-metals. Non-metals lack the metallic properties described above, they also have a high electronegativity and a tendency to form negative ions. Certain elements such as silicon sometimes resemble metals and sometimes resemble non-metals, and are known as metalloids.|$|E
500|$|In a major address, Grant stated: [...] "The {{building}} of rail-roads and the access thereby given {{to all the}} agricultural and mineral {{regions of the country}} is rapidly bringing civilized settlements into contact with all the tribes of indians. No matter what ought to be the relations between such settlements and the aborigines, the fact <b>is</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not get on together, and one or the other has to give way in the end. A system which looks to the extinction of a race is too abhorant for a Nation to indulge in without without entailing upon the wrath of all Christendom, and without engendering in the Citizen a disregard for human life, and the rights of others, dangerous to society. I see no remedy for this except in placing all the indians on large reservations...and giving them absolute protection there." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{subjects}} {{almost always}} provide informed consent {{for their participation}} in an RCT, studies since 1982 have documented that RCT subjects may {{believe that they are}} certain to receive treatment that is best for them personally; that <b>is,</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not understand the difference between research and treatment.

2500|$|These {{clusters}} {{are considered}} [...] "electron-deficient," [...] that <b>is,</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> {{not follow the}} octet rule because the molecules lack sufficient electrons to form four 2-centered, 2-electron bonds around each carbon atom, in contrast to most organic compounds. The hexamer is a 30 electron compound (30 valence electrons.) If one allocates 18 electrons for the strong C-H bonds, 12 electrons remain for Li-C and Li-Li bonding. There are six electrons for six metal-metal bonds and one electron per methyl-η3 lithium interaction.|$|E
2500|$|Although laws {{surrounding}} {{sexual harassment}} exist, they {{generally do not}} prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or minor isolated incidents—that <b>is,</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not impose a [...] "general civility code". In the workplace, harassment may be considered illegal when it is so frequent or severe that it creates a hostile or offensive work environment or when it results in an adverse employment decision (such as the victim being fired or demoted, or the victim quitting the job). The legal and social understanding of sexual harassment, however, varies by culture.|$|E

2500|$|Glass lenses {{were never}} {{comfortable}} enough to gain widespread popularity. The first lenses to do so were those made from polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA or Perspex/Plexiglas), now {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "hard" [...] lenses. Their main disadvantage <b>is</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not allow oxygen to pass through to the cornea, which can cause a number of adverse and often serious clinical events. Starting in the late 1970s, improved rigid materials which were oxygen-permeable were developed. Contact lenses made from these materials are called rigid gas permeable lenses or 'RGPs'.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{while this}} is fine for initialisms such as ktp [...] for etc., it can be {{problematic}} when spelling out names. For example, several consonantal distinctions are difficult for many nationalities, who normally rely {{on the fact that}} Esperanto seldom uses these sounds to distinguish words (that <b>is,</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not form many minimal pairs). Thus the pairs of letter names ĵo–ĝo, ĥo–ho (or ĥo–ko), co–ĉo (or co–so, co–to), lo–ro, and ŭo–vo (or vo–bo) are problematic. In addition, over a noisy telephone connection it quickly becomes apparent that voicing distinctions can be difficult to make out: noise confounds the pairs po–bo, to–do, ĉo–ĝo, ko–go, fo–vo, so–zo, ŝo–ĵo, as well as the nasals mo–no.|$|E
2500|$|There exist slight {{variations}} on the above categorisation. Some claim that theological determinism requires predestination of all events and outcomes by the divinity (that <b>is,</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not classify the weaker version as 'theological determinism' unless libertarian free will {{is assumed to be}} denied as a consequence), or that the weaker version does not constitute 'theological determinism' at all. Theological determinism can also be seen as a form of causal determinism, in which the antecedent conditions are the nature and will of God. With respect to free will and the classification of theological compatibilism/incompatibilism below, [...] "theological determinism is the thesis that God exists and has infallible knowledge of all true propositions including propositions about our future actions," [...] more minimal criteria designed to encapsulate all forms of theological determinism.|$|E

2500|$|These {{deal with}} Buddhist wisdom (prajñā). [...] "Wisdom" [...] {{in this context}} means {{the ability to see}} reality as it truly <b>is.</b> <b>They</b> <b>do</b> not contain an {{elaborate}} philosophical argument, but simply try to point to the true nature of reality, especially through the use of paradox. The basic premise is a radical non-dualism, in which every and any dichotomist way of seeing things is denied: so phenomena are neither existent, nor non-existent, but are marked by emptiness (śūnyatā), an absence of any essential, unchanging nature. The Perfection of Wisdom in One Letter illustrates this approach by choosing to represent the perfection of wisdom with the Sanskrit and Pāli short a or [...] "schwa" [...] vowel ("अ", [...] ). As a prefix, this negates a word's meaning, e.g., changing [...] "svabhāva", [...] "with essence" [...] to [...] "asvabhāva", [...] "without essence". It is the first letter of Indic alphabets and, as a sound on its own, {{can be seen as the}} most neutral and basic of speech sounds.|$|E

2500|$|After a tackle, a ruck will {{sometimes}} form. This occurs when {{at least one}} player from each side bind onto each other with {{the ball on the}} ground between them. Additional players may join the ruck, but must do so from behind the rearmost foot of the hindmost team mate in the ruck (often referred to as [...] "coming through the gate") and bind onto the body of a team mate. The offside line for uninvolved players is perpendicular to the last feet of the rearmost player on their side of the ruck and they must remain behind this line until the ball emerges. In a ruck, no player may use their hands to win the ball, except if they were on their feet and had their hands on the ball before the ruck formed. Teams try to win the ball by pushing the opposition off it or by using their feet to [...] "ruck" [...] it to their side. One player (in many cases the scrum-half) directly behind the ruck may reach in and retrieve the ball from the ruck provided they do not participate in the ruck (that <b>is,</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not bind on to an opponent) and stay behind the offside line. [...] A player doing so may not be tackled or grasped by an opponent in the ruck until he or she has played the ball, as this would violate the laws on tackling players without the ball. Players in a ruck must stay on their feet and not deliberately ruck or step on players lying on the ground. Players who are on the ground at a ruck must not impede the ball as it emerges from the ruck. The ruck ends when the ball emerges, a player commits an offence and is penalised or it becomes unplayable and a scrum is awarded. An amendment to the laws on this point is currently being trialled, under which a team which is able to retrieve the ball from the ruck must do so within five seconds. [...] This is to prevent time-wasting; for instance by a team which is leading {{as the end of the}} game approaches.|$|E
