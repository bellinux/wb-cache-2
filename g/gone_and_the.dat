5|$|A {{group of}} abductees meet at Skyland Mountain and are burned alive by more faceless Alien Rebels. Scully and Mulder visit the scene, with Mulder {{continuing}} {{to be very}} skeptical of any alien involvement. The Syndicate is shocked by the massacre. Mulder and Scully visit Cassandra again, who knew {{many of the people}} who died. They encounter Spender, who is upset about their visit with his mother. Krycek is met by Marita. When Krycek returns to the cell where Dmitri is held, he finds him <b>gone,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Well-Manicured Man there instead.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} on the {{southern}} side of the Shangani was over, Forbes and his column conducted a cursory search for survivors from Wilson's party, but, unable to cross the river, could see nothing {{to tell them what}} had happened. Guessing (correctly) that all Company men beyond the river had been killed, they turned and trekked back to Bulawayo in miserable fashion, their supplies all but <b>gone</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Matabele impeding their progress at every turn.|$|E
50|$|Most {{types of}} verbs can appear in finite or non-finite form (and {{sometimes}} these forms may be identical): for example, the English verb go has the finite forms <b>go,</b> <b>goes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>went,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> non-finite forms <b>go,</b> going <b>and</b> <b>gone.</b> <b>The</b> English modal verbs (can, could, will, etc.) are defective and lack non-finite forms.|$|R

5|$|Charles X Gustav {{fell ill}} in early 1660 and died on 23 February of that year. With his death, {{one of the}} major {{obstacles}} to peace was <b>gone</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Treaty of Oliwa was signed on 23 April. Sweden was accepted as sovereign in Swedish Livonia, Brandenburg was accepted as sovereign in Ducal Prussia, and John II Casimir withdrew his claims to the Swedish throne, though he was to retain the title for life. All occupied territories were restored to their pre-war sovereigns.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{returned}} to Hollywood and Graham; Zelda {{returned to}} the hospital. She nonetheless made progress in Asheville, and in March 1940, four years after admittance, she was released. She was nearing forty now, her friends were long <b>gone,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Fitzgeralds no longer had much money. Scott was increasingly embittered by his own failures and his old friend Hemingway's continued success. They wrote each other frequently until Scott's death in December 1940. Zelda was unable to attend his funeral in Rockville, Maryland.|$|E
5|$|Splash dams, greased chutes, {{railroad}} landings, railroad {{branch lines}} and steam donkey operations {{were among the}} strategies utilized to exploit the watershed's resources of timber. Unfortunately, railroad embankments and fills used to build up tributaries had artificially straightened them in the process, and erosion increased dramatically on the barren hillside, causing many streams to become much siltier than they naturally would be. Nearly all the old-growth forest in the watershed is now <b>gone,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> forests that remain are mostly second-growth stands.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the steep}} decline in routes, {{the company was}} reorganized into a virtual airline in 1999. All {{operations}} were {{taken over by the}} Swedish airline Golden Air, who would operate the Saab 340 aircraft. At the same time, Golden Air bought half of Teddy Air. In October, Coast Air announced that they had too few aircraft to continue flying from Stord, and would terminate operations. Teddy Air became the only airline to serve Stord. 1999 returned a loss of NOK6.9 million. In 2004, Teddy Air terminated all services. The contract with Golden Air was discontinued, and the hangar at Geiteryggen was sold. The company remained on paper until 2005, when the equity was <b>gone</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> entity was dissolved.|$|E
5|$|The Museum House is cast in Classical Revival {{style and}} was the last {{outbuilding}} constructed for Isaac Ellwood on the property. Today the Museum House's exterior appears {{much the same as}} it did when it was newly constructed but for many years the structure was badly deteriorated. After Harriet Ellwood died in 1910 the objects remained inside the building while it began to decline. By 1934 the building was in serious need of repair and by the 1970s both porches were <b>gone</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> only way into the building was through the north door. The museum house restoration was undertaken more than ten years later. Prior to the addition of the Visitors Center to the Carriage House, the Museum House served as the visitors center and housed staff offices.|$|E
5|$|The west {{range was}} entirely rebuilt by the Gilmours, in the 1660s, {{to provide a}} spacious suite of modern accommodation, to suit Sir John's {{position}} as a senior judge. The ground floor contained a large central drawing room dining room, with large windows, and a carved stone fireplace. This room would also have had plaster ceilings and other decorative features. To the north was a kitchen, and to the south a chamber, with a wine cellar below. The first floor had four bedrooms. Another new stair was built, connecting the west range with the tower house. The door to this tower has a classical pediment, above which is a 20th-century plaque, erected by a descendant of the Gilmours, and bearing the arms of Sir John Gilmour and his wife. The west range is now roofless, the internal floor is also <b>gone,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> large windows have been blocked up.|$|E

5|$|With Graham <b>gone</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> quarterback {{situation}} in flux, the Browns ended 1956 with a 5–7 record, Paul Brown's first losing {{season as a}} professional coach. In the next year's draft, the team selected Jim Brown out of Syracuse University. As television began to help football leapfrog baseball as America's most popular sport, Jim Brown became a larger-than-life personality. He was handsome and charismatic in private and dominant on the field. Paul Brown, however, was critical of some aspects of Jim Brown's game, including his disinclination to block. In Jim Brown's first season, the team reached the championship game, again against the Lions, but lost 59–14. The Browns did not contend for the championship in the following two years, when a Baltimore Colts team coached by Brown's former protege Weeb Ewbank won a pair of titles.|$|E
5|$|Branches of the Mexican Red Cross in Guerrero, Oaxaca and Michoacán {{were put}} on alert. The organization's {{national}} emergency response team was on stand-by to assist the most affected areas. Navy helicopters delivered food and water to remote areas of the Baja California peninsula. The Mexican Red Cross dispatched 2,000food parcels to {{the southern tip of}} Baja California Sur. In the city of Mulegé, gas supply, which was necessary to run generators, was low, drinking water was <b>gone,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> airstrip was covered with mud. Many homeless residents initially stayed with friends or in government-run shelters. Throughout the Baja California peninsula, thousands remained without water or electricity two days after the storm, although a pilot from Phoenix prepared to fly to the disaster area with 100gallons (380litres) of water. Other pilots were expected to execute similar flights, as well. The office of Baja California Sur Tourism stated that minimal damage occurred to the tourism infrastructure, with only minimal delays to airports, roads, and maritime facilities. The Episcopal Relief and Development delivered food, clothing, medicine, and transportation to about 100families, and gave mattresses to about 80families.|$|E

When the last period began, all hope of conciliating the Protestants was <b>gone</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Jesuits had become a strong force.|$|E
