5|$|At {{the end of}} this week's episode, Rick is of {{the mind}} that they're square; they've got {{everything}} out in the open, they've each said their piece and they both know where each other stands, they've had their big blowout and they're riding back <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>car</b> and Rick thinks he's handled it. He doesn't necessarily think he's got his friend back, but he thinks the matters are settled. From the look of Shane <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>car,</b> I don't know that he's necessarily thinking that. For the most part, this conflict may be put on the back burner for the time being. It definitely seems like Shane still has a bone to pick.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a closeup shot of Katy's face, {{surrounded}} by alternating red and blue lights, as she mouths the song's lyrics. It then changes to a mechanics' shop, where two young men are seen sitting, looking to the ground. Shots of sparks then appear in the screen, which emerge from a car. Katy {{is sitting on the}} automobile's passenger seat, while looking to her love interest, who is repairing the car, seemingly worried. She is later seen being driven by her boyfriend's group <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>car.</b> Her boyfriend is seen lying on a bed, and looking at the mirror, looking distantly. The car seen before finally arrives in a car parking lot where other cars are driving in circles. They exit their cars while others start driving again. The video's final scenes take place at the car parking lot, while the cars keep driving, with shots of women and other men sitting on the cars. The visual finally closes with a similar shot to that seen in the beginning, of Katy's face surrounded by lights, though now, her face is mixed with her love interest's.|$|E

2500|$|Series creators Ashley Pharoah and Matthew Graham have {{confirmed}} that they intended Sam's jump to be suicide. In {{an interview with the}} Manchester Evening News, Graham states that Sam is now in the afterlife, where time lasts an eternity compared to the suicide's duration of a few seconds: [...] "The truth is, when I wrote it, what I was trying to say is that he's died, and that for however long that last second of life is going to be, it will stretch out for an age, as an eternity for him. And so when he drives off <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>car,</b> he's really driving off into the afterlife." ...|$|E

He was a {{handsome}} man, I'd say, {{and he made a}} good appearance and of course he had a reputation for being a killer. So the press all followed Gonzaullas." [...] He also said, [...] "No, he didn't do any real police work himself. He'd get <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>car</b> and ride around, {{ask a lot of questions}} about what the other officers had found then he'd release it to the press like it was his information. It got to where after a while some officers wouldn't tell him anything." ...|$|E
2500|$|Connector cars, {{numbered}} in the 62xx series, were marshalled {{with their}} cabs (which {{were converted to}} vestibules, the windscreens being blanked off) next to the locomotive, {{to which they were}} connected with special control couplings. The purpose of the connector cars was to [...] "convert the signals from the former railcar controls on the control car into a form which can be received and acted upon by the control equipment on the loco." [...] The cars also contained guard's compartments, which retained their heating boilers; however, as noted above, only the boiler in the driving trailer was normally used, whereas the location of the generator set <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>car</b> forced the guard to travel in the (normally unheated) compartment in the connector car.|$|E

2500|$|The band {{released}} several {{songs for}} War Child compilations. In 2002 Elbow recorded {{a cover of}} [...] "Something in the Air" [...] for the compilation 1 Love. Elbow contributed the song [...] "Snowball" [...] to another compilation, , in September 2005. The song was originally recorded for the Cast of Thousands record but omitted from the final album as the band felt it did not fit; the political lyrics suited the Warchild compilation. In 2009 Elbow contributed their cover of U2's [...] "Running to Stand Still" [...] to War Child Presents Heroes. Garvey explained: [...] "When the band first met each other aged 17, Mark and Craig's father Gareth would lend us his Volvo to get our gear around. It seemed that {{for a year and}} a half all that we listened to <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>car</b> was Rattle and Hum. I remember the excitement every time a U2 album was released, we just loved them. The first song we ever covered together before we had enough of our own songs to do a performance was 'Running to Stand Still'. For 'Heroes' we've changed the order of things but kept every musical theme in the song. We wrote it with the members of U2 in mind. War Child do exactly what it says on the tin. These kids shouldn't be in such circumstances in the first place, but they are, so thank god someone's doing something about it".|$|E
2500|$|The Irregulars in the laneway {{opened fire}} with rifles on the convoy. Emmet Dalton ordered {{the driver of}} the touring car to 'drive like hell', but Collins said 'no, stop and we'll fight 'em' and jumped from the vehicle along with the others. Collins first took cover behind the low grass bank {{bordering}} the road but then jumped up and ran back along the road to begin firing with his Lee Enfield rifle from behind the armoured car. The Vickers machine gun <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>car</b> had also been firing at the attackers but then stopped because a badly-loaded ammunition belt caused it to jam. Apparently {{to get a better view}} of the laneway, Collins foolishly left the protection of the armoured car and moved even further back along the road. Now standing in the open, he fired a couple of shots and as he was once more working the bolt of his rifle he was shot in the head. He was the only fatality, although another member of his party suffered a neck wound. At this stage, the firing abated and the Irregulars moved away. Collins was found, face down, on the roadway. One of his men whispered an Act of Contrition into his ear, but Collins was clearly dead. He was lifted into the back of the touring car with his head resting against the shoulder of Emmet Dalton.

60|$|And {{that reminds}} me of a trifle.

Now, isn't that strange? But it's true. The woman who has never swerved from cast-iron veracity and fidelity in her whole life will, when confronted with this crucial test, deny her hair-pin. She will deny that hair-pin before a hundred witnesses. I have stupidly got into more trouble and more hot water trying to hunt up the owner of a hair-pin in a Pullman than by any other indiscretion of my life.|$|E
60|$|When I {{was here}} {{about eight years}} ago I was coming up in a car of the {{elevated}} road. Very few people were <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>car,</b> and on one end of it there was no one, except on the opposite seat, where sat a man about fifty years old, with a most winning face and an elegant eye--a beautiful eye; and I took him from his dress to be a master mechanic, a man who had a vocation. He had with him a very fine little child of about four or five years. I was watching the affection which existed between those two. I judged he was the grandfather, perhaps. It was really a pretty child, and I was admiring her, {{and as soon as he}} saw I was admiring her he began to notice me.|$|E

60|$|Down, down he went. He {{looked at}} his watch; he had been <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>car</b> only {{an hour and a}} half. Was that possible? He had {{supposed}} he was almost at the bottom. Suddenly he thought of the people above, and of the telephone. Why had not some of them spoken to him? It was shameful! He instantly called Bryce, and his heart leaped with joy when he heard the familiar voice in his ear. Now he talked steadily on for more than an hour. He had his gardener called, and he told him all that he wanted done in the flower-beds. He gave many directions in regard to the various operations of the Works. Things had been put back a great deal of late. He hoped soon to have everything going on in the ordinary way. There were two or three inventions in which he took particular interest, and of these he talked at great length with Mr. Bryce. Suddenly, in the midst of some talk about hollow steel rods, he told Bryce to let the engines move faster; there was no reason why the car should go so slowly.|$|E
6000|$|They {{had planned}} to stop over at Rochester till the morrow, that they might arrive at Niagara by daylight, and at Utica they had {{suddenly}} resolved to make {{the rest of the}} day's journey in a drawing-room car. The change gave them an added reason for content; and they realized how much they had previously sacrificed to the idea of travelling in the most American manner, without achieving it after all, for this seemed a touch of Americanism beyond the old-fashioned car. They reclined in luxury upon the easy-cushioned, revolving chairs; they surveyed with infinite satisfaction the elegance of the flying-parlor in which they sat, or turned their contented regard through the broad plate-glass windows upon the landscape without. They said that none but Americans or enchanted princes in the [...] "Arabian Nights" [...] ever travelled in such state; and when the stewards of the car came round successively with tropical fruits, ice-creams, and claret-punches, they felt a heightened assurance that they were either enchanted princes--or Americans. There were more ladies and more fashion than in the other cars; and prettily dressed children played about on the carpet; but the general appearance of the passengers hardly suggested greater wealth than elsewhere; and they were plainly <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>car</b> because they were of the American race, which finds nothing too good for it that its money can buy.|$|E
60|$|From an English {{point of}} view {{there has not been}} the least attempt at grading those hills, and indeed you might as well try to grade the {{hillocks}} of Sind. The cable cars have for all practical purposes made San Francisco a dead level. They take no count of rise or fall, but slide equably on their appointed courses {{from one end to the}} other of a six-mile street. They turn corners almost at right angles, cross other lines, and for aught I know may run up the sides of houses. There is no visible agency of their flight, but once in awhile you shall pass a five-storied building humming with machinery that winds up an everlasting wire cable, and the initiated will tell you that here is the mechanism. I gave up asking questions. If it pleases Providence to make a car run up and down a slit in the ground for many miles, and if for twopence halfpenny I can ride <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>car,</b> why shall I seek the reasons of the miracle? Rather let me look out of the windows till the shops give place to thousands and thousands of little houses made of wood (to imitate stone), each house just big enough for a man and his family. Let me watch the people in the cars and try to find out in what manner they differ from us, their ancestors.|$|E
