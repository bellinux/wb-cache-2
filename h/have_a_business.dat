5|$|The {{charges against}} Galle were dropped before her case went to trial. Mitchell's case was tried by county {{attorney}} Scott Tidwell, a political supporter of Roberts {{and the personal}} attorney for Arafiles, in February 2010. Both the TMB executive director and the county attorney in nearby Andrews County discouraged Tidwell from trying the case. At trial, Mitchell did not testify. The relationship between Arafiles and Roberts was explored during the proceedings. Arafiles introduced Roberts to a supplement-selling program known as Zrii, and recommended the supplements to his patients. Roberts sold the supplements, {{but he said that}} his friendship with Arafiles had not impacted his actions with the nurses and that he did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> relationship with Arafiles.|$|E

500|$|Billingsley's {{original}} {{plan for the}} Cub Room was {{for it to be}} a private place for playing gin rummy with his friends. The room was added to the club during World War II. Billingsley broke out a wall in the bar to create this private space, but it was Walter Winchell who began to call it the Cub Room. The Cub Room had no windows and was described in a Louis Sobol column as a [...] "lopsided oval". The room was lit with pink tones. [...] On the wood-paneled walls were paintings of beautiful women; Billingsley also had similar portraits by the same artist in the ladies' powder room. After the club's labor problems began in 1957, Billingsley redecorated the entire club, choosing emerald green for the carpet and chairs, and a pinkish-red for the banquettes. The Cub Room's wood panels were replaced by beige burlap and the portraits of beautiful women were replaced by paintings of noted 19th-century race horses. As a concession to those who wanted to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> lunch at The Stork, the Cub Room was for men only during lunch time. The sanctum sanctorum, the Cub Room ("the snub room"), was guarded by a captain called [...] "Saint Peter" [...] (for the saint who guards the gates of Heaven).|$|E

2500|$|In the Washington, D.C., office, Giles and O'Keefe {{ask about}} how to account for Giles' {{anticipated}} prostitution income on tax forms. Giles asks, [...] "is there a way I can make up two years of tax returns?" [...] The ACORN employee replies, [...] "no you can't make it up", but tells Giles that she could form a business and state that she provides a service. The employee says, [...] "you can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>business.</b> She's {{not going to put}} down that she's doing prostitution", and [...] "you don't have to sit back and tell people what it is you do." [...] Giles later tells an ACORN employee that she will be giving the money earned from prostitution to O'Keefe. The employee says, [...] "when the police ask you – you don't know where it's coming from." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a March 30, 2010 {{interview}} with Soap Opera Digest, Riegel explained why {{she decided to}} move on from the character: I had {{tried to make it}} work with All My Children. I don’t <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> head, so I don’t really make business decisions; every decision I make in my life is emotional and it was difficult to feel that the show wasn’t... that Bianca was getting lost. That who she was, was getting lost. I went back several times and they were so lovely to let me come back and play a character I love with the people I love so many times. But I felt that the people making the show didn’t really understand what Bianca was about anymore... It troubled me. I got letters from people to whom Bianca meant a great deal essentially saying, [...] "Please don’t come back. We can't take it anymore." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hovind {{established}} Creation Science Evangelism in 1989 to evangelize {{and teach}} creationism. In May 1999, his son Eric joined Creation Science Evangelism as a speaker, {{and his daughter}} Marlissa began training to become Hovind's secretary. That year, CSE merged with Faith Baptist Fellowship of Hawthorne, Florida, beginning a relationship that lasted until 2002. In 2003, {{with the aid of}} Glenn Stoll (a promoter of tax avoidance schemes), Hovind set up a series of entities starting with [...] "an unincorporated association of pure trust" [...] on May 13, under which a corporation sole and several ministerial trusts were established starting on May 23. CSE properties were conveyed to the trusts which operated under business licenses from the [...] "Kingdom of Heaven". Hovind is associated with the Unregistered Baptist Fellowship (UBF), a loosely affiliated group of roughly 100 churches which share a [...] "theology of Christian resistance" [...] to civil governments. Because the UBF would consider it an acknowledgement of government authority over the church, they reject the highly favorable 501(c)3 status, which makes donations tax deductible and exempts them from income tax, but not FICA taxes or employee income tax withholding. The UBF holds that governmental authority stops [...] "at the threshold of the church", and Hovind has likened his ministry's status to that of the Vatican City State. When the federal government obtained a search warrant in 2004, an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) criminal investigator made the sworn statement that the organization did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> license and did not have tax-exempt status.|$|E
