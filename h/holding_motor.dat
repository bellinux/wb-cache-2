40|$|Motor {{impairment}} {{is highly}} prevalent in HIV-infected patients. Here, we assess associations between peripheral muscular deficits as {{evaluated by the}} 5 sit-to-stand test (5 STS) and structural integrity of the motor system at a central level. Eighty-six HIV-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and with no major cerebral events, underwent an MRI scan and the 5 STS. Out of 86 participants, forty presented a score greater than two standard deviations above mean normative scores calculated for the 5 STS and were therefore considered as motor-impaired. MRI-structural cerebral parameters were compared to the unimpaired participants. Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Axial Diffusivity (AD) and Radial Diffusivity (RD), reflecting microstructural integrity, were extracted from Diffusion-Tensor MRI. Global and regional cerebral volumes or thicknesses were extracted from 3 D-T 1 morphological MRI. Whereas the two {{groups did not differ}} for any HIV variables, voxel-wise analysis revealed that motor-impaired participants present low FA values in various cortico-motor tracts and low AD in left cortico-spinal tract. However, they did not present reduced volumes or thicknesses of the precentral cortices compared to unimpaired participants.
