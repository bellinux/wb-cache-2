5|$|Petrodollar {{recycling}} {{is the international}} spending or investment of a country's revenues from petroleum exports ("petrodollars"). It generally refers to the phenomenon of major petroleum-exporting nations, mainly the OPEC members plus Russia and Norway, earning more money from the export of crude oil than they could efficiently invest in their own economies. The resulting global interdependencies and financial flows, from oil producers back to oil consumers, can reach a scale of <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> US dollars per year – including {{a wide range of}} transactions in a variety of currencies, some pegged to the US dollar and some not. These flows are heavily influenced by government-level decisions regarding international investment and aid, with important consequences for both global finance and petroleum politics. The phenomenon is most pronounced during periods when the price of oil is historically high. The first major petrodollar surge (1974–1981) resulted in more financial complications than the second (2005–2014).|$|E

40|$|International audienceTo reduce {{monitoring}} cost, {{the number}} of monitors {{that are to be}} deployed has to be minimized and the overhead of monitoring flows on the underlying network has to be reduced. In a recent work, we demonstrated, using ILP formulations, that there is a trade-off between these two minimization objectives. However, we have shown that the trade-off could be efficiently balanced by optimizing monitor location and anomaly detection costs jointly. The problem is NP-complete, hence ILPs could not deliver solutions for large networks. In this paper, we address the scalability issues. We propose two greedy algorithms that optimize monitor location cost and anomaly detection cost jointly. The first algorithm is based on an exhaustive heuristic that explores all paths that are candidate to be monitored, in order to select a subset of paths that reduces the total monitoring cost. On the opposite, the second algorithm is based on a selective heuristic that avoids exploring all the candidate paths to further improve scalability. The main challenge of this heuristic is to not degrade the solution quality. The two algorithms have been evaluated through extensive simulations on networks <b>of</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> paths. The comparison of the solutions delivered by the two algorithms {{to each other and to}} the solutions delivered by the ILP demonstrates that the selective algorithm provides near-optimal solutions, while achieving a desirable scalability with respect to the network size and significant reduction of the computation time...|$|R

25|$|Circumstellar {{habitable}} zones {{change over}} time with stellar evolution. For example, hot O-type stars, which may remain on the main sequence for fewer than 10 million years, would have rapidly changing habitable zones not conducive {{to the development of}} life. Red dwarf stars, on the other hand, which can live for <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> years on the main sequence, would have planets with ample time for life to develop and evolve. Even while stars are on the main sequence, though, their energy output steadily increases, pushing their habitable zones farther out; our Sun, for example, was 75% as bright in the Archaean as it is now, and in the future, continued increases in energy output will put Earth outside the Sun's habitable zone, even before it reaches the red giant phase. In order to deal with this increase in luminosity, the concept of a continuously habitable zone has been introduced. As the name suggests, the continuously habitable zone is a region around a star in which planetary-mass bodies can sustain liquid water for a given period of time. Like the general circumstellar habitable zone, the continuously habitable zone of a star is divided into a conservative and extended region.|$|E

Finding transitive closures of data records is a preprocessing step of a two-step approach to data quality control, such as data accuracy, redundancy, consistency, currency and completeness. The objective of finding transitive closures {{is to reduce the}} number of records to be considered in the second step, from a whole data source having <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> millions to <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> records to the range <b>of</b> <b>hundreds</b> to thousands. To process <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> millions to <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> records, an efficient approach is essential that works in distributed environment. As a part of this approach, this paper presents an efficient distributed algorithm for solving distributed transitive closure problem on large data sets. Due to huge volumes of data, many real world applications are in need of fast and efficient approaches for data analysis and data mining. However, data cleansing, which precedes data analysis and data mining, is becoming the center of research interest in recent years. As a part of it, the process of finding transitive closures (i. e., finding all related records) is the main goal of this paper.
