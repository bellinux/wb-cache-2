Analysis of data from 1280 12 – 17 -year-old Western Australian metropolitan high school students, found that several factors were associated with adolescent involvement <b>in</b> <b>structured</b> leisure activities, including parent support of the activity (both active and passive), intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy.

5|$|As enzymes {{have evolved}} to bind their {{substrates}} tightly, and most reversible inhibitors bind in the active site of enzymes, it is unsurprising {{that some of these}} inhibitors are strikingly similar <b>in</b> <b>structure</b> to the substrates of their targets. An example of these substrate mimics are the protease inhibitors, a very successful class of antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV. The structure of ritonavir, a protease inhibitor based on a peptide and containing three peptide bonds, is shown on the right. As this drug resembles the protein that is the substrate of the HIV protease, it competes with this substrate in the enzyme's active site.|$|E

5|$|Donkeys, like mules, need less {{protein and}} more fiber than horses. Although the donkey’s {{gastrointestinal}} tract has no marked differences <b>in</b> <b>structure</b> {{to that of}} the horse, donkeys are more efficient at digesting food and thrive on less forage than a similar sized pony. They only need to eat 1.5% of their body weight per day in dry matter.

It is composed of two copies of positive single-stranded RNA that codes for the virus's nine genes enclosed by a conical capsid composed of 2,000 copies of the viral protein p24. The single-stranded RNA is tightly bound to nucleocapsid proteins, p7, and enzymes needed {{for the development of}} the virion such as reverse transcriptase, proteases, ribonuclease and integrase.

The left ear opening is higher on the head than the larger right ear and tilts downward, improving sensitivity to sounds from below. Both ear openings are hidden under the facial disk feathers, which are structurally specialized to be transparent to sound, and are supported by a movable fold of skin (the pre-aural flap).|$|E
