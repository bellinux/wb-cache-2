40|$|Efficient {{execution}} of large-scale application codes {{is a primary}} requirement in many cases. High efficiency can only be achieved by utilizing architecture-independent efficient algorithms and exploiting specific architecture-dependent characteristics of a given computer architecture. However, platform specific versions of source code must be avoided to limit development and maintenance complexity. Usually, the problem can be formulated on an abstract level (mathematical equations, English). At that level, the problem is completely known, {{and there is no}} reference to the hardware on which the problem will be solved. Unfortunately, often the advantages of a high level of abstraction are overshadowed by a loss of performance compared to handwritten code. Therefore, a problem-specific code generator, called Ctadel, has been developed in order to exploit architecture-independent and dependent optimizations. We show how to extend Ctadel with more advanced numerical techniques and a interfaces to numerical libraries. A number of numerical models from Hirlam, a numerical weather prediction application in use by a number of <b>meteorological</b> <b>institutes</b> like the <b>Dutch</b> royal <b>meteorological</b> <b>institute</b> (KNMI) where specified using our specification language. We compared the performance of the generated program code with hand-written code. In most case, the code generated by Ctadel performs as well or even better than the hand-written code. Promotor: H.

40|$|A {{study is}} {{presented}} {{focusing on the}} potential value of parameters derived from radiosonde data or data from numerical atmospheric models for the forecasting of severe weather associated with convective storms. Parameters have been derived from soundings in the proximity of large hail, tornadoes (including tornadoes over water: waterspouts) and thunderstorms in the Netherlands. 66, 365 radiosonde soundings from six stations {{in and around the}} Netherlands between 1 Dec. 1975 to 31 Aug. 2003 were classified as being associated or not associated with these weather phenomena using observational data from voluntary observers, the <b>Dutch</b> National <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Institute</b> (KNMI) and lightning data from the U. K. Met. Office. It was found that instability as measured by the Lifted Index or CAPE and 0 – 6 km wind shear independently have considerable skill in distinguishing environments of large hail and of non-hail-producing thunderstorms. It was also found that CAPE released below 3 km above ground level is on average high near waterspouts and weak tornadoes that mostly occur with low shear in the lowest 1 km above the Earth's surface. On the other hand, low-level shear is strong in environments of stronger (F 1 and F 2) tornadoes and increases with increasing F-scale. This is consistent with the notion that stretching of pre-existing vertical vorticity is the most important mechanism for the formation of weak tornadoes while the tilting of vorticity is more important with stronger tornadoes. The presented results may assist forecasters to assess the likelihood of severe hail or tornadoes...|$|R

50|$|Vening Meinesz then {{designed}} a new gravimeter, which the KNMI (Royal <b>Dutch</b> <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Institute)</b> built. The apparatus has two pendula {{of the same}} size hanging in a frame but moving in opposite phases. With mirrors and lightbeams the difference in amplitude of the two pendula is captured on a film. Vening Meinesz had discovered that horizontal accelerations (as by waves on a boat) had no influence on the difference in amplitude between the two pendula. The recorded difference then is the amplitude of a theoretical, undisturbed pendulum. Now it became possible to measure gravity more accurately. Vening Meinesz started with measuring gravity all over the Netherlands, for which a network of 51 monitoring stations was created. This became a success, which encouraged him to do measurements at sea. A perfected gravimeter, hanging in a 'swing', was designed. The experiment was successful.|$|E
50|$|Punched cards, {{which are}} pieces of stiff paper that contain digital {{information}} {{represented by the}} presence or absence of holes in predefined positions, were a technical marvel when they came into prominence in the United States. The cards, developed by Herman Hollerith for use in the 1890 U.S. Census, made the use of historical weather records a practical means for determining the probability of future weather events and patterns. The British used punched cards successfully in about 1920 to extract wind data from ships’ logs and to produce wind roses for ocean regions. The <b>Dutch</b> <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Institute</b> borrowed some of the British cards in 1922 and began their own weather analyses. Norway, France, and Germany soon followed. Then, in 1927, the Czech meteorologist, L.W. Pollak, placed small and inexpensive punch machines of his own design in every Czech weather station. As each observation was taken, it was punched on a card that was sent to a central tabulating unit for summary and analysis. Although the equipment for gathering and tabulating weather data has changed since then, the basic idea of the process has not.|$|E

30|$|OMI {{can observe}} the Earth’s {{atmosphere}} in three observation modes. In the main mode—called the Global measurement mode—OMI has a swath width of 2600 km, a nadir pixel size of 13 × 48 km 2 (along- × across-track) for the UV 1 channel and 13 × 24 km 2 for the UV 2 and VIS channels. The pixel size {{increases in the}} swath direction for increasing distances from the satellite ground track. The OMI average spectral resolution is of about 0.4 nm in the UV 1 and UV 2 channels and about 0.6 nm in the VIS channel. The OMI Global measurement mode provides almost global coverage in one day. In principle, a complete daily global coverage is possible at midlatitudes.
