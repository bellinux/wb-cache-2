The ices that formed the Jovian planets were more abundant than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial planets, allowing the giant planets to grow massive enough to capture hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant elements. Planetesimals beyond the frost line accumulated up to [...] within about 3million years. Today, the four giant planets comprise just under 99% of all the mass orbiting the Sun. Theorists believe it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>accident</b> <b>that</b> Jupiter lies just beyond the frost line. Because the frost line accumulated large amounts of water via evaporation from infalling icy material, it created a region of lower pressure that increased the speed of orbiting dust particles and halted their motion toward the Sun. In effect, the frost line acted as a barrier that caused material to accumulate rapidly at ~5AU from the Sun. This excess material coalesced into a large embryo (or core) {{on the order of}} , which began to accumulate an envelope via accretion of gas from the surrounding disc at an ever-increasing rate. [...] Once the envelope mass became about equal to the solid core mass, growth proceeded very rapidly, reaching about 150Earth masses ~105years thereafter and finally topping out at [...] [...] Saturn may owe its substantially lower mass simply to having formed a few million years after Jupiter, when there was less gas available to consume.|$|E

2500|$|The {{mechanism}} for the advancing of the stay-at-home twin's clock is gravitational time dilation. When an observer finds that inertially moving objects are being accelerated with respect to themselves, those objects are in a gravitational field insofar as relativity is concerned. For the traveling twin at turnaround, this gravitational field fills the universe. In a weak field approximation, clocks tick {{at a rate of}} [...] where Φ is the difference in gravitational potential. In this case, [...] where g is the acceleration of the traveling observer during turnaround and h is the distance to the stay-at-home twin. The rocket is firing towards the stay-at-home twin, thereby placing that twin at a higher gravitational potential. Due to the large distance between the twins, the stay-at-home twin's clocks will appear to be sped up enough to account for the difference in proper times experienced by the twins. It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>accident</b> <b>that</b> this speed-up is enough to account for the simultaneity shift described above. The general relativity solution for a static homogeneous gravitational field and the special relativity solution for finite acceleration produce identical results.|$|E
2500|$|Nineteenth-century positivist historians {{stressed}} {{what they}} saw as Thucydides's seriousness, his scientific objectivity and his advanced handling of evidence. A virtual cult following developed among such German philosophers as Friedrich Schelling, Friedrich Schlegel and Friedrich Nietzsche, who claimed that, [...] ", the portrayer of man, that culture of the most impartial knowledge of the world finds its last glorious flower." [...] The late-18th-century Swiss historian Johannes von Müller described Thucydides as 'the favourite author of the greatest and noblest men, {{and one of the best}} teachers of the wisdom of human life.' [...] For Eduard Meyer, Macaulay and Leopold von Ranke, who initiated [...] modern source-based history writing, Thucydides was again the model historian.

2500|$|The liberal {{retreat into}} the immanent plenum of sensory {{experience}} (with its related Christology of Christ as purely an outstanding [...] "servant of God"), was as unacceptable as Bultmann's accidental denigration of transcendent Truth into something purely mythical (totally ahistorical). [...] Theologie der Auferstehung was his manifesto on the subject, and he updated it many years later, with {{a chapter on}} eschatology and the aeon of aeons, {{as well as more}} arguments aimed at Bultmann. He also included a new, need discussion on the nature of Time (something Augustine had noted as problematic long ago), in which (predictably) he rejected the dichotomy between eternity and earthly time: [...] "This positing of an exclusive antithesis between time and eternity makes impossible any union of the eternal God with temporal man" [...] (p.182). Theologie der Auferstehung is tightly argued, copiously footnoted, and conceived with vision : it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>accident</b> <b>that</b> he shares an affinity with Eastern theology on this point (regardless of their emphasis on the Incarnation), noting that the Evangelical Churches in Russia have [...] "a profound grasp of the Easter Act of Jesus Christ" [...] (p.19). Moltmann may have emphasized the cross, and the Catholic Church the Incarnation, but it is true to assert that for Künneth, the Resurrection is the Archimedean point of eschatology, the meaning of time, history, miracles, dogma, and all else beside. Anything else, he believes, undercuts the early Christian emphasis on Jesus as the risen Kyrios (Lord), who is [...] "risen indeed!".

The extraction and preparation of this dye were labor-intensive and thus quite costly. It was used for royal garments in many places in the Mediterranean region, and in Israel it was also used for priestly garments and for the cloth furnishings of the Tabernacle. Alter argued that the indigo twist betokened the idea that Israel should become (in the words of [...] ) a [...] "kingdom of priests and a holy nation" [...] and perhaps also that, as the covenanted people, metaphorically God’s firstborn, {{the nation as a whole}} had royal status.

In 1991, John Hayden updated Russell Noyes's 1971 biography of Wordsworth and began his analysis of the ode by claiming: [...] "Wordsworth's great 'Ode on Immortality' is not easy to follow nor wholly clear. A basic difficulty of interpretation centers upon what the poet means by 'immortality.'" [...] However, he goes on to declare, [...] "the majority of competent judges acclaim the 'Ode on Immortality' as Wordsworth's most splendid poem. In no other poem are poetic conditions so perfectly fulfilled. There is the right subject, the right imagery to express it, and the right meter and language for both." [...] Thomas McFarland, when emphasising the use of a river as a standard theme in Wordsworth's poems, stated in 1992: [...] "Not only do Wordsworth's greatest statements--'Tintern Abbey', 'The Immortality Ode', 'The Ruined Cottage', 'Michael', the first two books of The Prelude--all overlie a streaming infrashape, but Wordsworth, like the other Romantics, seemed virtually hypnotized by the idea of running water." [...] After analysing the Wordsworth's incorporation of childhood memories into the ode, G. Kim Blank, in 1995, argued, [...] "It is the recognition and finally the acceptance of his difficult feelings that stand behind and in the greatness and power of the Ode, both as a personal utterance and a universal statement. It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>accident</b> <b>that</b> Wordsworth is here most eloquent. Becoming a whole person is the most powerful statement any of us can ever made. Wordsworth in the Ode here makes it for us." [...] In 1997, John Mahoney praised the various aspects of the poem while breaking down its rhythm and style. In particular, he emphasised the poem's full title as [...] "of great importance for all who study the poem carefully" [...] and claimed, [...] "The final stanza is a powerful and peculiarly Wordsworthian valediction." ...|$|E
