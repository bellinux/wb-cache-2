Shrinkage cracking and upward slab edge curling are common causes of cracking. The use of fibers {{as an alternative}} reinforcement to steel welded wire mesh and rebars is today an extensive practice for the reinforcement of concrete slab-on-grade. The post-cracking performance provided by glass macro-fibers at low crack openings is particularly convenient in structures {{with a high degree}} of redundancy, such as slabs on grade, where the ultimate bearing capacity involves very low crack openings (usually below 0. 3 mm). Referring to service conditions, it is well known that concrete shrinkage as well as thermal effects tend to be the principal reasons for the initial crack formation <b>in</b> <b>slabs</b> on grade, since these elements present large size, low thickness and high degree of restraint. A numerical study on the risk of cracking due to shrinkage <b>in</b> <b>slabs</b> on grade is presented herein.

30|$|The FSR is {{inversely}} proportional to {{the thickness of the}} resonator, and thus the FWHM in a nominal finesse. In addition, any change in refractive index translates into a wavelength shift from the cavity resonance according to Eq. (2).

This is seen in the literature when higher temperature is needed to induce same phase shift <b>in</b> thinner <b>slabs,</b> through the TOE. Thus, any change in the refractive index due to TOE and PDE is supposed to have weaker effect <b>in</b> thinner <b>slabs.</b> However, our simulation results (see Fig.  3) show that the relative change <b>in</b> phase <b>in</b> <b>slabs</b> with different thicknesses is the same.|$|R

It is shown that deflections <b>in</b> <b>slabs</b> {{are very sensitive to}} the assumed loading, boundary conditions and concrete tensile strength if the maximum span moment is close to the cracking moment. The theoretical background to span to depth rules is discussed along with the assumptions made in the derivation of the EC 2 span to depth rules. It is shown that the EC 2 span-to-depth rules can lead to significant reductions <b>in</b> <b>slab</b> thickness compared with BS 8110 since the rules account for the beneficial influence of the concrete tensile strength on deflection.

40|$|Context. Sausage {{oscillations}} {{are observed}} in plasma non-uniformities {{of the solar}} corona as axisymmetric perturbations of the non-uniformity. Often, these non-uniformities can be modelled as field-aligned slabs of the density enhancement. Aims. We perform parametric studies of sausage oscillations of plasma slabs, aiming to determine the dependence of the oscillation period on its parameters, and the onset of leaky and trapped regimes of the oscillations. Methods. Slabs with smooth transverse profiles of the density of a zero-beta plasma are perturbed by an impulsive localised perturbation of the sausage symmetry. <b>In</b> particular, the <b>slab</b> can contain an infinitely thin current sheet in its centre. The initial value problem is then solved numerically. The numerical results are subject to spectral analysis. The results are compared with analytical solutions for a slab with a step-function profile and also with sausage oscillations of a plasma cylinder. Results. We established that sausage oscillations <b>in</b> <b>slabs</b> generally have the same properties as in plasma cylinders. In the trapped regime, the sausage oscillation period increases {{with the increase in}} the longitudinal wavelength. In the leaky regime, the dependence of the period on the wavelength experiences saturation, and the period becomes independent of the wavelength in the long-wavelength limit. In the leaky regime the period is always longer than in the trapped regime. The sausage oscillation period <b>in</b> a <b>slab</b> is always longer than in a cylinder with the same transverse profile. <b>In</b> <b>slabs</b> with steeper transverse profiles, sausage oscillations have longer periods. The leaky regime occurs at shorter wavelengths <b>in</b> <b>slabs</b> with smoother profiles...|$|R

40|$|In this {{investigation}} strength and structural behaviour of prestressed concrete is studied with one full scale test of one flat slab, 16000 mm x 19000 mm, and three slabs on ground each 4000 mm x 4000 mm with thickness 150 mm. The flat slab was constructed and tested <b>in</b> Aalesund. This <b>slab</b> has nine circular columns as support, each with diameter 450 mm. Thickness of this test slab was 230 mm {{and there were}} two spans in each direction, 2 x 9000 mm in x-direction and 2 x 7500 mm in y-direction from centre to centre column. The slab was reinforced with twenty tendons in the middle column strip in y-direction and eight tendons in both outer column strips. In x-direction tendons were distributed with 340 mm distance. There were also ordinary reinforcement bars <b>in</b> the <b>slab.</b> Strain gauges were welded to this reinforcement, which together with the deflection measurements gives a good indication of deformation and strains in the structure. At a live load of 6. 5 kN/m 2 shear failure around the central column occurred: The shear capacity calculated after NS 3473 and EuroCode 2 was passed with 58 and 69 %, respectively. Time dependent and non-linear FE analyses were performed with the program system DIANA. Although calculated and measured results partly agree well, the test show that this type of structure is complicated to analyse by non-linear FEM. Prestressed slabs on ground have no tradition in Norway. In this test one reinforced and two prestressed slabs on ground were tested and compared to give a basis for a better solution for slabs on ground. This test was done in the laboratory at Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. The first slab is reinforced with 8 mm bars in both directions distributed at a distance of 150 mm in top and bottom. Slab two and three are prestressed with 100 mm 2 tendons located in the middle of slab thickness, and distributed at a distance of 630 mm <b>in</b> <b>slab</b> two and 930 mm <b>in</b> <b>slab</b> three. Strain gauges were glued to the reinforcement <b>in</b> <b>slab</b> one and at top and bottom surface of all three <b>slabs.</b> <b>In</b> <b>slab</b> two and three there were four load cells on the tendons. Each slab were loaded with three different load cases, in the centre of slab, at the edge and finally in the corner. This test shows that stiffness of sub-base {{is one of the most}} important parameters when calculating slabs on ground. Deflection and crack load level depends of this parameter. Since the finish of slabs on ground is important, it can be more interesting to find the load level when cracks start, than deflection for the slab. It is shown in this test that crack load level was higher <b>in</b> prestressed <b>slabs</b> than <b>in</b> reinforced <b>slab.</b> There was no crack in the top surface with load in the centre, but strain gauges in the bottom surface indicate that crack starts at a load of 28 kN <b>in</b> the reinforced <b>slab,</b> and 45 kN <b>in</b> the prestressed <b>slabs.</b> Load at the edge give a crack load of 30 kN <b>in</b> reinforced <b>slab,</b> 45 kN and 60 kN <b>in</b> prestressed <b>slabs.</b> The last load case gives crack load of 30 kN <b>in</b> reinforced <b>slab,</b> 107 kN and 75 kN <b>in</b> prestressed <b>slabs.</b> As for the flat slab, FE analyses were performed for all of the three slabs on ground, and analyses shows that a good understanding of parameters like stiffness of sub-base and tension softening model, is needed for correct result of the analyses. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
