40|$|It {{is known}} that if the {{objective}} of a wireless sensor network is not to reconstruct individual sensor readings at a fusion center but rather to compute a linear function of them, then the <b>interference</b> <b>property</b> of the wireless channel can be beneficially harnessed by letting nodes transmit simultaneously. Recently, an analog computation scheme was proposed {{to show that it}} is possible to take the advantage of the <b>interference</b> <b>property</b> even if nonlinear functions are to be computed. The scheme involves some pre-processing on the sensor readings and post-processing on the superimposed signals observed by the fusion center. Correspondingly, this paper provides a thorough base for a theory of analog-computing functions over wireless channels by specifying what is the maximum achievable. This means it is determined for networks of arbitrary topology which functions are generally analog-computable over the channel and how many wireless resources are needed. It turns out that the considerations are closely related to the famous 13 th Hilbert problem and that analog-computations can be universally performed in the sense that the pre-processing at sensor nodes is independent of the function to be computed. Universality reduces the complexity of transmitters and the signaling overhead, and it is shown that this property is preserved if nodes leave or join the network. Analog-computability is therefore of high practical relevance as it allows for an efficient computation of functions in sensor networks...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} a gossip {{algorithm}} for distributed averaging over a wireless sensor network.

This then provides a new abstraction for the physical layer: reliable linear equations instead of reliable bit pipes.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{recently}} brought into spotlight {{that through the}} exploitation of network coding concepts at physical-layer, the <b>interference</b> <b>property</b> of the wireless media can be {{proven to be a}} blessing in disguise. Nonetheless, most of the previous studies on this subject have either held unrealistic assumptions about the network properties, thus making them basically theoretical, or have otherwise been limited to fairly simple network topologies. We, on the other hand, believe to have devised a novel scheme, called Real Amplitude Scaling (RAS), that relaxes the aforementioned restrictions, and works with a wider range of network topologies and in circumstances that are closer to practice, for instance in lack of symbol-level synchronization and in the presence of noise, channel distortion and severe interference from other sources. The simulation results confirmed the superior performance of the proposed method in low SNRs, as well as the high SNR limits, where the effect of quantization error in the digital techniques becomes comparable to the channel.

40|$|In this paper, a {{clustered}} wireless {{sensor network}} is considered that is modeled {{as a set of}} coupled Gaussian multiple-access channels. The objective of the network is not to reconstruct individual sensor readings at designated fusion centers but rather to reliably compute some functions thereof. Our particular attention is on real-valued functions that can be represented as a post-processed sum of pre-processed sensor readings. Such functions are called nomographic functions and their special structure permits the utilization of the <b>interference</b> <b>property</b> of the Gaussian multiple-access channel to reliably compute many linear and nonlinear functions at significantly higher rates than those achievable with standard schemes that combat interference. Motivated by this observation, a computation scheme is proposed that combines a suitable data pre- and post-processing strategy with a nested lattice code designed to protect the sum of pre-processed sensor readings against the channel noise. After analyzing its computation rate performance, it is shown that at the cost of a reduced rate, the scheme can be extended to compute every continuous function of the sensor readings in a finite succession of steps, where in each step a different nomographic function is computed. This demonstrates the fundamental role of nomographic representations. Comment: to appear in IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communication...|$|E
40|$|A {{physical}} qubit {{is never}} isolated from its environment completely. As a trivial example, {{as in the}} case of a solid state qubit implementation, the physical qubit can be coupled directly to vibrations of its host lattice. It also can interact with the environment indirectly, as during gate operations through control fields. This interaction, even if it is weak, affects the dynamics of the qubit state and produces errors in quantum computation. Such errors do not have any analogue in classical computation. The initially-prepared, ideal state of a qubit eventually entangles with its environment after some time. Then, the quantum state cannot be described by a wave function for only a qubit. One must write a wave function for a whole system: qubit plus its environment. Such a wave function can have very complicated time dependence. So alternatively, one can use a density matrix representation. In the latter formalism a pure state of the qubit evolves to a mixed state due to decoherence, where the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix, coherences, decay to zero. In other words, the state loses its quantum <b>interference</b> <b>property.</b> The density matrix formalism [1, 2] is frequently used to describe the decoherence of quantum systems. However, one should understand the differences between the various types of averaging utilized by the density matrix formalism. 13. 1 Density matrix To describe the dynamics of a single isolated qubit you can use a wave function |ψ(t) 〉 = a(t) |↑〉+ b(t) |↓ 〉, (1) or a pure density matrix ρ(t) = |ψ(t) 〉 〈ψ(t) | = a(t) a∗(t) a(t) b∗(t) b(t) a∗(t) b(t) b∗(t...|$|E
