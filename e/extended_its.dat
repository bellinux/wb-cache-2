In response, Apple <b>extended</b> <b>its</b> 14-day return policy to 30 days.

5|$|At first, {{the forests}} of the {{watershed}} were not significantly affected, but after logging operations sprung up near {{the start of the}} 20th century, most of the virgin timber in the watershed was cleared. The first sawmills were built to provide lumber for local uses, such as building houses and barns. Soon, however, the Washington, Idaho and Montana Railway <b>extended</b> <b>its</b> tracks into the area, allowing lumber to be exported out of the basin. Logging {{turned out to be a}} very profitable industry but had a lasting negative effect on the ecology of the Potlatch River watershed.|$|E

Inside the Virginia Tech red zone, however, the Auburn offense again stumbled.

5|$|Between 1970 and 1975, {{advisories}} for {{systems in}} the eastern Pacific basins were initiated by the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC) {{as part of the}} National Weather Service (NWS) office in San Francisco, California. At that time, the advisories released were written in cooperation with the United States Navy Fleet Weather Center in Alameda and the Air Force Hurricane Liaison Officer at the McClellan Air Force Base. Following the move of the hurricane center to Redwood City in 1976, track files were created and altered by Arthur Pike and were later re-modified following the release of a study in 1980. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) <b>extended</b> <b>its</b> authority to the EPHC in 1988, and subsequently began maintaining the tracks.|$|E

In 1846 the Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway <b>extended</b> <b>its</b> lines to include a Thames wharf branch; eventually three steam ferries operated, but they proved inadequate to meet the growing demand. In October 1880 a public meeting was held in Woolwich to discuss setting up a locally run steam-ferry service, but the cost was seen as prohibitive.|$|E
