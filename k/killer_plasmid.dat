40|$|The {{double-stranded}} RNA <b>killer</b> <b>plasmid</b> gives yeast strains {{carrying it}} both {{the ability to}} secrete a protein toxin and immunity to that toxin. This report describes {{a new series of}} mutants in chromsomal genes needed for <b>killer</b> <b>plasmid</b> maintenance (mak genes). These mutants comprise 12 complementation groups. There are a total of at least 26 mak genes. Each mak gene product is needed for plasmid maintenance in diploids as well as in haploids. None of these mak mutations prevent the <b>killer</b> <b>plasmid</b> from entering the mak- spores in the process of meiotic sporulation. Complementation between mak mutants can be performed by mating meiotic spores from a makx/+ plasmid-carrying diploid with a maky haploid. If x = y, about half the diploid clones formed lose the <b>killer</b> <b>plasmid.</b> If x ≠ y, complementation occurs, and all of the diploid clones are killers...|$|E
40|$|Yeast strains {{carrying}} a 1. 5 x 106 molecular weight linear double-stranded RNA in virus-like particles (M dsRNA, the <b>killer</b> <b>plasmid</b> or virus) secrete a toxin that is lethal to strains not carrying this plasmid. Recessive mutations {{in any of}} four chromosomal genes (called ski 1 -ski 4) result in increased production of toxin activity. We report here a mutation of the <b>killer</b> <b>plasmid</b> (called [KIL-sd] for ski-dependent) that makes the <b>killer</b> <b>plasmid</b> dependent for its replication {{on the presence of}} a chromosomal mutation in any ski gene. Thus, the [KIL-sd] plasmid is lost from SKI+ strains. When the wild-type <b>killer</b> <b>plasmid,</b> [KIL-k], is introduced into a ski 2 – 2 [KIL-o] strain, the <b>killer</b> <b>plasmid</b> changes to a [KIL-sd] plasmid. This may represent a specific form of mutagenesis or selective replication in the ski 2 – 2 strain of [KIL-sd] variants (mutants) in the normal [KIL-k] population. The ski 2 – 1 and ski 2 – 3 mutations do not convert [KIL-k] to [KIL-sd], but ski 2 – 3 does allow maintenance of the [KIL-sd] plasmid. The [KIL-sd] plasmid thus lacks a plasmid site or product needed for replication in wild-type cells...|$|E
40|$|The K 1 <b>killer</b> <b>plasmid</b> of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a 1. 5 -megadalton linear {{double-stranded}} {{ribonucleic acid}} molecule. Using simplified screening and complementation procedures, we have isolated mutants in three chromosomal genes that are temperature sensitive for <b>killer</b> <b>plasmid</b> maintenance or replication. One of these genes, mak 28 - 1, was located on chromosome X. Two of the temperature-sensitive mutants rapidly lost the wild-type <b>killer</b> <b>plasmid</b> of A 364 A during spore germination and outgrowth at nonpermissive temperatures, but during vegetative growth, they only lowered the plasmid copy number. These two mutants {{did not lose}} two other wild-type K 1 killer plasmids, indicating a heterogeneity of the killer plasmids in laboratory yeast strains...|$|E
40|$|Two linear <b>killer</b> <b>plasmids</b> (pGKL 1 and pGKL 2) from Kluyveromyces lactis stably {{replicated}} {{and expressed}} the killer phenotype {{in a neutral}} petite mutant [(rho 0]) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, when cytoplasmic components were introduced by cytoduction from a wild-type [(rho+]) strain of S. cerevisiae, the linear plasmids became unstable and were frequently lost from the cytoductant cells during mitosis, giving rise to nonkiller clones. The phenomenon was ascribed to the incompatibility with the introduced S. cerevisiae mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), because the plasmid stability was restored by [rho 0] mutations in the cytoductant cells. Incompatibility with mtDNA was also apparent for the transmission of plasmids into diploid progeny in crosses between killer cells carrying the pGKL plasmids and [rho+] nonkiller cells lacking the plasmids. High-frequency transmission of the plasmids was observed in crosses lacking mtDNA [(rho 0] by [rho 0] crosses) and in crosses involving mutated mtDNA with large deletions of various regions of mitochondrial genome. In contrast, mutated mtDNA from various mit- mutations also exerted the incompatibility effect on the transmission of <b>plasmids.</b> Double-stranded RNA <b>killer</b> <b>plasmids</b> were stably maintained and transmitted {{in the presence of}} wild-type mtDNA and stably coexisted with pGKL <b>killer</b> <b>plasmids</b> in [rho 0] cells of S. cerevisiae...|$|R

40|$|Differential {{centrifugation}} of an osmotic lysate of K. lactis protoplasts {{showed that}} the linear DNA <b>killer</b> <b>plasmids</b> of K. lactis, pGKL 1 and pGKL 2, are almost exclusively present in the cytoplasmic fraction. This fractionation procedure allows the rapid isolation of large amounts of plasmid DNA without contamination by chromosomal and mitochondrial DNA. With these DNA preparations {{the size of the}} terminally bound proteins was estimated to be 28 and 36 kDal for pGKL 1 and pGKL 2, respectively. The entire pGKL 1 sequence (except for 21 base pairs at the right terminus) was cloned in a shuttle vector that permits autonomous replication in the nucleus of K. lactis. However, killer gene expression could not be established in transformants. In connection with the observed cytoplasmic localization, this result suggests that gene expression of the <b>killer</b> DNA <b>plasmids</b> is entirely cytoplasmic...|$|R

At least 28 chromosomal genes (mak genes) {{are required to}} maintain or replicate this plasmid. Recessive mutations in any of four other chromosomal genes (ski for superkiller) result in enhanced toxin production. We report that many ski- mak- double mutants are able to maintain the <b>killer</b> <b>plasmid,</b> indicating that the SKI products {{have an effect on}} plasmid replication.

40|$|Strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{carrying}} a 1. 4 x 106 dalton double-stranded (ds) RNA in virus-like particles (the <b>killer</b> <b>plasmid</b> or virus) secrete a toxin that is lethal to strains not carrying this plasmid (virus). The mak 10 gene {{is one of}} 24 chromosomal genes (called pets, mak 1, mak 2, [...] .) that are needed to maintain and replicate the <b>killer</b> <b>plasmid.</b> We report here isolation of spontaneous and induced mutants in which the <b>killer</b> <b>plasmid</b> is maintained and replicated {{in spite of a}} defect in the mak 10 gene. The bypass (or suppressor) mutations in these strains are in the mitochondrial genome. Respiratory deficiency produced by various chromosomal pet mutations, by chloramphenicol, or by antimycin A, does not bypass the mak 10 – 1 mutation. Several spontaneous mak 10 – 1 killer strains have about 12 -fold more of the <b>killer</b> <b>plasmid</b> ds RNA than do wild-type killers. Although the absence of mitochondrial DNA bypasses mak 10 – 1, it does not bypass pets– 1, mak 1 – 1, mak 3 – 1, mak 4 – 1, mak 5 – 1, mak 6 – 1, mak 7 – 1, or mak 8 – 1...|$|E

40|$|Ultraviolet {{irradiation}} {{gave rise}} to frequent curing of <b>killer</b> <b>plasmids</b> pGKl 1 and pGK 12 of Kluyveromyces lactis. Almost all of the nonkillers obtained lost both plasmids, {{but one of them}} lost only pGKl 1. The disappearance of pGKl 1 was accompanied by the simultaneous loss of the killer activity and of the resistance to the killer factor. A new plasmid, pGKl 1 S, was obtained, which arose from a deletion in the central region of pGKl 1. Genetic analysis suggested that pGKl 1 S has the killer gene lost by the deletion and the resistance gene intact and that pGKl 1 S shares the same replication control with pGKl 1...|$|R
40|$|A 10 -kb {{region of}} the nuclear genome of the yeast Vanderwaltozyma polyspora {{contains}} an unusual cluster of five pseudogenes homologous to five different genes from yeast <b>killer</b> viruses, <b>killer</b> <b>plasmids,</b> the 2 μm plasmid, and a Penicillium virus. By further database searches, we show that this phenomenon {{is not unique to}} V. polyspora but that about 40 % of the sequenced genomes of Saccharomycotina species contain integrated copies of genes from DNA plasmids or RNA viruses. We propose the name NUPAVs (nuclear sequences of plasmid and viral origin) for these objects, by analogy to NUMTs (nuclear copies of mitochondrial DNA) and NUPTs (nuclear copies of plastid DNA, in plants) of organellar origin. Although most of the NUPAVs are pseudogenes, one intact and active gene that was formed in this way is the KHS 1 chromosomal killer locus of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that KHS 1 is a NUPAV related to M 2 killer virus double-stranded RNA. Many NUPAVs are located beside tRNA genes, and some contain sequences from a mixture of different extrachromosomal sources. We propose that NUPAVs are sequences that were captured by the nuclear genome during the repair of double-strand breaks that occurred during evolution and that some of their properties may be explained by repeated breakage at fragile chromosomal sites...|$|R
40|$|Mutants of the <b>killer</b> <b>plasmid</b> of Saccharomyecs cerevisiae {{have been}} {{isolated}} that depend upon chromosomal diploidy for {{the expression of}} plasmid functions and for replication or maintenance of the plasmid itself. These mutants are not defective in any chromosomal gene needed for expression or replication of the <b>killer</b> <b>plasmid.</b> —Haploids carrying these mutant plasmids (called d for diploid-dependent) are either unable to kill or unable to resist being killed or both and show frequent loss of the plasmid. The wild-type phenotype (K+R+) is restored by mating the d plasmid-carrying strain with either (a) a wild-type sensitive strain which apparently has no killer plasmid; (b) a strain which has been cured of the <b>killer</b> <b>plasmid</b> by growth at elevated temperature; (c) a strain which has been cured of the plasmid by growth in the presence of cycloheximide; (d) a strain which has lost the plasmid because it carries a mutation in a chromosomal mak gene; or (e) a strain of the opposite mating type which carries the same d plasmid and has the same defective phenotype, indicating that the restoration of the normal phenotype is not due to recombination between plasmid genomes or complementation of plasmid or chromosomal genes. —Sporulation of the phenotypically K+R+ diploids formed in matings between d and wild-type nonkiller strains yields tetrads, all four of whose haploid spores are defective for killing or resistance or maintenance of the plasmid or a combination of these.

40|$|The killer {{character}} of yeast {{is determined by}} a 1. 4 x 106 molecular weight double-stranded RNA plasmid and at least 12 chromosomal genes. Wild-type strains of yeast that carry this plasmid (killers) secrete a toxin which is lethal only to strains not carrying this plasmid (sensitives). ——— We have isolated 28 independent recessive chromosomal mutants of a killer strain that have {{lost the ability to}} secrete an active toxin but remain resistant to the effects of the toxin and continue to carry the complete cytoplasmic killer genome. These mutants define two complementation groups, kex 1 and kex 2. Kex 1 is located on chromosome VII between ade 5 and lys 5. Kex 2 is located on chromosome XIV, but it does not show meiotic linkage to any gene previously located on this chromosome. ——— When the <b>killer</b> <b>plasmid</b> of kex 1 or kex 2 strains is eliminated by curing with heat or cycloheximide, the strains become sensitive to killing.

40|$|Extrachromosomal DNA in {{the form}} of covalently closed {{circular}} DNA molecules was isolated from killer and nonkiller xenosomes, bacterial endosymbionts of the marine protozoan Parauronema acutum. Restriction endonuclease digests of these molecules derived from 12 isolates revealed consistent, readily identifiable, differences in the pattern of fragments of the killer as compared with those present in the nonkiller. Transformation of the nonkiller to killer by infection is also accompanied by a change from the nonkiller to killer pattern. Based on analysis of fragments resulting from restriction endonuclease digests, two circular duplex DNA molecules, each 63 kilobase pairs (kbp) in length, were identified in the 263 - 20 nonkiller stock and mapped. The maps revealed that each possesses a single BamHI site and multiple BglI, BstIIE, PstI, and SalI sites. A distinguishing feature of these maps is that the two molecules share a region about 17 kbp in length in which multiple restriction sites are in register with each other. Allowing for a 0. 5 -kbp insertion or deletion and the introduction or removal of only a few restriction sites, an additional stretch extending approximately 31 kbp beyond this sequence could also be considered to be homologous. The structure of the <b>killer</b> <b>plasmid</b> appears to be more complex, and we have been unable, as yet, to construct physical maps for this DNA. We postulate that the <b>killer</b> <b>plasmid</b> DNA is composed of three, perhaps four, circular 63 -kbp duplexes, at least one which contains a single BamHI site and another which contains two BamHI sites. The remaining molecules may represent copies of either or both of the other two, modified to contain additional restriction sites. Transformation from the nonkiller to the killer is visualized as the insertion of restriction sites at various points along parent nonkiller plasmid DNA molecules. The mechanism by which these sites are introduced is unknown...|$|E

40|$|A {{system to}} isolate lexA-like genes of {{bacteria}} directly was developed. It {{is based upon}} the fact that the presence of a lexA(Def) mutation is lethal to SulA+ cells of Escherichia coli. This system is composed of a SulA- LexA(Def) HsdR- strain and a lexA-conditional <b>killer</b> vector (<b>plasmid</b> pUA 165) carrying the wild-type sulA gene of E. coli and a polylinker in which foreign DNA may be inserted. By using this method, the lexA-like genes of Salmonella typhimurium, Erwinia carotovora, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and P. putida were cloned. We also found that the LexA repressor of S. typhimurium presented the highest affinity for the SOS boxes of E. coli in vivo, whereas the LexA protein of P. aeruginosa had the lowest. Likewise, all of these LexA repressors were cleaved by the activated RecA protein of E. coli after DNA damage. Furthermore, under high-stringency conditions, the lexA gene of E. coli hybridized with the lexA genes of S. typhimurium and E. carotovora but not with those of P. aeruginosa and P. putida...|$|R
40|$|To enhance plasmid segregational {{stability}} in bacterial cells, {{two pairs of}} independent postsegregational killing loci (genes which induce host killing upon plasmid loss) isolated from plasmids R 1, R 483, or RP 4 (hok 1 /sok 1 pnd 1 or hok 1 /sok 1 parDE 1) were cloned into a common site of the b-galactosidase expression vector pMJR 1750 (ptac::lacZ 1) to form a series of plasmids in which the effect {{of one or two}} stability loci on segregational plasmid stability could be discerned. Adding two antisense killer loci (hok 1 /sok 1 pnd 1) decreased the specific growth rate by 50 % though they were more effective at reducing segregational instability than hok 1 /sok 1 alone. With the ptac promoter induced fully (2. 0 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside) and no antibiotic selection pressure, the combination of a proteic killer locus (parDE 1) with antisense killer loci (hok 1 /sok 1) had a negligible impact on specific growth rate, maintained high b-galactosidase expression, and led to a 30 and 190 % increase in {{segregational stability}} (based on stable generations) as compared to plasmids containing either hok 1 /sok 1 or parDE 1 alone, respectively. Use of hok 1 /sok 1 or parDE 1 alone with high cloned-gene expression led to ninefold and fourfold increases in the number of stable generations, respectively. Two convenient cloning cassettes have been constructed to facilitate cloning the dual hok 1 /sok 1 parDE 1 and hok 1 /sok 1 pnd 1 <b>killer</b> systems. <b>Plasmid</b> instability is a significant concern in the industria...|$|R
40|$|The linear DNA killer {{plasmids}} (pGKL 1 and pGKL 2) {{isolated from}} a Kluyveromyces lactis killer strain are also maintained and expressed its killer character in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The inverted terminal repetitions of 202 bp and 182 bp were found in pGKL 1 and pGKL 2, respectively. The pGKL 1 sequence showed an extremely high A + T content of 73. 2 % and it contained five large open reading frames.

40|$|We {{present a}} method for cloning restriction-modification (R-M) systems {{that is based on}} the use of a lethal plasmid (pKILLER). The plasmid carries a {{functional}} gene for a restriction endonuclease having the same DNA specificity as the R-M system of interest. The first step is the standard preparation of a representative, plasmid-borne genomic library. Then this library is transformed with the <b>killer</b> <b>plasmid.</b> The only surviving bacteria are those which carry the gene specifying a protective DNA methyltransferase. Conceptually, this in vivo selection approach resembles earlier methods in which a plasmid library was selected in vitro by digestion with a suitable restriction endonuclease, but it is much more efficient than those methods. The new method was successfully used to clone two R-M systems, BstZ 1 II from Bacillus stearothermophilus 14 P and Csp 231 I from Citrobacter sp. strain RFL 231, both isospecific to the prototype HindIII R-M system...|$|E

40|$|Two novel linear {{deoxyribonucleic acid}} plasmids, pGKl 1 and pGKl 2, were {{isolated}} from the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis. K. lactis strains harboring the pGK 1 plasmids killed a certain group of yeasts, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces italicus, Saccharomyces rouxii, K. lactis, Kluyveromyces thermotolerans, Kluyvermyces vanudenii, Torulopsis glabrata, Candida utilis, and Candida intermedia. In this experiment, the pGKl 1 and pGKl 2 plasmids were intergenerically transferred from a K. lactis killer strain into a non-killer (killer-sensitive) strain of S. cerevisiae {{by the use of}} a protoplast fusion technique. Both of the pGKl plasmids replicated autonomously and stably in the new host cells of S. cerevisiae and could coexist with the resident 2 -micrometers deoxyribonucleic acid plasmid.

40|$|The K 1 <b>killer</b> virus (or <b>plasmid)</b> of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a noninfectious {{double-stranded}} RNA genome found intracellularly {{packaged in}} an icosahedral capsid. This genome codes for a protein toxin and for resistance to that toxin. Defective interfering virus mutants are deletion derivatives {{of the killer}} virus double-stranded RNA genome; such mutants are called suppressive. Unlike strains carrying the wild-type genome, strains with these deletion derivatives are neither toxin producers nor toxin resistant. If both the suppressive and the wildtype virus are introduced into the same cell, most progeny become toxin-sensitive nonkillers (J. M. Somers, Genetics 74 : 571 - 579, 1973). Diploids formed by the mating of a killer with a suppressive strain were grown in liquid culture, and RNA was extracted from samples taken up to 41 generations after the mating. The ratio of killer RNA to suppressive RNA decreased with increasing generations; by 41 generations the killer RNA was barely detectable. The copy numbers of the suppressive genome and its parental killer were virtually the same in isogenic strains, as were the growth rates of diploid strains containing either virus alone. Therefore, suppressiveness, not being due to segregation or overgrowth by faster growing segregants, is likely due to preferential replication or maintenance of the suppressive genome. Three suppressive viruses, all derivatives of the same killer virus (T. K. Sweeney et al., Genetics 84 : 27 - 42, 1976), did not coexist stably. The evidence strongly indicates that the largest genome of the three slowly suppressed both of the smaller genomes, showing that larger genomes can suppress smaller ones and that suppression can occur between two suppressives. Of 48 isolates of strains carrying the suppressive viruses, 5 had newly detectable RNA species, all larger than the original suppressive genomes. At least seven genes necessary for maintenance of the wild-type killer virus (MAK genes) were needed by a suppressive mutant. No effect of ski mutations (affecting regulation of killer virus double-stranded RNA replication) on suppressiveness was observed...|$|R

Some of them overlap on different strands and some on the same strand. Northern blotting of K 2 transcripts shows that at least eight ORFs are transcribed. Analysis of the predicted aminoacid sequence of ORF 2 from K 2 reveals homology with the aminoacid sequence of ORF 1 from K 1 and with several viral DNA polymerases. The sequence of K 2 from Saccaromyces cerevisiae F 102 - 2 was also determined. Only one nucleotide difference was found between the K 2 sequence from the two yeasts.

40|$|We {{have shown}} {{previously}} that the M 1 double-stranded (ds) RNA (i. e., the <b>killer</b> <b>plasmid</b> [KIL-k 1]) that codes for a protein toxin requires spermidine or spermine for its replication. We now report that replication {{of two other}} ds RNA plasmids of yeast also requires polyamines: (i) M 2 ds RNA [(KIL-k 2]) and (ii) L-A-E, a ds RNA plasmid carrying the non-Mendelian genetic element [EXL]. Putrescine alone is sufficient to maintain L-A-E but {{is not sufficient to}} maintain either M 1 ds RNA or M 2 ds RNA, which require either spermidine or spermine. Once M 1 or M 2 or L-A-E is lost, it cannot be restored by the addition of polyamines. In contrast, L-A-HN, a ds RNA molecule that carries the cytoplasmic genes [HOK] and [NEX], is not lost during polyamine deprivation. It is striking that polyamine deprivation differentially affects L-A-E and L-A-HN, even though these two ds RNA molecules have more than 99 % homology. L-C, which is the same size as L-A but very different in sequence, is also not lost on polyamine starvation...|$|E
40|$|A {{triploid}} (3 n) {{strain of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae was constructed carrying a standard marker {{on each of}} chromosomes I through XVII in the -/+/+ configuration. This is called a "supertriploid. " Meiotic spores from this strain (n + ∼ n/ 2) were mated with a haploid (n) carrying an unmapped mutation. Meiotic analysis of each zygote clone (2 n + ∼ n/ 2) produced in this way resulted in elimination of an average of 4. 2 chromosomes as the possible location of the unmapped marker. The distribution of extra chromosomes in the 2 n + ∼ n/ 2) strains was nearly random. Meiotic segregants of these crosses carrying the unmapped mutation in the -/+ configuration were then crossed with multiply marked haploid strains to further narrow the possible location of the unmapped mutation to a single chromosome. Scoring of markers by complementation tests was simplified by mating spore clones with mixtures of a and α strains, each pair carrying {{the same set of}} markers.

40|$|Yeast strains {{carrying}} a double-stranded RNA plasmid of 1. 4 – 1. 7 x 106 daltons encapsulated in virus-like particles secrete a toxin that kills strains lacking this plasmid. The plasmid requires at least 24 chromosomal genes (pets, and mak 1 through mak 23) for its replication or maintenance. We have detected dominant Mendelian mutations (called KRB 1 for killer replication bypass) that bypass two chromosomal genes, mak 7 and pets, normally needed for plasmid replication. Strains mutant in mak 7 and carrying the bypass mutation (mak 7 – 1 KRB 1) are isolated as frequent K+R+ sectors of predominantly K-R - segregants from crosses of mak 7 – 1 with a wild-type killer. All KRB 1 mutations isolated {{in this way}} are inherited as single dominant centromere-linked chromosomal changes. They define a new centromere. KRB 1 is not a translational suppressor. KRB 1 strains contain a genetically normal <b>killer</b> <b>plasmid</b> and ds RNA species approximately the same in size and amount as do wild-type killers.

When the pGKL plasmids from K. lactis were transferred into Saccharomyces cerevisiae by transformation, non-killer transformants harboring pGKL 2 and new plasmids, F 1 of 7. 8 kb and F 2 of 3. 9 kb, were obtained. F 2 was shown to be a linear DNA arising from a 5 -kb deletion of the right part of pGKL 1. F 1 was an inverted dimer of F 2. Here we show that F 2 has two different terminal structures: one end has a protein attached at the 5 ' terminus whereas the two strands of duplex are linked together at the other end, thus forming a hairpin structure.

The [KIL-sd 1] plasmid is a replication-defective mutant of [KIL-k 1] {{that depends on}} one of the recessive chromosomal superkiller (ski-) mutations for its maintenance (Toh-e and Wickner 1979). This report concerns a means by which [KIL-sd 1] can be stably maintained in a SKI+ host. Strains carrying a plasmid we call [HOK] (helper of killer) stably maintain [KIL-sd 1]. [HOK] segregates 4 [HOK]: 0 in meiotic crosses and is efficiently transferred by cytoplasmic mixing (heterokaryon formation). [HOK] depends for its maintenance on the products of PET 18, MAK 3, and MAK 10, three chromosomal genes needed to maintain [KIL-k 1], but is independent of 10 other MAK genes and of MKT 1. [HOK] is not mitochondrial DNA and is unaffected by agents which convert ψ+ strains to ψ-. [HOK] is also distinct from the previously described plasmids [URE 3], 20 S RNA, 2 µ DNA, and [EXL]. Strains lacking [HOK] consistently have a four-fold lower copy number of L double-stranded RNA than strains carrying [HOK]...|$|E
40|$|Two linear {{deoxyribonucleic acid}} plasmids, {{designated}} pGK 11 and pGK 12, were {{isolated from the}} yeast Kluyveromyces lactis IFO 1267. pGK 11 and pGK 12 had molecular weights of 5. 4 X 10 (6) and 8. 4 X 10 (6), respectively. Both plasmids possessed the same density of 1. 687 g/cm 3, lighter than the densities of mitochondrial (1. 692 g/cm 3) and nuclear (1. 699 g/cm 3) deoxyribonucleic acids. A restriction map of pGK 11 was constructed from digestions by EcoRI, HindIII, PstI, and BamHI. pGK 12 was cleaved by EcoRI into seven fragments and by BamHI into two fragments K. lactis IFO 1267 killed Saccharomyces cerevisiae sensitive and killer strains and certain strains of Saccharomyces italicus, K. lactis, Kluyveromyces thermotolerans, and K. vanudenii. All K. lactis strains lacking the pGK 1 plasmids were nonkillers. A hybrid was constructed between K. lactis IFO 1267 and a nonkiller K. lactis strain lacking the plasmids and subjected to tetrad analysis after sporulation. The killer character was extrachromosomally transmitted in all tetrads {{in association with the}} pGK 1 plasmids. The double-stranded ribonucleic acid <b>killer</b> <b>plasmid</b> could not be detected in any K. lactis killer strains. It is thus highly probable that the killer character is mediated by the linear deoxyribonucleic acid plasmids. A single chromosomal gene was found which was responsible for the resistance to the K. lactis killer...|$|E
40|$|The ORF 5 of Kluyveromyces lactis <b>killer</b> <b>plasmid</b> pGKL 2 (k 2) {{is capable}} of {{encoding}} a small neutral protein of 18 kDa of as yet unassigned function. Although this ORF is located between two larger ORFs, 4 and 6, which it overlaps, RNA analysis showed that it is transcribed monocistronically. One-step gene disruption of ORF 5, via in vivo homologous recombination between native plasmid k 2 and a transfer vector employing the Saccharomyces cerevisiae LEU 2 gene fused to the k 2 UCS 5 element, yielded Leu+ transformants at high frequencies. The transformants were found to carry a new recombinant form of k 2 with ORF 5 replaced by the LEU 2 marker, termed rk 2, {{in addition to the}} wild-type plasmids k 1 and k 2. Northern analysis detected a plasmid-dependent LEU 2 transcript distinct in size and regulation from its nuclear counterpart. Recombinant plasmid, rk 2, was unable to displace native k 2 during Leu+ selective growth; however rk 2 was displaced by k 2 during non-selective growth. Thus, ORF 5 appears to be an essential gene for plasmid integrity and/or maintenance. The ORF 5 product was detected by over-expression of an epitope-tagged allele in the baculovirus system. Western analysis using a monoclonal antibody specific for the epitope tag identified a protein band with apparent molecular weight of 20 kDa, corresponding in size to the predicted product. 7252...|$|E
40|$|The killer {{phenotype}} of the lactose-utilising yeast Kluyveromyces lactis {{is dependent}} upon the presence of two linear, dsDNA plasmids termed pGKL 1 (K 1) and pGKL 2 (K 2). Both plasmids have terminal inverted repeat sequences (TIRs) and terminal proteins (TPs) linked to their 5 ' ends. Structurally similar genetic elements, termed invertrons, which include human adenovirus and Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage 29, {{have been shown to}} replicate their DNA by a protein-primed mechanism. The cytoplasmic location of K 1 and K 2, and the finding of putative plasmid-encoded family of B DNA polymerases suggested that they encode their own protein-primed replication system.;Although many invertrons have been described in various organisms, with the exception of adenovirus and bacteriophage 29, little is known abut their biology. Difficulties arise in studying <b>killer</b> <b>plasmid</b> gene function as their structure cannot be readily modified by in vitro manipulation due to the presence of protein-linked termini. Furthermore, the killer plasmids appear to encode their own transcription mechanism, and their genes are not correctly expressed by the host transcription system when cloned into yeast on conventional nuclear located circular vectors. Although in vitro homologous recombination studies have progressed our understanding of the killer plasmids, a method for their in vitro modification and transformation has not been developed, and biochemical and molecular analysis has progressed slowly.;To advance study in these areas, a large scale procedure for the purification of the K. lactis linear killer plasmids, with intact terminal proteins (TPs), was developed using a gentle NP 40 -induced lysis of yeast spheroplasts, and standard chromatography methods...|$|E
40|$|Strains of the budding-yeast Kluyveromyces lactis {{that produce}} killer-toxin contain two linear dsDNA plasmids, kl (8. 9 Kb) and (13. 4 Kb). The genes of kl are preceded by no known gene {{expression}} signals and transcripts {{are probably not}} polyadenylated. Classical and molecular genetic techniques {{have been used to}} attempt to investigate the mechanisms of replication, partitioning and gene expression utilised by these novel elements. Such studies have led to the preparation of a number of vectors and strains of use in this and other analyses. Data or presented which indicate the killer plasmids exist within the cytoplasm of the yeast cell, and probably do not require the nuclear RNA polymerases I, II or III for transcription of their genes. A preparation procedure has been developed for the linear plasmids, and plasmid k 2, thought to encode factors necessary for the maintenance or expression of k 1, has been cloned. Sequence analysis of 7, 7 kb of plasmid k 2 revealed the presence of several open reading frames (ORFs) organised in a similar manner to those of plasmid k 1. One of these is predicted to encode a product with homology to two different subunits found within several DNA-directed RNA polymerases. Another ORF potentially encodes a polypeptide with homology to a DNA helicase encoded by, and required for accurate transcription of, the cytoplasmic poxvirus vaccinia. These two k 2 products may be components of a killer plasmid-specific cytoplasmic gene expression system. Possible mechanisms of <b>killer</b> <b>plasmid</b> replication, partitioning and gene expression are discussed...|$|E
