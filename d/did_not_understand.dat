5|$|After leaving Hull, Harries {{moved to}} London {{to work for}} the Southern News Service news agency, writing diary pieces for the Daily Mail and News of the World from 1975 to 1976. On the advice of a friend, he applied for a {{position}} as a researcher for Granada Television in Manchester. He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> the appeal of television production, and as a result he was turned away at two interviews before being hired in 1976.|$|E

5|$|The Nyasaland African Congress (NAC) was {{particularly}} vocal about increased African {{representation in the}} Nyasaland Legislative Council, demanding in September 1957 an African majority in the council. Nyasaland's inclusion in the federation was never a goal of its proponents, it was there primarily {{because it was not}} economically viable by itself. Welensky <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> or appreciate the party's goal of increased African representation or secession when it relied on the federation for its well being.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} seen by 7.87 million {{following}} its broadcast on BBC One, however, despite the measures used to provide the balanced view, it was met with considerable controversy from Muslims, among them the Muslim Council of Britain, for fear that the episode would incite Islamophobia. Nearly a thousand complaints were made, although cast and crew members argued that the Muslims who opposed the episode <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> the context.|$|E

5|$|Another {{prominent}} {{opponent of}} the Theses was Johann Eck, Luther's friend and a theologian at the University of Ingolstadt. Eck wrote a refutation, intended for the Bishop of Eichst√§tt, entitled the Obelisks. This was {{in reference to the}} obelisks used to mark heretical passages in texts in the Middle Ages. It was a harsh and unexpected personal attack, charging Luther with heresy and stupidity. Luther responded privately with the Asterisks, titled after the asterisk marks then used to highlight important texts. Luther's response was angry and he expressed the opinion that Eck <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> the matter on which he wrote. The dispute between Luther and Eck would become public in the 1519 Leipzig Debate.|$|E
5|$|Aqua's {{character}} has received mixed response from video game publications, with initial comments {{focused on her}} brief appearance in Kingdom Hearts II. Writing for GamesRadar, Chris Antista commented that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> the importance of Aqua and the other characters being briefly featured in Kingdom Hearts II; only later was their importance explored {{at the end of}} Birth by Sleep. Prior to Aqua's appearance in Birth by Sleeps trailers, 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish stated that fans speculated the character would be male. Having played a demo from Birth by Sleep as Aqua in the E3 2010, Ryan Clements from IGN enjoyed her character due to her gameplay mechanics.|$|E

Hilliard scored 1,413 points in his high school career, finishing second in Liberty history to Warren West. He committed to Villanova in November 2010. When Hilliard informed his mother he was receiving a full scholarship to Villanova, she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> and was trying to figure how much she would have to pay for her son's education. In addition to his basketball prowess, Hilliard was the quarterback on his high school football team and could throw the ball 65 yards.|$|E

5|$|Jenner would {{normally}} {{wake up to}} pray at 5am each day. In the 1940s, Jenner left the Glanton Brethren and joined the Open Brethren. For {{the rest of his}} life, Jenner attended Open Brethren churches: one on Goulburn Street in Sydney and the other in Bexley, New South Wales. At these churches, people <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> what narcolepsy was and thought that Jenner was consistently falling asleep during services because he lacked respect for God. The church on Goulburn Street also disapproved of his partnership with other Christian organisations and churches; Jenner actively partnered with The Navigators, Campaigners for Christ, Baptists, Anglicans, and Methodists.|$|E

He would issue video game challenges and answered questions on cheats and tips. The show's host, Dominik Diamond, claimed that Moore <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> anything that he said on the show, yet managed to record his contributions in single takes.|$|E

Weichmann <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> the reference; Venice Preserv'd is about an assassination plot. Booth's scheme to kidnap Lincoln was no longer feasible with the Union Army's capture of Richmond and Lee's surrender, and he changed his goal to assassination.|$|E

5|$|Rolling Thunder {{had begun}} as a {{campaign}} of psychological and strategic persuasion, but it changed very quickly to interdiction, a tactical mission. Its ultimate failure had two sources, both of which lay with the civilian and military policy-makers in Washington: first, neither group could ever conceive that the North Vietnamese would endure under the punishment that they would unleash upon it. The civilians, moreover, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> air power {{well enough to know}} that their policies might be crippling it; second, the American military leadership failed to initially propose and develop, or later to adapt, an appropriate strategy for the war.|$|E
5|$|Shea's {{relationship}} with the engineers at North American was a difficult one. While Shea blamed North American's management for the continuing difficulties {{in the development of}} the command module, project leader Harrison Storms felt that NASA itself was far from blameless. It had delayed in making key design decisions, and persisted in making significant changes to the design once construction had begun. While Shea did his part in attempting to control the change requests, Storms felt that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> or sympathize with the inevitable problems involved in the day-to-day work of manufacturing.|$|E
5|$|The first {{batches of}} vinegar {{produced}} by fermentation probably followed {{errors in the}} winemaking process. If must is fermented at too high a temperature, acetobacter will overwhelm the yeast naturally occurring on the grapes. As the demand for vinegar for culinary, medical, and sanitary purposes increased, vintners quickly learned to use other organic materials to produce vinegar in the hot summer months before the grapes were ripe and ready for processing into wine. This method was slow, however, and not always successful, as the vintners <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> the process.|$|E

5|$|Upon being {{confirmed}} in the Catholic Church in 1966, she adopted Veronica as a confirmation name. She {{was raised in}} the Detroit suburbs of Pontiac and Avon Township (now Rochester Hills). Months before her mother died of breast cancer at age 30 on December 1, 1963, Madonna noticed changes in her behavior and personality, although she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> the reason. Her mother was at a loss to explain her medical condition, and often began to cry when Madonna questioned her about it. Madonna later acknowledged that she had not grasped the concept of her mother dying.|$|E
5|$|A {{long and}} winding route {{had to be}} taken to reach topside; the steerage-class accommodation, located on C through G decks, was at the extreme ends of the decks, and so was the {{farthest}} away from the lifeboats. By contrast, the first-class accommodation was located on the upper decks and so was nearest. Proximity to the lifeboats thus became a key factor in determining who got into them. To add to the difficulty, many of the steerage passengers <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> or speak English. It was perhaps no coincidence that English-speaking Irish immigrants were disproportionately represented among the steerage passengers who survived. Many of those who did survive owed their lives to third-class steward John Edward Hart, who organised three trips into the ship's interior to escort groups of third-class passengers up to the boat deck. Others made their way through open barriers or climbed emergency ladders.|$|E
5|$|Bakshi {{recognized}} Kricfalusi's talent, {{and wanted}} {{to put him in}} charge of a project that would showcase the young animator's skills. Bakshi and Kricfalusi co-wrote the screenplay Bobby's Girl as a take on the teen films of the era. Jeff Sagansky, president of production at TriStar Pictures, put up $150,000 to develop the project, prompting Bakshi to move back to Los Angeles. When Sagansky left TriStar, Bakshi was forced to pitch the film again, but the studio's new executives <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> its appeal and cut off financing. Bakshi and Zingarelli began to develop a feature about Hollywood's Golden Age, and Bakshi Productions crewmembers worked on proposed cartoons influenced by pulp fiction. Bobby's Girl was reworked as a potential prime time series called Suzy's in Love, but attracted no serious interest.|$|E
