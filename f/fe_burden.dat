40|$|Recently, the {{capability}} of deep learning-based approaches, especially deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has been investigated for hyperspectral remote sensing feature extraction (FE) and classification. Due to {{the large number of}} learnable parameters in convolutional filters, lots of training samples are needed in deep CNNs to avoid the overfitting problem. On the other hand, Gabor filtering can effectively extract spatial information including edges and textures, which may reduce the <b>FE</b> <b>burden</b> of the CNNs. In this letter, {{in order to make the}} most of deep CNN and Gabor filtering, a new strategy, which combines Gabor filters with convolutional filters, is proposed for hyperspectral image classification to mitigate the problem of overfitting. The obtained results reveal that the proposed model provides competitive results in terms of classification accuracy, especially when only a limited number of training samples are available...|$|E

After dialysis was in it iated, patients were scheduled to get a tunne led cuf fed catheter befo re leaving the hospital. By ins truc ting the fellows to forgo p lacement of the temporary cathete r and go direct ly to a tunne led cuf fed catheter, we saved patients from an extraneous p rocedure that had the inherent possibil it y of infection.

Vascular Access Needs a Special Focus Certainly, the economics of the academic setting may not be the same for the f reestanding outpatient env ironment, where the majority of dialys is patients in this country are treated. My charge at UNC came with no purse strings at-tached; outpatient clin ics have to justi fy every hiring decision. But I do bel ieve that by having one person who focuses on the patientsÕ vascula r access needs and fol lows an algor ithm o f bes t p ract ice (see sidebar, p. 52), the position of the vascu lar access coordinato r pays for itself.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{concentrations}} {{and distribution of}} heavy metals in the organs and tissues of the Adelie penguin collected around Syowa Station, Antarctica, in 1981,and also discusses the changes of heavy metal accumulation with the reproductive activity. The metal concentrations of the whole Adelie penguin {{were in the order}} of Fe>Zn>Cu>Mn・Cd>Hg>Pb・Ni. High bioaccumulations of Cd and Hg were observed. Generally, higher concentrations of the metals were found in the liver and kidney. However, the concentrations of Pb, Ni, Hg and Cu were relatively high in feather, and Mn and Zn were higher in the bone. Relatively high concentrations of Mn, Zn and Cd were found in the pancreas. A majority (> 60 %) of the <b>Fe</b> and Cu <b>burdens</b> in the whole body was in muscle which constituted an average of 50 % of the body weight. Relatively high burdens of Mn and Zn were in the bone also, {{and more than half of}} the body burden of Cd was found in the kidney. Comparatively high burdens of Cu and Hg were in the feather, especially Hg in the feather was approximately 60 % of the body burden. Effect of egg-laying on the body metal contents of adult female was not significant. However, the Fe concentrations in livers of the starved males were higher than those of the females and other males, while the bone Zn showed lower concentrations in males than females. Furthermore, an increase of metal concentrations in the body and a redistribution of body Fe were observed as a result of advanced starvation...|$|R
40|$|Fe supplementation is {{a common}} {{strategy}} to correct Fe-deficiency anaemia in children; however, it may modify the gut microbiota and increase the risk for enteropathogenic infection. In the present study, we studied the impact of Fe supplementation on the abundance of dominant bacterial groups in the gut, faecal SCFA concentration and gut inflammation in children living in rural South Africa. In a randomised, placebo-controlled intervention trial of 38 weeks, 6 - to 11 -year-old children with Fe deficiency received orally either tablets containing 50 mg Fe as FeSO 4 (n 22) for 4 d/week or identical placebo (n 27). In addition, Fe-sufficient children (n 24) were included as a non-treated reference group. Faecal samples were analysed at baseline and at 2, 12 and 38 weeks {{to determine the effects}} of Fe supplementation on ten bacterial groups in the gut (quantitative PCR), faecal SCFA concentration (HPLC) and gut inflammation (faecal calprotectin concentration). At baseline, concentrations of bacterial groups in the gut, faecal SCFA and faecal calprotectin did not differ between Fe-deficient and Fe-sufficient children. Fe supplementation significantly improved Fe status in Fe-deficient children and did not significantly increase faecal calprotectin concentration. Moreover, no significant effect of Fe treatment or time £ treatment interaction on the concentrations of bacterial groups in the gut or faecal SCFA was observed compared with the placebo treatment. Also, there were no significant differences observed in the concentrations of any of the bacterial target groups or faecal SCFA at 2, 12 or 38 weeks between the three groups of children when correcting for baseline values. The present study suggests that in African children with a low enteropathogen <b>burden,</b> <b>Fe</b> status and dietary Fe supplementation did not significantly affect the dominant bacterial groups in the gut, faecal SCFA concentration or gut inflammation.

40|$|Inanga (Galaxias maculatus) are a {{culturally}} and economically important fish species in New Zealand and abroad. However, {{very little is}} known about their ability to deal with trace element contamination. As a scaleless fish with the ability to survive in relatively extreme environments, they may not fit toxicity models (such as the biotic ligand model; BLM) based on other fish species. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine how this fish responds to elevated trace elements in both the laboratory and field in order to determine the applicability of these toxicity models. In order to determine the impacts of stress on ion transport and subsequent metal toxicity, inanga were exposed to handling stress and measures of ion uptake were collected. Handling stress was shown to result in increased ventilation rates, resulting in stimulated sodium (Na+) efflux. A compensatory increase in Na+ influx was also measured as a result of this stress. Inanga largely recovered from this ionoregulatory stress within 2 hours, with full recovery after 24 hours. This was indicative of a rapid homeostatic response for maintaining ion balance. Enhanced Na+ uptake in response to this stress resulted in increased copper (Cu) uptake in Cu-contaminated water, suggesting stressed fish will accumulate more Cu (and likely other Na+ mimics) than an unstressed fish. These results suggest a heightened vulnerability of inanga to this type of contaminant as a result of exercise stress during migrations. A combination of field and laboratory studies was used in order to measure trace element accumulation in inanga. In situ field studies showed changes to aluminum (Al) and iron (<b>Fe)</b> body <b>burdens</b> when inanga were placed in streams of varying trace element concentrations along the West Coast of the South Island. However, other trace elements measured did not alter over the period of exposure (9 - 10 days). Biochemical biomarker analysis showed no changes in the activity of Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA), but a marker of lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances; TBARS) was elevated in one stream. Analysis suggested that stream pH was the major driver of this effect, whether directly or via changes to metal bioavailability. Subsequent laboratory exposures (96 h) of inanga to 1. 2, 2. 7, 10. 8, and 44 µg L- 1 dissolved Fe and 5. 6, 23. 3, 60. 7, and 128. 7 µg L- 1 dissolved zinc (Zn) showed no difference in whole body trace element accumulation, ammonia excretion, ion influx (Ca 2 + and Na+), and TBARS. There were significant differences in oxygen consumption (MO 2) after Fe exposures, with increases in the 2. 7 and 44 µg L- 1 dissolved Fe exposures. Laboratory exposure results suggest inanga are relatively insensitive to short-term Fe and Zn exposures. Both in vivo (whole body partitioning) and in vitro (Ussing chamber) techniques were used to determine the influence of cutaneous ion transport on preventing trace element accumulation. Results suggest inanga use their skin as an additional site of calcium (Ca 2 +) and Na+ uptake. This is the first study to confirm these ion transport capabilities in inanga, and revealed that up to 48 % of Na+ uptake may occur across the skin. Pharmacological inhibition of Ca 2 + uptake was achieved by known Ca 2 + channel blockers (verapamil and lanthanum). Furthermore Fe and Zn impaired cutaneous Ca 2 + transport, indicating that ion transport pathways in the skin modulate in response to these metals...|$|R
