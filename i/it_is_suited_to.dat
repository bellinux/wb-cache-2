5|$|Two main {{clinical}} {{staging systems}} {{are used to}} classify HIV and HIV-related disease for surveillance purposes: the WHO disease staging system for HIV infection and disease, and the CDC classification system for HIV infection. The CDC's classification system is more frequently adopted in developed countries. Since the WHO's staging system does not require laboratory tests, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> the resource-restricted conditions encountered in developing countries, where {{it can also be}} used to help guide clinical management. Despite their differences, the two systems allow comparison for statistical purposes.|$|E
2500|$|Constraint logic {{programming}} extends Prolog to include concepts from constraint satisfaction. A constraint logic program allows constraints {{in the body}} of clauses, such as: A(X,Y) :- X+Y>0. [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> large-scale combinatorial optimisation problems and is thus useful for applications in industrial settings, such as automated time-tabling and production scheduling. Most Prolog systems ship with at least one constraint solver for finite domains, and often also with solvers for other domains like rational numbers.|$|E
