40|$|Abstract—Inverted stagger {{hexagonal}} hydrogenated amor-phous silicon thin-film transistors (a-Si:H HEX-TFTs) were fabri-cated with a five-photomask process used in {{the processing}} of the active-matrix liquid crystal displays. We show that the output cur-rent of a-Si:H HEX-TFTs connected in parallel increases linearly with their number within a given pixel circuit. Current–voltage measurements indicate that a high ON–OFF current ratio and a low subthreshold slope can be maintained for multiple HEX-TFTs connected in parallel, whereas the field-effect mobility and thresh-old voltage remain identical to a single a-Si:H HEX-TFT. Due to a unique device geometry, an enhanced electrical stability and a larger pixel aperture ratio can be achieved in the multiple a-Si:H HEX-TFT in comparison to a standard single a-Si:H TFT having the same channel width. These HEX-TFT electrical character-istics are very desirable for active-matrix organic light-emitting displays.
