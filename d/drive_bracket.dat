50|$|The most lasting {{impact and}} {{significant}} {{change of the}} Act was the indexing {{of the tax code}} parameters for inflation. Of the nine federal tax laws between 1968 and this Act, six were tax cuts compensating for inflation <b>driven</b> <b>bracket</b> creep. Following enactment in August 1981, the first 5% of the 25% total cuts took place beginning in October. An additional 10% began in July 1982, followed by a third decrease of 10% beginning in July 1983.|$|R

5000|$|Brackets : Groups {{letters and}} numbers {{describing}} the same bogie. For example, (A1A) indicates a three-axle bogie with the outer two axles <b>driven.</b> When <b>brackets</b> are used a prime {{is not needed}} to indicate a bogie. Mallet locomotives can be indicated by bracketing the front power unit — for example, the Union Pacific Big Boy, 4-8-8-4 in Whyte notation, is (2′D)D2′ in UIC notation.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of the {{administration}} building at North Texas State Teacher's college, visible in the background, {{at the end of}} a drive. There are buildings partially visible on either side of the drive, the history building (Curry Hall) is on the left and the language building is on the right. In the foreground, the <b>drive</b> is <b>bracketed</b> by white posts and open gates; it is lined by hedges and plants. Handwritten notes on the back of the photo say, "Administration Building Before 1958 " at the top and "Auditorium Bldg - exterior" at the bottom...|$|R
5000|$|E-type : This type front derailleurs do not clamp {{around the}} frame's seat tube, but instead are {{attached}} to the frame by a plate mounted under the <b>drive</b> side bottom <b>bracket</b> cup and a screw threaded into a boss on the seat tube. These derailleurs are usually found on mountain bikes with rear suspension components that do not allow space for a normal derailleur's clamp to go around the seat tube.|$|R
50|$|The SE was {{designed}} to accommodate either one or two floppy drives, or a floppy drive and a hard <b>drive.</b> After-market <b>brackets</b> were designed to allow the SE to accommodate two floppy drives {{as well as a}} hard drive, however it was not a configuration supported by Apple. In addition an external floppy disk drive could also be connected, making the SE the only other Macintosh besides the Macintosh Portable and Macintosh II which could support three floppy drives, though its increased storage, RAM capacity and optional internal hard drive rendered the external drives less of a necessity than for its predecessors. After Apple introduced the Macintosh SE/30 in January 1989, a logic board upgrade was sold by Apple dealers as a high-cost upgrade for the SE, consisting of a new SE/30 motherboard, case front and internal chassis to accommodate the upgrade components.|$|R
50|$|Truvativ's {{approach}} is an {{evolution of the}} ISIS <b>Drive</b> bottom <b>bracket.</b> The spindle is made longer, and the bearings sit outside the bottom bracket shell. The spindle is permanently pressed into the right crank. The left side spline interface looks similar, but is different so as to prevent installation of older ISIS Drive crankarms—which are no longer compatible because Q-factor and chainline can not be maintained using these older cranks with an external bearing BB. They refer to this design as 'Giga-X-Pipe' or 'GXP.' They also make a heavier duty external bearing bottom bracket called 'Howitzer.' The Howitzer BB {{is more like a}} traditional BB in that the spindle is not permanently pressed into the right crank. Again, the Howitzer spline looks similar to the ISIS Drive standard spline but is actually different, so as to prevent the usage of ISIS Drive cranks on the external bearing BB, which would affect chainline and Q-factor.|$|R
5000|$|In 2004 John Tolhurst {{developed}} a kit to convert a regular (diamond-frame, or upright) bicycle to a front-wheel drive recumbent. The {{purpose of the}} kit {{was to provide a}} means to circumvent the high purchase price of recumbent bicycles. [...] The conversion kit served its purpose but had several disadvantages including the aesthetics of the converted bicycles, the difficulty of fitting the bike to the rider, as well as concerns about the longevity of a frame not designed for the stresses encountered in recumbent bicycles. A further concern was the lack of a direct connection between the handlebars and the bottom bracket, a problem also seen in previous recumbent bicycle designs. John Tolhurst designed the Silvio to overcome these shortcomings and was awarded a US patent for the front wheel <b>drive</b> moving bottom <b>bracket</b> Silvio in 2010.|$|R
30|$|Investigating the {{profiles}} of the four segments has concerned socio-demographic variables, motivations of choice, qualities associated with products of local origin and Schwartz values. Socio-demographic profiling conducted {{by means of the}} CHAID method points out significant differences with respect to age (LR chi-square =  23.89, df =  6; p value =  0.003) and with respect to the presence of children under 12 (LR chi-square =  13.10, df =  3; p value =  0.018). In particular, younger people (under 45  years of age) prevail among the locavores and among the price <b>driven,</b> the age <b>bracket</b> between 45 and 54 is the most present among the non-choosers, while the elderly have greater weight among the savers. On the other hand, the presence of children under 12  years of age proves to be significantly less in the cluster of the savers. The following characteristics, however, did not prove significantly different among the classes: country, residence in urban or rural areas, gender, level of education, profession, family income, number of family members and frequency with which individuals go to restaurants.|$|R
