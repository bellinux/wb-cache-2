25|$|The {{process of}} setting up the {{transitional}} government in June 2002 by the <b>Loya</b> <b>Jirga</b> took many steps involving local government. First, at the district and municipal level, traditional shura councils met to pick electors—persons who cast ballots for <b>Loya</b> <b>Jirga</b> delegates. Each district or municipality had to choose a predetermined number of electors, based {{on the size of}} its population. The electors then traveled to regional centers and cast ballots, to choose from amongst themselves a smaller number of <b>loya</b> <b>jirga</b> delegates— according to allotted numbers assigned to each district. The delegates then took part in the <b>Loya</b> <b>Jirga.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Pasthun {{element in}} the Transitional {{administration}} was stronger than in the interim administration and the <b>loya</b> <b>jirga</b> was meant in part to increase civilian influence in the government.

The three vice-presidents Karzai announced on the <b>Loya</b> <b>Jirga,</b> Khalili, Qadir and Fahim were all Northern Alliance commanders, although none of them had the same ethnic background. The powerful Tajik Jamiat-e Islami trio Fahim, Qanuni and Abdullah kept important positions in the new cabinet.|$|R
