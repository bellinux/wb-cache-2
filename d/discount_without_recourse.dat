50|$|Heller was {{a pioneer}} {{of the use of}} {{factoring}} and developed it into a more sophisticated form of finance of company business accounts receivable, thus providing capital for businesses to grow by giving them cash to expand the business cycle by purchasing an account receivable at a <b>discount,</b> with or <b>without</b> <b>recourse</b> to the seller. Then, by owning it, he would collect the balance of the receivable in full. The profit was derived by the amount of discount collected by the factor. As the factoring business expanded, it was done in bulk with contractually obligated clients selling their receivables by assignment to the factoring company. Advances against these receivables purchased were made and the client paid a fee to the factor. As American businesses became more sophisticated and manufacturing became more prominent after World War II, certain industries primary used factoring as a form of business finance and credit insurance on the credit risk of its customers. These industries were primarily involved with the manufacturing of textiles and carpeting, although other businesses used this type of financing model for their own credit needs. Capital for businesses was not then available from banks because the banks felt business loans were too risky.|$|R
