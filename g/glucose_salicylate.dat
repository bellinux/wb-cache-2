40|$|The {{ability of}} sodium {{salicylate}} (3 g) {{to enhance the}} blood glucose lowering action of chlorpropamide (200 mg) has been confirmed in healthy male volunteers who received an oral test dose of 50 g <b>glucose.</b> <b>Salicylate</b> raised the plasma concentration of insulin and lowered that of cortisol but did not alter the concentration of chlorpropamide. The area under the blood glucose concentration-time curve {{was used as the}} measure of drug response and the significance of drug effects was assessed by analysis of variance. In one study on five volunteers the effect of combining salicylate and chlorpropamide was additive. In a second study on six volunteers 200 mg chlorpropamide, 3 g sodium salicylate and 100 mg chlorpropamide + 1. 5 g salicylate were equi-effective. The enhancement of chlorpropamide action by salicylate in this single dose study is consistent with the summation of similar effects. It is not necessary to postulate an interaction...|$|E
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} whether chemically induced motility patterns of bacteria may affect their transport in porous media. Naphthalene-degrading Pseudomonas putida G 7 cells {{were exposed to}} <b>glucose,</b> <b>salicylate,</b> and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and their motility was assessed by computer-assisted, quantitative swimming and capillary-based taxis determinations. Exposure to salicylate induced smooth movement with few acceleration events and positive taxis, whereas cells exposed to AgNPs exhibited tortuous movement and a repellent response. Although metabolized by strain G 7, glucose did not cause attraction and induced a hyper-motile mode of swimming, characterized by a high frequency of acceleration events, high swimming speed (> 60 μm s - 1), and a high tortuosity in the trajectories. Chemically induced motility behavior correlated with distinct modes of attachment to sand in batch assays and breakthrough curves in percolation column experiments. Salicylate significantly reduced deposition of G 7 cells in column experiments whereas glucose and AgNPs enhanced attachment and caused filter blocking {{that resulted in a}} progressive decrease in deposition. These findings are relevant for bioremediation scenarios that require an optimized outreach of introduced inoculants and in other environmental technologies, such as water disinfection and microbially enhanced oil recovery.

40|$|Plant-derived salicinoids (conjugates of <b>glucose</b> and <b>salicylate</b> {{phenolic}} moieties) are potent modulators of plant–herbivore interactions. We {{demonstrate the}} use of micro-high-performance liquid chromatography (μHPLC) with photodiode-array detection (DAD) for quantification of four salicinoids (salicin, salicortin, hydroxycyclohexen-on-oyl salicortin and tremulacin) in methanolic extracts of Populus...|$|R
40|$|The size-distribution {{of liver}} {{glycogen}} {{was shown to}} be distinctly affected by the anti-inflammatory drugs salicylate and indomethacin. By measurement of the incorporation of radioactive <b>glucose</b> into glycogen, <b>salicylate</b> was shown to have a depressing effect on overall liver glycogen metabolism. These effects appear to arise from the stabilizing of the lysosome by the drugs. The incorporation, via liposomes, of purified anti- 1, 4 -alpha-glucosidase activity and {{in the content of}} high-molecular-weight glycogen. These changes are increased by prolonged liposomal antibody treatment and suggest that a possible feedback control mechanism operates in the incorporation of glycogen into lysosomes. These experiments may be useful as a model of glycogen turnover and its failure in glycogenosis type II (Pompe's disease) ...|$|R
40|$|Sodium {{salicylate}} {{was administered}} to anesthetized dogs in doses sufficient to produce concentrations in plasma comparable to those common in human salicylate toxicity. Salicylate administration increased the rates of excretion of water, sodium, and chloride in the urine. Salicylate administration also increased the rate of excretion of potassium so that its clearance often exceeded that of creatinine. This enhancement of potassium excretion was dissociated from the alkalosis that accompanies salicyate toxicity. Administration of 5 % CO 2 in inspired gas did not attenuate the excretion of potassium; injection of salicylate into one renal artery caused a unilateral kaliuresis. Phosphate excretion increased progressively after administration of salicylate. On several occasions the clearance of phosphate equalled that of creatinine. Salicylate reduced renal tubular <b>glucose</b> reabsorption. When <b>salicylate</b> was injected into a renal artery, a glycosuria occurred ipsilaterally at filtered loads of glucose far below the reabsorptive capacity of the dog kidney. Salicylate administration also was associated with early elevation of glucose, phosphate, and potassium concentration in plasma. Salicylate administration reduced the content of adenosine triphosphate in the renal medulla. Salicylate was concentrated within the medulla between 1. 5 and 3 {{times that of the}} cortex, a gradient equal to that for chloride...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAnti-hyperglycaemic {{effects of}} the hydroxybenzoic acid {{salicylate}} might stem from {{effects of the}} drug on mitochondrial uncoupling, activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, and inhibition of NF-κB signalling. Here, we have gauged the contribution of these effects to control of hepatocyte <b>glucose</b> production, comparing <b>salicylate</b> with inactive hydroxybenzoic acid analogues of the drug. In rat H 4 IIE hepatoma cells, salicylate was the only drug tested that activated AMPK. Salicylate also reduced mTOR signalling, but this property was observed widely among the analogues. In a sub-panel of analogues, salicylate alone reduced promoter activity of the key gluconeogenic enzyme glucose 6 -phosphatase and suppressed basal glucose production in mouse primary hepatocytes. Both salicylate and 2, 6 dihydroxybenzoic acid suppressed TNFα-induced IκB degradation, and in genetic knockout experiments, {{we found that the}} effect of salicylate on IκB degradation was AMPK-independent. Previous data also identified AMPK-independent regulation of glucose but we found that direct inhibition of neither NF-κB nor mTOR signalling suppressed glucose production, suggesting that other factors besides these cell signalling pathways may need to be considered to account for this response to salicylate. We found, for example, that H 4 IIE cells were exquisitely sensitive to uncoupling with modest doses of salicylate, which occurred on a similar time course to another anti-hyperglycaemic uncoupling agent 2, 4 -dinitrophenol, while there was no discernible effect at all of two salicylate analogues which are not anti-hyperglycaemic. This finding supports much earlier literature suggesting that salicylates exert anti-hyperglycaemic effects at least in part through uncoupling...|$|R
