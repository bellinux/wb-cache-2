5|$|In 2016, Cyan Worlds {{released}} the Kickstarter-backed Obduction. While Obduction is not narratively linked to Myst, {{the game was}} considered by Rand Miller to be a spiritual successor to the Myst series, borrowing several of its themes and puzzle-design approaches, as well as incorporating <b>full-motion</b> <b>video</b> in homage to Myst. Robyn, who had left Cyan before this point, collaborated to help score the game and take {{on the role of}} one of the in-game characters.|$|E
5|$|From Exile onward, the {{characters}} of Myst were generally praised in each release. The live-action characters in the pre-rendered Myst titles were favorably received; Greg Kasavin of GameSpot said that the series' use of real actors and <b>full-motion</b> <b>video</b> endeared {{the characters}} to the player, giving the games a distinctively personal touch. Fellow Gamespot reviewer Scott Osborne stated the actors delivered convincing performances, and were smoothly incorporated into the game's scenes. The reviewers of G4tv, on the other hand, called the acting of the earlier installments overwrought and melodramatic.|$|E
5|$|The {{protagonist of}} Terra Nova is Nikola ap Io, the squad leader of Strike Force Centauri. His older brother, Brandt ap Io, {{is one of}} his subordinates, and the two share a mutual animosity. Other members of the squad include Sarah Walker, the {{daughter}} of a Centauri Council member; Ernest Schuyler, who is known for his sense of humor; and the frank and abrasive Simon Ashford. Each member was given a personality so that the player would form connections with the squad. Commander Arlen MacPherson assumes overall charge of the squad, and he has regular dealings with Hegemony ambassador Creon Pentheus. Live-action <b>full-motion</b> <b>video</b> cutscenes depicting character interaction occasionally play between missions.|$|E
50|$|The <b>full-motion</b> <b>videos</b> of Crash Twinsanity {{were created}} by Red Eye Studios, who {{previously}} created the <b>full-motion</b> <b>videos</b> for Crash Nitro Kart. The soundtrack of Crash Twinsanity was composed, performed, arranged and produced by an a cappella band Spiralmouth, while Gabriel Mann recorded and mixed the soundtrack at Asylum Recording Studios in Los Angeles.|$|R
50|$|This edition is {{a budget}} {{version of the}} game. It {{includes}} only 12 of the 24 levels in the full game, no <b>full-motion</b> <b>videos,</b> and no multiplayer mode. It does, however, show its award winning features on the front case like PC Gaming World Game of the Year, Game Informer game of the month and GameSpy's editor's choice.|$|R
50|$|The game {{is set in}} {{the year}} 2044 AD. Players assume the role of any one of six cyberpunks, each {{equipped}} with a unique car and a deadly supply of weapons. <b>Full-motion</b> <b>videos</b> of the racers are accessible in between races, in which each character flaunt their skills and insult their opponents with death threats. The game has rally and tournament modes designed for one player.|$|R
5|$|Killer Instinct Gold is a 1996 {{fighting}} {{video game}} {{based on the}} arcade game Killer Instinct2. The game was developed by Rare and released by Nintendo for the Nintendo64 video game console. As in other series entries, players control characters who fight on a 2D plane set against a 3D background. Players press buttons to punch and kick their opponent in chains of successive hits, known as combos. Large combo successions lead to stronger attacks and brutal, stylistic finisher moves underscored by an announcer. Charactersincluding a gargoyle, a ninja, and a femme fatalefight in settings such as a jungle and a spaceship. Killer Instinct Gold includes the arcade release's characters, combos, and 3D, pre-rendered environments, but excludes its <b>full-motion</b> <b>video</b> sequences and some voiceovers due to restrictions of the cartridge media format. The Gold release adds a training mode, new camera views, and improved audiovisuals.|$|E
5|$|In April 2015, Activision {{announced}} a new entry in the series, titled Guitar Hero Live. The title was developed by Activision's internal studio FreeStyleGames, who previously had worked on the DJ Hero spinoff titles. FreeStyleGames were given free rein to reboot the Guitar Hero series for next-generation consoles. One of their first innovations was to drop the standard five-button guitar controller, ultimately designing a six-button guitar controller, with two rows of three buttons each, allowing them to mimic actual guitar fingering. Guitar Hero Live was released with both a career and an online mode. The career mode used <b>full-motion</b> <b>video</b> taken {{from the perspective of}} a lead guitarist underneath the note highway, to create an immersive experience to the player. The online mode, called GHTV, discarded the previous downloadable content approach and used a music video channel approach to stream playable songs to players, adding new songs to the catalog on a weekly basis. The game was released in October 2015.|$|E
5|$|In the game's primary single-player mode, titled GH Live {{within the}} game, the player completes songs while {{experiencing}} <b>full-motion</b> <b>video</b> {{taken from the}} first-person perspective of a band's lead guitarist. The video includes shots of the audience and the band members. As the player performs the songs, the audience responds positively to good performances when few mistakes are made. If the player makes several mistakes in a row, the audience will become critical and start to jeer at the performer. To win back the crowd, the player can either match more notes correctly, or can use collected Hero Power to rapidly regain their interest. Hero Power, replacing Star Power from previous Guitar Hero games, is collected by correctly playing marked series of notes on the track; Hero Power can be accumulated, marked as on-screen guitar picks next to the track, to be used at later times. The player can release Hero Power for a limited time by either tilting the guitar controller upward or hitting a special button on the controller.|$|E
50|$|Zeljko Duvnjak {{served as}} the {{conceptual}} artist for Crash Tag Team Racing. The game's script was written by Chris Mitchell, with Jordan Reichek serving as a creative consultant. The <b>full-motion</b> <b>videos</b> were created by Red Eye Studios, who had previously animated the cutscenes for Crash Nitro Kart and Twinsanity. The environments of the game were built by Sarah Meagher and Vincent Chin, while the vehicles were built by Kevin Fink.|$|R
50|$|Desktop video {{refers to}} a {{phenomenon}} lasting from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s when the graphics capabilities of personal computers such as Commodore's Amiga, the Apple Macintosh II and specially-upgraded IBM PC compatibles had advanced {{to the point where}} individuals and local broadcasters could use them for analog non-linear editing (NLE) and vision mixing in video production. Despite the use of computers, desktop video {{should not be confused with}} digital video since the video data remained analog. Full-screen, <b>full-motion</b> <b>video's</b> vast storage requirements meant that the promise of digital encoding would not be realized on desktop computers for at least another decade.|$|R
50|$|Game Boy Advance Video was {{a format}} for putting full color, <b>full-motion</b> <b>videos</b> onto Game Boy Advance {{cartridges}}. These videos are playable using the Game Boy Advance system's screen and sound hardware. These video cartridges were manufactured by Majesco Entertainment, {{except for the}} Pok√©mon Game Boy Advance Video cartridges, which were published by Nintendo. The cartridges themselves were developed by 4Kids Entertainment's subsidiary 4Kids Technology, Inc. The video cartridges are colored white for easy identification and are sold as Game Boy Advance Video Paks. The Game Boy Advance Video game paks offer the same 240x160 resolution as standard Game Boy Advance games.|$|R
5|$|Miyamoto {{wanted to}} make a game that was cinematic, yet {{distinguished}} from actual films. Takumi Kawagoe, who creates cutscenes for Nintendo, says that his top priority is to have the player feel in control of the action. To promote this instantaneous continuity of cinematic gameplay, the cutscenes in Ocarina of Time are completely generated with real-time computing on the Nintendo 64 console and do not use prerendered <b>full-motion</b> <b>video.</b> Miyamoto's vision required this real-time architecture for the total of more than 90 minutes of cutscenes, regardless of whether the console had a vast medium like CD-ROM on which to store prerendered versions. Toru Osawa created the scenario for the game, based on a story idea by Miyamoto and Yoshiaki Koizumi. He was given support by A Link to the Past and Link's Awakening script writer Kensuke Tanabe. Miyamoto said the real-time rendering engine allowed his small team of 3 to 7 cinematic developers to rapidly adjust the storyline and to focus on developing additional gameplay elements even up to the final few months of development, instead of waiting on a repeated prerendering process. The dungeons were designed by Eiji Aonuma.|$|E
25|$|The first {{interactive}} movie {{game was}} Nintendo's Wild Gunman, a 1974 electro-mechanical arcade game that used film reel projection to display live-action <b>full-motion</b> <b>video</b> (FMV) footage of Wild West gunslingers. In the 1970s, Kasco (Kansei Seiki Seisakusho) released a hit electro-mechanical arcade game with live-action FMV, projecting car footage filmed by Toei.|$|E
25|$|Developers also {{experimented with}} laserdisc players for {{delivering}} full motion video based games with movie-quality animation. The first laserdisc video game to exploit this technology was 1983's Astron Belt from Sega, soon followed by Dragon's Lair from Cinematronics; {{the latter was}} a sensation when it was released (and, in fact, the laserdisc players in many machines broke due to overuse). While laserdisc games were usually either shooter games with <b>full-motion</b> <b>video</b> backdrops like Astron Belt or interactive movies like Dragon's Lair, Data East's 1983 game Bega's Battle introduced {{a new form of}} video game storytelling: using brief <b>full-motion</b> <b>video</b> cutscenes to develop a story between the game's shooting stages, which would years later become the standard approach to video game storytelling. By the mid-1980s, the genre dwindled in popularity, as laserdiscs were losing out to the VHS format and the laserdisc games themselves were losing their novelty, due to their linearity and, in many cases, depending less on reflexes than on memorizing sequences of moves.|$|E
5000|$|The {{graphics}} received mixed responses. Kasavin {{said the}} game [...] "looks decent but, ultimately, {{not all that}} good". He criticized the bland environments and awkward movements for enemy units and the playable character, but praised {{the design of the}} dragon. Game Informer was more positive, praising the graphical detail and cutscenes and the look of enemy units, despite finding pop-up issues and framerate dips. Jarvis praised the design of the main cast, but cited the repetitive enemy design and dark environments as detracting elements. Dunham praised the character and monster designs as well as the full-motion cutscenes, but was less impressed by the repetitive human enemy designs, bland environments and low draw distance. The <b>full-motion</b> <b>videos</b> were also praised by the CVG reviewer.|$|R
50|$|The plot {{begins as}} the robotic hero Mega Man {{is called to}} {{investigate}} a mysterious energy reading coming from a recent meteor crash on an island. Mega Man discovers that his nemesis Dr. Wily has beaten him there and immediately retreats with the energy source. Mega Man is charged with stopping Wily's evil {{plans to use the}} energy, as well as discover the purpose of a mysterious, alien robot found at the crash site. Along with new animated <b>full-motion</b> <b>videos</b> (FMVs) and voice acting, Mega Man 8 features improved graphics and sound when compared to previous iterations in the series. Aside from a few minor conventions, the game utilizes the same 2D side-scrolling and platforming formula established by its predecessors on the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super Nintendo Entertainment Systems.|$|R
5000|$|While the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows ports were {{essentially}} the same, the Nintendo 64 version saw {{a handful of}} minor changes. Given the limited storage capacity of the N64's cartridge system, all <b>full-motion</b> <b>videos</b> were removed. Brief segments of scrolling text are used at the game's start and following each level to advance the plot. The platforming elements were made much easier in the N64 version, and the health-depleting adrenaline meter could also be turned off in the options menu, allowing players to explore the environments at a more leisurely pace. According to IGN, control-wise [...] "everything does feel improved over the PlayStation version." [...] Also graphically, the N64 version of Nightmare Creatures looked more crisp, clear and detailed than the PlayStation version, without the pixelization and texture-warping.|$|R
25|$|Initial {{adventure}} games {{developed in}} the 1970s and early 1980s were text-based, using text parsers to translate the player's input into commands. As personal computers became more powerful {{with the ability to}} show graphics, the graphic adventure game format became popular, initially by augmenting player's text commands with graphics, but soon moving towards point and click interfaces. Further computer advancements led to adventure games with more immersive graphics using real-time or pre-rendered three-dimensional scenes or <b>full-motion</b> <b>video</b> taken from the first- or third-person perspective.|$|E
25|$|Following , Kojima {{produced}} {{his next}} graphic adventure, Policenauts (1994), a point-and-click adventure notable {{for being an}} early example of extensive voice recording in video games. It also featured a hard science fiction setting, a theme revolving around space exploration, a plot inspired by the ancient Japanese tale of Urashima Taro, and some occasional <b>full-motion</b> <b>video</b> cut scenes. The gameplay was largely similar to Snatcher, but {{with the addition of}} a point-and-click interface and some first-person shooter segments. Policenauts also introduced summary screens, which act to refresh the player's memory of the plot upon reloading a save, an element Kojima would later use in Metal Gear Solid.|$|E
25|$|The {{next major}} {{revolution}} {{came in the}} late 1990s, which saw the rise of optical disks in fifth generation consoles. The implications for RPGs were enormous‚Äîlonger, more involved quests, better audio, and <b>full-motion</b> <b>video.</b> This was first clearly demonstrated in 1997 by the phenomenal success of Final Fantasy VII, which {{is considered one of}} the most influential games of all time. With a record-breaking production budget of around $45 million, the ambitious scope of Final Fantasy VII raised the possibilities for the genre, with its dozens of minigames and much higher production values. The latter includes innovations such as the use of 3D characters on pre-rendered backgrounds, battles viewed from multiple different angles rather than a single angle, and for the first time full-motion CGI video seamlessly blended into the gameplay, effectively integrated throughout the game. The game was soon ported to the PC and gained much success there, as did several other originally console RPGs, blurring the line between the console and computer platforms.|$|E
500|$|SaGa Frontier 2 {{was first}} {{announced}} in a September 1998 issue of Japanese The PlayStation magazine, where Square claimed the game {{would be taking}} a stylistic departure from the original SaGa Frontier released one year earlier, as well as confirming the title's release for spring 1999. A representative from the company stated {{that they would be}} abandoning the CG <b>full-motion</b> <b>videos</b> and computer-style graphics of the previous title to focus on a more traditional, hand-drawn look. The game's art style was achieved by using hand-drawn and painted artwork produced on a canvas that would be scanned and digitized to produce the game's backgrounds and character sprites. [...] Many of the game's towns, locations, and characters draw heavily from medieval Germanic influence, with much of the story taking place within a fictional time-frame similar to the 13th century. New features not seen in the previous SaGa Frontier title include compatibility with the PlayStation's DualShock analog controller and PocketStation peripheral device for accessing additional content.|$|R
5000|$|The Legend of Dragoon was {{developed}} by Sony Computer Entertainment of Japan (SCEI). The project began in 1996 {{with a small group}} of people while the company simultaneously built teams for developing other games such as Ape Escape and Ico. At its peak, the development team consisted of over 100 members, with ten people simply dedicated to drawing the game's concept art. As the game contains a large number of pre-rendered maps and <b>full-motion</b> <b>videos,</b> content was spread over four discs. The Legend of Dragoon took three and a half years to develop before its December 1999 release in Japan. Prior to its June 2000 release in North America, the gameplay was rebalanced following complaints of the Japanese version's difficulty level. According to Shuhei Yoshida, The Legend of Dragoon cost Sony Computer Entertainment $16 million to develop in over a span of three years and that most of the game's sales were made overseas, saying [...] "the sales in the U.S. were very strong." ...|$|R

25|$|Others tried new {{concepts}} and defined new genres. Rapidly evolving hardware allowed {{new kinds of}} games which allowed for different styles of gameplay. In 1980, Namco released Pac-Man, which popularized the maze chase genre, and Rally-X, which featured a radar tracking the player position on the map. Games such as the pioneering 1981 games Donkey Kong and Qix in 1981 introduced new types of games where skill and timing {{are more important than}} shooting as fast as possible, with Nintendo's Donkey Kong in particular setting the template for the platform game genre. Namco's Bosconian in 1981 introduced a free-roaming style of gameplay where the player's ship freely moves across open space, while also including a radar tracking player & enemy positions. Bega's Battle in 1983 introduced a new form of video game storytelling: using brief <b>full-motion</b> <b>video</b> cutscenes to develop a story between the game's shooting stages. Other examples of innovative games are Atari Games' Paperboy in 1984 where the goal is to successfully deliver newspapers to customers, and Namco's Phozon where the object is to duplicate a shape shown {{in the middle of the}} screen. The theme of Exidy's Venture is dungeon exploration and treasure-gathering. One innovative game, Q*Bert, played upon the user's sense of depth perception to deliver a novel experience.|$|E
25|$|The first Tomb Raider used a {{custom-built}} game engine, {{as other}} equivalent engines available to Core Design {{at the time}} were not versatile enough to realise the team's vision. The engine was designed by Paul Douglas, who also handled the game's artificial intelligence (AI) and the three-dimensional (3D) graphics. The choice of a 3D game was influenced by the team's opinion that the game type was under-represented when compared to first-person shooters such as Doom. Its 3D style meant multiple elements were difficult to implement, including the AI and camera control. Another noted aspect was the multi-layered levels, as compared to equivalent 3D action-adventure games of the time which were limited to a flat-floor system. Lara's movements were hand-animated and coordinated rather than created using motion capture. The reason for this was that the team wanted uniformity in her movement, which was not possible with motion capture technology of the time. For Tomb Raider II, only minor upgrades were made to the engine, with the main improvements being to the AI and smoothing out Lara's model. Tomb Raider III underwent major revisions, including rewrites to the graphics engine and improvements in the lighting and AI systems. The engine was given a major overhaul for The Last Revelation. The first five games make use of <b>full-motion</b> <b>video</b> cutscenes. For the first three games, they were primarily used as transitional periods depicting Lara moving from one level to another or one location to another. For Chronicles, fairly minor revisions were made.|$|E
25|$|The {{next major}} {{revolution}} {{came in the}} mid-to-late 1990s, which saw the rise of 3D computer graphics and optical discs in fifth generation consoles. The implications for RPGs were enormous‚Äîlonger, more involved quests, better audio, and <b>full-motion</b> <b>video.</b> This was clearly demonstrated in 1997 by the phenomenal success of Final Fantasy VII, which {{is considered one of}} the most influential games of all time, akin to that of Star Wars in the movie industry. With a record-breaking production budget of around $45 million, the ambitious scope of Final Fantasy VII raised the possibilities for the genre, with its more expansive world to explore, much longer quest, more numerous sidequests, dozens of minigames, and much higher production values. The latter includes innovations such as the use of 3D characters on pre-rendered backgrounds, battles viewed from multiple different angles rather than a single angle, and for the first time full-motion CGI video seamlessly blended into the gameplay, effectively integrated throughout the game. Gameplay innovations included the materia system, which allowed a considerable amount of customization and flexibility through materia that can be combined in many different ways and exchanged between characters at any time, and the limit breaks, special attacks that can be performed after a character's limit meter fills up by taking hits from opponents. The materia system is similar to, but more sophisticated than, the slotted item system in Diablo II (2000). Final Fantasy VII continues to be listed among the best games of all time, for its highly polished gameplay, high playability, lavish production, well-developed characters, intricate storyline, and an emotionally engaging narrative that is much darker and sophisticated than most other RPGs. The game's storytelling and character development was considered a major narrative jump forward for video games and was often compared to films and novels at the time.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} {{designs were}} done by Senri Kita, an artist {{new to the}} series. In contrast to previous Fire Emblem games, where the protagonist was of royal blood, the main character Ike {{was intended to be}} of lower social rank, a mercenary who becomes involved in royal politics and conflict rather than being born into it. Ike was born from the many ideas for new directions being suggested for the new 3D game, with many people wanting the protagonist everyone could empathize with. His status as a mercenary was a highly requested character trait by male staff. A character that returned from previous games was Jeigan, who was this time designed as a female character. Designing all the characters to be unique under the new conditions proved a challenge. This also resulted in higher-quality character artwork being produced during the initial design stages. The <b>full-motion</b> <b>videos</b> were created by Japanese animation studio Digital Frontier. Introducing the cutscenes into the game proved challenging for the team.
