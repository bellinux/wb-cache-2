500|$|Giving {{the film}} only the tagline [...] "A love {{story in the}} city of dreams", David Lynch has refused to comment on Mulholland Drives meaning or symbolism, leading to much {{discussion}} and multiple interpretations. The Christian Science Monitor film critic David Sterritt spoke with Lynch after the film screened at Cannes and wrote that the director [...] "insisted that Mulholland Drive does tell a coherent, comprehensible story", unlike some of Lynch's earlier films like Lost Highway. On the other hand, Justin Theroux said of Lynch's feelings on the multiple meanings people perceive in the film, [...] "I think he's genuinely happy for it to mean anything you want. <b>He</b> <b>loves</b> <b>it</b> when people come up with really bizarre interpretations. David works from his subconscious." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Slow Dance" [...] {{was written}} with Hilson {{alongside}} American recording artist Justin Timberlake, {{as well as}} Johnkenum D. Spivery and Timbaland protégés The Royal Court and Jim Beanz. According to Hilson, the songs were first in the works with fellow Timbaland collaborator Justin Timberlake in 2006, during FutureSex/LoveSounds era, but she commented, [...] "it was still unofficial then.

He later adds, [...] "I just want to watch the moon glisten off your body... I really just want to peel you out dem clothes and show you how excited I am to lay you down right now." [...] The remix was well received by music critics. A writer of Vibe magazine commented that it [...] "is sultry and will steam up any club, bedroom or wherever you like to get dirty". A writer of Rap-Up magazine described the remix as [...] "amazing", adding that [...] "he bedroom will be banging to this remix". Similarly, X. Alexander of the website Idolator praised the remix, writing that T.I.'s vocals make the [...] "smooth, bedroom-ready R track that much sexier".|$|E

But <b>he</b> went to take charge of it, to {{preserve}} it. It was as an old, sacred thing to him. He looked after the stone and woodwork, mending the organ and restoring a piece of broken carving, repairing the church furniture. Later, he became choir-master also.|$|R
2500|$|Regina (Lana Parrilla) and Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) {{are going}} through Regina's stores of potions in her vault and cannot find {{something}} that will unfreeze Marian. [...] Henry surmises that Robin Hood is {{still in love with}} Regina because true love's kiss did not unfreeze her. Regina says that this time Henry may be too young to fully understand everything. Hook walks Emma home and at the door to the loft they share a kiss after Emma jokingly invites him in for coffee with her parents. During the kiss Hook notices his left hand again acting aggressively. Emma walks inside and has a moment when she seems to realize Hook's hand's actions and has a brief conversation with her parents. Hook runs into a drunk Will Scarlet trying to break into the library and punches him in the face when Will refuses to stop. Hook again is put off by his hand controlling his actions and tells Will that if he informs anyone of what happened he will be a dead man. As Mr. Gold is preparing to go home in his car with flowers Hook enters the passenger door and tells Mr. Gold to replace his hand with the hook. He refuses, saying Hook should've heeded his warnings. Hook threatens to inform Belle (Emilie de Ravin) of the dagger, but Gold then tells Hook that he has swapped the daggers and that Belle has the actual dagger. Mr. Gold says he will replace the Hook once Hook does a favor for him. He refuses to give Hook a definite date or time and Hook states he {{can find a way to}} remove it without magic. Mr. Gold tells Hook that since his magic restored the hand, only his magic can take it off. Enraged, Hook thrusts the hook into Gold's chest. Mr. Gold is unharmed, stating he would have thought Hook would have learned the first time he tried to kill Rumplestiltskin. Hook states that it wasn't him that did that, and Mr. Gold states that the next time he may harm someone else who he cares about. Hook states he will do whatever it takes and Mr. Gold says that <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>it</b> when people say that. He tells Hook to meet him on the docks in the morning.|$|E

60|$|For {{if a man}} loves, he {{longs to}} help those whom <b>he</b> <b>loves.</b> <b>It</b> is {{the very essence of}} love, that it cannot be still, cannot be idle, cannot be {{satisfied}} with itself, cannot contain itself, but must go out to do good to those whom it loves, to seek and to save that which is lost. And therefore God is perfect love, and his eternal life a life of eternal love, because he sends his Son eternally to seek and to save that which is lost.|$|E

If there is anything <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>it</b> is maple sugar, so when he smelled the syrup he pulled down the kettle and the hot syrup went all over his nose.

A great man scarcely knows how he dines, how he dresses; but without railing or precision his living is natural and poetic. John Eliot, the Indian Apostle, drank water, and said of wine,--"It is a noble, generous liquor {{and we should be}} humbly thankful for it, but, as I remember, water was made before it." [...] Better still is the temperance of King David, who poured out on the ground unto the Lord the water which three of his warriors had brought him to drink, at the peril of their lives.|$|E
