50|$|The Kunze-Knorr brake (Kunze-Knorr-Bremse or KK-Bremse) is an {{automatic}} compressed-air brake for goods, passenger and express trains. It {{was the first}} graduated brake for goods trains in Europe. When it was introduced after the First World War, goods train brakes switched from hand operation to compressed-air in various European countries. The Deutsche Reichsbahn alone put the cost of equipping German goods wagons with Kunze-Knorr brakes between 1918 and 1927 at 478.4 million Reichsmarks. The operating cost savings from <b>faster</b> <b>goods</b> <b>services</b> and having fewer brakemen was assessed by the Reichsbahn at almost 96.3 million Reichsmark annually.|$|R
50|$|The LSWR was {{merged into}} the Southern Railway in 1923. By then {{services}} {{had been reduced}} even further. There were now 6 or 8 services a day, mainly formed of 2- or 3-coach trains hauled by Drummond M7 tank engines, with T9s remaining for <b>faster</b> <b>services.</b> <b>Goods</b> <b>services</b> remained vital to the line, with a twice-daily service - one trip south-bound and one north-bound. Wagons and trucks would be shunted into the train at the three goods yards by the locomotive.|$|R
50|$|Some of the {{preserved}} examples have {{stars on}} their cabsides {{indicating that they}} have specially balanced wheelsets/motion. This practice began {{under the auspices of}} British Railways, to denote that locomotives thus treated were able to work <b>fast,</b> vacuum-braked <b>goods</b> <b>services.</b> Other members of the class have a yellow stripe on the cab meaning that they weren't permitted to run south of Crewe as the WCML south of Crewe had been electrified with overhead wires.|$|R
2500|$|Although it {{had been}} built to work the Western line to Ararat, a number of bridges along the route {{required}} strengthening before the H class locomotive with its 23¼ ton axle load could enter regular service on that line. The necessary work was deferred due to wartime restrictions on available resources. Therefore, H220 was put {{to work on the}} only line able to accommodate its loading gauge and high axle load, the North-Eastern line to Albury, where it hauled express passenger <b>services,</b> <b>fast</b> <b>goods</b> <b>services,</b> troop trains, and on the odd occasion when the regular S class Pacific was not available, the Spirit of Progress, particularly in the postwar period when S class locomotives were affected by poor coal and reduced availability. H220 gave an indication of its capabilities on one such run of the Spirit in the late 1940s by reportedly topping the [...] long 1 in 50 Glenroy Bank at [...] (three times the typical S class-hauled speed at this point,) going on to pass Seymour 13 minutes ahead of schedule and arriving at Albury at 20 minutes ahead of the 10:40 pm scheduled arrival time.|$|R
5000|$|In July 1977, {{three cars}} were {{transferred}} across to standard gauge for <b>fast,</b> mixed <b>goods</b> <b>services.</b> Cars 780, 781 and 782 became BF cars 343, 344 and 345 respectively. The BF code {{was defined as}} [...] "non-airconditioned economy class sitting car with cooking facilities". It is not clear where any such cooking facilities may have been constructed, but they may have taken over the space previously allocated to the short (3-window) saloon. The cars were repainted into red with a tan roof, black undergear and silver stripes to match the scheme of the short-haul Commonwealth Railways passenger stock.|$|R
5000|$|To meet {{demands for}} a <b>faster</b> part-load <b>goods</b> <b>service,</b> the {{high-speed}} [...] "Gs Oppeln" [...] class vans were built from 1937 in series. By designing it with a wheelbase of 6,000 mm, outer longitudinal beams and 7 leaf, 1,400-mm-long suspension springs the van {{was able to be}} rated for a top speed of 90 km/h. The wagons had no handbrake, a length over buffers of 9,100 mm, a loading volume of 45 m³, a payload of 15 tonnes and a carrying capacity of 17.5 tonnes. They had a pointed underframe (spitz zulaufendes Sprengwerk) and were fitted with a Hildebrandt-Knorr air brake.|$|R
50|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, it {{embarked}} on a programme of electrifying the suburban routes, at 600 V DC using a third rail. Eventually this covered the entire suburban area. Freight traffic, especially from the West Country was important, but the emphasis on suburban electrification led to weaker development of steam traction for <b>fast</b> passenger and <b>goods</b> <b>services</b> to Devon and Cornwall, and to Portsmouth, Bournemouth and Weymouth.|$|R
