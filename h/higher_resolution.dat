5|$|The PC {{version of}} the game hosts several {{exclusive}} features, such as improved graphics, <b>higher</b> <b>resolution</b> options, more characters onscreen, improved draw distance, optional Japanese dialogue, and improved enemy AI. However, it does not contain the additional content from Dynasty Warriors 4: Xtreme Legends.|$|E
5|$|Electron {{microscopy}} {{offers a}} <b>higher</b> <b>resolution</b> image. In an electron microscope, {{a beam of}} focused electrons interacts with the sample rather than {{a beam of light}} as in traditional microscopy. In conjunction with rapid freezing techniques, electron microscopy has also been used to study the mechanisms of inter- and intracellular transport, for instance in demonstrating that exocytotic vesicles are the means of chemical release at synapses.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} version, Yumemi is only voiced during {{the beginning and}} ending scenes, while other characters are not voiced. When Planetarian was released for Windows PCs on CD-ROM, Yumemi had full voice acting. The PlayStation 2 (PS2) port offers full voice acting for the entire cast. Other changes to the PS2 version include a <b>higher</b> <b>resolution</b> for the computer graphics and an extended soundtrack. All other later versions contained full voice acting.|$|E

5|$|After {{the release}} of the Pocket PC version, in 2006 Chahi created a new Windows version {{targeted}} at Windows XP. Emmanuel Rivoire increased the resolution to 1280×800 pixels and Chahi created more detailed backgrounds. He found that his original choice to use polygons for the game characters enabled him to use the original character art at a <b>higher</b> <b>resolution.</b> The game still supports the original 320×200 resolution, as well as the original background art (as an option), and it features twice as many checkpoints as the original, which makes it somewhat easier, as well as newly remixed sounds.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} a low-maintenance {{experiment}} was the protein crystal growth experiment, which had also been flown on previous shuttle missions. The goal was to produce better protein crystallizations than those produced on the Earth, and hence allowing for a more accurate model of protein structures. Of the 23 proteins and viruses attempted during Expedition 1, only four resulted in successful crystallizations, which was a lower success rate than predicted. Of those successful was the low-calorie sweetener Thaumatin, whose crystals diffracted at a <b>higher</b> <b>resolution</b> than Earth-grown crystal, {{which resulted in a}} more accurate protein structure model.|$|E

40|$|The SeaWinds {{instrument}} on the QuikSCAT satellite {{was designed}} to measure near surface winds over the ocean at a nominal resolution of 25 km with daily global coverage. Recently, reconstruction and resolution enhancement algorithms have been applied to the QuikSCAT measurements to generate <b>high</b> <b>resolution</b> backscatter fields. These <b>high</b> <b>resolution</b> fields {{make it possible to}} retrieve the wind at <b>higher</b> spatial <b>resolution.</b> Substantially finer wind and rain features are evident in the dense wind fields. The tradeoff is a higher noise level in the estimated winds. This paper describes the <b>high</b> <b>resolution</b> wind retrieval approach and the accuracy of the resulting <b>high</b> <b>resolution</b> winds. The limitations of the <b>high</b> <b>resolution</b> winds are considered. Methods for improving the accuracy of the data are presented...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} approaches <b>high</b> <b>resolution</b> scatterometry {{from a new}} perspective. Three related general {{topics are}} addressed: <b>high</b> <b>resolution</b> σ 0 imaging, wind estimation from <b>high</b> <b>resolution</b> σ 0 images over the ocean, and <b>high</b> <b>resolution</b> wind estimation directly from the scatterometer measurements. Theories of each topic are developed, and previous approaches are generalized and formalized. Improved processing algorithms for these theories are developed, implemented for particular scatterometers, and analyzed. Specific results and contributions are noted below. The σ 0 imaging problem is approached as the inversion of a noisy aperture-filtered sampling operation–extending the current theory to deal explicitly with noise. A maximum aposteriori (MAP) reconstruction estimator is developed to regularize the problem and deal appropriately with noise. The method {{is applied to the}} SeaWinds scatterometer and the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT). The MAP approach produces <b>high</b> <b>resolution</b> σ 0 images without introducing the ad-hoc processing steps employed in previous methods. An ultra <b>high</b> <b>resolution</b> (UHR) wind product has been previously developed and shown to produce valuable <b>high</b> <b>resolution</b> information, but the theory has not been formalized.

The field has also been surveyed with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope and the MERLIN array of radio telescopes at 1.4GHz; the combination of VLA and MERLIN maps made at wavelengths of 3.5 and 20cm have located 16 radio sources in the HDF-N field, with many more in the flanking fields. Radio images of some individual sources in the field have been made with the European VLBI Network at 1.6GHz with a <b>higher</b> <b>resolution</b> than the Hubble maps.|$|E
5|$|Perfect Dark is a remastered {{release of}} the first-person shooter video game by the same name. Developed by 4J Studios and {{published}} by Microsoft Game Studios {{a decade after the}} original's 2000 release, the remaster features several technical improvements, including <b>higher</b> <b>resolution</b> textures and models, a higher frame rate, and a multiplayer mode that supports the Xbox Live online service. It was released for the Xbox 360 video game console in March 2010, through the Xbox Live Arcade download service. The story of the game follows Joanna Dark, an agent of the Carrington Institute organization, as she attempts to stop a conspiracy by rival corporation dataDyne.|$|E
5|$|The HDMI {{specification}} {{defines the}} protocols, signals, electrical interfaces and mechanical {{requirements of the}} standard. The maximum pixel clock rate for HDMI 1.0 is 165MHz, which is sufficient to allow 1080p and WUXGA (1920×1200) at 60Hz. HDMI 1.3 increases that to 340MHz, which allows for <b>higher</b> <b>resolution</b> (such as WQXGA, 2560×1600) across a single digital link. An HDMI connection can either be single-link (type A/C/D) or dual-link (type B) and can have a video pixel rate of 25MHz to 340MHz (for a single-link connection) or 25MHz to 680MHz (for a dual-link connection). Video formats with rates below 25MHz (e.g., 13.5MHz for 480i/NTSC) are transmitted using a pixel-repetition scheme.|$|E

5|$|Day of the Tentacle Remastered {{retains its}} {{two-dimensional}} cartoon-style art, redrawn at <b>higher</b> <b>resolution</b> for modern computers. The high resolution character art was updated {{by a team}} led by Yujin Keim with consultation of Ahern and Chan. Keim's team used many of the original sketches of characters and assets from the two and emulated their style with improvements for modern graphics systems. Matt Hanson worked on recreating the background assets in high resolution. As with the Grim Fandango remaster, the player can switch {{back and forth between the}} original graphics and the high-resolution version. The game includes a more streamlined interaction menu, a command wheel akin to the approach used in Broken Age, but the player can opt to switch back to the original interface. The game's soundtrack has been redone within MIDI adapted to work with the iMUSE system. There is an option to listen to commentary from the original creators, including Schafer, Grossman, Chan, McConnell, Ahern, and Bajakian. The remaster contains the fully playable version of the original Maniac Mansion, though no enhancements have been made to that game-within-a-game.|$|E
5|$|During the Mission Status briefing, Lead Flight Director Tony Ceccacci {{noted that}} during the camera survey of the {{equipment}} in the payload bay, the team noticed some fine particulate matter around the box containing the Wide Field Camera 3 and asked the crew to take additional images using a <b>higher</b> <b>resolution</b> camera for the ground teams to assess. Cain later confirmed that the dust was not present prior to launch, and was most likely particulate shaken loose from the thick insulation blankets inside the payload bay during launch. The team advised the crew to avoid the particulate {{as much as possible}} during the spacewalks, and use caution when working around the container to avoid the debris, {{but it was not a}} significant concern.|$|E
5|$|Nidhogg is a side-scrolling two-player {{fighting}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Messhof. Players duel with swords in a pixelated environment. The game was commissioned for the New York University Game Center's annual multiplayer show, and was revised and demoed at private events {{over the next four}} years before its final release. It won Indiecade 2013's Game Design award and the 2011 Independent Games Festival's Nuovo award. It was released for Microsoft Windows on January 13, 2014, and later ported to OS X, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita. Critics praised the feel of the gameplay and its balance, but considered its single-player mode unsatisfying. Messhof released a sequel in 2017 with a <b>higher</b> <b>resolution</b> art style and additional weapons and arenas.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the overall quality}} of IUE <b>high</b> <b>resolution</b> data processed with the NEWSIPS software in terms of flux and wavelength accuracy. It also describes the processing of NEWSIPS <b>high</b> <b>resolution</b> spectra {{within the framework of the}} ESA "IUE Newly. Extracted Spectra" (INES) System. This system provides the IUE <b>high</b> <b>resolution</b> data in two formats: the <b>high</b> <b>resolution</b> "concatenated" spectra: in which the spectral orders are connected; eliminating the overlap regions through a procedure designed to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio at the edges of the orders, and the "rebinned" spectra, i. e. the <b>high</b> <b>resolution</b> concatenated spectra resampled into the low resolution wavelength domain. Our study reveals the existence of a significant discrepancy in the wavelength scales of short and long wavelength NEWSIPS <b>high</b> <b>resolution</b> spectra. The INES processing applies a correction of + 17. 7 km s(- 1) to the wavelength scale of the <b>high</b> <b>resolution</b> SWP spectra in order to provide an internally consistent velocity scale. Similarly, suitable corrections have been applied to long wavelength small aperture spectra. The new wavelength scale is, within the error:;, in good agreement with the optical velocity scale...|$|R
5|$|Only 403 (45 percent) of {{the total}} number of sorties flown by Fighter Command were {{directed}} at the three major German raids. A further 56 (or just over 6 per cent) were standing patrols to protect shipping off the coast. Most of the remaining 427 sorties (nearly 50 per cent) were made to engage the reconnaissance aircraft. Usually several half-squadrons were committed. This was not excessive. But by sending more units to counter the flights, German aircraft were forced to fly higher and were denied the opportunity to drop to low altitude to take <b>higher</b> <b>resolution</b> photographs. This contributed to a lack of German intelligence which often failed to distinguish fighter, bomber and naval airfields from each other. Much of the time their strength was directed at non-fighter airfields on this date.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil 3 was {{released}} for the Microsoft Windows and Dreamcast platforms in 2000, featuring enhanced 3D character models and <b>higher</b> <b>resolution</b> graphics. The Dreamcast version includes more alternate costumes {{than in the}} PlayStation version. Critical reception for these ports was not as positive. The Microsoft Windows version was criticized for not being optimized for keyboard and mouse and for not letting players save their progress at any time. Critics noted {{that some of the}} pre-rendered backgrounds in the Dreamcast version of the game were not improved, resulting in them looking not as good as the PlayStation version's due to the Dreamcast's higher graphic fidelity. CVC generally praised the Dreamcast version, but admitted that the difference in graphical quality between Resident Evil 3 and Code: Veronica was very large.|$|E
5|$|Two {{regions of}} smooth plains were {{observed}} by Voyager 2. They generally have low relief and have far fewer craters {{than in the}} cratered terrains, indicating a relatively young surface age. In one of the smooth plain regions, Sarandib Planitia, no impact craters were visible down to the limit of resolution. Another region of smooth plains to the southwest of Sarandib is criss-crossed by several troughs and scarps. Cassini has since viewed these smooth plains regions, like Sarandib Planitia and Diyar Planitia at much <b>higher</b> <b>resolution.</b> Cassini images show these regions filled with low-relief ridges and fractures, probably caused by shear deformation. The high-resolution images of Sarandib Planitia revealed {{a number of small}} impact craters, which allow for an estimate of the surface age, either 170 million years or 3.7 billion years, depending on assumed impactor population.|$|E
