5|$|In Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, the Green Knight appears before Arthur's court {{during a}} Christmas feast, holding a bough of holly <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> battle axe in the other. Despite {{disclaim}} of war, the knight issues a challenge: he will allow one man to strike him once with his axe, {{with the condition}} that he return the blow the next year. At first, Arthur accepts the challenge, but Gawain takes his place and decapitates the Green Knight, who retrieves his head, reattaches it and tells Gawain {{to meet him at}} the Green Chapel at the stipulated time.|$|E
5|$|The {{first wave}} {{departed}} Guam at 23:43. As {{the second wave}} landed, Major Siad arrived at the embassy gate accompanied by two truckloads of soldiers and held a grenade <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> radio in the other. His request {{to speak with the}} ambassador was granted. Major Siad demanded that the evacuation cease immediately because the Somali government had not granted the US permission to carry out such a military operation. He claimed that he would radio soldiers to shoot down the helicopters if the operation continued. The second and third waves were able to depart without incident as the ambassador negotiated with the Major, who finally agreed to settle the matter for several thousand dollars in cash and keys to the ambassador's armored car. Ambassador Bishop remained engaged in conversation with the Major until he reached the helicopter landing zone to depart with the final wave to prevent the Major from reneging on the deal. The final wave departed the embassy at 1:49 and landed on Guam at 2:23; twenty minutes later, Ambassador Bishop declared the evacuation complete.|$|E
5|$|The {{relation}} {{of church and}} state in Zwingli's mind is best represented in a statue by the Wasserkirche, where he stands with a Bible <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> sword in the other. For him, the church and state are one under the sovereign rule of God. The development of the complex relationship between church and state in Zwingli's view can only be understood by examining the context of his life, the city of Zürich, and the wider Swiss Confederation. His earliest writings before he became a reformer, such as The Ox (1510) and The Labyrinth (1516), reveal a patriotic love of his land, a longing for liberty, and opposition to the mercenary service where young Swiss citizens were sent to fight in foreign wars for the financial benefit of the state government. His life as a parish priest and an army chaplain helped to develop his concern for morality and justice. He saw his ministry not limited to a private sphere, but to the people as a whole.|$|E

25|$|After Brunel's {{death the}} {{decision}} was taken that standard gauge {{should be used for}} all railways in the country. At the original Welsh terminus of the Great Western railway at Neyland, sections of the broad gauge rails are used as handrails at the quayside, and a number of information boards there depict various aspects of Brunel's life. There is also a larger than life bronze statue of him holding a steamship <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> locomotive in the other. The statue has been replaced after an earlier theft.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, the {{reported}} Marian apparitions of Our Lady of Lourdes gathered significant attention, and provided momentum for {{the spread of}} the Rosary. The spread of the devotion to both the Rosary and the Scapular was influenced by Marian apparitions of Our Lady of Fátima reported by three Portuguese children in 1917. The Fatima messages placed a strong emphasis on the Rosary and in them the Virgin Mary reportedly identified herself as The Lady of the Rosary. The visions and messages also encouraged the wearing of the Brown Scapular. In the final Fátima appearance on October 13, 1917 the Virgin Mary had a brown scapular <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> rosary in the other.|$|E

25|$|The rosary was {{prominently}} {{featured in}} the apparitions of Our Lady of Fátima reported by three Portuguese children in 1917. The reported Fatima messages place {{a strong emphasis on}} the Rosary and in them the Virgin Mary is identified as The Lady of the Rosary. According to Lucia Santos (one of the three children) in one of the apparitions the Virgin Mary has a rosary <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> Brown scapular in the other hand. Reports of the Fatima apparitions helped spread rosary devotions and a Fatima prayer is now often added to the end of rosary recitations. The Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary, Fatima, was built at that site in 1953 and has fifteen altars, each dedicated to a mystery of the rosary.|$|E
25|$|Rhode-Island, July 26. This Day, 26 of the Pirates {{taken by}} his Majesty Ship the Greyhound, Captain Solgard, were {{executed}} here. Some of them delivered {{what they had}} to say in writing, and most of them said something at the Place of Execution, advising all People, young ones especially, to take warning by their unhappy Fate, and to avoid the crimes that brought them to it. Their black Flag, under which they had committed abundance of Pyracies and Murders, was affix'd to one Corner of the Gallows. It had in it the Portraiture of Death, with an Hour-Glass <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>Hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> Dart in the other, striking into a Heart, and three Drops of Blood delineated as falling from it. This Flag they called Old Roger, and us'd to say, They would live and die under it.|$|E
25|$|Fafhrd is a {{very tall}} (nearly seven feet) and strong {{northern}} barbarian, skilled at both swordsmanship and singing; the Mouser is a small (not much more than five feet) mercurial thief, gifted and deadly at swordsmanship (often using a sword <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> long dagger—technically a main-gauche—in the other), and a former wizard's apprentice who retains some skill at magic. Fafhrd talks like a romantic, but his strong practicality usually wins through, while the cynical-sounding Mouser is prone to showing strains of sentiment at unexpected times. Both are rogues, living in a decadent world where to be so is a requirement of survival. They {{spend a lot of}} time drinking, feasting, wenching, brawling, stealing, and gambling, and are seldom fussy about who hires their swords. But they are humane and—most of all—relish true adventure.|$|E

25|$|Unlike sculptures done by his predecessors, these {{focus on}} {{specific}} points of narrative {{tension in the}} stories {{they are trying to}} tell: Aeneas and his family fleeing the burning Troy; the instant that Pluto finally grasps the hunted Persephone; the precise moment that Apollo sees his beloved Daphne begin her transformation into a tree. They are transitory but dramatic powerful moments in each story. Bernini's David is another stirring example of this. Michelangelo's motionless, idealized David shows the subject holding a rock <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> sling in the other, contemplating the battle; similarly immobile versions by other Renaissance artists, including Donatello's, show the subject in his triumph after the battle with Goliath. Bernini illustrates David during his active combat with the giant, as he twists his body to catapult toward Goliath. To emphasize these moments, and to ensure that they were appreciated by the viewer, Bernini designed the sculptures with a specific viewpoint in mind. Their original placements within the Villa Borghese were against walls so that the viewers' first view was the dramatic moment of the narrative.|$|E
25|$|The monument, {{carved in}} pale blue {{limestone}} by Gerard Johnson, {{is mounted on}} the north wall of the chancel. It features a demi-figure of the poet holding a quill pen <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> piece of paper resting on a cushion in the other. The style, which was popular from the late 16th to the mid-17th centuries, was most commonly used to memorialize divines, academics, and those professions with pretensions of learning. The buttoned doublet, with its ornamental slashes, was probably originally painted scarlet, the loose subfusc gown black, the eyes hazel, and the hair and beard auburn. It has been retouched many times, and was painted entirely white in 1793. This demi-figure {{is one of only}} two representations definitely accepted as accurately portraying William Shakespeare's physical appearance. The monument is topped with strapwork rising to a heraldic shield displaying Shakespeare's arms, on either side of which sits an allegorical figure: one, representing Labour, holds a spade, the other, representing Rest, holds an inverted torch and a skull.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the global}} war, the first peacetime ball at Rideau Hall was held for President of the United States Dwight D. Eisenhower, after which life within the {{household}} returned to normal. The transition from war to peace was marked by the appointment as governor general of the Viscount Alexander, whose son, Brian, reportedly used the portraits of former governors general throughout the hall as targets for his water pistol. During Alexander's tenure, Government House's first post-war Canadian royal visitors were the heiress presumptive to the throne, Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh (later Queen Elizabeth II), and her husband, Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, who came in late 1951 and, amongst other activities, took part in a square dance in the ballroom (replete with checked shirts). Churchill, once again Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, returned to Rideau Hall in January of the next year, where, sprawled on a sofa with a cigar <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> brandy in the other, he persuaded Alexander to join the British Cabinet.|$|E
