Over 10 years later, commonly available drives vary between 24× (slimline and portable units, 10× spin speed) and 52× (typically CD- and read-only units, 21× spin speed), all using CAV to achieve their claimed [...] "max" [...] speeds, with 32× through 48× most common. Even so, these speeds can cause poor reading (<b>drive</b> <b>error</b> correction having become very sophisticated in response) and even shattering of poorly made or physically damaged media, with small cracks rapidly growing into catastrophic breakages when centripetally stressed at 10,000-13,000 rpm (i.e. 40-52× CAV). High rotational speeds also produce undesirable noise from disc vibration, rushing air and the spindle motor itself. Most 21st-century drives allow forced low speed modes (by use of small utility programs) {{for the sake of}} safety, accurate reading or silence, and will automatically fall back if numerous sequential read errors and retries are encountered.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study directional stability during reversing of rear-wheel drive, electric powered wheelchairs (EPW) under different initial front caster orientations. Specifically, the weight distribution differences caused by certain initial caster orientations were examined as a possible mechanism for causing directional instability that could lead to accidents. Directional stability was quantified by measuring the <b>drive</b> direction <b>error</b> of the EPW by a motion analysis system. The ground reaction forces were collected to determine the load on the front casters, as well as back-emf data to attain the speed of the motors. The <b>drive</b> direction <b>error</b> was found to be different for various initial caster orientations. <b>Drive</b> direction <b>error</b> was greatest when both casters were oriented 90 degrees to the left or right, and least when both casters were oriented forward. The results show that <b>drive</b> direction <b>error</b> corresponds to the loading difference on the casters.

40|$|For solving Laplace’s {{equation}} in circular domains with circular holes, {{the null}} field method (NFM) {{was developed by}} Chen and his research group (see Chen and Shen (2009)). In Li et al. (2012) the explicit algebraic equations of the NFM were provided, where some stability analysis was made. For the NFM, the conservative schemes were proposed in Lee et al. (2013), and the algorithm singularity was fully investigated in Lee et al., submitted to Engineering Analysis with Boundary Elements, (2013). To target the same problems, a new interior field method (IFM) is also proposed. Besides the NFM and the IFM, the collocation Trefftz method (CTM) and the boundary integral equation method (BIE) are two effective boundary methods. This paper is devoted to a further study on NFM and IFM for three goals. The first goal is to explore their intrinsic relations. Since there exists no error analysis for the NFM, the second goal is to <b>drive</b> <b>error</b> bounds of the numerical solutions. The third goal is to apply those methods to Laplace’s equation in the domains with extremely small holes, which are called actually punctured disks.

The objective of this work was to analyze the relationship between selective attention and a predisposition to experience inattention errors while driving.

Pearson correlations were calculated between the ARDES and the CVST performance measures (errors and reaction times). A consistent relationship was observed between CVST performance and the scores reported by the ARDES.

Prior to starting PAP, OSAs appeared sleepier than controls in general and particularly at intersections, while making safety errors following nights {{with high levels of}} fragmented sleep compared to matched controls. Adverse effects of sleep fragmentation during the pre-PAP phase were reduced post-PAP. Greater hours of PAP-use were associated with lower sleepiness and errors on the road.

5000|$|Frequently, a RAID {{controller}} is configured to [...] "drop" [...] {{a component}} drive (that is, {{to assume a}} component drive has failed) if the drive has been unresponsive for eight seconds or so; this might cause the array controller to drop a good drive because that drive has not been given enough time to complete its internal error recovery procedure. Consequently, using RAID for consumer-marketed drives can be risky, and so-called [...] "enterprise class" [...] <b>drives</b> limit this <b>error</b> recovery time to reduce risk. Western Digital's desktop drives {{used to have a}} specific fix. A utility called WDTLER.exe limited a <b>drive's</b> <b>error</b> recovery time. The utility enabled TLER (time limited error recovery), which limits the error recovery time to seven seconds. Around September 2009, Western Digital disabled this feature in their desktop drives (e.g. the Caviar Black line), making such drives unsuitable for use in RAID configurations. However, Western Digital enterprise class drives are shipped from the factory with TLER enabled. Similar technologies are used by Seagate, Samsung, and Hitachi. Of course, for non-RAID usage, an enterprise class drive with a short error recovery timeout that cannot be changed is therefore less suitable than a desktop drive. In late 2010, the Smartmontools program began supporting the configuration of ATA Error Recovery Control, allowing the tool to configure many desktop class hard drives for use in RAID setups.|$|R

A total of 317 drivers completed the Chinese version of the ARDES, the Dula Dangerous Driving Index (DDDI), the Attention-Related Cognitive Errors Scale (ARCES) and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) questionnaires. Specific sociodemographic variables and traffic violations were also measured. Psychometric results confirm that the ARDES-China has adequate psychometric properties (Cronbach&# 39;s alpha = 0. 88) to be a useful tool for evaluating proneness to attentional errors in the Chinese driving population. First, ARDES-China scores were positively correlated with both DDDI scores and number of accidents in the prior year; in addition, ARDES-China scores were a significant predictor of dangerous driving behavior as measured by DDDI. Second, we found that ARDES-China scores were strongly correlated with ARCES scores and negatively correlated with MAAS scores. Finally, different demographic groups exhibited significant differences in ARDES scores; in particular, ARDES scores varied with years of driving experience. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Twenty-four drivers (16 males and 8 females; mean age = 39. 1; SD = 5. 5) participated in an on-road experiment.
