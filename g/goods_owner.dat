The absence of other means of conveyance, as well as the increased rapidity of transport, compels the owner of goods, at least for all the purposes of business, to resort to railway conveyance.

50|$|Set in {{the early}} days of the Depression in a small {{southern}} Indiana town named Zion, Buddy Layman is a mentally-challenged boy whose sweet nature touches most people he meets. One day a stranger named C.C. Showers passes through Zion looking for work and food. C.C. takes an immediate liking to Buddy and vice versa. C.C. is able to relate to Buddy in ways that most people aren't. The two become close friends and C.C. soon finds himself as Buddy's mentor and teacher. Jennie Mae is attracted to C.C., and though he likes her, Jennie Mae isn't the only single girl near Zion that finds C.C. a catch of a man. The town’s dry <b>goods</b> <b>owner</b> has her eye set on bringing old fashioned revival to the community. The local diner owner would love to see the church rebuilt - and all the Sunday customers it would bring to her establishment. CC’s relationship with the people of the town changes drastically when they learned that he was a former preacher who has given up preaching. That knowledge changes everything and leads to a horrible tragedy. The diner owner, despite C.C. trying to tell her multiple times that he's done with preaching for good, is adamant that C.C. will rebuild the town church and bring back traditions of worship service and songs on Sundays and Wednesdays, and leads the town in singing hymns when C.C. tries to help cure Buddy of his aquaphobia and the ringworm that has gotten into his feet, believing that he is actually baptizing Buddy. While C.C. is trying to explain to the still singing townspeople that he isn't doing a baptism, Buddy walks further downstream, when he is pulled under and drowns.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{potential}} problems in ports, which {{are expected to be}} compounded with the growth of the volumes of trade, is the dwelling of goods and its consequent costs. Container dwell time equals the duration containers are discharged and transported from ships to depots in order to be stored until the time the <b>goods</b> <b>owner</b> has released containers and dismissed it from terminals. The dwelling of goods results in taking up storage yards and port lots through congestion as well as decreasing Executive efficiency in loading and discharging which may cause an increase in lay time and demurrage costs. The purpose of the current study is an Application of ELECTRE III and Shannon Entropy for Strategy Selection for decreasing the Containers Dwell Time in Iranian Seaports. Firstly, factors involving in the Containers dwell time were dealt with in a review of the literature. Secondly, Executive strategies to decrease the Containers dwell time were formalized employing Delphi method. Thirdly, the strategies, formalized at the second stage, were prioritized by use of Shannon Entropy and ELECTRE III. According to The final results of the ELECTRE III method following strategies gained highest priority, using electronic systems, reducing the paperwork and parallel processes in cargo clearance, employing road and rail intermodal transport, round-the-clock customs operation, enhancing coordination and collaboration among organizations involved in the issuance of cargo clearance, respectively...|$|E

40|$|Third party {{logistics}} (TPL), {{the procurement}} {{of an integrated}} set of logistics services in a long-term relationship between a shipper (<b>goods</b> <b>owner)</b> and a service provider, is today a viable option for how companies carry out their logistics activities. Very little has been written on implementation or change issues in a TPL setting; these issues are identified as important, but not elaborated. There is however {{reason to believe that}} implementation of TPL arrangements, or rather establishment thereof, involves a complex change process involving substantial change {{for a wide range of}} actors in both the shipper’s and the provider’s organisation. When comparing literature that deals with the TPL establishment process with a stream of research that is concerned with logistics change, it comes to light that there is a discrepancy between the theoretical and methodological foundations of the former works, and what is written in these pieces regarding the process. It is concluded that recommendations for how to manage the establishment process are given without being founded in a theory of process, or research designs capable of studying process. The theoretical underpinnings of TPL literature are founded in a view of change as a matter of conducting rational analysis and conceiving the strategically wisest decisions for the logistics system as a whole. Implementation is viewed as an unproblematic exercise of issuing directives to affected actors, asserting that all actors are rational, therefore rationally conceived decisions will be accepted and implemented accordingly. Therefore the overarching purpose of this research is: To explore the change process of third party logistics establishment To fulfil this purpose the two streams of research mentioned above are combined. A meta-model of process consisting of the three interrelated dimensions content, context, and process forms the starting point for the study of process, but this is not sufficient for a study of change; a theory of change which is capable of capturing the mechanisms of the change process as it unfolds is also needed. Therefore the theory of change of the second stream of research mentioned above is adopted. The theory of change encompasses three models of change, which are archetypical representations of the mechanisms underlying change processes according to different assumptions of what change is and how change comes about. These models are denoted the linear, the processual, and the circular. One important aspect of this theory of change is that the approach to change should be aligned with the extent oflearning requirements on the actors who are affected by or involved in the change. An actors perspective is therefore called for, and adopted in this thesis. This thesis is the first step of a wider research effort concerned with studying the process of establishing TPL. Therefore, of the three dimensions of change, the contentdimension is excluded from study in this thesis. Governed by the meta-model of process, two research objectives are formulated: To explore the context within which the TPL establishment process unfolds and describe the contextual dependence of this process & To describe the change process of TPL establishment in terms of the linear, processual, and circular models of change The empirical investigation applied is a single-case retrospective study, in which the case is the establishment process between a Swedish company and an international TPL service provider. A total of fifteen actors have been interviewed; ten on the shipper side of the dyad, five on the provider side. Although the TPL establishment process is an interorganisational process, this thesis focuses on the intraorganisational process of the shipper, why the empirical material from the other side of the dyad is not used in this thesis, The interorganisational aspect, as well as the intraorganisational side within the provider’s organisation are nevertheless important, and will be included in future research. The interviews were carried out in an unstructured manner, in which the interviewees were asked to retell the story from their own perspectives. Actors from varying positions, who were involved in the process, are included in the study; in the total sample all groups who were most affected or involved are represented. The interviews rendered ten stories of the studied process. These stories were then analysed by means of a pattern-matching logic, in order to seek out the important contextual dependencies of the process, and to explore the mechanisms of the change process, as it evolved in context. After having conducted this first step of the ongoing research effort, four main conclusions can be drawn: - The TPL establishment process is context dependent. - Not only rational mechanisms are at play in the process. - It is important to acknowledge actors, not only systems. - It is important to acknowledge the process, not only the decision.

40|$|The core of {{this thesis}} is to explore how {{shopping}} malls in Norway are facilitated for handling container deliveries. The purpose of this investigation is to identify whether retail companies in Norway can benefit from a solution where imported goods are delivered directly out to the stores at shopping malls, without moving through a distribution center in Norway. In {{the first part of}} our thesis we will provide background information that explains the relevancy of the study. Based on this information we elaborate for the objective of the study which results in our research question, which is formulated as follows: “How are shopping malls in Norway facilitated in relation to handling container deliveries, and how would such an arrangement affect logistics costs and flexibility for the goods owners?” We have chosen a multiple case study as our research strategy because we are dealing with a phenomenon that is relatively new in a real life context. Two cases are applied in order to identify how shopping malls in Norway are facilitated with regard to handling container deliveries. These cases are the shopping malls AMFI Moss and Strømmen Storsenter. In addition, we have chosen to look at four retail companies in the clothing industry when identifying the interests of the <b>goods</b> <b>owners.</b> The data in this study was collected through interviews and observations as primary sources in addition to different sources of secondary data. Our findings show that both our chosen shopping malls are able to handle deliveries of containers, even though Strømmen Storsenter is better facilitated than AMFI Moss. In addition, our findings prove that there is a potential for cost savings if the <b>goods</b> <b>owners</b> utilize the possibility of container deliveries to shopping malls in Norway. In the last section of this paper we present the limitations of our study. These limitations are the basis for our suggestions for future research...|$|R
