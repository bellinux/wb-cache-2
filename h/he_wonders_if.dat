5|$|Picard confronts Q, {{who tells}} him that {{although}} the bout with the Nausicaan nearly cost him his life, it also gave him a sense of his mortality. It taught him that life was too precious to squander by playing it safe. Picard realizes that his attempts to suppress and ignore {{the consequences of his}} indiscretions have resulted in him losing a part of himself. Picard then declares that he would rather die as captain of the Enterprise than live as a nobody. Q sends him back to the bar fight and events unfold as they did originally, with Picard being stabbed through the heart and laughing as he collapses to the floor. In the present, Picard awakens in sickbay, a Captain again. As Picard recovers from his injury, <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> his journey into the past was one of Q's tricks or merely a dream. Nevertheless, he is grateful for the insight the experience gave him.|$|E
5|$|Stacey {{explains}} to Dot that Bradley {{knew he was}} not Lily's father. Dot informs Bradley's father Max (Jake Wood), who tells her he already knows. Concerned by Stacey telling people her secrets, <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> she has ceased taking medication for her bipolar disorder. He tells her {{that she needs to}} keep the truth about Lily's father {{and the fact that she}} killed Peggy's husband Archie (Larry Lamb) several months previously to herself. Phil tries to convince various people to let him out as he is suffering withdrawal symptoms, but nobody will. Janine awakens in Richard's flat and gets dressed, though they did not have sex. She returns home and tells Pat that she feels guilty, and Pat tells her not to inform Ryan. Janine fears that she is not good enough for Ryan, but he reassures her and they marry. Stacey attends their wedding reception in The Queen Victoria, leaving Lily in a bedroom upstairs. She is surprised by a photograph of Peggy and Archie, and is frightened to hear Phil making noises in the living room. Stacey tells Peggy that she thinks Archie is alive and locked upstairs. Peggy assures Stacey that Archie is dead, telling her that Bradley killed him, as he was posthumously found guilty of the murder. Stacey then confesses that she killed Archie.|$|E
25|$|As {{helicopters}} {{bring the}} three men aboard the recovery ship USS Iwo Jima for a hero's welcome, Lovell's voice-over describes the subsequent investigation into the explosion, and the careers of Haise, Swigert, Mattingly, and Kranz. <b>He</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> and when mankind {{will return to the}} Moon.|$|E

25|$|Charlie's {{research}} often {{interferes with}} his relationships: as with Amita {{on their first}} date, for all they could talk about is mathematics; Fleinhardt {{says that it is}} a common interest and they should not struggle to avoid the subject. Charlie and Amita had several false starts. Charlie has also spent some time with his ex-girlfriend, Susan Berry (Sonya Walger), an attractive neuroscientist from London. He had lived with Susan for two years, and Larry described this as his very own Berry's phase. However, she later reveals that she is currently involved with someone else and has to return to England. Charlie attempts to start a relationship with Amita once more, though her job offer at Harvard University strains this possibility and makes him distraught for some time. Eventually, she decides to take the alternative offer at CalSci with the hope to begin a romantic relationship with him, though his fear of possible failure causes him to question whether he wants this second chance; Don cautions him about such an attitude. Amita notices his ambivalence and isn't certain if she wants to back out of the relationship, but he then pushes it forward. Pressures from their colleagues over the inappropriateness of the relationship nearly cost them, but {{by the middle of the}} third season their romantic involvement stabilizes and they have grown considerably closer. He feels rejected when Amita does not want him to meet her father, due to his expectations about the men she dates. Initially, <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> it is based on him being Jewish, but the problem is that he is not Indian-born. Alan explains that Mr. Ramanujan would like him after meeting him. Charlie and Amita state that they love each other, and have even decided to move in together, though, the actual living arrangement has not been determined. When Amita's parents finally meet him, they are rude, but warm to him later. Alan says that Charlie will have to marry her.|$|E
500|$|Longstreet {{appears as}} a {{character}} in Row After Row, a full length one act play by American playwright, Jessica Dickey. The action of the play takes place one evening after a Gettysburg re-enactment. One re-enactor, Cal, plays Longstreet in the battle. In parts of the play, the action moves to the moments leading up to Pickett's Charge. The play ends with a tormented Longstreet addressing the future, as <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> we will ever form a [...] "more perfect union." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Dwight's Speech" [...] {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Michael Sciannamea of TV Squad {{wrote that}} <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> the Jim-Pam [...] "will reach {{some sort of}} resolution or become a season-ending cliffhanger". Sciannamea also noted that [...] "you know you're living in a Bizarro World when Dwight wins Dunder Mifflin's salesman of the year award." [...] M. Giant of Television Without Pity graded the episode with an [...] "A–." [...] Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk felt that Dwight's enlarged role was great, but noted that the episode was not as funny as his [...] "strange behavior" [...] in [...] "The Injury." ...|$|E

500|$|The song {{opens with}} three pick up beats as André 3000 counts [...] "one, two, three, oh" [...] and then leads {{into the first}} verse. The lyrics begin to {{describe}} the protagonist's concerns and doubts about a romantic relationship. <b>He</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> they are staying together just [...] "for tradition", as in the lines [...] "But does she really wanna [...] / But can't stand to see me / Walk out the door?" [...] André 3000 commented, [...] "I think it's more important to be happy than to meet up to...the world's expectations of what a relationship should be. So this is a celebration of how men and women {{relate to each other}} in the 2000s". The song then leads into the chorus, which consists of the line [...] "Hey ya!" [...] repeated eight times, accompanied by a synthesizer performing the bassline.|$|E
500|$|Martin Conway {{describes}} {{the portrayal of}} a dignified man marked by a grave expression and deep [...] "furrows ploughed by seventy years of labour and sorrow". Conway believed {{the strength of the}} portrait is in part achieved through Dürer's ability to convey this hardship, {{while at the same time}} presenting a man still imbued with traces of pride, and possessing [...] "a kind old face". Noting the obvious affection between the father and son as well as the half smile of the older man, <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> that grin might have been born of Albrecht the Elder's satisfaction that his toil has been rewarded by a son of such talent, who was now about to set out on the world for his wanderjahr. A contributing factor to this pride is that Albrecht the Elder trained his son in his own profession, as a jeweller, but at one point came to regret the choice of apprenticeship as the younger man was so obviously suited to drawing and painting. However, his son learned many skills during that period and it gave him a discipline with his hands that became a defining factor of his work, especially in his ability as an engraver.|$|E

2500|$|Mays was {{mentioned}} numerous times in Charles M. Schulz's comic strip Peanuts. One {{of the most}} famous of these strips was originally published on February 9, 1966. In it, Charlie Brown is competing in a class spelling bee and he is asked to spell the word, [...] "Maze". He erroneously spells it M-A-Y-S and screams out his dismay when he is eliminated. When Charlie Brown is later sent to the principal's office for raising his voice at the teacher regarding the incident, <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> one day he will meet Willie Mays and will have a good laugh together about the incident.|$|E
2500|$|Thor {{wakes up}} in the middle of the night, and a series of events occur where Thor twice {{attempts}} to kill the sleeping Skrýmir with his hammer. Skrýmir awakes after each attempt, only to say that he detected an acorn falling on his head or that <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> bits of tree from the branches above have fallen on top of him. The second attempt awakes Skrýmir. Skrýmir gives them advice; if they are going to be cocky at the keep of Útgarðr it would be better for them to turn back now, for Útgarða-Loki's men there won't put up with it. Skrýmir throws his knapsack onto his back and abruptly goes into the forest. High comments that [...] "there is no report that the Æsir expressed hope for a happy reunion".|$|E
2500|$|... "…Man has an {{unprecedented}} {{control over the}} world and everything in it. And so, whether he likes it or not, what happens next is very largely up to him." [...] He notes that when he spoke those words he could have had no idea that man might have unleashed forces that are now altering the Earth's climate. The naturalist highlights several meteorological and climatological catastrophes: Hurricane Katrina, the collapse of glaciers in Greenland, drought in the Amazon River, forest fires in Australia, and one of Europe's hottest summers (that caused 27,000 deaths). <b>He</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if,</b> somehow, there is a connection between these events. Scientists {{all over the world are}} linking the changes in the Earth's weather to a global rise in temperatures. The actual figure is just 0.6°C since 1900, but this is only an average. For example, the Arctic has warmed by up to 3°C, and this threatens its whole ecosystem. A team has been surveying polar bears in the region for the last 25 years, and over that time, the animals have declined in number by a quarter. Each year the Arctic ice is also now melting three weeks earlier. The overall rate of glacier melt is accelerating: in southern Greenland, the amount of ice flowing into the sea has doubled in a decade, resulting in a rise of sea levels. This is exacerbated by the increase in temperatures, which causes oceans to expand. When Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, the sea temperatures of the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean were the highest ever recorded. In addition, the 2005 hurricane season was the worst ever. Scientists who have studied such severe weather warn that from now on hurricanes in the area will be more intense, more destructive and possibly more frequent. Also in 2005, the Amazon region suffered its worse drought in 60 years, decimating local fish populations. Six months later, trees have still not recovered. The abnormally warm seas in the Atlantic had disrupted the rainfall in the forest and for similar reasons, coral reefs are also at risk, leading to the phenomenon of coral bleaching.|$|E

60|$|He {{is not a}} man much {{addicted}} to sentiment or speculation, but sometimes when his day's work is done, and he strays to his garden gate and looks out at the dim and peaceful English landscape beyond, and thence to the wide star-strewn heavens above, <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> the hour will ever come when once more he will see those dark and passionate eyes, and hear that sweet remembered voice.|$|E

6000|$|... "Catherine," [...] quietly remarked the old lady, [...] "there {{is nothing}} so {{discouraging}} {{to a doctor}} as to find {{a person who has}} sent for him out of bed. If the patient is up and about, she mystifies him; he is apt to make mistakes; he loses interest; <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> she couldn't come to him, instead of his having to go to her; but when he finds the ailing person in bed, the case is natural and straightforward; he feels at home, and knows how to go to work. If you believe in a doctor, you ought to make him believe in you. And if you are in bed, he will believe in you, and if you are out of it, he is apt not to. More than that, Mrs. Tolbridge, there is no greater compliment that you can pay to a physician you have sent for, than to have him find you in bed." ...|$|E
6000|$|I was {{sufficiently}} interested {{to continue to}} read such literature as came in my way. I was amazed to find what a number of great men--men whose names were to the fore in science--thoroughly believed that spirit was independent of matter and could survive it. When I regarded Spiritualism as a vulgar delusion of the uneducated, I could afford to look down upon it; {{but when it was}} endorsed by men like Crookes, whom I knew to be the most rising British chemist, by Wallace, who was the rival of Darwin, and by Flammarion, the best known of astronomers, I could not afford to dismiss it. It was all very well to throw down the books of these men which contained their mature conclusions and careful investigations, and to say [...] "Well, he has one weak spot in his brain," [...] but a man has to be very self-satisfied if the day does not come when <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> the weak spot is not in his own brain. For some time I was sustained in my scepticism by the consideration that many famous men, such as Darwin himself, Huxley, Tyndall and Herbert Spencer, derided this new branch of knowledge; but when I learned that their derision had reached such a point that they would not even examine it, and that Spencer had declared in so many words that he had decided against it on a priori grounds, while Huxley had said that it did not interest him, I was bound to admit that, however great, they were in science, their action in this respect was most unscientific and dogmatic, while the action of those who studied the phenomena and tried to find out the laws that governed them, was following the true path which has given us all human advance and knowledge. So far I had got in my reasoning, so my sceptical position was not so solid as before.|$|E
60|$|Mat, I {{am quite}} {{glad to hear}} that you are not hurried and fretted with work from New York this spring--I am sure I should think Sis and housekeeping, etc., would be enough to attend to. I was real amused with Sis's remarks, and all that was in the letter about her. You must none of you notice her smartness, nor criticisms, before her, nor {{encourage}} her to spread herself nor be critical, as it is not good to encourage a child to be too sharp--and I hope Sissy {{is going to be a}} splendid specimen of good animal health. For the few years to come I should think more of that than anything--that is the foundation of all (righteousness included); as to her mental vivacity and growth, they are plenty enough of themselves, and will get along quite fast enough of themselves, plenty fast enough--don't stimulate them at all. Dear little creature, how I should like to see her this minute. Jeff must not make his lessons to her in music anyways strong or frequent on any account--two lessons a week, of ten minutes each, is enough--but then I dare say Jeff will think of all these things, just the same as I am saying. Jeff writes <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> I am as well and hearty, and I suppose he means as much of a beauty as ever, whether I look the same. Well, not only as much but more so--I believe I weigh about 200, and as to my face, (so scarlet,) and my beard and neck, they are terrible to behold. I fancy the reason I am able to do some good in the hospitals among the poor languishing and wounded boys, is, that I am so large and well--indeed like a great wild buffalo, with much hair. Many of the soldiers are from the West, and far North, and they take to a man that has not the bleached shiny and shaved cut of the cities and the East. I spent three to four hours yesterday in Armory hospital. One of my particular boys there was dying--pneumonia--he wanted me to stop with him awhile; he could not articulate--but the look of his eyes, and the holding on of his hand was deeply affecting. His case is a relapse--eight days ago he had recovered, was up, was perhaps a little careless--at any rate took cold, was taken down again and has sank rapidly. He has no friends or relatives here. Yesterday he labored and panted so for breath, it was terrible. He is a young man from New England, from the country. I expected to see his cot vacated this afternoon or evening, as I shall go down then. Mother, if you or Mat was here a couple of days, you would cry your eyes out. I find I have to restrain myself and keep my composure--I succeed pretty well. Good-bye, dearest mother.|$|E
