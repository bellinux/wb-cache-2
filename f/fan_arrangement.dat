2500|$|To {{deal with}} {{increasing}} reliability problems, the Class 50 fleet was refurbished at Doncaster Works between 1979 and 1984. Doncaster had taken {{responsibility for the}} fleet after BR completed {{the purchase of the}} locomotives from English Electric. The work involved simplifying the complex electronics and removing redundant features such as slow speed control and rheostatic braking. In addition, the air intake <b>fan</b> <b>arrangement</b> was modified, because the original setup often prevented fresh air from entering the engine room and stale, oil mist-filled air from escaping, leading to many main generator failures. This was in part due to the moisture in the air in the UK: dust and other particles would lodge in the filter system and become 'gummed up' with moisture, preventing circulation which in turn also hampered the intended engine compartment pressure levels which then meant 'filtered' air could not be evacuated by the intended means. The filtration system was fundamentally sound and widely used in other countries; the problems arose because relative humidity had not been taken into account at the design stage. This modification eliminated the characteristic droning [...] "sucking" [...] noise which had earned the [...] "Hoover" [...] nickname.|$|E

50|$|Air {{entered the}} fan through the central eye and exited through the rim. These fans were thus all suction devices, extracting air from a mine and {{releasing}} {{it to the}} atmosphere. A typical installation comprised a pit head building, usually built of stone at this period, with a fan engine house alongside it.

40|$|The {{arrangement}} of the hangers in tied arch bridges {{is one of the}} key issues in optimizing the design of this typology of bridges. Bending moments in the arch and the tie and axial forces in the hangers are usually the parameters on which attention is focused. The hangers are particularly vulnerable to fatigue phenomena but the variation of axial forces in hangers is not deeply studied despite the fact that it is an important parameter in relation to the fatigue behaviour of the hangers. In this context, this paper mainly deals with the reduction of fatigue stressing in hangers of road arch bridges. The analysis is carried out by varying the vehicular load position along the deck; the assumed parameters are the maximum variation and the average variation of the hanger force. Various hanger arrangements are considered: vertical, <b>fan</b> and network <b>arrangement</b> with inclined hangers having multiple intersections. One of the main results is that, on the one hand, vertical and <b>fan</b> <b>arrangements</b> are better than network ones if the fatigue in the hangers is considered as the only parameter, and, on the other hand, network arrangements are globally the best if the bending moments in the arch and the tie and the absolute values of the axial forces in hangers are also considered. Therefore, the work also focuses on decreasing the fatigue stressing of vertical, <b>fan</b> and network <b>arrangements</b> without increasing the bending moments in the arch and the tie. The results suggest that a slight modification of the radial arrangement near the arch springing points, namely using steeper hangers, leads to a smaller force variation in the hangers without increasing the bending moments in the arch and the tie...|$|R
