5|$|Articulographs able {{to measure}} in three {{dimensions}} use six transmitter coils organized in a spherical configuration. The transmitters are arranged so that the axis of a sensor coil is never perpendicular to more than three transmitters. Through the transmitter configuration and ability to measure in multiple dimensions, three-dimensional articulographs {{are able to make}} measurements outside of the midsagittal plane. 2D articulographs require restrictive headmounts to ensure that the subject's head <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>move</b> off the plane of measurement. Because 3D articulographs are able to measure outside of the midsagittal plane, a less restrictive headmount is able to be used.|$|E
5|$|In the dry season, {{the gray}} mouse lemur faces the {{challenge}} of exploiting sparsely distributed feeding resources efficiently. Results of a recent study on this showed that the gray mouse lemur <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>move</b> around randomly, but rather use spatial cues to ﬁnd food resources {{in the absence of}} sensory cues, and that they seem to reuse common, highly efficient routes with regard to travel distance. It is believed that rather than using a route-based network, the gray mouse lemur has some sense of mental representation of their spatial environment, which they use to find and exploit food resources.|$|E
5|$|Pushing {{against an}} object that rests on a {{frictional}} surface {{can result in a}} situation where the object <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>move</b> because the applied force is opposed by static friction, generated between the object and the table surface. For a situation with no movement, the static friction force exactly balances the applied force resulting in no acceleration. The static friction increases or decreases in response to the applied force up to an upper limit determined by the characteristics of the contact between the surface and the object.|$|E

5|$|The use of violence, {{with scores}} dead and injured, is totally {{incompatible}} with the policies and principles of any social democratic party anywhere in the world. Consequently, we consider that a party in government that does not listen, that <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>move</b> {{and that does not}} immediately initiate a process of meaningful change in these circumstances, cannot {{be a member of the}} Socialist International. We are, as of today, ceasing the membership of the NDP, however we remain determined to cooperate with all the democrats in Egypt striving to achieve an open, democratic, inclusive and secular state.|$|E
5|$|There {{are mainly}} {{three types of}} camera systems. In fixed camera systems, the camera <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>move</b> at all and the system {{displays}} the player's character in a succession of still shots. Tracking cameras, on the other hand, follow the character's movements. Finally, interactive camera systems are partially automated and allow the player to directly change the view. To implement camera systems, video game developers use techniques such as constraint solvers, artificial intelligence scripts, or autonomous agents.|$|E
5|$|Each {{level has}} the player follow a linear path through waves of enemies and culminates with a boss. In boss stages the player's craft <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>move</b> forward, but hovers {{in front of}} the boss. Each boss has a single {{vulnerability}} which flashes when hit. These areas are often heavily shielded and must be hit repeatedly to remove armor. Other bosses' vulnerabilities are hidden and appear for only short periods. Most bosses have weapons that fire upon the player or reflect the player's shots. At the end of each level, players receive bonuses for defeated enemies, lives remaining, and the energy level of the player's craft. An extra life is granted if the score reaches certain thresholds.|$|E

5|$|Some animals {{mimic the}} optic {{flow of the}} background, so that the {{attacker}} {{does not appear to}} move when seen by the target. This is the main focus of work on motion camouflage, and is often treated as synonymous with it. An attacker can achieve this by choosing its flight path so as to remain on the line between the target and either some real landmark point, or a point at infinite distance (giving different pursuit algorithms). It therefore <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>move</b> from the landmark point as seen by the target, though it inevitably looms larger as it approaches. This {{is not the same as}} moving straight towards the target (classical pursuit): that results in visible sideways motion with a readily detectable difference in optic flow from the background. The strategy works whether the background is plain or textured.|$|E

This <b>does</b> <b>not</b> necessarily imply that pigeons <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>move</b> between treated buildings to limit their exposure to the deterrent, but merely that this study <b>did</b> <b>not</b> investigate this aspect.|$|R

25|$|It is {{best for}} a horse with bone spavin to be {{exercised}} daily. Preferably, this should be ridden or driven work, as round pen or longeing exercise places uneven stress on the joint. Pasture turnout may not be beneficial if the horse <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>move</b> much.|$|E
25|$|Calipers are of two types, {{floating}} or fixed. A {{fixed caliper}} <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>move</b> {{relative to the}} disc and is thus less tolerant of disc imperfections.

25|$|Long {{duration}} bonds {{tend to be}} mean reverting, {{meaning that}} they readily gravitate to a long-run average. The middle of the curve (5–10 years) will see the greatest percentage gain in yields if there is anticipated inflation even if interest rates have not changed. The long-end <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>move</b> quite as much percentage-wise because of the mean reverting properties.|$|E
25|$|For many fluorophores the {{absorption}} spectrum is {{a mirror image}} of the emission spectrum. This is known as the mirror image rule and is related to the Franck–Condon principle which states that electronic transitions are vertical, that is energy changes without distance changing as can be represented with a vertical line in Jablonski diagram. This means the nucleus <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>move</b> and the vibration levels of the excited state resemble the vibration levels of the ground state.|$|E
