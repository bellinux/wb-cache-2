Her fierce need for independence, on the other hand, was very unusual for {{a woman of the}} time. Her {{division}} between that and concern for her family resulted in contradictions between her beliefs and actions. Her views on affairs of the heart were strictly moral, but she did not believe in marriage as a social institution and regularly professed her hatred of it to Tchaikovsky. [...] "You may think, my dear Pyotr Ilyich, that I am a great admirer of marriage," [...] she wrote on 31 March 1878, [...] "but in order that you not be mistaken in anything referring to myself, I shall tell you that I am, on the contrary, an irreconcilable enemy of marriages, yet when <b>I</b> <b>discuss</b> another person's situation, I consider it necessary to do so from his point of view." [...] On another occasion, she stated more genially but no less forcefully, [...] "The distribution of rights and obligations as determined by social laws I find speculative and immoral." ...|$|E
