40|$|Abstract: Forensic geology, {{forensic}} geoscience and geoforensics (see {{the text}} for definitions) are largely concerned with searches for buried objects {{or the use}} of sediment and soil analysis as evi-dence. Geophysics, remote sensing, geostatistics, geochemistry and geomorphology are considered part of these disciplines. Traditional outcrop geology is not often considered, with very few pub-lications considering the role of mapped and logged geology. This work comprises a review of the few publishedworks, followed by a range of case studies that demonstrate how traditional, outcrop-scale drift and solid geology can be used in forensic geology. These include: using geology in the search for buried explosives and human remains; the logging of solid and drift geology for analysis of disputed rock quality; and modelling groundwater flow from an <b>illegal</b> <b>landfill</b> site. Geological mapping may assist in limiting a search area or in understanding what failed in a search or forensic investigation. The scale of forensic geology discussed bridges the gap between the two traditions of forensic geology outlined above: that of searching large areas of ground and trace evidence analysis.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an approach to}} detect and investigate the main characteristics of a solid waste landfill through the integration of geological, geographical and geophysical methods. In particular, a multi-temporal analysis of the landfill morphological evolution was carried out using aerial and satellite photos, since there were no geological and geophysical data referring to the study area. Subsequently, a surface geophysical prospection was performed through geoelectric and geomagnetic methods. In particular, the combination of electrical resistivity, induced polarization and magnetic measurements removed some of the uncertainties, generally associated with a separate utilization of these techniques. This approach was successfully tested to support the Prosecutor Office of Salerno (S Italy) during a specific investigation about an <b>illegal</b> <b>landfill.</b> All the collected field data supported {{the reconstruction of the}} site-specific history, while the real quarry geometry and site geology were defined.

40|$|Landfill {{management}} {{is a complex}} discipline, requiring very high levels of organisation, and considerable investment. Until the early 1990 ’s most Irish landfill sites were not managed to modern standards. <b>Illegal</b> <b>landfill</b> sites are, of course, usually not managed at all. Landfills are very active. The traditional idea of ‘put it {{in the ground and}} forget about it’ is entirely misleading. There is a lot of chemical and biological activity underground. This produces complex changes in the chemistry of the landfill, and of the emissions from the site. The main emissions of concern are landfill gases and contaminated water (which is known as leachate). Both of these emissions have complex and changing chemical compositions, and both depend critically on what has been put into the landfill. The gases spread mainly through the atmosphere, but also through the soil, while the leachate (the water) spreads through surface waters and the local groundwater. Essentially all unmanaged landfills will discharge large volumes of leachate into the local groundwater. In sites where the waste accepted has been properly regulated, and where no hazardous wastes are present, there is a lot known about the likely composition of this leachate and there is some knowledge of its likely biological and health effects. This is not the case for poorly regulated sites, where the composition of the waste accepted is unknown. It is possible to monitor the emissions from landfills, and to reduce some of the adverse health and environmental effects of these. These emissions, and hence the possible health effects, depend greatly on the content of the landfill, and on the details of the local geology and landscape. There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate a clear link between cancers and exposure to landfill, however, it is noted that there may be an association with adverse birth outcomes such as low birth weight and birth defects. It should be noted, however, that modern landfills, run in strict accordance with standard operation procedures, would have much less impact on the health of residents living in proximity to the site...|$|E

However, the current behavior of the stakeholders involved in the waste management process make this goal difficult to achieve. In order to boost changes in their strategies, we firstly describe an Environmental Management System (EMS) based on regulation measures and economic incentives which incorporate universities as a key new actor {{in order to create}} a 3 Rs model (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle) in the C&D waste management with costs savings. The target areas are focused mainly on producer responsibility, promotion of low-waste building technologies and creation of green jobs to fulfill three main objectives: valorization of inert wastes, elimination of <b>illegal</b> <b>landfills</b> and stimulation of demand for recycled C&D wastes. To achieve this latter goal, we have also designed a simulation model—using the Systems Dynamic methodology—to assess the potential impact of two policies (incentives and tax penalties) in order to evaluate how the government can influence the behavior of the firms in the recycling system of C&D waste aggregates.

Sadly its great potential are not used efficiently {{and all kinds of}} wastes end up in landfills where it greatly contributes to global warming. The decomposition of bio-waste releases methane gas into the atmosphere. Methane gas is considered a much more effective green house gas compare to carbon dioxide in the terms of its ability to trap heat. However, methane also is a major constituent of natural gas and some landfills use its emission as energy source.

40|$|Every year in Italy, {{hundreds}} of illegal dumping activities are detected {{but it is}} believed that there could be up to 10 times more, where the majority go undetected and are never penalized. New administrative measures against illegal dumping need to be developed that involve patrolling for illegal dump sites and dumping activities, and developing new databases for documenting their existence. This paper introduces an aerospace-based support system to fight illegal dumping and to help local governments to study their environmental impact, mapping the results of the investigations as well as collecting site specific information. Currently a wide variety of aerospace platforms (satellites, aircraft, helicopters, unmanned aerial systems, etc.) are available to monitor environmental problems, but their real effectiveness is often limited due to the capability of the on-board sensors. The availability of a high altitude viewing platform provides broad coverage, but often the technical limitations of the sensors require a mission profile close to the target to acquire high resolution data. Currently, the Italian Aerospace Research Center is developing a system, entitled "Aerospace Interoperability Framework", that provides a complete framework composed of flight and ground segments, communication links, acquisition sensors, mission paradigm logic and scheduling, data acquisition paradigm and logic, and data processing.

There have been vast reductions in the volume of waste being landfilledin many European countries {{and a reduction in}} the number of <b>illegal</b> <b>landfills</b> The European Parliament’s laws obliged the Member States to amend the national waste law; the main objectives of the implemented directives are to create the conditions for the prevention of excessive waste. Directive 2008 / 98 /EC establishes, as a goal for 2020, that waste reuse and recycling reach 50 % of the total waste produced. Poland, having joined the European Union, committed itself to implementing many changes related to waste management. The amendment of the law on the maintenance of cleanliness and order in the municipalities imposed new obligations regarding the waste management (WM) on the local government and residents. By adopting a municipal waste management system, the selected municipality made all its residents responsible for their waste. However, the fact of introducing changes does not solve the waste problem. The implementation of EU directives and the development of strategic documents such as the National Waste Management Plan (NWMP) have made a clear change in the WM approach.

In regard to the previously mentioned activities, our research group started the development of several scientific applied researches, discovering new methods and new technologies to perform an advanced environmental monitoring; particularly, the applied system is distinguished by joined use of aerial platforms (“manned” and “unmanned”) and advanced sensors (IR cameras HD, thick film solid state sensors, biosensors, QCM, digital HD photo/video 360 °, etc.). Our system allows a 3 D environmental monitoring according to “source – path – target” model; as matter of fact, the monitoring so improved allow us a full description of the investigated environmental scenario.

We tested the effectiveness of our expertise and our specific equipment to support Italian Coast Guard law enforcement. First positive results of this experimentation have encouraged the signature of a memorandum of understanding between University of Naples Parthenope and Italian Coast Guard and, today we have a permanent cooperation. The detection of illegal sanitary sewer and storm-drain connections, illicit discharges, <b>illegal</b> <b>landfills</b> and other “anomalies” produced by illegal actions {{is the core of}} our recent researches and, departing from this experience, we defined aerial infrared thermography as optimal tool to support this studies. Usually when the people use a thermal camera they try to reply at this question: ”how hot or cold an object is?” We decided to change the point of view when we analyze the raw thermal data answering to a new question: “how much energy objects give off?”. If we remember that the emissivity is the ability for an object to give off energy, we can try to determine object materials studying the emissivity by the radiometric matrix grabbed by our digital HD IR-camera. For example, analyzing the thermal dataset of a small area of sea surface if we find a gap of temperature of more than 5 ° C between two adjacent points/spots, according to the physic oceanography laws, the only reasonable explanation derives from the analysis of radiometric matrix. Where we find the anomalies we can introduce a different emissivity in the computation (based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law) and there we discover a variation in water chemical/biological/physical composition (e. g. a pollutant). In order to perform this advanced environmental monitoring we need specific aerial platforms (e. g. rotorcraft, UAV multi-rotors) with our sensors onboard, not only to examine a wide area, but also to obtain an effective proximal sensing: to grab the data close to the target with high resolution, but with a proper distance that allows the full overview of the surrounding area.

40|$|Poly(ethylene terephthalate), PET, {{recycling}} {{represents one}} of the most successful and widespread examples of polymer recycling. This material is fully recyclable and may be used for manufacturing new products in many industrial areas. Nevertheless, the excellent properties of PET needed for its many applications are also responsible for the difficult degradation of PET and an accumulation of polymer waste, which in turn creates serious environmental problems connected to littering and <b>illegal</b> <b>landfilling</b> or incineration. The main goal of this study was to examine the effect of alkali pretreatment on the properties of PET flakes. PET flakes were washed at twotemperatures, 70 °C and 75 °C and in various time intervals of 15, 18, 21, 25, and 30 min. All samples were characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and by contact angle measurements. The results showed that during the alkali treatment the partial depolymerization of PET was obtained, which resulted in the formation of various types of oligomers with hydroxyl and carboxyl end groups, which were the result of loss of high molecular structure. Decrease of intensity of characteristic vibrational bands (CO at 1717, COO at 1265 and CH 2 at 722 cm- 1) with extended time was observed (Figs. 1 and 2). Further on, the formation of hydroxyl groups at ṽ = 3428 cm- 1 was also observed as a result of PET depolimerization during the alkali treatment, which behaviour was better visible for samples washed at 75 °C and with extended washing time (Fig 2 b). During the DSC thermal analysis, multiple melting peaks were observed in some studied samples which could be linked to partial melting and re-crystallization of PET or to the occurrence of new polymer fractions of lower molecular mass (Figs. 3 and 4). It is evident that the contact angle of PET samples (Fig. 5) decreases in comparison to the PET 0, which points to the changes on the PET surface during the alkali treatment. Decrease in contact angle (which is measured with water) indicates an increase in surface hydrophilicity and increase in the number of present polar -OH and -COOH groups formed during the partial degradation. Also, the values of total surface energies and their polar and dispersive components indicate that during the alkali treatment the surface characteristics of PET flakes were slightly changed due to depolymerization (Table 3). Generally, it can be concluded that partial depolymerization of PET flakes occurs during the alkali treatment but the material retains its good properties and it is appropriate for the further recycling process...|$|R

In recent years, our research team has introduced an innovative use of aerial thermography to detect several illegal activities, as illicit landfills, unauthorized sewage and other “anomalies” on the surface waters, identified by their thermal infrared signatures [1]. This paper introduces first results of a Thermal approach, based on radiometric data used to identify different pollutants in soil matrix {{and its role in}} environmental surveys. The method adopted in this study has been developed for the main pollutants verified in the chemical analysis for land, reproduced according to the law and a laboratory task as well. The method has been developed to individualize the presence of pollutants in the soil. It’s well known how the landfill management is intricate, particularly after the capping stage, when it’s fundamental the detection of the pollutants diffusion in the surrounding area. Moreover, the problem of <b>illegal</b> <b>landfills</b> is nowdays topical, and there is a great exigency of identifying this critical areas. The traditional methods used for checking the soil that have been polluted consist in collecting samples of land, afterwards analyzed in chemical laboratories. This kind of analyses requires a great amount of resources such as time and money, even though in most cases is compulsery to know as soon as possible the conditions of the site. It is clear that the need of a new technology is increasingly felt. The latest advanced technology available today are remote and proximal sensing, in which the thermography plays a fundamental role. This technique is used for detecting anomalies in various sectors such as construction, renewable energy and electric systems. Previous studies demonstrate that thermography can be applied to point out pollution in rivers and sea [2]. The application of the thermography we bear in this work is the ﬁrst known for revealing contamination in lands. The indirect method here used could help in providing evidence of contamination in big areas where the state is unknown. In this case, the use of traditional laboratory techniques would be applied only when the thermographic technique reveals anomalies. The scope of this work is to: •	catalog the pollutants in liquid form, according to different emissivity value of each one considered in this study; •	appreciate the signatures of the pollutants and their aspect through radiometric data, after the scattering in soils samples. The indirect method has been used in this study for apprising the presence of pollutants, chosen as required by law, using their thermal signature detected by an IR thermal sensor. The anomalies have been identified using the thermal IR signatures of the different materials by an infrared camera which thermal sensitivity is 30 mK, and has got a 640 x 480 IR detector, that gives the temperature in every point of the acquired image (each pixel corresponds to a value of temperature or emissivity that is stored in a data matrix). The accuracy is really high (1...|$|R
