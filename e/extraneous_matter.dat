Further, cheese should be transported, stored {{and sold in}} an appropriate manner in order to avoid, among other things, the incorporation of extraneous materials (filth) of biological origin or otherwise, in contravention of the relevant food legislation. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the hygienic conditions of "prato", "mussarela", and "mineiro" cheeses sold at the street food markets in the city of S. Paulo, Brazil. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Forty-seven samples of each of the three types of cheese were collected during the period from March, 1993 to February, 1994. The Latin square was used as a statistical model for sampling and random selection of the street markets from which to collect the cheese samples. The samples were analysed for the presence of <b>extraneous</b> <b>matters</b> outside for which purpose the samples were washed and filtered and inside, for which the methodology of enzymathic digestion of the sample with pancreatine, followed by filtering,was used. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Of the 141 samples analysed, 75. 9 % exhibited at least one sort of <b>extraneous</b> <b>matters.</b> For the "prato" and "mussarela" cheeses, the high number of contaminated samples was due mainly to <b>extraneous</b> <b>matters</b> present inside the cheese, whereas in the "mineiro" cheese, besides the internal filth, 100 % of the samples had external filth...|$|R

40|$|Root biomass {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{relevant}} root parameters for studies of plant response to environmental change, soil carbon modeling or estimations of soil carbon sequestration. A major source of error in root biomass quantification of agricultural crops in the field is the presence of <b>extraneous</b> organic <b>matter</b> in soil: dead roots from previous crops, weed roots, incorporated above ground plant residues and organic soil amendments, or remnants of soil fauna. Using the isotopic difference between recent maize root biomass and predominantly C 3 -derived <b>extraneous</b> organic <b>matter,</b> we determined the proportions of maize root biomass carbon of total carbon in root samples from the Swiss long-term field trial “DOK. ” We additionally evaluated the effects of agricultural management (bio-organic and conventional), sampling depth (0 – 0. 25, 0. 25 – 0. 5, 0. 5 – 0. 75 m) and position (within and between maize rows), and root size class (coarse and fine roots) as defined by sieve mesh size (2 and 0. 5 mm) on those proportions, and quantified the success rate of manual exclusion of <b>extraneous</b> organic <b>matter</b> from root samples. Only 60 % of the root mass that we retrieved from field soil cores was actual maize root biomass from the current season. While the proportions of maize root biomass carbon were not affected by agricultural management, they increased consistently with soil depth, were higher within than between maize rows, and were higher in coarse (> 2 mm) than in fine (≤ 2 and > 0. 5) root samples. The success rate of manual exclusion of <b>extraneous</b> organic <b>matter</b> from root samples was related to agricultural management and, at best, about 60 %. We assume that the composition of <b>extraneous</b> organic <b>matter</b> is strongly influenced by agricultural management and soil depth and governs the effect size of the investigated factors. <b>Extraneous</b> organic <b>matter</b> may result in severe overestimation of recovered root biomass and has, therefore, large implications for soil carbon modeling and estimations of the climate change mitigation potential of soils...|$|R

It consists of a white, opaque, compact, calcareous stone, thickly mottled with rounded, though regular, spots of a soft, earthy, ochraceous substance. This earthy matter is of a pale yellowish- brown colour, {{and appears to be}} a mixture of carbonate of lime with iron; it effervesces with acids, is infusible, but blackens under the blowpipe, and becomes magnetic. The rounded form of the minute patches of earthy substance, and the steps in the progress of their perfect formation, which can be followed in a suit of specimens, clearly show that they are due either to some power of aggregation in the earthy particles amongst themselves, or more probably to a strong attraction between the atoms of the carbonate of line, and consequently to the segregation of the earthy <b>extraneous</b> <b>matter.</b> I was much interested by this fact, because I have often seen quartz rocks (for instance, in the Falkland Islands, and in the lower Silurian strata of the Stiper-stones in Shropshire), mottled in a precisely analogous manner, with little spots of a white, earthy substance (earthy feldspar?); and these rocks, there was good reason to suppose, had undergone the action of heat,--a view which thus receives confirmation. This spotted structure may possibly afford some indication in distinguishing those formations of quartz, which owe their present structure to igneous action, from those produced by the agency of water alone; a source of doubt, which I should think from my own experience, that most geologists, when examining arenaceo-quartzose districts must have experienced.|$|E

It was a beautiful success. I knew the substance of the sketch and the telling phrases of it; and so, the throwing of the rest of it into informal talk as I went along limbered it up and gave it the snap and go and freshness of an impromptu. I was to read several pieces, and I played the same game with all of them, and always the audience thought I was being reminded of outside things and throwing them in, and was going to hold up the book and begin on the sketch presently--and so I always got through the sketch before they were entirely sure that it had begun. I did the same thing in Budapest and had the same good time over again. It's a new dodge, and the best one that was ever invented. Try it. You'll never lose your audience--not even for a moment. Their attention is fixed, and never wavers. And {{that is not the case}} where one reads from book or MS., or where he stands up without a note and frankly exposes the fact, by his confident manner and smooth phrasing, that he is not improvising, but reciting from memory. And in the heat of telling a thing that is memorised in substance only, one flashes out the happiest suddenly-begotten phrases every now and then! Try it.

Wolter's response was to have Riesser retype the entire Chronik, leaving out any mention of the GBI's involvement in the persecution of the Jews, without telling Speer what he was doing. Wolters later wrote that he did this to correct mistakes, to leave out <b>extraneous</b> <b>matters,</b> and [...] "above all to delete certain parts on the basis of which Speer and one or another of his colleagues could still have been prosecuted. The Ludwigsburg Central office for 'war crimes' was still at work and an end of the persecution of National Socialists was not in sight." ...|$|R
40|$|Vitamin E porn palm {{fatty acid}} {{distillate}} (PFAD) was concentrated in this study by removing the <b>extraneous</b> <b>matters,</b> especiallyfree fatty acids (FFA) and acylglycerols. Original PFAD used in this study contained 85 and 13. 7 % of FFA and acylglycerols, respectively. Acylglycerols in PFAD werefirst hydrolyzed using commercially available immobilized Candida antarctica lipase at 60 C for 6 h. The fatty acids liberated, together with the existing FFA were then removed by neutralization. Hydrolysis followed by neutralization step concentrated vitamin E from an initial amount of 0. 37 to 4. 32 %. Hydrolysis was an important step as without hydrolysis, neutralization could only concentrate vitamin E to 1. 80 %. Oil extractedpom hydrolyzed and neutralized PFAD was then subjected to a normal-phase silica adsorption chromatography. The column was first eluted with hexane followed by isopropanol. A large amount of acylglycerols was removed during the first elution, while vitamin E was desorbed by isopropanol, with a recovery of> 90 %. Vitamin E concentration a f e r hydrolysis, neutralization and adsorption chromatography was 15. 2 %. The method described in this study offers an alternative fo r the existing separation methods. It could be applied as {{one of a series of}} steps in producing high-purity vitamin E concentrates...|$|R
