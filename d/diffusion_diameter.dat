40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} resistant-population cutoffs (RCOFFs) {{to allow for}} improved characterization of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in bacterial populations. RCOFFs can complement epidemiological cutoff (ECOFF) -based settings of clin-ical breakpoints (CBPs) by systematically describing the correlation between non-wild-type and wild-type populations. We illus-trate this concept by describing three paradigmatic examples of wild-type and non-wild-type Escherichia coli populations from our clinical strain database of disk <b>diffusion</b> <b>diameters.</b> The statistical determination of RCOFFs and ECOFFs and their stan-dardized applications in antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) facilitates the assignment of isolates to wild-type or non-wild-type populations.

Early readings of antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) {{results could be}} of critical importance to ensure adequate treatment. Disc diffusion is a well-standardized, established and cost-efficient AST procedure; however, its use in the clinical laboratory is hampered by the many manual steps involved, and an incubation time of 16 - 18 [*]h, which is required to achieve reliable test results. Methods We have evaluated a fully automated system for its potential for early reading of disc <b>diffusion</b> <b>diameters</b> after 6 - 12 [*]h of incubation. We assessed availability of results, methodological precision, categorical agreement and interpretation errors as compared with an 18 [*]h standard.

Disc diffusion plates were streaked, incubated and imaged using the WASPLab TM automation system. Results and conclusions Our results demonstrate that: (i) early AST reading is possible for important pathogens; (ii) methodological precision is not hampered at early timepoints; and (iii) species-specific reading times must be selected. As inhibition zone diameters change over time and are phenotype/drug combination dependent, specific cut-offs and expert rules will be essential to ensure reliable interpretation and reporting of early susceptibility testing results...|$|R

We examined {{the correlation between the}} microdilution, E-test, and disk diffusion methods for posaconazole against Candida spp. A total of 270 bloodstream isolates of Candida spp. with a broad range of posaconazole MICs were tested using the CLSI M 27 -A 2 method for microdilution, as well as the M- 44 A method and E-test methods for agar-based testing on Mueller-Hinton agar supplemented with 2 % glucose and 0. 5 μg of methylene blue. MICs and inhibitory zone diameters at the prominent growth reduction endpoint were recorded at 24 and 48 h. The Candida isolates included Candida albicans (n = 124), C. parapsilosis (n = 44), C. tropicalis (n = 41), C. glabrata (n = 36), C. krusei (n = 20), C. lusitaniae (n = 3), and C. dubliniensis (n = 2). The overall concordance (i. e., the percentage of isolates within two dilutions) between the E-test and microdilution was 64. 8 % at 24 h and 82. 6 % at 48 h. When we considered an arbitrary breakpoint of ≤ 1 μg/ml, the agreement between the E-test and microdilution methods was 87. 8 % at 24 h and 93. 0 % at 48 h.

LY 164846 was equally active against beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of Haemophilus and Staphylococcus. MBC to MIC ratios of LY 164846 versus H. influenzae were less than or equal to 2, while those with Staphylococcus aureus were more difficult to determine because of skipped tubes or paradoxic effects. There were minimal inoculum, pH, or serum effects on LY 164846 activity against H. influenzae and S. aureus. In time-kill studies, LY 164846 and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid at double MICs were 99. 9 to 100 % bactericidal to H. influenzae in 24 h; two times the MIC of LY 164846 and four times the MIC of cephalexin were 99. 9 to 100 % bactericidal to S. aureus in 24 h. Based on error-rate-bounded analysis, the following interpretative guidelines for 30 -micrograms LY 164846 disk <b>diffusion</b> test <b>diameters</b> are suggested: greater than or equal to 19 mm, susceptible (MIC, less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml); 16 to 18 mm, intermediate (MIC, greater than 4 but less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml); less than or equal to 15 mm, resistant (MIC, greater than 8 micrograms/ml) ...|$|R
40|$|Quality control (QC) ranges for {{antimicrobial}} agents against QC strains for both dilution and disk diffusion testing are currently {{set by the}} Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), using data gathered in predefined structured multilaboratory studies, so-called tier 2 studies. The ranges are finally selected by the relevant CLSI subcommittee, based largely on visual inspection and a few simple rules. We have developed statistical methods for analyzing the data from tier 2 studies and applied them to QC strain-antimicrobial agent combinations from 178 dilution testing data sets and 48 disk diffusion data sets, including a method for identifying possible outlier data from individual laboratories. The methods {{are based on the}} fact that dilution testing MIC data were log normally distributed and disk <b>diffusion</b> zone <b>diameter</b> data were normally distributed. For dilution testing, compared to QC ranges actually set by CLSI, calculated ranges were identical in 68 % of cases, narrower in 7 % of cases, and wider in 14 % of cases. For disk diffusion testing, calculated ranges were identical to CLSI ranges in 33 % of cases, narrower in 8 % of cases, and 1 to 2 mm wider in 58 % of cases. Possible outliers were detected in 8 % of diffusion test data but none of the disk diffusion data. Application of statistical techniques to the analysis of QC tier 2 data and the setting of QC ranges is relatively simple to perform on spreadsheets, and the output enhances the current CLSI methods for setting of QC ranges...|$|R
40|$|The {{diffusion}} {{mechanism of}} pure component Ar and binary mixtures of Ar/Kr and Ar/Ne confined in single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and bundles was investigated {{by a combined}} Grand Canonical Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics study. For Ar confined in SWNTs, a crossover from single-file to Fickian diffusion existed when the density of Ar was a minimum {{as a function of}} the SWNT diameter. Argon diffused by a single-file mechanism in SWNTs smaller than an accessible diameter of 1. 76 σAr, corresponding to (7, 7), (12, 0) and (8, 6) SWNTs but by a Fickian mechanism for SWNTs larger in diameter. Both components in Ar/Kr mixtures had a single-file diffusional mechanism in (6, 6) and (7, 7) SWNTs and a Fickain mechanism for SWNTs larger in diameter. Likewise, both components in a Ar/Ne mixtures had a single-file diffusional mechanism in a (6, 6) CNT, and Ar had a single-file diffusional mechanism in a (7, 7) SWCNT. However, Ne in the Ar/Ne mixture exhibited Fickian diffusion in the (7, 7) SWNT, which indicated bi-modal <b>diffusion.</b> Larger <b>diameters</b> of SWNTs provided Fickian diffusion for both components in an Ar/Ne mixture. Argon diffused in a (25, 0) SWNT bundle (with a bimodal pore size distribution) in a bimodal mechanism, with Ar diffusing in single-file in interstitial sites and in a Fickian mechanism in inner nanotube channels. In all cases of single-file diffusion the mean-squared displacement (MSD) of the fluid molecules had a square root of time dependence, while molecules diffusing by a Fickian mechanism had a MSD with a linear time dependence...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{assess the}} in vitro {{antibacterial}} activity of honey from different geographical location on Gram negative organismes. MethodsDifferent concentrations (Undiluted honey, 10 %, 30 %, 50 % and 70 % wt/vol) of honey were studied in vitro using Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes), briefly, two-fold dilutions of honey solutions were tested {{to determine the}} minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against each type of microorganism, followed by more assays within a narrower dilution range to obtain more precise MIC values. MICs were determined by both visual inspection and spectrophotometric assay at 620 nm. These honey samples were compared with standard antibiotics like ampicillin, penicillin G, amoxicillin, gentamycin, tobramycin, erythromycin and chloramphenicol {{was determined by the}} disc <b>diffusion</b> method. ResultsThe <b>diameter</b> of zone of the inhibition (ZDI) of honey has various concentrations tested for the isolates ranged 0 – 46 mm for S. aureus, 0 – 44 mm for S. pyogenes. While the MIC (%) ranged 12 %- 95 %, 25 %- 73 % respectively. ConclusionsAlgeria honey, in-vitro, possess antibacterial activity...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} spatiotemporal {{behavior}} of species concentrations in a diffusion-mediated conversion reaction which occurs at catalytic sites within linear pores of nanometer <b>diameter.</b> <b>Diffusion</b> within the pores {{is subject to}} a strict single-file (no passing) constraint. Both transient and steady-state behavior is precisely characterized by kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of a spatially discrete lattice–gas model for this reaction–diffusion process considering various distributions of catalytic sites. Exact hierarchical master equations can also be developed for this model. Their analysis, after application of mean-field type truncation approximations, produces discrete reaction–diffusion type equations (mf-RDE). For slowly varying concentrations, we further develop coarse-grained continuum hydrodynamic reaction–diffusion equations (h-RDE) incorporating a precise treatment of single-file diffusion in this multispecies system. The h-RDE successfully describe nontrivial aspects of transient behavior, {{in contrast to the}} mf-RDE, and also correctly capture unreactive steady-state behavior in the pore interior. However, steady-state reactivity, which is localized near the pore ends when those regions are catalytic, is controlled by fluctuations not incorporated into the hydrodynamic treatment. The mf-RDE partly capture these fluctuation effects, but cannot describe scaling behavior of the reactivity...|$|R
