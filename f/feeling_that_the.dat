However, Malay MPs were upset that this implied they were not electable on their own merits. <b>Feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> twinning of constituencies would lead to Malay MPs losing confidence and self-respect, the Government dropped the proposal.|$|E
5|$|In 1791, Congress {{passed a}} {{resolution}} authorizing President George Washington to establish a mint. <b>Feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> resolution was inadequate, President Washington asked legislators to pass a comprehensive law which would govern the new facility.

5|$|KRS-One {{considered}} Run-D.M.C. {{the epitome}} of rap music in 1984 and had begun to rap following their lead.

However, this gives Batman's enemies, including Penguin, Two-Face, and Harley Quinn, a chance to unite with the singular goal of killing Batman.|$|E

5|$|The poem {{contains}} Southey's {{bias against}} superstition, whether Catholic, Protestant, or pagan. He {{believed that the}} work itself was more historical than epic, and it contained many of Southey's political views. Critics gave the work mixed reviews, with many saying that there were beautiful scenes, but many <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> language fell short of being adequate for the subject matter. One review went so far to mock Southey's reliance on Welsh and Aztec names.|$|E
5|$|The {{sessions}} {{have been}} released in bootleg form as The Original Wicked Lester Sessions. Kiss officially released three tracks from these sessions on their 2001 Box Set release. Wicked Lester's music featured elements of rock and roll, folk rock and pop.

Adopting a more straightforward, harder rock sound and an emphasis on stage theatrics, they became the band Kiss in early 1973.|$|E
5|$|After Lincoln's {{assassination}} in April 1865, {{black ink}} was thrown on Fillmore's house {{as it was}} not draped in mourning like others, though he was apparently out of town {{at the time and}} put black drapes in the windows once he returned. Although he retained his position as Buffalo's leading citizen and was among those selected to escort the body when Lincoln's funeral train passed through Buffalo, there was still anger against him for his wartime positions. Fillmore supported President Andrew Johnson's Reconstruction policies, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> nation needed to be reconciled as quickly as possible. Most of his time was devoted to his civic activities. He aided Buffalo in becoming the third American city, after Boston and Philadelphia, to have a permanent art gallery with the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy.|$|E

5|$|By April 1896 the Welsh Football Union had sanctioned a {{subscription}} of 1,000 shillings to be {{contributed to the}} Gould testimonial.

The WFU stood down and withdrew their subscription. The reaction in Wales was one of anger, with the people <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> WFU had bowed to English pressure, and had been bullied into a decision against the people's wishes.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Congress {{passed the}} Line Item Veto Act, which allowed the {{president}} to cancel items from an appropriations bill (a bill authorizing spending) once passed into law. The statute was challenged the following year. The matter rapidly reached the Supreme Court, which struck down the law as violating the Presentment Clause of the Constitution, which governs {{what the president is}} permitted to do with a bill once it has passed both houses of Congress. Scalia dissented, seeing no Presentment Clause difficulties and <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> act did not violate separation of powers. Scalia indicated he felt that authorizing {{the president to}} cancel an appropriation was no different from allowing him to spend an appropriation at his discretion, which had long been accepted as constitutional.|$|E

The score of the film showed [...] "the basic power of music to terrorize and to humanize.” ...|$|R
50|$|The {{music on}} this album is the most overtly Celtic music Mike Oldfield has produced. The album had {{originally}} been recorded acoustically using only hand-played instruments. Apparently {{the daughter of an}} executive of Warner Music expressed her <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> album may have been a little boring; thus Oldfield added Synthesizers and more instruments to the album.|$|R
5|$|In Australia, however, {{public opinion}} about the matter was divided with many Australians opposed to the issue on moral grounds, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{situation}} was not desperate enough to require such a drastic measure, while others felt it {{necessary in order to}} achieve final victory. The Hughes Labor government decided to hold a plebiscite on the matter and on 28 October 1916 the matter was decided by a narrow margin of 51 per cent to 49 per cent, with the no vote prevailing. Despite the result, the issue split the Labor Party and the pro-conscription prime minister, Billy Hughes, ultimately left the party and joined with members of the opposition that supported conscription to form a new party, known as the Nationalist Party.|$|E
5|$|In {{organizing}} a 1952 exhibition of abstract art, Marcus lured local leaders {{to the show}} by two means. First, he solicited the donation of art from the collections of David Rockefeller and his brothers, along with those from other noted national business leaders.

His efforts were rewarded by a numerous and appreciative turnout for the show.|$|E
5|$|Opponents in Brooktondale to the {{construction}} felt the removal of trees would ruin the village. <b>Feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> village of Brooktondale was not likely to grow in population {{as a result of}} this project, they questioned its purpose. Ruining the scenic narrative of the area would be a waste of taxpayer dollars, since the road just ends at two dirt roads in Guideboard Corners. Despite the opposition, the state met with Caroline town officials and they noted that about 20 people were opposed to the project while a petition of 547 people supporting the job existed. In early July1962, the state gave the go-ahead for the project to begin, but that the job would begin as early as 1963.|$|E

5000|$|Murray {{encouraged}} the writer to embrace and not fear self-exposure. [...] "In effective writing and, especially in personal-essay writing, the author exposes himself or herself, revealing thoughts and <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> reader had also experienced but may have denied…and <b>that</b> is <b>the</b> strength of many essays.
