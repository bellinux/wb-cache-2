5|$|The Tasmania Coroner, Mr Sorell, {{investigated}} {{the deaths of}} the 21 people whose bodies had been recovered. He determined that the causes of their deaths were multiple fractures and injuries but he was unable to say <b>how</b> <b>or</b> in what manner they met their deaths.|$|E
5|$|Before Edward the Confessor became king of England, he was exiled to the continent. Leofric {{served as}} Edward's chaplain, {{although}} <b>how</b> <b>or</b> when exactly {{the two met}} is unknown. The historian Frank Barlow speculates {{that it may have}} been at Bruges in 1039. When Edward returned to England at the invitation of King Harthacnut, Edward's half-brother, Leofric accompanied him, witnessing charters during Harthacnut's lifetime along with Herman who later became Bishop of Sherborne. Leofric remained a close supporter and friend of Edward for the king's entire life. In 1044, Edward granted him lands at Dawlish in Devon.|$|E

5|$|Basset was {{a native}} of Montreuil-au-Houlme near Domfront in Normandy, and {{possibly}} came to the notice of King Henry while Henry was count of Domfort during the reign of Henry's older brother King William II of England (1087–1100). Either Basset himself or an earlier person with the same name held lands of Robert d'Oilly that were recorded in Domesday Book as in Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire. If the Ralph in Domesday was {{not the same as the}} judge, the Domesday Ralph may have been the judge's father. Other Bassets in the area were also recorded in Domesday, including a Wiliam and a Richard. It is not clear <b>how</b> <b>or</b> if they were related to Ralph. Ralph the judge held lands in Montreuil that in 1150 were considered to be worth two English manors. He held lands in Wallingford and Colston Basset. The lands in Wallingford were worth 16 and a third knight's fees.|$|E
5|$|Bryant became {{familiar}} with the socialist journal The Masses through Portland resident and lawyer C. E. S. Wood, who eventually married Field and who often contributed to the magazine. Enthusiastic about its contents, particularly articles by Portland native John Reed, Bryant began raising subscriptions for it. Emma Goldman, a well-known anarchist whom Wood had defended in court, gave a speech in Reed's honor at the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) hall in Portland. She and other political activists, such as Alexander Berkman, were among guests entertained by Bryant and her husband. In 1914, Reed, a Harvard graduate and established writer who by then lived in Greenwich Village, came home for a visit, during which he spoke at the University Club of Portland against the class system. Exactly <b>how</b> <b>or</b> when or how often Bryant and Reed met is uncertain, but near Christmas 1915 when Reed again came home to visit his widowed mother, the young couple announced their love at a dinner party. Reed returned to Greenwich Village on December 28, and Bryant, abandoning her marriage, followed him three days later. Trullinger filed for divorce, which was granted in July 1916, on grounds of desertion.|$|E
5|$|Newton's Second Law asserts {{the direct}} {{proportionality}} of acceleration to {{force and the}} inverse proportionality of acceleration to mass. Accelerations can be defined through kinematic measurements. However, while kinematics are well-described through reference frame analysis in advanced physics, there are still deep questions that remain {{as to what is}} the proper definition of mass. General relativity offers an equivalence between space-time and mass, but lacking a coherent theory of quantum gravity, it is unclear as to <b>how</b> <b>or</b> whether this connection is relevant on microscales. With some justification, Newton's second law can be taken as a quantitative definition of mass by writing the law as an equality; the relative units of force and mass then are fixed.|$|E

5|$|The Maharaja of Patiala again invited Kilner to {{play and}} coach in India {{in the winter of}} 1927–28. Kilner's sister Mollie later said he was very {{reluctant}} to take up the invitation and hesitated before accepting. The trip started badly when Kilner's uncle, Irving Washington, died the day after he departed, and several of Kilner's actions suggest this triggered some form of depression. Even so, Kilner recorded several large scores, including an unbeaten 283 in one (non first-class) match. Near the end of trip, he began to suffer from a fever. His Yorkshire team mates, Arthur Dolphin and Maurice Leyland, who were also in India, believed he became unwell after eating oysters, but it is not certain <b>how</b> <b>or</b> when Kilner became ill. He began to have shivering attacks and perspiration while travelling from Marseilles on the way home. It was obvious he was seriously ill when he arrived in Southampton; a cricketing engagement was cancelled and he was confined to bed. He refused treatment in Southampton, wishing to return to his family, and asking for his wife. Arriving in Wombwell on 27 March 1928, he was examined by his doctor and taken home. Subsequently, his condition deteriorated and he was taken to Kendray Fever Hospital, near Barnsley. Although it was thought he had passed the worst, his condition became critical in {{the first few days of}} April. On 5 April 1928, Kilner died from enteric fever in the presence of his wife.|$|E

"It is," [...] said Dupin; [...] "and, upon inquiring, {{of the boy}} by what {{means he}} {{effected}} the thorough identification in which his success consisted, I received answer as follows: 'When I wish to find out <b>how</b> wise, <b>or</b> <b>how</b> stupid, <b>or</b> <b>how</b> good, <b>or</b> <b>how</b> wicked is any one, or what are his thoughts at the moment, I fashion the expression of my face, as accurately as possible, {{in accordance with the}} expression of his, and then wait to see what thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart, as if to match or correspond with the expression.' This response of the schoolboy lies at the bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been attributed to Rochefoucault, to La Bougive, to Machiavelli, and to Campanella." ...|$|R

The smashing of normal society by the four decades of wars and the driving of peaceful tribes from their productive turangawaewae, such as the Moriori in the Chatham Islands by invading forces from North Taranaki, had a catastrophic effect on these conquered tribes.|$|E

25|$|The first stanza of chapter 1 {{was started}} on May 9, 1823, {{and except for}} three stanzas (XXXIII, XVIII and XIX), the chapter was {{finished}} on October 22. The remaining stanzas were completed and added to his notebook by {{the first week of}} October 1824. Chapter 1 was first published as a whole in a booklet on February 16, 1825, with a foreword which suggests that Pushkin had no clear plan on <b>how</b> (<b>or</b> even whether) he would continue the novel.|$|E
25|$|During their investigations, the FBI and the ATF {{were unable}} to find {{appropriate}} evidence, including signs of consistency between mutilations, to substantiate that the animals had been the victims of any form of ritual sacrifice or organized mutilation effort. They were also unable to determine <b>how</b> <b>or</b> why a cult would perform procedures {{that would result in}} the anomalies reported in some necropsies, or to verify that the anomalies were 1) connected to the mutilations themselves 2) the result of human intervention.|$|E
25|$|In his 1911 book Rings for the Finger, American {{mineralogist}} George Frederick Kunz {{addresses the}} importance of gold wedding rings in Ireland but does not mention the Claddagh ring. He does, however, include a photo of one, captioned with its correct name. Furthermore, it is unclear exactly <b>how</b> <b>or</b> when the ring {{was brought to the}} United States. In Rings Throughout the Ages (1945), James Remington McCarthy barely addresses the subject of Irish rings at all.|$|E

25|$|Ascents can be {{made from}} Patterdale village, either direct up the nose of the ridge, or by curving round to the west and {{following}} the Glenamara Park wall. Trough Head can also be reached from either Deepdale or Hag Beck, providing an approach from 'behind' the summit. Arnison Crag is often climbed as {{the first part of the}} ascent of St Sunday Crag. From here the walker can either circuit Deepdale via Fairfield, Hart Crag and Hartsop above <b>How</b> <b>or</b> swing north around Grisedale, taking in Dollywaggon Pike, Nethermost Pike and Helvellyn.|$|E
25|$|There is no given {{reason as}} to <b>how</b> <b>or</b> why the war broke out, though one likely theory is {{for control of}} oil reserves. In-game, the European Union and the United States fight China and the MEC. It is {{mentioned}} in-game that the US and EU are allies and the EU has negotiated a truce with Russia, but it is unknown if China and the MEC are allies. The game also takes place in different fronts, as the Middle East and China are being invaded by US and EU forces, and the United States is being invaded by Chinese and MEC forces.|$|E
