5|$|Her myths emphasise <b>her</b> <b>bad</b> {{temper and}} unhappiness, due to {{rejection}} {{by her father}} Shiva and her husband, and the hatred of her stepmother, Chandi (Shiva's wife, identified with Parvati in this context). In the Puranas, sage Kashyapa {{is considered to be}} her father, and not Shiva, although Lord Shiva is a father figure to her. Manasa is depicted as kind to her devotees, but harsh to people who refused to worship her. Denied full godhead by her mixed parentage, Manasa's aim was to fully establish her authority as a goddess and to acquire steadfast human devotees.|$|E

25|$|During King Alfonso XIII's unhappy marriage, he had {{numerous}} affairs and dalliances, {{some of which}} produced illegitimate children. He allegedly also made advances toward Princess Beatrice, which she rebuffed. The King expelled {{her and her husband}} from Spain, under the pretext of sending Infante Alfonso on a mission to Switzerland. At the same time, the King's circle of friends, who despised both Beatrice and Queen Ena, started to spread malicious rumours, saying that Beatrice had been expelled because of <b>her</b> <b>bad</b> behaviour, which was not true.|$|E

There is some evidence that Alfonso tried to seduce Beatrice, but she didn't give in. The king, in anger, expelled her and her husband from Spain. Then members of the king's circle spread rumours that Beatrice had been expelled because of <b>her</b> <b>bad</b> behaviour, which was not true. All this situation was very painful for the Queen, who could do nothing to help her cousin.|$|E

Upon being disconnected from the Aperture Science facility, GLaDOS treats Chell with more civility. The player then learns that GLaDOS' personality was inherited from that of Caroline, the personal assistant of Aperture Science CEO Cave Johnson and is much warmer to Chell when under Caroline's influence.|$|E

The issue of the magazine included the official announcement that David Tennant and Billie Piper, who previously played the Tenth Doctor and Rose Tyler in Doctor Who respectively, were lined up {{to appear in the}} special, along with actor John Hurt. Moffat did not want to bring Rose the character back because he felt her story was wrapped up and did not feel comfortable adding to Davies' arc. However, he liked the concept of bringing back <b>her</b> <b>Bad</b> Wolf persona and felt that Piper needed to be in the special as she symbolised the rebirth of Doctor Who.|$|E

She {{would be expected to}} carry things and aid Elizabeth on her daily round. Barbara Schnorrenberg suggests that Sarah Scott was in this function and says that {{there is good reason to}} suggest that she married poorly to escape that situation (Schnorrenberg 723). After Elizabeth's mother died, her father moved to London with his housekeeper, giving no money at all to his children. When Sarah was removed from <b>her</b> <b>bad</b> marriage, Elizabeth's father (whose ward she was) not only gave her no financial help but forbade either Elizabeth or Matthew, her brother, from relieving her distress.|$|E

25|$|Le Vau redid the exteriors of Saint-Fargeau {{at a cost}} of 200,000 livres. They {{were lost}} in a fire in 1752 and {{suffered}} further damage in 1850, thus all evidence of the appearance of Mademoiselle's residence was lost. Despite being an exile, she still visited her father at Blois. While at Saint-Fargeau, she dabbled in writing and wrote a small biography under the title of Madame de Fouquerolles despite <b>her</b> <b>bad</b> spelling and grammar. Mademoiselle looked to her financial affairs, which had been under her father's management. Having reached her majority in 1652 it was discovered that her father had not been entirely honest with the management of her finances and that was the reason for her 800,000 livres of debt. At the same time her grandmother, the Dowager Duchess of Guise, tricked Mademoiselle into signing away money to her under false pretences. Her father was involved with this, which caused her relationship with Gaston to deteriorate. In 1656, hearing that her father had been excused for his various scandals, Mademoiselle herself said she would forget the bad blood caused by his financial misdemeanours and resumed her close relationship with him.|$|E

[...] Abi's attempt at getting pregnant is unsuccessful so when Abi suffers a fall in The Vic, Babe persuades Abi to fake a miscarriage. This leaves Ben [...] "crushed" [...] when he learns of Abi's miscarriage.

Spitzer was unsure how to craft the scene, and eventually requested advice from the other series' writers. They decided that Jan would give a [...] "psychobabble" [...] response to Michael. Sitting on a panel of television writers at Northwestern University, Spitzer briefly described her reasoning, [...] "Jan’s nuts. She has some bad psychiatrist giving <b>her</b> <b>bad</b> advice." [...] He praised {{the benefits of a}} [...] "good writers room," [...] in which [...] "scenes go to this place you never could have gone to alone." ...|$|E
