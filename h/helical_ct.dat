40|$|PURPOSE:To {{quantify}} volumetric and positional aliasing during non-gated fast- and slow-scan acquisition CT in {{the presence}} of 3 D target motion. METHODS:Single-slice fast, single-slice slow, and multi-slice fast scan <b>helical</b> <b>CTs</b> were acquired of dynamic spherical targets (1 and 3. 15 cm in diameter), embedded in an anthropomorphic phantom. 3 D target motions typical of clinically observed tumor motion parameters were investigated. Motion excursions included +/- 5, +/- 10, and +/- 15 mm displacements in the S-I direction synchronized with constant displacements of +/- 5 and +/- 2 mm in the A-P and lateral directions, respectively. For each target, scan technique, and motion excursion, eight different initial motion-to-scan phase relationships were investigated. RESULTS:An anticipated general trend of target volume overestimation was observed. The mean percentage overestimation of the true physical target volume typically increased with target motion amplitude and decreasing target diameter. Slow-scan percentage overestimations were larger, and better approximated the time-averaged motion envelope, as opposed to fast-scans. Motion induced centroid misrepresentation was greater in the S-I direction for fast-scan techniques, and transaxial direction for the slow-scan technique. Overestimation is fairly uniform for slice widths < 5 mm, beyond which there is gross overestimation. CONCLUSION:Non-gated CT imaging of targets describing clinically relevant, 3 D motion results in aliased overestimation of the target volume and misrepresentation of centroid location, with little or no correlation between the physical target geometry and the CT-generated target geometry. Slow-scan techniques are a practical method for characterizing time-averaged target position. Fast-scan techniques provide a more reliable, albeit still distorted, target margin...|$|R

This assessment often starts by an unenhanced brain computed tomography (CT). PURPOSE: Re-evaluate the value of spontaneous hyperdensity of CVT on <b>helical</b> unenhanced brain <b>CT.</b> METHODS: Multicentric retrospective study on CVT probability based on visual assessment of spontaneous hyperdensity of cerebral venous system, performed by four blinded radiologists, individually then collectively, on a population including 14 <b>helical</b> unenhanced brain <b>CTs</b> with CVT and 102 unenhanced brain CTs without CVT (all confirmed by CT or magnetic resonance [MR] venography). Exclusion criteria: no DICOM image, symptoms > 15 days, CVT indirect signs on unenhanced CT. A fifth radiologist set 768 regions of interest to measure and to compare the density within the normal venous sinuses and the CVTs. RESULTS: After consensus reading, sensitivity of this sign for CVT diagnosis was 100 %, specificity 95. 1 %, and negative predictive value (NPV) 100 %, with high individual NPV (99 - 100 %). Area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was 0. 992 after consensus (0. 976 - 0. 986 individually). The spontaneous density was significantly different (P 70 HU reported only within the CVTs, except for the horizontal part of the superior sagittal sinus (hSSS). CONCLUSION: The dense triangle sign on <b>helical</b> unenhanced brain <b>CT</b> has an excellent NPV to exclude a sinus thrombosis during the first 2 weeks. However, we believe that visual assessment of spontaneous hyperdensity is not sufficient for the diagnosis of CVT, with possible false-positive of the hSSS on unenhanced CT...|$|R

50|$|Spinning tube, {{commonly}} called spiral CT, or <b>helical</b> <b>CT</b> is an imaging technique {{in which an}} entire X-ray tube is spun around the central axis of the area being scanned. These are the dominant type of scanners on the market {{because they have been}} manufactured longer and offer lower cost of production and purchase. The main limitation of this type is the bulk and inertia of the equipment (X-ray tube assembly and detector array {{on the opposite side of}} the circle) which limits the speed at which the equipment can spin. Some designs use two X-ray sources and detector arrays offset by an angle, as a technique to improve temporal resolution.|$|E
50|$|The {{choice of}} imaging {{depends on the}} {{clinical}} presentation (history, symptoms and examination findings). In the case of renal colic (one sided loin pain usually accompanied by a trace {{of blood in the}} urine) the initial investigation is usually a spiral or <b>helical</b> <b>CT</b> scan. This has the advantage of showing whether there is any obstruction of flow of urine causing hydronephrosis as well as demonstrating the function of the other kidney. Many stones are not visible on plain X-ray or IVU but 99% of stones are visible on CT and therefore CT is becoming a common choice of initial investigation. CT is not used however, when there is a reason to avoid radiation exposure, e.g. in pregnancy.|$|E
50|$|Otherwise a noncontrast <b>helical</b> <b>CT</b> scan with 5 mm {{sections}} is {{the diagnostic}} modality {{of choice in}} the radiographic evaluation of suspected nephrolithiasis. All stones are detectable on CT scans except very rare stones composed of certain drug residues in the urine, such as from indinavir. Calcium-containing stones are relatively radiodense, and they can often be detected by a traditional radiograph of the abdomen that includes the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB film). Some 60% of all renal stones are radiopaque. In general, calcium phosphate stones have the greatest density, followed by calcium oxalate and magnesium ammonium phosphate stones. Cystine calculi are only faintly radiodense, while uric acid stones are usually entirely radiolucent.|$|E

50|$|Coordinate descent {{algorithms}} {{are popular}} with practitioners owing to their simplicity, {{but the same}} property has led optimization researchers to largely ignore them {{in favor of more}} interesting (complicated) methods. An early application of coordinate descent optimization was in the area of computed tomography where it has been found to have rapid convergence and was subsequently used for clinical multi-slice <b>helical</b> scan <b>CT</b> reconstruction. Moreover, there has been increased interest in the use of coordinate descent with the advent of large-scale problems in machine learning, where coordinate descent has been shown competitive to other methods when applied to such problems as training linear support vector machines (see LIBLINEAR) and non-negative matrix factorization. They are attractive for problems where computing gradients is infeasible, perhaps because the data required to do so are distributed across computer networks.|$|R
50|$|Initial {{machines}} would {{rotate the}} X-ray source and detectors around a stationary object. Following a complete rotation, the object would be moved along its axis, {{and the next}} rotation started. Newer machines permitted continuous rotation with the object to be imaged slowly and smoothly slid through the X-ray ring. These are called helical or spiral CT machines. A subsequent development of <b>helical</b> <b>CT</b> was multi-slice (or multi-detector) CT; instead of a single row of detectors, multiple rows of detectors are used effectively capturing multiple cross-sections simultaneously. Systems with {{a very large number}} of detector rows, such that the z-axis coverage is comparable to the xy-axis coverage are often termed cone beam CT, due to the shape of the X-ray beam (strictly, the beam is pyramidal in shape, rather than conical).|$|E
50|$|If {{a kidney}} stone is {{suspected}} (e.g. {{on the basis}} of characteristic colicky pain or the presence of a disproportionate amount of blood in the urine), a kidneys, ureters, and bladder x-ray (KUB film) may assist in identifying radioopaque stones. Where available, a noncontrast <b>helical</b> <b>CT</b> scan with 5 millimeter sections is the diagnostic modality of choice in the radiographic evaluation of suspected nephrolithiasis. All stones are detectable on CT scans except very rare stones composed of certain drug residues in the urine. In patients with recurrent ascending urinary tract infections, {{it may be necessary to}} exclude an anatomical abnormality, such as vesicoureteral reflux or polycystic kidney disease. Investigations used in this setting include ultrasonography of the kidneys or voiding cystourethrography. CT scan or abdominal ultrasonography is useful in the diagnosis of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis; serial imaging may be useful for differentiating this condition from kidney cancer.|$|E
50|$|Ultrasound imaging of {{the kidneys}} can {{sometimes}} be useful, as it gives details {{about the presence of}} hydronephrosis, suggesting the stone is blocking the outflow of urine. Radiolucent stones, which do not appear on KUB, may show up on ultrasound imaging studies. Other advantages of renal ultrasonography include its low cost and absence of radiation exposure. Ultrasound imaging is useful for detecting stones in situations where X-rays or CT scans are discouraged, such as in children or pregnant women. Despite these advantages, renal ultrasonography in 2009 was not considered a substitute for noncontrast <b>helical</b> <b>CT</b> scan in the initial diagnostic evaluation of urolithiasis. The main {{reason for this is that}} compared with CT, renal ultrasonography more often fails to detect small stones (especially ureteral stones), as well as other serious disorders that could be causing the symptoms. A 2014 study confirmed that ultrasonography rather than CT as an initial diagnostic test results in less radiation exposure and did not find any significant complications.|$|E

A thorough understanding of the normal cross-sectional anatomy is fundamental to properly interpret pathologic processes. Pathologic processes include both solid and cystic masses.
