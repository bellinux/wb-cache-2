A {{preliminary investigation}} into the powder production of a novel hybrid titanium neural <b>electrode</b> <b>for</b> <b>EEG</b> is presented. The rheological behavior of titanium powder suspensions using sodium alginate as a dispersant are examined for optimal slip casting conditions. Electrodes were slip cast and sintered at 950 ??C for 1 hr, 1000 ??C for 1, 3, and 6 hrs, and 1050 ??C for 1 hr. Residual porosities from sintering are characterized using Archimedes' technique and image analysis. The pore network is gel impregnated by submerging the electrodes in electrically conductive gel and placing them in a chamber under vacuum. Gel evaporation of the impregnated electrodes is examined. Electrodes are characterized in the dry and gelled states using impedance spectrometry and compared to a standard silver- silver chloride electrode. Power spectral densities for the sensors in the dry and gelled state are also compared. Residual porosities for the sintered specimens were between 50. 59...|$|E

40|$|Soft and pliable {{conductive}} polymer composites hold promise for application as bioelectronic interfaces such as <b>for</b> electroencephalography (<b>EEG).</b> In clinical, laboratory, and real-world EEG {{there is a}} desire for dry, soft, and comfortable interfaces to the scalp {{that are capable of}} relaying the microvolt-level scalp potentials to signal processing electronics. A key challenge is that most material approaches are sensitive to deformation-induced shifts in electrical impedance associated with decreased signal-to-noise ratio. This is a particular concern in real-world environments where human motion is present. The entire set of brain information outside of tightly controlled laboratory or clinical settings are currently unobtainable due to this challenge. Here we explore the performance of an elastomeric material solution purposefully designed for dry, soft, comfortable scalp contact <b>electrodes</b> <b>for</b> <b>EEG</b> that is specifically targeted to have flat electrical impedance response to deformation to enable utilization in real world environments.

The specificity {{of the relationship}} between REMS and the impairment of thermoregulation was tested by eliciting the reflex release of Thyrotropin Releasing Hormone (TRH), which is integrated at hypothalamic level. By inducing the sequential secretion of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) and Thyroid Hormone, TRH intervenes in the regulation of obligatory and non-shivering thermogenesis. Experiments were performed on male albino rats implanted with epidural <b>electrodes</b> <b>for</b> <b>EEG</b> recording and 2 silver-copper wire thermodes, bilaterally placed in the preoptic-hypothalamic area (POA) and connected to small thermoelectric heat pumps driven by a low-voltage high current DC power supply.

In this study, both {{short and long-term}} homeostatic aspects of REMS regulation were analyzed during cold exposure and during subsequent recovery at Ta 24 degrees C. Design: EEG activity, hypothalamic temperature, and motor activity were studied during a 24 -h exposure to Tas ranging from 10 degrees C to - 10 degrees C and for 4 days during recovery. Setting: Laboratory of Physiological Regulation during the Wake-Sleep Cycle, Department of Human and General Physiology, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna. Subjects: 24 male albino rats. Interventions: Animals were implanted with <b>electrodes</b> <b>for</b> <b>EEG</b> recording and a thermistor to measure hypothalamic temperature. Measurements and Results: REMS occurrence decreased proportionally with cold exposure, but a fast compensatory REMS rebound occurred during {{the first day of}} recovery when the previous loss went beyond a "fast rebound" threshold corresponding to 22 % of the daily REMS need. A slow REMS rebound apparently allowed the animals to fully restore the previous REMS loss during the following 3 days of recovery. Conclusion: Comparing the present data on rats with data from earlier studies on cats and humans, it appears that small mammals have less tolerance for REMS loss than large ones. In small mammals, this low tolerance may be responsible on a short-term basis for the shorter wake-sleep cycle, and on long-term basis, for the higher percentage of REMS that is quickly recovered following REMS deprivation...|$|R

Male Wistar rats were implanted with <b>electrodes</b> <b>for</b> <b>EEG</b> and EMG recordings. Using the single platform method, the animals were submitted to 18 It of sleep restriction, beginning at 16 : 00 h (lights on at 07 : 00 h), followed by a 6 It sleep window (from 10 : 00 It to 16 : 00 h) for 21 days. Immediately after this period, rats were allowed to sleep freely for 4 days (recovery period). the sleep-wake cycle was recorded throughout the entire experiment and the results showed that during the 6 It sleep window there was an increase on the percentage of sleep time, reflected by augmented time in high amplitude slow wave sleep and in paradoxical sleep, when compared to baseline sleep, whereas bouts of awakening longer than 1. 5 min were greatly reduced, with the animals exhibiting a monophasic-type sleep pattern. During the deprivation period, paradoxical sleep was abolished. High amplitude slow wave sleep was also greatly affected by the protocol. Nonetheless, one day of recovery was sufficient to restore the normal sleep pattern. These findings indicate that this protocol was capable to induce many changes in the rat's sleep patterns, suggesting that during the 6 It sleep window there is a sleep adaptive homeostatic process.

Susceptible and non-susceptible animals were submitted to repeated sound stimulations for 14 – 16 days and hip-pocampal mitotic activity was studied through the incorpo-ration of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). Cell death and mossy fiber sprouting were assessed, respectively, by using Fluoro-Jade and Timm staining, 2 and 32 days after the last kindling stimulation. In addition, we used immunofluorescent double labeling for a glial and a mitotic marker to evaluate newly born cell identity. Some animals had hippocampus and amygdala <b>electrodes</b> <b>for</b> <b>EEG</b> recordings. Our results show that kindled animals with 6 – 11 general-ized limbic seizures (class IV–V) had increased cell prolifer-ation in the dentate gyrus when compared with animals with zero or one to three seizures.

It has become a research approach to improve the performance of human-computer interaction, because of its advantages including multiple objectives, less recording <b>electrodes</b> <b>for</b> electroencephalogram (<b>EEG)</b> signals, and strong anti-interference capacity. Traditional SSVEP using light flicker stimulation may cause visual fatigue with a consequent reduction of recognition accuracy. To avoid the negative impacts on the brain response caused by prolonged strong visual stimulation for SSVEP, steady-state motion visual {{evoked potential}} (SSMVEP) stimulation method was used in this study by an equal-luminance colored ring-shaped checkerboard paradigm. The movement patterns of the checkerboard included contraction and expansion, which produced less discomfort to subjects. Feature recognition algorithms based on power spectrum density (PSD) peak was used to identify the peak frequency on PSD in response to visual stimuli. Results demonstrated that the equal-luminance red-green stimulating paradigm within the low frequency spectrum (lower than 15 Hz) produced higher power of SSMVEP and recognition accuracy than black-white stimulating paradigm. PSD-based SSMVEP recognition accuracy was 88. 15 ± 6. 56 %. There was no statistical difference between canonical correlation analysis (CCA) (86. 57 ± 5. 37 %) and PSD on recognition accuracy. This study demonstrated that equal-luminance colored ring-shaped checkerboard visual stimulation evoked SSMVEP with better SNR on low frequency spectrum of power density and improved the interactive performance of BCI...|$|R
40|$|Electrophysiological studies {{provide useful}} {{information}} for diagnosis and classification of myoclonus, {{and for the}} investigation of its generative mechanisms, due to association of myoclonus with abnormally increased excitability of cortical structures. In this work we analyzed the polygraphic data of a 7 -year old girl affected by continuous partial epilepsy with focal myoclonus both related and not related with epileptiform discharges on EEG. We applied Sample Entropy (SampEn) and Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZ) methods to investigate the regularity and complexity content of EEG recordings and to find possible analogies in the behaviour of non-parametric complexity measures in epilepsy and in myoclonus. Our results show that these algorithms succeeded in finding {{a significant difference between}} the hypothesized focus on C 3 electrode and the contralateral <b>electrode</b> C 4, <b>for</b> <b>EEG</b> correlated myoclonus. A significant difference between the two contralateral electrodes (C 3 -C 4) was also found <b>for</b> non <b>EEG</b> correlated myoclonus, but only by means of SampEn. This preliminary study confirmed the ability of entropic methods in discriminating myoclonic events. Indeed, near the myoclonic focus location both SampEn and LZ methods showed below average values...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The aim of {{the paper}} is to assess the {{interaction}} of the neural potentials during a time discrimination psychoacous-tic task. Ten subjects participated in the experiment and were asked about the equality of two acoustic pulses: one reference of 500 ms and one trial that varied from 420 ms to 620 ms. During the experimental procedure, Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Event Related Potential (ERP) signals were recorded. The analysis combines results from Continuous Wavelet signal processing and subjects responses which were analyzed based on psychoacoustic theory. The Wavelet Coherence metric index is employed to assess the interaction of neural potentials. The results indicate the points at which the duration of the trial pulse is equal to 560 ms and 460 ms as the minimum and maximum of the Wavelet Coherence metric index, respectively. This observation is valid in most <b>electrodes,</b> <b>for</b> all basic <b>EEG</b> rhythms, revealing in parallel the differentiation of the gamma rhythm, in relation to the others. These maximum and minimum values are correlated to the Just Noticeable Difference (JND) in pulses duration, calculated by the psychoacoustic analysis. I...|$|R
40|$|Background. This study {{elucidates}} {{the impact}} of sampling site when estimating pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) parameters of drugs such as remifentanil that undergo tissue extraction in the biophase. The interrelationship between the concentrations of remifentanil predicted for the effect compartment and those measured in arterial, venous, and cerebrospinal fluid were investigated under steady-state conditions. Methods. Following induction of anaesthesia with pentobarbital, an arterial cannula (femoral) and two venous catheters (jugular and femoral) were inserted. <b>Electrodes</b> were placed <b>for</b> <b>EEG</b> recording of theta wave activity. Each dog received two consecutive 5 -min infusions for the PK-PD study and a bolus followed by a 60 -min infusion was started for the steady-state study. Cerebrospinal fluid, arterial and venous blood samples were drawn simultaneously after 30, 40, and 50 min. At {{the end of the}} infusion, arterial blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis. Results. Remifentanil PK-PD parameters based on theta wave activity were as follows: apparent volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) (231 – 37 ml kg 1), total body clearance (Cl) (63 – 16 ml min 1 kg 1), terminal elimination half-life (t 1 / 2 b) (7. 71 min), effect compartment concentration a...|$|R

3000|$|Each (real or random) PIN {{was then}} shown on a {{computer}} exactly 150 times to each user (in a random order), meaning a total of 900 events for which we recorded the EEG signal in sets of 300, together with a tag T ranging from 1 to 6 (with T= 1 the correct PIN and T= 2 to 6 the incorrect ones). We used 32 Ag–AgCl <b>electrodes</b> <b>for</b> the <b>EEG</b> signals collection. These {{were placed on the}} scalp using a WaveGuard cap from Cephalon, using the international 10 - 10 system. The stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) was set to 1.009  s (i.e., slightly more than 1  s, to reduce the environmental noise). The time each PIN was shown was set to 0.5  s. When no PIN was displayed on the screen, a + sign was maintained {{in order to keep the}} focus of the user on the center of the screen. We additionally ensured that two identical 4 -digit codes were always separated by at least two other 4 -digit codes. The split of our experiments in sub-experiments of 300 events was motivated by a maximum duration of 5  min, during which we assumed the users to remain focused on the screen. The signals were amplified and sampled at a 1000  Hz rate with a 32 -channel ASA-LAB EEG system from Advanced NeuroTechnologies. Eventually, and in order to identify eye blinks which potentially perturb the EEG signal, we added two bipolar surface electrodes on the upper left and lower right sides of the right eye and rejected the records for which such an artifact was observed. This slightly reduced the total number of events stored for each user. (Precisely, this number was reduced to 900, 818, 853, 870, 892, 887, 878, 884, for users 1 – 8.) [...]...|$|R
