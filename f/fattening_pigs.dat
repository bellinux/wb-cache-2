6000|$|Amongst {{the minor}} uses of this 'Dragon,' the sweet {{yellowish}} berries called masainhas were famous for <b>fattening</b> <b>pigs.</b> The splinters made tooth-picks which, dipped in the juice, secured health for human gums.

The same semi-mystical name is given to the sap by the Arab pharmists: in the Middle Ages this strong astringent resin was a sovereign cure for all complaints; now it is used chiefly for varnishes. The gum forms great gouts like blood where the bark is wounded or fissured: at first it is soft as that of the cherry, but it hardens by exposure to a dry red lump somewhat like 'mummy.' It has no special taste: when burnt the smell is faintly balsamic. The produce was collected in canes, and hence the commercial name 'Dragon's blood in reeds.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Again, in the {{domesticated animal}} all {{variations}} {{have an equal}} chance of continuance; and those which would decidedly render a wild animal unable to compete with its fellows and continue its existence are no disadvantage whatever {{in a state of}} domesticity. Our quickly <b>fattening</b> <b>pigs,</b> short-legged sheep pouter pigeons, and poodle dogs could never have come into existence in a state of nature, because the very first step towards such inferior forms would have led to the rapid extinction of the race; still less could they now exist in competition with their wild allies. The great speed but slight endurance of the race horse, the unwieldy strength of the ploughman's team, would both be useless in a state of nature. If turned wild on the pampas, such animals would probably soon become extinct, or under favourable circumstances might each gradually lose those extreme qualities which would never be called into action, and in a few generations revert to a common type, which must be that in which the various powers and faculties are so proportioned to each other as to be best adapted to procure food and secure safety,--that in which by the full exercise of every part of its organisation the animal can alone continue to live. Domestic varieties, when turned wild, must return to something near the type of the original wild stock, or become altogether extinct.[F] ...|$|E
6000|$|The invariable {{practice}} was, first, {{to place}} a bottle of rum and a pitcher of water before the lad, and to order him to try his hand at mixing a glass of grog. Four applicants were incontinently rejected for manifesting a natural inaptitude at hitting the juste milieu, in this {{important part of the}} duty of a cabin-boy. Most of the candidates, however, were reasonably expert in the art; and the captain soon came to the next requisite, which was, to say [...] "Sir," [...] in a tone, as Noah expressed it, somewhere between the snap of a steel-trap and the mendicant whine of a beggar. Fourteen were rejected for deficiencies on this score, the captain remarking that most of them [...] "were the sa'ciest blackguards" [...] he had ever fallen in with. When he had, at length, found one who could mix a tumbler of grog, and answer [...] "Sir," [...] to his liking, he proceeded to make experiments on their abilities in carrying a soup-tureen over a slushed plank; in wiping plates without a napkin, and without using their shirt-sleeves; in snuffing candles with their fingers; in making a soft bed with few materials besides boards; in mixing the various compounds of burgoo, lobscouse, and dough, (which he affectedly pronounced duff); in <b>fattening</b> <b>pigs</b> on beef-bones, and ducks on the sweepings of the deck; in looking at molasses without licking his lips; and in various other similar accomplishments, which he maintained were as familiar to the children of Stunin'tun, as their singing-books and the ten commandments. The nineteenth candidate, to my uninstructed eyes, seemed perfect; but Noah rejected him for the want of a quality that he declared was indispensable to the quiet of the ship. It appeared that he was too bony about an essential part of his anatomy, a peculiarity that was very dangerous to a captain, as he himself was once so unfortunate as to put his great toe out of joint, by kicking one of those ill-formed youngsters with unpremeditated violence; a thing that was very apt to happen to a man in a hurry. Luckily, No. twenty passed, and was immediately promoted to the vacant berth. The very next day the ship put to sea, in good condition, and with every prospect of a fortunate voyage.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} farm-level economic and technical factors that are associated with the use of antibiotics on pig farms. Identification of such factors, like farm size and net farm result, may help to increase epidemiological knowledge and to specify farm advice and policy making to reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics. The study used over 300 farm-year records collected during 2004 to 2007 from pig farms in the Netherlands. Data included economic and technical factors as well as antibiotic administration. Data were statistically analyzed for factors associated with antibiotic use, both for <b>fattening</b> <b>pig</b> and sow farms (piglets only), separately. The response variable was the average number of daily dosages per average pig year. Statistical analysis was performed on 16 and 19 potential explanatory factors for the <b>fattening</b> <b>pig</b> and sow farms, respectively. The results showed that, both on the <b>fattening</b> <b>pig</b> and sow farms, the average use of antibiotics increased from 2004 to 2006, but decreased during 2007, but the effect of year was not significant (P > 0. 05). Use of antibiotics varied between individual farms. Large farm repeatability for the use of antibiotics in the different years was found. Factors associated (P 0. 05) related to the on-farm use of antibiotics. Therefore, it is recommended to focus future research on the potential role of socioeconomic factors associated with antibiotic use on pig farms...|$|R

40|$|Conjoint {{analysis}} was conducted to elicit Dutch broiler and <b>fattening</b> <b>pig</b> farmers’ preferences about different characteristics of production systems, with primary interest in farmers’ intrinsic motivation towards animal welfare (AW).

The results showed that farmers preferred conventional practices and had negative preferences towards free-range systems. Two clusters of broiler farmers were distinguished. The ‘Free-range opposed’ cluster evaluated a production system by focusing on a single aspect, the provision of free-range access, while the ‘Multi-attribute focused’ cluster included multiple attributes in their evaluation. In the case of <b>fattening</b> <b>pig</b> farmers, no clusters could be identified. Results showed that farmers {{do not have a}} strong intrinsic motivation to switch to a system with higher animal welfare standards.

50|$|A. pleuropneumoniae {{was found}} to be the causative agent for up to 20% of all {{bacterial}} pneumonia cases in swine. The main disease associated with this bacterium is porcine pleuropneumonia, a highly contagious respiratory disease, affecting primarily young pigs (usually less than 6 months). All of the symptoms and signs of porcine pleuropneumonia can be attributed to its virulence factors. The symptoms include respiratory distress, bloodstained discharge (usually frothy) from the mouth, fever, anorexia, mild diarrhea, cyanosis, lethargy, and spontaneous abortion in sows. The most common sign for a pig farmer is the sudden death of several pigs over a short period of time. Peak mortality is usually reached when pigs are 10-16 weeks old. It is not uncommon for mortality rates to reach 20-80% in <b>fattening</b> <b>pigs,</b> with similarly high morbidity. Pigs that do survive the disease remain as carriers and spread the bacterium to other swine. Several bacterial combinations are seen in vivo, the most common simultaneous infection being Pasteurella multocida. Treatment must be immediate and continuous. Antibiotics used include ceftiofur, tetracycline, synthetic penicillins, tylosin, and sulfonamides.|$|E
50|$|In many European {{countries}} where certain diseases {{have not been}} detected, (PRRS, TGE, swine fever, etc.) vaccines are not usually given. In organic pig production, respiratory diseases and lameness have been cited as the most common health detriments, and depending on the location, a lesser prevalence exists conventional production. Since antibiotics {{are not allowed to}} maintain the organic integrity of an animal, some producers will forgo antibiotics altogether, even with sick animals occurring in the system. However, according to USDA-NOP Guidelines, antibiotics and other treatments that no longer make the animal organic are required to maintain overall herd health. The use of antibiotics in herds with organic <b>fattening</b> <b>pigs</b> is lower compared to herds with conventional pigs. This is probably a result of the alternative system leading to a lower infection level, since no difference in mortality pigs could be discovered. As a large percentage of organic pork production systems are pasture-based, or not living on concrete, a degree of risk is present from soil based pathogenic exposure. There are options for producers, including organically approved bio-control agents, diatomaceous earth (DE), and acidified grain rations, among others. However, many of these contain anecdotal evidence only, and the study on pasture rotation to control parasitic infections is largely unknown and research is required.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} major reasons why Ascaris {{is still so}} {{prevalent}} in current high intensity pig farms.First, {{because it has a}} direct life cycle, and is therefore not reliant on other organisms for its transmission to new hosts. Second, the female parasitic worms are highly fecund and are capable of producing hundreds of thousands of eggs per day that contaminate the surroundings instantaneously. One study showed that pigs that are naturally exposed to a paddock contaminated with A. suum have the highest egg excretion approximately 17 weeks after being introduced onto the paddock. After this point, egg counts seem to drop again. The lifespan of adult A. suum worms can be over 1 year, which is significantly longer than the average lifespan of a fattening pig these days. Therefore, once adult worms are present in <b>fattening</b> <b>pigs,</b> egg shedding increases with the age of the pigs unless the worms are cleared from the intestine by anthelmintic therapy. Third, the eggs of A. suum are generally considered to be highly resistant to external environmental factors suggesting their possible survival for up to several years in the appropriate conditions.So, even if parasitic worms are flushed from the intestine by anthelmintic drugs (which do not have a remanent effect), the pig keeps on reinfecting itself continuously since it is present in a highly contaminated environment. This ensures the establishment of fresh infections very rapidly after treatment. These factors, together with the seemingly unimportant health consequences of A. suum infections have led to a certain negligent attitude towards roundworm infections {{on the part of the}} farmer.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine how the change in agricultural policy and market conditions changes the economy of Finnish <b>fattening</b> <b>pig</b> farms. The economy of these farms is evaluated with the measures of liquidity, profitability, and solvency. Based on the data of 32 book-keeping farms in 1993, a static simulation model, i. e. the physical production processes are assumed to remain constant, is used to project the economic situation of these farms for 1995 - 2000. The same data is used in the support areas A (southern coast), B (southern Finland) and C 1 (central Finland). Projected input and output prices, and support forms relevant to the particular farms are taken into account in the model. The farms were divided into three groups with respect to their cost-efficiency in 1993. The impacts of EU membership for the farms of different cost-efficiency levels are examined. For example, the decrease of net farm income from 1993 to 1995 is considerable in every examined area. In addition, in the areas A and B, the net farm income will decline rapidly during the transitional period (1995 - 1999) as the transitional period support decreases. At the same time, the net farm income in the area C 1 will remain fairly constant because of the Nordic support. The absolute differences between the groups will decrease according to all measures used, but the differences will remain yet considerable in the most measures. While evaluating the results, one must consider the nature of the static model used, and that the farms used as data are larger and more efficiently operated than the average <b>fattening</b> <b>pig</b> farms in Finland. vokMTT Taloustutkimus (MTTL) The impact of EU membership on the economy of Finnish <b>fattening</b> <b>pig</b> farm...|$|R
