5000|$|A few {{existing}} <b>FM</b> <b>tuners</b> {{tuned to}} a channel broadcasting an HD Radio signal {{are prone to}} increased noise on the analog signal, called [...] "HD Radio self-noise" [...] (http://www.ham-radio.com/k6sti/hdrsn.htm), due to analog demodulation of the digital signal(s). In some high fidelity <b>FM</b> <b>tuners</b> in quality playback systems this noise can be audible and irritating. A few existing <b>FM</b> <b>tuners</b> might require major internal modifications to the internal filters (http://www.ham-radio.com/k6sti/iboccer.htm) or {{the addition of a}} post-detection filter (http://www.ham-radio.com/k6sti/ibocfltr.htm) may be required to prevent degradation of the analog signal quality on stations broadcasting with HD Radio.|$|R

They support Winamp playlists and allow repeat, shuffle play and programmable functions. Several preset and one user-defined EQ settings are included, plus a built-in <b>FM</b> <b>tuner.</b>|$|E
50|$|Fisher <b>FM</b> <b>tuners</b> and {{receivers}} {{often used}} similar designs and components thus allowing parts to be swapped between various models. A {{good example is}} the FM stereo multiplex decoder module.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{the tube}} was {{intended}} for operation in VHF circuits, such as TV sets and <b>FM</b> <b>tuners,</b> as an oscillator/frequency converter, but it also found wide use in audio as a driver and phase-inverter in vacuum tube push-pull amplifier circuits.|$|R
50|$|Half wave folded dipoles {{are often}} used for FM radio antennas; {{versions}} made with twin lead which can be hung on an inside wall often come with <b>FM</b> <b>tuners.</b> The T2FD antenna is a folded dipole. They are also widely used as driven elements for rooftop Yagi television antennas.|$|R
25|$|The clix {{supports}} audio formats of MP3, WMA (including protected WMA), and Ogg Vorbis; the MPEG-4 SP video format (other formats are converted with included software), the Unicode text format, and Flash Lite {{games and}} animation.

25|$|A {{last step}} taken by Revox {{produced}} even more-advanced cassette drives with electronic finetuning of bias and equalization during recording. Revox also produced amplifiers, {{a very expensive}} <b>FM</b> <b>tuner,</b> and a pickup with a special parallel-arm mechanism of their own design. After releasing that product, Studer encountered financial difficulties. It had to save itself by folding its Revox-branch and all its consumer products (except their last reel-to-reel recorder, the B77).|$|E
25|$|The NOMAD Jukebox Zen Xtra, or the Zen Xtra (renamed by Creative for {{commercial}} reasons) was released simultaneously with the Zen NX. The player was presumably named Xtra, {{thanks to the}} larger screen. The package includes the player, a leather case with belt-clip, a lithium ion battery, a USB cable, {{and a pair of}} standard earbuds. The Zen Xtra does not support the <b>FM</b> <b>tuner</b> from the original Zen and does not have recording functionality.|$|E

50|$|Following {{the mass}} {{production}} of 'stereo' vinyl records in 1958, the QC 22 control unit {{was developed and}} released in 1959. This was a stereo control unit {{that was designed to}} be used with a pair of QUAD II mono power amplifiers. To complement the QUAD II, the company also produced AM and <b>FM</b> <b>tuners</b> for use with the QC II & 22 control units.|$|R
5000|$|Only some Galaxy Note II {{variants}} have {{a built-in}} <b>FM</b> radio <b>tuner.</b> For example, some US and Canadian variants (SGH-i317, SGH-i317M) and the LTE International version (N7105) lack the <b>FM</b> radio <b>tuner</b> support. [...] SC-02E for Japan market has 1seg digital-TV tuner and antenna. Korean variants have the T-DMB tuner {{as well as}} the T-DMB antenna that can be concealed in the phone body.|$|R
25|$|The Sansa m200 {{series are}} digital audio players {{that have been}} {{released}} in four models: m230 (512MB), m240 (1GB), m250 (2GB), and m260 (4GB). The players have a built-in <b>FM</b> <b>tuner</b> and microphone, and supports MP3, WMA, WAV, and Audible (.aa) audio file formats. It comes in different colors (one for each memory size) such as blue, black, pink, and gray, and uses a single AAA battery for power. There were four different hardware revisions of this player.

25|$|The Sansa Express is a flash-based {{digital audio}} player in {{capacities}} of 1GB and 2GB. It {{has a built-in}} USB connector and a 1.1-inch, duochromatic OLED display, a microSD slot, an <b>FM</b> <b>tuner,</b> a microphone for voice recording, an internal Lithium-Ion battery, and a lanyard to wear it around the neck. It is also able to record FM radio and voice on its internal memory. This player is not considered as a descendant of the c200 series, as it only plays audio. It is more similar to the m200 series and maintains much of its design and internal software structure. It is the world's first known cable-less flash-based digital audio player, though a USB cable {{is included in the}} package if one is required to be used.|$|E
25|$|The ZEN Neeon 2, a {{successor}} to the Neeon, was announced on August 2, 2006. The player has a 1.5-inch CSTN-LCD display in a resolution of 128x128. The 1 and 2GB models are available in a black, silver, blue, pink or orange backplate, accompanied with a piano black front, while the 4GB model comes only in black and silver. The Neeon 2 supports MP3, WMA, and WAV, display JPEG images and plays AVI videos which are transcoded upon transfer. Also, the player has an <b>FM</b> <b>tuner,</b> built-in microphone, and line-in recording in WMA. The rechargeable lithium-ion battery plays up to 20 hours of continuous audio playback and up to 8 hours of video playback, the highest for any Creative digital audio player.|$|E
50|$|FM {{radio on}} the new band had to begin from the ground floor. As a {{commercial}} venture, it remained a little-used audio enthusiasts' medium until the 1960s. The more prosperous AM stations, or their owners, acquired FM licenses and often broadcast the same programming on the FM station as on the AM station ("simulcasting"). The FCC limited this practice in the 1960s. By the 1980s, since almost all new radios included both AM and <b>FM</b> <b>tuners,</b> <b>FM</b> became the dominant medium, especially in cities. Because of its greater range, AM remained more common in rural environments.|$|R

50|$|Mixed-signal ICs {{are often}} used to convert analog signals to digital signals so that digital devices can process them. For example, mixed-signal ICs are {{essential}} components for <b>FM</b> <b>tuners</b> in digital products such as media players, which have digital amplifiers. Any analog signal (such as an FM radio transmission, a light wave or a sound) can be digitized using a very basic analog-to-digital converter, and the smallest and most energy efficient of these {{would be in the}} form of mixed-signal ICs.|$|R
