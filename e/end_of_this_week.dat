40|$|Background: Idiopathic perianal {{pruritus}} is {{a poorly}} managed condition. Topical corticosteroids {{are effective in}} idiopathic perianal pruritus, but they may cause some side effects. In this study, the effectiveness of topical steroids were compared with perianal cleansers {{in the treatment of}} idiopathic perianal pruritus. Patients and methods: Seventy two patients with the complaint of perianal pruritus were evaluated; 60 of the 72 patients were found to be idiopathic. Twenty eight patients were treated with topical steroids and 32 patients were treated only with a liquid cleanser. Results: At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> two <b>week</b> period, cleansers were found to be as effective as topical corticosteroids. Conclusion: This study shows that perianal cleansers {{can be used as a}} safe first step treatment in idiopathic perianal pruritus.

40|$|A {{research}} study {{was carried out}} to determine whether native language teaching courses that utilize creative drama activities are more efficient in developing oral communication skills in primary school students than the traditionally applied native language teaching courses. In the present research, the elements of oral communication skills of primary school students were investigated in terms of pronunciation and interpretation skills. The study group consisted of two groups of fourth-year students attending an elementary school in the provincial city-center of Erzurum, Turkey, during the 2006 - 2007 educational year. A random sampling technique was used to form the experiment (n = 32) and control (n = 33) groups. An observation form was developed to assess oral communication skills and collect data. The validity <b>of</b> <b>this</b> form was verified by referring it to experts and its reliability was confirmed by seven educators. This measurement tool was applied on the experiment and control groups as both a pre-test and post-test. In concordance {{with the aim of}} the study, the traditional method, using a teacher-centered course-book, was implemented in the control group, whereas native language instruction lessons were implemented utilizing drama activities in the experiment group. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> 14 <b>week</b> period, both groups participated in the post-test.

40|$|It {{is known}} that type I {{scoliosis}} often benefits from physical therapy treatment, the patients being able to diminish the Cobb angle by use of physical exercises. It is also known {{that the most important}} part of the treatment is static and dynamic postural realignment. This is also the most difficult part for the patient as he or she has to “rewrite” their own movement and gait patterns. In this study we have compared the evolution of two female 12 years old cases of type I scoliosis. One of the patients had a 12 ˚ Cobb angle; the other had a 10 ˚ Cobb angle and they both had as a diagnosis type I idiopathic thoracic scoliosis. Both underwent a computerized postural examination and a manual muscle testing examination. For eight weeks they both completed an identical physical therapy program. The one with the 12 ˚ Cobb angle benefited from the use of personalized computerized plantar support which she used during the eight weeks of treatment. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> eight <b>weeks</b> both patients underwent the same type of examination and we noticed that the one using the personalized computerized plantar support had a much better static and dynamic postural realignment compared to the one that did not benefit from them. This led to the conclusion that use of personalized computerized plantar support can determine earlier appearance of postural realignment and improve the results of physical therapy treatment...|$|R
5000|$|... "18 Miles Out" [...] was {{directed}} by Ernest Dickerson and co-written by Scott M. Gimple and showrunner Glen Mazzara. The storyline between Rick Grimes and Shane Walsh reaches a climax in [...] "18 Miles Out", {{in which the two}} men get into a heated argument, ultimately engaging in a physical confrontation. Gimple conceived and wrote the scene into the episode's script. In the fight scene, the moves were choreographed. Dickerson collaborated with Lonnie Smith, Jr. who served as the stunt coordinator. Smith cast two stuntmen to demonstrate and act out the scene for Lincoln and Bernthal so they could duplicate the choreography. Jeremy Connors portrayed Rick, while Trent Bry played the role of Shane. In the fight sequence, Shane topples a motorcycle onto Rick's legs, temporarily immobilizing him. The motorcycle weighed an estimated 800 pounds; in order to decrease the weight of the vehicle, Dickerson and his team emptied the gas tank. This was rehearsed at the series' production studios. Scalan Backus, The Walking Deads special effects technician, rigged the vehicle's footpeg to prevent it from sliding and making contact with the actors' legs. Backus also added a rod with a secure stable so it would give further clearance to the actors and increase the motorcycle's height from the ground. The cameramen filmed the shots at an angle, creating the illusion that the vehicle did hit the actors' legs. Writer Robert Kirkman summated on the aftermath of the confrontation:At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>week's</b> episode, Rick is of the mind that they're square; they've got everything out in the open, they've each said their piece and they both know where each other stands, they've had their big blowout and they're riding back in that car and Rick thinks he's handled it. He doesn't necessarily think he's got his friend back, but he thinks the matters are settled. From the look of Shane in that car, I don't know that he's necessarily thinking that. For the most part, this conflict may be put on the back burner for the time being. It definitely seems like Shane still has a bone to pick.While returning to Hershel's farm, Shane stares at a walker in an abandoned field. Kirkman stated the walker symbolizes the growing scope of the zombie virus. [...] "We're really just trying to show that that kind of thing is inescapable," [...] he said. [...] "You're just driving down the street, you look over and, 'Oh, there you go, there’s a zombie.' We're trying to show that this world {{is becoming more and more}} populated by zombies. Our thinking is that large population centers like Atlanta are really where the heart <b>of</b> <b>this</b> began and as and crew moved out to Hershel’s farm they didn’t really encounter very many walkers because they are moving out of the city center at a faster rate than the zombie population.

I send there by a friend every day; I send things and aid to some cases I know, and hear from there also, but I do not go myself at present. It is probable that the hospital poison has affected my system, and I find it worse than I calculated. I have spells of faintness and very bad feeling in my head, fullness and pain--and besides sore throat. My boarding place, 502 Pennsylvania av., is a miserable place, very bad air. But I shall feel better soon, I know--the doctors say it will pass over--they have long told me I was going in too strong. Some days I think it has all gone and I feel well again, but in a few hours I have a spell again. Mother, I have not heard anything of the 51st. I sent George's letter to Han. I have written to George since. I shall write again to him in a day or two. If Mary comes home, tell her I sent her my love.

40|$|Neuropeptide Y {{appears to}} {{modulate}} epileptic seizures differentially {{according to the}} receptor subtypes involved. In the hippocampus, neuropeptide Y expression and release are enhanced in different models of epileptogenesis. On the contrary, the expression of Y 1 receptors is decreased {{and it has been}} shown that activation of these receptors has pro-convulsant effects. The aim of our study was to investigate the role of Y 1 receptors during hippocampal kindling epileptogenesis using (i) knock-out mice lacking Y 1 receptors and (ii) intrahippocampal infusion of Y 1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide in rats. Y 1 knock-out mice showed similar susceptibility to seizure induction and presented no difference in kindling development as compared with their control littermates. Conversely, local hippocampal down-regulation of Y 1 receptors during the first week of hippocampal kindling, induced by a local infusion of a Y 1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide, significantly increased seizure threshold intensity and decreased afterdischarge duration. A reverse effect was observed during the week following the infusion period, which was confirmed by a significant decrease in the number of hippocampal stimulations necessary to evoke generalized seizures. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> second <b>week,</b> an up-regulation of Y 1 receptors was observed in kindled rats infused with the antisense as compared with the mismatch-treated controls. Our results in the rat suggest that the down-regulation of Y 1 receptors in the hippocampus participates in the control of the initiation of epileptogenesis. The lack of an effect of the deficiency of Y 1 receptors in the control of kindling development in Y 1 knock-out mice could be due to compensatory mechanisms...|$|R

60|$|At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> first {{vigorous}} <b>week</b> <b>of</b> hostilities it {{is interesting}} to sum up the net result. The strategical advantage had lain with the Boers. They had made our position at Dundee untenable and had driven us back to Ladysmith. They had the country and the railway for the northern quarter of the colony in their possession. They had killed and wounded between six and seven hundred of our men, and they had captured some two hundred of our cavalry, while we had been compelled at Dundee to leave considerable stores and our wounded, including General Penn Symons, who actually died while a prisoner in their hands. On the other hand, the tactical advantages lay with us. We had twice driven them from their positions, and captured two of their guns. We had taken two hundred prisoners, and had probably killed and wounded as many as we had lost. On the whole, the honours of that week's fighting in Natal may be said to have been fairly equal--which is more than we could claim for many a weary week to come.|$|R
