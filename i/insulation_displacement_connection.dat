50|$|When a {{cable is}} {{terminated}} by a connector, the various wires {{in the cable}} are connected to contacts (pins) in the connector. The most common methods of connecting pins to individual wires are soldering, <b>insulation</b> <b>displacement,</b> <b>insulation</b> piercing, screw clamping, axial screw termination, cage clamping, crimping, press-in termination, and wire wrapping. Some of these wiring methods can be accomplished without specialized tools. Other methods, while requiring a special tool, can assemble connectors to a cable much faster and more reliably, and make repairs easier.|$|R

The contacts are not pins, but small flat bands of metal, called ribbon contacts. The connectors are manufactured in many capacities, including 14-, 24-, 36-, 50-, 64-, and 100- pin varieties. They may be mounted on boards, panels, or may terminate cables. Wires are attached by means of solder, crimping or <b>insulation</b> <b>displacement.</b> Female connectors have bail locks for a sturdy connection to the male connector. Screws may also be employed to secure connections.|$|R
50|$|The early ribbon cables {{were used}} in the {{mainframe}} computer industry, on card readers, card punching machines, and tape machines. Subsequently ribbon cables were manufactured by a number of different companies, including 3M. Methods and materials were developed to simplify and reduce the cost of ribbon cables, by standardizing the design and spacing of the wires, and the thickness of the insulation, so that they could be easily terminated through the use of <b>insulation</b> <b>displacement</b> connectors (IDC). The simplicity of the cables, their low profile (compared to contemporary alternatives), and low cost due to standardization, meant ribbon cables were long used in computers, printers, and many electronic devices.|$|R

50|$|Internally, the {{contacts}} have sharp prongs that when crimped, pierce the insulation and {{connect with the}} wire conductor, a mechanism known as <b>insulation</b> <b>displacement.</b> Ethernet cables, in particular, may have solid or stranded wire conductors and the sharp prongs are different in the 8P8C connectors made {{for each type of}} wire. A modular plug for solid (single strand) wire often has three slightly splayed prongs on each contact to securely surround and grip the conductor. Modular plugs for stranded or tinsel wire have prongs that are designed to connect to multiple wire strands. Connector plugs are designed for either solid or stranded wire; a plug for one wire type might not make reliable contact when crimped to a cable with wires of the other type.|$|R

50|$|A 66 {{block is}} a type of punchdown block used to connect sets of wires in a {{telephone}} system. They have been manufactured in three sizes, A, B, and M. A and B have six clips in each row while M has only 4. The A blocks spaced the rows farther apart, and has been obsolete for many years. The B style is used mainly in distribution panels where several destinations (often 1A2 key telephones) need to connect to the same source. The M blocks are often used to connect a single instrument to such a distribution block. 66 blocks are designed to terminate 22 through 26 AWG solid copper wire. The 66 series connecting block, introduced in the Bell System in 1962, was the first terminating device with <b>insulation</b> <b>displacement</b> connector technology. The term 66 block reflects its Western Electric model number.|$|R
50|$|Since {{stripping}} the insulation from wires is time-consuming, many connectors intended for rapid assembly use insulation-displacement connectors so that insulation {{need not be}} removed from the wire. These generally {{take the form of a}} fork-shaped opening in the terminal, into which the insulated wire is pressed and which cut through the insulation to contact the conductor within. To make these connections reliably on a production line, special tools are used which accurately control the forces applied during assembly. If properly assembled, the resulting terminations are gas-tight and will last the life of the product. A common example is the multi-conductor flat ribbon cable used in computer disk drives; to terminate each of the many (approximately 40) wires individually would be slow and error-prone, but an <b>insulation</b> <b>displacement</b> connector can terminate all the wires in (literally) one stroke. Another very common use is so-called punch-down blocks used for terminating telephone wiring.|$|R

The studies were performed for the I-st temperature zone of Ukraine. Heat insulation was located on the external side of enclosure. Thermal protection problems of the angle are consideration {{of the impact of}} heat-conductive inclusion on adjusted heat transfer resistance of enclosure. Conductive inclusion on the external angle area is its configuration. An additional layer of insulation in the angle area is necessary to use for bringing the level of thermal protection of angle area to the standards.

A nonlinear, finite element computational analysis of a steel-frame composite structure incorporating a long span cellular beam with a composite deck was examined to investigate local buckling behavior, midspan <b>displacements,</b> and <b>connection</b> forces of the long span cellular beam, and to compare the results with a similar I-shaped member with no web openings.

The system makes a prediction step ahead of time, compares it with the online measured value, and makes a logical judgment based on the residual error to achieve the purpose of real-time diagnosis of the automatic monitoring system. We developed a novel combined algorithm for dam deformation prediction using two traditional models and one optimization model. The developed algorithm combines two sub-algorithms: the gray model (GM) (1, 1) and the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) model. The GM (1, 1) addresses the effects of the automated monitoring of data from unstable situations; the BPNN model addresses the internal non-linear regularity of the dam <b>displacement.</b> The <b>connection</b> weights and thresholds of the BPNN model can be optimized and determined via the genetic algorithm (GA), which can decrease the uncertainties within the model predictions and improve the prediction accuracy.

The paper presents the technological choices of materials and shapes that ensure a stable hysteretic behaviour of dissipative devices based on friction and/or plasticity and shows the results of monotonic and cyclic experimental tests performed on both single connectors and structural sub-assemblies consisting of two full scale panels.

Due to the very advanced stage of the deformation phenomena, a coupled morphodynamic style has established between shallow landslides and DGSD phenomena, affecting the exhumed ductile substratum and the overlaying rigid dismantled slab, respectively. A GPS network was realized for monitoring the Scopello landslide, consisting of 27 vertexes, which were directly cemented either onto rock or debris blocks or concrete structures rooted on the marly–clayey substratum.
