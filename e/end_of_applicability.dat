40|$|The {{progress}} {{of modern technology}} is dominated by shrinking component size (with a goal of reaching angstrom scale resolution), {{particularly with respect to}} electronics and optimization of common industrial processes such as heterogeneous catalysis. Understanding of such systems lies at the upper <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>applicability</b> for first-principles calculations and existing theoretical models, and a scientific framework is needed to understand, predict, and control these systems at the molecular level. My research has focused on organic molecules adsorbed on a Cu(111) surface as model systems, studied experimentally by means of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) as well as theoretically by density functional theory (DFT) and development of simplified explanatory models. Results of this investigation show that: 1) on Cu (111) full mono-layer coverages of acetylene undergo long-range ordering which at short-range is driven by a need to minimize localized stress induced in the upper substrate layers by adsorption while at longer ranges DFT finds an oscillatory interaction that correlates well with the surface state, 2) long-range ordered networks of anthraquinone (AQ) are found to mold the surface state into optimized quantum dots - this need for optimization under the constraint that neighbors must form H-bonds drives formation of the network at the precise size and shape observed in STM, 3) CO molecules co-adsorbed into the AQ network's pores titrate the surface state quantum dots and experience increased mobility, 4) the adsorption of anthracene modified with chalcogen linkers onto Cu (111) when viewed within a molecular orbital theory framework yields a chemical explanation for the diffusion behavior observed in STM. In combination, these observations and derived explanatory models help to characterize and quantify the fundamental physics underlying the interactions of adsorbates with one another and with the Cu (111) substrate, in a broader context acting as a model for other confined surface systems where the same kinds of interactions play a dominant role...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of internal stresses in planar random Saffil fibre reinforced aluminium {{with a range}} of fibre volume fractions has been studied theoretically and in monotonic and cyclic deformation (Bauschinger) experiments at room temperature and 77 K. The conventional method of analysing Bauschinger experiments is extended to allow for a separation of the mean and thermal stresses. This analysis is applied to experimental results enabling the mean stress hardening rate and the magnitude of the thermal stress to be measured. The experimental results are compared with predictions of the mean field model, which is based on the Eshelby method of determining internal stresses. For that purpose the Eshelby S tensor for a planar random array of fibres is calculated. Because the aluminium/Saffil composites are not isotropic in the transverse directions, the plastic strain used in the calculations has to be determined experimentally. A method for quantifying the anisotropic plastic flow of the aluminium/Saffil composites is proposed and the results are used in calculations of the mean stress hardening rate. A comparison of predictions for the mean stress hardening rate with results of the experimental analysis proposed here shows that good agreement is obtained for low fibre volume fractions at 77 K. The results also show that relaxation of the mean stress increases with fibre volume fraction and that at 77 K the mean stress hardening rate is about a factor of two larger than at room temperature. The measurements of the thermal stresses obtained in the Bauschinger experiments are in quantitative agreement with results obtained in monotonic tests. The magnitude of the thermal stress at room temperature or 77 K is independent of fibre volume fraction and a comparison with predictions shows that relaxation of the thermal stress increases with fibre volume fraction. Cycling in the Bauschinger experiments reduces the thermal stress and hence the separation of the mean and thermal stresses is essential for a reliable measurement of the mean stress hardening rate. Matrix hardening contributes considerably to the overall hardening of the composite, both at room temperature and 77 K. The modified Orowan-Wilson model, which enables the plastic friction coefficient to be measured in copper-tungsten composites, has been applied to the aluminium composites. The model requires both the mean stress and the peak stress curves obtained in Bauschinger experiments to be linear in plastic strain. Most of the peak stress curves for the aluminium/Saffil composites are non-linear but for the curves which are linear the predictions of the model are not in quantitative accord with experimental results. This may be because relaxation reduces the mean stress and the source shortening stress in different proportions. The diameter of the Saffil fibres is also close to the lower <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>applicability</b> of the model. The temperature dependence of the mean stress hardening rate suggests that relaxation is thermally activated. A model for relaxation of the mean stress is proposed. An equation is derived for the number of Orowan loops per fibre and it is assumed that the rate controlling mechanism of relaxation is cross slip of screw dislocations. The estimated activation energy is independent of fibre volume fraction but the activation volume decreases with increasing fibre volume fraction. The magnitudes of activation energy and activation volume support the assumptions of the model. A preliminary study on the early stages of fatigue shows that persistent slip bands form in the matrix of the aluminium/Saffil composites...|$|E

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{mathematical}} modeling of structures of deposited fibers that arise from the industrial production of nonwovens. The models are based on dynamical systems of stochastic differential equations describing the resulting positions of the fibers on a conveyor belt. Starting from the analysis of existing models, new concepts of modeling are developed and investigated. In this context, the main interest lies in the extensions of the models to three dimensions which enable a realistic description of the fiber orientation in space. Therefore, the containing Brownian motion or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, respectively, are enhanced to the unit sphere. More general, the fiber lay-down models are formulated for arbitrary dimensions. In addition to several asymptotic considerations, the convergence to equilibrium is investigated using entropy methods.

PELLIONISZ and LLINÁS (1982) proposed a functional geometry {{to understand the}} internal representation of the events associated to the space-timing of moving objects in the external world. The joint representation {{of space and time}} associated to an event as understood by the brain is shown to be different from that understood in modern physics. This indicates that the four-dimensional geometry i. e. Minkowski geometry is not an appropriate description for the internal world. If it is to be the case, the <b>applicability</b> <b>of</b> any kind of quantum field theory in modeling brain function has to be analyzed with great care. Here, the issue <b>of</b> <b>applicability</b> <b>of</b> quantum mechanics to brain function has been discussed in general, from an anatomical perspective and then particular emphasis has been given to the <b>applicability</b> <b>of</b> quantum field theory. 1...|$|R
