5|$|In writing these {{desultory}} letters, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>I</b> {{could not}} avoid being continually {{the first person}} – 'the little hero of each tale.' I tried to correct this fault, if it be one, for they were designed for publication; but in proportion as I arranged my thoughts, my letter, I found, became stiff and affected: I, therefore, determined to let my remarks and reflections flow unrestrained, as I perceived that I could not give a just description of what I saw, but by relating the effect different objects had produced on my mind and feelings, whilst the impression was still fresh.|$|E
500|$|The memoirs were controversial, and sparked {{complaints}} from many quarters. [...] Grant (serving as President when Sherman's memoirs first appeared) later remarked that others {{had told him}} that Sherman treated Grant unfairly but [...] "when I finished the book, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>I</b> approved every word; that ... it was a true book, an honorable book, creditable to Sherman, just to his companions—to myself particularly so—just such a book as I expected Sherman would write." ...|$|E
500|$|Of Episode 6, The Mirrors Charlie Catchpole wrote [...] "Although I wouldn't want to {{bump into}} {{any of these people}} in a wine bar, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>I</b> really cared about their {{unravelling}} relationships, their sad sexual misadventures, their petty jealousies" [...] and concluded by calling the series [...] "Exquisitely written, stylishly produced, superbly performed." [...] In The Times, Paul Hoggart summarised all six episodes as [...] " [...] a tightrope between satire and sentimentality, frequently falling off on the sugary side", but wrote positively of the writing, directing, acting, and editing. He approved of the deliberately unhappy ending, looking forward to seeing how Rachel's departure would be resolved in the second series. Andy Harries attributed the mixed critical reaction to the unusual timeslot the series was given.|$|E

500|$|The film also {{garnered}} criticism. Writing for Variety, Peter Debruge found major flaws {{with the}} film, writing, [...] "Though undeniably gorgeous, it is punishingly long, frequently boring, and woefully unengaging {{at some of}} its most critical moments. It is too subdued for Scorsese-philes, too violent for the most devout, and too abstruse for the great many moviegoers who such an expensive undertaking hopes to attract." [...] John Patterson of The Guardian stated in his review, [...] "I fear that Silence expired in the womb during that long gestation period. It is beautiful to look at, but feels inert, humourless and overly devout (to say nothing of over-long; Masahiro Shinoda's 1971 adaptation got Shūsako Endō's 1966 novel on to film using 30 fewer minutes than Scorsese). Perhaps that leap toward the devout is needed to savour it fully–and <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>I</b> couldn't make it." ...|$|E
500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a largely {{positive}} review, awarding it four stars out of four. Vitaris was complimentary towards the episode's exposition, and wrote, [...] "above all, 'The Unnatural' {{is about the}} power of storytelling. We don't really know if Dales' story is true or if it's the liquor-fueled ramblings of a broken-down man, but in the end, this is irrelevant." [...] Melissa Runstrom from Michigan Daily called it a [...] "charming independent story," [...] but that it [...] "seems to say more about the human condition than about any extraterrestrial plot". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files wrote, [...] "In his entertaining debut as an X-Files writer/director, Duchovny took us down a very familiar path this season: [...] But unlike some previous navigators, Duchovny stayed on course, made sure we saw all of the spectacular landmarks along the way and, when we reached our final destination, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>I</b> thoroughly enjoyed the ride." ...|$|E
500|$|After the loss, {{there were}} calls for Playford {{to be offered}} the post of Governor of South Australia or Governor-General of Australia, but nothing came of that. Playford {{continued}} to lead the LCL opposition for a further {{one and a half}} years until he relinquished the leadership. In the subsequent ballot, Steele Hall, a small farmer like Playford, won and led the LCL to victory at the following election with the Playmander still in place. Contrary to perceptions, Playford was loath to favour or groom a successor, and he did not publicly hint at whom he voted for in the leadership ballot; there was speculation that the former premier may have been one of those who abstained from the vote. Playford retired from politics at the same time, presumably for reasons of age, but stated that [...] "I couldn't cope with the change in the attitudes of some MPs, even some in the highest places... <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>I</b> could no longer cope with the change... I can't handle a liar who doesn't turn a hair while he's lying... I decided I couldn't take it any longer".|$|E

500|$|Several {{established}} {{actors were}} {{considered for the}} leading role of Rusty Sabich. Kevin Costner turned down the role, and Robert Redford was vetoed by Pollack due to his age. When he was hired to direct the film, Pakula only offered the role to Harrison Ford, believing that the actor possessed an [...] "Everyman quality" [...] that best suited the character. [...] Ford's casting was confirmed in March 1989. He received a $7 million salary for the role. Turow was initially uncertain of Ford portraying Rusty but relented after seeing {{a few of the}} actor's films. Ford said, [...] "Friends warned me this was a tough role because Rusty is such a passive, interior character. Though Rusty's in every scene, all the action takes place around him. Things happen to him." [...] Upon being cast, Ford read the novel to avoid arguments over events and details that were left out in the book. Ford also suggested to Pakula that Rusty have a buzz cut. He explained, [...] "There are many things <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>I</b> could express with that short haircut. Simplest of all, I wanted to tell the audience to leave their baggage at home — not to expect the Harrison Ford they've seen before." ...|$|E
500|$|On August 8 or 9 (sources {{disagree}} on the exact date), Captain Linzee spotted two American schooners making sail for Salem around 8 in the morning. [...] Quickly capturing one of the schooners without incident, he put a crew aboard the prize before giving chase to the other. [...] The captain of the second schooner, apparently familiar with the area, brought his ship deep into Gloucester Harbor and grounded it near Five Pound Island shortly after noon. [...] Linzee forced a local fisherman to pilot the Falcon and the prize schooner to an anchorage in the harbor. [...] He then sent 36 men on three small boats {{under the command of}} his lieutenant to take the ship. [...] Among the crews sent were 10 impressed Americans, including four from Gloucester. The arrival of the British ship had caused the townspeople to raise the alarm, and militia companies began to muster, led by their captains, Joseph Foster and Bradbury Sanders. [...] Armed with muskets and two aging swivel guns, they opened fire from the shore at the small boats as they neared the schooner. [...] The British rowed faster, and boarded the grounded schooner, where they were effectively trapped by constant fire from the shore. [...] Linzee, attempting to distract the townspeople, fired the Falcon guns on the town, and eventually sent a landing party to try to burn the town. [...] However, this attempt was unsuccessful, and the party on the grounded schooner continued to be harassed from the shore. [...] The lieutenant was wounded in the action, and he and a few men managed to escape the action in a skiff around 4 pm, leaving the Falcon master in charge. The remaining men on the grounded ship were eventually taken prisoner, including the impressed Americans. By 7 pm, the small boats had all been taken. Linzee then decided to send the prize schooner in to recover his men. [...] Linzee reported his suspicion that the crew of the captured ship took the opportunity to overpower the prize crew, and recovered the vessel. [...] According to Linzee, [...] "After the master was landed <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>I</b> could not do him any good, or distress the rebels by firing, therefore I left off." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{leaving the}} club Bellamy {{was quoted as}} saying [...] "I never once enjoyed it at Coventry. [...] I felt quite demoralised. I had enjoyed myself so much at Norwich– but <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>I</b> had taken a {{backward}} step." ...|$|E

I felt like a child who had marched off from home, fancying it can find its way, and is lost at once. I {{did not know that}} I had a Father in heaven who had been looking after me, when I fancied I was looking after myself. I don't half believe it now." [...] . And so the old heart passed away from Thomas Thurnall, and instead of it grew up the heart of a little child.|$|R

2500|$|The {{beautiful}} grisette looked {{sometimes at}} the gloves, then sideways to the window, {{then at the}} gloves, and then at me. [...] I was not disposed to break silence. I followed her example: [...] so, I looked at the gloves, then to the window, then at the gloves, and then at her, and so on alternately. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>I</b> lost considerably in every attack: she had a quick black eye, and shot through two such long and silken eyelashes with such penetration, that she look'd into my very heart and reins. It may seem strange, but I could actually feel she did." ...|$|E
2500|$|I think I {{agree with}} your [...] order for reading the books more than with your mother's. The series was not planned {{beforehand}} as she thinks. When I wrote The Lion I did not know I was going to write any more. Then I wrote P. Caspian as a sequel and still didn't {{think there would be}} any more, and when I had done The Voyage I felt quite sure it would be the last, but <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>I</b> was wrong. So perhaps it does not matter very much in which order anyone read them. I’m not even sure that all the others were written in the same order in which they were published.|$|E

2500|$|The band went by {{the name}} [...] "Feedback" [...] for a few months, before {{changing}} to [...] "The Hype" [...] later on. After Dik Evans left the group to join another local band, the Virgin Prunes, the remaining four officially changed the name from [...] "The Hype" [...] to [...] "U2". Initially Bono sang, played guitar and wrote the band's songs. He said of his early guitar playing in a 1982 interview, [...] "When we started out I was the guitar player, along with the Edge—except I couldn't play guitar. I still can't. I was such a lousy guitar player that one day they broke it to me that maybe I should sing instead. I had tried before, but I had no voice at all. I remember the day <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>I</b> could sing. I said, 'Oh, that's how you do it.'" [...] When The Edge's guitar playing improved, Bono was relegated mostly to the microphone, although he occasionally still plays rhythm guitar and harmonica. As of 2006, Bono has taken piano lessons from his children's piano teacher {{as a means to}} improve his songwriting.|$|E

60|$|There was {{something}} in this remark that roused again the turmoil which had begun to subside within me. There was so much that was unjust and tyrannical, and--what perhaps touched me still deeper--there was such a want of consideration and respect in this behavior of Mr. Enderton's, that it brought to the front some very incongruous emotions.
