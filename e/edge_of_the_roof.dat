5|$|After {{four weeks}} of filming in Philadelphia, {{the cast and crew}} moved to Wildwood, New Jersey, which doubled for scenes set at the Atlantic City boardwalk. Filming then moved to San Francisco, California. The scene where Birdy and Al climb atop a {{refinery}} building was filmed on the rooftop of an abandoned gasworks in Hercules, California. The scene required Modine and Cage to hang off the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> secured by safety wires, while the sequence in which Birdy falls off the roof was performed by a stunt double.|$|E
5|$|The {{station has}} two {{platforms}} positioned {{in a cutting}} partially covered with a glazed roof and partially exposed to the atmosphere. It was designed by John Fowler the MR's chief engineer. The brick-built street-level entrance building featured a balustrade along the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> decoratively topped with urns. Fowler's building was demolished and reconstructed to a design by the MR's architect Charles W Clark in 1914 with a cladding of white faïence blocks. The building is listed Grade II by Historic England. The brickwork of the platform retaining walls was restored in 1986 during a renovation of the station.|$|E
5|$|The {{script is}} {{characterized}} by numerous inexplicable mood and personality shifts in characters. In analyzing the film's abrupt tone shifts, Greg Sestero highlighted two scenes in particular. In the first scene, Johnny enters the rooftop {{in the middle of}} a tirade about being accused of domestic abuse, only to become abruptly cheerful upon seeing Mark; a few moments later, he laughs inappropriately upon learning that a friend of Mark's had been severely beaten. On set, Sestero and first assistant director Sandy Schklair repeatedly tried to convince Wiseau that the line should not be delivered as comical, but Wiseau refused to refrain from laughing. In the second instance, occurring a few scenes later, Mark attempts to kill Peter by throwing him off a roof after Peter expresses his belief that Mark is having an affair with Lisa; just as Peter is about to fall to his death, Mark pulls Peter back over the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof,</b> apologizes, and the two continue their previous conversation with no acknowledgement of what just occurred.|$|E

25|$|The {{flat roof}} and the roughly hewn {{stone of the}} outside walls give the church an aspect of {{simplicity}} and austerity. The bell tower situated at the northern <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> slightly {{to the left of}} the main entrance is the example of this minimalistic style as it is formed by a simple stone arch housing a medium size cast iron bell.|$|E
25|$|The {{tradition}} Tongan fale {{consisted of}} a curved roof (branches lashed with sennit rope, or kafa, thatched with woven palm leaves) resting on pillars made of tree trunks. Woven screens filled in the area between {{the ground and the}} <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof.</b> The traditional design was extremely well adapted to surviving hurricanes. If the winds threatened to shred the walls and overturn the roof, the inhabitants could chop down the pillars, so that the roof fell directly onto the ground. Because the roof was curved, like a limpet shell, the wind tended to flow over it smoothly. The inhabitants could ride out the storm in relative safety.|$|E

Battlements run along <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> and give <b>the</b> building a Norman character.|$|R
50|$|The eaves are <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> which {{overhang}} <b>the</b> face <b>of</b> a wall and, normally, project beyond <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> a building. <b>The</b> eaves form an overhang {{to throw}} water clear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> walls {{and may be}} highly decorated {{as part of an}} architectural style; such as the Chinese dougong bracket systems.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> {{traditional}} Malay {{houses are}} designed to provide shade and protection from heat and rain, {{as well as to}} provide ventilation. <b>The</b> basic design <b>of</b> a roof on a Malay house is gabled roof, an extended frame with ornaments on <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof.</b> <b>The</b> vernacular Malay <b>roof</b> is best suited for hot and humid tropical climates. An example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gabled <b>roof</b> can be found in <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> Rumah Lipat Kajang. However a pyramidal styled pitched roof can also be found on houses such as the Palembang Rumah Limas.|$|R
500|$|The {{height of}} {{buildings}} in Washington {{is limited by}} the Height of Buildings Act. The original Act was passed by Congress in 1899 in response to the 1894 construction of the Cairo Hotel, which is much taller than the majority of buildings in the city. The original act restricted the heights of any type of building in the United States capital city of Washington, D.C., to be no higher than , [...] for residential buildings. In 1910, the 61st United States Congress enacted a new law which raised the overall building height limit to , but restricted building heights to the width of the adjacent street or avenue plus thus, a building facing a -wide street could be only [...] tall. However, building heights are measured from the sidewalk or curb to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof.</b> Architectural embellishments, mechanical rooms, and common rooftop structures may be exempted from the overall height limit, provided they are set back from the roof line. The heights of buildings listed here may therefore exceed the general height limit as measured for the purpose of the city's zoning laws.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{buildings}} {{also featured}} antefixes, vertical ornaments of triangular or rounded shape that were placed along the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof.</b> They, too, were often made of terracotta, {{and could be}} decorated with pictorial motifs intended to avert ill-luck, or with inscriptions: those made in military tileries attached to legionary forts bore the number and symbol of the relevant legion.|$|E

2500|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{properties of}} light bars can {{be important for}} police applications, as fuel efficiency and drag are concerns in patrol and pursuit. [...] Because of this, some police cars do not have roof mounted lightbars. These ‘slick-top’ cars mount their emergency lights within the cruiser, generally around {{the periphery of the}} windshield or into the leading or trailing <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof.</b> [...] Slick-top police cars also lack the silhouette of a lightbar or beacon, making the car harder to identify as a police vehicle from a distance, especially fore and aft. [...] Because of these visual advantages, these vehicles are sometimes referred to as ‘stealth’ vehicles.|$|E
2500|$|The Ole Carlson House {{was both}} {{designed}} and built by Ole Anderson Aasved for his neighbor Ole Carlson, a fellow Norwegian immigrant farmer. [...] Its location on a slight elevation makes the structure very visible. [...] The house is a large, two-story, almost square brick structure, symmetrical in arrangement with a hip roof and roof deck, with a projecting central gabled pavilion. [...] At the time the home was completed, it had a balustrade along the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> deck, however {{it is no longer}} present. [...] In addition to the main house, a small one-story brick addition on the eastern side (rear) houses a summer kitchen. The south foundation includes a datestone with the name [...] "O. A.

5000|$|Traditional {{built up}} roofing (informally called [...] "tar-and-gravel" [...] roofing) {{consists}} of {{multiple layers of}} roofing felt mopped with layers of hot liquid bitumen, and surfaced with gravel. At <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof,</b> some means is required <b>of</b> terminating <b>the</b> <b>roofing,</b> preventing water from running underneath <b>the</b> <b>roofing,</b> and preventing <b>the</b> gravel surfacing from washing off in heavy rains. The traditional method is a sheet metal fabrication called a gravel stop.|$|R

5000|$|The rink employs an {{innovative}} structural system employing a 90-meter reinforced concrete arch, a catenary arch form for which Saarinen's projects became known. From the arch a cable net is strung, supporting a timber roof. This causes a stable, [...] form. Exterior cables linking the arch directly to <b>the</b> outer <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> were added during structural design development. These cables address forces caused by asymmetrical wind loads. Fred N. Severud was the structural engineer for the project.|$|R
