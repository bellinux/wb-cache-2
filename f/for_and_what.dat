25|$|Aggression {{can involve}} {{violence}} {{that may be}} adaptive under certain circumstances in terms of natural selection. This is most obviously the case in terms of attacking prey to obtain food, or in anti-predatory defense. It {{may also be the}} case in competition between members of the same species or subgroup, if the average reward (e.g. status, access to resources, protection of self or kin) outweighs average costs (e.g. injury, exclusion from the group, death). There are some hypotheses of specific adaptions for violence in humans under certain circumstances, including for homicide, but it is often unclear what behaviors may have been selected <b>for</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> may have been a byproduct, {{as in the case of}} collective violence.|$|E
25|$|If the ASP {{includes}} {{the provision of}} police services, then a Police Services Agreement (PSA) is also made. A PSA {{includes the}} level of policing that will be provided, {{how it will be}} paid <b>for,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> facilities will be provided by the airport operator to the police force. PSAs do not cover responses to emergencies (both day-to-day emergencies and those covered by the Civil Contingencies Act 2004), extra police provision for hijack designated airports, border control work or protection against man-portable air-defense systems. The new Framework also includes expanded powers of dispute resolution for the Secretary of State for Transport, and provides for recourse to judicial review by the High Court.|$|E
500|$|He {{had built}} a {{reputation}} as an innovative teacher, so when he was cast as the lead in Grand Street Follies of 1928, he was also appointed the choreographer. The show received rave reviews and was followed by Grand Street Follies of 1929. These roles led to a part in George Kelly's Maggie the Magnificent, a play the critics disliked, though they liked Cagney's performance. Cagney saw this role (and Women Go on Forever) as significant because of the talented directors he met. He learned [...] "...what a director was <b>for</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> a director could do. They were directors who could play all the parts in the play better than the actors cast for them." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1994, Larry Kasanoff and his {{production}} company, Threshold Entertainment, held {{the rights to}} do a live-action G.I. Joe film with Warner Bros. as the distributor, but instead chose to concentrate the company's efforts upon its Mortal Kombat films. As late as 1999, there had been rumors that a film from Threshold Entertainment was still a possibility, but that project never panned out. In 2003, Lorenzo di Bonaventura was interested in making a film about advanced military technology; Hasbro's Brian Goldner called him and suggested to base the film on the G.I. Joe toy line. Goldner and di Bonaventura worked together before, creating toy lines for films di Bonaventura had produced as CEO of Warner Bros. Goldner and di Bonaventura spent three months working out a story, and chose Michael B. Gordon as screenwriter, because they liked his script for 300. Di Bonaventura wanted to depict the origin story of certain characters, and introduced the new character of Rex, to allow an exploration of Duke. Rex's name came from Hasbro. Beforehand, Don Murphy was interested in filming the property, but when the Iraq War broke out, he considered the subject matter inappropriate, and chose to develop Transformers (another Hasbro toy line) instead. Di Bonaventura related, [...] "What [...] stand <b>for,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> Duke stands for specifically in the movie, is something that I'd like to think a worldwide audience might connect with." ...|$|E
2500|$|Allmusic {{staff writer}} Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album {{four and a}} half out of five stars. He said, [...] "This is further proof that Pearl Jam {{consciously}} turned away from the big, anthemic sound and spirit that won them a mass audience with Ten—they still had the songs and sound, they just chose to bury it. Lost Dogs crackles with that passion and it has another advantage: unlike most of Pearl Jam's albums, it's a fun, compulsive listen. More than any other album in its catalog, Lost Dogs captures what Pearl Jam stood <b>for</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> it felt like at their peak." [...] Rolling Stone staff writer David Fricke gave the album three out of five stars, saying that [...] "for an album of odds 'n' sods, Lost Dogs sure sounds a lot like a pack of hits." ...|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Parasite", Bennet is {{questioned}} by Thompson; {{he claims that}} {{the last thing he}} remembers is driving home Sandra from the hospital. Later, before Noah Bennet is about to leave on business, Sandra tells him that she is only pretending to have had her mind wiped, as he told her to do; and that he had told her everything about what he really did, who he works <b>for,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> happened to Claire. She gives him a note that he left for himself, warning him not to look for Claire because she is with friends. Then, Bennet and Candice travel to New York to [...] "clean up" [...] Isaac's mess. Upon his return home, Bennet tells Sandra that they both have to pretend that they have no idea what has happened, and that Primatech has to be stopped for good to ensure Claire's safety. [...] "Sandra" [...] then transforms back into Candice, {{and other members of the}} Company, including Thompson, enter the room behind her.|$|E

2500|$|The Phaedrus {{also gives}} us {{much in the}} way of {{explaining}} how art should be practiced. The discussion of rhetoric, the proper practice of which is found to actually be philosophy, has many similarities with Socrates's role as a [...] "midwife of the soul" [...] in the Theaetetus; the dialectician, as described, is particularly resonant. To practice the art, one must have a grasp of the truth and a detailed understanding of the soul in order to properly persuade. Moreover, one must have an idea of what is good or bad for the soul and, as a result, know what the soul should be persuaded towards. To have mastered the tools of an art is not to have mastered the art itself, but only its preliminaries. This is much like the person who claims to have mastered harmony after learning the highest and lowest notes of the lyre. To practice an art, one must know what that art is <b>for</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> it can help one achieve.|$|E
2500|$|Microsoft {{considered}} several {{names for}} its new operating system. In the end, Microsoft chose Windows Vista as confirmed on July 22, 2005, believing {{it to be a}} [...] "wonderful intersection of what the product really does, what Windows stands <b>for,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> resonates with customers, and their needs." [...] Group Project Manager Greg Sullivan told Paul Thurrott—"You want the PC to adapt to you and help you cut through the clutter to focus on what’s important to you. That's what Windows Vista is all about: [...] "bringing clarity to your world." [...] (a reference to the three marketing points of Vista—Clear, Connected, Confident), so you can focus on what matters to you." [...] Microsoft co-president Jim Allchin also liked the name, saying that [...] "Vista" [...] creates the right imagery for the new product capabilities and inspires the imagination with all the possibilities of what can be done with Windows—making people’s passions come alive." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{is unclear}} {{what has been}} spent so far on {{planning}} and preparing for each pilot cull and who exactly is paying for what, i.e. what taxpayers are paying <b>for</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> the farming industry is paying for. Costings of the culls have not factored in socio-economic costs, such as tourism and any potential boycotts of dairy products from the cull zones. Others opposed to the cull argue that for economic reasons the government have chosen the most inhumane approach to disease eradication. Tony Dean, Chairperson of the Gloucestershire Badger Group, warns that some badgers will not be killed outright: [...] "You {{have got to be}} a good marksman to kill a badger outright, with one shot... Many of the badgers will be badly injured. They will go back underground after being shot, probably badly maimed. They will die a long lingering death underground from lead poisoning etc. We {{are going to have a}} lot of cubs left underground where their mothers have been shot above ground." [...] He also suggests that domestic pets will be at risk in the cull areas, as some farmers will mistake black and white cats and dogs for badgers.|$|E
