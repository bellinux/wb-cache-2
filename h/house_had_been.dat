5|$|Henry Strachey, the {{grandson}} of the geologist and a senior civil servant, was created a baronet in 1801. When he inherited {{the house in the}} 18th century the <b>house</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> mortgaged, however the mortgage was paid by Strachey's employer Clive of India.|$|E
5|$|The 1902 Education Act {{also made}} it a legal {{requirement}} for the County Council to provide an equal educational opportunity for girls. A conference was held in October 1903 to discuss the founding of a girls' school, and by January 1905 Wisbech High School for Girls was established in Harecroft House on the North Brink. The <b>house</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> donated on a long-term lease for the purpose by the Peckover family. Harecroft <b>House</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> built in 1844 by Algernon Peckover, and his descendants {{lived in the house}} until the death of Susannah Peckover in 1903, after which it was left vacant. The first headmistress was Beatrice Sparks, who was the first woman to complete the Oxford Tripos in mathematics. New schoolrooms were added to the High School in 1906, 1913, 1922 and 1936, when a mixed-use gymnasium and hall was constructed. This hall was, until recently, used as the school dining room and will from 2017 be the school's library. Originally, the High School was also able to take boarders, which continued until after World War II.|$|E
5|$|The Magistrate {{after hearing}} {{the whole of the}} Case {{observed}} that however valuable the books might be from which the leaves found in Mr Accum’s <b>house</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> taken, yet the leaves separated from them were only waste paper. If they had weighed a pound he would have committed him for the value of a pound of waste paper, but this not being the case he discharged him.|$|E

5|$|The couple {{bought the}} Georgian five-bay villa (built around 1830) for £48,000 at auction in 1968, {{along with its}} eight acres of land, and lived there until 1976. The <b>house</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{registered}} as a Grade II listed building in 1949 under the name Gladsmuir, previously known as Gladsmuir House. Jane Howard restored an earlier name, Lemmons; the next owners changed it back to Gladsmuir.|$|E
5|$|The last operatic {{music to}} be heard in the old <b>house</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> the finale of Falstaff, {{conducted}} by Solti with the singers led by Bryn Terfel, in a joint opera and ballet farewell gala in July 1997. When the house reopened in December 1999, magnificently restored, Falstaff was the opera given on the opening night, conducted by Haitink, once more with Terfel in the title role.|$|E
5|$|Between 1820 and 1828 {{the earl}} had {{converted}} the abandoned tennis {{court and the}} Castle Inn – which he closed in 1812 after buying the castle – into a new, grand building, called Castle House, overlooking {{the north side of}} the outer bailey. By the 1840s the <b>house</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> leased out, first to George Hodges and his family, and then to William Urwick and to Robert Marston, all important members of the local landowning classes. The mansion included a drawing room, dining room, study, servants' quarters, a conservatory and grapevines, and in 1887 was worth £50 a year in rent.|$|E
50|$|In {{recent years}} there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a {{sustained}} {{effort to improve}} the area. Most of the post-war tenement <b>housing</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> demolished or refurbished, and new private <b>housing</b> <b>has</b> also <b>been</b> built.|$|R
5000|$|Strong {{legislation}} in England and Wales provides {{a mechanism for}} police and local authorities to close crack <b>houses</b> which <b>have</b> <b>been</b> associated with disorder or serious nuisance.

50|$|By 1971, 364 homes {{designed}} for low-income Indian families to purchase or rehabilitate housing and 116 units of low-rent <b>housing</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> finished, {{with an additional}} 274 homes under construction. By 1973, 885 <b>houses</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> completed and were occupied and an additional 331 were under construction.|$|R
5|$|In 1818 a {{golf course}} was founded on the moor for the Manchester Golf Club, a group of Manchester businessmen, {{some of whom had}} emigrated from Scotland. This was only the second course to be built outside Scotland. The course at that time {{consisted}} of only five holes and had no fairways or greens as the players had to share the ground with other users. The club was very exclusive and by 1825 a club <b>house</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> built on Singleton Road. By 1869 the course had increased to nine holes and the club continued playing on the moor until 1862 when a new course was built a few hundred yards away at Kersal Vale.|$|E
5|$|In 1901 Gaudí {{decorated}} {{the house of}} Isabel Güell López, Marchioness of Castelldosrius, and daughter of Eusebi Güell. Situated at 19 Carrer Junta de Comerç, the <b>house</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> built in 1885 and renovated between 1901 and 1904; it was destroyed by a bomb during the Civil War. The following year Gaudí {{took part in the}} decoration of the Bar Torino, property of Flaminio Mezzalana, located at 18 Passeig de Gràcia; Gaudí designed the ornamentation of el Salón Árabe of that establishment, made with varnished Arabian-style cardboard tiles (which no longer exist).|$|E
5|$|Jane Howard {{found that}} the house had {{previously}} been called Lemmons, and decided to restore that name. It was known as Gladsmuir when they bought it—from Gladsmuir Heath, the former name of Hadley Common, site of the Battle of Barnet in 1471 during the Wars of the Roses. The <b>house</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> registered under that name as a Grade II listed building in 1949, previously known as Gladsmuir House, with an address in Hadley Wood Road. As of 2014 the address was listed as Hadley Common.|$|E
50|$|It is not {{uncommon}} to find that <b>houses</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> adapted and renovated over the ages and many have several different building materials co-existing within the one building. Renovation is not a modern initiative, Marseillan <b>houses</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> renovated and adapted since they were first built.|$|R

5|$|Morrissey {{was born}} in the Kensington area of Liverpool, the son of Joe, a cobbler, and Joan, who worked for Littlewoods. He was their fourth child, {{following}} brothers Tony and Paul, and sister Karen Lane. The family lived at 45 Seldon Street, in the Kensington district of Liverpool. For National Museums Liverpool's Eight Hundred Lives project, Morrissey wrote that the <b>house</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in his family since {{around the turn of the}} 20th century. His grandmother had been married there and his mother was born there. In 1971, the family moved to a larger, modern house on the new estates at Knotty Ash, and Seldon Street was later demolished.|$|E
5|$|The 300-seat {{theater was}} {{designed}} by Charles A. Duke in 1913 and opened in 1915 as The Clinton. Its main entrance faced 26th Avenue until 1922. The venue {{became known as the}} 26th Avenue Theatre in 1945 and the Encore in 1969, before reverting to a variation of its original name on May 30, 1975. At that time, a five-person collective bought the theater. The movie <b>house</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> showing X-rated films, which the collective replaced {{with a wide variety of}} movies including foreign films, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, and older films like The African Queen.|$|E
5|$|The manor of Southcote {{remained}} in the Blagrave family until the early 20th century, when it was owned by Henry Barry Blagrave. Henry died in 1927, though the manor house was demolished in 1921 after lying empty {{following the death of}} Wastel Brisco and his wife Sarah in 1891 and 1901 respectively. In 1920 the <b>house</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> purchased by a contractor with intentions to demolish the site, though the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings organised a committee to attempt to raise money to save the house. The Sphere reported that the bricks and oak panelling were in demand and were likely removed for re-use before the building's demolition.|$|E

50|$|The {{site is a}} 40 acre parcel near a small creek about 15 ft {{below the}} house. Springs near the <b>house</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> dammed by a wall aligned with the piano bay's angled wall, forming a small pond. The <b>house</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{modified}} and somewhat enlarged, with consultation from Taliesin.|$|R

5|$|The {{scenery and}} {{background}} of the story was meticulously copied from existing sources; car model types like the Opel Olympia 38 in which Calculus' abductors escaped the police were drawn from real examples, while Hergé closely adhered {{to the reality of}} the port and docks at Saint-Nazaire. Professor Tarragon's house was drawn from a real house in Avenue Delleur, Boitsfort, which Jacobs had identified for Hergé's purposes. Hergé and Jacobs stationed themselves outside the house and completed a sketch of the building. Immediately after, two grey cars containing German soldiers pulled up; the <b>house</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> requisitioned by the Schutzstaffel (SS). Hergé realised that, had he and Jacobs been discovered sketching, they would have been interrogated.|$|E
5|$|Work {{began in}} about 1735 and {{continued}} until Dashwood's death in 1781, when the older <b>house</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> transformed inside and out. The long building time partly explains the flaws and variations in design: when building commenced, Palladianism was {{the height of}} fashion, {{but by the time}} of its completion, Palladianism had been succeeded by Neoclassicism; thus, the house is a marriage of both styles. While the marriage is not completely unhappy, the Palladian features are marred by the lack of Palladio's proportions: the east portico is asymmetrical with the axis of the house, and trees were planted either side to draw the eye away from the flaw.|$|E
5|$|A water-powered mill in {{the castle}} grounds was {{probably}} built under Henry de Beaumont, 1stEarl of Warwick. By 1398 the mill had been relocated to just outside the eastern castle walls, {{on the west bank}} of the River Avon. Both mills were subject to flooding. By 1644, an engine <b>house</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> added to the mill. The mill was reused as an electricity generating plant after it had stopped being used to grind, but once Warwick Castle was fitted with mains electricity in 1940, the mill was no longer required and was dismantled in 1954. Adjacent to the mill is The Mill Garden which is privately owned but open to the public. Interesting views of the castle can be seen from this garden.|$|E

5|$|In 1952, the {{two couples}} {{discovered}} that Red House {{was up for}} sale, and as architects {{with an interest in}} Morris, they recognised its historic value. By this point, the Red <b>House</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> empty for 18 months, after Thomas Hills and his family had left in 1951, and had fallen into a state of dilapidation. Deciding to share the property between themselves, they were able to afford a mortgage {{with the aid of a}} loan from Toms' father-in-law; he only agreed to provide the loan if the house was owned in Toms' name, and thus the Hollambys became Toms' tenants. The two families then moved in with their six children, and a seventh was born soon after. They camped in the house's grounds while carrying out a project of renovation.|$|E
5|$|On 30 August 2011, CERA added Radio Network House to {{the list}} of {{buildings}} to be demolished. On 17 July 2012, the local Canterbury newspaper The Press reported that implosion of Radio Network <b>House</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> approved by CERA. The same day, a press conference was held, where representatives of the demolition companies involved and of CERA addressed the media. The main contractor for the demolition was Naylor Love, who engaged Ceres New Zealand for the implosion. Ceres in turn partnered with Controlled Demolition, Inc., an American company based in Phoenix, Maryland, that has a track record of 9,000 implosions and is considered a world leader in the field. The implosion of Radio Network House was a test case, as the technique had not been applied in New Zealand before, and there are still many more tall buildings to be demolished in Christchurch. The implosion was challenging for Controlled Demolition, Inc., as New Zealand buildings are designed to withstand earthquake loading and thus have much more reinforcing in them than the buildings they usually deal with.|$|E
5|$|Palladianism {{became popular}} briefly in Britain during the mid-17th century, but its {{flowering}} {{was cut short}} by {{the onset of the}} English Civil War and the imposition of austerity which followed. In the early 18th century it returned to fashion, not only in England but also, directly influenced from Britain, in Prussia. Count Francesco Algarotti may have written to Burlington from Berlin that he was recommending to Frederick the Great the adoption in Prussia of the architectural style Burlington had introduced in England but Knobelsdorff's opera house on the Unter den Linden, based on Campbell's Wanstead <b>House,</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> constructed from 1741. Later in the century, when the style was falling from favour in Europe, it had a surge in popularity throughout the British colonies in North America, highlighted by examples such as Drayton Hall in South Carolina, the Redwood Library in Newport, Rhode Island, the Morris-Jumel Mansion in New York City, the Hammond-Harwood House in Annapolis, Maryland and Thomas Jefferson's Monticello and Poplar Forest in Virginia.|$|E
