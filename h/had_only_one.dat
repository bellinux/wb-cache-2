According to their October 1942 organizational structure, an airborne division had 44 37mm anti-tank guns: four in divisional artillery (AA/AT battery of parachute field artillery battalion), 24 in the AA/AT battalion, and eight {{in each of}} two glider infantry regiments; parachute infantry regiments did not have anti-tank guns. In practice, airborne divisions often <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> glider infantry regiment and therefore 36 guns.|$|E

5|$|Magnus co-ruled with Olaf {{following}} his brother's return to Norway, {{but less than}} three years into his reign, Magnus became ill and died.

Fifty-one percent of women reporting homosexual experience <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> partner. Women with post-graduate education had a higher prevalence of homosexual experience, followed by women with a college education; the smallest occurrence was among women with education no higher than eighth grade. However, Kinsey's methodology was criticized.|$|E

Between 1893 and 1894, Hawaii was under the Provisional Government of Hawaii, with no formal leader. Before 1893, Hawaii was a monarchy; see list of monarchs of Hawaii.|$|E

Later that year, in May, U-6 became entangled in anti-submarine netting deployed {{as part of}} the Otranto Barrage. Coming under fire from Royal Navy's drifters running the nets, U-6 was abandoned and sunk. All of her crewmen were rescued and were held in captivity {{through the end of the}} war.|$|E

Instead of opting to use reserve opener Brown to replace Barnes, Australia played Hassett out of position to partner Morris, while Harvey took a middle-order slot.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} early van der Weyden {{depictions of the}} Madonna, her head is {{slightly}} too large for her body. Her dress is creased and almost paper-like. However, the description of her lap contains inconsistencies also in Campin's Virgin and Child before a Firescreen; it appears to lack volume and is if she <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> leg. This seems to reflect an early difficulty both with foreshortening and in the depiction of a body under clothing.|$|E

Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agricultural University, one of Asia's biggest agricultural universities was the first university established in Hisar, in 1971.

5|$|Before {{the treaty}} was signed, German {{soldiers}} had already entered {{the port of}} Klaipėda. Adolf Hitler, on board the cruiser Deutschland, personally toured the city and gave a short speech. The armada sailing to Klaipėda included the cruiser Admiral Graf Spee, the light cruisers Nürnberg, Leipzig, and Köln, two destroyer squadrons, three torpedo boat flotillas, and one tender flotilla. At the time the Lithuanian navy <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> warship, the Prezidentas Smetona, a 580-ton converted minesweeper.

This was because Color Air was not linked to the Amadeus booking system, owing to the costs associated with membership.|$|E

Former coach and contemporary university president Dr. Harry C. Byrd allocated funds {{for the construction of}} a stadium in 1915, and it was completed in 1923. The Board of Regents voted to name it Byrd Stadium in honor of its main advocate. The stadium's capacity was 5,000. During this time, it was common for Maryland to play its better-drawing games in larger stadiums in Washington, D.C. or Baltimore.|$|E

Although Johnson had begun {{his career as a}} relatively cautious publisher of religious and scientific tracts, he was now able to take more risks and he encouraged friends to recommend works to him, creating a network of informal reviewers. Yet Johnson's business was never large; he usually <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> assistant and never took on an apprentice.

Charles Dickens <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> paragraph on Æthelstan in his Child's History of England, and although Anglo-Saxon history was a popular subject for nineteenth-century artists, and Alfred was frequently depicted in paintings at the Royal Academy between 1769 and 1904, there was not one picture of Æthelstan.|$|E
