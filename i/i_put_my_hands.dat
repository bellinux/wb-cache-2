500|$|The parade scene took {{multiple}} days of filming; Broderick {{spent some}} time practicing the dance moves. [...] "I was very scared", Broderick said. [...] "Fortunately, the sequence was carefully choreographed beforehand. We worked out all the moves by rehearsing in a little studio. It was shot on two Saturdays {{in the heart of}} downtown Chicago. The first day was during a real parade, and John got some very long shots. Then radio stations carried announcements inviting people to take part in 'a John Hughes movie'. The word got around fast and 10,000 people showed up! For the final shot, I turned around and saw a river of people. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> {{up at the end of}} the number and heard this huge roar. I can understand how rock stars feel. That kind of reaction feeds you." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{took a deep}} breath. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> to {{the sides}} of my mouth. [...] "Cavor!" [...] I bawled, and the sound was like some manikin {{shouting}} far away.|$|E
60|$|And then revulsion took me, {{suddenly}} {{and without any}} cause or warning. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> to my face to shut out a vision whose true significance I realized as in a flash.|$|E
60|$|He {{had given}} me <b>my</b> cue. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> on his {{shoulder}} and spoke sorrowfully.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>'and</b> in <b>my</b> trowsis-pocket {{and looked}} at 'im. Then I walked very slow, towards the gate.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> to <b>my</b> sword, but Checco caught {{hold of my}} arm. I {{recovered}} {{myself at}} once.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> to {{the long}} red silk waist-cloth that was hanging out of the window, and we three pulled and pulled with all the {{strength}} at our command. There was something very heavy at the end, and it swore in an unknown tongue as it kicked against the City wall.|$|E
60|$|The emptiness! Ah, it {{was from}} that I shrank. I could have faced pain and anxiety and heartbreak undauntedly, but I could not face that terrible, yawning, barren emptiness. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> over my eyes to shut it out, but it pressed in upon my {{consciousness}} insistently, {{and would not be}} ignored longer.|$|E
6000|$|An unseen {{presence}} drew us together. My mother's face became resolute, commanding. I {{turned to}} Anna {{as a child}} may turn to its nurse. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> about her strong shoulders, she folded me to her, and my heart gave way. I buried my face in her breast and clung to her weakly, and burst into a passion of weeping. [...] .|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>’and</b> in <b>my</b> trowsis-pocket {{and looked}} at ’im. Then I walked very slow, towards the gate.|$|R
60|$|He gave such a {{start when}} <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> upon his shoulder, {{that he made}} me start too.|$|R
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> {{upon the}} door-knob, I heard steps upon the stairs, {{and looking up}} saw Duncan Woodward descending.|$|R
6000|$|As we {{contemplated}} the fire, and as I thought what a difficult vision {{to realize this}} same Capital sometimes was, <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> in my pockets. A folded {{piece of paper in}} one of them attracting my attention, I opened it and found it to be the play-bill I had received from Joe, relative to the celebrated provincial amateur of Roscian renown. [...] "And bless my heart," [...] I involuntarily added aloud, [...] "it's to-night!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{she threw}} herself {{down on the sofa}} and she sobbed--I never heard a girl cry like that in all my life. She shrieked, she was pretty nearly in hysterics, and I couldn't get a word out of her. When she was through at last, she was all limp and white. She wouldn't tell me anything. She simply sat and looked at the stove. Presently she got up to go. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> on her {{shoulders}} and I forced her back in the chair.|$|E
6000|$|... "Till now I {{had hardly}} {{thought of the}} diamonds; <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> to my {{waistband}} and found, as I expected, that they were gone. I think I felt nothing but pleasure: the confounded things had given trouble enough, and I was well rid of them. Why they should have spared my life I could not imagine. If they had finished me, which {{they could have done}} without any risk to themselves when they got me ashore, they could have gone off with the diamonds without the slightest fear of pursuit, while now there was, of course, a chance that I might follow and recognize them." ...|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{the thought}} struck {{me to try}} a bit of deception. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> in <b>my</b> pocket and drew out the empty envelope.|$|R
60|$|How could I resist that? <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> on his shoulder, {{and tried}} to make him lift up his head and look at me.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>'and</b> in <b>my</b> pocket. Then <b>I</b> <b>put</b> it in {{the other}} one, and arter that I stood staring at George Tebb and shaking all over.|$|R
6000|$|... "So Meinik scared them away," [...] {{the latter}} said, as Stanley {{sat down beside}} him. [...] "I could not think {{what he was going}} to do when he came up here with that long reed, as thick as my leg. He showed it to me, and I saw that it had a sort of {{mouthpiece}} fixed into it; and he made signs that he was going to blow down it. When he did, it was tremendous and, as it got louder and louder, <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> to my ears. Everything seemed to quiver. The other row--that diabolical laughing noise--he made with a smaller one. It was frightful; but the big note was more like a trombone, only twenty times louder.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{began the}} most arduous {{undertaking}} {{mentioned in the}} [...] "York----," [...] I mean in history. Lighting my pipe, and fixing my eye upon the ink and paper, <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> behind my back and took my departure from the hearthrug toward the Interior. Language fails me; I throw myself upon the reader's imagination. Before I had taken two steps, my vision alighted upon the circular of a quack physician, which I had brought home the day before around a bottle of hair-wash. I now saw the words, [...] "Twenty-one fevers!" [...] This prostrated me for I know not how long. Recovering, I took a step forward, when my eyes fastened themselves upon my pen-wiper, worked into the similitude of a tiger. This compelled me to retreat to the hearthrug for reinforcements. The red-and-white dog displayed upon that article turned a deaf ear to my entreaties; nothing would move him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have seen}} her," [...] she said, [...] "and {{have given her}} the message. I {{could see that she}} {{understood}} it, but as there were other women round, she made no sign. I told the mistress of the zenana that you had given me some magic words that I was to whisper to her to prepare the way for the philter, so she let me in without difficulty, and I was allowed to go close up to her and repeat your message. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> on her before I did so, and I think she felt that it was the touch of a friend. She hushed up when I spoke to her. The mistress, who was standing close by, thought that this was a sign {{of the power of the}} words I had spoken to her. I did not stay more than a minute. I was afraid she might try to speak to me in your tongue, and that would have been dangerous." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> on hers. [...] "Don't quit, Nan. You'll {{never forgive}} {{yourself}} if you quit. Take it from me, Whit will pull out of this hole!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush, Jonathan," [...] said I; [...] "there's the First Duff looking up. Be still! the Emperor {{will hear}} you;" [...] and <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> on his mouth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha-nor do I. If I did I should {{soon find}} my mistake out. If <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> {{out to take}} anything, <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> is very soon bitten, I can tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|But along {{whichever}} road I might fight {{my way to}} the Elysian Fields of fame, education, I dimly {{but most}} certainly comprehended, was a necessary weapon to my hand. And so, with aching heart and aching head, I pored over my many books. I see myself now in my small bedroom, my elbows planted on the shaky, one-legged table, startled every now and again by the frizzling of my hair coming in contact with the solitary candle. On cold nights I wear my overcoat, turned up about the neck, a blanket round my legs, and often I must sit with my fingers in my ears, the better to shut out the sounds of life, rising importunately from below. [...] "A song, Of a song, To a song, A song, O! song!" [...] "I love, Thou lovest, He she or it loves. I should or would love" [...] over and over again, till my own voice seems some strange buzzing thing about me, while my head grows smaller and smaller till <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> up frightened, wondering if it still be entire upon my shoulders.|$|E
6000|$|Instead of {{answering}} me, he shrugged his shoulders, and pointing to [...] {{the sky with}} his finger, he cried: The star! the star! When Nature [...] made Leo, Vinci, Pergolese, Duni, she smiled. She put on a grave [...] and imposing air in shaping my dear uncle Rameau, who for half a [...] score years they will have called the great Rameau, and of whom [...] very soon nobody will say a word. When she tricked up his nephew, [...] she made a grimace, and a grimace, and again a grimace. [And as he [...] said this, he put on all sorts of odd expressions: contempt, [...] disdain, irony; {{and he seemed to}} be kneading between his fingers a [...] piece of paste, and to be smiling at the ridiculous shapes that he [...] gave it; that done, he flung the incongruous pagod[225] away from [...] him, and said:] It was thus she made me, and flung me by the side [...] of the other pagods, some with huge wrinkled paunches, and short [...] necks, and great eyes projecting out of their heads, stamped with [...] apoplexy; others with wry necks; some again with wizened faces, [...] keen eyes, hooked noses. All were ready to split with laughing when [...] they espied me, and <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> to my sides and split with [...] laughter when I espied them, for fools and madmen tickle one [...] another; they seek and attract one another. If when I got among [...] them, I had not found ready-made the proverb about the money of [...] fools being the patrimony of people with wits, they would have [...] been indebted to me for it. I felt that nature had put my lawful [...] inheritance into the purses of the pagods, and I devised a thousand [...] means of recovering my rights.|$|E
6000|$|It is hard {{to forget}} repulsive things. I {{remember}} yet how I ran off from school once, when I was a boy, and then, pretty late at night, concluded to climb into the window of my father's office and sleep on a lounge, because I had a delicacy about going home and getting thrashed. As I lay on the lounge and my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, I fancied I could see a long, dusky, shapeless thing stretched upon the floor. A cold shiver went through me. I turned my face to the wall. That did not answer. I was afraid that that thing would creep over and seize me in the dark. I turned back and stared at it for minutes and minutes--they seemed hours. It appeared {{to me that the}} lagging moonlight never, never would get to it. I turned to the wall and counted twenty, to pass the feverish time away. I looked--the pale square was nearer. I turned again and counted fifty--it was almost touching it. With desperate will I turned again and counted one hundred, and faced about, all in a tremble. A white human hand lay in the moonlight! Such an awful sinking at the heart--such a sudden gasp for breath! I felt--I cannot tell what I felt. When I recovered strength enough, I faced the wall again. But no boy could have remained so with that mysterious hand behind him. I counted again and looked--the most of a naked arm was exposed. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> over my eyes and counted till I could stand it no longer, and then --the pallid face of a man was there, with the corners of the mouth drawn down, and the eyes fixed and glassy in death! I raised to a sitting posture and glowered on that corpse till the light crept down the bare breastline by line--inch by inch--past the nipple--and then it disclosed a ghastly stab! ...|$|E
60|$|Her ear! The dear little ear which I had kissed so often. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> to each little velvet shell to {{make certain}} that this sacrilege had not yet been committed.|$|R
60|$|Before I {{had reached}} the lodge, where I had left my bicycle, I met Brownster, and when I saw him <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> into <b>my</b> pocket. He had {{certainly}} been very attentive.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> {{under his}} shirt and felt. The skin was {{stretched}} like parchment over the bones, and the sensation produced was {{for all the world}} like running one's hand over a washboard.|$|R
6000|$|... 47. Pictorial enough, I repeat; and yet I {{might not}} now have remembered her, {{so as to}} find her figure mingling, against my will, with other images, but for her manner of [...] "revival." [...] For one of her playmates coming near, cast some word at her which angered her; and she rose--"en ego, victa situ"--she rose with a single spring, like a snake; one hardly saw the motion; and with a shriek so shrill that <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> upon my ears; and so uttered herself, indignant and vengeful, with words of justice,--Alecto {{standing}} by, satisfied, teaching her acute, articulate syllables, and adding her own voice to carry them thrilling through the blue laurel shadows. And having spoken, she went her way, wearily: and I passed by on the other side, meditating, with such Levitical propriety as a respectable person should, on the asplike Passion, following the sorrowful Patience; {{and on the way}} in which the saying, [...] "Dust shalt thou eat all thy days" [...] has been confusedly fulfilled, first by much provision of human dust for the meat of what Keats calls [...] "human serpentry;" [...] and last, by gathering the Consumed and Consumer into dust together, for the meat of the death spirit, or serpent Apap. Neither could I, for long, get rid of the thought of this strange dust-manufacture under the mill-stones, as it were, of Death; and of the two colors of the grain, discriminate beneath, though indiscriminately cast into the hopper. For indeed some of it seems only to be made whiter for its patience, and becomes kneadable into spiced bread, where they sell in Babylonian shops [...] "slaves, and souls of men;" [...] but other some runs dark from under the mill-stones; a little sulphurous and nitrous foam being mingled in the conception of it; and is ominously stored up in magazines near river-embankments; patient enough--for the present.|$|E
6000|$|My first funeral, a fair {{representative}} funeral {{after its}} kind, {{was that of}} the husband of a married servant, once my nurse. She married for money. Sally Flanders, after a year or two of matrimony, became the relict of Flanders, a small master builder; and either she or Flanders had done me the honour to express a desire that I should 'follow.' I may have been seven or eight years old;--young enough, certainly, to feel rather alarmed by the expression, as not knowing where the invitation was held to terminate, and how far I was expected to follow the deceased Flanders. Consent being given by the heads of houses, I was jobbed up into what was pronounced at home decent mourning (comprehending somebody else's shirt, unless my memory deceives me), and was admonished that if, when the funeral was in action, <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> in my pockets, or took my eyes out of my pocket-handkerchief, I was personally lost, and my family disgraced. On the eventful day, having tried to get myself into a disastrous frame of mind, and having formed a very poor opinion of myself because I couldn't cry, I repaired to Sally's. Sally was an excellent creature, and had been a good wife to old Flanders, but the moment I saw her I knew that she was not in her own real natural state. She formed a sort of Coat of Arms, grouped with a smelling-bottle, a handkerchief, an orange, a bottle of vinegar, Flanders's sister, her own sister, Flanders's brother's wife, and two neighbouring gossips--all in mourning, and all ready to hold her whenever she fainted. At sight of poor little me she became much agitated (agitating me much more), and having exclaimed, 'O here's dear Master Uncommercial!' became hysterical, and swooned as if I had been the death of her. An affecting scene followed, during which I was handed about and poked at her by various people, as if I were the bottle of salts. Reviving a little, she embraced me, said, 'You knew him well, dear Master Uncommercial, and he knew you!' and fainted again: which, {{as the rest of the}} Coat of Arms soothingly said, 'done her credit.' Now, I knew that she needn't have fainted unless she liked, and that she wouldn't have fainted unless it had been expected of her, quite as well as I know it at this day. It made me feel uncomfortable and hypocritical besides. I was not sure but that it might be manners in ME to faint next, and I resolved to keep my eye on Flanders's uncle, and if I saw any signs of his going in that direction, to go too, politely. But Flanders's uncle (who was a weak little old retail grocer) had only one idea, which was that we all wanted tea; and he handed us cups of tea all round, incessantly, whether we refused or not. There was a young nephew of Flanders's present, to whom Flanders, it was rumoured, had left nineteen guineas. He drank all the tea that was offered him, this nephew--amounting, I should say, to several quarts--and ate as much plum-cake as he could possibly come by; but he felt it to be decent mourning that he should now and then stop in the midst of a lump of cake, and appear to forget that his mouth was full, in the contemplation of his uncle's memory. I felt all this to be the fault of the undertaker, who was handing us gloves on a tea-tray as if they were muffins, and tying us into cloaks (mine had to be pinned up all round, it was so long for me), because I knew that he was making game. So, when we got out into the streets, and I constantly disarranged the procession by tumbling on the people before me because my handkerchief blinded my eyes, and tripping up the people behind me because my cloak was so long, I felt that we were all making game. I was truly sorry for Flanders, but I knew that it was no reason why we should be trying (the women with their heads in hoods like coal-scuttles with the black side outward) to keep step with a man in a scarf, carrying a thing like a mourning spy-glass, which he was going to open presently and sweep the horizon with. I knew that we should not all have been speaking in one particular key-note struck by the undertaker, if we had not been making game. Even in our faces we were every one of us as like the undertaker as if we had been his own family, and I perceived that this could not have happened unless we had been making game. When we returned to Sally's, it was all of a piece. The continued impossibility of getting on without plum-cake; the ceremonious apparition of a pair of decanters containing port and sherry and cork; Sally's sister at the tea-table, clinking the best crockery and shaking her head mournfully every time she looked down into the teapot, as if it were the tomb; the Coat of Arms again, and Sally as before; lastly, the words of consolation administered to Sally when it was considered right that she should 'come round nicely:' which were, that the deceased had had 'as com-for-ta-ble a fu-ne-ral as comfortable could be!' ...|$|E

60|$|The boarder was {{standing}} in the middle of the dining-room, into which the stairs led. I could not see him, but <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> against him as I was feeling my way across the floor.|$|R
