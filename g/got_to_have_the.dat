The decision was taken in secret by a small Cabinet committee. Bevin told the committee in October 1946, that 'We've got to have this thing over here whatever it costs … We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> bloody Union Jack flying on top of it.' It {{was a matter of}} both prestige and national security. Those ministers who would have opposed the bomb on grounds of cost, Hugh Dalton and Sir Stafford Cripps, were excluded from the meeting in January 1947 at which the final decision was taken.|$|E

This partly {{resulted}} from the arrest for espionage of Alan Nunn May in February 1946. On 8 January 1947, Attlee formed a secret Gen 163 Cabinet committee, consisting of six cabinet ministers, which decided that Britain required the atomic bomb to maintain its position in world politics. In the words of the Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin, [...] "That won't do at all... we've got to have this...

500|$|Meanwhile, Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) becomes {{engaged to}} her state senator boyfriend, Robert. Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez), who {{strongly}} believes that Robert is gay, shares his feelings with Pam. Ryan overhears them and confirms that Robert is gay, in his opinion. When {{the rest of}} the office thinks so as well, they must {{decide whether or not to}} tell Angela. They eventually decide not to tell Angela for a wide range of reasons—not everyone is sure Robert is gay, Oscar is looking forward to the elegant wedding, and Pam does not think it is anyone's right to blurt out that information. Angela is then typically rude about her nuptial plans—first sing-songing to an indifferent Stanley that they might not <b>have</b> room <b>to</b> invite him to the wedding, and then asking Pam if she can borrow the plans for the dream wedding Pam never <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have,</b> before mocking <b>the</b> ceremony where Pam and Jim got married at Niagara Falls.

When Lievaart proved unable to trace, having left the country with Gogol Bordello, the only alternative would have been Newman's swim~ studio, but as Newman explained to emusic.com, this {{would not have been}} suitable: [...] "I can produce fairly decent-sounding mixes here , but for physical recording, if you're going to record drums in a nice room, first of all you've got to have a nice room, and someone who knows how to record drums.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis explores {{determinants}} and moderators of {{suicidal ideation}} in Australia in three higher-risk populations: rural and remote residents, older adults, {{and people with}} co-occurring depression and substance misuse. It consists of an Introduction, nine papers and a final chapter providing a synthesis of the results and conclusion. At the time of submission, seven of <b>the</b> nine papers <b>have</b> been accepted for publication in peer reviewed journals, with two currently submitted for peer review. The Introduction {{provides an overview of}} suicidal thoughts and behaviours in Australia, summarising the current body of literature and drawing particular attention to higher-risk groups, established risk factors, and current treatments. Limitations in existing research are summarised in Paper 1 (“Urban-rural influences on suicidality: Gaps in the existing literature and recommendations for future research”). This section leads into a justification for the aims of this thesis and an outline of how they will be addressed. Chapter 2, Paper 2 (“Contributors to suicidality in rural communities: Beyond the effects of depression”) explores the extent of the relationship between depression and suicidal thoughts and behaviours in rural areas, determining that although these concepts are highly related, they remain independent. The discussion of this Chapter emphasises the variance in suicidal ideation not accounted for by depression, indicating the potential for other factors to contribute. This information is used to direct the analyses in Chapter 3. Chapter 3 explores the long-term risk factors for suicidal ideation within each of the key groups of rural residents, older adults, and people with a mental illness. Informed by Chapter 2, the papers presented in Chapter 3 incorporate a focus on social as well as psychiatric factors, while aiming to address the identified lack of longitudinal research investigating suicidal ideation. Longitudinal associations with suicidal ideation are explored in rural residents in Paper 3 (“You’ve <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> friends: <b>The</b> predictive value of social integration and support in suicidal ideation among rural communities”) and Paper 4 (“Longitudinal course and predictors of suicidal ideation in a rural community sample”); in older adults in Paper 5 ("Predictors of suicidal ideation in older people. A decision-tree analysis"); and in people with comorbid mental illness and substance use problems in Paper 6 (“Longitudinal risk profiles for suicidal ideation in comorbid depression and substance misuse”). Finally, Chapter 4 evaluates potential treatment options for suicidal thoughts and behaviours in terms of their accessibility, appeal, and efficiency. Rural residents are the focus of Paper 7 (“Facilitators and barriers to treatment-seeking for people with mental health problems in rural areas”) and Paper 8 (“Feasibility of internet-delivered mental health treatments for rural populations”), older adults are explored in Chapter 4. 3, while people with a comorbid mental illness provide the data presented in Paper 9 (“Incidental treatment effects of CBT on suicidal ideation and hopelessness”). While this Chapter identifies flexible treatment options that may increase the accessibility of services for people experiencing suicidal ideation, the importance of overcoming attitudinal barriers to help-seeking is emphasised; limitations in current clinical treatment approaches are also discussed. The Discussion section synthesises the findings of the nine papers presented in this thesis, with a focus on the implications and future directions indicated by this research. It outlines a proposed multi-tiered approach to suicide prevention, incorporating strategies ranging from epidemiological through to clinical treatment strategies. Future research directions are also suggested...|$|R

2500|$|Since {{coming out}} as a lesbian, Bianca's romantic {{entanglements}} have consisted of sexual confusion, unrequited love, bad timing, and betrayal, including a short-lived romance with Lena Kundera (Olga Sosnovska) and an on-but-mostly-off-screen romantic relationship with Maggie Stone (Elizabeth Hendrickson). The pairing of Reese and Bianca finally allowed the character to be scripted into an on-screen committed relationship.

I worked round at the saw-mills, and I was ostler a while at the hotel--I always DID like a good horse. Well, I WA'N'T exactly a college graduate, and I went to school odd times.

Let's go out and look at it.' So we drove out. I'd let the place for seventy-five dollars a year to a shif'less kind of a Kanuck that had come down that way; and I'd hated to see the house with him in it; but we drove out one Saturday afternoon, and we brought back about a bushel of the stuff in the buggy-seat, and I tried it crude, and I tried it burnt; and I liked it. M'wife she liked it too. There wa'n't any painter by trade in the village, and I mixed it myself. Well, sir, that tavern's got that coat of paint on it yet, and it hain't ever had any other, and I don't know's it ever will. Well, you know, I felt as if it was a kind of harumscarum experiment, all the while; and I presume I shouldn't have tried it but I kind of liked to do it because father'd always set so much store by his paint-mine. And when I'd got the first coat on,"--Lapham called it CUT,--"I presume I must have set as much as half an hour; looking at it and thinking how he would have enjoyed it. I've had my share of luck in this world, and I ain't a-going to complain on my OWN account, but I've noticed that most things get along too late for most people. It made me feel bad, and it took all the pride out my success with the paint, thinking of father. Seemed to me I might 'a taken more interest in it when he was by to see; but we've got to live and learn. Well, I called my wife out,--I'd tried it on the back of the house, you know,--and she left her dishes,--I can remember she came out with her sleeves rolled up and set down alongside of me on the trestle,--and says I, 'What do you think, Persis?' And says she, 'Well, you hain't got a paint-mine, Silas Lapham; you've got a GOLD-mine.' She always was just so enthusiastic about things. Well, it was just after two or three boats had burnt up out West, and a lot of lives lost, and there was a great cry about non-inflammable paint, and I guess that was what was in her mind. 'Well, I guess it ain't any gold-mine, Persis,' says I; 'but I guess it IS a paint-mine. I'm going to have it analysed, and if it turns out what I think it is, I'm going to work it.
