This study examined the accuracy of external measurement in estimating the actual length of insertion required in 130 patients. It also examined the relationship between the length inserted and the patient’s height in 126 patients and their weight in 125 patients. Although there was a fair correlation between the measured external length and the final inserted length (r= 0. 61), the 95 % confidence intervals of slope and intercept allowed a large variation and the prediction was too wide to be clinically useful. Height was reasonably well correlated with the final length (r= 0. 51) but an equally wide 95 % confidence interval rendered it of little clinical value. There was no correlation between weight and final tube length. It is concluded that external measurement alone is not adequate to predict a clinically acceptable position of the double-lumen tube. R.

40|$|The {{provision}} of care is an increasingly pressing {{issue in the}} Global North. With an ageing population and policies encouraging women into the labour market, {{there is a growing}} need for workers to undertake paid caring. This poses important and urgent questions about the social organisation of labour markets. Care work typically is low paid and undertaken in precarious, informal, or temporary situations. Many posts are filled by economic migrants, raising concerns about a care deficit in sending countries. In this paper we examine the 'caring work' undertaken by migrant workers in a West London hospital. We employ a twofold characterisation of caring work. Like other bottom-end service sector work, this work is characterised by the face-to-face 'emotional labour'. However, it also requires 'body work': close and often intimate physical contact between carers and those they care for. We argue that both of these aspects are important in understanding how caring work is constructed as poorly regarded and low paid. We show how these features play out in particular ways for migrant workers employed in such caring work.

Fetal adaptations to placental restriction maintain the growth of key organs, including the heart, but the impact of these adaptations on individual cardiomyocytes is unknown. Placental and hence fetal growth restriction was induced in fetal sheep by removing the majority of caruncles in the ewe before mating (placental restriction, PR). Vascular surgery was performed on 13 control and 11 PR fetuses at 110 – 125 days of gestation (term: 150 ± 3 days). PR fetuses with a mean gestational PO 2 135 days), fetal hearts were collected, and cardiomyocytes were isolated and fixed. Proliferating cardiomyocytes were counted by immunohistochemistry of Ki 67 protein. Cardiomyocytes were stained with methylene blue to visualize the nuclei, and the proportion of mononucleated cells and length and width of cardiomyocytes were measured. PR resulted in chronic fetal hypoxia, IUGR, and elevated plasma cortisol concentrations. Although {{there was no difference in}} relative heart weights between control and PR fetuses, there was an increase in the proportion of mononucleated cardiomyocytes in PR fetuses. Whereas mononucleated and binucleated cardiomyocytes were smaller, the relative size of cardiomyocytes when expressed relative to heart weight was larger in PR compared with control fetuses. The increase in the relative proportion of mononucleated cardiomyocytes and the relative sparing of the growth of individual cardiomyocytes in the growth-restricted fetus are adaptations that may have long-term consequences for heart development in postnatal life.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new method to test efficiently for cospeciation in tritrophic systems. Our method utilises an analogy with electrical circuit theory to reduce higher order systems into bitrophic data sets that retain the information of the original system. We use a sophisticated permutation scheme that weights interactions between two trophic layers based on their connection to the third layer in the system. Our method has several advantages compared to the method of Mramba et al. [Mramba, L. K., S. Barber, K. Hommola, L. A. <b>Dyer,</b> J. <b>S.</b> Wilson, M. L. Forister and W. R. Gilks (2013) : “Permutation tests for analyzing cospeciation in multiple phylogenies: applications in tri-trophic ecology,” Stat. Appl. Genet. Mol. Biol., 12, 679 – 701. ]. We do not require triangular interactions to connect the three phylogenetic trees and an easily interpreted p-value is obtained in one step. Another advantage of our method is the scope for generalisation to higher order systems and phylogenetic networks. The performance of our method is compared to the methods of Hommola et al. [Hommola, K., J. E. Smith, Y. Qiu and W. R. Gilks (2009) : “A permutation test of host–parasite cospeciation,” Mol. Biol. Evol., 26, 1457 – 1468. ] and Mramba et al. [Mramba, L. K., S. Barber, K.

It is a parasitic weed that penetrates the roots of other plants, diverting nutrients and water from the host plant and thus stunting their growth. Striga occurs mainly in cereal crops, such as maize, sorghum, fonio and millet, but Striga spp. also affects cowpeas and groundnuts. It has infested mainly the savanna areas in Africa and accounts for an estimated loss of 40 million tonnes of cereal annually continent-wide. Striga especially hits Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Mali, Nigeria, Sudan and Togo, but it is also present in the eastern and southern parts of the continent. In Kenya, striga is being fought off by planting desmodium (see box). The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) in Nigeria has devoted years to developing resistance in cereals against striga. By combining resistance in certain maize races with varieties that have a good production, IITA researchers have managed to breed striga tolerance in maize. Calliandra calothyrsus and Croton megalocarpus, both popular agroforestry tree species, release allelopathic (growth inhibiting) compounds into the environment which reduces striga infestation. The most straightforward method of weed control, after all is said and done, is probably through a acombination of measures such as intercropping with N-fixing and Striga repelling plants, and maintaining or increasing soil fertility.

Many people spend {{the majority of their}} time and effort in the homeplace and, in many instances, sustaining the homeplace {{is one of the major}} motivations of people 2 ̆ 7 s lives. Home is where we are first constructed, raise our families, share with our communities, work, grow old and possibly, wise. Contemporary critical studies, however, vastly underrepresents this instrumental site in the development of gender, race and class assumptions and dictates. The homeplace, as the work completed inside it, is devalued, demeaned and often times, ignored entirely. ^ To emphasize the home as a site in need of critical examination, I employ an approach that combines materialist feminism, theories of race and critiques of the outdated nineteenth-century theories of domesticity and the Cult of True Womanhood. By exposing both the ideological and material conditions of women 2 ̆ 7 s lives, I suggest ways in which the home determines women 2 ̆ 7 s lives and explore a contemporary critical discourse of domesticity.

Using an endogenous risk framework, the papers model weed control decisions {{as they are}} affected by uncertainty and as they are affected by policies aimed at reducing nonpoint source pollution;The first paper adapts the theory of self protection and self insurance to weed control decisions in order to model substitutions between fertilizer and herbicides. Our results suggest that {{an increase in the}} probability of weed damage will generally decrease both herbicide and fertilizer application rates. We also show that increased probability of weed damage leads to use of less persistent herbicides and less fertilizer. Also, nonpoint pollution policies which restrict fertilizer quantities will tend to reduce herbicide rates and herbicide persistence, while policies which restrict herbicide rates or herbicide persistence will tend to reduce fertilizer rates;The second paper models weed control decisions using the concepts of self insurance and self protection to model substitutions among the types and quantities of herbicides used. Our results indicate that policies which restrict herbicide rates likely lead to use of more persistent herbicides, while policies which restrict the use of persistent herbicides likely lead to increased application rates. We also provide conditions to unambiguously sign the effects of increased application or effectiveness risk on optimal herbicide choices. Generally, risk leads to a tradeoff between herbicide rates and herbicide persistence;The third paper uses a biophysical modeling approach to construct and evaluate the environmental and economic effects of alternative nonpoint source pollution policies. Environmental and economic tradeoffs are compared for six sets of policies including five sets of tax policies and one set of bans. Generally, herbicide targeted tax policies which are based on groundwater exposure values are most cost-efficient for producing relatively small improvements in water quality, while broad-based policies such as flat taxes and bans are most cost-efficient for producing larger improvements in water quality...|$|R
