5|$|A {{meeting of}} the {{parliamentary}} party was held on 15 September at which {{the issue of the}} presidential election was raised.

The extended meeting broke up without agreement. The parliamentary party met again on 20 September. Senator Ó Murchú withdrew his request for a nomination and a motion was passed that the party's Oireachtas members would not nominate or endorse any candidate.

5|$|Arrington and {{his assistants}} were {{supported}} {{by a team of}} editors, administrative assistants, research historians, oral history experts, and student interns. It was common for many individuals to work on a project; generally the principle author was listed in the article's byline, but sometimes Arrington's name was used to lend a publication authority. As a supervisor, Arrington was not a skillful bureaucrat, and junior staffers complained about their exclusion from decision-making and a lack of communication, which Arrington tried to ameliorate. Richard Bushman, a prominent Mormon historian, suggested that Arrington commission a multivolume history of the church, written mostly by scholars outside the history division staff. William Hartley, Gordon Irving, and Gary Shumway began an oral history program, funded {{by a grant from the}} descendants of James Moyle, a Utah politician. A summer research fellowship offered $1000 for outside scholars to use the LDS Church Archives for projects on Mormon history. Eugene England Sr. also donated money to support projects that Arrington deemed especially important.

5|$|Det norske Arbeiderforbund was {{supported}} by people <b>from</b> <b>individual</b> factories, but the mainly philanthropic activists {{were associated with the}} Liberal Party. However, the strike at Akers Mekaniske had been a failure, as the laborers had returned to work by on 26 Augustwith a 10% pay cut. It soon faced competition from more worker-dominated trade unions, coordinated through the Fagforeningenes Centralkomite. On the political side, a Labour Party was formed in 1887, and from it the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions followed in 1899. The historical role of Det norske Arbeiderforbund, as it turned out, was to mark the transition between two kinds of trade unionism; the one dominated by the bourgeois Liberal Party and the one dominated by the socialist Labour Party. The organization became defunct around 1890. The publication Arbeideren was continued, and beginning in 1906, Arbeideren was the party organ of the newly founded Labour Democrats, a non-socialist labour and social reform party associated with the Liberal Party.|$|E
5|$|Most {{taxes were}} due on {{each year on}} 1 September, and levied <b>from</b> <b>individual</b> landowners by decuriones (decurions). These decurions, {{analogous}} to city councilors, were responsible for paying from their own pocket what they failed to collect. Diocletian's reforms also {{increased the number of}} financial officials in the provinces: more rationales and magistri privatae are attested under Diocletian's reign than before. These officials represented the interests of the fisc, which collected taxes in gold, and the Imperial properties. Fluctuations {{in the value of the}} currency made collection of taxes in kind the norm, although these could be converted into coin. Rates shifted to take inflation into account. In 296, Diocletian issued an edict reforming census procedures. This edict introduced a general five-year census for the whole empire, replacing prior censuses that had operated at different speeds throughout the empire. The new censuses would keep up with changes in the values of capita and iuga.|$|E
5|$|Moving <b>from</b> <b>individual</b> graphs to graph families, if {{a family}} of graphs has the {{property}} that every subgraph of a graph in the family {{is also in the}} family, and every graph in the family has at most as many edges as vertices, then the family contains only pseudoforests. For instance, every subgraph of a thrackle (a graph drawn so that every pair of edges has one point of intersection) is also a thrackle, so Conway's conjecture that every thrackle has at most as many edges as vertices can be restated as saying that every thrackle is a pseudoforest. A more precise characterization is that, if the conjecture is true, then the thrackles are exactly the pseudoforests with no four-vertex cycle and at most one odd cycle.|$|E

5|$|The 2/15th Battalion {{returned}} to Australia in mid-March 1944 aboard the Klipfontein. After docking in Brisbane, a 42-day leave period followed before the battalion came together again at Ravenshoe {{to begin the}} process of rebuilding in preparation for the next phase of the war. Between June and August, training progressed <b>from</b> <b>individual</b> instruction up to brigade-level exercises as the unit was re-constituted for its next campaign. During training it experienced a high turnover of personnel and a large influx of reinforcements, including several officers, was received in the middle of 1944 from the disbanded 62nd Battalion, a Queensland-based Militia battalion that had previously been assigned to Merauke Force. A long period of training followed the battalion's return to Australia in early 1944, as there was a degree of uncertainty about the Australian Army's role in future operations in the Pacific after the US military assumed primary responsibility for combat operations in the theatre. Nevertheless, in the final months of the war the 2/15th took part in efforts to recapture North Borneo as part of Operation Oboe Six. After a battalion-level exercise in early 1945, the 2/15th sailed from Australia aboard the Charles Lummis in early May.|$|E

5|$|With {{the end of}} the war, the Swiss {{troops were}} no longer bound along the Rhine and in the Grisons.

The involvement of the Old Swiss Confederacy, acting in its own interests in these wars, was brought to an end by the defeat against French forces in the battle of Marignano in 1515 and a subsequent peace treaty with the French king in 1516, the so-called Eternal Peace. However, Swiss mercenaries <b>from</b> <b>individual</b> cantons of the federation continued to participate in the Italian Wars well beyond (until the middle of the 16th century) in the service of various parties and, following that peace with France, in particular {{in the service of the}} French king.|$|E
40|$|An {{epidemiologic}} {{evaluation of}} patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome from different locations in the People's Republic of China was conducted to define the prevalence of two Hantavirus serotypes, Seoul (SEO) and Hantaan (HTN). Serum specimens were collected between 5 and 14 days after the onset of illness and were tested for antibodies by both hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and plaque reduction neutralization (PRN). By the HI test, the geometric mean titer (GMT) of antibodies to SEO in the sera <b>from</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>from</b> Kaifeng City of Henan Province was five times higher than that to HTN. In contrast, by the HI test, the sera <b>from</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>from</b> Jiande County of Zhejiang Province had a GMT of antibodies to HTN that was seven times higher than that to SEO. In the sera <b>from</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>from</b> Shanghai, only a twofold difference was observed in HI antibody titers to the two hemagglutinins by the HI test, with that to HTN being higher than that to SEO. By the PRN test, the GMT ratios of antibody between HTN and SEO strains <b>from</b> <b>individuals</b> in Kaifeng, Jiande, and Shanghai {{were found to be}} 1 : 13, 14 : 1, and 2 : 1 respectively. A close correlation (r = 0. 8219) and concordance rate (78. 3 %) were observed between the PRN and HI tests for the identification of the serotypes of individual cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. The hantavirus serotypes <b>from</b> <b>individuals</b> in Kaifeng and Jiande were identified as predominantly SEO and HTN, respectively, and those <b>from</b> <b>individuals</b> in Shanghai had an indeterminant serotype defined by these two techniques.

A molecular marker that could identify patients susceptible to metachronous cancers would be of clinical importance.
