40|$|Author to whom {{correspondence}} {{should be}} addressed The phenomenon of drug-facilitated crimes (sexual assaults, robbery) is common in many countries. Because of wide variety of substances used as <b>date-rape</b> <b>drugs,</b> their low concentration in blood and the long delay between the alleged crime and clinical examination, analysis of biological fluids collected from victims of rapes for presence of these drugs was rare up to now. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop and apply a LC-APCI-MS screening procedure for <b>date-rape</b> <b>drugs</b> in blood. Target analytes were isolated using liquid-liquid extraction. Analyses were carried out using an Agilent LC/MS operating in APCI mode. Detection of all compounds was based on pseudomolecular ions that were monitored in 6 groups up to 19 ions in each group. Accuracy of the method was verified in the Qualitative Screening Analysis Program of the International Proficiency Testing Scheme with clonidine assigned concentration of 50 ng/mL. The procedure can be easily expanded for more substances. The LC-APCI-MS procedure was successfully applied to the analysis of authentic blood samples collected from victims of rapes in routine casework...|$|R

50|$|The GC-EI-MS is {{also used}} in {{forensic}} science. One example is the analysis of five local anesthetics in blood using headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-electron impact ionization selected ion monitoring (GC-MS-EI-SIM). Local anesthesia is widely used but sometimes these drugs can cause medical accidents. In such cases an accurate, simple, and rapid method {{for the analysis of}} local anesthetics is required. GC-EI-MS was used in one case with an analysis time of 65 minutes and a sample size of approximately 0.2 g, a relatively small amount. Another application in forensic practice is the determination of <b>date-rape</b> <b>drugs</b> (DRDs) in urine. These drugs are used to incapacitate victims and then rape or rob them. The analyses of these drugs are difficult due to the low concentrations in the body fluids and often a long time delay between the event and clinical examination. However, using GC-EI-MS allows a simple, sensitive and robust method for the identification, detection and quantification of 128 compounds of DRDs in urine.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{antidepressant}} {{drugs like}} selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) represent {{the first choice}} {{in the treatment of}} moderate to severe depressive illness, various phobias, and personality disorders. In spite of the therapeutic aspects, they often produce very severe and toxic effects in deliberate and accidental cases of poisoning. These are also considered as <b>date-rape</b> <b>drugs</b> used for drugged victims for raping or robbing. Therefore, in recent years, their analyses in different biological matrices for clinical and toxicological analysis purposes has been a target worthy of interest. Thus, the review focuses on recent advancements of various separation techniques like chromatography and electrophoresis that are concernd with the determination of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor drugs and their metabolites in various biological matrices. In addition to this, a critical discussion on analytical approaches has also been incorporated, suggesting their applicability and limitations for further implementations. Thus, this paper will definitely help in the selection and development of proper analytical methodologies to achieve satisfactory results, better scientific understanding, and test interpretation...|$|R

40|$|Drugs used {{in sexual}} assault, {{which are also}} called as date rape drugs, are common {{phenomenon}} of crime in many countries. In a typical scenario, a perpetrator adds a <b>date-rape</b> <b>drug</b> which has sedative effect into alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverage of an unsuspecting person. After drug administration, mostly amnesia and symptoms such as confussion, loss of memory, lack of muscle control, dizziness occur. The main drugs in sexual assaults are benzodiazepines such as &# 947;-hydroxy butyrate and its analogs, clonazepam, alprazolam, flunitrazepam, oxazepam, ketamine, barbiturates, antidepressants, cocaine and stimulants. Most of these drugs are colorless, odorless and highly soluble in alcohol or other beverages quickly. They are rapidly absorbed and eliminated after oral administration. A victim may complain to police or other legal forces after several days due to emotional trauma as shame, fear, doubt and disbelief. For this reason, It {{is important to know}} what time the sample is taken from the victim to confirm the presence of the drug. In this study, we will present a general approach to date-rape drugs used in sexual assault. [Archives Medical Review Journal 2013; 22 (3. 000) : 418 - 425...|$|E

Following closely behind levels in Western countries, the number of drug-facilitated sexual assaults (DFSAs), involving the illicit use of medicine, has been recently increasing in Japan. Tirazolam is the most frequently used <b>date-rape</b> <b>drug</b> in DFSAs occurring in Japan. In this study, the effect of triazolam on behavior in response to fear and anxiety was evaluated using an elevated plus-maze test in mice. Triazolam-treated animals (0. 01 mg/kg) showed no significant difference in total locomotor activity compared with vehicle-treated mice (controls). On the contrary, activity levels on the open arms of the apparatus (time spent, mean value of movement), where mice would normally feel anxiety or fear, were significantly increased in triazolam-treated mice compared with controls. However, total locomotor activities on the plus-maze were not different between two groups, indicating that sedation was not induced by tirazolam under these conditions. These results suggest that triazolam treatment led the mice to become insensitive to fear and anxiety; their defence reactions were impaired. We conclude that this finding provides scientific evidence in reply to defence arguments presented in court trials that there is little or no evidence of the victim attempting to escape from a sexual assault. Additionally, the finding is as true of other benzodiazepine receptor agonists as of triazolam...|$|E
40|$|Epidemiology: Date-rape drugs cause {{sedation}} and amnesia to {{the extent}} that their victims cannot resist or may not be aware of a sexual assault. About 25 % of the 1400 women who contact the Canadian Sexual Assault Centre each year report that drugs were a factor in a rape. 1 Drug-facilitated rape is most commonly linked to the surreptitious administration of flunitrazepam (Ro-hypnol) or of a newer arrival, gamma hydroxybutyrate acid (GHB). Reports from the police and emergency depart-ments suggest that use of these drugs, particularly GHB, in sexual assaults is increasing. 2 Routine tests to detect the drugs are not widely available, prompt-ing one Ontario Liberal MPP to push the province to provide immediate test-ing for women who suspect they have been victims of date rape. Well intentioned though that initia-tive may be, widespread testing is al-ready available for the drugs most com-monly used in date rape: alcohol, marijuana, benzodiazepines, cocaine, heroin and amphetamines. Any sub-stance that is administered to lower sex-ual inhibition and enhance the possibil-ity of unwanted sexual intercourse is potentially a <b>date-rape</b> <b>drug.</b> Of 2003 urine samples submitted by rape treat-ment centres across the United States within 72 hours of a suspected drug-facilitated rape, GHB was detected in only 3 % of the samples and fluni-trazepam in less than 1 %; alcohol was detected in 69 % of the samples, mari-juana in 18 % and cocaine in 5 %. 3 Physicians {{should be aware of the}} mechanisms and clinical management of flunitrazepam and GHB intoxication, but they should also be aware that, when a drug-facilitated rape is suspect-ed, alcohol is the substance most likely involved...|$|E
40|$|Sedative {{agents are}} used to {{facilitate}} sexual assault due {{to their ability to}} render the victim passive, submissive and unable to resist. The primary pharmacological effect of the benzodiazepine tetrazepam is muscle relaxation, whereas the benzodiazepine diazepam acts on the central nervous system (CNS) exerting mainly sedation effects. Therefore, contrary to tetrazepam, diazepam is an often-abused drug, which can potentially be used as a <b>date-rape</b> <b>drug.</b> In this study, we describe the detection of low amounts of diazepam in Myolastan® (Sanofi-Synthelabo S. A. Brussels, Belgium) and Epsipam® (Will-Pharma, Wavre, Belgium) 50 mg tablet preparations by LC-MS-MS, GC-FID and HPLC-DAD. Considering the important forensic implication of this finding, a study was conducted with volunteers receiving a single or repeated dosage of Myolastan®. Urine, hair and preserved oral fluid samples were analysed using a previously described sensitive and specific LC-MS-MS detection method allowing for the simultaneous quantification of tetrazepam, diazepam, nordiazepam, oxazepam and temazepam. This study demonstrates that diazepam can be observed in urine samples even after a single dose of Myolastan®. In addition, maintaining therapy for 1 week results in the detection of both diazepam and nordiazepam in urine samples and of diazepam in the first hair segment. Importantly, comparing urine and hair samples after a single intake of diazepam versus the single and 1 week administration of Myolastan® shows that the possible metabolic conversion of tetrazepam to diazepam is a more plausible explanation for the detection of diazepam in biological samples after the intake of Myolastan®. As such, these results reveal that the presence of diazepam and/or nordiazepam in biological samples from alleged drug-facilitated assault cases should be interpreted with care. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, or GHB, is a {{substance}} naturally present within mammal species. Properties of neurotransmitter or neuromodulator are generally given to this substance. GHB is therapeutically {{used as an}} anesthetic, but {{can be used for}} criminal offenses (<b>date-rape</b> <b>drug).</b> It appears that the window of detection of GHB is very short in both blood and urine, and therefore its presence is very difficult to prove after a rape case. In order to document single exposure, we investigated the use of hair. Hair was collected one month after the allegated event in order to sample the corresponding period after regular growing. After rapid (2 min) decontamination with dichloromethane, the hair shaft was cut into 3 -mm segments. They were overnight incubated in 0. 01 N NaOH in the presence of GHB-d 6, followed by neutralization and extraction in ethyl acetate under acidic conditions. GHB (precursor ion m/z 233, product ions m/z 147 and 148) was tested by GC/MS/MS (Finnigan TSQ 700) after derivatization with BSTFA � 1 % TMCS. Physiological concentrations (n � 24) were in the range 0. 5 to 12. 0 ng/mg, with no influence due to hair color. No variation of concentrations was observed along the hair shaft in controlled subjects, except for the proximal segment, due to an incorporation through sweat. This demonstrates that endogenous levels for each single subject are constant during hair growth. A controlled human administration of 25 mg/kg to a volunteer demonstrated that a single exposure to GHB is detectable in hair after segmentation. In a case of rape under influence, a clear increase of the corresponding segment (about 2. 4 ng/mg) in time was observed, in comparison with the other segments (0. 6 to 0. 8 ng/mg). This study demonstrates that a single exposure to GHB in a case of sexual assault can be documented by hair analysis when collected about one month after the crime...|$|E
