40|$|The {{need for}} {{intelligent}} shopping agents has grown {{as a result}} of the vast amount of information available to internet consumers. However, most of the currently available intelligent shopping agents only request consumers to define the criteria of the product in terms of price range and product features required. In order to satisfy internet consumers' needs, intelligent agents should also consider more aspects. Usually, before internet consumers make buying decisions, they may consider several psychological factors such as whether they like: famous brand name products; new style products; high-quality products, same products; lower-price products, etc. They may not only consider product features but also different businesses have different e-marketing mix elements, namely Product, Price, Promotion, Place, Personalization, Privacy, Customer Service, Community, Site, Security and Sales Promotion, which target different customers' preferences. In this research, four new streams are integrated: 1) Discovery of new psychological factors in the E-Commerce environment, 2) The relationship between psychological factors and e-marketing mix elements, 3) Creation of an ontology to codify the relationship between psychological factors and e-marketing mix elements and then 4) Development of an <b>intelligent</b> <b>shopping</b> <b>agent</b> based on the ontology. The <b>intelligent</b> <b>shopping</b> <b>agent</b> can provide services to both businesses and consumers such that businesses can acquire their target customers and at the same time customers can get their ideal business web sites to buy their desired products by mapping the psychological factors of internet consumers with businesses' e-marketing mix elements. In this way both parties benefit. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|<b>Shopping</b> <b>Agents,</b> which {{search the}} Internet {{for the most}} {{favourable}} offer, collect information and are even capable of purchasing a product independently without human interference will {{play an important role}} in future E-Commerce. There are however a lot of legal issues related to the use of <b>Shopping</b> <b>Agents</b> such as how to legally classify <b>Shopping</b> <b>Agents</b> or if contracts concluded by <b>Shopping</b> <b>Agents</b> are binding upon its principal. Further it is questionable if the principal is liable for the conduct of the Agent. The evaluation of these legal issues will be completed by a description of the characteristics of such Agents. 1 What are <b>Shopping</b> <b>Agents?</b> At present online shopping is still an arduous venture. In order to acquire a product suppliers have to be found and a comparison between those, as well as the individual products has to be executed by hand. Due to the large number of suppliers it is almost impossible to get an overview over the different offers. Thus a selection of the optimal product is hardly possible. Since these steps of searching, evaluating and purchasing a product always recur it is advisable to automate and transfer them upon an <b>Shopping</b> <b>Agent.</b> The sought article is described to the <b>Shopping</b> <b>Agent,</b> which searches the Internet for the most favourable offer, collects information and is even capable of purchasing that product independently without human interference...|$|R
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{expansion}} of the Internet, the implementation of agent technology in electronic commerce (e-commerce) becomes very popular, which provides a promising field for the approach of agent and Artificial Intelligence technology. In this paper, we describe a multi-agent <b>intelligent</b> <b>shopping</b> assistant implemented in our EasyMall system, and present the agent-based model for <b>intelligent</b> <b>shopping</b> assistant. The user interacts with the agent by means of a text dialog, and the input texts are translated into agent communication language through XML. Thus it solves the problem of understanding natural language for agent in the virtual environments...|$|R
40|$|Mobile {{agents are}} an {{attractive}} paradigm for implementing communication intensive {{applications such as}} distributed databases, network management and more recently e-commerce. Like all other software systems, reliability {{is a major concern}} in mobile agent systems. The problem is complicated for mobile agent systems as the remote sites on which the mobile agent executes cannot be controlled by the application programmer. In this paper, we use MAgNET, a mobile agent enabled ecommerce system to study and propose solutions for the reliability of mobile agent systems. In MAgNET, human buyers create and deploy mobile <b>shopping</b> <b>agents</b> that visit dierent seller sites on the Internet to comparison shop for a particular item. MAgNET employs passive replication of the mobile <b>shopping</b> <b>agents</b> to protect against faults on the remote seller sites. Process faults are addressed by cloning the <b>shopping</b> <b>agent</b> on each seller site prior to execution. To address network and node faults, we have used the bounded failure rate hypothesis along with passive replication of the <b>shopping</b> <b>agent</b> at each seller site...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of a <b>shop</b> <b>agent</b> negotiating bilaterally with many customers about a bundle of goods or services together with a price. To facilitate the <b>shop</b> <b>agent’s</b> search for mutually beneficial alternative bundles, we develop a method for online learning customers’ preferences, while respecting their privacy. By introducing additional parameters, we represent customers’ highly nonlinear preferences as a linear model. We develop a method for learning the underlying stochastic process of these parameters online. As the conducted computer experiments show, the developed method {{has a number of}} advantages: it scales well, the acquired knowledge is robust towards changes in the shop’s pricing strategy, and it performs well even if customers behave strategically...|$|R
40|$|Shopping online {{is still}} a {{confusing}} activity due to many vendors, inconsistent information, and di#erent vendor site organization. <b>Shopping</b> <b>agents</b> based on user-centered business models have been unsuccessful in the past because shoppers have not perceived price comparison as a service worth paying for. As a result shopping bots today are biased in favor of vendors who pay fees to be listed. To make user-centered business models viable, <b>shopping</b> <b>agents</b> must become more useful. To this end we describe a shopping assistant capable of learning the heterogeneous and dynamic preferences of shoppers by observing their behavior unobtrusively, and of presenting shoppers with adaptively customized information about new items discovered by autonomously monitoring vendor sites...|$|R
50|$|The first widely {{recognized}} comparison-shopping agent was BargainFinder, developed by Andersen Consulting (now Accenture). The team, led by researcher Bruce Krulwich, created BargainFinder in 1995 {{as an experiment}} and published it on-line without advance warning to the e-commerce sites being compared. The first commercial <b>shopping</b> <b>agent,</b> called Jango, was produced by Netbot, a Seattle startup company founded by University of Washington professors Oren Etzioni and Daniel S. Weld; Netbot was acquired by the Excite portal in late 1997. Junglee, a Bay-area startup, also pioneered comparison shopping technology and was soon acquired by Amazon.com. Other early comparison <b>shopping</b> <b>agents</b> included pricewatch.com and killerapp.com.

30|$|The main {{result of}} the paper is a novel {{framework}} to formally model <b>intelligent</b> <b>shopping</b> malls. The result is twofold. It proposes, on one side, a class of application scenarios for cellular automata {{in the context of}} ambient intelligence, related to blended shopping. The use of such a formal computation model is a certificate of soundness of the whole framework. On the other side, we provide a protocol to handle privacy in the <b>intelligent</b> <b>shopping</b> ambient with respect to shoppers’ information included in their shopping lists. Furthermore, we propose the Offering Finding algorithm for guiding shoppers, within a shopping mall, to reach and pick up offerings for desired products in their shopping lists. A software simulation implementing the above mentioned algorithm has been also developed and described together with an early experimentation case. Future works will provide solutions to guarantee privacy also for merchants, whose instrumented shops exchange messages, providing sensitive offering information, which can be used for unfair competition within the mall. Moreover we plan also to develop an automatic correctness verification, with model checking techniques, of all the presented framework as in [9, 10, 24].|$|R
40|$|Software agents help {{automate}} {{a variety}} of tasks including those involved in buying and selling products over the Internet. Although <b>shopping</b> <b>agents</b> provide convenience for consumers and yield more efficient markets, today's first-generation <b>shopping</b> <b>agents</b> are limited to comparing merchant offerings only on price instead of their full range of value. As such, they do a disservice to both consumers and retailers by hiding important merchant value-added services from consumer consideration. Likewise, the increasingly popular online auctions pit sellers against buyers in distributive negotiation tug-of-wars over price. This paper analyzes these approaches from economic, behavioral, and software agent perspectives then proposes integrative negotiation as a more suitable approach to retail electronic commerce. Finally, we identify promising techniques (e. g., multi-attribute utility theory, distributed constraint satisfaction, and conjoint analysis) for implementing agent-mediated integrative negotiation. 1...|$|R

40|$|Comparison {{shopping}} is a merchant brokering process {{that provides the}} information about a specific product from several distributed shopping mall sites. The implementation of a comparison <b>shopping</b> <b>agent</b> is a challenging issue mainly because different on-line shopping malls employ their own way of organizing interface components, processing user queries, and displaying search results on the browser. In most of the previous comparsion shoppers, a human designer manually builds the wrapper for each shopping mall that contains rules for extracting product information. This approach is not scalable since the designer must build a wrapper by hand for each new shopping mall. Scalable comparison shoppers such as ShopBot have been suggested that automatically build the wrapper through learning, but since these systems assume some regularities and strong biases, many real-world shopping malls are unable to be recognized.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} <b>shopping</b> <b>agent</b> with a robust {{inductive}} learning method that automatically constructs wrappers for semistructured online stores. Strong biases assumed in many existing systems are weakened {{so that the}} real stores with reasonably complex document structures can be handled. Our method treats a logical line as a basic unit, and recognizes the position {{and the structure of}} product descriptions by finding the most frequent pattern from the sequence of logical line information in output HTML pages.

40|$|Internet <b>Shopping</b> <b>Agents</b> (ISAs) allow {{consumers}} to costlessly search many online retailers and buy {{at the lowest}} price. One would expect these ISAs to subject sellers to intense price competition that results in uniform low prices. Yet, Internet retailers have joined these ISAs. Furthermore, the prices charged by inside retailers can vary substantially. We {{examine the impact of}} ISAs on market competition. An ISA creates differentiation in the pricing strategies of ex-ante identical retailers: Some retailers join the ISA due to mass of consumers that they can potentially win, while others stay out and extract surplus from their loyal consumers, while others stay our and extract surplus from their loyal consumers. The equilibrium inside pricing is such that the average price charged can increase or decrease when more retailers join, depending on whether or not the reach of the ISA is independent of the number of joining retailers. When the reach is endogenous, there exist a unique number of inside retailers. consumer search, comparison <b>shopping,</b> <b>shopping</b> <b>agents,</b> internet intermediaries, internet retailing, game theory, electronic commerce...|$|R
