50|$|Structures, {{which are}} {{designed}} as integral arches, {{can be constructed}} as stiff individual objects or {{by means of a}} sprayed concrete procedure. Arches made of sprayed concrete provide for free and organic shapes, allowing rooms to become suffused with light. The sprayed concrete procedure was first used by natural scientist Carl Akeley in 1911. Akeley patented a device able to spray fine-grained concrete. While sprayed concrete is mainly applied in underground engineering and tunnel construction, Friedrich Kiesler was the first to use this technique for the construction of buildings. Swiss architect Peter Vetsch improved the technique over several years. To date, he has built over 40 earth houses using sprayed concrete, and he can therefore be considered the leading authority in this area of expertise. The sprayed concrete is applied to a finely meshed metal stretch net which is welded onto the supporting armature. The curvatures are bent and formed according to the intended shape of the building. A 20 cm thick polyurethane solid-foam-insulation is sprayed onto the outside of the arches, protecting the house from low or high temperatures. A fleece filter mat is then laid on top of this and the building is covered with a thick layer of soil some 80 cm to 3 metres thick. The foundation of the buildings designed by Peter Vetsch are built conventionally. The interior walls of an earth house are furnished using loam rendering which provides superior <b>humidity</b> <b>compensation.</b> The loam rendering is finally coated with lime-white cement paint.|$|E
40|$|We used SnO 2 gas sensors for {{monitoring}} ethylene {{in the range}} of interest for fruit ripening. The effect of atmospheric humidity on the sensor conductance and response towards ethylene was quantitatively measured. An algorithm for <b>humidity</b> <b>compensation</b> of the sensor’s response was developed and applied to experimental data. The results of our analysis proved useful for the application of chemoresistive sensors for agro-alimentary monitoring...|$|E
40|$|The {{conductance}} in air of thick-film gas sensors operating via flow trough tecnique strongly {{depends on}} the flux. In this work we demonstrate that the major effect of the flow rate {{is a change in}} humidity, because the thermal effect on the sensor is negligible. A mathematical model based on heat exchange and direct measurements of the resistance of the heater confirms this hypothesis and <b>humidity</b> <b>compensation</b> gave very good results...|$|E
40|$|We report {{results of}} {{frequency}} stability measurements {{of an extended}} cavity diode laser (ECDL) whose frequency is stabilized by a non-evacuated scanning transfer cavity. The transfer cavity is locked to a commercial frequency stabilized helium–neon laser. Frequency stability is measured by use of an optical frequency comb. The environmental perturbations (variations of temperature, air pressure, and humidity) are also simultaneously measured. The observed frequency drift of the ECDL is well explained by environmental perturbations. An atmospheric pressure variation, which is difficult to control with a non-evacuated cavity, is mainly affected to the frequency stability. Thus we put the cavity into a simple O-ring sealed (non-evacuated) tube. With this simple O-ring sealed tube, the frequency drift is reduced {{by a factor of}} 3, and the Allan variance reaches a value of 2. 4 × 10 − 10, corresponds to the frequency stability of 83 kHz, at the average time of 3000 s. Since the actual frequency drift is well estimated by simultaneous measurement of the ambient temperature, pressure, and <b>humidity,</b> a feed-forward <b>compensation</b> of frequency drifts is also feasible in order to achieve a higher frequency stability with a simple non-evacuated transfer cavity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMicrobial contamination, either {{before or}} during food {{production}} phases, {{is one of}} the major concerns of food manufacturers. In this work we present the EOS 507 C Electronic Nose (EN) for early screening of Enterobacter hormaechei type strain (ATCC 49162) contamination in vegetable soup. The EOS 507 C, based on an array of metal oxide semiconductor (MOX) sensors, is a rather innovative system equipped with dynamic headspace autosampler and new functionalities such as real-time sample <b>humidity</b> <b>compensation,</b> sensor response linearization and automated periodic calibration. The EOS 507 C has provided excellent results in terms of screening capabilities: E. hormaechei contamination was detected in 24 hours...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} work (Marek et al., 2013) a time-monitoring oxygen sensor was proposed. This sensor {{is based on}} a diffusion-controlled oxygen reaction of the indicator system methylene blue (MB) /leuco methylene blue (LMB) and riboflavin embedded in a water-loaded poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) matrix. It can be used in packaging, sensors, and biotechnology applications. Since the oxygen diffusion coefficient in the PVA matrix strongly depends on temperature and humidity, two different approaches were developed within this work to compensate for these two effects. To compensate for faster oxygen diffusion at higher temperatures, iron particles were added to the PVA matrix, resulting in a novel PVA/iron composite matrix. Adding silicone particles allows compensating the influence of humidity. Both temperature and <b>humidity</b> <b>compensation</b> were modeled using the finite-element method in good accordance with the experimental data. This allows tuning the sensor for application at different conditions of temperature and humidity and therewith in different environments...|$|E
