Twenty-nine nations participated, but not Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary, or Turkey, none {{of which}} were invited because of their roles in the war. Several newly created <b>European</b> <b>states,</b> such as Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, made their Olympic debut.|$|E

The war with the Crusaders did not prevent Muslims under Ayyubid governance from developing good commercial relations with <b>European</b> <b>states.</b> This led to fruitful interaction between both sides in different fields of economic activity, particularly in agriculture and trade.|$|E
5|$|Mao bitterly opposed Khrushchev's {{attempts}} {{to reach a}} rapprochement with more liberal Eastern <b>European</b> <b>states</b> such as Yugoslavia. Khrushchev's government, on the other hand, was reluctant to endorse Mao's desires for an assertive worldwide revolutionary movement, preferring to conquer capitalism through raising {{the standard of living}} in communist-bloc countries.|$|E

5|$|The Stalinist {{occupation}} of Eastern Europe {{was the issue}} of prime concern, and it raised many problems of interpretation. At first, the International held that, while the USSR was a degenerated workers' state, the post-World War II East <b>European</b> <b>states</b> were still bourgeois entities, because revolution from above was not possible, and capitalism persisted.|$|E

5|$|By 1700, the <b>European</b> <b>states</b> {{had enough}} troops and ships at their disposal, {{following}} {{the end of}} a number of wars, to begin better protecting their important colonies in the West Indies and in the Americas, without relying on the aid of privateers. Pirates based in the Caribbean were chased from the seas by a new British squadron based at Port Royal, Jamaica, and a smaller group of Spanish privateers, sailing from the Spanish Main, known as the Guarda de Costa, or simply the Guarda.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} <b>European</b> <b>state</b> aid control in the new Member states. Two main arguments are derived from comparisons of state aid policies over time and across countries: First, changes in CEECs’ state aid policies can mainly be traced backed to the (anticipated) impact of post-accession state aid control by the European Commission rather than to accession conditionality. Second, despite strong tendencies of policy convergence we observe persistently different national strategies in dealing with <b>European</b> <b>state</b> aid control. More generally, studying the domestic impact of <b>European</b> <b>state</b> aid control provides us with a telling example of the peculiarities of complying with rules of negative integration...|$|R

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, {{one of the largest and}} most populous <b>European</b> <b>states,</b> was little more than a pawn of its neighbors (the Russian Empire, Prussia and Austria), who interfered in its domestic politics almost at will. In the second half of the 18th century, the Commonwealth was repeatedly partitioned by the neighboring powers and ceased to exist.|$|E
5|$|Despite strong pacifist {{sentiment}} after World War I, {{its aftermath}} still caused irredentist and revanchist nationalism in several <b>European</b> <b>states.</b> These sentiments were especially marked in Germany {{because of the}} significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses incurred by the Treaty of Versailles. Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 per cent of its home territory {{and all of its}} overseas possessions, while German annexation of other states was prohibited, reparations were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country's armed forces.|$|E
5|$|Following the U.S. {{financial}} crisis in 2008, {{fears of a}} sovereign debt crisis developed in 2009 among investors concerning some <b>European</b> <b>states,</b> with the situation becoming particularly tense in early 2010. Greece was most acutely affected, but fellow Eurozone members Cyprus, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain were also significantly affected. To {{be included in the}} eurozone, countries had to fulfil certain convergence criteria, but the meaningfulness of such criteria was diminished by the fact it was not enforced with the same level of strictness among countries.|$|E

5|$|Joshua Humphreys' {{design was}} long on keel and narrow of beam (width) {{to allow for}} the {{mounting}} of very heavy guns. The design incorporated a diagonal scantling (rib) scheme to limit hogging (warping) and included extremely heavy planking. This gave the hull greater strength than those of more lightly built frigates. Since the fledgling United States could not match the numbers of ships of the <b>European</b> <b>states,</b> Humphreys designed his frigates to be able to overpower other frigates, but with the speed to escape from a ship of the line.|$|E
5|$|On 20 April 1792, the French National Convention {{declared}} war on Austria. In this War of the First Coalition (1792–1798), France ranged itself against most of the <b>European</b> <b>states</b> sharing land or water borders with her, plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire. Although the Coalition forces achieved several victories at Verdun, Kaiserslautern, Neerwinden, Mainz, Amberg and Würzburg, the efforts of Napoleon Bonaparte in northern Italy pushed Austrian forces back and resulted in the negotiation of the Peace of Leoben (17 April 1797) and the subsequent Treaty of Campo Formio (October 1797).|$|E

5|$|The Third World Congress in 1951 {{resolved}} {{that the}} economies of the East <b>European</b> <b>states</b> and their political regimes had come to resemble that of the USSR more and more. These states were then described as deformed workers states in an analogy with the degenerated workers state in Russia. The term deformed was used rather than degenerated, because no workers' revolution had led to the foundation of these states.|$|E
5|$|Whether or not {{the summit}} is {{considered}} important for its content, the meeting held some symbolic importance. First of all, {{it was the first}} NATO summit between the leaders of the North-American and Western <b>European</b> <b>states,</b> and Eastern <b>European</b> <b>states,</b> states that were finally, after decades of Cold War tensions, together in the same alliance. The media attention that these new members received during the summit, opened public debates about whether there was still a consensus about the purpose, the perceived threats and the future borders of NATO among its 26 members. That this was not the case, became clear {{in the run-up to the}} 2006 Riga Summit. Secondly, the holding of the summit in Istanbul made it the most eastern summit in NATO's history. It marked the increasingly key role played by Turkey as a major strategic hub due to its location close to the hotbeds of tension and conflict in the South Caucasus and the Middle East. The location of the summit made clear that NATO’s security concerns had shifted towards the southeastern part of the European continent. By shifting eastwards, the Alliance’s centre of gravity ventured into very different areas from those on which the Cold War military NATO had focused.|$|E
5|$|While {{the spread}} of Christianity in Poland took centuries to finish, the process was {{ultimately}} successful, as within several decades Poland joined the rank of established <b>European</b> <b>states</b> recognised by the papacy and the Holy Roman Empire.

5|$|In all, the Renaissance {{could be}} viewed as an attempt by intellectuals to study and improve the secular and worldly, both through the revival of ideas from antiquity, and through novel {{approaches}} to thought. Some scholars, such as Rodney Stark, play down the Renaissance in favor of the earlier innovations of the Italian city-states in the High Middle Ages, which married responsive government, Christianity and the birth of capitalism. This analysis argues that, whereas the great <b>European</b> <b>states</b> (France and Spain) were absolutist monarchies, and others were under direct Church control, the independent city republics of Italy took over the principles of capitalism invented on monastic estates and set off a vast unprecedented commercial revolution that preceded and financed the Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|In {{consolidating}} his power, Muhammad Ali, {{the rebel}} governor of Ottoman Egypt, was modeling his {{rule on the}} bureaucratic organization characteristic of modern <b>European</b> <b>states.</b> Like earlier rulers of Egypt, Muhammad Ali desired to exercise control over greater Syria (Bilad al-Sham), both for its strategic value and for its natural resources. In addition to its abundant natural resources, Syria also had a prospering international trading community with well-developed markets. In addition, in Ali's strategy, Syria {{would serve as a}} captive market for goods being produced in Egypt. Moreover, the extension of Egyptian control over Syria was sought because it would serve as a buffer state between Egypt and the Ottoman sultan in Constantinople. Ali was attempting to become independent of the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|It was {{followed}} by almost four decades of international peace in Europe. No further major conflict occurred until the Crimean War. Changes to the configuration of <b>European</b> <b>states,</b> as refashioned after Waterloo, included {{the formation of the}} Holy Alliance of reactionary governments intent on repressing revolutionary and democratic ideas, and the reshaping of the former Holy Roman Empire into a German Confederation increasingly marked by the political dominance of Prussia. The bicentenary of Waterloo has prompted renewed attention to the geopolitical and economic legacy of the battle and the century of relative transatlantic peace which followed.|$|E
