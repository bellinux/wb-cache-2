5|$|The third {{source of}} over-provisioning comes from known <b>free</b> <b>space</b> on the drive, gaining {{endurance}} and {{performance at the}} expense of reporting unused portions, and/or {{at the expense of}} current or future capacity. This <b>free</b> <b>space</b> can be identified by the operating system using the TRIM command. Alternately, some SSDs provide a utility that permit the end user to select additional over-provisioning. Furthermore, if any SSD is set up with an overall partitioning layout smaller than 100% of the available space, that unpartitioned space will be automatically used by the SSD as over-provisioning as well. Yet another source of over-provisioning is operating system minimum <b>free</b> <b>space</b> limits; some operating systems maintain a certain minimum <b>free</b> <b>space</b> per drive, particularly on the boot or main drive. If this additional space can be identified by the SSD, perhaps through continuous usage of the TRIM command, then this acts as semi-permanent over-provisioning. Over-provisioning often takes away from user capacity, either temporarily or permanently, but it gives back reduced write amplification, increased endurance, and increased performance.|$|E
5|$|The actual {{benefit of}} the TRIM command depends upon the free user space on the SSD. If the user {{capacity}} on the SSD was 100GB and the user actually saved 95GB of data to the drive, any TRIM operation would not add more than 5GB of <b>free</b> <b>space</b> for garbage collection and wear leveling. In those situations, {{increasing the amount of}} over-provisioning by 5GB would allow the SSD to have more consistent performance because it would always have the additional 5GB of additional <b>free</b> <b>space</b> without having to wait for the TRIM command to come from the OS.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} this type of {{decomposition}} into interdigitating trees can be seen in some simple types of mazes, with a single entrance and no disconnected components of its walls. In this case both the maze walls and the space between the walls {{take the form of a}} mathematical tree. If the <b>free</b> <b>space</b> of the maze is partitioned into simple cells (such as the squares of a grid) then this system of cells can be viewed as an embedding of a planar graph, in which the tree structure of the walls forms a spanning tree of the graph and the tree structure of the <b>free</b> <b>space</b> forms a spanning tree of the dual graph. Similar pairs of interdigitating trees can also be seen in the tree-shaped pattern of streams and rivers within a drainage basin and the dual tree-shaped pattern of ridgelines separating the streams.|$|E

5|$|Atoms lack a {{well-defined}} outer boundary, so their dimensions are usually {{described in terms}} of an atomic radius. This {{is a measure of the}} distance out to which the electron cloud extends from the nucleus. However, this assumes the atom to exhibit a spherical shape, which is only obeyed for atoms in vacuum or <b>free</b> <b>space.</b> Atomic radii may be derived from the distances between two nuclei when the two atoms are joined in a chemical bond. The radius varies with the location of an atom on the atomic chart, the type of chemical bond, the number of neighboring atoms (coordination number) and a quantum mechanical property known as spin. On the periodic table of the elements, atom size tends to increase when moving down columns, but decrease when moving across rows (left to right). Consequently, the smallest atom is helium with a radius of 32pm, while one of the largest is caesium at 225pm.|$|E

In order to study the effect of such ionic motions on energy loss, the interaction between ionic motion and inhomogeneous structure on the electrical properties was investigated. For this objective, the permittivity and the electric modulus were observed for isotactic poly(propylene) (iPP) and plasticized poly(vinyl chloride) with dioctyl phthalate (p-PVC) {{by means of the}} Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy. A simple DC conduction is observed for p-PVC. However, for the iPP, another ionic motion appears on lower frequency side in addition to the DC conduction at high temperature. This change of ionic motion is considered to be caused by a phase transition in crystalline phase accompanied by a structural change in the non-crystalline part...|$|R

5|$|Contrary to {{the flat}} {{appearance}} of the loudspeaker, all three panels are slightly curved along the vertical axis to improve quality. The panels themselves are flat, but obtain their curvature by being slightly bent to a curved backing. With the bipolar nature of the speaker emitting sound from both front and back surfaces as it does, {{the application of a}} felt sheet {{to the rear of the}} panels damps and absorbs high frequencies radiating from the back. A crossover network, set at 500Hz, remains necessary to adjust for back-to-front interference causing loss in output at low frequencies. In addition, the speaker should stand in <b>free</b> <b>space</b> to achieve optimum sound. The instructions book contains advice against placement of the speaker in corners or positions close to or parallel with walls, and further explains that a corner placement will adversely affect bass response and be detrimental to the midrange because of standing waves generated.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{conversion}} of London to Christianity in the early 7thcentury, the city's dead had been buried {{in and around the}} local churches. With a limited amount of space for burials, the oldest graves were regularly exhumed to <b>free</b> <b>space</b> for new burials, and the remains of the previous occupants transferred to charnel houses for storage. From the 14th century onwards the charnel houses themselves were overwhelmed, and exhumed bones were scattered where they had been dug up or reburied in pits. Despite this practice, by the mid 17thcentury the city was running seriously short of burial space. A proposal by Christopher Wren to use the reconstruction following the 1666 Great Fire of London as an opportunity to cease burials in the churchyards and establish new cemeteries outside the city was approved by the King and Parliament but vetoed by the Corporation of London, and burials continued at the newly rebuilt churches.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the TRIM command resolves this problem for operating systems that support it like Windows 7, Mac OS (latest releases of Snow Leopard, Lion, and Mountain Lion, patched in some cases), FreeBSD since version 8.1, and Linux since version 2.6.33 of the Linux kernel mainline. When a file is permanently deleted or the drive is formatted, the OS sends the TRIM command along with the LBAs that no longer contain valid data. This informs the SSD that the LBAs in use can be erased and reused. This reduces the LBAs needing to be moved during garbage collection. The result is the SSD will have more <b>free</b> <b>space</b> enabling lower write amplification and higher performance.|$|E
5|$|The phase {{behavior}} of lipid bilayers is determined {{largely by the}} strength of the attractive Van der Waals interactions between adjacent lipid molecules. Longer-tailed lipids have more area over which to interact, increasing the strength of this interaction and, as a consequence, decreasing the lipid mobility. Thus, at a given temperature, a short-tailed lipid will be more fluid than an otherwise identical long-tailed lipid. Transition temperature can also be affected by the degree of unsaturation of the lipid tails. An unsaturated double bond can produce a kink in the alkane chain, disrupting the lipid packing. This disruption creates extra <b>free</b> <b>space</b> within the bilayer that allows additional flexibility in the adjacent chains. An example of this effect can be noted in everyday life as butter, which has a large percentage saturated fats, is solid at room temperature while vegetable oil, which is mostly unsaturated, is liquid.|$|E

5|$|Conversely, {{one might}} expect that {{inertial}} motions, once identified by observing the actual motions of bodies and making allowances for the external forces (such as electromagnetism or friction), {{can be used to}} define the geometry of space, as well as a time coordinate. However, there is an ambiguity once gravity comes into play. According to Newton's law of gravity, and independently verified by experiments such as that of Eötvös and its successors (see Eötvös experiment), there is a universality of free fall (also known as the weak equivalence principle, or the universal equality of inertial and passive-gravitational mass): the trajectory of a test body in free fall depends only on its position and initial speed, but not on any of its material properties. A simplified version of this is embodied in Einstein's elevator experiment, illustrated in the figure on the right: for an observer in a small enclosed room, it is impossible to decide, by mapping the trajectory of bodies such as a dropped ball, whether the room is at rest in a gravitational field, or in <b>free</b> <b>space</b> aboard a rocket that is accelerating at a rate equal to that of the gravitational field.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19thcentury the {{population}} of London more than doubled, from a little under a million people in 1801 to almost two and a half million in 1851. The city's dead had been buried in and around the local churches. With a limited amount of space for burials, the oldest graves were regularly exhumed to <b>free</b> <b>space</b> for new burials. Despite the rapid growth in population, the amount of land set aside for use as graveyards remained unchanged at approximately 300acres (0.5sqmi; 1.2km2), spread across around 200 small sites. Even relatively fresh graves had to be exhumed to free up space for new burials, their contents being unearthed and scattered. Decaying corpses contaminated the water supply, and the city suffered regular epidemics of cholera, smallpox, measles and typhoid. A Royal Commission established in 1842 to investigate the problem concluded that London's burial grounds had become so overcrowded that it was impossible to dig a new grave without cutting through an existing one. In 1848–49 a cholera epidemic killed 14,601 people in London and overwhelmed the burial system completely.|$|E

30|$|An {{exemplar of}} {{different}} classes of fibers formed under different solution conditions {{are illustrated in}} Figure  4 A(b), B(b), and C(b) and marked by a dotted white ellipse. We have found that under a given solution condition the self-organization of a microtubule fiber imposes a set of topological restrictions onto microtubules that constitute the fiber. We have found variable, nanometer-size microtubule <b>free</b> <b>spaces</b> located between fiber microtubules that are approaching/receding (i.e. tip-to-tip), along the same fiber track (Figure  4 A(c)), B(c), see also an illustration of the interface gap in Figure  8 A). As already mentioned, we termed these nano-spaces interface gaps. The nanometer-size microtubule <b>free</b> <b>spaces,</b> between tip-to-tip fiber microtubules are also observed in a microtubule MAPs free system, where fibers are ordered by strong external magnetic fields [54]. In our system, MAPs are present and fibers are spontaneously self-organized. It was also shown that microtubules undergo spontaneous self-organization {{in the form of}} liquid nematic crystals under solution conditions commensurable with ours [55]. Importantly, the pattern of nematic liquid crystals implicates the existence of microtubule <b>free</b> <b>spaces</b> between tip-to-tip of axially approaching microtubules. The microtubule <b>free</b> <b>spaces</b> are also present in the fibers of axonal microtubules that have an axially shifted configuration [56],[57]. Therefore, the presence of the microtubule interface gap, under a variety of experimental conditions, may perhaps suggest that it has a regulatory role in events that may be transmitted along individual fiber microtubules such as mechanical force, energy and information processing [26],[39],[58]–[61]. This may be critical in cellular wound healing [62],[63].|$|R
