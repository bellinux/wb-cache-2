50|$|Porosity {{resulting}} from <b>gas</b> <b>entrapment</b> and solidification shrinkage {{is a significant}} problem in spray formed materials. A typical spray formed billet will contain 1-2% porosity with a pore size dependent on alloy freezing range and various process parameters. Hot isostatic pressing (HIPing) or thermo-mechanical processing can heal these pores if they are small (less than 30 µm). Despite these disadvantages, spray forming remains an economic process {{for the production of}} difficult to manufacture, niche alloys. Large-scale porosity is more difficult to heal effectively and must be minimised by careful process control. In some cases, porosity is controlled by alloy additions which react with dissolved and entrapped gas to form a solid phase e.g. titanium added to copper billets to form titanium nitride with dissolved and entrapped nitrogen gas. Porosity, even after consolidation, can limit the applications of spray formed material, for example rotating gas turbine components must have zero porosity because of the detrimental effect on high-cycle fatigue (HCF).|$|E

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{interactions}} of carbonaceous materials (metallurgical coke, natural graphite and HDPE/coke blends) with three EAF slags [FeO: 24 % to 32 %]. Experiments were conducted using the sessile drop technique (1500 °C- 1600 °C) with off-gases (CO, CO 2) measured using an IR analyzer; the wetting behaviour was determined from contact angle measurements. Estimation of slag foaming behaviour was determined from the droplet volume changes calculated using specialized software. At 1550 °C, all slags were non-wetting with coke due to increased surface tension due to sulphur. At 1550 °C, slag 1 was initially non-wetting on natural graphite due to <b>gas</b> <b>entrapment</b> in the slag droplet; the wetting improved after that. Other slags showed comparatively better wetting. At 1600 °C, all slags were non-wetting with coke. Slags showed a shift from non-wetting to wetting behaviour with natural graphite. Slag/coke reactions produced high off-gases levels causing extensive FeO reduction; <b>gas</b> <b>entrapment</b> in the slag was poor (small volume droplets). Slag/natural graphite interactions revealed both slow gas generation rates and FeO reduction, and excellent <b>gas</b> <b>entrapment</b> (higher droplet volumes) with minor changes in slag properties due to low ash levels.

Slag interactions with coke/HDPE blends showed increasing off-gas levels with increasing HDPE levels. Blend# 3 produced the highest off-gas levels, extensive FeO reduction and displayed significantly higher slag foaming and better wetting compared to coke. Our line on trends compared well for slag/carbon interactions and resulted in deceased specific energy consumption and carbon usage and increased productivity. These findings have enhanced the possibility of utilizing polymeric wastes in blends with coke in EAF steelmaking for slag/carbon interactions...|$|E

40|$|With the {{proliferation}} of renewable energy sources, {{there has been a}} growing interest in battery chemistries for grid scale energy storage. Aqueous sodium ion batteries are particularly interesting for large scale energy storage because of their low cost and high safety, however, they tend to show poor long term stability. NaTi 2 (PO 4) 3 shows promise as an anode for these systems with excellent long term stability when cycled quickly. When cycled slowly, NaTi 2 (PO 4) 3 shows rapid capacity fade. The reasons for this rate depend capacity fade is poorly understood and is the topic of this document. It has been found that the products of the hydrogen evolution reaction, H 2 (g) and OH-, are the two largest contributors to capacity fade. High electrolyte pH caused by generation of OH- promotes dissolution of NTP during extend cycling, this is exacerbated when the pH increase above 11. The single greatest cause of apparent capacity fade for this material is loss of electrochemical surface area due to hydrogen <b>gas</b> <b>entrapment</b> within the porous structure of the electrode. Capacity lost in this manner can be recovered through reinfiltration of the electrode. The detrimental effects of <b>gas</b> <b>entrapment</b> within the electrode can be partially mitigated through compositing of the electrode with activated carbon and enhancing the wettability of the pores through addition of a surfactant to the electrolyte...|$|E

For materials with <b>gas</b> bubble <b>entrapment,</b> the deformation behaviors and other mechanical properties are different from traditional unsaturated conditions where gas phase is assumed connected (Wheeler 1988; Sills et al. 1991). Materials containing gas bubbles are considered as a special type of engineering materials and are usually considered as “quasi-saturated” (Faybishenko 1995). In these materials, gas phase could be present as isolated bubbles once the water saturation degree is larger than 85  % (Sparks 1963). Studies have shown that gas bubbles present in offshore soils due to the decomposition of sedimentary organic matter (Whelan et al. 1975).

30|$|Uplift {{denudation}} greatly {{influences the}} hydrocarbon accumulation (damage). The burial {{depth of the}} stratum becomes shallower during uplift denudation, with changes in groundwater dynamic field conditions, the formation water nature, {{and the development of}} fracture systems. Strong hydrodynamic conditions will cause morphological changes in oil and gas reservoirs, changes in the oil (gas) interface position, and even the displacement of oil and <b>gas</b> in <b>entrapments.</b> Studies have shown that the deep formation water is generally slowly alternating and stagnation filtration water, with calcium chloride water as the main type, which gradually changes upwards to magnesium chloride and finally becomes sodium bicarbonate or sodium sulfate-type water. The groundwater is moveable, which is unfavorable for preservation. The uplift process is also accompanied by changes in the underground temperature–pressure field. The temperature is gradually lowered to the surface temperature to avoid the decomposition and breakage of oil and gas in the hydrocarbon source rock due to high temperature; the pressure is reduced and an extensive development of joint fissures of brittle rock is caused by the release of confining pressure, which can improve the transport conditions of shale gas and the porosity and permeability of reservoir. However, the trap preservation conditions of the oil and gas reservoir will be destroyed when the open fracture system is connected with the Earth’s surface. In addition, the oil and gas will dissipate upwards when the reservoir cap is eroded or the dip angle of some areas becomes larger, which is due to the weakened closure of the overlying strata.|$|R

Along these lines, Parker and Lenhard (1987) developed a model that includes effects of <b>gas</b> <b>entrapment</b> during imbibition. Their model defines limiting maximum capillary heads for drainage and minimum capillary heads for imbibition.

40|$|The {{transition}} from viscous to brittle behavior in magmas plays a decisive {{role in determining}} the style of volcanic eruptions. While this transition has been determined for one- or two-phase systems, it remains poorly constrained for natural magmas containing silicic melt, crystals, and gas bubbles. Here, we present new experimental results on shear-induced fracturing of three-phase magmas obtained at high-temperature (673 – 1023 K) and high-pressure (200 MPa) conditions over a wide range of strain-rates (5 · 10 − 6 s− 1 – 4 · 10 − 3 s− 1). During the experiments bubbles are deformed (i. e., capillary number is in excess of 1) enough to coalesce and generate a porous network that potentially leads to outgassing. A physical relationship is proposed that quantifies the critical stress required for magmas to fail as a function of both crystal (0. 24 – 0. 65) and bubble volume fractions (0. 09 – 0. 12). The presented results demonstrate efficient outgassing for low crystal fraction (0. 44) promote <b>gas</b> bubble <b>entrapment</b> and inhibit outgassing. The failure of bubble-free, crystal-bearing systems is enhanced by the presence of bubbles that lower the critical failure stress in a regime of efficient outgassing, while the failure stress is increased if bubbles remain trapped within the crystal framework. These contrasting behaviors have direct impact on the style of volcanic eruptions. During magma ascent, efficient outgassing reduces the potential for an explosive eruption and favors brittle behavior, contributing to maintain low overpressures in an active volcanic system resulting in effusion or rheological flow blockage of magma at depth. Conversely, magmas with high crystallinity experience limited loss of exsolved gas, permitting the achievement of larger overpressures prior to a potential sudden transition to brittle behavior, which could result in an explosive volcanic eruption...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The fluid bulk {{stiffness}} of a soil is {{very sensitive to}} the presence of gas, and a small volume of bubbles can significantly affect the pore pressure response to loading, including Skempton’s B parameter, P-wave velocity, and liquefaction resistance. Biologically mediated processes can lead to the production of gases in soils; nitrogen is particularly advantageous because it is not a greenhouse gas, it is not combustible, and it has low solubility in water. Sands, silts, and clayey sands inoculated with Paracoccus denitrificans were monitored to assess the effects of nutrient availability, fines content, and pressure-diffusion on the evolution of nitrogen gas generation and bulk stiffness. Results show clear evidence of biogas bubble formation, earlier <b>gas</b> generation and <b>entrapment</b> in specimens with higher fines content, and a strong correlation between biogas volume and P-wave velocity. The volume of gas is correlated with specific surface, suggesting that biogas bubble formation develops as heterogeneous nucleation and that it is directly linked to the availability of nucleation sites on mineral surfaces, which in turn also affect the degree of attainable supersaturation. Results support the viability of biogenic gas generation as a tool to increase the liquefaction resistance of soils subjected to cyclic loading.
