40|$|From a {{tribological}} {{point of}} view, {{the selection of}} materials for seals for valves of cryogenic rocket engines is a critical issue for the designer. Due {{to the lack of}} comprehensive information on this topic. data have been obtained in the framework of research programmes. In the first step, two polymers potentially usable for sealing cryogenic fluids were identified, They were submitted to <b>general</b> <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> to gain some fundamental understanding of their tribological behaviour when immersed in a cryogenic fluid. This fundamental understanding proved to be helpful for an efficient technical approach. This approach with the test conditions {{as close as possible to}} those met in real valves has been used in the second step. In order to obtain the best information with the minimum number of tests, the statistical method of Doehlert has been adopted. The use of such a method led to the construction of surface response for modelling friction and wear. These surfaces and their associated equation are directly and easily usable by the designer, This way of treating technical tribological problem is illustrated by an example.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{was part of}} the session : Extreme EnvironmentsSixth International Planetary Probe WorkshopOn January 15 th 2006, the STARDUST capsule re-entered Earth's atmosphere after its almost seven year journey with a re-entry speed of 12. 8 km/s. Due {{to the nature of the}} mission, no diagnostics for the re-entry phase were installed on the capsule. Nevertheless, this was the fastest re-entry of a human made space vehicle ever and data on heat shield erosion and plasma characterization is considered to be very valuable for further missions since the entry conditions are typical for hyperbolic re-entries for sample return missions e. g. from Mars. Therefore, an observation mission was initiated by NASA aboard the NASA DC- 8 airborne observatory [1]. Among experiments conducted by American and Japanese researchers, a contribution of Germany was made by the SLIT experiment. Here, a conventional spectrometer in a Cerny Turner configuration was fed by fiber optics with light collected by a small mirror telescope. Data was taken during 30 s around the point of maximum heating until the capsule left the accessible observation region. Due to difficulties in tracking not every spectrum contained data. Nevertheless, the emission of CN as a major erosion product of the PICA (Phenolic-Impregnated Carbon Ablator) heat shield material as well as N 2 + and different atoms could be monitored successfully during that time. Due to the nature of the set up, no spatial resolution of the radiation data was achieved. Thus all measured values represent integration over both the visible part of the glowing heat shield and the plasma in the post shock region. The measured spectra were split up into continuum spectra, which represent a superposition of the heat shield radiation and the continuum radiation of potential dust particles in the plasma, and into line spectra of the plasma in the post shock layer. Planck temperatures and rotational and vibrational temperatures of CN and N 2 + were extracted over the visible trajectory [2]. The paper provides a short summary of the obtained spectra for different flight altitudes of the STARDUST capsule. Furthermore a comparison of said spectra to the results of numerical simulations of the plasma emission with PARADE and URANUS radiation / flow field simulations will be presented. In order to further interpret the obtained data, ground testing at the IRS plasma wind tunnels (PWT) is required [3]. Among others, methods of measurement used in the IRS facilities include optical plasma diagnostics such as emission spectroscopy [4, 5], Fabry Perot interferometry, laser induced fluorescence and laser absorption spectroscopy. Thus, suitable measurement techniques for testing must be selected, essentially including emission spectroscopy in order to facilitate plasma characterization and consequently the comparability of PWK experimental results to the data obtained during STARDUST observation. Furthermore, <b>testing</b> <b>conditions</b> are identified and assessed. Here, constant surface heat flux is chosen as a <b>general</b> <b>testing</b> <b>condition</b> in a first approach. In addition, different ablative materials for testing are selected, starting with graphite as a basic material and including if possible the original PICA TPS or else, similar materials. Graphite ablation has previously been analyzed in the diffusion controlled temperature region (1600 K - 2300 K) at high flow velocities up to 1 km/s demanding for further experiments at higher temperatures.

The <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> chosen were {{a test case}} relevant to LPP (lean premixed prevaporized combustion) for gas turbines (pair= 15. 5 bar, Tair= 750 K) and the corresponding cold <b>test</b> <b>condition</b> in terms of air density (pair= 6 bar, Tair= 290 K). Both test cases were investigated in the absence {{as well as in}} the presence of a filmer plate on which part of the nascent fuel spray impinges. The nozzle diameter was 0. 45 mm and the fuel flowrate was 2. 94 g/s, so that the fuel-to-air momentum flux ratio q (q=(rliq*uliq 2) /(rair*uair 2)) assumed a value of 6.

Specifically, the analysis was aimed at developing an {{analytical model}} capable of predicting the hydrogen leak rates from a crack in the combustion chamber coolant discharge manifold on main engine 1 of the Orbiter Challenger that was discovered during flight readiness firings 1 and 2.

Results of inter-laboratory ageing studies of roll-to-roll and spin coated samples with correspondingly flexible plastic packaging and glass encapsulation tested under dark <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> among 7 laboratories are presented.

40|$|Tunnelling below water {{passages}} is {{a challenging}} task {{in terms of}} planning, pre-investigation and construction. Fracture zones in the underlying bedrock lead to low rock quality and thus reduced stability. For natural reasons, {{they tend to be}} more frequent at water passages. Ground investigations that provide information on the subsurface are necessary prior to the construction phase, but these can be logistically difficult. Geophysics can help close the gaps between local point information by producing subsurface images. An approach that combines seismic refraction tomography and electrical resistivity tomography has been tested at the Äspö Hard Rock Laboratory (HRL). The aim was to detect fracture zones in a well-known but logistically challenging area from a measuring perspective. The presented surveys cover a water passage along part of a tunnel that connects surface facilities with an underground test laboratory. The tunnel is approximately 100  m below and 20  m east of the survey line and gives evidence for one major and several minor fracture zones. The geological and <b>general</b> <b>test</b> site <b>conditions,</b> e. g.  with strong power line noise from the nearby nuclear power plant, are challenging for geophysical measurements. Co-located positions for seismic and ERT sensors and source positions are used on the 450  m underwater section of the 700  m profile. Because of a large transition zone that appeared in the ERT result and the missing coverage of the seismic data, fracture zones at the southern and northern parts of the underwater passage cannot be detected by separated inversion. Synthetic studies show that significant three-dimensional (3 -D) artefacts occur in the ERT model that even exceed the positioning errors of underwater electrodes. The model coverage is closely connected to the resolution and can be used to display the model uncertainty by introducing thresholds to fade-out regions of medium and low resolution. A structural coupling cooperative inversion approach is able to image the northern fracture zone successfully. In addition, previously unknown sedimentary deposits with a significantly large thickness are detected in the otherwise unusually well-documented geological environment. The results significantly improve the imaging of some geologic features, which would have been undetected or misinterpreted otherwise, and combines the images by means of cluster analysis into a conceptual subsurface model...|$|R

Three different <b>test</b> <b>conditions,</b> each one of them a film showing objects and corresponding phrases made of randomly generated artificial words, were designed. The structure of the first, high variability <b>test</b> <b>condition</b> included context-dependent information and the structures of the second and the third, low variability <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> were characterised by frequent nonsense target-word rate, target-words occurring in phrase final position. The aim of the artificial input language was to ensure the novelty of test material, and to simulate the type of learning situation - when the semantic content of words is arbitrary - facing young infants in the beginning of language learning. Analysis of informants looking behaviour, prior to, and after exposure to the objects and the corresponding audio input, were performed. Results showed that the structure of high variability <b>test</b> <b>condition</b> and the structure of low variability <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> were associated with significant between-group differences. This finding indicates that the nonsense phrases in low variability <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> managed to 'explain' the objects just like semantically meaningful phrases do.
