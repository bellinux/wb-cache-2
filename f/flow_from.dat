5|$|Normal {{blood flow}} is {{anterograde}} (going to the heart), and from superficial to deep veins via perforator veins.

5|$|The {{winds are}} {{predominantly}} northern.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop a {{framework}} which {{is appropriate for}} the systematic investigation {{of the relationship between}} net (and gross) flows between different labour market states and movements in the unemployment rate. We use that framework to investigate the behaviour of net flows of persons between employment, unemployment and not in the labour force in Australia between 1979 - 2003 and the relationship of these flows to changes in the unemployment rate over that period. We find that: <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> unemployment to employment exceed <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> employment to unemployment and that this is the case even in recessions; <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> employment to not in the labour force exceed <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> not in the labour force to employment and that this is the case even in booms, and; <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> not in the labour force to unemployment exceed <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> unemployment to not in the labour force even in recessions. Another important finding is that the reason why the participation rate is negatively correlated with the unemployment rate is because net <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> employment to both unemployment and to not in the labour force are highly correlated. It cannot be explained by flows occurring between unemployment and not in the labour force. Worker Flows Business Cycle Unemployment Participation Rate...|$|R
5|$|A weak {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on June 12. It tracked westward across the tropical Atlantic Ocean with minimal convection, and subsequent to moving through the southern Windward Islands it crossed northern Central America. Convection increased on June 20 as the wave entered the southwestern Caribbean. Under the influence of southeasterly <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> developing Hurricane Celia in the eastern Pacific Ocean and the south-southwesterly <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> a mid- to upper-level trough over the Gulf of Mexico, the area of disturbed weather tracked generally north-northwestward through the Caribbean Sea while spreading across Cuba and southern Florida. On June 24, a mid-level circulation developed near the Yucatán Channel, and shortly thereafter satellite image loops indicated deep convection with some cyclonic rotation near the western tip of Cuba. A reconnaissance aircraft flight was dispatched late on June 24 into the system to determine if it developed into a tropical cyclone, though the flight did not observe evidence of a closed low-level circulation. Subsequent to the flight, satellite imagery indicated a low-level circulation was forming, and on June 25 ship and buoy data confirmed the system developed into Tropical Depression One while located about 235miles (375km) west-southwest of Key West, Florida. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center incorrectly classified the system as Tropical Depression Two due to an earlier subtropical storm.|$|E
5|$|At some {{distance}} {{back from the}} leading edge, the smooth laminar flow breaks down and transitions to a turbulent <b>flow.</b> <b>From</b> a drag standpoint, it is advisable to have the transition from laminar to turbulent flow as far aft on the wing as possible, or have {{a large amount of}} the wing surface within the laminar portion of the boundary layer. The low energy laminar flow, however, tends to break down more suddenly than the turbulent layer.|$|E
5|$|By {{historical}} convention, {{a positive}} current {{is defined as}} having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, {{one of the most}} familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of an iron core, Ganymede's magnetosphere remains enigmatic, particularly given that similar bodies lack the feature. Some research has suggested that, given its relatively small size, the core ought to have sufficiently cooled to the point where fluid motions, hence a magnetic field would not be sustained. One explanation is that the same orbital resonances proposed to have disrupted the surface also allowed the magnetic field to persist: with Ganymede's eccentricity pumped and tidal heating of the mantle increased during such resonances, reducing heat <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> the core, leaving it fluid and convective. Another explanation is a remnant magnetization of silicate rocks in the mantle, which is possible if the satellite had a more significant dynamo-generated field in the past.|$|E
5|$|However, {{because the}} planet is {{rotating}} underneath the atmosphere, and frictional forces arise as the planetary surface drags some atmosphere with it, the air <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> center to periphery is not direct, but is twisted due to the Coriolis effect, or the merely apparent force that arise when the observer is in a rotating frame of reference. Viewed from above this twist in wind direction {{is in the same}} direction as the rotation of the planet.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} for {{thousands}} of years in or around the Everglades. Plans arose in 1882 to drain the wetlands and develop the land for agricultural and residential use. As the 20th century progressed, water <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> Lake Okeechobee was increasingly controlled and diverted to enable explosive growth of the South Florida metropolitan area. The park was established in 1934, to protect the quickly vanishing Everglades, and dedicated in 1947, as major canal building projects were initiated across South Florida. The ecosystems in Everglades National Park have suffered significantly from human activity, and restoration of the Everglades is a politically charged issue in South Florida.|$|E
