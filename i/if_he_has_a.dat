5|$|Red Dead Redemption {{makes use}} of a {{morality}} system where players {{have the ability to}} gain positive or negative honor. Honor can be gained by making morally positive choices, such as taking in an outlaw alive or saving a woman from a kidnapping. The player character's overall honor standard is lowered for committing crimes or other negative choices. This works in conjunction with another system, fame, which affects how people react based on Marston's honor status. If Marston has little honor, non-player characters will feel insecure around him. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> high amount of honor, other characters will usually greet him and feel safe around him. He will also receive discounts in some stores, more pay for jobs and other bonuses. A very low honor rating can result in a town's establishments closing their doors when Marston arrives. To combat this he can disguise himself by wearing a bandana when performing criminal acts; alternatively, a very negative or criminal reputation warrants the player a large amount of respect and steep discounts from bandits and fencers at criminal hideouts, such as Thieves' Landing.|$|E
5|$|The single-player mode lets players control three characters: Michael De Santa, Trevor Philips and Franklin Clinton—criminals whose stories {{interconnect}} as they complete missions. Some {{missions are}} completed {{with only one}} character and others feature two or three. Outside the missions, players may switch between characters at will {{by means of a}} directional compass on the HUD. The game may switch characters automatically during missions to complete certain objectives. A character's compass avatar will flash red if he is in danger and needs help, and flash white <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> strategic advantage. Though players complete missions as any of the three protagonists, the more difficult heist missions require aid from AI-controlled accomplices with unique skill sets like computer hacking and driving. If an accomplice survives a successful heist, they take a cut from the cash reward and may be available for later missions with improvements to their unique skills. There are multiple options for completing heists; in a holdup mission, players may either stealthily subdue civilians with an incapacitating agent or conspicuously storm the venue with guns drawn.|$|E

25|$|Both Chilean men {{and women}} qualify for a family {{allowance}} if they have dependent {{children under the age}} of eighteen (or twenty-four if in school). There are differences in entitlement requirements for the spouse-related family allowance since a man qualifies for a family allowance <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> dependent wife, but a woman only qualifies for a family allowance if her husband is disabled. Until a reform of paternity laws in 1998, children born outside marriage had less right to parental financial support and inheritance than children born within marriage. A bill was passed in 2007 to give mothers direct access to child support payments.|$|E
25|$|The mortal Lutin arrives. He {{is just as}} enchanted {{with the}} fairies as Sir Ethais and Sir Phyllon were in Act I, and they are {{similarly}} impressed with him. Lutin is so taken with Fairyland that he calls it Paradise and assumes he must be dead. The fairies explain the situation, and they all vie for his attention, saying that they prefer his rugged appearance to men that are handsome. Zayda persuades all the other fairies to find food for Lutin. When they have left, she tells him {{that all of the}} other fairies have faults, and that she is the only fairy worthy of his esteem. When the other fairies return, they ask Lutin <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> wife. He replies that he is married down below, but is a bachelor in Fairyland, which offends Zayda.|$|E
25|$|Prosopis cineraria is much valued as a fodder tree. The {{trees are}} heavily lopped {{particularly}} during winter months when no {{other green fodder}} {{is available in the}} dry tracts. There is a popular saying that death will not visit a man, even at the time of a famine, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> Prosopis cineraria, a goat and a camel, since the three together are some what said to sustain a man even under the most trying condition. The forage yield per tree varies a great deal. On an average, the yield of green forage from a full grown tree is expected to be about 60kg with complete lopping having only the central leading shoot, 30kg when the lower two third crown is lopped and 20kg when the lower one third crown is lopped. The leaves are of high nutritive value. Feeding of the leaves during winter when no other green fodder is generally available in rain-fed areas is thus profitable. The pods have a sweetish pulp and are also used as fodder for livestock.|$|E

Agnes confronts Kat and Alfie, so Kat realises that Lance told her why they are there. Agnes says Kat gave up her right to see her son when she gave him up, but Kat explains {{she did not know}} she had a son as she had passed out during the birth. Dermott and Tommy hear this, and Tommy asks <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> big brother. Later, Kat and Alfie decide to return to Spain, but Tommy wants to find his brother. Tommy sneaks out of the house, and Kat and Alfie try to find him. Andrew's mother, Roisín Kelly (Maria Doyle Kennedy), tells Kat that she saw Tommy at the church, so they go there, followed by Agnes. They find Dermott praying with Tommy, who tells Kat that he found his brother. Kat realises that Dermott is her son, and Dermott confirms this. In episode 3, Kat and Dermott have bonded, but she lies to him about who his real father is. Dermott worries that Tommy will tell Peter the truth and threatens him. Alfie realises that Kat lied to Dermott, which results in an argument. Dermott overhears them arguing about him not knowing the truth and Kat refusing to tell him.|$|E

500|$|In 1919, Ponsford was {{selected}} for Victoria's baseball team, alongside future Test cricket teammate Jack Ryder. In 1923, The Sporting Globe claimed that Ponsford was [...] "...the best batter of the season.... Indeed, as an all-round man, it is doubtful <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> superior in the state." [...] In 1925, Ponsford captained the Victorian team and {{was selected}} as centre fielder in an Australian representative team that played three matches against an outfit from the United States Pacific Fleet, which had docked in Melbourne. Over the three matches, won by the Australians, Ponsford made five safe hits, gained eight bases and his batting average was [...]357. Ponsford's next match against American opposition was against a team from Stanford University that visited Australia in 1927. Ponsford's Victorian team defeated Stanford 5–3; it was the visitors' only loss on the tour.|$|E
500|$|Mitsuda names his {{favorite}} works as the soundtracks to the Chrono series, Xenogears, Xenosaga Episode I, {{and the original}} album Kirite, though {{he also says that}} all of his soundtracks are [...] "representational works", as they represent who he was as a composer when he made them. His favorite pieces overall are [...] "The Girl Who Closed Her Heart" [...] and [...] "Pain" [...] from Xenosaga Episode I and pieces from Kirite. When he starts to compose a soundtrack, he first takes one month to gather information and artwork about the game world and scenario, so that his music will fit in with the game. He also finds it easier to be inspired <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> visual representation. Mitsuda claims that he does not save his best work for more popular games, as he tries to compose each piece to correspond to how {{it is going to be}} used in a specific game. He also tries to compose good pieces even for games he feels do not live up to them, so that they will be a redeeming point about the game for the players. The majority of his video game soundtracks are for role-playing games, but he likes projects that are different from what he has done before and is interested in working in other genres.|$|E
500|$|In the game, {{the player}} uses the {{directional}} pad to move Wonder Boy left or right, crouch down (only possible as Hu-Man or Lizard-Man), or to enter doors. The {{buttons on the}} controller are used to attack enemies and to jump. Wonder Boy can attack with his main weapon or with secondary weapons by holding down on the directional pad and pressing the attack button. Pressing the pause button brings up the Status Screen (and pauses the game if Wonder Boy is fighting a dragon). Wonder Boy has a life meter shown {{on the top of}} the gameplay area by a series of hearts. When all hearts turn black, Wonder Boy dies and the game ends, but <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> life potion ("medicine vial" [...] in Dragon's Curse) remaining, he will revive with some of the hearts refilled. After the game ends, the player is taken to a [...] "continue screen"; there the player has an opportunity to win a free life potion before restarting the game at the town. Players can visit the town's church to receive a password in order to continue the game at a later time. The password saves the current player's form, equipment, and amount of gold; but it does not save any secondary weapons or life potions in stock. Dragon's Curse has a [...] "file cabinet" [...] which allows players to store passwords into the game's memory.|$|E

2500|$|The touch-move rule in chess {{specifies}} that, if {{a player}} deliberately touches a piece on the board when it is his turn to move, then he must move or capture that piece if it is legal to do so. [...] If it is the player's piece that was touched, it must be moved <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> legal move. [...] If the opponent's piece was touched, it must be captured {{if it can be}} captured with a legal move. [...] This is a rule of chess that is enforced in all games played in over-the-board competitions. The player claiming a touch-move violation must do so before making a move.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are also}} {{positions}} {{in which a}} king and a knight can checkmate a king and a bishop, knight, or rook; or a king and a bishop can checkmate a king with a bishop on the other color of squares or with a knight, but the checkmate cannot be forced {{if there is no}} other material on the board (see the diagrams for some examples). Nevertheless, it keeps these material combinations from being ruled a draw because of [...] "insufficient mating material" [...] or [...] "impossibility of checkmate" [...] under the FIDE rules of chess. The U.S. Chess Federation rules are different. [...] In a typical position with a minor piece versus a minor piece, a player would be able to claim a draw <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> limited amount of time left.|$|E

[...] When Kramer asks <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> case, Jackie's reply is [...] "Your face is my case." [...] Jackie and Kramer then meet with a tobacco company lawyer, who alleges that Kramer's face gives him a sense of [...] "rugged masculinity." [...] Jackie replies, [...] "Rugged?

Jackie dubs this [...] "the most public yet of my many humiliations." ...|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the simple}} solutions, the [...] "combined doors solution" [...] comes closest to a {{conditional}} solution, {{as we saw}} in the discussion of approaches using the concept of odds and Bayes theorem. It is based on the deeply rooted intuition that revealing information that is already known does not affect probabilities. But, knowing that the host can open one of the two unchosen doors to show a goat does not mean that opening a specific door would not affect the probability that the car is behind the initially chosen door. The point is, though we know in advance that the host will open a door and reveal a goat, we do not know which door he will open. If the host chooses uniformly at random between doors hiding a goat (as is the case in the standard interpretation), this probability indeed remains unchanged, but if the host can choose non-randomly between such doors, then the specific door that the host opens reveals additional information. The host can always open a door revealing a goat and (in the standard interpretation of the problem) the probability that the car is behind the initially chosen door does not change, but it is not because of the former that the latter is true. Solutions based on the assertion that the host's actions cannot affect the probability that the car is behind the initially chosen appear persuasive, but the assertion is simply untrue unless each of the host's two choices are equally likely, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> choice (...) [...] The assertion therefore needs to be justified; without justification being given, the solution is at best incomplete. The answer can be correct but the reasoning used to justify it is defective.|$|E
2500|$|As an alternative, {{there is}} the [...] "bare king" [...] rule. [...] A {{historic}} description of chu shogi mentions, [...] "When pieces are gone, and there are only the 2 kings, one can mate only <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> promoted gold". Nonetheless, this is only one specific case, and the motivation for such a rule is uncertain given that king and rook (a promoted gold) against king is an easy forced checkmate. The Japanese Chu-Shogi Association has altered this into a general baring rule {{similar to that of}} shatranj, where a bare king immediately loses against any other material, unless you can bare the opponent on the following move (in which case the game is a draw), or you can capture the opponent's sole remaining king or prince on the following move (in which case the opponent loses).("　三.両軍がともに駒を消耗しあい、駒枯れの状態になった場合、玉将２枚と成金１枚だけが盤面に残ったときは成金のある側が勝ちとなります。")An example of this is discussed in section 5.5 of the same page, second diagram. This makes a difference in the endgames of king and pawn against king, or king and ferocious leopard against king, which cannot be won by the stronger side without the bare king rule (and also in some cases with blind tigers, silver generals, and copper generals that can be trapped by the enemy king when separated from their own kings). Further detail is offered in their standardised rules: king and any piece against king is an immediate win by the bare king rule, except if the piece is a pawn or go-between, in which case it must be promoted safely (to a gold general or drunk elephant respectively) before the win can be claimed. Furthermore, [...] "dead pieces" [...] do not count under this rule; a king and an immobile pawn or lance at the far rank against a king is still a draw.|$|E
