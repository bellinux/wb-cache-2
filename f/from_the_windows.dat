5|$|As {{punishment}} for his escape, he {{is forced to}} repeatedly dig a grave-sized hole in the prison camp yard, fill it back in, and then be beaten. The prisoners observe his persecution, singing spirituals. Finally, as the other prisoners watch <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> of the bunkhouse, an exhausted Luke collapses in the hole, begging God for mercy and pleads with the bosses not to hit him again. Believing Luke is finally broken, the Captain stops the punishment. Boss Paul warns Luke {{that he will be}} killed if ever he runs away again, which Luke promises in tears not to do. The prisoners begin to lose their idealized image of Luke, and one tears up the photograph of Luke with the women.|$|E
5|$|A {{ceremony}} of dedication {{was held on}} the afternoon of October 28, 1886. President Grover Cleveland, the former New York governor, presided over the event. On the morning of the dedication, a parade was held in New York City; {{estimates of the number of}} people who watched it ranged from several hundred thousand to a million. President Cleveland headed the procession, then stood in the reviewing stand to see bands and marchers from across America. General Stone was the grand marshal of the parade. The route began at Madison Square, once the venue for the arm, and proceeded to the Battery at the southern tip of Manhattan by way of Fifth Avenue and Broadway, with a slight detour so the parade could pass in front of the World building on Park Row. As the parade passed the New York Stock Exchange, traders threw ticker tape <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> beginning the New York tradition of the ticker-tape parade.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Boles's men {{concentrated}} to the north-west {{corner of}} town, before the Church of St Lawrence. A regiment of Waller's infantry, five companies of Haslerig's, and five companies of Kentish Men attacked Alton {{from the north}} and north-west. The Royalist infantry, however, took effective cover inside buildings, out of which they fired quickly; they particularly favoured a large brick house near the church. This house, however, was soon abandoned as Waller's artillery, positioned {{at the foot of the}} hill to the west, fired upon it, forcing these defenders to retreat to the church. The Parliamentary regiments from London and four companies from Farnham Castle descended the hill: Waller's Red Regiment attacked a lunette and breastwork which the Royalists had built and which they were using as an effective fortification. The Green Regiment flanked the Royalists which were behind these fortifications forcing them out, while marching through town under the cover of smoke from a thatch house which they had set on fire. Soon after, the rest of Waller's men entered the town en masse, flying their colours and pushing Boles's men back to the Church of St Lawrence. From the church and nearby fortifications (including a large earthwork on its north side), the Royalists held their ground for two hours. The Royalists fired <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> of the church, and employed a scaffolding inside the church proper to fire from greater heights.|$|E

25|$|Windows ME was {{conceived}} as a quick one-year project {{that served as a}} stopgap release between Windows 98 and Windows XP. Many of the new features were available <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Windows</b> Update site as updates for older Windows versions. As a result, Windows ME was not acknowledged as a distinct operating system along the lines of 95 or 98, and is often included in the Windows 9x series.|$|E

25|$|At sea, {{manoeuvres}} {{were slightly}} different {{and more complex}} because the operator would {{need to find a}} proper and stable place to fire. Some Hwacha operators preferred to be on the rowers' deck where they were able to shoot <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> while others preferred to be on the main deck so they could shoot at the sails of the enemy ships. These kind of manoeuvres were particularly seen on Korean Panokseon warships.|$|E

25|$|Boudin and du Pont also competed {{to design}} window {{treatments}} for the Red Room. Boudin suggested straight panels of cerise silk, suspended from a gilded wood rod and rings. Du Pont proposed a lighter treatment of white cotton voile or muslin, drawn back <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> with tassels. Mrs. Kennedy {{was concerned that}} du Pont's drapes would require constant pressing in order to look good, and that souvenir-hunters might snip at the tassels and fringe. Boudin's scheme won out.|$|E
25|$|Notepad accepts text <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Windows</b> {{clipboard}}. When clipboard {{data with}} multiple formats is pasted into Notepad, the program only accepts {{text in the}} CF_TEXT format. This is useful for stripping embedded font type and style codes from formatted text, such as when copying text from a web page and pasting into an email message or other WYSIWYG text editor. Formatted text can be temporarily pasted into Notepad, and then immediately copied again in stripped format to paste into the other program.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the SSG commandos {{had reached}} the area and {{surrounded}} the administration block.

25|$|In these {{circumstances}} the Poles began a counter-attack aimed at capturing Igelström's palace and {{the positions of}} the forces that he had around him. These included a battalion under Johann Jakob Pistor; a battalion drawn from Marywil commanded by Colonel Parfyeniev; a battalion of the famed Siberian Regiment; and some cavalry under Brigadier Baur. All but Parfyeniev's men had previously been involved in the failed assaults at the Arsenal and towards the Royal Castle, and all were battle-hardened. As the Poles took several buildings along Senatorska Street opposite the palace and fired at the Russians <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> the Russians could not reorganise their ranks and hid in the palace and the nearby Capuchin Church. Before 16:00, Działyński's Regiment reached Senatorska Street and began a frontal assault on the palace, but was bloodily repelled by the Russian defenders. Constant fire <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> and roofs of nearby houses prevented them from mounting a counter-attack and both sides reached a stalemate. Because of that Igelström was left with little option but to await reinforcements from the outside, which did not happen. After dark a small unit under Major Titov broke through to Igelström, but his force was not strong enough to break the stalemate.|$|E
25|$|We do not {{understand}} exactly how Renaissance artists thought about the Oriental carpets they were depicting. We know that the Venetian Piazza San Marco was adorned with carpets hanging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> of the surrounding palaces and houses on special occasions. Like the beautiful ladies looking out of the windows, the carpets function as a decorative framework, and highlight the important action which is going on. Similar to the inaccurate pseudo-kufic writing in contemporary paintings, the European artists borrowed something from another culture which they, essentially, did {{not understand}}.|$|E
25|$|Compared with {{a regular}} {{installation}}, a Wubi installation faces some limitations. Hibernation is not supported and the filesystem is more vulnerable to hard reboots. Also, if the Windows drive is unmounted uncleanly (Windows crash, power failure, etc.), Ubuntu {{will not be able}} to repair, re-mount, and boot <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Windows</b> NTFS drive until Microsoft Windows has successfully booted, repaired the drive, and then shut down cleanly. If the Windows system could not be booted after the corruption to repair the filesystem, the user would also not be able to boot Ubuntu.|$|E

25|$|King Pedro II died in {{his sleep}} on 9 December 1706. Following his death, Ribeira Palace was redecorated as a {{reflection}} of the mourning. On the façade towards the Terreiro do Paço, large black banners were hung <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> for this purpose. A month later, the time was declared to be appropriate for John to be acclaimed king. Preparations for John's acclamation had already been started and once allowed, the royal palace was redecorated; the black banners were replaced with red ones, and fruit wreaths were hung throughout all of the palace.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, {{a dispute}} between preservationists and {{building}} owner Vornado Realty Trust over the building {{led to a}} suit in court. Vornado received permission from the Landmarks Preservation Commission to modify the building to create a space to accommodate two new stores on Fifth Avenue; the project called for cutting new doorways into the facade, rotating the escalators to move them farther away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> and reducing the vault wall. Vornado hired the original architects, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, to make the changes. Tenants in the building at the time included Bloomberg L.P., the company of New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.|$|E
