25|$|A career-spanning {{series of}} battles with Tie Domi of the New York Rangers, Winnipeg Jets and Toronto Maple Leafs. One of Probert's memorable {{confrontations}} {{was also the}} genesis of Domi's now-infamous belt gesture, where <b>he</b> <b>gestured</b> to the crowd {{as if he had}} a championship title belt around his waist.|$|E
25|$|The {{series against}} Sri Lanka had started in Perth with {{speculation}} regarding Waugh's four consecutive Test ducks. After four hours, Waugh reached his century {{and ended with}} 111 to end his run of ducks. On reaching his century, <b>he</b> <b>gestured</b> to {{a section of the}} crowd who had been heckling him. Australia won by an innings and Waugh then scored 61 in another innings victory in the Second Test at Melbourne. He was batting when off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan was repeatedly no-balled for throwing by Darrell Hair, before being bowled by the spinner. Waugh scored 71 in the Third Test and ended with 255 runs at 63.75 in a series clean sweep.|$|E
500|$|Having found a {{place in}} India's Test squad for the tour of Australia in December 2011, Kohli top-scored with 132 in a tour match against Cricket Australia Chairman's XI to {{strengthen}} his case for {{a spot in the}} playing eleven ahead of Rohit Sharma. Batting at number six, Kohli failed to go past 25 in the first two Tests as his defensive technique was exposed. While fielding on the boundary during {{the second day of the}} second match, <b>he</b> <b>gestured</b> to the crowd with his middle finger for which he was fined 50% of his match fee by the match referee. He top-scored in each of India's innings in the third Test at Perth, with 44 and 75, even as India surrendered to their second consecutive innings defeat. In the fourth and final match at Adelaide, Kohli scored his maiden Test century of 116 runs in the first innings; it was the only century scored by an Indian in the series. India suffered a 0–4 whitewash and Kohli, India's top run-scorer in the series, was described as [...] "the lone bright spot in an otherwise nightmare visit for the tourists".|$|E
50|$|Zeek: Ephraims pet. He's a {{beautiful}} falcon, with sharp markings, an angular beak, and piercing eyes. He has big, sharp talons, which <b>he</b> <b>gestures</b> with as <b>he</b> speaks. He exudes confidence - and with excellent vision, he keeps {{an eye out}} for danger.|$|R
50|$|In Rembrandt's depiction, {{now in the}} Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, he {{presents}} the servant girl who recognizes Peter with a candle, illuminating Peter's face.

500|$|Saint-Just {{saved his}} dignity at the lectern {{but not his}} life. Rising in his support, Robespierre {{sputtered}} and lost his voice; his brother Augustin, Philippe Lebas, and other key allies all tried to sway the deputies, but failed. The meeting ended with an order for their arrest. Saint-Just, still on the platform, remained unmoved and [...] "looked on contemptuously" [...] at the scene. His confidence seemed validated when troops from the Paris Commune under Hanriot arrived to liberate them, but within hours the entire group was confined to the Hôtel de Ville. When soldiers finally broke inside, {{a number of the}} defeated Jacobins tried to commit suicide; Saint-Just stood beside Lebas who shot himself in the head. Any contemplation of his own suicide is unclear, but he alone emerged unruffled from the wild, violent final arrest – among the captured, [...] "only St. Just, his hands bound but his head held high, was able to walk." [...] Robespierre, Saint-Just and twenty of their allies were guillotined the next day, and Saint-Just reputedly accepted his death with coolness and pride. At a last formality of identification, <b>he</b> <b>gestured</b> to a copy of the Constitution of 1793 and said, [...] "I am the one who made that." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the final}} of the Men’s Keirin, Malaysian Azizulhasni Awang was disqualified for {{aggressive}} interference when he forced his way past two competitors. Race winner Josiah Ng said he was [...] "mystified" [...] over Awang's disqualification. In the semi-final round of the keirin, Australia's Shane Perkins was disqualified for dangerous riding with the official reason not being made clear. Perkins subsequently won the classification race and was described by Chris Boardman from the BBC to [...] "have aimed an angry V-sign at officials"; <b>he</b> <b>gestured</b> to the judges with his index and middle finger held together. [...] No subsequent action was taken against Perkins who later said, [...] "the officials {{need to go back to}} school", referencing poor decisions he felt had been made in the sprint and keirin events.|$|E
2500|$|On February 6, Déby, {{who was in}} {{military}} uniform, spoke {{at a press conference}} {{for the first time since}} the battle began, after meeting with Hervé Morin, the French Minister of Defense. Déby said his forces had defeated the rebels, whom he described as [...] "mercenaries directed by Sudan", and that his forces were in [...] "total control" [...] of the city as well as the whole country. Reacting to reports that he had been wounded, <b>he</b> <b>gestured</b> and declared: [...] "Look at me, I'm fine". He said, however, that he did not know the whereabouts of more than three-fourths of the members of his government, and he warned that the issue of [...] "traitors" [...] would be dealt with [...] "when the time comes". Morin suggested that the rebels were not completely routed but were waiting for reinforcements. The Sudanese authorities promptly denied President Déby's accusations of Sudanese involvement. Intelligence forces chief Salah Gosh declared on February 7 that Sudan had [...] "called for the evacuation of the opposition from N'Djamena and the opposition agreed" [...] and [...] "joined efforts with the Libyans on reaching a ceasefire." [...] When Sudanese media aired reports claiming government participation in the attack, the government responded by reimposing a daily censorship on the press from March 6.|$|E

2500|$|Youzhny {{started the}} 2008 season by {{defeating}} world number two Rafael Nadal in under {{an hour at}} {{the final of the}} Chennai Open in India. However, the scoreline did not reflect the circumstances, Nadal's semi-final finished mere hours beforehand and he had little rest. Youzhny admitted as much, and said; [...] "This victory is a present from Rafael", but Nadal responded by saying [...] "I was a bit tired, but I must admit Mikhail played unbelievable tennis and deserved to win. There is nothing wrong with me." [...] As the 14th-seed at the Australian Open Youzhny reached his first quarterfinals there by defeating world number four Nikolay Davydenko in straight sets. However, in the quarterfinals he lost to unseeded Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, ranked world number thirty-eight and the eventual runner-up, in three sets. At the Open 13 in Marseille, France, Youzhny reached the quarterfinals, losing in straight sets to world number seventeen Marcos Baghdatis. At the Miami Masters, Youzhny was 4–5 down with Spain's Nicolás Almagro serving in the final set, he hit a relatively easy return into the net. <b>He</b> <b>gestured</b> angrily towards his own temple, and then hit his head strongly with the edge of frame of his tennis racket three times, drawing blood. Despite this—and after receiving medical attention—he won the next seven points, taking the tiebreaker and also the match. In his next match, he lost to Serbia's Janko Tipsarevic. His bad form continued into the clay season, but Youzhny, as the 15th-seed, managed to reach the third round of the French Open, losing to world number twenty-three Fernando Verdasco from Spain in four sets. At Wimbledon Youzhny was seeded 17th, and reached the fourth round by defeating 16th-seed Radek Štěpánek in a five-setter in the third round. He lost to 2nd-seed and eventual champion Rafael Nadal in the fourth round. At his next tournament, the Allianz Suisse Open Gstaad in Switzerland, Youzhny reached his last quarterfinals of the season and lost to Spain's Guillermo Garcia-Lopez. At the Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, Youzhny lost in the third round to world number three Novak Djokovic. Youzhny withdrew from the US Open due to viral illness, making his first withdrawal from a grand slam after appearing in 23 in a row. Youzhny continued his poor results, reaching the first and second round in all the remaining tournaments, with one exception in Tokyo, Japan. He ended the year with a 28–22 win-loss record, and with an end of year ranking of 33.|$|E

His face became clearer, and she saw with infinite concern that he winced at every stride.|$|E

A halo around his head, <b>he</b> <b>gestures</b> downward towards her, his face turned to the right seemingly emploring those around him, who together are rather motley. Clerics {{can be seen in}} their ceremonial robes to either side of Christ, while other spectators range from a Roman guard to a naked child. The marble arches of the building they are inhabiting fill the background...|$|R
5000|$|Amoghasiddhi is {{associated}} with the conceptual skandha or the conceptual mind (as opposed to the non-conceptual or sensational mind). His action towards the promotion of Buddhist paths is the pacification of evils. This is symbolised by Amoghasiddhi's symbol, the moon. <b>He</b> <b>gestures</b> in the mudra of fearlessness, symbolising his and his devotees' fearlessness towards the poisons or delusions. [...] He is usually coloured green in artwork and {{is associated}} with the air or wind element. His season is autumn and his heavenly quarter is the northern buddha-kṣetra called Prakuta.|$|R

60|$|St. Clare {{had started}} up, and, as his manner was when excited, was walking, with hurried steps, {{up and down}} the floor. His fine face, classic as that of a Greek statue, seemed {{actually}} to burn with the fervor of his feelings. His large blue eyes flashed, and <b>he</b> <b>gestured</b> with an unconscious eagerness. Miss Ophelia had never seen him in this mood before, and she sat perfectly silent.|$|E
6000|$|The {{three men}} stopped, and moved their heads {{as though they}} were looking about them. They turned their faces this way and that, and Nunez gesticulated with freedom. But they did not appear to see him for all his gestures, and after a time, {{directing}} themselves towards the mountains far away to the right, they shouted as if in answer. Nunez bawled again, and then once more, and as <b>he</b> <b>gestured</b> ineffectually the word [...] "blind" [...] came {{up to the top of}} his thoughts. [...] "The fools must be blind," [...] he said.|$|E

50|$|Sportswriter Bob Wolf of the Milwaukee Journal {{indicated}} that Mathews' {{election to the}} Baseball Hall of Fame may have been delayed because of his cool relationship with the media.
