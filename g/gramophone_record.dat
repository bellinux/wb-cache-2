5|$|In {{early modern}} coronations, the events inside the abbey were usually {{recorded}} by artists {{and published in}} elaborate folio books of engravings, the last of these was published in 1905 depicting the coronation which had taken place three years earlier.

In 1902, a request to record the ceremony on a <b>gramophone</b> <b>record</b> was rejected, but SirBenjamin Stone photographed the procession into the abbey.

5|$|The {{music of}} the video game Final Fantasy XIII was {{composed}} by Masashi Hamauzu. Former regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu did not contribute any pieces to the soundtrack.

25|$|The phonograph, {{record player}} or {{gramophone}} is {{an instrument for}} recording, reproducing and playing back sounds. The earliest phonographs used cylinders containing an audio recording engraved on the outside surface which could be reproduced when the cylinder was played.

The phonograph was invented in 1877 by Thomas Alva Edison at his laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey.

25|$|A further {{limitation}} of the <b>gramophone</b> <b>record</b> is that fidelity steadily declines as playback progresses; there is more vinyl per second available for fine reproduction of high frequencies at the large-diameter beginning of the groove than exist at the smaller-diameters {{close to the end}} of the side. At the start of a groove on an LP there are 510mm of vinyl per second traveling past the stylus while the ending of the groove gives 200–210mm of vinyl per second — less than half the linear resolution. Distortion towards the end of the side is likely to become more apparent as record wear increases.|$|E
25|$|Groove recordings, first {{designed}} in the final quarter of the 19th century, held a predominant position for nearly a century—withstanding competition from reel-to-reel tape, the 8-track cartridge, and the compact cassette. In 1988, the compact disc surpassed the <b>gramophone</b> <b>record</b> in unit sales. Vinyl records experienced a sudden decline in popularity between 1988 and 1991, when the major label distributors restricted their return policies, which retailers had been relying on to maintain and swap out stocks of relatively unpopular titles. First the distributors began charging retailers more for new product if they returned unsold vinyl, and then they stopped providing any credit at all for returns. Retailers, fearing they would be stuck with anything they ordered, only ordered proven, popular titles that they knew would sell, and devoted more shelf space to CDs and cassettes. Record companies also deleted many vinyl titles from production and distribution, further undermining {{the availability of the}} format and leading to the closure of pressing plants. This rapid decline in the availability of records accelerated the format's decline in popularity, and is seen by some as a deliberate ploy to make consumers switch to CDs, which were more profitable for the record companies.|$|E
