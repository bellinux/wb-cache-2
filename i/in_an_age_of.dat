5|$|Beginning in the mid-3rd {{century the}} {{emperors}} began to favor {{members of the}} equestrian order over senators, who had had a monopoly {{on the most important}} offices of state. Senators were stripped of the command of legions and most provincial governorships (as it was felt that they lacked the specialized military upbringing needed <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> acute defense needs), such posts being given to equestrians by Diocletian and his colleagues—following a practice enforced piecemeal by their predecessors. The emperors, however, still needed the talents and the help of the very rich, who were relied on to maintain social order and cohesion by means of a web of powerful influence and contacts at all levels. Exclusion of the old senatorial aristocracy threatened this arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Catherine {{believed}} in the humanist ideal of the learned Renaissance prince whose authority depended on letters as well as arms. She {{was inspired by the}} example of her father-in-law, King Francis I of France, who had hosted the leading artists of Europe at his court, and by her Medici ancestors. <b>In</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> civil war and declining respect for the monarchy, she sought to bolster royal prestige through lavish cultural display. Once in control of the royal purse, she launched a programme of artistic patronage that lasted for three decades. During this time, she presided over a distinctive late French Renaissance culture in all branches of the arts.|$|E

50|$|Robert E. Howard's Conan: Adventures <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>Age</b> Undreamed <b>Of,</b> {{or simply}} Conan: Adventures <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>Age</b> Undreamed <b>Of,</b> is <b>a</b> sword and sorcery British pen-and-paper {{role-playing}} game {{set in the}} world of Conan the Barbarian, the fictional Hyborian Age. Both the character and the setting were first imagined by American author Robert E. Howard (1906-1936) as of 1932 and until his suicide in 1936. Howard's original literary work has since spawned a vast franchise of novels, comic books, films, video games, board games, role-playing games, etc. Following this tradition, Conan: Adventures <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>Age</b> Undreamed <b>Of</b> is the third officially licensed Conan role-playing game. The two precedent games were Conan Role-Playing Game (1985-1988) and Conan: The Roleplaying Game (2004-2010), although there also had been supplements for independent generic systems, like GURPS Conan (1988-1989).|$|R
5|$|Catherine's {{three sons}} reigned <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> almost {{constant}} civil and religious war in France. The {{problems facing the}} monarchy were complex and daunting but Catherine {{was able to keep}} the monarchy and the state institutions functioning even at a minimum level. At first, Catherine compromised and made concessions to the rebelling Protestants, or Huguenots, as they became known. She failed, however, to grasp the theological issues that drove their movement. Later she resorted, in frustration and anger, to hard-line policies against them. In return, she came to be blamed for the excessive persecutions carried out under her sons' rule, in particular for the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572, in which thousands of Huguenots were killed in Paris and throughout France.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> {{classical}} Sanskrit literature, Madhava II (brother of King Vishnugopa) wrote a treatise Dattaka Sutravritti {{which was}} based on an earlier work on erotics by a writer called Dattaka. A Sanskrit version of Vaddakatha, a commentary on Pāṇini's grammar called Sabdavathara and a commentary on the 15th chapter of a Sanskrit work called Kiratarjunneya by poet Bharavi (who was in Durvinita's court) are ascribed to Durvinita. King Shivamara II is known to have written Gajamata Kalpana. Hemasena, also known as Vidya Dhananjaya authored Raghavapandaviya, a narration of the stories of Rama and the Pandavas simultaneously through puns. Gayachintamani and Kshatrachudamini which were based on poet Bana's work Kadambari were written by Hemasena's pupil Vadeebhasimha in prose style. and Chavundaraya wrote Charitarasara.|$|E
5|$|New Age thought {{typically}} envisions {{the world}} as developing through cosmological cycles which can be identified astrologically. It adopts this concept from Theosophy, although often presents it in a looser and more eclectic way than is found in Theosophical teaching. New Age literature often claims that humanity once lived <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> spiritual wisdom. In the writings of New Agers like Edgar Cayce, the ancient period of spiritual wisdom is associated with concepts of supremely-advanced societies living on lost continents such as Atlantis, Lemuria, and Mu, {{as well as the}} idea that ancient societies like those of Ancient Egypt were far more technologically advanced than modern scholarship accepts.|$|E

5|$|Samuel Adams {{was born}} in Boston in the British colony of Massachusetts on September 16, 1722, an Old Style date that is {{sometimes}} converted to the New Style date of September 27.

5|$|T.F. Tout, in 1914 one of {{the first}} historians to make a {{thorough}} academic study of the period, considered Pembroke the one favourable exception <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> small-minded and incompetent leaders. Tout wrote of a 'middle party', led by Pembroke, representing a moderate position between the extremes of Edward and Lancaster. This 'middle party' supposedly took control of royal government through the Treaty of Leake in 1318. In his authoritative study of 1972, J.R.S. Phillips rejects this view. In spite of misgivings with the King’s favourites, Pembroke was consistently loyal to Edward. What was accomplished in 1318 was not the takeover by a 'middle party', but simply a restoration of royal power.|$|E
5|$|The Texas oil boom, {{sometimes}} called the gusher age, {{was a period of}} dramatic change and economic growth in the U.S. state of Texas during the early 20th century that began with the discovery of a large petroleum reserve near Beaumont, Texas. The find was unprecedented in its size and ushered <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> rapid regional development and industrialization that has few parallels in U.S. history. Texas quickly became one of the leading oil producing states in the U.S., along with Oklahoma and California; soon the nation overtook the Russian Empire as the top producer of petroleum. By 1940 Texas had come to dominate U.S. production. Some historians even define the beginning of the world's Oil Age as the beginning of this era in Texas.|$|E

The crystallized form of aer, which is known as Apatheia, {{is considered to be a}} very powerful energy source as it is essential to human life. To protect towns from attacks by monsters, large amounts of Apatheia are being produced to create barriers around towns. One day, in a forest near the town of Shizontania, Yuri Lowell and Flynn Scifo, two knights who have just joined the Niren Corps, together with two of their senior knights and fellow Corps members, Hisca and Chastel, are sent on a mission to investigate an abnormal gushing of aer in the area.|$|E
5|$|In a short {{epilogue}} {{after the}} end of Legacy of the Void, Kerrigan calls for Artanis and Raynor's help to confront Amon inside the Void to defeat him once and for all. In the occasion, they meet Ouros, the last of the Xel'Naga who reveals that to confront Amon on equal terms, Kerrigan must inherit Ouros' essence and become a Xel'Naga herself, as Ouros himself is at the last of his strength. Assisted by the Zerg, Terran and Protoss forces, the empowered Kerrigan vanquishes Amon, before disappearing without a trace. Two years later, Kerrigan appears before Raynor in human form and he departs with her to never be heard from again, while the Zerg, the Terran and the Protoss civilizations begin to rebuild <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> peace and prosperity.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the {{north-western}} regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that {{were known as}} the mahajanapadas. The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira. Buddhism, based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling {{the life of the}} Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India. <b>In</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an ideal, and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Mauryan Empire. The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent excepting the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas. The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka's renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma.|$|E

Oshii chose to use the real streets of Hong Kong as his model. He also said that Hong Kong was the perfect subject and theme for the film with its countless signs and the cacophony of sounds. The film's mecha designer Takeuchi Atsushi noted that while the film does not have a chosen setting, it is obviously based on Hong Kong because the city represented the theme of the film, {{the old and the new}} which exist in a strange relationship <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> an information deluge.
