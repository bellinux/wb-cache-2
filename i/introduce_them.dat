5|$|In August, Breckinridge {{traveled}} to Virginia's Sweet Springs {{to improve his}} health. He visited family and friends while there, but the exact dates and locations he visited are not known. At some point, he obtained a draft of resolutions written by Vice President Thomas Jefferson denouncing the recently-enacted Alien and Sedition Acts. Jefferson wished to keep his authorship secret, and Breckinridge accepted credit for them during his life. In 1814, John Taylor revealed Jefferson's authorship; Breckinridge's grandson, John C. Breckinridge, wrote Jefferson for confirmation of Taylor's claims. Cautioning that {{the passage of time}} and his failing memory might cause him to inaccurately recount the details, Jefferson responded that he, Breckinridge, Wilson Nicholas, and possibly James Madison met at Monticello, at a date Jefferson could not recall, to discuss the need for resolutions denouncing the Alien and Sedition Acts. They decided that Jefferson would pen the resolutions and that Breckinridge would <b>introduce</b> <b>them</b> in the Kentucky legislature upon his return to that state.|$|E
5|$|In March 1954, Air Kruise {{applied for}} {{permission}} to operate Dakotas on routes between Lympne and Le Touquet, Calais and Ostend. On 29 April, the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation offered Lympne for sale by auction in London. Bidding reached £88,000 but the reserve was £100,000 and the airport was not sold. On 28 August, Silver City Airways trialled a Westland-Sikorsky WS-51 helicopter on cross-Channel flights. Permission had been granted {{for the use of}} these aircraft for freight operations and it was intended to <b>introduce</b> <b>them</b> on 1 April 1955. On 3 October, Silver City Airways operated their last flight out of Lympne as operations were being transferred to the new Lydd (Ferryfield) Airport which had opened on 6 July 1954. A total of 33,487 car ferry flights had been made from Lympne since the service had started in 1948. As of 1 November, Lympne closed as a public airport, although private flying was allowed as long as no passengers were carried for hire or reward.|$|E

5|$|Sandgrouse {{have little}} {{interaction}} with people, primarily because most species live in arid unpopulated areas and at low densities. They are not generally sought after as game birds {{as they are}} not especially palatable, although they have on occasion been taken in great numbers at water holes. An attempt to <b>introduce</b> <b>them</b> into Nevada failed {{but they have been}} introduced to Hawaii. No species is considered to be threatened although there have been some localised range contractions, particularly in Europe. A subspecies of the chestnut-bellied sandgrouse, P. e. floweri, was last seen in the Nile Valley of Egypt in 1979. It is thought to be extinct, but the reasons for this are unknown.|$|E
5|$|The royal {{pages were}} {{adolescent}} boys {{and young men}} conscripted from aristocratic households and serving the kings of Macedonia perhaps from the reign of PhilipII onward, although more solid evidence dates to the reign of Alexander the Great. Royal pages played no direct role in high politics and were conscripted {{as a means to}} <b>introduce</b> <b>them</b> to political life. After a period of training and service, pages were expected to become members of the king's companions and personal retinue. During their training, pages were expected to guard the king as he slept, supply him with horses, aid him in mounting his horse, accompany him on royal hunts, and serve him during symposia (i.e. formal drinking parties). Although there is little evidence for royal pages in the Antigonid period, it is known that some of them fled with Perseus of Macedon to Samothrace following his defeat by the Romans in 168BC.|$|E
5|$|Kate tells Erin about Rhys' plan, but he convinces Erin that Kate is {{a jealous}} ex-girlfriend who is lying. Erin {{believes}} {{him and they}} have dinner together. Rhys pours wine on her shirt sleeve and at the hospital, he implies to Karl that Erin has a drinking problem. She quits the surgical program and Rhys asks Jessica if he can take her place. Karl realises he has been used and Rhys takes him to visit Elaine, {{to try to make}} him understand what getting on the program means to him. Elaine reveals she has spinal degeneration and Karl remarks that Rhys cannot help her. Rhys explains that he wants to help the next person to develop the condition. Rhys sits an exam on the material he has missed and Jessica allows him join the surgical program. Rhys makes a bet with Kate that he can seduce Jade, but when he goes to kiss her, Jade rejects him. Rhys' mother asks if she can visit him and Rhys tells her he is working over Easter. When they run into Jade and Kyle, Rhys does not <b>introduce</b> <b>them</b> to Elaine and she accuses him of being ashamed of her. Rhys then takes Elaine to meet Martin, who reveals he failed his surgical program interview. Elaine accuses him of lying to her and being like his father. Rhys denies this and Elaine tells him to fix things with the people he has hurt.|$|E

5|$|The royal {{pages were}} {{adolescent}} boys {{and young men}} conscripted from aristocratic households and serving the kings of Macedonia perhaps from the reign of Philip II onward, although more solid evidence for {{their presence in the}} royal court dates to the reign of Alexander the Great. Royal pages played no direct role in high politics and were conscripted as a means to <b>introduce</b> <b>them</b> to political life. After a period of training and service, pages were expected to become members of the king's companions and personal retinue. During their training, pages were expected to guard the king as he slept, supply him with horses, aid him in mounting his horse, accompany him on royal hunts, and serve him during symposia (i.e. formal drinking parties). While conscripted pages would have looked forward to a lifelong career at court or even a prestigious post as a governor, they can also be regarded as hostages held by the royal court in order to ensure the loyalty and obedience of their aristocratic fathers. The abusive punishment of pages, such as flogging, carried out by the king at times, led to intrigue and conspiracy against the Crown, as did the frequent homosexual relations between the pages and the elite, sometimes with the king. Although there is little evidence for royal pages throughout the Antigonid period, it is known that a group of them fled with Perseus of Macedon to Samothrace following his defeat by the Romans in 168 BC.|$|E

Subsequent reviews may take place depending upon emphases, including both junior and senior level reviews.|$|E

25|$|There {{is always}} a risk that outsiders and {{undercover}} policemen might masquerade as a mafioso to infiltrate the organization. To ensure that this does not happen, a mafioso must never introduce himself to another mafioso whom he does not personally know, even if he knows the other through reputation. If he wants to establish a relationship, he must ask a third mafioso whom they both personally know to <b>introduce</b> <b>them</b> {{to each other in}} a face-to-face meeting. This intermediary can vouch that neither of the two is an impostor.|$|E
25|$|Gove's {{views on}} exam systems became clear in December 2014 {{after the release}} of archive papers from 1986.

However opposition to the new exams from the teaching unions persuaded her to <b>introduce</b> <b>them</b> immediately, purely so as not to appear weak. Although Gove had sought but failed to replace them, his special advisor, Dominic Cummings, described the 1986 decision as catastrophic, leading to a collapse in the integrity of the exam system.|$|E
