5|$|Digestive tract telangiectasias may be {{identified}} on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (endoscopy of the esophagus, stomach and {{first part of}} the small intestine). This procedure will typically only be undertaken if there is anemia that is more marked than expected by the severity of nosebleeds, or if there is evidence of severe bleeding (vomiting blood, black stools). If the number of lesions seen on endoscopy is unexpectedly low, the remainder of the small intestine may be examined with capsule endoscopy, in which the patient swallows a capsule-shaped device containing a miniature camera which transmits images of the digestive tract to a portable <b>digital</b> <b>recorder.</b>|$|E
5|$|Of Human Feelings was {{recorded}} with a Sony PCM-1600 two-track <b>digital</b> <b>recorder,</b> a rare item at the time. According to journalist Howard Mandel, the passages {{played by the}} band sounded neither very soft or loud on the album, {{because it had been}} mixed with a middle-frequency range and compressed dynamics. Because of the equipment used, Coleman did not embellish the album with added effects and avoided overdubbing, multi-tracking, and remixing. According to him, Of Human Feelings was the first jazz album to be digitally recorded in the United States.|$|E

500|$|Wilco {{decided to}} use concerts from their {{hometown}} of Chicago [...] "because [...] wanted to be really comfortable". They chose a string of four consecutive shows from May 4 to May 7, 2005 at The Vic Theater in Chicago, Illinois. The band recorded the four shows on a 24-track <b>digital</b> <b>recorder.</b> The shows were filmed for a potential DVD release, but the band decided not to release the footage. According to Tweedy, the band was disappointed by how the footage [...] "sapped" [...] the energy out of the performances. On September 13, 2005, the band announced that the album would be released on November 1, 2005. The release date was later delayed two weeks.|$|E
500|$|A Momentary Lapse of Reason was {{recorded}} in several different studios, mainly Gilmour's houseboat studio Astoria moored on the Thames; according to Ezrin, [...] "working there was just magical, so inspirational; kids sculling down the river, geese flying by..." [...] Andy Jackson, a colleague of Floyd cohort James Guthrie, {{was brought in to}} engineer the recordings. During sessions held between November 1986 and February 1987, Gilmour's band worked on new material, which in a marked change from previous Floyd albums {{was recorded}} with a 24-track analogue machine, and overdubbed onto a 32-track Mitsubishi <b>digital</b> <b>recorder.</b> This trend of using new technologies was continued with the use of MIDI synchronisation, aided by an Apple Macintosh computer.|$|E
500|$|Daniel Robson of The Japan Times {{described}} Supercell's {{music as}} [...] "sentimental J-pop... also explores the genre's jazzier, spunkier and dancier elements." [...] Their sound {{has been compared}} to pop singers Aiko and Yui, and Ryo has stated himself that he likes expressing human emotions in his music. When creating a song, Ryo has often hummed a tune into a <b>digital</b> <b>recorder,</b> or starts by playing the piano. While it depends on the song, Ryo has stated he generally [...] "play the piano and take notes of the chord progression" [...] and then writes the lyrics. Ryo has cited [...] "artists that blend rock and hip-hop styles with today's latest technology" [...] as influencing his music, including: Massive Attack, Boom Boom Satellites, Portishead, Tricky, and Unkle.|$|E

500|$|Caribbean Sound Basin's main studio {{had both}} analog and digital equipment, a 60ft x 70ft x 18ft live room, and three {{isolation}} booths, for vocals, piano, and drums. The group recorded original tracks using Studer 24- and 48-track recorders and transferred {{them to a}} Sony <b>digital</b> <b>recorder.</b> For most songs, MIDI keyboards were played live into a sequencer and left unquantized, while vintage keyboards were recorded to analog tape. Riley said of the process in an interview for Keyboard magazine, [...] "even though we used a sequencer for some stuff, we'd still cut the song live from start to finish. See, the last record was all done with a Synclavier. But this time, we tried to keep it all live and raw." ...|$|E
500|$|Vig {{had created}} {{a new version of}} their song [...] "Bad Boyfriend", which had opened their Bleed Like Me album, when he had been {{updating}} his home studio the previous year. Keeping to the Garbage formula of incorporating non-musical sounds in their work, Vig used a <b>digital</b> <b>recorder</b> to capture the sound of his baby daughter's swing in motion as a percussive loop. Thinking that the compilation would benefit from the inclusion of a new remix, Vig presented his rework to Manson and Erikson who had been unaware of the new version. Both agreed that [...] "Bad Boyfriend" [...] should be included, but rather than solicit an outside producer, Vig spent a few days finishing the mix. Inversely, Garbage recruited production team Jeremy Wheatley and Brio Tellefario to create a new version of Bleed Like Me track [...] "It's All Over but the Crying"; the band hoped the song would be a possible second single. A rock version of Version 2.0s [...] "Push It" [...] was completed by producer Chris Sheldon.|$|E
500|$|When filming The Bill, some {{scenes were}} re-enacted indoors with {{microphones}} surrounding {{the actors and}} the extra sounds being [...] "dubbed" [...] on later. [...] Some of the more aggressive scenes were also filmed indoors either for dubbing or safety reasons. When filming scenes involving police cars, a camera {{was attached to the}} outside of the car which feeds back images to a <b>digital</b> <b>recorder</b> {{in the back of the}} vehicle. [...] This technique was used to film the new opening titles of The Bill. The sirens used in the series were added later in the dubbing suite as The Bill did not have permission to use sirens while on location. However, the police uniforms used in the series were genuine, again making The Bill unique amongst police dramas. When the series ended, London's Metropolitan Police Service, after talks with the production company, bought 400 kilograms of police-related paraphernalia, including flat caps and stab vests etc. to prevent them falling into the hands of criminals or those who would seek to use them for criminal activities after the programme's production ceased.|$|E

500|$|... "Dazzling Blue" [...] {{is based}} on his {{relationship}} with wife Edie Brickell, and the title references her favorite color. [...] "The CAT scan's eye sees what the heart's concealing", sang Simon over African cadences and Indian tablas, before marvelling at how his wife and he [...] "were born beneath a star of dazzling blue". He said the song {{reminded him of his}} work as a part of Simon & Garfunkel. [...] "Rewrite" [...] features segments of recordings made on a small <b>digital</b> <b>recorder</b> by Brickell on a 2009 family trip together in Kenya. Simon was frustrated over the guitar tone in his song and attached the sound of a wildebeest to a certain guitar note each time it occurred, in an effort to create an interesting sound. The song contains nighttime ambience recorded during the trip. It was written about a burned out Vietnam veteran imagining that he could rewrite his life, in order to give it a happy ending. [...] "Love and Hard Times" [...] is an affirmation of love for Brickell. The beginning of the song references “God and his only son” visiting Earth. Simon noted that the song’s thesis is being thankful at the highest level. The track contains orchestral arrangement from Gil Goldstein, which was recorded at Avatar Studios, as Ramone wanted a larger room to record in.|$|E

[...] and the music of Godzilla composer Akira Ifukube have been noted, and it has been suggested that Giacchino's overture is a tribute to Ifukube's work, which was confirmed by Matt Reeves in the DVD's commentary track. The sound track was supervised by William Files and Douglas Murray at Skywalker Sound.|$|E
