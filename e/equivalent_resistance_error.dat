40|$|Although {{the flow}} {{resistance}} {{of a single}} vessel segment is easy to compute, the <b>equivalent</b> <b>resistance</b> {{of a network of}} vessel segments or the entire vasculature of an organ is difficult to determine in an analytic form. Here, we propose what we believe is a novel resistance scaling law for a vascular tree (i. e., the resistance of a vessel segment scales with the <b>equivalent</b> <b>resistance</b> of the corresponding distal tree). The formulation can be written as (Rs/Rc) ∝(Ls/Lc) (where Rs and Ls are the resistance and length of a vessel segment, respectively, and Rc and Lc are the <b>equivalent</b> <b>resistance</b> and total length of the corresponding distal tree, respectively), which was validated for the coronary vascular systems of the heart. The scaling law was also shown to apply to the vascular systems of the lung, mesentery, muscle, eye, and so on. The novel resistance scaling law, coupled with the 3 / 4 -power scaling law for metabolic rates, can predict several structure-function relations of vascular trees, albeit with a different exponent. In particular, the self-similar nature of the scaling law may serve as a diagnostic tool with the help of noninvasive imaging modalities...|$|R

The numerical method is applied to analyze the variation of <b>equivalent</b> <b>resistance</b> and <b>equivalent</b> reactance when dry-type air-core reactor winding short circuit happens in different places，and the monitoring method based on harmonic analysis method and quasi- synchronization sampling method is analyzed by theory.
