25|$|The tales vary widely: {{they include}} {{historical}} tales, love stories, tragedies, comedies, poems, burlesques, and {{various forms of}} erotica. Numerous stories depict jinns, ghouls, apes, sorcerers, magicians, and legendary places, which are often intermingled with real people and geography, not always rationally. Common protagonists include the historical Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid, his Grand Vizier, Jafar al-Barmaki, and the famous poet Abu Nuwas, {{despite the fact that}} these figures lived some 200 years {{after the fall of the}} Sassanid Empire, in which the frame tale of Scheherazade is set. Sometimes a character in Scheherazade's tale will begin telling other characters a story of his own, and that story may <b>have</b> <b>another</b> <b>one</b> told within it, resulting in a richly layered narrative texture.|$|E
500|$|Director Phillip Noyce was {{optimistic about}} a sequel, saying [...] "Hopefully {{within a couple}} of years, we'll <b>have</b> <b>another</b> <b>one.</b> Angelina's so great in this part. When audiences see the movie they're going to feel like it's only just the beginning." [...] Producer Lorenzo DiBonaventura also {{expressed}} further interest: [...] "Angie, I know, loved that character, and would love to explore the character some more first and foremost." ...|$|E
500|$|The first {{prototype}} development began in 1925. [...] Produced in the Trubia Artillery Factory (Fábrica de Artillería Trubia), in Asturias, the tank was {{powered by a}} four-cylinder Hispano-Suiza 40/50 engine, the same engine the Spanish Army's military trucks had been equipped with since 1915. Given the Spanish Army's opinion that the FT was limited in firepower, the Trubia tank featured a special turret. The turret was designed in two articulated halves, which could traverse independently, each armed with a machine gun. Theoretically, {{if one of the}} machine guns jammed, the tank would still <b>have</b> <b>another</b> <b>one</b> to defend itself with. Furthermore, the vehicle's hull was provided with firing ports, to allow the crew to fire from within the tank. [...] This prototype was put through a series of tests, and its success brought about the decision to continue development on a Spanish tank, leading to an improved Trubia tank design, known as the Modelo Trubia 75HP, tipo rápido, serie A (Model Trubia 75hp, fast tank, series A).|$|E

2500|$|The Braves {{earned their}} fourth win {{of the season}} against former Braves pitcher Alex Wood and the Los Angeles Dodgers in a {{lopsided}} 8–1 game at Turner Field. Wood said after the game that it [...] "was not really the way I pictured coming back {{here for the first}} time. Fastball command was the most frustrating thing. I don't even know if I've walked in a run before in my professional career. The walks were pretty frustrating. It was a tough one to swallow, but I <b>have</b> <b>another</b> <b>one</b> in five days." [...] Despite a 3-1 lead, the Dodgers scored four unanswered runs to snap the Braves four-game win streak. A Yasmani Grandal double in the 10th inning gave the Dodgers a 2–1 victory in the Braves's fourth extra-inning game of the season.|$|E
2500|$|The {{follow-up}} album Rocket Cottage (1976), {{also produced}} by Batt, {{proved to be}} a commercial flop, despite having much in common musically with its immediate predecessor. The opening track, [...] "London", was penned by Rick Kemp as a follow-up to [...] "All Around My Hat", in response to a request from the record label that Kemp describes as [...] "we'll <b>have</b> <b>another</b> <b>one</b> of those, please", and released as a single. The song failed to make the UK Chart, in complete contrast to [...] "All Around My Hat", despite having much in common with its predecessor – a 12/8 time signature, upbeat tempo, solo verses and full harmony chorus. Rocket Cottage also included experimental tracks [...] "Fighting for Strangers" [...] (with sparse vocals singing concurrently in a variety of keys) and, on the final track, excerpts of studio banter between the band members and a seemingly impromptu rendition of [...] "Camptown Races", in which Prior gets the lyrics wrong.|$|E

It did not seem to me that it would have acted as he told me, and I asked him to <b>have</b> <b>another</b> <b>one</b> made so that I might understand how it was worked, for such a contrivance would be extremely useful in escalades, when the troops, after descending into a deep fosse, need the rope for climbing a wall or bastion. There it is, gentlemen, and as you see, by pulling this thin cord the hook is lifted from its hold, and the slightest shake will bring it down.|$|E
