Bovine {{serum albumin}} (BSA) and human serum albumin (HSA) {{interaction}} with 4 -nitroaniline were investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy respectively. 4 -Nitroaniline can strongly quench intrinsic fluorescence of BSA and HSA. 4 -Nitroaniline exhibits a high affinity to bovine and human serum albumins. The binding constants K {{and the number}} binding site n were obtained by <b>double-log</b> <b>regression</b> equation. Negative enthalpy (ΔH) and positive entropy (ΔS) values indicated that both hydrogen bond and hydrophobic forces {{played a major role}} in the binding of 4 -nitroaniline and SA. The results of synchronous fluorescence showed the polarity around tryptophan residues was decreased and the hydrophobicity was increased...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of  the  study  is  {{to analyze}} demand elasticity for strategic foods  during {{economic crisis and}} its  implication  on  food and  nutrient consumption among  household  in Indonesia.   This ecological study was  conducted  to  14, 767   households  owned  children  less  than  two  years  included  in  National Socioeconomic  Survey  2007.   Analysis  was  conducted  by  using  econometric  model  of  <b>Double-Log</b> <b>Regression</b> in SAS program. Result of analysis showed that the own-price elasticities were all found to be negative  as  expected,  meaning  that  increased  price  of  strategic  food  tended  to  reduce  its  demand.   In conclusion, the effect of  food crisis was visible {{to most of the}} strategic foods   which their demand tended to be highly affected by price changes. This effect was mostly seen in rural and low income household s which  had  limited  income  to  purchase  food.   Improved  income  tended  to  increase  demand  of  strategic foods.

40|$|Analysis of the Determinants of Households'Fish Demand in Burkina Faso: the Case of a Rural Area (Vallée du Kou) and Urban Areas (Bobo-Dioulasso and Ouagadougou). A {{study was}} {{conducted}} in 2004 in Burkina Faso in order to analyze the determinants of households' fish demand in both rural (Vallée du Kou) and urban (Bobo-Dioulasso and Ouagadougou) areas. To achieve this objective, 535 households were surveyed, the data collected were analyzed and a <b>double-log</b> <b>regression</b> function was constructed. The results of this study showed that households' fish consumption varied considerably according to the area (rural or urban). Households' fish demand was influenced by the availability of the product in the market. In addition to that, when the fish supply frequency increased, the duration of the conservation of the product was reduced or was annulled. The study revealed that the determinants of fish demand in rural area in Vallée du Kou included the size of the household, the prize of the fish in the market, the level of education and the revenue of the head of the household. In urban areas, these determinants include mainly the revenue of the head of the household, fish supply frequency, and conservation methods of the product...|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{electricity}} demand in Java-Madura-Bali, Indonesia, {{must be addressed}} appropriately to avoid blackout by determining accurate peak load forecasting. Econometric approach may {{not be sufficient to}} handle this problem due to limitation in modelling nonlinear interaction of factors involved. To overcome this problem, Elman and Jordan Recurrent Neural Network based on Levenberg-Marquardt learning algorithm is proposed to forecast annual peak load of Java-Madura-Bali interconnection for 2009 - 2011. Actual historical regional data which consists of economic, electricity statistic and weather during 1995 - 2008 are applied as inputs. The networks structure is firstly justified using true historical data of 1995 - 2005 to forecast peak load of 2006 - 2008. Afterwards, peak load forecasting of 2009 - 2011 is conducted subsequently using actual historical data of 1995 - 2008. Overall, the proposed networks shown better performance compared to that obtained by Levenberg-Marquardt-Feedforward network, <b>Double-log</b> Multiple <b>Regression,</b> and with projection by PLN for 2006 - 2010...|$|R

Employing <b>double-log</b> linier multiple <b>regression</b> {{it was found that}} households demand for water from PDAM Kota Surakarta was influenced by the price of water from PDAM Kota Surakarta, the price of distillate water, the households income and number of households family members. Also {{it was found that the}} relationship between water from PDAM Kota Surakarta with distillate water is substitution. The positive cross price elasticity indicated the substitution. The households income elasticity, the dominance of households income and the positive relation between number of households family members and households demand for water from PDAM Kota Surakarta, however, indicated the complementary relationship between water from PDAM with distillate water...|$|R
40|$|In an open market, {{the land}} {{price of a}} {{particular}} site represents a set of attributes that a user {{is willing to pay}} for the use of that site. It has long been established {{that one of the most}} important attributes is the distance of this site from the city center. Based on a mono-centric assumption of urban development, land economists since Alonso have almost all agreed that there is a diminishing effect on land price the greater the distance from the city center. Although there have been various modifications of this locational perspective, it remains the core concept of land market dynamics. The question arises, therefore, as to whether a semi-open but extremely active land market with a heavy government presence will also follow this urban structure principle. In this paper, we apply a <b>double-log</b> <b>regression</b> model to examine land price changes in Shanghai from 1992 to 2006. Our results, based on an examination of more than seven thousand transactions, show that land price changes in Shanghai follow these dynamics and that a major transportation node plays an important role. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. postprin...|$|E
40|$|This {{study focused}} {{on the impact of}} {{vegetable}} sales on household income of hawkers in the Limpopo province. A stratified sampling technique was used. The population of hawkers was selected from the five district municipalities of the province. Three major towns from each district were randomly selected for 366 questionnaire administration. Multiple regression analysis (linear, semi-log and double-log) was used to determine the impact of vegetable sales on the household income of hawkers. The outcome of the study revealed that, nine independent variables {{had a significant impact on}} the vegetable sales of hawkers when the linear regression model was applied. On application of the semi-log regression, 11 independent variables had a significant impact on the vegetable sales. Ten independent variables had a significant impact on vegetable sales when considering the <b>double-log</b> <b>regression.</b> The cross tabulation of total sales according to districts showed that an average of 1. 6 respondents earned less than R 200 which is close to, but lower than R 174 which is the poverty line measure in South Africa. The study showed the degree of significance of different variables that have an impact on hawkers’ vegetable sales. Vegetable hawkers generate enough income from their sales to live above the poverty line. The recommendation was that the local municipalities should build new markets and improve the infrastructure of existing markets, and also provide proper sanitation and clean water to avoid unhygienic situations in hawkers’ markets.

40|$|The {{empirical}} estimations {{were based}} on linear and <b>double-log</b> <b>regression</b> models, which identified the factors influencing the average per capita brandy demand in Armenia. The model was estimated using quarterly time-series data on per capita brandy consumption, disposable income, prices of various alcoholic beverages for 1997 – 2015 periods. This is quantitative study based on secondary annual, quarterly and monthly data, and 5 % significance level. The average annual per capita brandy consumption data for 1997 – 2007 periods was obtained from WHO's website, whereas the 2008 – 2015 data was extracted from the National Statistical Service of the Republic of Armenia. For annual, quarterly and monthly periods from 1997 through 2015, the price data related to various alcoholic beverages, consumer price index were provided in NSS statistical publications of “Socio-Economic Situation of RA”, ”Consumer price indexes (prices) in the Republic of Armenia”, “Prices and tariffs in the Republic of Armenia”. For 1997 – 2015 periods, the average monthly per capita monetary income data was obtained from “Living Standards of Population and Social Sphere” section of statistical yearbooks. The latter substituted the average per capita monthly disposable income data, since these data were unavailable. Meantime, since the data included numerous years, therefore, the nominal price and income data were adjusted for inflation using consumer price index with 2005 as base year. In conclusion, the average real prices of wine and vodka were statistically significant determinants of the average per capita brandy demand in Armenia, {{and the demand for}} brandy was inelastic...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{develop and}} {{evaluate}} {{a program for}} laparoscopic urologic skills (PLUS) to determine the face, content, and construct validation to achieve uniformity and standardization in training residents in urology. METHODS: The PLUS consists of 5 basic laparoscopic tasks. Three tasks were abstracted from the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery program, and 2 additional tasks were developed under continuous evaluation by expert urologists. Fifty participants were recruited from different hospitals and performed the final PLUS training. They all completed a questionnaire after performance. Three outcome parameters were measured: performance quality, time, and dropped objects. The relationship between laparoscopic experience and the outcome parameters was investigated. RESULTS: Of the 50 participants, 13 were students, 20 were residents, and 17 were urologists. <b>Double-log</b> linear <b>regression</b> analysis for all 5 tasks showed a significant effect (effect size range 0. 53 - 0. 82; P <. 0005) for laparoscopic experience on performance time. Substantial correlations were found between experience and quality ratings (log-linear regression effect size 0. 37; P =. 012) {{and the number of}} dropped objects (Spearman correlation effect size 0. 49; P <. 01). The usefulness of the PLUS model as a training tool for basic laparoscopic skills was rated 4. 55 on a scale from 1 (not useful) to 5 (useful) (standard deviation 0. 58; range 3 - 5). CONCLUSION: The {{results of the present study}} indicated the face, content, and construct validity for the PLUS. The training is considered appropriate for use as a primary training tool for an entry test or as part of a step-wise training program in which basic and procedural laparoscopic skills are integrated...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{a set of}} <b>double-log</b> {{multiple}} <b>regression</b> {{models is}} developed to examine the monthly tunnel traffic of six major toll tunnels in Hong Kong for a 22 -year period from January 1979 to September 2000. Despite the much lower percentage of households with cars (12. 3 %) and the higher dependence of passenger trips on public transport (80. 2 %), the estimated automobile elasticities in Hong Kong are remarkably similar to those reported in New York, where car ownership is high and the automobile is the dominant mode of transport. The empirical elasticity range in Hong Kong is from - 0. 103 to - 0. 291. This is similar to estimates for the United States (- 0. 13 to - 0. 45), the United Kingdom (- 0. 14 to - 0. 36), and Australia (- 0. 09 to - 0. 52). The findings suggest that toll increases {{are likely to be}} effective in raising revenue for tunnel management authorities but ineffective in reducing or reallocating automobile traffic for transport planning purposes. Policywise, suburbanization or the redistribution of population could have a much stronger influence on the urban transport market than a 'multifaceted pricing' strategy of raising the total costs of vehicle ownership and usage (including high vehicle-registration fees, parking, and gasoline prices). Moreover, improvements to railway connectivity and enhancement of travel speed on public transit could be much more effective than toll increases in relieving urban transport congestion problems at critical bottlenecks, such as downtown and suburb - downtown tunnels and bridges. The inclusion of lagged effects into the analysis further strengthens the above policy recommendations. ...|$|R

The objectives of the research were to: (i) explore the availability of ICT infrastructure for health in China; and (ii) develop an approach for Consumer-centered eHealth (CeH) Technology adoption to solve those problems. The approach to evaluating the ICT infrastructure in China involved examining variables of school enrolment, per capita income and governance variables {{on the number of}} PCs, fixed telephones, mobile phone subscribers and Internet users. These were evaluated using a <b>double-log</b> <b>regression</b> model and cross-sectional data on various provinces in China. The analysis was based on 31 of the 34 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities that comprise Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. There were a number of main findings: (i) medical literacy and the number of Internet users had a statistically significant positive relationship with the number of PCs in each province; (ii) the combined school enrolment rate and per capita income had a statistically significant direct relationship with the number of fixed telephones and mobile phone subscribers; (iii) the combined school enrolment ratio and the number of fixed telephones had a statistically significant positive relationship with Internet usage; (iv) there were major inequalities in ICT connectivity between upper-middle, lower-middle and low income provinces in China; and (v) the information quality had statistically significant positive effect on all determinants. In order to improve access to health care, especially for remote rural areas and for the elderly in China, there is need to boost the availability and utilization of eHealth services.

40|$|An {{attempt is}} made in the present to provide an {{empirical}} content to differential coefficient of tax [revenue] buoyancy during post tax reform period in India by fitting a <b>double-log</b> <b>regression</b> model with an interaction variable to the stationary time series data based on Augmented - Dicky Fuller [ADF] and Phillips-Parron [PP] Tests. The period after 1992 is considered as post tax reform period to look at the prognostications of tax reforms that had been initiated by the government of India. The regression results illustrate that the estimate of constant gross tax buoyancy is positively significant and more than unity during pre tax reform period illuminating that gross tax is moderately elastic. From this upshot it can be comprehended that a one percent increase in income leads to increase the gross tax revenue by more than one percent, all else equal. Further it can be understood that the average propensity to tax [ratio of Gross Tax Revenue to Gross Domestic Product] was increasing with the increase in Gross Domestic Product during pre tax reform period. The regression coefficient of interaction variable is significantly negative and stumpy showing a downward shift in the degree of tax buoyancy during post tax reform period. The estimate of the tax buoyancy, which was just above the unity during pre tax reform period, is less than unity during post tax reform period evincing the fact that the gross Tax is relatively inelastic. From this it can also be understood that the average propensity to tax is declining with the increase in Gross Domestic Product during post tax reform period. Thus the estimates of gross tax buoyancy during pre and post tax reform periods are not stable. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{implementation}} of the 58 th World Health Assembly resolution on e-health will pose a major challenge for the Member States of the World Health Organization (WHO) African Region {{due to lack of}} information and communications technology (ICT) and mass Internet connectivity, compounded by a paucity of ICT-related knowledge and skills. The key objectives of this article are to: (i) explore the key determinants of personal computers (PCs), telephone mainline and cellular and Internet penetration/connectivity in the African Region; and (ii) to propose actions needed to create an enabling environment for e-health services growth and utilization in the Region. Methods The effects of school enrolment, per capita income and governance variables on the number of PCs, telephone mainlines, cellular phone subscribers and Internet users were estimated using a <b>double-log</b> <b>regression</b> model and cross-sectional data on various Member States in the African Region. The analysis was based on 45 of the 46 countries that comprise the Region. The data were obtained from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the World Bank and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) sources. Results There were a number of main findings: (i) the adult literacy and total number of Internet users had a statistically significant (at 5 % level in a t-distribution test) positive effect on the number of PCs in a country; (ii) the combined school enrolment rate and per capita income had a statistically significant direct effect on the number of telephone mainlines and cellular telephone subscribers; (iii) the regulatory quality had statistically significant negative effect on the number of telephone mainlines; (iv) similarly, the combined school enrolment ratio and the number of telephone mainlines had a statistically significant positive relationship with Internet usage; and (v) there were major inequalities in ICT connectivity between upper-middle, lower-middle and low income countries in the Region. By focusing on the adoption of specific technologies we attempted to interpret correlates in terms of relationships instead of absolute "causals". Conclusion In order to improve access to health care, especially for the majority of Africans living in remote rural areas, there is need to boost the availability and utilization of e-health services. Thus, universal access to e-health ought to be a vision for all countries in the African Region. Each country ought to develop a road map in a strategic e-health plan that will, over time, enable its citizens to realize that vision. </p...|$|E
