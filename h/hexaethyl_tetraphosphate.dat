50|$|Tetraethyl dithiopyrophosphate is {{produced}} {{in a manner similar}} to <b>hexaethyl</b> <b>tetraphosphate.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Hexaethyl</b> <b>tetraphosphate</b> in a pure {{state does}} not noticeably corrode metals such as brass and iron. However, when {{a small amount of}} water is added to the chemical, it forms a strong acid and quickly corrodes {{galvanized}} iron and more slowly corrodes pure iron. <b>Hexaethyl</b> <b>tetraphosphate</b> diluted with 0.1% water has a pH of 2.5.|$|E
50|$|The {{effects of}} <b>hexaethyl</b> <b>tetraphosphate</b> on the cholinesterase of rat and {{cockroach}} tissue have been tested.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hexaethyl</b> <b>tetraphosphate's</b> U.N. Shipping Number is 1611.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hexaethyl</b> <b>tetraphosphate</b> has a pH of 5.5. Its {{index of}} {{refraction}} is 1.443. The chemical boils at 467.01 C at a pressure of 760 millimeters of mercury and its flash point is 249.48 F. Its melting point is -40 C. It has a density of 1.331 grams per cubic centimeter. Its enthalpy of vaporization is 70.102 kilojoules per mole. <b>Hexaethyl</b> <b>tetraphosphate</b> has two Rule of 5 violations.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hexaethyl</b> <b>tetraphosphate</b> {{was first}} {{synthesised}} by the German chemist Gerhard Schrader, who reacted phosphorus oxychloride and triethyl orthophosphate at approximately 150 °C. This reaction {{is known as}} the Schrader process. The Germans also made <b>hexaethyl</b> <b>tetraphosphate</b> by phosphorus oxychloride and ethyl alcohol. This reaction requires slightly lower pressure than the Schrader process. The reaction has a chemical equation of POCl3 + 3(C2H5)3PO4 → (C2H5)6P4O13 + 3C2H5Cl.|$|E
50|$|The LD50 of <b>hexaethyl</b> <b>tetraphosphate</b> for thrips is 0.01%. 99% of aphids can {{be killed}} by a {{concentration}} of 1 to 2.5 grams of a 10% solution of the chemical in a 1000 cubic foot area. In one experiment, 100% of melon aphids were killed after exposure to an aqueous solution containing 0.025% <b>hexaethyl</b> <b>tetraphosphate</b> and 0.025% sodium lauryl sulfate. 99% of aphids can {{be killed by}} 0.3 grams of a 10% solution of the chemical in methyl chloride in 1000 cubic feet, and 100% of aphids can be killed by twice the amount of solution. 96% of apple aphids can be killed be exposure to an aqueous solution of 0.1% <b>hexaethyl</b> <b>tetraphosphate</b> and 0.05% sodium lauryl sulfate. Dust containing 3% <b>hexaethyl</b> <b>tetraphosphate</b> at a concentration of 40 pounds per acre can kill some bean aphids. 100% of cabbage aphids can be killed by an aqueous solution of 0.1% of the chemical and 0.05% sodium lauryl sulfate. Cabbage aphids can be quickly killed by a spray containing one pint of the chemical per 100 gallons of water.|$|E
50|$|Out of 133 {{plant species}} that were tested for a {{reaction}} to <b>hexaethyl</b> <b>tetraphosphate,</b> only two types of plants were negatively affected. These were chrysanthemums and tomatoes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hexaethyl</b> <b>tetraphosphate</b> {{can give}} off fumes that are toxic or {{corrosive}} {{if it is}} heated. Runoff containing the chemical {{can also lead to}} the pollution of waterways. Containers of it can also explode at high temperatures. If inhaled, swallowed, or absorbed via the skin, it can cause death. Mites, aphids, thrips, leafhoppers, and some types of caterpillars are highly susceptible to being poisoned by <b>hexaethyl</b> <b>tetraphosphate.</b> The chemical's toxicity to insects is not affected by whether it is made by the Scrader process or the Woodstock process. It is also very toxic to humans.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hexaethyl</b> <b>tetraphosphate</b> {{does not}} readily burn. It is {{miscible}} and soluble in water. It is also soluble {{in a large}} number of organic compounds. These include acetone, ether, alcohol, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, ethyl acetate, glycerol, benzene, diacetone alcohol, alkylated naphthalenes, xylene, and toluene. However, the chemical does not dissolve in kerosene, ligroin, or other paraffin fractions. When reacting with hydrides and other strong reducing agents, the chemical reacts to form phosphine, a toxic gas. When <b>hexaethyl</b> <b>tetraphosphate</b> is exposed to moisture, it quickly hydrolyzes. This reaction forms nontoxic products.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hexaethyl</b> <b>tetraphosphate</b> {{is used as}} an {{insecticide}}, in particular, the insecticide Bladan. The Germans {{commonly used}} this chemical as an insecticide during World War II, when nicotine-based insecticides were not available.|$|E
5000|$|... 100% of {{chrysanthemum}} aphids can {{be killed}} by an aqueous solution of 0.1% <b>hexaethyl</b> <b>tetraphosphate</b> and 0.05% sodium lauryl sulfate. 97% of chrysanthemum aphids can {{be killed by}} 3 grams of a 10% solution of the chemical in 1000 cubic feet. 100% of helianthus aphids can be killed by an aqueous solution containing 0.05% each of <b>hexaethyl</b> <b>tetraphosphate</b> and sodium lauryl sulfate. 94% of pea aphids can be killed by exposure for 24 hours to an emulsion containing a concentration of 2.4% of the chemical. 90% of potato aphids can be killed by exposure for 42 hours to a one pint of a 50% solution of the chemical in 100 gallons of water.|$|E
50|$|By 1947, <b>hexaethyl</b> <b>tetraphosphate</b> {{was being}} {{produced}} {{on a commercial}} scale. It cost US$1.10 per pound {{in the form of}} drums and $2.00 per pound in the form of carboys. In the 1940s, the chemical was commercially produced at concentrations of 50%.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hexaethyl</b> <b>tetraphosphate</b> is a {{chemical}} compound with the chemical formula (C2H5O)6P4O7. It is a yellow, light amber-colored or brown liquid. The chemical {{is also known}} as HET. Its ChemSpider ID is 12420. It is a constituent of the insecticide Bladan. In the 1940s, it was about as significant an insecticide as DDT and was referred to as [...] "another of DDT's rivals for fame" [...] in a 1948 book.|$|E
