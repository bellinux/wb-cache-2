40|$|The {{measurement}} {{properties and}} {{construct validity of}} the two-factor 11 -item Circadian Type Inventory (CTI) was examined in a working sample comprising shiftworkers and day workers. The two factors explained 50. 04 % of the variance (LV = 20. 24 % and FR = 29. 80 %). Inter-item correlations were all significant and the item-total correlations suggested the weakness of one item in the LV scale. Cronbach s alpha was 0. 72 (LV) and 0. 79 (FR). Confirmatory factor analysis however provided marginal support for the posited structure. Vigorous types were significantly more alert than languid types across the day and suggested they are less influenced by sleep inertia on waking. Vigorous types also reported needing significantly less sleep. Significant differences in alertness between flexible and <b>rigid</b> <b>types</b> were found between 16 : 00 and 22 : 00 and suggested flexible types are less influenced by circadian and wakefulness factors during these periods. Flexible types also reported significantly less sleep need compared to <b>rigid</b> <b>types.</b> The findings suggested vigorous and flexible types would best cope with shiftwork. It is concluded that the CTI demonstrated good reliability and validity in a working sample. Recommendations for future studies are made...|$|R

We use union type domains to increase the flexibility of <b>rigid</b> <b>type</b> definition in relational databases. In addition, we implement the grep operator in the relational algebra to facilitate queries on semistructured data. Grep returns a relation which could contain the type and name of the attribute where it finds the match and the position in that attribute and value of the match. Moreover, we also implement top-level scalar and substring function which are also very useful in a relational database language...|$|R

This model, which is developed with software ANSYS, has a simple geometrical configuration to provide the uncoupled and coupled acoustic–structural modes of the cabin with computing minimum time.

The results of the first coupled–system modes are of <b>rigid</b> <b>type</b> and they have frequencies smaller than 5 Hz.
