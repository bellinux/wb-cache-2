25|$|On November 9, 2010, Boeing 787, ZA002 made an {{emergency}} landing at Laredo International Airport, Texas, after smoke and flames were detected in the main cabin during a test flight. The electrical fire caused some systems to fail before landing. Following this incident, Boeing suspended flight testing on November 10, 2010, ground testing continued. After investigation, the in-flight fire was primarily attributed to foreign object debris (FOD) that was present in the <b>electrical</b> <b>bay.</b> After electrical system and software changes, the 787 resumed flight testing on December 23, 2010.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} Bay K 8644 on {{the release of}} [3 H]-noradrenaline evoked by potassium, {{electrical}} stimulation or tyramine from the rat isolated vas deferens labelled with [3 H]-noradrenaline were investigated. Bay K 8644 (1 microM) by itself {{did not affect the}} spontaneous release of tritium from the rat isolated vas deferens. However, it increased the calcium-dependent release of tritium elicited by both high potassium (59 mM) and electrical field stimulation. The exposure of rat vas deferens to phentolamine (10 microM) increased the release of tritium induced by potassium (59 mM) and <b>electrical</b> field stimulation. <b>Bay</b> K 8644 (1 microM) failed to increase further the release of tritium elicited by both stimuli in preparations previously treated with phentolamine (10 microM). The calcium-independent release of [3 H]-noradrenaline evoked by tyramine (10 microM) was not affected by Bay K 8644 (1 microM). The results of our study support the view that alpha 2 -adrenoceptors modulate noradrenaline release by restricting calcium influx into sympathetic nerve terminals through voltage-dependent channels...|$|R
