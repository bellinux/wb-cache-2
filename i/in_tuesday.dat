Thursday I have forgotten: Saturday, I {{began again}} on Davie; on Sunday, the Jersey party {{came up to}} call and carried me to dinner. [...] As I came out, to ride home, the search-lights of the CURACOA were lightening on the horizon from many miles away, and next morning she came <b>in.</b> <b>Tuesday</b> was huge fun: a reception at Haggard's. All our party dined there; Lloyd and I, {{in the absence of}} Haggard and Leigh, had to play aide-de-camp and host for about twenty minutes, and I presented the population of Apia at random but (luck helping) without one mistake. [...] Wednesday we had two middies to lunch. Thursday we had Eeles and Hoskyn (lieutenant and doctor - very, very nice fellows - simple, good and not the least dull) to dinner. Saturday, Graham and I lunched on board; Graham, Belle, Lloyd dined at the G.'s; and Austin and the WHOLE of our servants went with them to an evening entertainment; the more bold returning by lantern-light. Yesterday, Sunday, Belle and I were off by about half past eight, left our horses at a public house, and went on board the CURACOA in the wardroom skiff; were entertained in the wardroom; thence on deck to the service, which was a great treat; three fiddles and a harmonium and excellent choir, and the great ship's company joining: on shore in Haggard's big boat to lunch with the party. Thence all together to Vailima, where we read aloud a Ouida Romance we have been secretly writing; in which Haggard was the hero, and each one of the authors had to draw a portrait of him or herself in a Ouida light. Leigh, Lady J., Fanny, R.L.S., Belle and Graham were the authors.|$|E

50|$|In 1994, {{executive}} producer Ron Saunders approached Jay Rayvid, a producer at WQED, Pittsburgh's local PBS station (known for producing Mister Rogers' Neighborhood) {{to see if}} the station was interested in helping to get Johnson and Friends on television in the United States. Jay agreed, but was unable to find a market for the series as a standalone program. By this point, 52 episodes (the first three series) had been produced and were licensed to WQED. FOX Kids were looking to start a preschool series around the same time and thus The Fox Cubhouse was created. WQED and FOX teamed up and implemented Johnson and Friends as a segment <b>in</b> <b>Tuesday</b> and Thursday episodes of the 'Cubhouse'. In addition, The Fox Cubhouse itself was shot at WQED. Occasionally, two Johnson and Friends episodes would feature as part of a 'Cubhouse' episode instead of one.|$|E

50|$|Rob DJ's Monday Night Pub Quiz - The team {{played a}} 5-question pub quiz against each other. The {{questions}} {{were taken from}} a real pub quiz run the previous evening by one of Moyles' friends, Rob DJ, in their mutual home town of Leeds. Running totals of each team member's recent scores were kept and analysed. Since 2007, the quiz became an interactive feature, with listeners able to play along via SMS and more recently through Facebook and Twitter. A basic rule of the quiz was that the only answer taken as correct is that given by Rob DJ, regardless of its accuracy or clarity. However, inaccuracies or any vagueness in Rob DJ's answers were usually vigorously debated amongst the team, with Moyles usually bearing down for the answer {{to be taken in}} his favour. Chris Moyles won the pub quiz in both 2007. and 2008. This feature appeared <b>in</b> <b>Tuesday</b> shows, sometime between 7:45 and 8:15.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the sphere}} of {{organized}} warfare, Týr/Tiw had become relatively unimportant compared to Odin/Woden in both North and West Germanic by {{the close of the}} Migration Age.

5000|$|The Hymn of Kassiani is chanted {{only once}} a year during Holy Week, {{at the end of}} the aposticha at Matins on Great and Holy Wednesday, which is {{traditionally}} served <b>in</b> <b>Tuesday</b> evening. The music for the hymn is slow, sorrowful and plaintive. It lasts about ten to twenty minutes, depending on tempo and style of execution. It requires a very wide vocal range, and is considered one of the most demanding, if not the most demanding, pieces of solo Byzantine chant, and cantors take great pride in delivering it well. It is also sung by choirs in unison, often underpinned by Byzantine vocal bass drone. The faithful make a point of going to church specifically [...] "to listen to Kassiani" [...] that evening. In many places in Greece, the Bridegroom Matins service of Great Tuesday is popular with sex workers, who may not often be seen in church at other times of the year. They come in great numbers, in order to hear the Hymn of Kassiani, as the hymn is associated with the woman fallen in many sins.|$|E
