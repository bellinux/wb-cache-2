This relationship is examined within the context of media commercialization. Based on the assumption that in cultures of democratic political communication the interaction between media and political actors involves both conflict and cooperation, we consider how journalists and politicians negotiate the balance of power between them. The empirical evidence gathered from semistructured <b>interviews</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> suggests that the interaction between media and political elites in Taiwan is defined by high levels of conflict, hostility, mutual suspicion, and mistrust?attributes of a relationship that can have profound implications for the legitimacy and efficacy of institutions, actors, and political communications in a newly created democratic system. The article explains the evidence through the perspective of the ?knowledge deficit model? that operates within the context of media commercialization. This indicates that the perceptions (of the public, journalists, and politicians) of the formal aspects of democracy may have been transformed, but the nuances that define the application of democratic norms (the practice of responsible journalism) remain ambiguous. More importantly, huge market pressures and the widely accepted media logic, coupled with the democratic knowledge deficit, are creating a vicious cycle in the practice of political communication in Taiwan.

Most physicians and pharmacists knew the correct cause of the pediatric common cold, but majorities of the physicians and pharmacists believed that antibiotics could treat and reduce its complications. On the other hand, 34 % of the parents believed that antibiotics could prevent complications. Seventy three per cent of the physicians reported that they perceived expectations for antibiotics from parents, but only 2 % of the parents reported asking their physicians for antibiotics. In summary, this study suggests that physicians' knowledge and faulty beliefs can be more important factors for inappropriate antibiotic prescription.

40|$|Alternative conflictresolution – How peer {{mediation}} effects children´s relationships Peer mediation is {{a process}} for resolving conflicts and disputes in which neutral parties (peers) act as moderators in the process. My aim in <b>this</b> <b>article</b> is to discuss how the mediation influences children’s relations during a school-break? The article does also discuss conflicts, emotions and the peers experiences of mediation. I am inspired by conflict and mediation theories and my methods are observations and <b>interviews.</b> My focus <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> is an observation during a school-break. The three pairs of mediators and the teacher act in different ways when trying to resolve the conflict related to four girls who were bickering about a skipping-rope and that rendered different results. ”Neglect” of the conflict resulted in an escalation and in a traditional and disciplinary way of handling the conflict, but focusing the wrongdoers, the conflict continued. In the restorative way of handling the conflict during a mediation process it also effects {{the children who were}} not involved in the conflict. The girls stopped bickering and the children involved and other children started to play together in a more interactive way. 	Peer mediation is a method of conflict resolution and it is oriented towards sustainable change. It is also an alternative to traditional disciplinary practices and does neither juridificate nor criminalizes children’s behaviour which happens when the schools report the children´s conflicts to the police.

40|$|As part of {{an effort}} to {{encourage}} foreign direct investment, developing nations have signed over 1500 bilateral investment treaties (BITs) in just the last fifteen years. BITs grant foreign investors substantive rights, such as freedom from expropriation and the right to sue governments directly for a breach of the treaty in a process known as investment treaty arbitration. Over the last five years, the number of investment treaty arbitration claims filed against developing nations has more than tripled. The stakes are high: investor claims routinely seek damages in excess of $ 100, 000, 000 and challenge host state regulation of basic public services like water, energy, and waste disposal. Mounting an effective defense to these claims is essential for a developing nation, as even a single adverse award could wreak havoc on its economy, weaken its capacity to regulate in the public interest, and damage its reputation as a desirable investment location. However, due to financial and administrative barriers, many developing nations do not have the legal expertise within their government service to defend investment treaty claims. As a consequence, most are forced to hire one of a handful of international law firms who charge the same premium market rates that wealthy individual investors and corporations pay for their services. Meanwhile, developing nations who cannot hire outside counsel face scattered and incomplete sources of legal authority, uncertainty over the meaning of key BIT provisions, and no organized legal assistance from the international community. Unfortunately, these concerns are far from theoretical: in <b>interviews</b> done <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>article,</b> developing nation lawyers report not having access to fundamental sources of arbitration law, or having to go to extraordinary lengths to obtain it. Developing nations’ lack of access to affordable legal authority and expertise threatens the legitimacy of investment treaty arbitration by furthering the damaging perception that the arbitration process is unfairly tilted toward investors and wealthier States. The time is right for the establishment of a legal assistance center for developing nations facing actual or potential investment treaty arbitration claims. A legal assistance center would bolster the legitimacy of the investment treaty arbitration process by ensuring that developing nations have, at a minimum, access to fundamental legal authority and some basic level of legal expertise. A legal assistance center would not only promote fairness for developing nations, but also lead to a more efficient and effective arbitration process. Better informed developing nation counsel will make more cogent legal arguments, enhancing the quality and efficiency of the arbitration process as well as the ultimate result. By ensuring that developing nations have affordable access to legal authority and expertise, a legal assistance center will ensure that investment treaty arbitration more perfectly fulfills its vital mission of providing a truly neutral and just form of dispute settlement...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{ostensible}} {{purpose for}} pretrial litigation {{is to prepare}} for trial, such preparation is inextricably intertwined with negotiation because the expected trial outcome {{is a major factor}} affecting negotiation. Indeed, since most litigated cases are settled, good litigators prepare for negotiation {{at least as much as}} trial. The lawyers <b>interviewed</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>article,</b> who were selected because of their good reputations, described how they prepare for both possibilities. They recommend taking charge of their cases from the outset, which includes getting a clear understanding of clients and their interests, developing good relationships with counterpart lawyers, carefully investigating the cases, making strategic decisions about timing, and enlisting mediators and courts when needed. The lawyers overwhelmingly suggested starting negotiation at the earliest appropriate time. Reaching agreement sooner generally produces the benefit of reduced litigation costs as well as reduced time that parties invest in litigation. Lawyers produce better agreements when they focus on both sides’ interests because this enables them to create value, even in supposedly zero-sum negotiations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Until {{the middle}} of the twentieth century, a {{self-employed}} Sámi reindeer herder in Norway could subsist on 250 reindeer. These were owned individually but cared for collectively by means of flexible entre-preneurial networks. Human existence reflected the needs of herds, and rather than manage their reindeer, herders read their cues and followed the herds. Flexibility was the key to success. Non-breeding male reindeer were useful in that they helped females find food in winter. When an ani-mal was slaughtered, care was taken to minimize pain and avoid waste; every part of a reindeer was used. Today, snowmobiles, GPS technology, helicopters and increased regulation are transforming the sector. Reindeer herders, <b>interviewed</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>article,</b> have been adapting successfully to technological, regulatory and other changes. Yet they are concerned that, if herding is reduced to an element of the food industry, the essence and efficiency of their community-based, symbiotic entrepreneurship will be undermined. The reindeer remain a symbol for the Sámi. However, while reindeer herders are attracted or pulled towards traditional community entrepreneurship, many are forced or pushed into secondary money-driven enterprises, less close to their tradition...|$|E
40|$|In {{contemporary}} theatre {{the division}} between the different components within {{the production of a}} performance or play is often blurry. What then is the role and function of scenography? And who is the scenographer? In this article we explore how scenography relates to the performance as a whole and how it is now more explicitly considered to be a ‘producer of meaning’, resulting in a particular focus on the visual and sensuous aspects of the production process. Three pairs of theatre and performance creators within the Norwegian contemporary scene have been <b>interviewed</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>article,</b> and their projects constitute the material for discussion: 1) The art and theatre company Verdensteatret, 2) Heine Avdal and Yukiko Shinozaki, contemporary dance developers, and 3) Director Eirik Stubø and scenographer Kari Gravklev. Through an analysis of their performances in relation to the interview material, it has become clear that the role of the scenographer as a distinct function is far from distinct - only one of the interviewed artists calls herself scenographer, for the others it is more a matter of opposing to the term or of not really relating to it. Here, the theatre institutions as well as the art institutional contexts seem to be significant. Scenography however, as a field of investigation, becomes all the more relevant both inside and outside institutions, representing a sensuous landscaping that involves both context and matter...|$|E
