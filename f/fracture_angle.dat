Previous studies investigated small ranges of rotational velocities in animal long bone models, although did not report the variation in the spiral <b>fracture</b> <b>angle.</b> This study considered the <b>fracture</b> <b>angle</b> as a potential clinical measure, correlating this data with {{a wider range of}} rotational velocities. The spiral <b>fracture</b> <b>angle</b> was measured relative to the long axis, whilst noting the narrowest diaphysial diameter, location of the fracture, and the extent of comminution and periosteal disruption. Twenty-six bones failed in spiral fracture, with the potting material failing in the remaining tests. All spiral fractures centred on the narrowest diaphysial diameter. Slower rotational velocities caused fracture angles approaching 45 °, whereas fractures at greater velocities caused fracture angles nearer 30 °. A relatively strong trend (R 2 = 0. 78) is reported when the normalised <b>fracture</b> <b>angle</b> (against the narrowest diaphysial dimension) was plotted against the rotational rate. A relationship has been identified between the angle of spiral fracture and the rotational velocity using the immature bovine metatarsal model.

The torsional <b>fracture</b> <b>angle</b> {{and the number}} of cycles of torsion at breaking were recorded, and the effect of the gauge length and pretension together with the torsion speed on the torsion properties of single silk fibre was investigated in detail. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and a tensile tester were used to understand the morphology, structure and tensile properties of silk fibre after torsion deformation. SME photos show that silk fibre exhibits a ribbon-like profile after torsion, and fracture tends to occur {{at both ends of the}} silk fibre, where a larger number of twists can be observed. The crystallinity calculated from XRD spectra of silk fibre increases from 26. 11 % to 34. 10 % after torsion. The breaking stress and strain decreases slightly with an increase in the gauge length. The breaking cycle increases linearly with an increase in the gauge length, while the actual torsional <b>fracture</b> <b>angle</b> decreases gradually at the same time.

The mandibular <b>angle</b> <b>fractures</b> were assessed by taking an orthopantomograph for each case following strict radiation protection protocol after an informed consent was obtained. The captured image was assessed and traced for the presence of mandibular <b>angle</b> <b>fracture,</b> angulation, and status of mandibular third molar by using Windows Trophy DICOM and Master View 3. 0 software.

Results: We observed the following: Increased incidence of <b>angle</b> <b>fractures</b> in the presence of mandibular third molar, male predominance, the mean average age being 29 years, and the most common cause of <b>angle</b> <b>fractures</b> was road traffic accident; the fractures were observed more on the left side.

40|$|Trauma {{interpretation}} {{is one of}} the most essential and challenging areas offorensic anthropology. When examining bone fragments commonly encountered in real forensic anthropological casework, the ambiguity and difficulty assessing the trauma type and bone condition at the time of fracture is markedly more difficult. Traditional features used to distinguish bone condition and trauma type have included fracture surface texture and <b>fracture</b> <b>angle,</b> however, these features have not been explored in depth in terms their reliability and these observational categories remain poorly defined. In the current study, I examine fracture angles and surfaces produced from ballistic (115 g 9 mm FMJ and 147 g HP ammunition) and blunt force trauma (10 lb. sledge hammer) on bovine long bones in different states of preservation (frozen, fresh, dry). Building on previous anthropological research and the mechanical literature, I attempt to refine the criteria of `smooth' and `rough / jagged' used to describe surface texture and attempt correlate the criteria to bone condition and trauma type. Using Microsil, a forensic casting material, I present a straightforward method for capturing and assessing surface information without the confounding features of color and moisture. Seven sampling sites were selected from each bone, four from the entrance / point of impact side and three from the exit / posterior to impact side. All fractures cast and measured were longitudinal or radial fractures. Results of this study indicate that <b>fracture</b> <b>angle</b> does not demonstrate a statistically significant relationship with cortical bone thickness, nor does it correlate with type of trauma or bone condition. The only statistically significant relationship was between <b>fracture</b> <b>angle</b> and bone condition for fracture angles from the impact side of blunt force trauma specimens. Fracture surface characteristics do diverge among bone conditions, but not for trauma type. Qualitatively, for a single specimen, <b>fracture</b> <b>angle</b> and fracture surface characteristics appear to have limited value in the assessment of bone condition and / or trauma type. It is recommended for the determination of bone condition and trauma type that <b>fracture</b> <b>angle</b> and surface texture be not be used when analyzing single bones. Other observations, such as impact sites and projectile entries and exits, in combination with taphonomic indicators like color, staining, and context should be relied upon to describe and determine trauma type and bone condition...|$|E

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] When determining the time of occurrence of skeletal injuries forensic anthropologists know that antemortem skeletal injuries are recognized by evidence of healing. Perimortem and postmortem skeletal injuries are more difficult to distinguish between because neither shows evidence of healing. Additionally, bone does not lose its moisture and collagen immediately after death, so it continues to react to modifications in a perimortem rather than a postmortem manner. Using 60 porcine long bones, I documented the differences between macroscopic and microscopic blunt force trauma fracture characteristics as they varied when created every 28 days throughout a 141 day period. I determined how those changes correlated with bone moisture content and the postmortem interval. Results indicate that there is a significant relationship between postmortem interval and ash percentage, fracture surface, and <b>fracture</b> <b>angle.</b> There is also a significant correlation between overall assessment and postmortem interval, ash weight, fracture surface, and <b>fracture</b> <b>angle</b> as well as between ash weight and fracture surface and <b>fracture</b> <b>angle...</b>|$|E

40|$|A plane bimaterial {{model is}} {{introduced}} {{which allows the}} determination of the stress intensity factors KI and KII, as well as the <b>fracture</b> <b>angle</b> theta 0. The model is composed of a long orthogonal strip penetrating into an elastic orthogonal soft matrix.

For the evaluation of the components of the complex stress intensity factor, the optical method of reflected caustics is used. The orientation of both external and internal caustics yield also the <b>fracture</b> <b>angle</b> theta 0. A significant advantage of the model is that the developed cracks in the matrix may grow slowly at any desired velocity.

40|$|The {{concept of}} the average stress has been {{employed}} to propose the maximum average tangential stress (MATS) criterion for predicting the direction of <b>fracture</b> <b>angle.</b> This criterion states that a crack grows when the maximum average tangential stress in the fracture process zone ahead of the crack tip reaches its critical value and the crack growth direction coincides with {{the direction of the}} maximum average tangential stress along a constant radius around the crack tip.
