40|$|The <b>encompassing</b> {{principle}} {{has been}} carefully and precisely defined in various contexts, since its {{first appearance in}} the 1980 s literature in numerous papers by Hendry, Mizon and Richard. Since then, several distinct notions of <b>encompassing</b> have been proposed and still coexist in the literature. We describe, illustrate and connect these notions in this paper. We start with the intuitive properties of exact <b>encompassing</b> between estimated models and compare it with its testable counterpart, approximate <b>encompassing.</b> We examine these notions and their main properties within static and dynamic, parametric and non-parametric, classical and Bayesian models and estimators. <b>Encompassing</b> {{or the lack of}} <b>encompassing,</b> is also studied via the concepts of parsimonious and partial <b>encompassing.</b> Pseudo-true values, which are central elements in measuring and testing approximate <b>encompassing,</b> are defined in line with the concept of specificity between models. We also examine the role played by the data generating process in the different approaches in the literature.
