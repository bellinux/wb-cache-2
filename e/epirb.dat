25|$|The ship is now {{believed}} to have sunk in international waters after the <b>EPIRB</b> distress signals were activated in early 2013.|$|E
25|$|A review {{published}} in October 2013 cites {{the receipt of}} two <b>EPIRB</b> distress signals from Lyubov Orlova in mid-ocean, one on 23 February and another on 12 March.|$|E
25|$|All aboard {{successfully}} abandoned ship. As the capsizing was so fast, no radio {{distress call}} was made but a distress radiobeacon (<b>EPIRB)</b> was hydrostatically released and automatically activated when the vessel sank.|$|E
50|$|Many <b>EPIRBs</b> have an in-built Global Positioning System receiver. When {{activated}} these <b>EPIRBs</b> rapidly {{report the}} {{latitude and longitude}} of the emergency accurate to within 120m. The position of non-GPS <b>EPIRBs</b> {{is determined by the}} orbiting satellites, this can take ninety minutes to five hours after activation and is accurate to within 5 km. Marine safety authorities recommend the use of GPS-equipped <b>EPIRBs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Automatic <b>EPIRBs</b> are water activated, while {{automatic}} ELTs have impact monitors {{activated by}} g-force. Some <b>EPIRBs</b> also [...] "deploy"; {{this means that}} they physically depart from their mounting bracket on {{the exterior of the}} vessel (usually by going into the water.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Inmarsat-E - This service ended 1 December 2006; all former {{users have}} {{switched}} to Category I or II 406 MHz <b>EPIRBs.</b> These beacons were float-free, automatically activated <b>EPIRBs</b> operated on 1646 MHz. They were detectable by Inmarsat geostationary satellites, and were recognized by GMDSS. See Inmarsat-E.|$|R

2500|$|The Concordia sank at 1423 hrs {{local time}} Wednesday. [...] At 1425 Concordia's Bosun Geoffrey Byers swam to {{retrieve}} the <b>EPIRB</b> and brought it aboard the rafts. The Captain directed that someone hold the <b>EPIRB</b> upright at all times and keep it safe from damage. The <b>EPIRB</b> signal was received at 1505 hrs by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite GOES 12. The position of the sinking, , was resolved at 1525 local time. The TSB report noted the <b>EPIRB</b> database only listed one telephone number for the Concordia and that number {{had not been in}} service since 2004.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 February, {{the ship}} {{was the subject of}} news reports in Iceland and Ireland, and a caution to smaller vessels was issued. On 1 March 2013, Irish media {{reported}} that a signal from the vessel's emergency position-indicating radio beacon (<b>EPIRB)</b> was received from 700 nautical miles off the Kerry coast, still in international waters. An <b>EPIRB</b> starts transmitting only when the device is exposed to water, leading experts to speculate that the ship may have sunk. [...] The Irish Air Corps was expected to continue to monitor the region.|$|E
5000|$|Once deployed, <b>EPIRBs</b> can be activated, {{depending}} on the circumstances, either manually (crewman flicks a switch) or automatically (when water contacts the unit's [...] "sea-switch".) All modern <b>EPIRBs</b> provide both methods of activation and deployment, and thus are labelled [...] "Manual and Automatic Deployment and Activation." ...|$|R

2500|$|During {{shooting}} {{of the first}} season of Deadliest Catch, the F/V Big Valley sank on January 15, 2005, sometime after 0734 Alaska Standard Time when the Coast Guard first detected her <b>EPIRB</b> signal. Five members of the six man crew perished; three were never found. Cache Seel was the only survivor. Discovery Channel camera crews on the Maverick and Cornelia Marie captured the first footage of the debris field, confirming that the boat had capsized and gone down. The search for the ship is featured in the episode [...] "Dead of Winter".|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the film}} has been criticized in the sailing world for being unrealistic, in {{particular}} {{for the lack of}} certain safety equipment deemed standard for sailboats navigating the open ocean such as an <b>EPIRB,</b> and other bad decisions of the main character. An exception to this criticism is English Yachting Monthly, for which Dick Durham claimed: [...] "Certainly the film is authentic and grippingly realistic." [...] Director Chandor himself, who says he went sailing with his parents when young and later a few times as an adult, stated in an interview with German sailing magazine Segeln that everything that happened in the film could have happened in reality. His only reservations were the probability of crossing the Indian Ocean single-handed and of not evading the storm with modern technology and due attention.|$|E

50|$|In addition, a {{distress}} can be signaled using automated {{radio signals}} {{such as a}} Search and Rescue Transponder (SART) which responds to 9 GHz radar signal, or an Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacon (<b>EPIRB)</b> which operates in the 406 MHz radio frequency. <b>EPIRB</b> signals are received and processed by a constellation of satellites known as COSPAS-SARSAT. Older EPIRBs which use 121.5 MHz are obsolete. Many regulators require vessels which proceed offshore to carry an <b>EPIRB.</b>|$|E
50|$|An Emergency Position-Indicating Radiobeacon Station or Emergency Position Indicator Radio Beacon (short: EPIRS or <b>EPIRB)</b> is {{a station}} in the mobile service used in search and rescue operations. In marine use the {{terminology}} Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon (<b>EPIRB)</b> is used.|$|E
50|$|EPIRBs {{must not}} be {{disposed}} of into general waste as discarded EPIRBs often trigger at the waste disposal facility. In 2013 the majority of <b>EPIRB</b> activations investigated by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority were due to the incorrect disposal of obsolete 121.5 MHz <b>EPIRB</b> beacons.|$|E
50|$|To avoid {{pointless}} searches some devices must {{be reported}} when lost. This particularly applies to <b>EPIRBs,</b> life buoys, rafts and devices {{marked with the}} vessel's name and port.|$|R
2500|$|Estonias {{distress}} beacons or <b>EPIRBs</b> required manual activation, {{which did}} not happen. Had they been activated automatically, {{it would have been}} immediately obvious that the ship had sunk and the location would have been clear. All <b>EPIRBs</b> were subsequently required to deploy automatically and the accident was [...] "instrumental in the move to legislate Voyage Data Recorders". New International Maritime Organisation (IMO) Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) liferaft regulations for rescue from listing ships in rough water were introduced, though launching such craft, even in training exercises, remains dangerous for the crew.|$|R

5000|$|For {{a marine}} <b>EPIRB</b> to begin {{transmitting}} a signal (or [...] "activate") it first {{needs to come}} out of its bracket (or [...] "deploy"). Deployment can happen either manually where someone must physically remove it from its bracket or automatically where water pressure will cause a hydrostatic release unit to separate the <b>EPIRB</b> from its bracket. If it does not come out of the bracket it will not activate. There is a magnet in the bracket which operates a reed safety switch in the <b>EPIRB.</b> This prevents accidental activation if the unit gets wet from rain or shipped seas.|$|E

5000|$|... 121.5 and 243.0 MHz <b>EPIRBs</b> {{are banned}} on {{boats in the}} United States and in many other jurisdictions. More {{information}} about the switch to 406 is available on Cospas-Sarsat's 121.5/243 Phase-Out page.|$|R
5000|$|The {{dangers of}} unassisted sailing {{have been reduced}} {{in recent years by}} the {{widespread}} use of <b>EPIRBs</b> that allow the sailor to summon help even when far from land. One such case occurred in January 1997 when Tony Bullimore was rescued by the Australian Navy after 5 days under a capsized yacht far from the Australian mainland. [...] A few decades earlier this situation would have had a high probability of resulting in his death. <b>EPIRBs</b> greatly increase the chance that the sailor will be found. They have been credited by sailors as being [...] "vital for sailing boats" [...] and [...] "without question" [...] have saved lives.|$|R
