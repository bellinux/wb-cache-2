40|$|Increasing {{the number}} of cold-start engine cycles which could be run in any one day would greatly improve the {{productivity}} of an engine test facility. However {{with the introduction of}} forced cooling procedures there is the inherent risk that test-to-test repeatability will be affected. Therefore an investigation into the effects caused by forced cooling on fuel consumption and the temperature distribution through the engine and fluids is essential. Testing was completed on a 2. 4 litre diesel engine running a cold NEDC. The test facility utilises a basic ventilation system, which draws in external ambient air, which is forced past the engine and then drawn out of the cell. This can be supplemented {{with the use of a}} spot cooling fan. The <b>forced</b> <b>cool</b> <b>down</b> resulted in a much quicker cool down which was further reduced with spot cooling, in the region of 25 % reduction. The implementation of forced cooling was found to have a small but repeatable effect on the fuel consumption, around 1 %, and the fluid temperature distribution through the engine. Using this data it is possible to increase {{the number of}} cold start tests performed per day from one to three...|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} {{concerned}} with the thermal processes during the heating up and <b>cooling</b> <b>down</b> of a furnace, used in the production of ceramic multilayer actuators. The objective of the investigation was first to describe these thermal processes in a batch furnace and then design a furnace which is operated continuously. Time and location dependent measurements have been done in batch furnaces of 60 and 300 litre. The objects in the furnaces are heated up by radiation from sources in the fiunace walls, and <b>cool</b> <b>down</b> after the sources have been switched off, after which either nothing is done with the furnace (natural cooling) or air is blovwn through the furnace (<b>forced</b> <b>cooling).</b> The heating up of the furnace and its complexly shaped contents, has been modelled with a Finite Element Method (FEM) package, viz. Ansys. Hereby it is possible to calculate the temperature distribution in a 3 dimensional geometry as a function of time and place. These simulations have been compared with measurements. The measurements and the simulations agree reasonably well. More simple models are used to describe natural and <b>forced</b> <b>cooling</b> of the furnace and it...|$|R
40|$|In the 4 T, 12. 5 m long, 6 m bore {{diameter}} superconducting solenoid for the {{compact muon solenoid}} (CMS) experiment at large hadron collider (LHC), the interfaces between the insulation and the conductor or the external cylinder are subjected to high shear <b>forces</b> during the <b>cool</b> <b>down</b> to 4. 5 K and the operation phase up to 4 T. Due to the conductive cooling of the coil, the bonding at the different interfaces is a critical point, which {{is directly related to}} the quality of the surfaces. The influence of the surface treatment of the conductor on its adhesion properties has been studied at room temperature and in liquid helium at 4. 2 K, using a shear force measurement procedure developed in our lab or a peeling test with tape. This paper presents the experimental results obtained on samples treated with solvent cleaning, sandblasting or anodic oxidation under four different sets of experimental conditions, then wrapped with glass tape and impregnated under vacuum. The robustness of the anodic oxidation process, as well as the effect of ageing a few months before impregnation is shown. (3 refs) ...|$|R

50|$|An engine needs {{different}} temperatures. The inlet {{including the}} compressor of a turbo {{and in the}} inlet trumpets and the inlet valves need to be as cold as possible. A countercurrent heat exchange with <b>forced</b> <b>cooling</b> air does the job. The cylinder-walls should not heat up the air before compression, but also not <b>cool</b> <b>down</b> the gas at the combustion. A compromise is a wall temperature of 90 Â°C. The viscosity of the oil is optimized for just this temperature. Any cooling of the exhaust and the turbine of the turbocharger reduces the amount of power available to the turbine, so the exhaust system is often insulated between engine and turbocharger to keep the exhaust gases as hot as possible.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the first}} running of NASCAR's new-for-2014 {{knockout}} qualifying system, Brad Keselowski won the pole {{with a new}} track record time of 25.828 and a speed of 139.384 mph. Keselowski was intrigued {{as to how the}} qualifying session looked to the general public, stating [...] "I'm more curious the feedback we get from our fans" [...] and that [...] "at {{the end of the day}} it's not about whether I like it, it's about whether they liked it". Kevin Harvick, who missed out on the top 12 placings by 0.001 seconds in the first part of the session, complained about the cooling of the cars, defining it as [...] "dumb", while also praising the qualifying concept as [...] "really cool, but they need to let you <b>cool</b> the cars <b>down.</b> One of these times somebody is going to get clobbered in the back". NASCAR did not allow teams to use cool-down units and teams were <b>forced</b> to run <b>cool</b> <b>down</b> laps on the track while other drivers were making qualifying laps. Defending champion Jimmie Johnson opined that everyone understood [...] "what NASCAR is trying to do, and I'm confident that if there is a problem they'll make some changes". NASCAR vice president for competition Robin Pemberton stated that the organization would [...] "continue to talk to the drivers and teams and solicit feedback and how, if anything, we can improve". Justin Allgaier crashed his car during the opening session, switched to a backup car and started last as a result.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cool</b> <b>downs</b> should {{involve the}} {{following}} steps to ensure an effective <b>cool</b> <b>down.</b> After exercise, a gradual yet continuous decrease in exercise intensity (i.e. from a hard run to an easy jog to a brisk walk) {{should be the first}} step in <b>cooling</b> <b>down</b> the body. Duration can vary for different people, but 3-7 minutes is considered adequate. Stretching, especially static stretching allows the muscles to be elongated and lengthened. This is the next step athletes should take to <b>cool</b> <b>down.</b> Rehydration {{is an essential part of}} the procedure and should be done either during stretching and light intensity or after these steps. Refuelling the body with electrolytes like water and sports drinks will keep the body hydrated.|$|R

Kasey Kahne cut a tire <b>down</b> on his <b>cool</b> <b>down</b> lap. Upon exiting his car, Kahne felt that [...] "NASCAR doesn't have enough people to make a call that we can change it" [...] and that he [...] "sat there and waited and we didn't get to cool our car down".

5000|$|<b>Cooling</b> <b>down</b> (BETTER {{known as}} [...] "warm down") (the {{prescribed}} event {{of which is}} called a <b>cool</b> <b>down,</b> cooldown, or cool-down; or warm down, in allusion to use in combination with warm up) is an easy exercise, done after a more intense activity, to allow the body to gradually transition to a resting or near-resting state. Depending on {{the intensity of the}} exercise, <b>cooling</b> <b>down</b> can involve a slow jog or walk. With lower intensities stretching can be used. <b>Cooling</b> <b>down</b> allows the heart rate to return to its resting rate. Anecdotally <b>cooling</b> <b>down</b> may reduce dizziness for professional or serious athletes and vocal performers after strenuous workouts. Studies are currently inconclusive as to whether the process actually reduces delayed-onset muscle soreness and muscle soreness not caused by lactate production during intense exercise. Some have shown a weak correlation: however, the majority of recent studies discount the relationship. One study has shown that athletes who perform an appropriate cool-down are less likely to become injured.|$|R
