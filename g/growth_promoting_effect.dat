5000|$|Induced Systemic Resistance (ISR) is an {{activated}} resistance {{process that}} is activated by biological or abiotic factors and {{is dependent on the}} physical or chemical barrier of the host plant, and its action is characterized by no direct killing or inhibition of the pathogen, but through the induction of plant disease resistance to disease prevention and control purposes.Induced resistance of plants, including plants in the role of exogenous factors under the two types of reactions. One is a rapid local reaction, the pathogen is limited to a small area of the site of infection, the other is a series of induced plant defense function, so that crops produce a comprehensive resistance, that induced resistance to the system. The induction of plant-induced resistance to pathogen protection, as early as 1901 that is known, and is known as the [...] "system of acquired resistance." [...] After this description of the phenomenon, several different terms have been used, namely, [...] "acquired physiological immunity", [...] "resistance displacement", [...] "plant immune function" [...] and [...] "induced system resistance." [...] (Mechanical or dry ice damage, electromagnetic, ultraviolet and low temperature and high temperature treatment, etc.) and chemical factors (heavy metal salts, water (water, salt, water), water, water, and so on), many biological factors (fungi, bacteria, viruses and their metabolites) Salicylic acid, etc.) can induce the plant to the virus, bacteria and fungi and other disease resistance. In practice, biological factors and chemical factors in melons, tobacco, bean, potato and rice induced resistance applications have achieved great success. Over the past decade, the study of induced system resistance has become a very active field.The biological factors of plant-induced system resistance generally include two broad categories, namely classical plant-induced resistance to disease induction(PGPR) or fungi that promote plant growth(PGPF), and plant growth-promoting rhizosphere bacteria (PGPR) or plant growth promoting fungi (PGPF). The difference is mainly {{due to the fact that}} the latter can effectively promote plant growth and increase crop yield while causing (or increasing) plant resistance to diseases (sometimes including pests).To date, work on induction of plant systemic resistance has shown that inducing plant system resistance work has important implications for basic and applied research. From the basic research point of view, whether chemical factors or biological factors induced, are involved in plant identification of exogenous factors, plant physiological and metabolic changes and plant and pathogen interaction process, is to study the interaction between plants and exogenous factors Of the very good material.

The aim of the paper is to provide a review of mannan oligosaccharide products in relation to their <b>growth</b> <b>promoting</b> <b>effect</b> and mode of action based on the latest publications. We discuss the dietary impact of MOSs on (1) microbial changes, (2) morphological changes of gut tissue and digestibility of nutrients, and (3) immune response of pigs after weaning. Dietary MOSs maintain the intestinal integrity and the digestive and absorptive function of the gut in the post-weaning period. Recent results suggest that MOS enhances the disease resistance in swine by promoting antigen presentation facilitating thereby the shift from an innate to an adaptive immune response. Accordingly, dietary MOS supplementation has a potential <b>growth</b> <b>promoting</b> <b>effect</b> in pigs kept in a poor hygienic environment, while the positive effect of MOS is not observed in healthy pig herds with high hygienic standards that are able to maintain a high growth rate after weaning...|$|E

Binding affinities and <b>growth</b> <b>promoting</b> <b>effects</b> of the N-terminal fusion Z-IGF-I and the C-terminal fusion IGF-I-Z, and native recombinant human IGF-I, were analyzed. Binding kinetic properties of the three IGF-I variants were analyzed using BIAcore kinetic interaction analysis testing for binding to both human IGF binding protein 1 (IGFBP- 1) and a soluble form of the human IGF type I receptor extracellular domains (sIGF-IR). The <b>growth</b> <b>promoting</b> <b>effects</b> on SaOS- 2 human osteosarcoma cells of the different fusion proteins were analyzed. A comparison of receptor binding affinities and <b>growth</b> <b>promoting</b> <b>effects</b> shows that the fusion protein receptor affinity does not correlate with proliferative potential. The IGF-I-Z fusion, with the lowest receptor affinity, shows similar proliferative potential to native IGF-I. However, the Z-IGF-I fusion protein, with twice the receptor affinity of IGF-I-Z, displays only about 70 % of the IGF-I-Z <b>growth</b> <b>promoting</b> activity. Both IGF-I fusion proteins possess similar affinity to IGFBP- 1.

Exogenous growth hormone (GH) stimulates the endogenous production of IGF-I and improves growth in uremia. We investigated whether exogenous IGF-I is {{also able to}} improve uremic growth failure in rats and whether the <b>growth</b> <b>promoting</b> <b>effects</b> of GH and IGF-I are additive. In female 150 g uremic (subtotal nephrectomy, NX) Sprague-Dawley rats, both rhGH in doses from 2 × 1. 25 to 2 × 10 IU/kg bid s. c. and rhIGF-I in doses from 2 × 0. 5 to 2 × 4. 0 mg/kg bid s. c. caused a dose-dependent increase in weight gain and length gain. However, endogenous production of GH was suppressed by both agents. Peptide hormone treatment did not affect cumulative food intake, but significantly increased food efficiency ratio (weight gain/food intake). Concomitant s. c. treatment with maximally effective doses of rhGH (12 × 5 IU/kg bid) and of rhIGF-I (2 × 2 mg/kg bid) resulted in additive <b>growth</b> <b>promoting</b> <b>effects</b> in NX and pair-fed control (CO) animals during the observation period of 12 days. Cumulative length gain was 3. 2 ± 0. 5 cm in solvent-treated NX-animals, 4. 1 ± 0. 5 cm with rhGH (+ 28 % above solvent), 4. 2 ± 0. 6 cm with rhIGF-I (+ 31 %) and 4. 9 ± 0. 5 cm with both peptides (+ 53 %). The food efficiency ratio was 0. 16 ± 0. 05 in solvent NX, 0. 33 ± 0. 04 with rhGH (+ 106 % above solvent), 0. 23 ± 0. 02 with rhIGF-I (+ 44 %), and 0. 38 ± 0. 02 with both peptides (+ 138 %). Histomorphometric analysis and measurements of length gain by fluorescence microscopy in the upper tibial metaphysis confirmed the <b>growth</b> <b>promoting</b> <b>effects</b> of both peptide hormones. The serum concentrations of IGF binding protein (BP) - 4 (Western ligand blotting analysis) and of IGFBP- 2 (immunoblot) were increased in uremic animals whereas IGFBP- 3 was unchanged. Treatment with IGF-I and/or rhGH increased serum concentration of IGF-I but did not change the IGFBP pattern. rhIGF-I lowered blood glucose levels within one to two hours after injection. The effect was most pronounced during the first treatment day and declined thereafter. Concomitant treatment with rhGH attenuated the glucose lowering effect of rhIGF-I (glucose serum concentration at day one: 120 ± 11 mg% in solvent NX, 50 ± 21 mg% with rhIGF-I, 80 ± 24 mg% with both peptides). It is concluded that: (i) IGF-I is able to stimulate growth in NX animals but suppresses endogenous GH production in the long run; (ii) the concomitant treatment with IGF-I and GH has additive effects on growth; and (iii) concomitant treatment with rhGH prevents hypoglycemia that is noted with rhIGF-I alone...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} whether antibiotic treatment leads to improvements in growth in prepubertal children in low and middle income countries, {{to determine the}} magnitude of improvements in growth, and to identify moderators of this treatment effect. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, Scopus, the Cochrane central register of controlled trials, and Web of Science. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised controlled trials conducted in low or middle income countries in which an orally administered antibacterial agent was allocated by randomisation or minimisation and growth was measured as an outcome. Participants aged 1 month to 12 years were included. Control was placebo or non-antimicrobial intervention. RESULTS: Data were pooled from 10 randomised controlled trials representing 4316 children, {{across a variety of}} antibiotics, indications for treatment, treatment regimens, and countries. In random effects models, antibiotic use increased height by 0. 04 cm/month (95 % confidence interval 0. 00 to 0. 07) and weight by 23. 8 g/month (95 % confidence interval 4. 3 to 43. 3). After adjusting for age, effects on height were larger in younger populations and effects on weight were larger in African studies compared with other regions.

Root and shoot growth were determined measuring the length and projected area of their digitalized images. When treated with inocula concentrations ranging from 10 2 to 10 5 cells per seedling, both Triticum species reached a maximum level of colonization harboring 10 6 to 10 7 cells per seedling. No differences could be detected between NI and HKB treated seedlings for both Triticum species. Triticum aestivum cv. ProINTA Federal seedlings reached the maximum growth promotion when roots were colonized {{with a number of}} bacterial cells ranging from 5 · 10 6 to 1. 5 · 10 8 per seedling. Triticum durum cv. Buck Topacio seedlings showed maximum growth promotion when 3. 3 · 10 7 cells were present in their roots. Higher values of colonization showed no <b>growth</b> <b>promoting</b> <b>effects</b> with respect to the controls. It may be concluded that in these experimental conditions the optimum inoculum concentration is 5 · 10 5 cells per seedling for both T. aestivum cv. ProINTA Federal and T. durum cv.

40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed to know the effect of aqueous {{extracts}} of the resurrection plant, Selaginella involvens (Sw.) Spring on spore germination in Pteris argyraea T. Moore and also to know the ameliorating effect of the extracts on UV-Stress during spore germination of Pteris argyraea T. Moore. Based on the present study it is concluded that the extract of Selaginella involvens, shows <b>growth</b> <b>promoting</b> <b>effect</b> by enhancing the spore germination in Pteris argyraea. Both UV and aqueous extracts of Selaginella involvens enhances germination, but the UV stress results in both physical and morphogenetic abnormalities. It is to be noted that in the extract treated spores, the physical abnormalities are in less frequency {{when compared to the}} extract- untreated spores...|$|E
40|$|The hostility between India and Pakistan is {{believed}} to have led to an arms race between the two countries, which might have contributed to their retarded economic growth. This paper investigates this twin problem of arms race and economic growth for the time period 1949 - 2003. The empirical results suggest that there is a mutual causal relationship between the military expenditures of India and Pakistan. Even though military expenditure does not Granger cause economic growth in Pakistan, there is causality from military expenditure to economic growth in India. A VAR analysis revealed that military expenditure hinders economic growth in India in the long-run, but it has a <b>growth</b> <b>promoting</b> <b>effect</b> in the short-run. Military expenditure, Arms race, Growth, India and Pakistan,...|$|E
40|$|Salamander limb {{regeneration}} is a nerve-dependent process. In {{the absence}} of nerves, blastema cells (i. e. cells {{that give rise to}} the new structure) will not proliferate. A major question in regeneration biology is how the nerve exerts its <b>growth</b> <b>promoting</b> <b>effect</b> on blastema cells. To better understand the cellular and molecular signals responsible for growth and pattern formation during regeneration, I have adapted the use organotypic slice culture for axolotl blastemas. Using microarray, I have identified BMP 2 as a possible nerve derived factor responsible for growth and proliferation during regeneration. Here I will demonstrate how organotypic slice cultures are responsive to culture conditions and the candidate neurotrophic factor BMP 2 in both terms of levels of proliferation and gene expression...|$|E
40|$|Germinating {{tests with}} bryophytes were {{undertaken}} with three moss species and two hepatic species. For {{the first time}} these tests were performed with aquaceous extracts of bryophytes in contrast to previous studies in which seeds were directly placed on moist bryophytes. First tests showed an inhibition of the germination rate in 3 species but an increase of the germination in one species. A second study revealed that aquaceous as well as alcoholic extracts in high concentrations inhibited the growth of cress, highly diluted extracts <b>promoted</b> the <b>growth.</b> Other authors found either only germination <b>promoting</b> <b>effects</b> or both, <b>promoting</b> and inhibiting <b>effects.</b> Experiments with compounds extracted from bryophytes cited in the literature had only growth inhibiting effects. Brachythecium rutabulum revealed growth inhibiting effects in a previous but <b>growth</b> <b>promoting</b> <b>effects</b> in this study. The conflicting results are hard to explain and should stimulate further more detailed studies. They maybe due to various combinations of different concentrations of bryophyte extracts, different bryophyte species, different pH and different seeds but also contamination by dust, soil, bacteria and fungi...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of plant}} <b>growth</b> <b>promoting</b> rhizobacteria is {{increasing}} in agriculture and gives an appealing manner to replace chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and dietary supplements. The objective {{of our research}} was to access the plant growth promotion traits of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens and Bacillus subtilis isolated from the maize (Zea mays L.) rhizosphere. In vitro studies showed that isolates {{have the potential to}} produce indole acetic acid (IAA), hydrogen cyanide, phosphate solubilisation, and siderophore. RNA analysis revealed that two isolates were 97 % identical to P. aeruginosa strain DSM 50071 and P. aeruginosa strain NBRC 12689 (AK 20 and AK 31), while two others were 98 % identical to P. fluorescens strain ATCC 13525, P. fluorescens strain IAM 12022 (AK 18 and AK 45) and one other was 99 % identical to B. subtilis strain NCDO 1769 (AK 38). Our gnotobiotic study showed significant differences in plant growth variables under control and inoculated conditions. In the present research, it was observed that the isolated strains had good plant <b>growth</b> <b>promoting</b> <b>effects</b> on rice...|$|R
40|$|The {{greatest}} {{issue affecting}} {{the sustainability of}} broad acre cropping both environmentally and economically is the requirement of fertilizers. These are based on mined phosphorous or other mineral ores, ammonia produced through the Harbour-Bosch process and industrially manufactured potash. As global demand for fertilizers increases, {{the costs associated with}} the production for each of these major nutrients increases. Biofertilizers such as plant <b>growth</b> <b>promoting</b> bacteria (PGPB) are a possible biotechnology that could alleviate the need for addition of increasing amounts of fertilizers. These bacteria naturally occur in soils and aggressively colonize around plant roots and have been shown to have plant <b>growth</b> <b>promoting</b> <b>effects.</b> PGPB are known to influence plant growth by various direct and indirect mechanisms; while some can affect plant physiology directly by mimicking synthesis of plant hormones,others increase mineral availability and nitrogen content in soil. Here we review the previously characterized modes of action for enhancement of plant growth by PGPB such as nitrogen fixation, nutrient solubilization and production of auxins and enzymes, as well as discussing more recent proposed modes of action such as secondary metabolites...|$|R
