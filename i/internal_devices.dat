The barrel {{was connected to}} the breech, and a muzzle brake was fixed to the barrel. A vertical wedge gate was installed in the breech, along with a semi-automatic, free-floating ejector. To ease the loading process, a mechanical loader was placed as well. A ZIS-3 panoramic sight along with an OP1-7 direct-fire sight were needed for firing from closed positions to sighted targets.

50|$|The goal is then {{to design}} a {{competitive}} system in terms of performance that is also as simple as possible. Therefore, the ARTE project was born in order to realize a new payload: Thermal Exchange. The goal is to test heat pipes on board the ISS. The fluids selected are low toxicity fluids: {{this is the reason}} why these fluids can be used inside the Internal Space Station in which astronauts work. At the moment, some heat pipes are currently used on the ISS but they are installed externally because they contain ammonia. If this fluid were used for <b>internal</b> <b>devices,</b> {{in the event of a}} leak it would create a catastrophic hazard to the astronauts. Additionally, a leak could cause a permanent loss of one or more ISS modules.|$|E
40|$|Background: Obstructive {{sleep apnea}} is often {{associated}} with congenital craniofacial malformations due to hypoplastic mandible and decreased pharyngeal airway. In this study, we will compare external and internal distraction devices for mandibular lengthening in terms of effectiveness, results, patient comfort, and complications. Methods: Thirty-seven patients were treated by bilateral mandibular distraction osteogenesis for obstructive sleep apnea: 20 with external and 17 with internal distraction devices. Results: Lengthening of the mandible and increase of the pharyngeal airway were obtained in all patients. Using the external devices, the average mandibular elongation was 30 mm versus 22 mm with the internal devices; however, after 1 year, the results were more stable with <b>internal</b> <b>devices.</b> External devices carried greater risk for pin tract infection than the <b>internal</b> <b>devices</b> (27. 5 % vs 5. 88 %). In addition, pin loosening in 22. 5 % required pin replacement or led to reduced retention period. <b>Internal</b> <b>devices</b> had a precise and predictable vector of lengthening and left less visible scars at the submandibular area but carried the disadvantage of requiring a second operation for device removal. In very young children with severe micrognathia, it was impossible to place <b>internal</b> <b>devices,</b> and external devices were used. Conclusions: <b>Internal</b> <b>devices</b> should be the first choice because they are more comfortable to the patients, more predictable vector of lengthening, are less vulnerable to dislodgement, and leave reduced scarring, with the great disadvantage of second operation for removal. However, external devices still should be considered mainly in severely hypoplastic cases, and the surgeon should be prepared for both options...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Lengthening of the {{mandible}} by distraction osteogenesis {{using an}} <b>internal</b> <b>device</b> {{is the preferred}} method {{for the treatment of}} hemifacial microsomia. Despite its advantages, this technique can lead to various complications after the surgery. Presentation of case: We report the case of an 8 -yr-old Japanese girl whose case presented practical difficulties in device activation because of rod unaccessible pain after the initial mandibular distraction with an <b>internal</b> <b>device,</b> and this complication was addressed with the installation of an original sleeve. Discussion: In the present patient, the region of the bend rod was located at the inferior border of the right mandible, causing rod unaccessible pain by contacting the surrounding tissue including a sensory nerve. Careful vertical ramus distractor position planning and tools to resolve complications are the key factors for accomplishing the scheduled elongation. Conclusion: Alternative techniques using a sleeve for safer and gentle distraction for rod unaccessible pain on activation should be considered...|$|R

40|$|Craniosynostosis is a {{relatively}} rare congenital deformity in which {{one or more of}} the cranial sutures have closed prematurely. Premature fusion of one of the coronal sutures results in plagio-cephaly, which is a common deformity in craniomax-illofacial surgery that can be associated with many complications affecting sensory, respiratory, and neu-rological function. 1 Different surgical procedures have been considered in the treatment of synostosis. Suturectomy (strip cra-niectomy) and sutural distraction osteogenesis (SDO) are widely used. 2 – 5 In particular, during suturectomy, the prematurely fused suture line is reopened, permit-ting brain growth and cerebral decompression but not the reshaping of the dysmorphic skull; on the other hand, gradual SDO helps in reshaping the skull with-out leaving any subcranial dead space. 5 Distraction methods include both external and in-ternal devices. The external devices require a frame that is attached to the skull and permit to control and modify the vectors and forces during activation. They are easier to apply and simpler to remove, but its bulk can result in physical and psychosocial discomfort for the patient. On the contrary, <b>internal</b> <b>devices</b> are small-er with better patient acceptance but require an addi-tional surgical access for removal. So, <b>internal</b> <b>devices</b> have a specific indication in patients under school age, whereas external devices should probably be preferred in adolescents and adult patients because they offer easier implantation and better control of the vectors and assure more predictable and effective results. 3, 6, 7 Here, we present the case of a young infant patient with a clear synostosis of the left coronal suture, which was treated by piezoelectric suturec-tomy combined with SDO...|$|E
