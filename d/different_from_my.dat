500|$|On the {{direction}} of the film, Selick reflected, [...] "It's as though he [...] laid the egg, and I sat on it and hatched it. He wasn't involved in a hands-on way, but his hand is in it. It was my job {{to make it look like}} 'a Tim Burton film', which is not so <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> own films." [...] When asked on Burton's involvement, Selick claimed, [...] "I don't want to take away from Tim, but he was not in San Francisco when we made it. He came up five times over two years, and spent no more than eight or ten days in total." [...] Walt Disney Feature Animation contributed with some use of second-layering traditional animation. Burton found production somewhat difficult because he was directing Batman Returns and in pre-production of Ed Wood.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, Gould {{published}} The Structure of Evolutionary Theory (2002), a long treatise recapitulating {{his version of}} modern evolutionary theory. In episode 13 of the Dutch TV series Of Beauty and Consolation Gould remarked, [...] "In {{a couple of years}} I will be able to gather in one volume my view of how evolution works. It is to me a great consolation because it represents the putting together of a lifetime of thinking into one source. That book will never be particularly widely read. It's going to be far too long, and it's only for a few thousand professionals—very <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> popular science writings—but it is of greater consolation to me because it is a chance to put into one place a whole way of thinking about evolution that I've struggled with all my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Stevenson {{described}} {{the character of}} Marion as [...] "cranky, stubborn and lonely", saying that living alone has made her [...] "become quite idiotic and eccentric". When the character of April arrives, Stevenson explains that [...] "Marion has to go from nought to 80 in terms of parenting. There are lots of reasons she wouldn't get it right" [...] which leads on to the guilt and anxiety that Marion suffers when April runs away. Stevenson compared her own difficulties of parenting to Marion's, saying [...] "it is easier for me than someone like Marion because I have had 14 years experience". Richards spoke {{of the character of}} April, saying that [...] "the residential schools and children's homes were completely <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> life. [...] doesn't feel connected to anybody and she struggles to know who she is".|$|E

500|$|.....of [...] that I have read, the {{negative}} ones often {{say something to}} the effect that the book is just like the game, so why read it? What those readers may not realize is that I was hired to novelize the game. That means taking the game and turning it into a book [...] or, put another way, I did what I was hired to do. ...there must be some folks who feel that I wrote the Chief out of character. That's news to me. All I {{can tell you is that}} the Bungie folks, who care deeply about the character and the universe never raised that issue, and approved the book as written. However, there's no doubt that every author is different, and will approach characters differently. So if Nylund's rendition of the Chief is <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> own in subtle ways that would be understandable.|$|E
500|$|Although {{she worked}} well into her seventh month, Cardinale's {{pregnancy}} was kept a tight secret. Tormented by thoughts of suicide, {{she fell into}} a state of depression. When she thought she could no longer hide her condition, she asked Cristaldi to terminate her contract. Understanding her predicament, he sent her to London for the birth, far away from the press. He simply explained that she had gone to England to learn English for a film. Cristaldi told Cardinale not to reveal her condition as she would be betraying the public and it would put an end to her career. So as to maintain the secret, he drew up a detailed American-style contract covering every little detail of her life, depriving her of any possibility of acting on her own behalf. Cardinale explained: [...] "I was no longer master of my own body or thoughts. Even talking with a friend about anything that could make me look <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> public image was risky, {{as if it had been}} publicized, I would have been in trouble. Everything was in the hands of Vides". For seven years, Cardinale kept her secret, not only from the public, but also from her own son, Patrick, who grew up in the family with her parents and sister more or less as a brother until the day Enzo Biagi, a journalist, discovered the truth. After Cardinale decided to tell him everything, he published her story in [...] Oggi and L'Europeo.|$|E
2500|$|Late in 2010, Nina {{revealed}} {{that she was}} recording a studio album set for release in mid-January 2011. It was originally set {{to be the first}} of her two-album recording deal with her new label, Universal Records. After a couple of push-backs, Stay Alive was finally released on November 19, 2011. In choosing such title for the album, she explained, [...] "It's like some people are saying that I'm gone [...] So I’m here to say that I’m still here and staying alive." [...] She called the album [...] "special" [...] {{due to the fact that}} she contributed from its musical production to the cover art design." [...] Stay Alive was a universal acclaim, being called [...] "futuristic and edgy" [...] by critics who also predicted that it [...] "may set new trends in Filipino music," [...] tagging Nina as the new [...] "dance diva." [...] Philippine Entertainment Portal praised the album, stating [...] "Stay Alive is a testament to Nina's evolution as an artist and determination to be a better performer." [...] "Dance" [...] was released on October 6, 2011 as the lead single from the album. Nina explained, [...] "The carrier single is a dance song for it to be <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> previous albums." [...] The song is described as [...] "an upbeat track with a catchy melody." [...] Its music video was released on December 9, and features Nina in Gaga-ish costumes while performing a dance routine. Due to lack of promotion, the song failed to achieve commercial success. On January 30, 2012, [...] "However Much Love" [...] was released as a radio-only pre-Valentine single. The song was critically acclaimed, being called a [...] "standout" [...] by Abby Mendoza of Philippine Entertainment Portal. It also performed well commercially, becoming Nina's first chart-topper since 2008. On February 13, she staged a pre-Valentine concert entitled Update Your Status... at the Music Museum, which supported the album. In the same month, she expressed disappointment with the album's lack of promotion, saying [...] " [...] always have a meeting, but no actions are initiated. They give us schedules that are not really followed. When it's already okay, then they cancel it." [...] On April 14, she staged another concert at the Music Museum, entitled Timeless: Tribute to a Diva, which was dedicated to late pop diva Whitney Houston. [...] "Believe in the Dream" [...] was released on April 24, 2012 as the third single from Stay Alive, accompanied by a lyric video.|$|E

Sparks stated, [...] "It's going to be <b>different</b> <b>from</b> what <b>my</b> fans have heard before. With (2009's) 'Battlefield' it was pop/rock {{and a little bit}} of pop/R&B, but I'm going for more of the R&B side now, so it's like R&B/pop instead of pop/R&B." ...|$|R

40|$|In {{reflecting}} on {{the record of the}} World Trade Organization during its first ten years of existence I have chosen to take a political view. In doing so, I am aware that other observers might well draw quite <b>different</b> conclusions <b>from</b> <b>my</b> own. However, it is often the political perceptions that count. Indeed, in the past few years, as the WTO has gained recognition in the public consciousness, the work of the institution has sometimes been deflected from what strict economic or legal analysis might suggest as the best courses for the overall public good. ...|$|R
5000|$|A key {{breakthrough}} in his attitude to art was witnessing {{the performance of}} Tinguely's Homage to Modern Art in Basel, 1961. The work profoundly impressed Roth, leading to a decisive break with constructivism into post-modern avant-garde practices associated with the Nouveaux Réalistes such as Tinguely and Arman, and the group of artists that were about to become known as Fluxus, including Joseph Beuys and Nam June Paik. It Homage to Modern Art was simply a completely <b>different</b> world <b>from</b> <b>my</b> Constructivism, {{it was something like}} a paradise that I'd lost.|$|R

The mechanisms/abilities {{of agents}} {{compared}} to the emergent outcomes in three <b>different</b> scenarios <b>from</b> <b>my</b> past work is summarised: the El Farol Game; an Artificial Stock Market; and the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma. Within each of these, {{the presence or absence}} of some different agent abilities was examined, the results being summarised here – some turning out to be necessary, some not. The ability in terms of the recognition of other agents, either by characteristics or by name is a recurring theme. Some of the difficulties in reaching a systematic understanding of these connections is briefly discussed. ...|$|R
