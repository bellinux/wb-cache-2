50|$|Rennet {{derived from}} animal slaughter, and thus cheese <b>made</b> with animal-derived <b>rennet,</b> is not vegetarian. Most widely {{available}} vegetarian cheeses are <b>made</b> using <b>rennet</b> produced by fermentation of the fungus Mucor miehei. Vegans and other dairy-avoiding vegetarians {{do not eat}} conventional cheese, but some vegetable-based cheese substitutes (soy or almond) are used as substitutes.|$|R
50|$|Strict {{followers}} of the dietary laws of Islam and Judaism must avoid cheeses <b>made</b> with <b>rennet</b> from animals not slaughtered in a manner adhering to halal or kosher laws. Both faiths allow cheese <b>made</b> with vegetable-based <b>rennet</b> or with <b>rennet</b> <b>made</b> from animals that were processed in a halal or kosher manner. Many less orthodox Jews also believe that rennet undergoes enough processing to change its nature entirely and do not consider it to ever violate kosher law. (See Cheese and kashrut.) As cheese is a dairy food, under kosher rules it cannot be eaten in the same meal with any meat.|$|R
5000|$|Curd size is {{the size}} of the chunks in the cottage cheese. The two major types of cottage cheese are small-curd, high-acid cheese <b>made</b> without <b>rennet,</b> and large-curd, low-acid cheese <b>made</b> with <b>rennet.</b> Rennet is a natural complex of enzymes that speeds {{curdling}} and keeps the curd that forms from breaking up. Adding rennet shortens the cheese-making process, resulting in a lower acid and larger curd cheese, and reduces the amount of curd poured off with leftover liquid (whey). [...] Sometimes large-curd cottage cheese is called [...] "chunk style." ...|$|R

50|$|From May 1, 2007, many Mars {{products}} {{made in the}} UK became unsuitable for vegetarians. The company {{announced that it would}} be using whey <b>made</b> with animal <b>rennet</b> (material from a calf's stomach lining, and a byproduct of veal), instead of using <b>rennet</b> <b>made</b> by microorganisms, in products including Mars, Twix, Snickers, Maltesers, Bounty, Minstrels and Milky Way. The response from many consumers, particularly the Vegetarian Society's request for UK vegetarians to register their protests with Mars, generated extensive press and caused the company to abandon the plans shortly thereafter. Mars switched to all-vegetarian sources in the UK.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the use of hygienised kid rennet pastes in model cheese systems and also in goat milk semi-hard cheeses to promote lipolysis. The results obtained indicated {{that the use of}} rennet paste caused greater lipolysis and increased, mostly, the short-chain free fatty acid (FFA) content. The model systems made with whole goat's milk using rennet paste and commercial rennet mixture exhibited a higher FFA content than did the rennet paste-free controls (31, 600 vs. 25, 600 μmol/kg cheese). For the pilot cheeses <b>made</b> with bovine <b>rennet</b> and rennet paste mixture, the increase in FFA level after 45 days of ripening compared with the cheeses prepared only with commercial rennet was as much as 6600 (μmol/kg cheese) and the increase in the butyric acid content was also 1650 (μmol/kg cheese). Moreover, after 15 days of ripening, industrially prepared cheeses <b>made</b> with <b>rennet</b> paste exhibited greater levels of FFA than did the cheeses <b>made</b> with commercial <b>rennet</b> (11, 500 μmol/kg at 45 days of ripening). Their flavour was stronger and the organoleptic characteristics were better accepted, which implies less ripening time for commercial cheese manufacture. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
