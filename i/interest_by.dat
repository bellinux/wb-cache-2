In two articles published in Tilloch's Philosophical Journal in January and February 1814, Accum described the iodine content of different kinds of seaweed and gave a detailed account of a process for iodine production.|$|E
5|$|The banker Charles Rothschild devoted much of {{his time}} to entomology, {{creating}} a large collection of fleas now in the Rothschild Collection at the Natural History Museum, London. He discovered and named the plague vector flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, also known as the oriental rat flea, in 1903. Using what was probably the world's most complete collection of fleas of about 260,000 specimens (representing some 73% of the 2,587 species and subspecies so far described), he described around 500 species and subspecies of Siphonaptera. He was followed in this <b>interest</b> <b>by</b> his daughter Miriam Rothschild, who helped to catalogue his enormous collection of the insects in seven volumes.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two main}} rock types on the Mendips: the Devonian {{sandstones}} visible around Blackdown and Downhead and the Carboniferous Limestones, which dominate the hills and surround the older rock formations. There are nine active quarries {{and a host of}} disused sites, several of which have been designated as geological Sites of Special Scientific <b>Interest</b> <b>by</b> English Nature. Because of the effect quarrying has on the environment and local communities, a campaign has been started to halt the creation of any new quarries and to restrict the activities and expansion of the existing ones.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Battleship Division Nine's {{time with}} the Grand Fleet, combating boredom was a {{constant}} difficulty. Located at the northeastern tip of Scotland, the islands surrounding Scapa Flow {{were little more than}} barren, cold, windswept specks of land devoid of the trappings of civilization. Due to the efforts of the officers to keep their men entertained, however, morale remained high throughout the war. The British worked hard to turn the anchorage into a more inviting place. Central to these efforts were sporting events. The Fleet held numerous inter-ship competitions, including soccer, rugby, rowing, track, and boxing, which were followed with intense <b>interest</b> <b>by</b> the men of the respective ships.|$|E

5|$|While {{studying}} naturally fluorescing minerals in 1896, the French physicist Henri Becquerel {{discovered that}} they emitted radiation without any exposure to an external energy source. These radioactive materials {{became the subject of}} much <b>interest</b> <b>by</b> scientists, including the New Zealand physicist Ernest Rutherford who discovered they emitted particles. He designated these particles alpha and beta, {{on the basis of their}} ability to penetrate matter. In 1900, Becquerel showed that the beta rays emitted by radium could be deflected by an electric field, and that their mass-to-charge ratio was the same as for cathode rays. This evidence strengthened the view that electrons existed as components of atoms.|$|E
5|$|Bonneau {{came off}} the bench in {{the start of his}} {{freshman}} season for the SUNY Orange Colts, but he eventually was the team's leading scorer with 16.5 points and 1.9 steals per game, also averaging 3.8 rebounds and 2.6 assists per game. He had to sit out his sophomore season due to academic reasons. As a junior, he broke his wrist in training to miss the first six weeks of the season. Bonneau recognized that sitting out was of benefit to both his academic habits and his game. In 19 games with the Colts he averaged 30.9 points, 6.3 rebounds, 2.5 assists and 1.6 steals per game. After his second season at SUNY Orange, Bonneau drew <b>interest</b> <b>by</b> NCAA Division I colleges Providence and St. John's, but {{he was not able to}} enroll due to academic reasons.|$|E
5|$|Closely {{linked to}} the mercantile community, he {{actively}} supported trade promotion schemes and invested in the Muscovy Company and the Levant Company. He supported the attempts of John Davis and Martin Frobisher to discover the Northwest Passage and exploit the mineral resources of Labrador, and encouraged Humphrey Gilbert's exploration of Newfoundland. Gilbert's voyage was largely financed by recusant Catholics and Walsingham favoured the scheme as a potential means of removing Catholics from England by encouraging emigration to the New World. Walsingham was among the promoters of Francis Drake's profitable 1578–1581 circumnavigation of the world, correctly judging that Spanish possessions in the Pacific were vulnerable to attack. The venture was calculated to promote the Protestant <b>interest</b> <b>by</b> embarrassing and weakening the Spanish, {{as well as to}} seize Spanish treasure. The first edition of Richard Hakluyt's Principal Navigation, Voyages and Discoveries of the English Nation was dedicated to Walsingham.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Korean War, {{a number}} of {{aircraft}} companies in both Europe and America separately decided to investigate the prospective of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, which would eliminate the requirement for vulnerable runways by taking off and landing vertically as opposed to the conventional horizontal approach. In addition to military applications, the prospect of applying such technology to commercial airliners was also viewed with considerable <b>interest</b> <b>by</b> the mid 1950s, thus the value of developing viable vertical take-off systems was judged to be substantial. However, even during this era, few companies had envisioned that a VTOL aircraft would also be realistically compatible with the characteristics of high performance military aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In 1221, Jacques de Vitry, Bishop of Acre, {{returned}} from the disastrous Fifth Crusade with good news: King David of India, the son or grandson of Prester John, had mobilized his armies against the Saracens. He had already conquered Persia, then under the Khwarezmian Empire's control, and was moving on towards Baghdad as well. This descendant of the great king who had defeated the Seljuks in 1141 planned to reconquer and rebuild Jerusalem. Controversial Soviet historian and ethnologist Lev Gumilev speculated that the much reduced crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem in the Levant resuscitated this legend {{in order to raise}} Christian hopes and to persuade European monarchs who had lost <b>interest</b> <b>by</b> that time in getting involved in costly crusades in a distant region that was far removed from their own states and affairs.|$|E
5|$|In 1895 and 1896 {{the ruins}} at Abydos, Tukh, Hierakonpolis and Gebelein were excavated. In 1892 Jacques de Morgan, Director of Antiquities in Egypt, proved that pottery found at Abydos and Nakadah pre-dated the dynastic period, {{stimulating}} <b>interest</b> <b>by</b> many European Archaeologists. As each excavation was completed, local Egyptian residents {{would continue to}} search the sites for remains. In 1895 E. A. Wallis Budge, {{on behalf of the}} British Museum, procured inscribed coffins and funerary furniture from the 12th Dynasty tombs at Al-Barshah by working with the Egyptian Service of Antiquities. Budge started purchasing predynastic finds from the locals including bowls, spear and arrow heads, carved flint and bone figures and partial human remains (described as chiefly bones without skin or flesh remaining).|$|E

5|$|In {{a lecture}} given in 1884 to the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters Dr. Henrik Mohn, {{one of the}} founders of modern meteorology, argued that the finding of the Jeannette relics {{indicated}} the existence of an ocean current flowing from east to west across the entire Arctic Ocean. The Danish governor of Julianehaab, writing of the find, surmised that an expedition frozen into the Siberian sea might, if its ship were to prove strong enough, cross the polar ocean and land in South Greenland. These theories were read with <b>interest</b> <b>by</b> the 23-year-old Fridtjof Nansen, then working as a curator at the Bergen Museum while completing his doctoral studies. Nansen was already captivated by the frozen north; two years earlier he had experienced a four-month voyage on the sealer Viking, which had included three weeks trapped in drifting ice. An expert skier, Nansen was making plans to lead the first crossing of the Greenland icecap, an objective delayed by the demands of his academic studies, but triumphantly achieved in 1888–89. Through these years Nansen remembered the east–west Arctic drift theory and its inherent possibilities for further polar exploration, and shortly after his return from Greenland he was ready to announce his plans.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the siege}} of Berat {{continued}} through the winter of 1280/1281. By early December, the Angevin forces had seized a number of outlying forts around the city and penetrated its suburbs. Charles, however, remained anxious to take the city before the Byzantine relief force arrived. He ordered his governors in Albania to direct all their resources towards the siege, and displayed his close <b>interest</b> <b>by</b> a series of letters to Sully, instructing {{him to take the}} city by assault if necessary. The Byzantine force advanced cautiously, and arrived in the area in early spring 1281. The megas domestikos Tarchaneiotes avoided a direct confrontation and relied on ambushes and raids instead. He also managed to resupply the besieged fortress with provisions, which were loaded onto rafts and then left to float down the river Osum which flows by the citadel.|$|E
5|$|The case {{established}} {{the doctrine of}} fair abridgement, which allowed that abridgements displaying {{a fair amount of}} labour {{on the part of the}} editor, and that differed from the original published work in a significant way, could not be copyright violations. This in effect raised the abridger to the level of an author. The decision did not define the exact parameters that would qualify a work as a valid abridgement. This distinction came with a later case involving an abridgement of Hawksworth's Voyages, in a decision written by Lord Chancellor Apsley. This concept of fair abridgement eventually evolved through common law, initiated from Gyles v Wilcox, into the current concept of fair use. Hardwicke's decision also added the exercise of personal judgement to the list of admissible defences against the charge of copyright infringement, adding to the growing case law establishing that British copyright would be based on labour and not on originality. The opinion advanced the position that copyright law should serve the public <b>interest</b> <b>by</b> promoting the creation of new educational and useful works, rather than focusing on publishing rights. The case played a significant role in the development of English copyright law. The United States federal courts have cited the case as recently as the 1980s.|$|E
