5|$|The {{increased}} osmolal gap {{is caused}} by the ethylene <b>glycol</b> itself. As the metabolism of ethylene <b>glycol</b> progresses there will be less ethylene <b>glycol</b> and this will decrease the blood ethylene <b>glycol</b> concentration and the osmolal gap making this test less useful. Additionally, the presence of other alcohols such as ethanol, isopropanol, or methanol or conditions such as alcoholic or diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, or kidney failure may also produce an elevated osmolal gap leading to a false diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|As {{many of the}} {{clinical}} {{signs and symptoms of}} ethylene <b>glycol</b> poisoning are nonspecific and occur in many poisonings the diagnosis is often difficult. It is most reliably diagnosed by the measurement of the blood ethylene <b>glycol</b> concentration. Ethylene <b>glycol</b> in biological fluids can be determined by gas chromatography. Many hospital laboratories do not have the ability to perform this blood test {{and in the absence of}} this test the diagnosis must be made based on {{the clinical}} presentation of the patient. In this situation a helpful test to diagnose poisoning is the measurement of the osmolal gap. The patients' serum osmolality is measured by freezing point depression and then compared with the predicted osmolality based on the patients' measured sodium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, and any ethanol that may have been ingested. The presence of a large osmolal gap supports a diagnosis of ethylene <b>glycol</b> poisoning. However, a normal osmolar gap does not rule out ethylene <b>glycol</b> exposure because of wide individual variability.|$|E
5|$|Ethylene <b>glycol</b> {{has a low}} vapor pressure; it {{does not}} {{evaporate}} readily at normal temperatures and therefore high concentrations in air or intoxication are unlikely to occur following inhalational exposures. There may be a slight risk of poisoning where mists or fogs are generated, although this rarely leads to poisoning as ethylene <b>glycol</b> causes irritation and coughing when breathed in, alerting victims to its presence. Ethylene <b>glycol</b> is not well absorbed through skin meaning poisoning following dermal exposure is also uncommon.|$|E
40|$|Cytosine <b>glycols</b> (5, 6 -dihydroxy- 5, 6 -dihydrocytosine) are initial {{products}} of cytosine oxidation. Because {{these products are}} not stable, virtually all biological {{studies have focused on}} the stable oxidation {{products of}} cytosine, including 5 -hydroxycytosine, uracil <b>glycols</b> and 5 -hydroxyuracil. Previously, we reported that the lifetime of cytosine <b>glycols</b> was greatly enhanced in double-stranded DNA, thus implicating these products in DNA repair and mutagenesis. In the present work, cytosine and uracil <b>glycols</b> were generated in double-stranded alternating co-polymers by oxidation with KMnO 4. The half-life of cytosine <b>glycols</b> in poly(dG-dC) was 6. 5 h giving a ratio of dehydration to deamination of 5 : 1. At high substrate concentrations, the excision of cytosine <b>glycols</b> from poly(dG-dC) by purified endonuclease III was comparable to that of uracil <b>glycols,</b> whereas the excision of these substrates was 5 -fold greater than that of 5 -hydroxycytosine. Kinetic studies revealed that the Vmax was several fold higher for the excision of cytosine <b>glycols</b> compared to 5 -hydroxycytosine. In contrast to cytosine <b>glycols,</b> uracil <b>glycols</b> did not undergo detectable dehydration to 5 -hydroxyuracil. Replacing poly(dG-dC) for poly(dI-dC) gave similar results with respect to the lifetime and excision of cytosine <b>glycols.</b> This work demonstrates the formation of cytosine <b>glycols</b> in DNA and their removal by base excision repair...|$|R

40|$|We {{employed}} {{thermal diffusion}} forced Rayleigh scattering (TDFRS) {{to investigate the}} chain length dependence of the thermal diffusion behavior of short <b>glycols</b> in ethanol. We studied three <b>glycols,</b> monoethylenglycol (MEG), diethylenglycol (DEG) and triethylenglycol (TEG), in an ethanol solution. In contrast to the polymer polyethylenglycol, the shorter <b>glycols</b> used {{within the framework of}} this study are completely soluble in ethanol, at least for low molar fractions. In order to guarantee a good solubility of the <b>glycols,</b> the measurements were limited to molar fractions of 10 % and 20 %. As the different <b>glycols</b> only differ by their chain length {{it will be possible to}} deduce its influence on the thermal diffusion properties. Due to the fairly short persistence length of the <b>glycols,</b> D(T) reaches already for the dimer a plateau value. This finding agrees with simulation results. Furthermore, the thermal expansion and the kinematic viscosity are measured to investigate if empirical correlations seen for other systems could be confirmed...|$|R
5|$|Ethylene <b>glycol</b> {{poisoning}} is {{a relatively}} common occurrence worldwide. Human poisoning often occurs in isolated cases, but may also occur in epidemics. Many cases of poisoning {{are the result of}} using ethylene <b>glycol</b> as a cheap substitute for alcohol or intentional ingestions in suicide attempts. Less commonly it {{has been used as a}} means of homicide. Children or animals may be exposed by accidental ingestion; children and animals often consume large amounts due to ethylene <b>glycol</b> having a sweet taste. In the United States there were 5816 cases reported to poison centers in 2002. Additionally, ethylene <b>glycol</b> was the most common chemical responsible for deaths reported by US poison centers in 2003. In Australia there were 17 cases reported to the Victorian poison center and 30 cases reported to the New South Wales poison center in 2007. However, these numbers may underestimate actual numbers because not all cases attributable to ethylene <b>glycol</b> are reported to poison control centers. Most deaths from ethylene <b>glycol</b> are intentional suicides; deaths in children due to unintentional ingestion are extremely rare.|$|E
5|$|Ethylene <b>glycol</b> {{poisoning}} is poisoning {{caused by}} drinking ethylene <b>glycol.</b> Early symptoms include intoxication, vomiting and abdominal pain. Later symptoms may include a decreased level of consciousness, headache, and seizures. Long term outcomes may include kidney failure and brain damage. Toxicity and death may occur even after drinking a small amount.|$|E
5|$|Most acetate esters, however, are {{produced}} from acetaldehyde using the Tishchenko reaction. In addition, ether acetates {{are used as}} solvents for nitrocellulose, acrylic lacquers, varnish removers, and wood stains. First, <b>glycol</b> monoethers {{are produced}} from ethylene oxide or propylene oxide with alcohol, which are then esterified with acetic acid. The three major products are ethylene <b>glycol</b> monoethyl ether acetate (EEA), ethylene <b>glycol</b> monobutyl ether acetate (EBA), and propylene <b>glycol</b> monomethyl ether acetate (PMA, more commonly known as PGMEA in semiconductor manufacturing processes, where it {{is used as a}} resist solvent). This application consumes about 15% to 20% of worldwide acetic acid. Ether acetates, for example EEA, {{have been shown to be}} harmful to human reproduction.|$|E
50|$|Cytosine <b>glycols</b> are {{intermediate}} unstable {{products of}} cytosine oxidation. These, in turn, {{are thought to}} undergo deamination to uracil <b>glycols,</b> dehydration to 5-hydroxycytosine, or both deamination and dehydration to 5-hydroxyuracil.|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{generation}} of reactive oxygen species during the metabolism of a carcinogen, benzo[a]pyrene, by human mammary epithelial cells. We have quantitated the production of one type of oxidative DNA damage, thymine <b>glycols,</b> by using a monoclonal antibody specific to this base modification. Thymine <b>glycols</b> were produced in DNA in a dose-dependent manner after exposure of human mammary epithelial cells to benzo[a]pyrene. The number of thymine <b>glycols</b> formed in the DNA {{was similar to that}} of 7, 8 -dihydroxy- 9, 10 -epoxy- 7, 8, 9, 10 -tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene covalently bound to the DNA. Exposure of cells to the carcinogen in the presence of superoxide dismutase, which reduces superoxide anions, inhibited the production of thymine <b>glycols</b> and increased cell survival but had little effect on adduct formation. At equitoxic doses, approximately equal to 10 -fold more thymine <b>glycols</b> were formed after exposure to benzo[a]pyrene than to gamma-irradiation. Thymine <b>glycols,</b> produced by either agent, were efficiently removed from the DNA of the cells. Since thymine <b>glycols</b> represent only a portion of the oxidative damage possibly produced, our results indicate that the total amount of oxidative damage induced during the exposure of human mammary epithelial cells to benzo[a]pyrene greatly exceeds the amount produced by direct adduct formation and that this indirect damage {{plays an important role in}} the cytotoxicity of benzo[a]pyrene...|$|R
50|$|IBX {{is notable}} for {{oxidizing}} vicinal diols (or <b>glycols)</b> to diketones without cleavage of the carbon-carbon bond, but oxidative cleavage of <b>glycols</b> to two aldehydes or ketones can occur when modified conditions are used (elevated temperatures or trifluoroacetic acid solvent).|$|R
5|$|De-icers spray heated {{de-icing}} fluid, often propylene <b>glycol</b> or ethylene <b>glycol,</b> onto icy surfaces such as {{the bodies}} of aircraft and road surfaces. These prevent ice from forming {{on the body of}} the aircraft while on the ground. Ice makes the surface of the wings rougher, reducing the amount of lift they provide while increasing drag. The ice also increases the weight of the aircraft and can affect its balance.|$|E
5|$|Due to incompatibilities, it is {{recommended}} to keep acetic acid away from chromic acid, ethylene <b>glycol,</b> nitric acid, perchloric acid, permanganates, peroxides and hydroxyls.|$|E

In 2003, he {{came up with the idea}} of using a piezoelectric ultrasound-emitting element to vaporise a pressurized jet of liquid containing nicotine diluted in a propylene <b>glycol</b> solution.This design produces a smoke-like vapour that can be inhaled and provides a vehicle for nicotine delivery into the bloodstream via the lungs. He also proposed using propylene <b>glycol</b> to dilute nicotine and placing it in a disposable plastic cartridge which serves as a liquid reservoir and mouthpiece.|$|E
40|$|Several <b>glycols</b> and Tweens {{markedly}} {{stimulated the}} production of ergot alkaloids in submerged cultures of Claviceps paspali. The role of these compounds was investigated in shake flasks and bench-scale fermentors. 2, 3 -Butanediol was not utilized by the fungus, and 1, 2 -propanediol- 1 - 14 C was not incorporated into the alkaloids. <b>Glycols</b> and Tweens lowered the surface tension of the basal medium and promoted the utilization of metabolites. In the presence of <b>glycols</b> and Tweens, an increased uptake of labeled sorbitol and succinic acid took place, whereas the specific radioactivity of the alkaloids was not affected. These results indicated that <b>glycols</b> and Tweens are not involved directly in the biosynthetic process; they apparently acted as surface-active agents, facilitating transport of metabolites into the cells...|$|R
5000|$|Cyclodextrins (CDs) {{have been}} {{extensively}} studied as host molecules (ring) in polyrotaxanes. The poly(ethylene <b>glycol)s</b> can assemble with α-CDs {{to form a}} molecular necklace.

The models confirm that the distance of form zig-zag structure of repeat units corresponds {{to the size of}} cavity in α-CDs. This is a classical example of [...] "template threadings" [...] which also explains why poly(ethylene <b>glycol)s</b> are not able to form rotaxanes with β-CD.|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} and microbiological hydrolyses of epoxide compounds of acetylene series have been comparatively carried out. It {{has been shown}} that as distinguished from chemical one in microbiological hydrolysis along with corresponding optically active <b>glycols,</b> ketoalcohols of acetylene series are also formed. It has been also defined that the synthesized <b>glycols</b> of acetylene series have bactericide properties related to sulfate-reducing bacteria at concentration of 100 - 200 mg/l.

5|$|Ethylene <b>glycol</b> {{has been}} shown to be toxic to humans and is also toxic to {{domestic}} pets such as cats and dogs. A toxic dose requiring medical treatment varies but is considered more than 0.1 mL per kg body weight (mL/kg) of pure substance. That is roughly 16 mL of 50% ethylene <b>glycol</b> for an 80kg adult and 4 mL for a 20kg child. Poison control centers often use more than a lick or taste in a child or more than a mouthful in an adult as a dose requiring hospital assessment.|$|E
5|$|Ethylene <b>glycol</b> is a colorless, odorless, sweet liquid, {{commonly}} found in antifreeze. It may be drunk accidentally or purposefully {{in an attempt to}} cause death. When broken down by the body it results in glycolic acid and oxalic acid which cause most of the toxicity. The diagnosis may be suspected when calcium oxalate crystals are seen in the urine or when acidosis or an increased osmol gap is present in the blood. Diagnosis may be confirmed by measuring ethylene <b>glycol</b> levels in the blood; however, many hospitals do not have the ability to perform this test.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to antidotes, an important treatment for poisoning {{is the use}} of hemodialysis. Hemodialysis is used to enhance the removal of unmetabolized ethylene <b>glycol,</b> as well as its metabolites from the body. It {{has been shown to be}} highly effective in the removal of ethylene <b>glycol</b> and its metabolites from the blood. Hemodialysis also has the added benefit of correcting other metabolic derangements or supporting deteriorating kidney function. Hemodialysis is usually indicated in patients with severe metabolic acidosis (blood pH less than 7.3), kidney failure, severe electrolyte imbalance, or if the patient's condition is deteriorating despite treatment. Often both antidotal treatment and hemodialysis are used together in the treatment of poisoning. Because hemodialysis will also remove the antidotes from the blood, doses of antidotes need to be increased to compensate. If hemodialysis is not available, then peritoneal dialysis also removes ethylene <b>glycol,</b> although less efficiently.|$|E
30|$|Very recently, aqueous {{suspensions}} of SWCNH {{have been}} studied in view of this possible use [38]. However, in solar thermal collectors, water is often replaced by <b>glycols</b> or water/glycol mixtures, to protect against freeze damage and/or to increase the temperature for high temperature solar collectors, since <b>glycols</b> have lower freezing point and higher boiling point with respect to water.|$|R
40|$|The genetic {{requirements}} for the excision repair of thymine <b>glycols,</b> urea residues, and apurinic (AP) sites were examined by measuring the survival in Escherichia coli mutants of phi X 174 replicative form (RF) I transfecting DNA containing selectively introduced lesions. phi X RF I DNA containing thymine <b>glycols</b> was inactivated at a greater rate in mutants deficient in endonuclease III (nth) than in wild-type hosts, suggesting that endonuclease III {{is involved in the}} repair of thymine <b>glycols</b> in vivo. phi X RF I DNA containing thymine <b>glycols</b> was also inactivated at a greater rate in mutants that were deficient in both exonuclease III and endonuclease IV (xth nfo) than in wild-type hosts, suggesting that a class II AP endonuclease is required for the in vivo processing of thymine <b>glycols.</b> phi X duplex-transfecting DNA containing urea residues or AP sites was inactivated at a greater rate in xth nfo double mutants than in wild-type, but not single-mutant, hosts, suggesting that exonuclease III or endonuclease IV is required for the repair of these damages and that either activity can substitute for the other. These data are in agreement with the known in vitro substrate specificities of endonuclease III, exonuclease III, and endonuclease IV...|$|R

Large new airports {{may be required to}} collect 60 percent of aircraft deicing fluid after deicing. Airports that discharge the collected aircraft deicing fluid directly to waters of the U.S. must also meet numeric discharge requirements for chemical oxygen demand. A report in 2000 stated that ethylene <b>glycol</b> was becoming less popular for aircraft deicing in the U.S., due to its reporting requirements and adverse environmental impacts (p.213), and noted a shift to the use of propylene <b>glycol</b> (p.I-3).|$|E
