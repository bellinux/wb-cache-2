40|$|Mechanosensation {{requires}} the transduction of mechanical stimuli into neuronal impulses. It encompasses {{not only the}} sense of touch but also proprioception and hearing. In contrast to sight, smell and taste, relatively {{little is known about}} the molecular machinery of mechanosensation. It is already clear, however, that important aspects are conserved across phyla, from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans. Drosophila melanogaster is well placed to make a significant contribution to this field. Its advantages include a sequenced genome allied with powerful genetic techniques, and the ability to conduct electrophysiological recording from mechanoreceptor neurons. For human geneticists, it is expected that Drosophila studies will provide a source of candidate genes whose human homologues can be examined for roles in mechanosensory development, function and disease. ANATOMY OF MECHANOSENSATION As an arthropod, Drosophila has a tough, mechanically resistant exoskeleton, which is not conducive to sensation of touch, and so this modality is largely detected via a battery of specialised mechanoreceptive sense organs inserted in the <b>cuticle</b> (<b>external</b> sense organs) (1).

40|$|Intracellular Ca 2 + {{homeostasis}} {{is critical}} to eukaryotic cells due to the important role that cytoplasmic free Ca 2 + plays as a second messenger in initiating routine cellular events including excitation–contraction coupling, hormonal release, alterations in cell metabolism and growth. In general, cells attempt to keep intracellular (IC) Ca 2 + low to preserve its function as a signaling agent and to avoid cell toxicity. Studies suggest that this involves coordination between transmembrane proteins on apical, basolateral and internal [sarco/endoplasmic reticular (SER) ] membranes that import and export Ca 2 +, such as channels, pumps, exchangers and binding proteins. Regulation of IC Ca 2 + is further challenged in polarized epithelial cells that vectorially transfer large amounts of Ca 2 + either in absorptive or secretory mode. The natural molting cycle of a freshwater crayfish, Procambarus clarkii, has emerged as an ideal non-mammalian model to study Ca 2 + homeostasis and the genes encoding the Ca 2 + handling proteins (Wheatly, 1999). As arthropods, crustaceans possess an <b>external</b> calcified <b>cuticle</b> that is periodically shed, enabling growth to occur. These episodes are preceded in premolt by reabsorption of Ca 2 + from the existing cuticle and deposition in storage sites (often regions of the digestive tract). Following ecdysis, there is intense pressure in postmolt to remineralize the new cuticle primarily with Ca 2 + absorbed from the external water. After calcification is completed, the animal returns to intermolt, a period during which net Ca 2 + flux is minimal. The beauty of this model system is that net Ca 2 + flux alternates from Ca 2 + balance (intermolt) to net loss (premolt) and then to significant net uptake (postmolt), offering an ideal model to examine the temporal and spatial regulation of genes coding for Ca 2 + handling proteins. Among crustaceans, the crayfish exhibits highly developed strategies for Ca 2 + homeostasis that have enabled it to evolve in freshwater, a highly inhospitable environment with respect to Ca 2 + availability (levels typically below 1 ·mmol·l– 1 compared with 10 ·mmol·l– 1 in seawater). Specifically, the antennal gland (kidney analog) produces a dilute urine, contributing significantly to the organism’...|$|R

40|$|When certain phytopathogenic fungi contact plant surfaces, {{specialized}} infection structures (appressoria) {{are produced}} that facilitate {{penetration of the}} plant <b>external</b> barrier; the <b>cuticle.</b> Recognition of this hydrophobic host surface must be sensed by the fungus, initiating the appropriate signaling pathway or pathways for pathogenic development. Using polymerase chain reaction and primers designed from mammalian protein kinase C sequences (PKC), we have isolated, cloned, and characterized a protein kinase from Colletotrichum trifolii, causal agent of alfalfa anthracnose. Though sequence analysis indicated conserved sequences in mammalian PKC genes, {{we were unable to}} induce activity of the fungal protein using known activators of PKC. Instead, we show that the C. trifolii gene, designated LIPK (lipidinduced protein kinase) is induced specifically by purified plant cutin or long-chain fatty acids which are monomeric constituents of cutin. PKC inhibitors prevented appressorium formation and, to a lesser extent, spore germination. Overexpression of LIPK resulted in multiple, abnormally shaped appressoria. Gene replacement of lipk yielded strains which were unable to develop appressoria and were unable to infect intact host plant tissue. However, these mutants were able to colonize host tissue following artificial wounding, resulting in typical anthracnose lesions. Taken together, these data indicate a central role in triggering infection structure formation for this protein kinase, which is induced specifically by components of the plant cuticle. Thus, the fungus is able to sense and use host surface chemistry to induce a protein kinase-mediated pathway that is required for pathogenic development...|$|R
40|$|We {{undertook}} {{a study of}} the mechanical transmission of parasitic organisms in cockroaches in the Samutprakarn province of Thailand. In this study, 920 cockroaches were obtained from 18 open-air shopping markets in 5 districts and 1 subdistrict of this province. All cockroaches were captured during their feeding time in their natural habitat. Direct wet smear and modified acid-fast bacilli staining were used to identify the parasites from the <b>external</b> surface or <b>cuticle</b> of the cockroaches. The results show that 498 (54. 1 %) of the cockroaches harbored parasitic organisms. Of these, 56. 1 % were protozoa and the remaining 43. 9 % were helminthes (pathogenic helminthes- 1. 4 %, non-pathogenic helminthes- 42. 5 %).

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{esophagus}} of Ascaris is a syncytial muscle {{organ of}} tubular shape {{in which the}} myofibrils are arranged radially between the lumen and the external surface. A resting potential of almost 40 my (cytoplasm negative) is maintained by the extracellular organic anions (volatile fatty acids) found in the perienteric fluid. Replacement of these anions by C 1 - ions results in a large depolarization. The resting potential is also decreased when the external pH is lowered. The leading phase of the action potential with a positive overshoot of about 18 mv elicits contraction of the myofibrils, development of negative pressure within the lumen, and suction of liquid and food particles. The mechanical energy stored in the elastic components of the cell is released when the myofibrils relax, thus injecting {{the contents of the}} lumen into the intestine. A fast and synchronous relaxation is elicited by a regenerative membrane polarization, a negative spike with a peak value of up to 108 mv produced by an increase in the permeability of the membrane to K+ ions. Cells completely depolarized in "chloride " saline are still able to generate such large potassium spikes. As in other nematodes, the initial and only motile segment of the digestive system of Ascaris is a stout hollow organ called the esophagus or pharynx. Its vigorous contractions transfer liquid and suspended food particles from the surrounding medium, the intestinal contents of the host, to its own intestine, a long and flattened tube consisting of a single layer of cylindrical cells. Although the esophagus is made up of 30 odd cells of 3 different types, the light microscope (even when working with 1 pm thick, plastic embedded sections, see Fig. 1) fails to reveal any obvious cellular boundaries between the <b>external</b> and internal <b>cuticles.</b> Furthermore, no appreciable barriers to the spread of electric current within the esophageal cytoplasm can be detected. For these reasons, we find it convenient to refer to the Ascaris esophagus as a single giant cell...|$|R
40|$|For {{many years}} the species {{problem in the}} Sacculinidae has {{been a matter of}} controversies. Kossmann's (1872) paper was of {{fundamental}} importance, because in his descriptions of a great number of new species, chiefly from the Philippine Islands, he derived the specific characters from the anatomical peculiarities {{as well as from the}} excrescences of the <b>external</b> <b>cuticle.</b> Later investigators for many years dealt with European material only, in which specific characters are far less apparent than in tropical Sacculinidae, so that their opinions concerning specific differences were often based on principles instead of on facts. This applies to the papers by Giard and Bonnier (Giard, 1886, 1887, 1888; Bonnier, 1887; Giard & Bonnier, 1887, 1890), in which the description of new species was regarded as sufficiently founded by a simple indication of the host, a procedure based on Giard's conviction of the "spécificité parasitaire", resulting from investigations on the Bopyridae. Previously, Delage (1884) had proclaimed the opinion that the specific differences in the genus Sacculina were not sufficiently founded, and many years later Smith (1906), after remarking that he had tried in vain to find specific differences in the European forms of the genus, placed all the names of the later described species in the synonymy of Sacculina carcini Thomps. Guérin-Ganivet (1911) described some new species of Sacculina based on characters of the internal anatomy; he did not investigate the excrescences of the <b>external</b> <b>cuticle,</b> which, e. g., in his species S. carpiliae and S. leptodiae, are of comparatively large size, consisting of groups of spines united on common basal parts.

Anadenanthera colubrina var. cebil is a timber tree from South America that produces large seeds with thin weak teguments, which is uncommon among legumes. This study describes the morphology and anatomy of the seed coat, the viability, imbibition, and germination in this species. Seeds used during the essays came from 10 trees that grow naturally in Horco Molle, province of Tucumán, Argentina. Seed morphology was described from a sample of 20 units. The seed coat surface was examined with a scanning electron microscope. Transverse sections of hydrated and non-hydrated seeds were employed to describe the histological structure of the seed coat. Hydration, viability and germination experiments were performed under laboratory controlled conditions; and the experimental design consisted of 10 replicas of 10 seeds each. Viability and germination tests were conducted using freshly fallen seeds and seeds stored for five months. Morphologically the seeds of A. colubrina var. cebil are circular to subcircular, laterally compressed, smooth, bright brown and have a horseshoe fissure line (=pleurogram) on both sides.

The taxonomy of the Rhizocephala is a rather difficult problem, which can be solved only after the study of a comparatively large material. The differences between the genera of this group of parasites are strikingly enough (cf.

The sorption was concentration-dependent and the DCMs always sorbed more surfactant than the CMs. PEG 100 -O could be completely desorbed from both CMs and DCMs. The impacts of surfactant on cuticular penetration of 2, 4 -D were studied by placing ¹⁴C- 2, 4 -D (0. 78 mM) in cylinders affixed to the <b>external</b> surface of <b>cuticles</b> after the cuticle segments had been treated with 10 ml I⁻¹ of various PEG surfactant. The same surfactant pretreatments were included in sorption studies in which cuticle segments were immersed in ¹⁴C- 2, 4 -D solution. Penetration of 2, 4 -D were inversely related to the HUB of the surfactant. Sorption of 2, 4 -D by CMs was unaffected by surfactant pretreatment. PEG 100 -O significantly increased cuticular penetration of dissociated 2, 4 -D at pH 4. 5. The enhanced penetration occurred only when surfactant was in the cuticles. Results of this study support the 'hydrophilic channel' hypothesis, viz. that surfactant may induce 'hydrophilic channels' formation in the cuticle, consequently enhancing the passing of polar molecules of pesticides through the cuticle...|$|R

The excrescences of the <b>external</b> <b>cuticle</b> of Sacculina reinhardi {{are similar to}} those of Sacculina gracilis. For a comparison of S. gracilis with S. reinhardi some additional data of previously described specimens of S. gracilis are here noted and figured, to show that certain characters of this species are constantly different from the corresponding peculiarities in the only available specimen of S. reinhardi.

40|$|The {{description}} of Sacculina leptodiae by Guérin-Ganivet (1911) {{was based on}} specimens infesting the crab Xantho exaratus (H. M. E.). Other specimens, identified as S. leptodiae or otherwise, have been mentioned in literature, so that the synonymy may be given as follows. Sacculina leptodiae Guérin-Ganivet, 1911 Sacculina leptodiae Guérin-Ganivet, 1911. Type specimens on Xantho exaratus (H. M. E.) from Jibuti, Gulf of Aden, and from Grande Comore.

The present paper {{is based on the}} examination of 7 specimens on Xantho exaratus (H. M. E.), 20 specimens on Thalamita stimpsoni A. M. E., and 13 specimens on Pseudozius caystrus (Ad. & White). It proved that there {{is a certain amount of}} variation in the shape and size of the male genital organs, in the structure of the colleteric glands, and in the size and shape of the excrescences of the <b>external</b> <b>cuticle.</b> Specimens occurring as parasites on one species of crab among each other show a corresponding degree of variation as that found when specimens from various hosts are compared. It seems therefore safe to conclude that the parasites of the three crabs, as far as they are characterized by corresponding excrescences of the <b>external</b> <b>cuticle,</b> really belong to one species.

40|$|The weights {{of single}} mealworms were {{continuously}} recorded at 20 °C during exposure to periods of constant humidity and to abrupt changes in atmospheric vapour pressure. Two exchange stages were recognized in each animal. Weight changes were either limited to slow losses, suggesting transpiration through the <b>external</b> <b>cuticle,</b> or showed more rapid humidity-dependent gains {{as well as}} losses. Rapid exchanges indicated that water was gained or lost through permeable barriers, from a fluid compartmet of significantly lower vapour pressure than the haemolymph, equivalent to about 90 % R. H. Weight gains and losses during humidity changes provided evidence of a significant, passively exchanging fluid compartment located between the exchange surface and absorbing mechanism. Weight changes in faecal pellets following their elimination provide further support for a rectal site of atmospheric absorption...|$|E
40|$|Free-living {{nematodes}} {{constitute an}} important component of estuarine and marine benthic ecosystems. Some marine and soil nematodes are known to harbor microbes, including symbiotic bacteria and fungi, in their <b>external</b> <b>cuticle</b> as well as internally. While assessing diversity of marine nematodes from southwest England using molecular approaches, we found evidence of co-amplification of fungal 18 S rRNA sequences in conjunction with nematode 18 S rRNA sequences. Based on an 18 S rRNA PCR-DGGE approach, 3 fungal clone types were detected alongside nematodes from 2 of 4 estuarine and marine sites in southwest England. At the phylogeny level, fungal clone type 1 belongs to Chaetothyriales while the other 2 clone types belong to Hypocreales. The fungal clones were co-amplified with specific marine nematode taxa indicating true ecological association rather than transient environmental contamination. The present study is the first to detect fungal 18 S sequences in parallel with marine nematodes and opens up a new avenue of research for investigating ecological interactions between nematodes and fungi in the marine environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} guard cells to hydrate and {{dehydrate}} {{from the surrounding}} air was investigated using isolated epidermes of Tradescantia pallida and Vicia faba. Stomata were found {{to respond to the}} water vapour pressure on the outside and inside of the epidermis, but the response was more sensitive to the inside vapour pressure, and occurred in {{the presence or absence of}} living, turgid epidermal cells. Experiments using helium–oxygen air showed that guard cells hydrated and dehydrated entirely from water vapour, suggesting that there was no significant transfer of water from the epidermal tissue to the guard cells. The stomatal aperture achieved at any given vapour pressure was shown to be consistent with water potential equilibrium between the guard cells and the air near the bottom of the stomatal pore, and water vapour exchange through the <b>external</b> <b>cuticle</b> appeared to be unimportant for the responses. Although stomatal responses to humidity in isolated epidermes are the result of water potential equilibrium between the guard cells and the air near the bottom of the stomatal pore, stomatal responses to humidity in leaves are unlikely to be the result of a similar equilibrium...|$|E
40|$|The {{authors who}} have studied the Rhizocephala have a quite {{different}} opinion as {{to the limits of}} the species, especially those of the genus Sacculina. On the one side KOSSMANN (1874) and GIARD (1887, 1888) are convinced that every specimen of Sacculina found on a certain crab has to be separated specifically from those living on another host. On the other hand SMITH (1906) unites all the described species of Sacculina into one widely distributed species which has to keep the name Sacculina carcini. A better way in separating the forms of Sacculina into different species is without doubt the one avoiding both the extremes of the above-cited authors, as explained by GUÉRINGANIVET (1911). Only in the cases where morphological structures of specific value are found the forms are to be regarded as different species. A more detailed account of the questions dealing with the difficulties of the species-problem in Sacculina will be published in the monograph on the Rhizocephala of the Siboga Expedition, now in preparation by Professor VAN KAMPEN and the present author. Here only may be pointed to some particularities found in the material dealt with in this paper. The material collected by Dr. VAN DER HORST at Curaçao contains four specimens of Rhizocephalid parasites. Three of these belong to the genus Sacculina, the fourth is a representative of the genus Lernaeodiscus. All of these differ from the hitherto known species of the two genera and are therefore described as new species in this paper. Though the material is comparatively small it is of great interest since the three species of Sacculina have a quite different structure. In this paper the structure of the <b>external</b> <b>cuticle</b> is used as a base in the diagnosis of the species. Many species of Sacculina, especially those from tropical regions, possess appendages on this chitinous cuticle, which have in a certain specimen a well-defined form. The size of the appendages may be different in the various regions of the mantle (e. g. those in the neighbourhood of the stalk may be of smaller size than those next to the mantle-opening), but within certain limits the form of these appendages is constant. Already KOSSMANN (1874) made use of the appendages of the <b>external</b> <b>cuticle</b> in the diagnosis of his species, but most authors have not employed this method. Some years ago VAN KAMPEN (1919), however, pointed out that the principles of KOSSMANN’s method could give good results in the taxonomy of this group...|$|E
40|$|Metamorphosis {{consists}} in a drastic reorganization of de-velopment {{in which an}} immature larva becomes a reproduc-tively active adult (Gilbert et al. 1996). The metamorphic process in insects occurs {{in the context of}} growth cycles characterized by molts, i. e., the periodic substitution of the old cuticle by a new one, newly-synthetized. After a series of larval molts, which number is variable among species, the larval-imaginal transition in holometabolous insects occurs through two molting cycles: one leading to pupation (meta-morphic molt) and the other ultimately resulting in differen-tiation of the adult (imaginal molt). The integument of insects consists of an <b>external</b> <b>cuticle,</b> or exoskeleton, that overlies the epidermis (Hepburn 1985). Each molting cycle begins with apolysis, the freeing (detach-ment) of the epidermal cells from the old exoskeleton (Jenkin & Hinton 1966) and finishes with ecdysis, the eventual shed-ding of non-profitable portion of cuticle. The morphogenetic period between apolysis and ecdysis is designated pharate (cloaked), which is the phase of an instar enclosed within the cuticle of the previous instar. Exoskeleton differentiation occurs essentially during the pharate period (Hinton 1946). The sequence of molting events, or molting dynamics, is coordinated by the titer of ecdysteroid hormones (Riddiford 1985; Nijhout 1994) and includes a complex process of cu-ticle hardening, or sclerotization, in which laccase enzymes have an essential role.

40|$|The {{surface of}} the hair is the region most exposed to solar {{radiation}} and to the environment in general. Many of the well-known damaging effects of sun exposure on hair must start or even be restricted to the most <b>external</b> <b>cuticle</b> layers. As such, this work investigates morphological, ultrastructural and chemical changes in the outermost cuticle layer of dark brown hair, using atomic force microscopy (AFM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). The results showed that after 230 h of irradiation with a mercury lamp, small bumps with globular shape (heights lying in the 1 - 5 nm range) appeared on the cuticle surface and their size increased with increasing irradiation times. In addition, the enlargement of pre-existing holes was also observed (holes increase around 350 % in depth) and {{the height of the}} steps formed between the edges of two cuticle scales increased around 65 %, as a result of 500 h of irradiation. The damages in hair strands were accurately identified by analyzing exactly the same surface region before and after irradiation by AFM images. Finally, the results were discussed in terms of the chemical differences between the non-irradiated and the irradiated hair, for instance, the increased level of cystine oxidation as a consequence of photodegradation.
