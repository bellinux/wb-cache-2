40|$|International audienceThe {{following}} work {{is devoted}} to the construction and validation of a numerical scheme for the 2 D shallow water system on unstructured meshes, supplemented by topography and friction source terms. Approximate solutions of <b>frictionless</b> <b>flows</b> are obtained considering a suitable formulation of the conservation laws, involving the water free surface and some fractions of water, accounting for the topography variations. The discretization of the friction source terms relies on the use of a modified Riemann solver for the flux computation. The resulting scheme is then corrected in order to achieve an asymptotic regime preservation. A MUSCL reconstruction is also performed to increase the space order of accuracy. The overall numerical approach is shown to be consistent, well-balanced and to satisfy a domain invariant principle. These results are assessed through several benchmark tests, involving complex geometry and varying bathymetry. In the presence of dry areas, special interest is given to the wave front speed computation, highlighting the stability of the method, even when implementing the asymptotic preserving correction...|$|R

Preservation of endothelial cell structure is vital for <b>frictionless</b> blood <b>flow,</b> prevention of macrophage and lipid infiltration and, ultimately, optimal vascular function. Exercise causes various kinds of mechanical, chemical and thermal stresses, and repeated exposure to these stresses may precondition the endothelial cell to future stresses through a number of different mechanisms.

Agents reinforce {{the establishment of a}} link if it was beneficial in the past, and suppress it otherwise. We illustrate the flexibility of the model to incorporate various design criteria, including dynamic cost functions that reflect link establishment and maintenance, and distance-dependent benefit functions. We show that the evolutionary process assigns positive probability to the emergence of multiple stable configurations (i. e., strict Nash networks), which need not emerge under alternative processes such as best-reply dynamics.

40|$|In {{the lecture}} series {{starting}} today author {{want to give}} a survey of a field of aerodynamics which has {{for a number of years}} been attracting an ever growing interest. The subject is the theory of flows with friction, and, within that field, particularly the theory of friction layers, or boundary layers. A great many considerations of aerodynamics are based on the ideal fluid, that is the frictionless incompressibility and fluid. By neglect of compressibility and friction the extensive mathematical theory of the ideal fluid, (potential theory) has been made possible. Actual liquids and gases satisfy the condition of incomressibility rather well if the velocities are not extremely high or, more accurately, if they are small in comparison with sonic velocity. For air, for instance, the change in volume due to compressibility amounts to about 1 percent for a velocity of 60 meters per second. The hypothesis of absence of friction is not satisfied by any actual fluid; however, it is true that most technically important fluids, for instance air and water, have a very small friction coefficient and therefore behave in many cases almost like the ideal frictionless fluid. Many flow phenomena, in particular most cases of lift, can be treated satisfactorily, - that is, the calculations are in good agreement with the test results, -under the assumption of frictionless fluid. However, the calculations with <b>frictionless</b> <b>flow</b> show a very serious deficiency; namely, the fact, known as d'Alembert's paradox, that in <b>frictionless</b> <b>flow</b> each body has zero drag whereas in actual flow each body experiences a drag of greater or smaller magnitude. For a long time the theory has been unable to bridge this gap between the theory of <b>frictionless</b> <b>flow</b> and the experimental findings about actual flow. The cause of this fundamental discrepancy is the viscosity which is neglected in the theory of ideal fluid; however, in spite of its extraordinary smallness it is decisive for the course of the flow phenomena...|$|E

Options for simplification are summarized based on time scale of hydrographs and length scales of river geometry. This results in concepts based on quasi-steady and/or quasi-uniform flow assumptions. Additionally, the behaviour of <b>frictionless,</b> critical <b>flow</b> with a mobile bed is considered. The non-linear interaction between changing flow and morphology is investigated for different {{values of the}} Froude number. Neglecting this interaction in numerical solution procedures appears to affect the solution. Also, mass and momentum contributions of sediment in transport on the mixture of water and sediment are analyzed. It is shown that errors due to simplification in numerical models for river morphology vary with the different up- or downstream propagating waves {{that are part of}} the solution. Conclusions further refer to the importance of wave non-uniformity (wave length, dominance of friction), Froude number and bed mobility on the error made when using simplified modelling concepts.

Experimental evidences have shown that graphene oxide can be impermeable to liquids, vapors and gases, while allowing a fast permeation of water molecules. This phenomenon {{has been attributed to}} the formation of a network of nano capillaries that allow nearly <b>frictionless</b> water <b>flow</b> while blocking other molecules by steric hindrance effects. It is supposed that water molecules are transported through the percolated two-dimensional channels formed between graphene-based sheets. Although these channels allow fast water permeation in such materials, the flow rates are strongly dependent on how the membranes are fabricated. Also, some fundamental issues regarding the nanoscale mechanisms of water permeation are still not fully understood and their interpretation remains controversial. In this work, we have investigated the dynamics of water permeation through pristine graphene and graphene oxide model membranes. We have carried out fully atomistic classical molecular dynamics simulations of systems composed of multiple layered graphene-based sheets into contact with a water reservoir under controlled thermodynamics conditions (e. g., by varying temperature and pressure values). We have systematically analyzed how the transport dynamics of the confined nanofluids depend on the interlayer distances {{and the role of the}} oxide functional groups. Our results show the water flux is much more effective for graphene than for graphene oxide membranes.

40|$|Negative {{charges in}} the glycocalyx of red blood cells (RBC) and {{vascular}} endothelial cells (EC) facilitate <b>frictionless</b> blood <b>flow</b> through blood vessels. Na+ selectively shields these charges controlling surface electronegativity. The question was addressed whether the ambient Na+ concentration controls RBC-EC interaction. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM) adhesion forces between RBC and endothelial glycocalyx were quantified. A single RBC, mounted on an AFM cantilever, was brought in physical contact with the endothelial surface and then pulled off. Adhesion forces were quantified (i) after enzymatic removal of negative {{charges in the}} glycocalyx, (ii) under different ambient Na+ and (iii) after applying the intracellular aldosterone receptor antagonist spironolactone. Removal of negative surface charges increases RBC-EC interaction forces. A stepwise increase of ambient Na+ from 133 to 140 mM does not affect them. However, beyond 140 mM Na+ adhesion forces increase sharply (10 % increase of adhesion force per 1 mM increase of Na+). Spironolactone prevents this response. It is concluded that negative charges reduce adhesion between RBC and EC. Ambient Na+ concentration determines the availability of free negative charges. Na+ concentrations in the low physiological range (below 140 mM) allow sufficient amounts of vacant negative charges so that adhesion of RBC to the endothelial surface is small. In contrast, Na+ in the high physiological range (beyond 140 mM) saturates the remaining negative surface charges thus increasing adhesion. Aldosterone receptor blockade by spironolactone prevents Na+ induced RBC adhesion to the endothelial glycocalyx.
