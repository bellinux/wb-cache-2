5|$|In the Northern Ireland Trophy (a ranking {{event in}} this season), he lost 4–5 to Lee in the quarter-finals, {{and in the}} UK Championship, he lost 3–9 to Alan McManus in the second round. A 3–6 defeat by Stephen Hendry in the quarter-finals of the Masters was {{followed}} by his second ranking title, when he defeated Ryan Day 9–4 in {{the final of the}} Malta Cup. After the victory, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> relief {{to get rid of the}} one-hit wonder label. In his next match, a victory over Jamie Cope in the Welsh Open, he scored centuries in four consecutive frames, becoming only the second player to do this (after Higgins in the 2005 Grand Prix final) and the only person to do so in a best-of-nine match. He went on to lose 3–5 to Maguire in the quarter-finals. In the World Championship, Murphy defeated Stevens 13–12 in the quarter-finals—recovering from 5–11 down and knocking the latter out of the top 16—before losing 16–17 against Mark Selby in the semi-finals.|$|E

A self-taught musician, he began {{to play the piano}} when he was between the ages of eleven and twelve years old, and he did not take any formal piano lessons. He has an older sister who also played the piano. After graduating from Kanagawa University with a degree in English, Uematsu played the {{keyboard}} in several amateur bands and composed music for television commercials. When Uematsu was working at a music rental shop in Tokyo, a Square employee asked if he would be interested in creating music for some of the titles they were working on. Although he agreed, Uematsu at the time considered it a side job, and he did not think it would become a full-time career. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> way to make some money on the side, while also keeping his part-time job at the music rental shop.|$|E

500|$|According to Pelé, indoor {{football}} presented difficult challenges; <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> lot {{quicker than}} football {{on the grass}} and that players were required to think faster because everyone is close {{to each other in the}} pitch. Pelé accredits indoor football for helping him think better on the spot. In addition, indoor football allowed him to play with adults when he was about 14-years-old. In one of the tournaments he participated, he was initially considered too young to play, but eventually went on to end up top scorer with fourteen or fifteen goals. [...] "That gave me a lot of confidence", Pelé said, [...] "I knew then not to be afraid of whatever might come".|$|E

It was seconds after this that he saw Tomlinson standing {{with his hands in}} his pockets beside a bicycle rack, being told by police to move away. Harwood told the inquest he made a [...] "split-second decision" [...] that there was justification for engagement, then struck Tomlinson on the thigh with his baton and pushed him to the ground. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> [...] "very poor push" [...] and he had been shocked when Tomlinson fell.

500|$|When Nobuo Uematsu {{was working}} at a music rental shop in Tokyo, a woman working in the art {{department}} for Square, which would later become Square Enix, approached him about creating music for some of their titles in development, and he agreed. Uematsu considered it a side job and was skeptical it would become any sort of full-time position. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> way {{to make some money}} on the side, while also keeping his part-time job at the music rental shop. Before joining Square, he composed music for television commercials. The first score he produced for Square was the soundtrack for the role-playing video game Cruise Chaser Blassty. While working at Square, he met Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, who asked him if he wanted to compose music for some of his games, which Uematsu agreed to. Sakaguchi gave him a few instructions for the soundtrack of Final Fantasy, Uematsu's 16th score, such as the need for [...] "battle" [...] and [...] "town" [...] music, but left the remainder of the composing to Uematsu, aside from informing him of the specific technical limitations of the Famicom system. The game was released in 1987.|$|E
500|$|Because the New York Dolls {{had little}} money, Sylvain and Thunders played the austerely {{designed}} and affordable Gibson Les Paul Junior guitars on the record. They jokingly {{referred to them}} as [...] "automatic guitars" [...] due to their limited sound shaping features. To amplify their guitars, they ran a Marshall Plexi standalone amplifier through the speaker cabinets of a Fender Dual Showman, and occasionally used a Fender Twin Reverb. Some songs were embellished with additional instruments, including Buddy Bowser's brassy saxophone on [...] "Lonely Planet Boy". Johansen sang into distorted guitar pickups for additional vocals and overdubbed them into the song. He also played an Asian gong for [...] "Vietnamese Baby" [...] and harmonica on [...] "Pills". For [...] "Personality Crisis", Sylvain originally played on The Record Plant's Yamaha grand piano before Rundgren added his own piano flourishes to both that song and [...] "Private World". Rundgren {{also contributed to the}} background vocals heard on [...] "Trash" [...] and played synthesizers on [...] "Vietnamese Baby" [...] and [...] "Frankenstein (Orig.)", which Sylvain recalled: [...] "I remember him getting those weird sounds from this beautiful old Moog synthesizer he brought in. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> model that only he and The Beatles had." ...|$|E

500|$|Executive {{producers}} Rick Berman and Brannon Braga {{had worked}} together to write a series of episodes for , with [...] "A Night in Sickbay" [...] amongst them. Berman originally described the episode as a press junket when talking about [...] at an event held by UPN for the Television Critics Association. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> [...] "very humorous episode that has our good captain going and spending some time in sickbay, because his dog gets sick. He moves into sickbay {{the same way a}} mother will move into the hospital when her child gets sick, and it ends up being an 'Odd Couple' kind of an episode between the captain and Dr. Phlox. It's a lot of fun." [...] Bakula also explained {{in an interview with the}} website TrekWeb that the episode featured Archer's dog Porthos as a background character and that it was also about Archer spending a night in sickbay with Phlox. He said that this meant that the viewer will [...] "find out a lot of stuff about [...] that we may not have wanted to know; like what he does when he's in his off hours... he has things to cut and trim!"

500|$|Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly stated, [...] "This song is a pulsy, {{possibly}} club-ready jam {{that deserves}} single status." [...] Heather Phares of Allmusic used [...] "Who Owns My Heart" [...] {{as an example}} of, according to her, a recurring problem on Can't Be Tamed: [...] "too often, Cyrus equates grown-up with joyless". Alexis Petridis of the United Kingdom magazine The Guardian felt the song was a gamely attempt at Lady Gaga. He said the chorus invites the answer: [...] "probably that creepy bloke from the Disney Channel who went on about violating your godliness." [...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters also found an alternate answer to the song's chorus. [...] "It’s commerce that owns your heart, Miley, and it always has been", he wrote. Mikael Wood of Billboard compared [...] "Who Owns My Heart" [...] to 2010 singles released by The Black Eyed Peas. Nick Levine of Digital Spy {{said it was a}} post-GaGa Hi-NRG track that was inclined to the generic. However, he said that lyrical references were a large reminder that Cyrus sung the track. Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic deemed [...] "Who Owns My Heart" [...] {{to be one of the}} best tracks from Can't Be Tamed, despite containing a [...] "cheesy ABBA-worthy chorus". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times also perceived the song to be [...] "in the vein of Cascada" [...] and one of the most [...] "exciting" [...] on Can't Be Tamed. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> sound that [...] "Ms. Cyrus hasn’t previously shown any affinity for and may never again. Still, it’s a timely and sharp sound." ...|$|E
500|$|A Love Surreal {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 82, based on 11 reviews. AllMusic's Andy Kellman said Bilal had improved {{as a producer}} and songwriter while remaining [...] "supernaturally skilled and creative" [...] as a vocalist, [...] "swooping, diving, wailing, and sighing, all with complete command." [...] Paste magazine's Evan Rytlewski said [...] "for {{the first time in}} his career, Bilal no longer sounds like an artist with entirely too much to prove; he's just a great singer, backed by great players he puts to good use on a set of sticky, deceptively inventive songs". Writing for NPR, Ann Powers said that A Love Surreal [...] "cultivates the stratospheric vibe" [...] of Coltrane's A Love Supreme while Bilal's ambition is [...] "grounded in fierce intelligence and a commitment to letting stories unfold all the way to their sometimes sorrowful, sometimes orgasmic end." [...] Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe called it [...] "bracingly good", [...] "compelling music" [...] that allows Bilal's [...] "falsetto to bring the intimate lyrics to life." [...] In The New York Times, Jon Pareles said his [...] "full-fledged" [...] voice [...] "needs no studio aid" [...] on songs that [...] "tease and insinuate" [...] with [...] "meanderings [...] lead somewhere." [...] Pitchfork journalist Jayson Greene was less impressed. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> [...] "joy" [...] to listen to Bilal [...] "warp his voice into improbable shapes", but believed the music lacked any prominent melodies. Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times was more critical of the closing series of slow jams and [...] "atmospheric clutter", while writing that the album's best songs [...] "warrant the increased attention" [...] in Bilal.|$|E

500|$|James Caldwell, {{also of the}} Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter, {{published}} {{a review of the}} show in which he also gave ratings out of 5 stars and some comments on the top matches on the card. He considered the main event [...] "underwhelming" [...] due to the [...] "audience having sat through every possible gimmick match combination prior to another Joe-Booker bout that everyone knew was going to end with some sort of gimmicky finish" [...] and that it was [...] "not memorable" [...] but that it would [...] "generate talk about Jarrett." [...] He gave the bout 2 stars. [...] "That was an epic match", said Caldwell when discussing the Last Man Standing match. However, he felt the bout had a [...] "silly pin-and-count-'em stipulation" [...] and that the [...] "all-too-real neck injury angle, followed by some post-match activity that took away from Styles's win." [...] Caldwell felt the match made Styles look [...] "like a star when he won, then he came across like a punk attacking Angle, then a fool being in position for Sting to take him out" [...] but that he had a [...] "memorable, star-making victory over Angle." [...] He disapproved of Styles being [...] "used a means to the end of explaining Sting's purpose-driven TNA life." [...] Caldwell rated the encounter 4 stars. As for the Street Fight, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> [...] "fun brawl for the audience" [...] and gave it 2 1/2 stars. Caldwell believed that the World Tag Team Championship match had [...] "good heat" [...] that [...] "over-rode the stream of outside interference, referee incompetence, and overall over-booking" [...] and that it was [...] "refreshing to see TNA use an injury angle from TV to set-up the finish of an important PPV match." [...] He gave the match 3 stars. The X Division Championship match was given 3 stars and he said it would have been [...] "great" [...] if it had avoided involving [...] "outside interference." ...|$|E

This and Duchamp's other works are generally labelled as Dada. Duchamp can be seen as a precursor to conceptual art. Some critics question calling Duchamp—whose obsession with paradox is well known—postmodernist on the grounds he eschews any specific medium, since paradox is not medium-specific, although it arose first in Manet's paintings.|$|E
