The BP section of the site <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> from the explosion and survived with very little damage, but it was inoperative as of 2009. BP is exploring {{plans for the future}} use of this part of the site, and has indicated a number of priorities, including the reopening of the fuel pipelines to Heathrow. It is considering using its section to store aviation fuel and as a distribution centre for motor fuel, but at a much-reduced level. In late 2009, Total UK submitted plans for the reconstruction of the oil depot. The reconstruction of the site has been taking place since March 2013.|$|E
500|$|Some of the {{contexts}} where the parity of zero makes an appearance are purely rhetorical. The issue provides material for Internet message boards and ask-the-expert websites. Linguist Joseph Grimes muses that asking [...] "Is zero an even number?" [...] to married couples <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> {{to get them}} to disagree. People who think that zero is neither even nor odd may use the parity of zero as proof that every rule has a counterexample, or {{as an example of a}} trick question.|$|E

They recruited session musicians to help record new parts and [...] "generally harness studio technology". Waters was not involved. Mason described the album as a tribute to Wright: [...] "I think this record <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> of recognising a lot of what he does and how his playing {{was at the heart of}} the Pink Floyd sound. Listening back to the sessions, it really brought home to me what a special player he was." ...|$|E

500|$|IGN's regular Fringe {{reviewer}} Ramsey Isler {{rated the}} episode 8/10. He compared the plot to Lost, remarking [...] "Apparently one thoroughly confusing and unnecessarily convoluted TV series wasn't enough... But hey, I understand why J.J. and his Fringe collaborators... {{might have done}} this. They had kind of written themselves into a corner {{where one of the}} universes had to go, and they couldn't stretch that storyline out forever. A restart like this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> to allow themselves room to write something new, even if it may require some clever thinking to explain themselves out of this situation adequately." [...] Isler had trouble rating the finale, noting that he had to see how the events are explained in the fourth season before he can make a complete judgment.|$|E
500|$|Giving {{the album}} 8 on 10, Alex Needham from NME criticized the compilation's lack of new tracks, and said [...] "while far from immaculate, {{this is still}} quite a collection". About GHV2, New Strait Times Christie Leo commented that [...] "this second volume of {{greatest}} hits isn't as immediately accessible as the first. But that's not what this collection is all about. This 14-track set actually provides a more daring glimpse into the inner machinations of the music marketing juggernaut, Madonna". AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave a mixed review calling it [...] "slightly disappointing", justifying {{that it was because}} during the 1990s, Madonna was an album artist. He finished his review saying that [...] "the end result is less {{than the sum of its}} parts, even if this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> to get all of Madge's 90s hits at once." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented that [...] "GHV2 certainly encapsulates the second decade of the performer's boundary-bridging career", but criticized the lack of new material, and its [...] "choppy edits, random sequences and missing links", saying: [...] "the collection doesn't seem to do justice to a career that has always been ahead of the game and focused on the future". Charlotte Robinson from PopMatters criticized its sequencing, stating, [...] "Chronological sequencing would have made it easier to follow the course of Madonna's musical evolution. But would these changes have made GHV2 a significantly better album? Probably not. As it stands, it's the best summary of Madonna's second decade as a performer we're going to get." ...|$|E

[...] However, a horse should always be groomed before being ridden to avoid chafing and rubbing of dirt and other material, which can cause sores on the animal and also grind dirt into horse tack. Grooming also allows the horse handler to check for injuries and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> to gain the trust of the animal.|$|E

2500|$|Following England's 1991 Rugby World Cup semi-final {{victory over}} Scotland in a tryless Test, Campese led a media {{campaign}} designating England as a boring rugby team. Campese {{said that if}} he played for England, he would insist on playing the flyhalf position because it would be {{the only way he could}} touch the ball. Campese is quoted as saying, 'I wouldn't play for England even if you paid me' and 'Playing that sort of boring stuff <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> to destroy the image of the game. They're all so scared of losing over here they won't try anything.' He further added that 'England would never beat us in the World Cup because they are a bunch of Toffs, and we are convicts.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Originally {{recorded}} with the working title of All at Once and then renamed Carry Her, Carry Me after {{a line in}} closing track [...] "The Blanket of Night", the band changed their mind shortly before the album's release and settled on naming the album after one of its tracks. Singer Guy Garvey explained, [...] "It's {{to do with the}} fact that there have been [...] life events. There are five members of the band—people have split up, got together, had children. It never stops, this stuff. Especially round the [...] 40 mark... and yet I wanted to remain celebratory about that. Everybody's feeling relief, with remorse, next to joy, next to loss.

2500|$|Although {{variable}} in color from blond to nearly black, grizzly bear fur is typically brown with darker legs and commonly white or blond tipped fur on the flank and back. A pronounced hump appears on their shoulders; the hump <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> to distinguish {{a grizzly bear}} from a black bear, as black bears do not have this hump. Aside from the distinguishing hump a grizzly bear can be identified by a [...] "dished in" [...] profile of their face with short, rounded ears, whereas a black bear has a straight face profile and longer ears. A grizzly bear can also be identified by its rump, which is lower than its shoulders, while a black bear's rump is higher. A grizzly bear's front claws measure about 2-4 inches in length and a black bear's measure about 1-2 inches in length.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the more}} {{positive}} side, Entertainment Weekly gave Lightning a B+ grade, saying that [...] "Songs with shotglass-half-full titles like [...] "It's Alright" [...] and [...] "Not That Bad" [...] build to fist-pump choruses, but there's just enough attitude to counter that rah-rah spirit." [...] Paste Magazine said the album, [...] "after a few listens, is actually pretty {{good if you}} forgive the total banality of its content. Which, by the way, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> to describe the album as a whole." [...] Both Consequence of Sound and Popmatters had opinions that the group's sound of their future albums could improve from Lightning. Allmusic said that the record was [...] "no kind of departure, but the slight variations in sound and the slightly expanded emotional palette mean that it's an improvement over the last record [...] or two [...]" [...] Magnet Magazine said the album had the [...] "tried-and-true formula that has worked so well for them." [...] Punknews found to album to be [...] "pop pleasure, with nothing to feel guilty about." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vegetarian diets {{typically}} contain similar {{levels of}} iron to non-vegetarian diets, {{but this has}} lower bioavailability than iron from meat sources, and its absorption can sometimes be inhibited by other dietary constituents. According to the Vegetarian Resource Group, consuming food that contains vitamin C, such as citrus fruit or juices, tomatoes, or broccoli, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> {{to increase the amount}} of iron absorbed at a meal. Vegetarian foods rich in iron include black beans, cashews, hempseed, kidney beans, broccoli, lentils, oatmeal, raisins, [...] spinach, cabbage, lettuce, black-eyed peas, soybeans, many breakfast cereals, sunflower seeds, chickpeas, tomato juice, tempeh, molasses, thyme, and whole-wheat bread. The related vegan diets can often be higher in iron than vegetarian diets, because dairy products are low in iron. Iron stores often tend to be lower in vegetarians than non-vegetarians, and a few small studies report very high rates of iron deficiency (up to 40%, and 58% of the respective vegetarian or vegan groups). However, the American Dietetic Association states that iron deficiency is no more common in vegetarians than non-vegetarians (adult males are rarely iron deficient); iron deficiency anaemia is rare no matter the diet.|$|E
2500|$|Australians have celebrated IMD on 19 November since 2003, when Phil Gouldson of Men's Health and Wellbeing Association ACT (MHWA) {{launched}} the inaugural event after receiving an invitation by Trinidad and Tobago's Harrack Balramsingh {{to join in}} the event. In Canberra, 2004, Gouldson asked men in Australia to wear a red rose for IMD and for women and families to buy the men in their life flowers. He said a red rose is worn by men on IMD as a symbol of strength of character and courage, and as it is unusual to see men being given flowers so it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> to highlight the occasion. In 2004, Michael Flood, an academic, criticized the basis of the 'Men's Health and Wellbeing Association' (MHWA)'s IMD celebration which focused on men's health, arguing that there were already enough opportunities to work on men's health and fatherhood (citing Father's Day and Men's Health Week). Gouldson responded, reminding that [...] "Not all men and boys are fathers, while Men's Health Week focuses on claimed inadequacies of men in not better managing their health." [...] Teelucksingh independently highlighted the need {{to address the needs of}} young boys, teenagers and men who are not fathers, which was one of his primary purposes for establishing International Men's Day.|$|E
