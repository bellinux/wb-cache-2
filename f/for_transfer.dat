Several other League One clubs were interested in him. Cheltenham Town had a bid accepted but Hooper eventually decided to move to Scunthorpe United. He scored just four goals in 44 appearances during his time at Southend. Although he did have two successful loan spells.|$|E

5|$|Between 1994 and 1998, {{there was}} local {{political}} debate about how Rikshospitalet, that {{was moving to}} Gaustad, should be served by public transport. The state wanted to extend the Ullevål Hageby Line of the tramway to the new hospital, while many local politicians {{wanted to use the}} rapid transit. Since the Ring Line would increase traffic on the Songsvann Line, moving the line was considered to better serve the hospital. In 1998, an agreement was reached whereby the light rail line would be built, and a new station <b>for</b> <b>transfer</b> from the metro would open at Forskningsparken.|$|E
5|$|Hancock {{was born}} on 31May 1907 in Perth, Western Australia, and educated at Hale School in Wembley Downs. He was the elder cousin of future mining magnate Lang Hancock. Val Hancock entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in 1925 and {{graduated}} as senior cadet in 1928, earning the Sword of Honour. His preferred career path in the military was engineering, {{and it was only}} when he found that there was no vacancy in his corps of choice, and that he had instead been earmarked for the artillery, that he put his name forward <b>for</b> <b>transfer</b> to the Royal Australian Air Force. He enlisted in the RAAF on 1February 1929, and undertook flying instruction at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, later that year.|$|E
5|$|He rejoined former club Durham City, newly {{promoted}} {{into the}} Northern Premier League Premier Division, in June 2009 along with Brayson.

He was later appointed captain. He suffered a cruciate ligament injury before signing for Newcastle Benfield of the Northern League Division One in 2013.

It was to be Myrie-Williams' only appearance for the club {{at the start of the}} campaign, and four days later, on 18 August, Dundee United manager Peter Houston told the player he was available <b>for</b> <b>transfer</b> in order to cut the club's wage bill. Shortly before the summer transfer window closed, on 31 August 2010, Myrie-Williams left the club by mutual consent.|$|E
5|$|He {{was linked}} with {{a move to}} League One club Crewe Alexandra in February 2008, having been unable to figure in Mixu Paatelainen's plans at Hibs, meaning he was frozen {{out of the first}} team.

In the summer of 2008, he was told that he was available <b>for</b> <b>transfer</b> by Hibs. Crewe were believed to be lining up a bid for him in July 2008, who had money available after selling striker Nicky Maynard to Bristol City for £2.25million and held negotiations with Donaldson. The move stalled after a six-figure fee had been agreed but Donaldson later agreed personal terms.|$|E

Afterwards, she was relegated to second-line roles before being sent to Taranto as a depot ship in 1918. She was struck from the navy list in 1920 and scrapped the following year.|$|E

5|$|However he {{struggled}} with poor form during the 1950–51 season as his first marriage {{was coming to an}} end and he came into increasing conflict with his teammates. He was angered when the club sold Jackie Sewell to Sheffield Wednesday in March 1951 – breaking Lawton's own transfer record in the process – as he felt the move showed a lack of ambition from the club's directors. He also found that the well paid job he was promised outside of football did not transpire. His tally of nine goals in 31 games in 1950–51 and 13 goals in 31 games in 1951–52 was disappointing, and he was made available <b>for</b> <b>transfer.</b>|$|E
5|$|In August 2002, {{after two}} final games for Canvey, {{he moved to}} Grays Athletic in a swap deal which saw Jeff Minton go in the {{opposite}} direction.

He joined Gravesend & Northfleet in September 2003, but played just four games for the club before moving on to Aldershot Town a month later. His form at Aldershot won him The Non-League Paper's Young Player of the Year award for the 2003–04 season, and also led to a call-up to the England National Game XI in February 2004, although it was to be his only cap for the semi-professional national team.|$|E

The transfer was canceled without explanation on 1 June 1943, but the alterations remained in place until 1944. She remained inactive during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in 1945.|$|E

5|$|The major Russian ORT TV station {{organised}} {{a national}} televised debate {{as to what}} should be done with the station.

Anatoly Artsebarsky argued that Mir should be kept because he believed that once it had been deorbited, the US would try to marginalise Russian involvement in the ISS. An online opinion poll showed 67% support worldwide for keeping it in orbit.|$|E
5|$|The seductive details {{effect has}} {{primarily}} been demonstrated {{at the point}} of knowledge acquisition (initial learning); its impact on transfer performance has not been clearly shown. Theory in text comprehension suggests that seductive details might be detrimental for recall but advantageous <b>for</b> <b>transfer</b> performance because of the schematic representation of information that trainees form during instruction. Researchers have described the seductive details effect as having a damaging effect on recall because it distracts trainees from learning and they tend to form inappropriate schemas to organize information. However, when learners are applying knowledge, empirical studies suggest that the distortion of the macro structure or schema of the instructional material is beneficial.|$|E
