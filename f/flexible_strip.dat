RFID tag antenna {{is widely used}} with different surfaces. The result found that RFID tag antenna can be bended or curved responding to the cylinder shape of the objects. Our proposed extended double-layer <b>flexible</b> <b>strip</b> dipole antenna has been technically designed to make changes on itself to obtain the result in increasing resonance frequency when it is being bended. The key concept {{of the study is}} the designed antenna which can freely change inside each layer when applying itself on curved object. The result of this design reveals that antenna has better performance than modern antenna. The extended double-layer <b>flexible</b> <b>strip</b> dipole antenna for RFID tags was designed for resonance frequency of 2. 45 GHz. Consequently, the analysis of antennaâ€™s efficiency will be affected by thickness. The designed antenna there will be considered and discussed to find out the relative value in order to use creating the design for the antenna that is suitable for the further study...|$|E
5000|$|Before computers, {{designs were}} {{drawn by hand}} on paper with various {{drafting}} tools. Rulers were used for straight lines, compasses for circles, and protractors for angles. But many shapes, such as the freeform curve of a ship's bow, could not be drawn with these tools. Although such curves could be drawn freehand at the drafting board, shipbuilders often needed a life-size version {{which could not be}} done by hand. Such large drawings were done with the help of <b>flexible</b> <b>strips</b> of wood, called splines. The splines were held in place at a number of predetermined points, called [...] "ducks"; between the ducks, the elasticity of the spline material caused the strip to take the shape that minimized the energy of bending, thus creating the smoothest possible shape that fit the constraints. The shape could be tweaked by moving the ducks.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} dynamic {{response}} of multiple <b>flexible</b> <b>strip</b> foundations {{resting on a}} multilayered poro-elastic half-plane subjected to time-harmonic vertical loading. The contact surface between the strip foundations and the half-plane {{is assumed to be}} smooth and either fully permeable or impermeable.

The vertical deflection of the strip foundation is represented by an admissible function containing a set of generalized coordinates. Solu-tions for generalized coordinates are obtained by establishing the equations of motion of the foundation through the application of Lagrangeâ€™s equations of motion.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses a}} class of boundary value problems arising in the modelling of scattering of fluid-structure coupled waves in ducts or channels with abrupt geometric changes and discontinuous material properties. The main aim is to invoke the semi-analytic methods such as mode-matching and Galerkin techniques to render the solutions to these archetypal boundary value problems. The envisaged scattering problems are governed by Laplace or Helmholtz equations together with high-order boundary conditions describing flexible duct or channel boundaries. It is substantiated that the separation of variables reduces these boundary value problems to non-StrumLiouville eigen-systems wherein the eigen-functions are neither orthogonal nor linearly independent. In this effect, generalized orthogonal relations are established which, together with a mode-matching technique, render a solution by matching modes across the interfaces of the geometric and material discontinuities. The emphasis in the dissertation is on membrane and elastic plate bounded ducts involving step discontinuities at interfaces with varying properties. Precisely, soft, rigid and flexible step discontinuities are taken into account. The viability of the modematching technique {{from the perspectives of}} the generalized orthogonal relations to address aforementioned acoustic scattering problems in ducts or channels with soft, rigid or <b>flexible</b> vertical <b>strips</b> is mathematically analysed and is supported with apposite numerical experiments. Due to the slow convergence rate of mode-matching solutions for scattering problems involving <b>flexible</b> <b>strips,</b> Galerkin method is employed as an attractive and potential alternative. The expressions for energy fluxes in different regimes are obtained and the analysis of power balance is performed...|$|R

40|$|A stress {{integration}} algorithm for granular materials {{based on}} fully implicit integration with explicit updating is presented. In the implicit method the solution {{makes use of}} the gradient to the potential surface at the final stress state which is unknown. The final stress and hardening parameters are determined solving the non-linear equations iteratively so that the stress increment fulfills the consistency condition. The integration algorithm is applicable for models depending on all the three stress invariants and it is applied to a characteristic state model for granular material. Since tensile stresses are not supported the functions and their derivatives are not representative outside the compressive octant of the principal stress space. The elastic predictor is therefore preconditioned {{in order to ensure}} that the first predictor is within the valid region. Capability and robustness of the integration algorithm are illustrated by simulating both drained and undrained triaxial tests on sand. The algorithm is developed in a standard format which can be implemented in several general purpose finite element codes. It has been implemented as an ABAQUS subroutine, and a traditional geotechnical problem of a <b>flexible</b> <b>strip</b> footing resting on a surface of sand is investigated in order to demonstrate the global accuracy and stability of the numerical solution.

40|$|A robust {{polymeric}} waveguide {{technology is}} proposed for affordable optoelectronic interconnects in massively parallel processing applications. We have developed high-performance organic polymeric materials {{that can be}} readily made into both multimode and single-mode optical waveguide structures of controlled numerical aperture and geometry. These materials are formed from highly-crosslinked acrylate monomers with specific linkages that determine properties such as flexibility, toughness, loss, and stability against yellowing. These monomers are intermiscible, providing for precise adjustment of the refractive index from 1. 30 to 1. 60. Waveguides are formed lithographically, with the liquid monomer mixture polymerizing upon illumination in the UV via either mask exposure or laser direct-writing. A wide range of rigid and flexible substrates can be used, including glass, quartz, oxidized silicon, glass-filled epoxy printed circuit board substrate, and flexible polyimide film. Our waveguides are low loss (0. 02 dB/cm at 840 nm) as well as temperature resistant (over 65 years at 100 Â°C) and humidity resistant (no effect on unpackaged guides after 600 hours at 85 Â°C 85 % RH), enabling use {{in a variety of}} demanding applications. We discuss the use of these materials on multi-chip modules (MCM's), boards, and backplanes.
