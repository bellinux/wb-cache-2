500|$|In 2009, Chevelle {{entered a}} studio in Nashville, Tennessee with {{producer}} Brian Virtue. Sam Loeffler stated, [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time making these songs something different from past records without losing {{the core of our}} passion. We are a hard rock, melodic band and it's still what drives us as musicians." [...] The new album, titled Sci-Fi Crimes was released on August 31, 2009, peaking at No.6 on the Billboard 200 album chart with sales of about 46,000, the highest entry onto the chart to date for the band., The album was praised by Jared Johnson of Allmusic for taking a step in a new direction in regards to the lyrics.

The tour following the release of Sci-Fi Crimes was in the Fall of 2009. Opening for Chevelle on this tour was Halestorm, Adelitas Way, and After Midnight Project.|$|E
500|$|SFScope {{columnist}} Sarah Stegall {{agreed with}} Murray's Lost comparison, writing that {{the ending of}} the episode was [...] "right out of the Lost playbook, a little too on the nose for my liking." [...] Stegall did however call it a [...] "good bridge episode, taking us from the setup of last week to the denouement next week, when it all comes together." [...] IGN writer Ramsey Isler was more positive about the final sequence, explaining that the [...] "last five minutes of this story changed everything, and made me excited about the series again." [...] While praising the special effects, he also noted his displeasure that Sam Weiss [...] "ends up not being as mystical or magical as previous stories hinted". Isler wished Corrigan had more screen time in the episode, calling it [...] "under-utilization of a great character the writers <b>have</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time building up." [...] He rated it 7.5/10, an indication of a [...] "good" [...] episode, but criticized its [...] "slow" [...] pacing.|$|E
500|$|Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez {{was adamant}} that opponents Chelsea were the team {{under the most}} {{pressure}} to win the match: [...] "There will be more pressure on them, they <b>have</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> money and are {{the best team in}} the league, because they are in first position, but they've lost their last two important games. That means they will be under pressure. People will see them as the favourites, I'm sure, so the pressure is on them and not us." [...] Benítez was confident that playing in a cup final would be beneficial to his players: [...] "We need experiences like this to progress, when I decided to come here I said I wanted to win trophies. Our challenge is to win the Premier League, the Champions League, the Uefa Cup, the FA Cup and the Carling Cup. This is a chance to start." [...] Goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek believed winning the competition in 2003 would benefit Liverpool: [...] "It was great to win there before and I also had one of my best performances for Liverpool. There's a great buzz around the place; we know that the club expects to win trophies, and we're in a position to deliver that later this week." ...|$|E

2500|$|James Fitzjames {{entered the}} Royal Navy {{at the age}} of 12 in July 1825 as a Volunteer of the Second Class on HMS Pyramus, a frigate under the command of Captain Robert Gambier. [...] He served on the Pyramus until 15 September 1828, being {{promoted}} to Volunteer of the First Class on 1 July 1828. [...] Captain Robert Gambier was actually James Fitzjames's second cousin, and it was through this covert family connection {{that he was able to}} obtain this position, notwithstanding his illegitimacy and the Coningham family's lack of Royal Naval connections. [...] Unfortunately Captain Gambier resigned his position only a year later due to the unexpected death of his wife, leaving Fitzjames vulnerable as he had no connection with the new Captain, George Sartorius. However, clearly James Fitzjames was able to win the confidence of Captain Sartorius as it was he who promoted Fitzjames to Volunteer of the First Class in 1828. During this commission the Pyramus first sailed to Central America and the United States on diplomatic missions and was then involved in scientific research as part of the Experimental Squadron under Admiral Sir Thomas Hardy. Later she served as British guardship at Lisbon. [...] While there {{at the age of}} 15, James Fitzjames seems to <b>have</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time ashore and given the close political links between Portugal and Brazil, it has been suggested that he may have had personal links to Portuguese society; possibly his mother was Portuguese.|$|E

For those who <b>have</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time sailing (as opposed to 'power boating'), down wind is more important to a sailor than decreasing longitude.|$|E
