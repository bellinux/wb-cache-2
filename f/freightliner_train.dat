50|$|The 17:54 {{passenger}} train from Euston to Bletchley, formed by two Class 310 electric multiple units, {{collided with a}} <b>Freightliner</b> <b>train</b> which was leaving Willesden yard. The first two coaches of the {{passenger train}} overturned onto their sides and three passengers were killed; 17 passengers and the driver were injured.|$|E
50|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 1 May 1984 a <b>freightliner</b> <b>train</b> was {{descending}} from Shap on the main line, and became divided. The front portion of the train continued, but the rear portion slowed but then also continued by gravity. Entering the Carlisle complex it was diverted on to the goods avoiding lines. These were sharply curved and the train portion became derailed, causing considerable damage in the process. The route was closed by the damage caused, and in December 1985 the decision was taken not to restore the route, and accordingly it was permanently closed. Signalling changes at Citadel station were made to facilitate all traffic passing through it.|$|E

50|$|Today Carlisle is an {{important}} point on the West Coast main line railway, and a junction for radiating secondary routes. Passenger traffic is buoyant, and long distance <b>freightliner</b> <b>trains</b> pass through.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of freight trains that are {{generally}} routed through platforms 3 and 4. In 2012 these include <b>freightliner</b> <b>trains</b> (Isle of Grain), gypsum (Hothfield), aggregates (Angerstein Wharf) and nuclear material (Dungeness).|$|R
50|$|GNER {{suffered}} {{two major}} accidents during its operating years. In the Hatfield crash on 17 October 2000, the 12:10 London King's Cross - Leeds train derailed {{just south of}} Hatfield station due to a hairline crack in the rail. Four passengers {{were killed in the}} restaurant car, which struck an overhead catenary stanchion during the derailment. GNER's other accident was the Great Heck rail crash on the morning of 28 February 2001, where a Newcastle-London service hit a Land Rover that had driven off the M62 motorway. The GNER train derailed and was subsequently hit by a <b>Freightliner</b> <b>train</b> from Immingham to Ferrybridge, resulting in the death of ten people.|$|E
5000|$|In 1967 in the UK {{there were}} four {{derailments}} due to buckling of continuously welded track ("cwr"): at Lichfield on 10 June, an empty carflat train (a train of flat cars for transporting automobiles); on 13 June an express passenger train was derailed at Somerton; on 15 July a <b>freightliner</b> <b>train</b> (container train) was derailed at Lamington; and on 23 July an express passenger train was derailed at Sandy. The official report was not entirely conclusive as to the causes, but it observed that the annual total of buckling distortions was 48 in 1969, having been in single figures in every previous year, and that heat-related distortions per 1,000 miles per annum were 10.42 for cwr and 2.98 for jointed track in 1969, having been a maximum of 1.78 and 1.21 in the previous ten years. 90% of the distortions {{could be attributed to}} one of the following: ...|$|E
50|$|In 2014 at {{the very}} {{southern}} end of the line a new chord was opened linking the East Suffolk line to the line to Bury St Edmunds and the Midlands. This line is primarily used by <b>Freightliner</b> <b>trains</b> to or from Felixstowe Docks with a new junction called Boss Hall Junction enabling access to the chord.|$|R
50|$|On 13 July 1964 {{the goods}} yard closed with the {{track in the}} bay {{platforms}} being lifted sometime later in the 1960s. In 1967 all booking offices in the area closed and all trains became operated by conductor guards. The late 1960s saw the steady growth of freight through Felixstowe with <b>Freightliner</b> <b>trains</b> being seen increasingly through Westerfield.|$|R
25|$|With {{franchising}} of {{passenger train}} services from 1996 under then controversial privatisation of British Rail, Virgin Trains {{has become the}} main operator on the London and Birmingham to Glasgow route, introducing Pendolino train sets. Locomotive haulage of passenger trains has virtually disappeared on the route (although locomotive hauled <b>freightliner</b> <b>trains</b> are increasing). The main line service frequency is considerably better than ever before. First TransPennine Express operate a frequent service between Manchester Airport and Glasgow and Edinburgh.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{electrification}} from London Liverpool Street to , Harwich, [...] and [...] saw the class employed on passenger trains to these towns. In addition, {{many of the}} <b>freightliner</b> <b>trains</b> to [...] were also hauled as far as Ipswich by Class 86 locomotives working in multiple. By {{the end of the}} 1980s, the need for a standard fleet saw all remaining Class 86/0 and Class 86/3 locomotives fitted with improved suspension and converted to Class 86/4. These locomotives were now inter-operable with Class 86/2, and thus gave greater operational flexibility.|$|R
50|$|This {{is located}} between Ipswich and East Suffolk Junction {{on the east}} side of the line. The yard is still active (as of 2013) with <b>Freightliner</b> (container) <b>trains</b> {{recessing}} or running round before running to/from the docks at Felixstowe.|$|R
50|$|Public freight {{facilities}} {{had been}} withdrawn from Westerfield and Trimley on 13 July 1964, and from both stations at Felixstowe on 5 December 1966. The following year saw {{the completion of}} a new container terminal at the docks which was served by <b>Freightliner</b> <b>trains.</b> This helped to contribute to the docks handling 2,019,270 tons in 1969 which was more than nine times the traffic of ten years earlier. On 13 May 1970 a new direct line to Felixstowe Docks was opened. This used the same alignment as in 1877 to 1898 and removed the need of trains to reverse at Felixstowe Town. At the same time the station was reduced to just a single platform and the 1898 line from there towards the docks was closed.|$|R
50|$|The Melksham {{single line}} {{serves as a}} diversionary route when either the Paddington-Westbury-Taunton or Taunton-Bristol Temple Meads-Bath routes are closed for {{engineering}} work or otherwise disrupted; occasional use is also made of the line by <b>Freightliner</b> <b>trains</b> running between Southampton and the Midlands when their normal route via Basingstoke and Reading is unavailable. GWR's hourly Portsmouth Harbour-Cardiff Central services are sometimes diverted via Melksham to terminate and start at Swindon rather than Cardiff when engineering work is taking place between Bath, Bristol and the Severn Tunnel {{in connection with the}} electrification of the Great Western main line. The downside of these diversions is that the local Westbury-Swindon 'Trans Wilts' service often has to be covered by a Rail Replacement bus service as there are insufficient paths available over the 8 mile single line section {{due to a lack of}} intermediate signal sections.|$|R
50|$|The line {{is heavily}} used for freight {{services}} also, with several <b>Freightliner</b> container <b>trains</b> {{a day from}} the nearby Coatbridge terminal to destinations {{in the south of}} England such as Felixstowe and Southampton. It is also used by services to the Mossend freight terminal as well as those travelling from the West Coast Main Line to the Highlands.|$|R
5000|$|Railtrack {{initiated}} an upgrading of the Felixstowe {{branch line}} in 1997, {{the first time}} that it had done this speculatively in anticipation of it receiving increased revenue from freight train operators. The passing loop at Derby Road was extended so that two container trains could pass, the signalling replaced and transferred to the control of [...] Power Signalling Box, and the line speed was increased. The aim was to allow an hourly passenger train service to operate while accommodating more freight trains. The line as far as Felixstowe Beach was maintained to passenger standard in case a service to there is resumed in the future. Electrification was again considered as most <b>Freightliner</b> <b>trains</b> were by then being worked by electric locomotives to Ipswich where they had to be changed to diesel for the short trip to Felixstowe, but the cost of this could not be justified. The work cost Â£8,000,000 and was completed by June 1999.|$|R
50|$|In {{recent years}} they have used West Coast Railway Company, based in Carnforth to provide both {{locomotives}} and rolling stock, but have also used DB Schenker (previously EWS), Cotswold Rail, FM Rail (previously Fragonset and Merlin Rail), Direct Rail Services, <b>Freightliner,</b> Riviera <b>Trains,</b> Class 40 Preservation Group and AC Loco Group in the past. The Compass Tours archive shows a full list of previously used locomotives.|$|R
50|$|Aurizon and Pacific National both provide {{locomotives}} and {{freight wagons}} to operate coal <b>trains.</b> <b>Freightliner</b> Australia provide crews to operate Xstrata owned rolling stock, with Pacific National doing likewise for Whitehaven Coal and Southern Shorthaul Railroad for Centennial Coal.|$|R
50|$|After {{closure of}} the 1950s {{developed}} hump shunting yard, freight since the 2008 credit crunch have declined significantly, and the associated Bescot TMD now carries no allocation of locomotives. DB Schenker services workings are still the mainstay of operations in the area, Direct Rail Services nuclear flask trains pass {{once or twice a}} week, and Freightliner Group Intermodal and Automotive trains also pass through. Regular <b>Freightliner</b> Coal <b>trains</b> also run around on the up goods on their way to Rugeley Power Station.|$|R
50|$|The InterCity 225 was {{propelled}} by a Class 91 locomotive (No.91023) {{and led by}} a Driving Van Trailer (DVT). After striking the Land Rover, the leading bogie of the DVT derailed but the train stayed upright. Points to nearby sidings then deflected it {{into the path of}} an oncoming <b>Freightliner</b> freight <b>train</b> carrying coal. The freight train was travelling from Immingham to Ferrybridge. The freight train hit the wreckage resulting in severe to moderate damage to all nine of the InterCity 225's coaches.|$|R
50|$|The Freightliner fleet saw use {{over a wide}} area, serving {{locations}} such as Ipswich, Southampton, Birmingham, Cardiff and Leeds. The {{introduction of}} the class resulted in {{the replacement of the}} Class 47 locomotives on most long-distance intermodal <b>trains.</b> <b>Freightliner</b> named all its locomotives, with examples such as Freightliner Pioneer and Freightliner Phoenix.|$|R
5000|$|Passenger {{services}} are now operated by Chiltern Railways. The line is regularly used by freight services operated by DB Cargo UK and <b>Freightliner.</b> The <b>trains,</b> {{referred to as}} [...] "binliners", carry waste from London to a waste facility {{near the site of}} the former Great Central Railway station at Calvert. For this purpose, during Chiltern Railways' Evergreen 2 project the line was resignalled with two new signals at Little Kimble, one for each direction of travel. These allow two trains to travel in the same direction, thus allowing a passenger service to follow the freight train or vice versa.|$|R
50|$|<b>Freightliner's</b> first single-shipper <b>train</b> was {{operated}} on 20 August 1968, hauling specially-designed 30-foot containers carrying parts for Ford Escort cars that were destined for assembly in plants on the European mainland. Although initially intended for domestic freight, this was soon overtaken by freight between deep-sea ports, such as Southampton Maritime and inland distribution terminals associated with centres of manufacturing or population, such as Birmingham Lawley Street.|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} rail freight {{services}} run throughout the region. The Port of Felixstowe {{is a major}} focus for these with around 830,000 containers travelling by rail in 2013. This equates to {{over a quarter of}} all container traffic leaving the port as of early 2013. in June 2013 a new nine track container terminal opened, expanding the number of lines available to 20. The new terminal is the third at the port and the first in the country to be capable of handling 30-wagon <b>trains.</b> <b>Freightliner</b> have a depot at Ipswich station. The Ipswich Railway Chord opened in March 2014. This links the East Suffolk Line with the Great Eastern Main Line at Ipswich, allowing easier access to the national rail network for rail freight from Felixstowe.|$|R
5000|$|The InterCity 225 was {{propelled}} by a Class 91 locomotive (No.91023) {{and led by}} Driving Van Trailer (DVT) No. 82221. After striking the Land Rover, the leading bogie of the DVT derailed but the train stayed upright. Points to nearby sidings then deflected it {{into the path of}} an oncoming <b>Freightliner</b> freight <b>train</b> carrying coal [...] and travelling from Immingham to Ferrybridge hauled by a Class 66 locomotive (No.66521). [...] The freight train hit the wreckage approximately 642 m from the passenger train's impact with the Land Rover. The impact resulted in the near destruction of the lightweight DVT and severe to moderate damage to all nine of the InterCity 225's coaches, which mostly overturned and came to rest down an embankment to {{the east side of the}} track, in a field adjacent to the railway line just south of overbridge ECM 2/7. The trailing locomotive remained upright and suffered minor damage, although it was derailed. The Class 66 lost its bogies after impact, with debris of the DVT jammed underneath rupturing its fuel tank. The freight locomotive then overturned onto its left side coming to rest in the garden of a residence adjacent to the line to the north of the same bridge. The locomotive sustained major damage to its cab area and right side. The first nine wagons following it were also derailed and damaged to varying extents.|$|R
50|$|In {{preparation}} for full privatisation, BR was split up into various parts. Provision of passenger services was split up into twenty-five passenger train operating units (TOUs), known as Shadow franchises, split by geographical area and service type. For freight services, six freight operating companies (FOCs) were created - three geographical units for trainload freight (Mainline Freight in the south-east, Load-Haul in the north-east and Trans-Rail in the west), plus Railfreight Distribution for international and wagonload <b>trains,</b> <b>Freightliner</b> (UK) for container-carrying trains, and Rail Express Systems for parcels and mail trains. British Rail Infrastructure Services (BRIS) took {{responsibility for the}} engineering requirements of the railway. BRIS was subsequently organised for privatisation {{on the basis of}} seven infrastructure maintenance units (IMUs), which maintained the railway, and six track renewal units (TRUs), which replaced rail lines, both organised geographically.|$|R
