5|$|Dynamical {{friction}} from {{a massive}} belt of planetesimals could also enable Planet Nine's capture {{in a stable}} orbit. Recent models propose that a 60–130 Earth mass disk of planetesimals could have <b>formed</b> <b>via</b> streaming instabilities following the photoevaporation of the outer parts of the gas disk. If the disk had a distant inner edge, 100–200 AU, a planet encountering Neptune would have a 20% chance of being captured in an orbit similar to that proposed for Planet Nine. The observed clustering is more likely if the inner edge is at 200 AU. Unlike the gas nebula the planetesimal disk {{is likely to be}} long lived, potentially allowing a later capture.|$|E

This {{is the first time}} propene has been found on any moon or planet other than Earth and is the first chemical found by the CIRS. The detection of propene fills a mysterious gap in observations that date back to NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft's first close flyby of Titan in 1980, during which it was discovered that many of the gases that make up Titan's brown haze were hydrocarbons, theoretically <b>formed</b> <b>via</b> the recombination of radicals created by the Sun's ultraviolet photolysis of methane.|$|E

5|$|Cirrocumulus clouds form in {{patches and}} cannot cast shadows. They {{commonly}} appear in regular, rippling patterns or in rows of clouds with clear areas between. Cirrocumulus are, like {{other members of}} the cumuliform and stratocumuliform categories, <b>formed</b> <b>via</b> convective processes. Significant growth of these patches indicates high-altitude instability and can signal the approach of poorer weather. The ice crystals in the bottoms of cirrocumulus clouds tend to be in the form of hexagonal cylinders. They are not solid, but instead tend to have stepped funnels coming in from the ends. Towards the top of the cloud, these crystals have a tendency to clump together. These clouds do not last long, and they tend to change into cirrus because as the water vapor continues to deposit on the ice crystals, they eventually begin to fall, destroying the upward convection. The cloud then dissipates into cirrus. Cirrocumulus clouds come in four species which are common to all three genus-types that have limited-convective or stratocumuliform characteristics: stratiformis, lenticularis, castellanus, and floccus. They are iridescent when the constituent supercooled water droplets are all about the same size.|$|E

25|$|Supermicelle is a {{hierarchical}} micelle structure (supramolecular assembly) where individual components are also micelles.

25|$|Cellular RNA cap {{structures}} are <b>formed</b> <b>via</b> {{the action of}} an RNA triphosphatase, with guanylyltransferase, N7-methyltransferase and 2′-O methyltransferase. The virus encodes these activities in its non-structural proteins. The NS3 protein encodes a RNA triphosphatase within its helicase domain. It uses the helicase ATP hydrolysis site to remove the γ-phosphate from the 5′ end of the RNA. The N-terminal domain of the non-structural protein 5 (NS5) has both the N7-methyltransferase and guanylyltransferase activities necessary for forming mature RNA cap structures. RNA binding affinity is reduced {{by the presence of}} ATP or GTP and enhanced by S-adenosyl methionine. This protein also encodes a 2′-O methyltransferase.|$|E

25|$|The {{two most}} viable {{explanations}} put forth {{for the existence}} of blue stragglers both involve interactions between cluster members. One explanation is that they are current or former binary stars that {{are in the process of}} merging or have already done so. The merger of two stars would create a single more massive star, potentially with a mass larger than that of stars at the main-sequence turn-off point. While a star born with a mass larger than that of stars at the turn-off point would have already evolved off of the main sequence, a more massive star which <b>formed</b> <b>via</b> merger would not have evolved as quickly. There is evidence in favor of this view, notably that blue stragglers appear to be much more common in dense regions of clusters, especially in the cores of globular clusters. Since there are more stars per unit volume, collisions and close encounters are far more likely in clusters than among field stars and calculations of the expected number of collisions are consistent with the observed number of blue stragglers.|$|E
25|$|Reticuline {{is known}} as the {{immediate}} precursor of protoberberine alkaloids in plants. Berberine is an alkaloid derived from tyrosine. L-DOPA and 4-hydroxypyruvic acid both come from L-tyrosine. Although two tyrosine molecules are used in the biosynthetic pathway, only the phenylethylamine fragment of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring system is <b>formed</b> <b>via</b> DOPA, the remaining carbon atoms come from tyrosine via 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. L-DOPA loses carbon dioxide to form dopamine 1. Likewise, 4-hydroxypyruvic acid also loses carbon dioxide to form 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde 2. Dopamine 1 then reacts with 4-hydroxy-phenylacetaldehyde 2 to form (S)-norcolaurine 3 in a reaction similar to the Mannich reaction. After oxidation and methylation by SAM, (S)-reticuline 4 is formed. (S)-reticuline serves as a pivotal intermediate to other alkaloids. Oxidation of the tertiary amine then occurs and an iminium ion is formed 5. In a Mannich-like reaction the ortho position to the phenol is nucleophilic, and electrons are pushed to form 6. Product 6 then undergoes keto-enol tautomerism to form (S)-scoulerine, which is then methylated by SAM to form (S)-tetrahydrocolumbamine 7. Product 7 is then oxidized to form the methylenedioxy ring from the ortho-methoxyphenol, via an O2-, NADPH- and cytochrome P-450-dependent enzyme, giving (S)-canadine 8. (S)-canadine is then oxidized to give the quaternary isoquinolinium system of berberine. This happens in two separate oxidation steps, both requiring molecular oxygen, with H2O2 and H2O produced in the successive processes.|$|E

Other substitution derivatives include acetic anhydride; this anhydride is produced by loss of water from two molecules of acetic acid.
