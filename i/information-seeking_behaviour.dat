50|$|In April 2012, Tobias Preis, Helen Susannah Moat, H. Eugene Stanley and Steven R. Bishop used Google Trends data to {{demonstrate}} that Internet users from countries with a higher per capita gross domestic product (GDP) {{are more likely to}} search for information about the future than information about the past. The findings, published in the journal Scientific Reports, suggest there may be a link between online behaviour and real-world economic indicators. The authors of the study examined Google search queries made by Internet users in 45 different countries in 2010 and calculated the ratio of the volume of searches for the coming year (‘2011’) to the volume of searches for the previous year (‘2009’), which they call the ‘future orientation index’. They compared the future orientation index to the per capita GDP of each country and found a strong tendency for countries in which Google users enquire more about the future to exhibit a higher GDP. The results hint that there may potentially be a relationship between the economic success of a country and the <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> of its citizens online.|$|E
40|$|Introduction. We {{report an}} {{investigation}} designed to explore <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> of extension managers and specialists in Iran, {{and to identify}} the factors that correlate with their <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Method. A questionnaire was developed to explore <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> of extension managers and specialists. Analysis. Data collected were analyzed using the statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS). Appropriate statistical procedures for description (frequencies, percent, means, and standard deviations) were used. Results. Results showed that the main motivation for seeking job-related information by both public extension managers and specialists was because {{they were interested in}} developing their own job-related information. The top three mostly used information sources by extension managers and specialists were Persian books, Persian scientific magazines, and scientific-technical reports. Concerning communication channels, interpersonal communication with colleagues, in-service training courses and scientific-technical conventions were ranked respectively as the three top communication channels used by respondents. There was a negative correlation between managers' years of extension work and their <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviour.</b> For specialists, a significant positive correlation was found between years of education and level of job satisfaction with their <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Conclusion. Providing valuable information sources, and removing information seeking barriers, can improve <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> of extension specialists and managers...|$|E

40|$|There are {{numerous}} user studies {{published in the}} literature and available on the web. There are studies that specifically address the behaviours of scholars while others identify the behaviours of the general public. Some studies address the <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviours</b> of scholars within specific disciplines while others identify the behaviours of scholars of multiple disciplines. There are studies that only address undergraduate, graduate, or post graduate students or compare these individual groups’ <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviours</b> to those of scholars. Still other studies address the behaviors of young adults. In the interest of analysing and synthesising several user behaviour studies conducted in the US and the UK twelve studies were identified. These  12 selected studies were commissioned and/or supported by non-profit organisations and government agencies; therefore, they have little dependence upon the outcomes of the studies.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the undergraduate art and design students of The Open Window School of Visual Communication. A qualitative approach with case study strategy is followed. For sampling purposes The Open Window School of Visual Communication was selected. Various qualitative research methods and literature on <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> are explored. The data were collected through one-on-one interviews. The findings show that various factors influence the <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> of undergraduate art and design students. Aspects in the users’ personal environment, such as meaning, experience, skills, preferences, and actions, have a significant influence on their <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Further factors deriving from the students’ context that influence their <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> are curricula, tasks, people (lecturers, artists, designers), sources, and technology applied to accomplish tasks. All these contributing factors have their own sets of requirements with which the art students have to comply. In addition, the findings show that the students’ digital literacy skills influence their information literacy skills. The findings also show that the factors that influence The Open Window students’ <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> influence the library as information service, in terms of the library sources and services the students use.

40|$|Purpose – This study {{provides}} {{evidence on the}} actual <b>information‐seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> of students in a digital scholarly environment, not what they thought they did. It also compares student <b>information‐seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> with that of other academic communities, and, in some cases, for practitioners. Design/methodology/approach – Data were gathered as part of CIBER's ongoing Virtual Scholar programme. In particular log data from two digital journals libraries, Blackwell Synergy and OhioLINK, and one e‐book collection (Oxford Scholarship Online) are utilized. Findings – The study showed a distinctive form of <b>information‐seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> associated with students and differences between them {{and other members of}} the academic community. For example, students constituted the biggest users in terms of sessions and pages viewed, and they were more likely to undertake longer online sessions. Undergraduates and postgraduates were the most likely users of library links to access scholarly databases, suggesting an important “hot link” role for libraries.

40|$|This paper applies {{a virtue}} {{epistemology}} approach {{to using the}} Internet, as to improve our <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Virtue epistemology focusses on the cognitive character of agents and is less concerned {{with the nature of}} truth and epistemic justification as compared to traditional analytic epistemology. Due to this focus on cognitive character and agency, it is a fruitful but underexplored approach to using the Internet in an epistemically desirable way. Thus, the central question in this paper is: How to use the Internet in an epistemically virtuous way? Using the work of Jason Baehr, it starts by outlining nine intellectual or epistemic virtues: curiosity, intellectual autonomy, intellectual humility, attentiveness, intellectual carefulness, intellectual thoroughness, open-mindedness, intellectual courage and intellectual tenacity. It then explores how we should deploy these virtues and avoid the corresponding vices when interacting with the Internet, particularly search engines. Whilst an epistemically virtuous use of the Internet will not guarantee that one will acquire true beliefs, understanding or even knowledge, it will strongly improve one’s <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviours.</b> The paper ends with arguing that teaching and assessing online intellectual virtues should be part of school and university curricula, perhaps embedded in critical thinking courses, or even better, as individual units...|$|R

40|$|Several {{researchers}} {{have suggested that}} the <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviours</b> of patients need to be taken into consideration when assessing their information needs. This study reviews published evidence of the psychometric properties of the Miller Behavioural Style Scale, a tool commonly used to identify the <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviours</b> of individuals under threat, and examines its reliability and validity with adult daughters of women with early breast cancer. Ninety-seven adult daughters completed the MBSS and a 30 -item, self-administered questionnaire, a tool designed to explore the information needs of adult daughters of women with breast cancer. The internal consistency of the monitoring and blunting sub-scales of the MBSS was α= 0 · 65 and 0 · 41 respectively. The blunting sub-scale fell substantially below acceptable limits and was discarded from subsequent analyses. The monitoring sub-scale possessed good test-retest reliability (n= 17) with a 5 -week time interval (r= 0 · 71, P < 0 · 005), as measured using a Pearson's correlation coefficient. Furthermore, the majority (73 · 4 %) of monitoring items possessed moderate or substantial test-retest reliability, as indicated by kappa coefficients. Finally, the monitoring sub-scale possessed good construct validity, both discriminant and convergent validity, as measured by the univariate associations between monitoring behaviour and selected items from the information questionnaire and a demographic questionnaire. In conclusion, adequate support exists for the psychometric properties of the monitoring sub-scale of the MBSS and its use with adult daughters of women with early breast cancer in future research. These findings have a number of implications for nursing research and these are discussed in this paper...|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} {{findings from}} Master’s research that investigated the <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviours</b> {{of engineers and}} scientists in the workplace. The objectives of this research were to establish where engineers and scientists look for information, consider their search preferences and determine the understanding they have of online search engine operation. There is limited current research in these areas looking at engineers and scientists in the workplace. The research was undertaken using a mixed methods research methodology. A survey was conducted with engineers and scientists working in the UK, using an online questionnaire and interviews to obtain quantitative and qualitative data. Due to {{the small sample size}} (115 : 58 engineers, 57 scientists) this research does not make generalisations about the wider population. The research showed both similarities and differences between engineers’ and scientists’ <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviours.</b> The most popular resources used by both engineers and scientists were online search engines, specialist databases and scholar search engines; and the most used sources were from within their own organisation (colleagues and documents). Electronic versions of sources were preferred over print because of their searchability; however, when an item was found it was often printed out to read. Although the main focus of this research was not information literacy it is suggested that there are significant gaps in the understanding of search engine functionality by both engineers and scientists, even though it is the most heavily used resource for information seeking. Whilst this research does not make generalisations about the wider engineer and scientist populations, potential implications for information professionals working with these groups are considered...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Information-seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> is {{necessary}} to improve knowledge on diabetes therapy and complications. Combined with other self-management skills and autonomous handling of the disease, {{it is essential for}} achieving treatment targets. However, a systematic review addressing this topic is lacking. The aims of this systematic review were to identify and analyse existing knowledge of information-seeking behaviour: (1) types <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviour,</b> (2) information sources, (3) the content of searched information, and (4) associated variables that may affect <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Methods The systematic review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) requirements. MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CCMed, ERIC, Journals@OVID, Deutsches Ärzteblatt and Karlsruher virtueller Katalog (KvK) databases were searched. Publications dealing with <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> of people with diabetes mellitus published up to June 2015 were included. A forward citation tracking was performed in September 2016 and June 2017. Additionally, an update of the two main databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL) was conducted, considering studies published up to July 2017. Studies published in languages other than English or German were excluded, as well as letters, short reports, editorials, comments and discussion papers. A study selection and the critical appraisal of the selected studies were performed independently by two reviewers. A third reviewer was consulted if any disagreement was found. Data extraction and content analysis were performed using selected dimensions of Wilson’s ‘model of information behaviour’. Results Twenty-six studies were included. Five ‘types of information-seeking behaviour’ were identified, e. g. passive and active search. The ‘Internet’ and ‘healthcare professionals’ were the most frequently reported sources. ‘Diet’, ‘complications’, ‘exercise’ and ‘medications and pharmacological interactions’ were the most frequently identified content of information. Seven main categories including associated variables were identified, e. g. ‘socioeconomic’, ‘duration of DM’, and ‘lifestyle’. Conclusion The systematic review provides a valuable overview of available knowledge on the <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> of people with diabetes mellitus, although {{there are only a few}} studies. There was a high heterogeneity regarding the research question, design, methods and participants. Although the Internet is often used to seek information, health professionals still play an important role in supporting their patients’ <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Specific needs of people with diabetes must be taken into consideration.

40|$|In {{literature}} it {{has been}} suggested that there are certain special and critical transitions in life that my have a long-term impact on health and health behaviours in later periods of the life course. This is also known as the Life Course Perspective (LCP). The purpose of this thesis was to contribute to the rationale of healthy nutrition promotion activities aimed at women and their health behaviour in and around pregnancy, as such a special and critical transition in life. This was done by means of cross-sectional studies on nutrition awareness (qualitative and quantitative), nutrition-related <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviours</b> (qualitative) and underlying motivations (qualitative) among women before, during and after their pregnancy. In order to do this, the concept of nutrition awareness was explored and redefined. Mostly, awareness is defined as a matter of knowing about something. The result of this conceptualisation is that the link with behaviour becomes a problematic one. Therefore, we have chosen for a more ‘active’. Nutrition awareness was defines as in saliency, preoccupation and supervision of nutrition. Furthermore, we looked at the autonomy of motivations of nutrition awareness. Autonomously motivated women in the period around the pregnancy are more likely to make longer lasting behavioural changes, which is favour of the LCP. Finally, special attention was paid to nutrition communication in the midwifery practice as a more specific setting for healthy nutrition promotion directed at all pregnant women. The results of these studies showed that the LCP is a new and hardly or insufficient explored domain in nutrition promotion and pregnancy. It can be concluded that the LCP-concept provides interesting opportunities for healthy nutrition promotion directed at women who are starting a family. In transition to pregnancy and motherhood, women are motivated to change health-related behaviours that are difficult to modify at other times. Moreover, it can be concluded that our conceptualisation of awareness is fruitful in obtaining a better understanding of possible behavioural changes in health in relation to the LCP. Also nutrition awareness, nutrition-related <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviours</b> and associated motivations are a good basis for distinguishing groups of women in the period around their pregnancy. ...|$|R

Objectives The present paper considered the following: (1) how decision-making style is associated with use and dependence upon commonly used stimulants and (2) how it influences behavioural responses to electronic offers of further information about these drugs. Method An online survey examined patterns of nicotine and caffeine use, administered Severity of Dependence Scales for caffeine and nicotine and assessed decision-making style using the Melbourne Decision Making Questionnaire and mood using the Kessler Distress Scale. Upon completing these scales, the 181 participants with a mean age of 28. 14 years were offered further information online. Results Stimulant dependence was associated with psychological distress. Caffeine dependence was linked to hypervigilance (panic). Decisional self-esteem varied with stimulant dependence and Kessler Distress Scale score. Participants with high decisional self-esteem declined electronic offers of further information.

40|$|Background: Manufacturing {{companies}} in Nigeria {{operate in a}} turbulent business environment and managers therein need quality information to operate with keen market competition. Information seeking behavior and use as well as knowledge sharing are critical ingredients to enhance innovation capability of managers in business organisations like manufacturing companies for survival. Objectives: This study examines the contributions of <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviour,</b> information utilation and knowledge sharing {{to the prediction of}} the innovation capability of managers in large-scale manufacturing {{companies in}} Nigeria with special reference to the food, beverages and tobacco companies. Method: A total enumeration technique was used to administer copies of a questionnaire to a population of 400 managers in 12 food, beverages and tobacco companies that are listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Of these, 357 responded. The response rate achieved was 89. 3 %. Results: The study found that there were significant multiple relationships between <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviour,</b> information utilisation, knowledge sharing and the innovation capability of the respondents. It was also found that <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviour,</b> information utilisation and knowledge sharing jointly and individually predict the innovation capability of the respondents. In addition, <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> contributed 22. 18 %, information utilisation contributed 44. 12 %, and knowledge sharing contributed 40. 88 % to the prediction of innovation capability of managers in food, beverages and tobacco companies in Nigeria. The study equally found that, apart from the traditional ways of sharing knowledge in organisations, social media technology such as Facebook and Twitter, amongst others, are new ways of sharing knowledge in large-scale manufacturing companies in Nigeria. Conclusion: The study recommends that managers in these companies should be encouraged to seek for more information, make more intensive use of information and share knowledge in order to improve their innovation capability. </p...|$|E

40|$|Objectives ‐ To {{gain insight}} into {{the extent to which}} user <b>information‐seeking</b> <b>behaviours</b> should inform the design and {{development}} of Digital Libraries in an academic setting, a study was carried out at Dalhousie University, Canada to explore the <b>information‐seeking</b> <b>behaviours</b> of business students. Methods ‐ The students studied were drawn from the School of Business Administration at Dalhousie University, Canada. The study was based on qualitative and quantitative data collected through a survey, in‐depth semi‐structured interviews, observational study and document analysis. Qualitative case study data was coded using QSR N 6 qualitative data analysis software. The data was categorized using Atkinson’s “Model of BusinessInformation Users’ Expectations” and Renda and Straccia‘s personalized collaborative DL model. Atkinson’s model defines the expectations of business students in terms of cost, time,effort required, pleasure and the avoidance of pain. Renda and Straccia’s model of a personalized and collaborative digital library centres around three concepts: actors, objects, and functionality. The survey data was analysed using the Zoomerang software. Results ‐ The study results revealed that students tend to select resources based on cost(free or for fee), accessibility, ease of use, speed of delivery (of results), and convenience. The results showed that similar to Atkinson’s findings, the business students’ information seeking behaviour is influenced by the concepts of cost‐benefit and break‐even analyses that underlie business education. Concerning speed of delivery and convenience, the organization of the resources was paramount. Students preferred user‐defined resource lists, alert services, and expert‐created business resource collections. When asked about the usefulness of potential digital library functionalities, students valued a personalized user interface and communal virtual spaces to share information and communicate in real‐time with their peers. Conclusion ‐ This study reveals that when digital libraries are developed, user behaviours and needs should be taken into consideration. It demonstrates that the activity as well as the “user’s orientation and motivation” (here the business student training) can directly influence the design and use of a digital tool. In other words, this study confirms a new typology of a business digital information user or use behaviour, one that requires the building of dedicated accredited library research systems. Providing information and information tools tailored to this specific audience is more likely to increase the appeal and use of an academic business digital library...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{establish}} the <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviours</b> of paediatricians in answering every-day clinical queries. DESIGN: A questionnaire was distributed to every hospital-based paediatrician (paediatric registrar and consultant) working in Ireland. RESULTS: The study received 156 completed questionnaires, a 66. 1 % response. 67 % of paediatricians utilised {{the internet as}} their first "port of call" when looking to answer a medical question. 85 % believe that web-based resources have improved medical practice, with 88 % reporting web-based resources are essential for medical practice today. 93. 5 % of paediatricians believe attempting to answer clinical questions as they arise {{is an important component}} in practising evidence-based medicine. 54 % of all paediatricians have recommended websites to parents or patients. 75. 5 % of paediatricians report finding it difficult to keep up-to-date with new information relevant to their practice. CONCLUSIONS: Web-based paediatric resources are of increasing significance in day-to-day clinical practice. Many paediatricians now believe that the quality of patient care depends on it. Information technology resources {{play a key role in}} helping physicians to deliver, in a time-efficient manner, solutions to clinical queries at the point of care...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: There {{is now a}} {{small but}} growing body of {{evidence}} to demonstrate that LGBTQ library patrons often have specific and distinct information needs and <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviours</b> (Beiringer and Jackson, 2007; Schaller, 2011; Morris and Roberto, 2016). Many academic libraries are recognizing these specific needs and making increasing efforts to meet them, informed by new diversity statements and plans. However, these efforts are far from universal. Given the increased attention and awareness of LGBTQ issues, librarians must be equipped to assist researchers and consumers with LGBTQ-themed inquiries. A number of studies have been conducted with physicians, mental health counselors, and other health professionals regarding LGBTQ knowledge and training needs. However, {{there is a lack of}} research in this area pertaining to librarians. To address this gap, the authors have conducted a survey into the knowledge and comfort level of academic librarians across the US and Canada towards these specific needs and towards the efforts of libraries to better serve their LGBTQ patrons. In this poster, we report the results and subsequent analysis of a web-based survey of respondents' knowledge and comfort level. [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Research {{into the}} <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviours</b> {{and needs of}} {{alternative}} and complementary health professionals continues to be limited. Interest in complementary medicine is growing worldwide, reflected in New Zealand by the increase in numbers of practitioners, {{and the demand for}} accessible, reliable information and resources by professionals and consumers grows also. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the information seeking behaviours (access, sources, frequency of search, and motivation) and needs (research, practice or education) of students and professionals in one area of complementary health (chiropractic), and by investigating their reported practices and preferences identify their requirements, preferred approaches and any barriers that may limit their information-seeking. The intention is to use the information to assess a possible requirement for information services and information skills programmes for practitioners in the community and to add to the small body of research on information use among CAM professionals. Methods: The research project surveyed a random sample of both students and registered chiropractic practitioners by questionnaire and interview. The mailed questionnaire included twenty question intended to elicit information on the <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviours</b> of the respondents, with interview questions expanding on these responses. Results: Although the response was very low at 41. 1 %, (a known risk in survey research), results indicated that the information needs and behaviours of chiropractic professionals is similar to that of other health professionals. Respondents used the Internet and books frequently, but were unlikely to use databases or a library when seeking information. Respondents were generally confident in their skills but often lacked confidence in the information they located. Conclusions: Although the chiropractic field is quite narrow in scope, chiropractors' information seeking needs and behaviours are similar to those of other health professionals. They seek information regularly and use a number of sources, primarily for clinical reasons and for personal interest. They do not search for research-based information frequently and rely on the Internet, colleagues and their own collections to supply their main information needs. Although the results cannot reliably be extrapolated to the whole chiropractic community owing to the small scale of the survey, it appears that there is need to encourage the use of research-based information and to provide easier access to those resources contained in databases and libraries. As the overwhelming majority of chiropractors of all levels of experience use the Internet, the investigation of the provision of targeted web-based services and training in their use may be profitable. More precise investigation is required...|$|R
40|$|Taking a {{quantitative}} approach, this research surveyed Chinese migrants in Canada regarding channels {{they rely on}} to seek various information. This research also investigates how Chinese migrants’ preferences of channels correlate with their intercultural sensitivity level. Chinese migrants prefer Chinese newspapers and websites for government/policy information and life information rather than English newspapers and websites. However, they use English newspapers and websites more frequently for job and career development information. Overall, English television and radio are more frequently used by Chinese migrants than Chinese television and radio broadcasts. The intercultural sensitivity levels of Chinese migrants have a positive correlation with their frequencies of using English information resources, including government websites, English newspapers, English non-government websites, government officers, personal non-Chinese social networks, and English television and radio. Findings of this research suggest that Chinese ethnic media {{play an important role}} in Chinese migrants’ <b>information-seeking</b> <b>behaviours</b> and patterns in Canada. On one hand, government and other organizations can reach the Chinese migrant community through information diffusion in Chinese ethnic media. On the other hand, Chinese migrants should make an active effort to improve their English proficiency and intercultural communication sensitivity to better integrate themselves into the Canadian society. A more balanced approach of seeking information from English and Chinese media sources could be more beneficial for Chinese migrants...|$|R
