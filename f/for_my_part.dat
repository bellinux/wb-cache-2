5|$|According to {{the view}} that is {{widespread}} among the Russian music public, I am associated with the party that is antagonistic to the one living Russian composer I love and value above all others—Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.... In a word, despite our different musical identities, it would seem we are following a single path; and I, <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>part,</b> am proud to have such a fellow traveler.... Lyadov and Glazunov are also numbered among my opponents, yet I sincerely love and value their talent.|$|E
5|$|I am vexed and {{surprised}} at your not thinking {{the situation of}} Maria sufficiently important, and can only account for this want of – shall I say it? delicacy of feeling, by recollecting {{that you are a}} man – <b>For</b> <b>my</b> <b>part</b> I cannot suppose any situation more distressing than for a woman of sensibility with an improving mind to be bound, to such a man as I have described, for life – obliged to renounce all the humanizing affections, and to avoid cultivating her taste lest her perception of grace, and refinement of sentiment should sharpen to agony the pangs of disappointment.|$|E
5|$|I {{have come}} to {{know that there is a}} real {{difference}} between the regular German soldier and officer and Hitler and his criminal group. <b>For</b> <b>my</b> <b>part,</b> I do not believe that the German soldier as such has lost his honor. The fact that certain individuals committed in war dishonorable and despicable acts reflects on the individuals concerned and not on the great majority of German soldiers and officers.|$|E
60|$|Stein {{had drawn}} his sword, and he waved it at me. <b>For</b> <b>my</b> own <b>part</b> I was {{determined}} not to give myself up.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then Cornwallis is, doubtless, keeping well up to Brest, though, <b>for</b> <b>my</b> own <b>part,</b> I had rather tempt {{them out}} into the open sea." ...|$|R
60|$|PRINCE PAUL. Yes; {{if that is}} {{not meant}} as an extra punishment. <b>For</b> <b>my</b> own <b>part,</b> at least, I find these Cabinet Councils {{extremely}} exhausting.|$|R
5|$|Physical {{objects are}} conceptually {{imported}} {{into the situation}} as convenient intermediaries not by definition in terms of experience, but simply as irreducible posits comparable, epistemologically, to the gods of Homer... <b>For</b> <b>my</b> <b>part</b> I do, qua lay physicist, believe in physical objects and not in Homer's gods; and I consider it a scientific error to believe otherwise. But in point of epistemological footing, the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree and not in kind. Both sorts of entities enter our conceptions only as cultural posits.|$|E
25|$|Alessandro Lessona (Minister of Mussolini's government), {{a friend}} of mine at the time, paid to you more than 4 million English Pounds from 1925 to 1931. Even I had the right to act, I never asked <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>part.</b> That money, as anyone in Albania knows, have been washed by the blood of patriots as Bajram Curri, Hasan Prishtina, Luigj Gurakuqi, and {{thousand}} of them.|$|E
25|$|They {{are trying}} to persuade me to let my boy be inoculated with smallpox. But as I have {{expressed}} sufficiently clearly my aversion to this impertinence they are leaving me in peace. Here inoculation is the general fashion. But <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>part</b> I leave the matter to the grace of God. It depends on His grace whether He wishes to keep this prodigy of nature in this world in which He placed it or {{to take it to}} Himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! you are young. My {{daughter}} {{also has}} a wonderful memory. <b>For</b> <b>my</b> own <b>part,</b> {{there are many things}} which I am not sorry to forget." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>my</b> own <b>part,</b> not {{to speak}} of a few private and {{personal}} ends, I really desired our old mother's prolonged existence for her own dear sake.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pooh! nonsense!" [...] {{said the}} old gentleman, rising; [...] "ghosts can’t hurt you. <b>For</b> <b>my</b> own <b>part,</b> I should rather like to see one. Good night, gentlemen." ...|$|R
25|$|I John Audubon, {{having this}} day mutual consent with Ferdinand Rozier, {{dissolved}} and forever closed the partnership and firm of Audubon and Rozier, and having Received from said Ferdinand Rozier payment and notes {{to the full}} amount of my part of the goods and debts of the late firm of Audubon and Rozier, I the said John Audubon one of the firm aforesaid do hereby release and forever quit claim to all and any interest which I have or may have in the stock on hand and debts due to the late firm of Audubon and Rozier assign, transfer and set over to said Ferdinand Rozier, all my rights, titles, claims and interest in the goods, merchandise and debts due to the late firm of Audubon and Rozier, and do hereby authorize and empower him <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>part,</b> to collect the same in any manner what ever either privately or by suit or suits in law or equity hereby declaring him sole and absolute proprietor and rightful owner of all goods, merchandise and debts of this firm aforesaid, as completely as they were the goods and property of the late firm Audubon and Rozier.|$|E
500|$|..... how so many learned heads should so farre {{forget their}} Metaphysicks, {{and destroy the}} ladder and scale of creatures, as to {{question}} the existence of Spirits: <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>part,</b> I have ever beleeved, and doe now know, that there are Witches; ...|$|E
500|$|Eight years later, Dr. B. Brookes Lee {{was arrested}} in Portland, Oregon. He {{had been accused of}} {{treating}} Sharkey to make it appear that he had been fouled by Fitzsimmons. Lee admitted it was true. [...] "I fixed Sharkey up to look {{as if he had been}} fouled. How? Well, that is something I do not care to reveal, but I will assert that it was done—that is enough. There is no doubt that Fitzsimmons was entitled to the decision and did not foul Sharkey. I got $1,000 <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>part</b> in the affair." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ho!' was {{his next}} interjection, 'so much the worse. <b>For</b> <b>my</b> own <b>part,</b> I don't expect {{prudence}} {{will come to}} you naturally till the little Awk has a lover.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Those {{have been}} stained and killed," [...] said the Bacteriologist. [...] "I wish, <b>for</b> <b>my</b> own <b>part,</b> we could kill and stain {{every one of}} them in the universe." ...|$|R
6000|$|Theo. <b>For</b> <b>my</b> own <b>part,</b> I {{have been}} {{consulting}} {{with him about}} some particulars of my fortunes past and future; both which he has resolved me with that admirable knowledge---- ...|$|R
500|$|According to Christopher Tolkien, it is {{no longer}} {{possible}} to trace the exact date of the work's composition. On the basis of circumstantial evidence, he suggests that it dates from the 1930s. In his foreword he wrote, [...] "He scarcely ever (to my knowledge) referred to them. <b>For</b> <b>my</b> <b>part,</b> I cannot recall any conversation with him on the subject until very {{near the end of his}} life, when he spoke of them to me, and tried unsuccessfully to find them." [...] In a 1967 letter to W. H. Auden, Tolkien wrote, ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{critical}} {{reception of}} Barbara Gordon's evolution into Oracle {{have been mixed}} among critics and other observers, according to John Ostrander: [...] "We have, over the years, on those occasions when I have worked with the character, gotten some letters {{from those who have}} disabilities of one stripe or another and all have been very supportive. I feel very proud <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>part</b> in creating Oracle." [...] Supporters of Oracle argue that the Barbara Gordon character provides a greater service to DC Comics and its readers as a disabled character, regardless of the events that caused her paralysis. In her persona as Oracle, Barbara Gordon {{is not limited to the}} Batman Family, serving a unique and universal role in the DC universe. DC Senior Vice President Dan DiDio comments, [...] "Some stories... are so strong that undoing them would be a crime. The DCU would be a lesser place without Barry's sacrifice, or the crippling of Barbara at the hands of the Joker." ...|$|E
500|$|Extant {{biographies of}} Epaminondas universally {{describe}} {{him as one of}} the most talented generals ever produced by the Greek city-states. Even Xenophon, who fails to note his presence at Leuctra, says of his Mantinean campaign: [...] "Now I <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>part</b> could not say that his campaign proved fortunate; yet of all possible deeds of forethought and daring the man seems to me to have left not one undone." [...] Diodorus is effusive in his praise for Epaminondas's military record: [...] "For it seems to me that he surpassed his contemporaries...in skill and experience in the art of war. For among the generation of Epaminondas were famous men: Pelopidas the Theban, [...] Timotheus and Conon, also Chabrias and Iphicrates...Agesilaus the Spartan, who belonged to a slightly older generation. Still earlier than these, in the times of the Medes and Persians, there were Solon, Themistocles, Miltiades, and Cimon, Myronides, and Pericles and certain others in Athens, and in Sicily Gelon, son of Deinomenes, and still others. All the same, if you should compare the qualities of these with the generalship and reputation of Epaminondas, you would find the qualities possessed by Epaminondas far superior".|$|E
60|$|Duke. I rather envy {{you than}} blame you: Our sleep is {{certainly}} the most pleasant portion of our lives. <b>For</b> <b>my</b> own <b>part,</b> I spent the night waking and restless.|$|R
6000|$|... 'When we conquer it. Not Scherirah. Mark my words, Ithamar: {{he never}} {{will have a}} government. You or I perchance. <b>For</b> <b>my</b> own <b>part,</b> I would rather remain as I am.' ...|$|R

500|$|After Alexander's {{death in}} 323BC, Demosthenes again urged the Athenians to seek {{independence}} from Macedon in {{what became known}} as the Lamian War. However, Antipater, Alexander's successor, quelled all opposition and demanded that the Athenians turn over Demosthenes and Hypereides, among others. Following his request, the ecclesia adopted a decree condemning the most prominent anti-Macedonian agitators to death. Demosthenes escaped to a sanctuary on the island of Kalaureia (modern-day Poros), where he was later discovered by Archias, a confidant of Antipater. He committed suicide before his capture by taking poison out of a reed, pretending he wanted to write a letter to his family. When Demosthenes felt that the poison was working on his body, he said to Archias: [...] "Now, as soon as you please you may commence the part of Creon in the tragedy, and cast out this body of mine unburied. But, O gracious Neptune, I, <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>part,</b> while I am yet alive, arise up and depart out of this sacred place; though Antipater and the Macedonians have not left so much as the temple unpolluted." [...] After saying these words, he passed by the altar, fell down and died. Years after Demosthenes's suicide, the Athenians erected a statue to honour him and decreed that the state should provide meals to his descendants in the Prytaneum.|$|E
500|$|His pleas were in vain. [...] Three days later, Digby, Robert Wintour, John Grant and Thomas Bates were hanged, {{drawn and}} {{quartered}} {{at the western}} end of St Paul's churchyard. [...] The following day, Rookwood, Thomas Wintour, Robert Keyes and Guy Fawkes were tied to wattled hurdles and dragged by horse from the Tower, to the Old Palace Yard at Westminster—a longer route than had been suffered by their fellow conspirators. [...] Rookwood had asked to be informed when he passed by his lodgings in the Strand, so that he could open his eyes and see his wife, waiting at the window. [...] He shouted [...] "Pray for me, pray for me!" [...] According to Father Gerard (who was not then present), Elizabeth answered, [...] "I will, and be of good courage. [...] Offer theyself wholly to God. [...] I, <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>part,</b> do as freely restore thee to God as He gave thee unto me." [...] For the rest of the journey he kept his eyes closed, in prayer. [...] Thomas Wintour was the first that day to be hanged and then killed. [...] Rookwood was next, and made a short speech to the assembled audience. [...] He was repentant, asking God to bless the king, queen, and their [...] "royal progeny", but [...] "spoil all the pottage with one filthy weed" [...] by beseeching God to make the king a Catholic. [...] Nevertheless, he seems to have been left to hang for longer than the others, before suffering the remainder of his grim sentence.|$|E

6000|$|... "I'll better do't {{to please}} her," [...] said Hendry, [...] "though <b>for</b> <b>my</b> ain <b>part</b> I dinna like the feel o' a dickey on week-days. Na, they mak's think it's the Sabbath." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Whatever it is, it is white-face work," [...] {{said the}} Adjutant; [...] "and <b>for</b> <b>my</b> own <b>part,</b> I would not lie out upon a place so near {{to it as}} this bar." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At least," [...] laughed the Vicomte at length, [...] "he lacks not <b>for</b> champions. <b>For</b> <b>my</b> own <b>part,</b> I am {{content to}} pray Heaven that he come not to Lavedan, as he intended." ...|$|R
2500|$|Another work of Vaughan's {{that clearly}} {{parallels}} George Herbert is Mount of Olives, e. g., the passage, [...] "Let sensual natures judge as they please, but <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>part,</b> I shall hold it no paradoxe to affirme, {{there are no}} pleasures in the world. Some coloured griefes of blushing woes there are, which look as clear {{as if they were}} true complexions; but it is very sad and tyred truth, that they are but painted." [...] This echoes Herbert's Rose: ...|$|E
2500|$|Writing on 25 January 1798 to a friend, Fitzwilliam {{claimed his}} {{objections}} to the Foxites stemmed not mainly because of their advocacy of peace with France but over their support for parliamentary reform, which [...] "will truly frenchify us: <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>part</b> I have nothing less at heart than to be frenchified. In February the King offered him the Lord Lieutenancy of the West Riding of Yorkshire after the Duke of Norfolk was relieved of it after his toast to [...] "Our sovereign—the Majesty of the People". Fitzwilliam accepted {{on the condition that}} it was to be publicly known that the offer came from the King and not the government.|$|E
2500|$|As an empiricist I {{continue}} {{to think of}} the conceptual scheme of science as a tool, ultimately, for predicting future experience in the light of past experience. Physical objects are conceptually imported into the situation as convenient intermediaries not by definition in terms of experience, but simply as irreducible posits comparable, epistemologically, to the gods of Homer [...] [...] [...] <b>For</b> <b>my</b> <b>part</b> I do, qua lay physicist, believe in physical objects and not in Homer's gods; and I consider it a scientific error to believe otherwise. But in point of epistemological footing, the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree and not in kind. Both sorts of entities enter our conceptions only as cultural posits.|$|E
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>my</b> own <b>part,</b> I {{think it}} highly {{probable}} {{that the story}} of Fisher's Ghost was told before the magistrates, as in the Buckinghamshire case, and was suppressed in the trial at Sydney.|$|R
60|$|Then the familiars of the Holy Office {{assisted}} me {{to resume}} my garments; and all was done now in utter silence, and <b>for</b> <b>my</b> own <b>part</b> {{in the same}} mental and dream-like confusion.|$|R
6000|$|Aur. Sir, {{you are an}} unfit {{judge of}} your own merits: <b>For</b> <b>my</b> own <b>part,</b> I confess, I have a furious {{inclination}} for the occult sciences; but at present, 'tis my misfortune---- [...] [Sighs.|$|R
