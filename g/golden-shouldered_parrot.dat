50|$|The {{park has}} been {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports a large population of up to a thousand endangered <b>golden-shouldered</b> <b>parrots.</b> Feral pigs destroy the parrots' nesting mounds and reduce the bird's food source. When conditions allow the pigs population to grow significantly the animal is culled by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service.|$|R
50|$|Threatened species {{which are}} found in the park include the <b>golden-shouldered</b> <b>parrot,</b> star finch, red goshawk, Lakeland Downs mouse and the spectacled hare-wallaby. Termite mounds are {{scattered}} across the park, particularly on the Niland Plain.|$|E
50|$|The Dixie {{pastoral}} {{station is}} within the locality. It was purchased by the Queensland Government in August 2012. Part of the land will {{be made into a}} conservation area to protect the habitat of the endangered <b>golden-shouldered</b> <b>parrot.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Alwal National Park {{is home to}} some of {{last known}} populations of the <b>Golden-shouldered</b> <b>parrot,</b> one of Australia's most {{endangered}} bird species. The park also protects the habitat of the threatened Cape York rock-wallaby, red goshawk and black-necked stork.|$|E
50|$|The <b>golden-shouldered</b> <b>parrot</b> {{is listed}} as {{endangered}} (CITES I), with population surveys pointing to a total wild population of around 2,000 birds with around 300 breeding pairs. The remaining majority of birds {{are thought to be}} juvenile birds in their first year of life.|$|E
5000|$|More specifically, {{while this}} ecologically diverse river system is {{relatively}} poorly studied, {{it is known}} to contain at least 18 rare, endangered or vulnerable animal species including the <b>golden-shouldered</b> <b>parrot,</b> the Gouldian finch and the northern bettong. [...] The mouth of the river lies in the Gulf Plains Important Bird Area.|$|E
50|$|One {{of three}} species known as antbed parrots, the hooded parrot {{is closely related}} to (and {{sometimes}} considered a subspecies of) the <b>golden-shouldered</b> <b>parrot</b> (Psephotus chrysopterygius). A genetic study revealed its ancestors most likely diverged from ancestors of the latter species in the late Miocene or early Pliocene {{at the conclusion of the}} 'Hill Gap'.|$|E
50|$|The <b>golden-shouldered</b> <b>parrot</b> is 23-28 cm {{long and}} weighs 54-56 g. The adult male is mainly blue {{and has a}} {{characteristic}} yellow over the shoulder area. It has a black cap and pale yellow frontal band. It has an extended dark salmon pink lower belly, thighs and undertail-coverts. It has a grey-brown lower back.|$|E
50|$|The <b>golden-shouldered</b> <b>parrot</b> (Psephotellus chrysopterygius) {{is a rare}} bird of {{southern}} Cape York Peninsula, in Queensland, Australia. A small parrot related to the more common red-rumped parrot, it {{is considered to be}} a superspecies with the hooded parrot (P. dissimilis) of the Northern Territory and the apparently extinct paradise parrot of Queensland and New South Wales.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} broadly {{distributed}} in Australia, occuping {{most of the}} continent except for the eastern margin.It is mainly sedentary, remaining in arid and semi- arid areas even during dry conditions.It can also be partly nomadic. It prefers open eucalypt woodlands, scrub, and spinifex in arid and semi-arid conditions.In tropical savannah, it prefers open woodlands and grasslands.It frequently flocks with finches and at times the <b>golden-shouldered</b> <b>parrot.</b>|$|E
50|$|The male {{hooded parrot}} can be {{distinguished}} from the similar looking male <b>golden-shouldered</b> <b>parrot</b> mainly {{by the absence of}} a pale frontal band, a larger yellow patch on the wings, and absence of the red on the abdomen. The female is very similar to the female Yellow-shouldered parrot being identified by the absence of a pale frontal band and an absence of red on the abdomen.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the current}} {{conservation}} status of black-faced woodswallow is least concern, {{there have been}} significant regional declines, particularly on the Cape York Peninsula. These losses {{are thought to be}} due to vegetation thickening.However, a recent change in fire management, specifically storm-burning, has resulted in a cessation of woodswallow decline.Storm-burning has produced a more open vegetation structure, which is beneficial for insect feeding and nesting by the woodswallows. Storm-burning is therefore thought to be essential for persistence of black-faced woodswallow habitat in the Cape York Peninsula. This also assists <b>golden-shouldered</b> <b>parrot</b> conservation by reducing their predation risk.|$|E
50|$|On the Cape York Peninsula, the black-faced woodswallows {{associate}} with golden-shouldered parrots and finches,which has important {{consequences for the}} endangered parrots. The woodswallow nesting sites occur closer to more open areas, on gravel slopes and glimmer grass flats. The adults frequently feed on insects on the ground, but are also efficient at defending their territory against predators, which is also beneficial for parrots feeding nearby.However woodswallows numbers have declined since 1993 in Cape York Peninsular. This loss {{has been attributed to}} vegetation thickening as a result of inappropriate fire regimes, which has contributed to increased predation of the <b>golden-shouldered</b> <b>parrot.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>golden-shouldered</b> <b>parrot</b> {{lives in}} open forested {{grassland}} liberally populated by numerous termite species and their mounds. Often these mounds are found every few metres apart. The parrot feeds on {{the seeds of}} small grass species and several months of the year, principally those prior to {{the onset of the}} wet season, the birds are almost entirely dependent on the small but plentiful seed of firegrass (Schizachyrium fragile). An important habitat requirement is the presence of suitably sized terrestrial termite mounds, in which the birds nest. This has led to the Golden shouldered parrot and its relatives being known as the antbed parrots.|$|E
5000|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports {{a large proportion of}} the population of the endangered <b>golden-shouldered</b> <b>parrot,</b> and possibly of the buff-breasted button-quail. It also contains significant populations of black-throated and masked finches, bush stone-curlews, silver-crowned friarbirds, and yellow-tinted, yellow, banded, white-gaped and bar-breasted honeyeaters. [...] During the wet season azure kingfishers occur along the streams with rainforest birds such as fairy gerygones and pied imperial-pigeons. The wet grasslands are used by Latham's snipes on migration and by brolgas for nesting. Black-breasted buzzards sometimes nest in the IBA and red goshawks have been recorded there.|$|E
5000|$|The {{peninsula}} harbours {{an extraordinary}} biodiversity, {{with more than}} 700 vertebrate land animal species of which 40 are endemic. As a result, from its geological history, [...] "the flora and fauna of Cape York Peninsula are a complex mixture of Gondwanan relics, Australian isolationists and Asian or New Guinean invaders" [...] (p. 41). Birds of the peninsula include buff-breasted buttonquail (Turnix olivii), <b>golden-shouldered</b> <b>parrot</b> (Psephotus chrysopterygius), lovely fairywren (Malurus amabilis), white-streaked honeyeater (Trichodere cockerelli), and yellow-spotted honeyeater (Meliphaga notata) while some such as pied oystercatcher are found {{in other parts of}} Australia but have important populations on the peninsula. The peninsula is also home to the eastern brown snake, one of the world's most venomous snakes. Mammals include the rodent Cape York melomys, related to the extinct Bramble Cay melomys, which was found only on Bramble Cay in the Torres Strait and confirmed extinct in 2016.|$|E
50|$|The <b>golden-shouldered</b> <b>parrot</b> {{will build}} a nest in the taller {{magnetic}} termite mounds (up to 2 m high)but surveys point to the preference for the lower dome type mounds. This may be {{to do with the}} slower heating up and cooling of the smaller denser mounds.Commonly they dig a burrow into the mound when wet season rains have softened the substrate of the mounds. Typically a 50 -350 mm long tunnel is dug down into the mound ending in the nesting chamber. The clutch size is between 3-6 eggs, which are incubated for 20 days. The termite occupants of the mound use a natural form of airconditioning to preserve the climatic conditions of their colony and this process regulates the temperature of the parrot's nest chamber at around 28-30 degrees C. Temperature surveys have shown however, a range of 13-35 degrees C. These conditions have led to the parrots developing a habit of leaving the eggs at night beginning around the 10th day after hatching. A symbiotic relationship is present between the Golden shouldered parrot and a moth species (Trisyntopa scatophaga) that is worthy of note. Found in around half of parrot nests, the moths seek out the newly dug nest tunnels and deposit their eggs in the entrance. The hatching moth larvae consume the faeces of the nestling parrots therefore helping to keep the nest chamber clean. Whether the parrots receive any other benefits from the presence of moths is arguable as not all nests contain moth larvae.|$|E
5000|$|The {{species has}} a {{restricted}} range and {{suffers from a}} variety of threats, including predation by feral cats, tourist disturbance as well as feral pigs which disturb and dig out nests. The main threat however has been the changes to traditional Aboriginal burning regimes in the grasslands upon whose seeds the birds depend. These so-called [...] "cool fires" [...] created a mosaic of burnt landscape allowing wildlife to move to remaining food resources and reveals fallen seed that is hidden by dried grass cover. Hot uncontrolled wildfires destroy all seed stores in the environment and favour the intrusion of teatree species into grassland habitats. The cover that is created by these thickets of teatree also allow the parrot's main predator, the pied butcherbird (Cracticus nigrogularis), a more successful kill rate on the parrots, primarily upon the juvenile population and adult males. A number of cases have been noted where a juvenile male has taken over the role of an adult male ( [...] that has been predated) and is feeding the chicks of that deceased male. This may be an adaptation to the increased rate of predation on adult males in comparison to females. In captivity it is noted that golden-shouldered parrots will readily accept a new partner and this may be related to this wild breeding behaviour. Sites identified by BirdLife International as being important for <b>golden-shouldered</b> <b>parrot</b> conservation are Morehead River and Staaten River. The ongoing conservation work of the owners of Artemis Station should also be noted. These graziers have been monitoring and providing conservation works on their property {{for the benefit of the}} Golden shouldered parrot since the 1970s. The reinstating of former burning practices and the temporary removal of cattle from prime breeding sites has aided the parrot's survival. The recent provision of feeding stations in order to help juvenile birds through the perilous first months of the wet season has also been undertaken. This period when heavy flooding rains results in any remaining seed being washed away or drowned and many young birds perish before newly sprouted grass can provide new seed. The conservation effort toward this species seems to be resulting in a stabilization of the population decline but no notable increase in numbers has been reported.|$|E

40|$|Extract] The <b>Golden-shouldered</b> <b>Parrot</b> Psephotus chrysopterygiusis {{listed as}} an Endangered species under Schedule 2 of the Queensland Nature Conservation (Wildlife) Regulation 1994, and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). The species fits the {{criteria}} of endangered under IUCN Red List categories (IUCN SSC 2001) : Category B 1 a,b(i) (ii) (iii) (iv) (extent of occurrence < 5000 sq. km, occurs at fewer than five locations, continuing projected decline in extent of occurrence, area of occupancy, quality of habitat, number of mature individuals; (Garnett & Crowley 2000)). It is listed under Appendix I of Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) (Garnett & Crowley 2002). The species occurs only on Cape York Peninsula in two areas totalling less than 2000 km 2 area of occupancy and ranging over less than 3, 000 km 2 extent of occurrence. The northern population is centred around Morehead River {{in an area of}} around 1, 380 km 2, and the southern one around the Staaten River in an area of around 400 km 2 (Fig 1). The population of adults is in the order of 2, 000 to 2, 300 birds, increasing possibly to 3, 600 adult and juvenile birds after the breeding season and declining back to the core population during the later dry season and wet season each year. Due to limited surveys and data, {{it is not clear whether}} or not the population is increasing, stable or declining. A Recovery Plan for the <b>golden-shouldered</b> <b>parrot</b> Psephotus chrysopterygius 2003 - 2007 (Garnett & Crowley 2002) was prepared in 2002 and included a number of objectives. This report responds to: Specific Objective 3 : Determine population trends. A Prospectus for the study, 'Re-assessment of the status of the <b>Golden-shouldered</b> <b>Parrot</b> Psephotus chrysopterygius', prepared for the Caring for Our Country grants provided the scope of the study (Appendix 1). Anticipated outcomes of the study were expected to be: A report documenting trends in the Morehead population of Golden-shouldered Parrots enabling a comparison to be made with population estimates in 1996 and 2001 and a reassessment of conservation status. GPS locations of all located nest sites for the 2009 breeding season. The work undertaken complies with this scope, and is described below. The contract (CY TBIO 01) for the study included two milestones: •A nest survey of the Morehead population during the late breeding season between March and May 2009 to ascertain whether the apparent reversal in the decline of the Morehead population has been maintained; •Observations of predation and nest damage, of flock sizes, sex ratios, number of juveniles together with presence/absence of Pied Butcherbirds and/or Black-faced Wood swallows. The survey was urgent as the previous survey was conducted about 8 years ago (2001) and should have been conducted within 5 years of the previous one. This project was funded by the Federal Government's Caring for Our Country program, and managed by the Queensland Government Dept of Environment & Natural Resource Management...|$|E
40|$|Cockatoo Grass fills an {{important}} role in the tropical savannas of Australia and elsewhere, providing food for seed-eating birds and small mammals, often at times when other foods are scarce or difficult to obtain. It can be considered a "keystone" species for at least two animal species that rely on it to survive when other foods are unavailable, the <b>Golden-shouldered</b> <b>Parrot</b> and Northern Bettong. Cockatoo Grass is also highly susceptible to overgrazing by pigs and cattle. Protection of healthy stands of Cockatoo Grass is therefore important for the conservation of biodiversity in the Australian savannas. While exclusion of cattle and pigs from important stands will allow the greatest development of plants and maximise seed production, healthy stands can also persist under recommended best practice pastoral management for Australian rangelands. This includes spelling native pastures from cattle grazing in the early wet season, and light to moderate pasture utilisation rates. In some circumstances, disturbance from fire may also be beneficial in allowing the species to compete with more vigorous grasses...|$|E
