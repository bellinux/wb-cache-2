5000|$|There is an over-representation of Aboriginal {{people in}} the {{criminal}} justice system in Australia. Aboriginal Australians in Western Australia comprise between 3 and 4% of the general population. However, they comprise more than 42% of the prisoners in custody. Indigenous courts are one method in which the Western Australian government is attempting to remedy this imbalance. The involvement of indigenous Australians in the criminal court system has been trialled a number of times in Western Australia. The earliest is perhaps in 1930 when the State government established the Court of Native Affairs. This court dealt exclusively with criminal offences between Australian Aboriginal people against other Australian Aboriginal people. The court ceased to operate in 1954 and was criticised for removing important legal rights for Aboriginal defendants. Defendants were dealt with under tribal law rather than the <b>general</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>law,</b> and probably received sentences more severe than if dealt with under the general law. [...] Another area of indigenous involvement was in the 1970s in the Kimberley region where magistrates informally invited Aboriginal Elders to sit with them when dealing with aboriginal offenders. More recently, magistrates have informally held what was called the “Wiluna Aboriginal Court” in 2001 and also the “Yandeyarra Circle Court” in 2003. [...] The establishment of the current Aboriginal Community Court is a recognition of the benefits of “circle sentencing”. These were local initiatives by presiding stipendiary magistrates and did not reflect a whole of government approach.|$|E

40|$|The Convention for the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (2007) {{laid down}} the {{criminal}} law standards {{for the protection of}} minors. After the ratification of this Convention, these standards became part of the Serbian legal system but Serbia assumed an obligation to provide for their further elaboration and implementation. The obligation was put into effect by amending the Criminal Code (2009) and adopting the Act on Special Measures for the Prevention of Sex Crimes against Minors (2013). In that context, this paper is an attempt to critically examine the implementation of these standards in the field of <b>general</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>law,</b> the scope of criminal offences introduced to protect the sexual integrity of minors, the special measures for their protection and the special registers on the perpetrators of criminal offences involving sexual abuse against minors.

40|$|Where {{death is}} caused through {{culpable}} carelessness, {{such as in}} a road accident, the legal response in many situations is a finding of manslaughter. But until recently the legal system has tended not to resort to this option in cases of death occurring in the workplace. In particular, given the prevalence of the corporate structure among employers, individual company officers have often been able {{to rely on the}} 'corporate shield' to avoid being called to account in this way. More recently there have been many calls for company officers to be judged for serious neglect of their duties, leading to the death of workers, {{in the same way that}} they would be judged if they were carelessly in control of a motor vehicle and caused the death of another driver. Prosecution authorities, in particular in the United Kingdom, have started to make more use of the <b>general</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> of manslaughter, rather than simply relying on the specific workplace safety statutes. Arguably there are benefits to this flowing from the community perception that a manslaughter charge is a much more serious business than a 'mere' workplace safety prosecution. This article aims to consider how under the criminal law a company officer might be found to be guilty of either manslaughter or another serious offence as a result of the death of a worker employed by the company...|$|E
40|$|This study {{addresses}} the classic {{question of the}} tension between military discipline and individual responsibility; and whether {{and to what extent}} following superior orders may constitute a circumstance excluding criminal liability. Unlawful acts performed pursuant to superior orders can be regarded as a question of necessity – “I was forced to act” – or as a question of mistake of law – “I did not know it was wrong”. Unlike in international criminal law, in Norwegian law necessity can justify an otherwise criminal act but not all actions are justifiable: for example, sacrificing innocent lives to save another life will never be a lawful act of necessity. This may in the author’s view lead to the unreasonably strict enforcement of the law and a soldier could thus be found guilty of manslaughter for failing to be a hero in an impossible situation. Though mitigation of sentence is granted, the label of guilt remains. There is no criminal responsibility without subjective guilt, but to plead ignorance of the law – “mistake of law” – has in Norwegian <b>general</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> very rarely led to the exclusion of criminal liability. In the Norwegian military criminal code, however, the subordinate is relieved of criminal responsibility for acts performed in compliance with an order unless the subordinate knew or should have known that the order was unlawful. It is the author’s view that soldiers and officers who comply with superior orders are thus treated more leniently than people in general. Furthermore, this may imply the – much contested – possibility of being acquitted for certain war crimes when these are not manifestly unlawful. One example is when a soldier mistakenly considers certain civilian conduct to be direct participation in hostilities, which would temporarily make the civilian a lawful target. This mistake would result in a direct attack on protected persons – a war crime...|$|E
40|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} advantage available to a prosecutor in a criminal conspiracy case is {{the exception to the}} hearsay rule for co-conspirator declarations. The exception is widely used and is often {{a significant part of the}} government presentation. In essence, it provides that otherwise inadmissible hearsay declarations of coconspirators are admissible at trial against the defendant so long as they were made during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy. The exception typically arises when an alleged co-conspirator declarant tells the witness (often an undercover police officer) all about the conspiracy, perhaps in the hope of attracting a buyer or a seller of drugs. During the conversation the defendant is identified as a member of the group. The witness then is called to testify at trial about this conversation. Numerous judges and commentators have explored why the exception is so important in a case like this. Basically it is because the declarant is often not available for cross-examination, and the witness is now specifically naming this defendant as having participated in the conspiracy. During the last several years, major changes have taken place which have affected the exception itself, its general application, and proof problems in connection with specific types of conspiracies. While some of these issues have been addressed previously, they have been viewed primarily from the vantage point of persons with expertise in the area of evidence law. Rarely, however, have these problems been analyzed in terms of <b>general</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> issues such as the quantum of proof required at trial or the procedures to be employed at a conspiracy trial. This article will focus attention on five major aspects of the coconspirator exception shaped considerably by recent events: the structure of the exception, the three elements of the exception, trial procedures utilized in connection with it, confrontation clause challenges to it, and the scope of the conspiracy. Numerous other problems are related to the hearsay exception and indeed can be vital to the trial and appellate practice in conspiracy cases. Nevertheless, such problems have been omitted here either because there have been few recent developments of significance, or because the relation is not close...|$|E
