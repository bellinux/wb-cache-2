5|$|Keswick {{is in the}} lee of the Skiddaw group, {{the oldest}} group of rocks in the Lake District. These fells were formed during the Ordovician period, 488 to 443 million years ago; they <b>form</b> <b>a</b> <b>triangle</b> {{sheltering}} the town, reaching a maximum height of 931m on Skiddaw itself. To the west of Portinscale, to the south-west of the village of Thornthwaite, is Whinlatter Forest Park and Grisedale Pike. To the east, beyond Castlerigg stone circle, is St John's in the Vale, {{at the foot of the}} Helvellyn range, which is popular with ramblers starting from Keswick. In 2010, Electricity North West, United Utilities, the Lake District National Park Authority and the conservation charity Friends of the Lake District invested £100,000 to remove power lines and replace them with underground cables, to improve the quality of scenery in the vicinity.|$|E

Geometrically stated, there are no three points within the gamut that <b>form</b> <b>a</b> <b>triangle</b> that {{includes}} the entire gamut; or more simply, the gamut of human vision is not a triangle.|$|E

25|$|A distance-hereditary graph is bipartite if {{and only}} if it is triangle-free. Bipartite distance-hereditary graphs can be built up from a single vertex by adding only pendant {{vertices}} and false twins, since any true twin would <b>form</b> <b>a</b> <b>triangle,</b> but the pendant vertex and false twin operations preserve bipartiteness. Every bipartite distance-hereditary graph is chordal bipartite and modular.|$|E
25|$|There are 28 ways of {{selecting}} a point {{and a line}} that are not incident to each other (an anti-flag), and six ways of permuting the Fano plane while keeping an anti-flag fixed. For every non-incident point-line pair (p,l), the three points that are unequal to p and that {{do not belong to}} l <b>form</b> <b>a</b> <b>triangle,</b> and for every triangle there is a unique way of grouping the remaining four points into an anti-flag.|$|E
25|$|Triangular {{movement}}: This is {{a movement}} tactic that allows a safe and quick shifting of the offensive flanks while maintaining control of the ball. In a triangular play the ball is passed between three players to <b>form</b> <b>a</b> <b>triangle.</b> The triangle is then shifted to a different position when a new player is added. Many triangles can be created with various combinations of players {{with the intention of}} slowly moving the ball forward and never really compromising possession. This tactic works well when trying to gain control in the midfield. However, it can also be used for pure attacking purposes. The effectiveness of this tactic {{lies in the fact that}} defenders are unable to quickly 'adapt' to the other attacker's style of play.|$|E

25|$|Like {{others before}} and after him, he also noticed that the Moon has a {{noticeable}} parallax, i.e., that it appears displaced from its calculated position (compared to the Sun or stars), and the difference is greater when closer to the horizon. He knew that this is because in the then-current models the Moon circles {{the center of the}} Earth, but the observer is at the surface—the Moon, Earth and observer <b>form</b> <b>a</b> <b>triangle</b> with a sharp angle that changes all the time. From the size of this parallax, the distance of the Moon as measured in Earth radii can be determined. For the Sun however, there was no observable parallax (we now know that it is about 8.8", several times smaller than the resolution of the unaided eye).|$|E
25|$|Various {{symbolic}} and religious qualities {{are attributed to}} Hasidic dress, though they are mainly apocryphal and the clothes' origin is cultural and historical. For example, the long overcoats are considered modest, the Shtreimel is supposedly related to shaatnez and keeps one warm without using wool, and Sabbath shoes are laceless {{in order not to}} have to tie a knot, a prohibited action. A gartel divides the Hasid's lower parts from his upper parts, implying modesty and chastity, and for kabbalistic reasons, Hasidim button their clothes right over left. Hasidim customarily wear black hats during the weekdays, as do nearly all Haredim today. A variety of hats are worn depending on the group: Chabad often pinch their hats to <b>form</b> <b>a</b> <b>triangle</b> on the top, Satmar wear an open-crown hat with rounded edges, and Samet (velvet) or biber (beaver) hats are worn by many Galician and Hungarian Hasidim.|$|E
500|$|There {{are several}} pieces by Stoddart in Glasgow's Merchant City quarter. Italia, a 2.6 metre, glass re-in-forced polymer statue {{on top of}} Ingram Street {{represents}} the contribution of Italian traders to the area. Classical in style, the female form is swathed in a chiton and carries symbols of ancient Italy: a palm branch {{in her right hand}} and an inverted cornucopia in her left. On John Street, a trio of figures, Mercury, Mercurius and Mercurial <b>form</b> <b>a</b> <b>triangle.</b> The first two, identical figures, sit above the John St. façade of the Italian centre; their English and Roman names signify the two different manifestations of the deity in Roman mythology. Here, they embody a [...] "dialogue" [...] between ancient lore and modern city life. Opposite, on a plinth on the street, stands Mercurial, cast in bronze and with the adjectival form of the name, it complements the duality of the other two with an underlying unity.|$|E
50|$|If {{a player}} {{occupies}} three adjacent vertices <b>forming</b> <b>a</b> <b>triangle,</b> he {{is entitled to}} relocate one enemy token. This is called <b>forming</b> <b>a</b> mill. If a player occupies a square (called a double mill), he may relocate two enemy tokens. <b>Forming</b> <b>a</b> <b>triangle</b> and <b>a</b> square simultaneously only allows two relocations, not three. A player may immediately move a token out a mill and reform the mill the following turn. Indeed, {{this is a very}} common and allows a player to consistently <b>form</b> <b>a</b> mill every other turn.|$|R

500|$|Diamond and Pearl {{are set in}} {{the fictional}} region of Sinnoh, an island based on the Japanese island of Hokkaidō. Sinnoh is {{probably}} not directly connected to any other region in the Pokémon universe, much like Hoenn. It is characterized by large, snow-covered mountains (Mt. Coronet, {{a part of a}} mountain range, divides Sinnoh in half). In this game, the starters are the grass-type Turtwig, the fire-type Chimchar, and the water-type Piplup. Turtwig can evolve into Grotle and then into Torterra, Chimchar can evolve into Monferno and then into Infernape, and Piplup can evolve into Prinplup and then into Empoleon. Unlike other regions, Sinnoh has a [...] "northern" [...] feel to it because it is the only region with snow-covered routes. Sinnoh is also characterized by its waterways; it has three main lakes (Verity, Acuity, and Valor) that <b>form</b> <b>a</b> <b>triangle.</b> Unlike the Hoenn region, however, which is mostly water routes, only 30 percent of Sinnoh's landscape comprises waterways. Underneath Sinnoh's surface is the Sinnoh Underground, which is a large maze of caves and tunnels.|$|E

2500|$|The Reed {{water tube}} boiler was {{developed}} and patented in 1893 by J.W. Reed, manager of the engine works at Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company, which manufactured it. It was similar to its antecedent the duTemple boiler, and other developments from it such as the Normand and Yarrow boilers, in that each featured three cylindrical water chambers arranged to <b>form</b> <b>a</b> <b>triangle</b> or, viewed from one end, an inverted [...] "V" [...] shape: the top chamber collected steam, and was connected by two banks of steam-generating tubes to the two lower chambers, between which was a furnace.|$|E

In the 1950s, much of Old Town was an enclave to many of the first Puerto Ricans to emigrate to Chicago. They referred to this area as part of [...] "La Clark".|$|E
