[...] "I think cancelling just empowers extremists. I think {{for those of us who}} are trying to navigate a way out of this political problem, having the race allows us to build bridges across communities, and get people working together.

You Britainhad these problems last year in your country and there is a very big different between protesting for political rights and rioting, and the attack that happened around Force India was aimed at the police. It was unprovoked, and it was quite dangerous. But at no time was anyone from F1 in danger."I hope by coming here you understand that unlike what has been reported we are not trying to say we are perfect.

40|$|The {{equity risk}} premium (ERP) is an {{essential}} building block of {{the market value of}} risk. In theory, the collective action of all investors results in an equilibrium expectation for the return on the market portfolio excess of the risk-free return, the ERP. The ability of the valuation actuary to choose a sensible value for the ERP, whether as a required input to capital asset pricing model valuation, or any of its descendants, is as important as choosing risk-free rates and risk relatives (betas) to the ERP for the asset at hand. The historical realized ERP for the stock market appears to be at odds with pricing theory parameters for risk aversion. Since 1985, there has been a constant stream of research, each of which reviews theories of estimating market returns, examines historical data periods, or both. Those ERP value estimates vary widely from about 1 % to about 9 %, based on a geometric or arithmetic averaging, short or long horizons, short- or long-run expectations, unconditional or conditional distributions, domestic or international data, data periods, and real or nominal returns.

Sure, she's terrified of germs and in love with a married man, so seeing her as the voice of reason for the kids is amazing." [...] Emma's relationship with Will will continue to grow, as [...] "she has these moments of clarity when she's talking to Will because he calms her." [...] Mays described her in an interview with TheTVChick: [...] "She is a romantic at heart. But she’s practical. She’s very interesting, because she does have those dreams and hopes of finding the right man. And in her mind, even though Will Schuester’s married, that sort of guy is like the perfect guy for her. She’s very practical in the fact that she doesn’t want to be alone and she knows that she’s somewhat limited in a small town to men. And Ken Tanaka is a very nice man, he’s not exactly like Will, but he’s good to her and he’s solid. He’s got a job, and he understands her and he understands all her quirks and stuff. So she’s practical, she knows that just might be her lot in life. So it’s weird. She’s got this very dreamy side about her and who she wants to be and what she wants her life to be like. But she’s also got this very practical, down-to-earth, well this is kind of the best I can do thing. It’s funny {{a lot of people have}} thought that part about her is weak.

5000|$|Thus, {{actually}} two conflicting metaphors are being used: The well-known metaphor of information as a quantity, like {{water in the}} waterpipe, is at work, but so is a second metaphor, that of information as a choice, a choice made by :an information provider, and a forced choice made by an :information receiver. Actually, the second metaphor implies that the information sent isn’t necessarily equal to the information received, because any choice implies a comparison {{with a list of}} possibilities, i.e., a list of possible meanings. Here, meaning is involved, thus spoiling the idea of information as a pure [...] "Ding an sich." [...] Thus, much of the confusion regarding the concept of information seems {{to be related to the}} basic confusion of metaphors in Shannon’s theory: is information an autonomous quantity, or is information always per se information to an observer? <b>Actually,</b> <b>I</b> don’t <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Shannon himself chose one of the two definitions. Logically speaking, his theory implied information as a subjective phenomenon. But this had so wide-ranging epistemological impacts that Shannon didn’t seem to fully realize this logical fact. Consequently, he continued to use metaphors about information as if it were an objective substance. This is the basic, inherent contradiction in Shannon’s information theory."

He’s never shown to me in any of our scenes that he was particularly uncomfortable or anything. He’s a fantastic actor." [...] Sutton elaborated, [...] "I know he has made a comment before in the press about feeling uncomfortable with the kissing and the physical side of it, but I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> just goes down to — Guy’s very, very proud of his heterosexual masculinity, if you will. … He was a bit more uncomfortable than perhaps I’d prefer but very, very quick-thinking and he was always very professional." ...|$|R
