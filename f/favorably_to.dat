In contrast to Hallidayboro's bustling, peaceful environment, coal miners never lived in the attractive houses provided by Joseph Leiter.|$|E
5|$|Music critics reacted <b>favorably</b> <b>to</b> the album, who cited its bombastic {{approach}} and musical composition as highlights. Critics {{also felt that}} the album effectively reflected the dance culture in Miami. Club Life: Volume Two Miami performed successfully in several countries including Canada, Russia, Switzerland and the United States, where it peaked at number sixteen on the Billboard 200.|$|E
5|$|P.N.03 was {{developed}} {{on a tight}} schedule {{in an attempt to}} offset Capcom's poor fiscal year. However, the game received mixed reviews and failed commercially. Several critics found the game repetitive and unintuitive. They were divided on its gameplay mechanics: some disliked its controls—specifically the inability to move and shoot simultaneously—while others compared it <b>favorably</b> <b>to</b> golden age arcade games. Mikami repurposed ideas from P.N.03 in his 2010 game Vanquish.|$|E

5|$|Some critics, however, responded <b>favorably</b> <b>to</b> Eureka. French writer Paul Valéry praised it {{for both}} its poetic and {{scientific}} merit, calling it an abstract poem based on mathematical foundations. Albert Einstein {{in a letter}} written in 1934, noted that Eureka was eine schöne Leistung eines ungewöhnlich selbständigen Geistes (a beautiful achievement of an unusually independent mind).|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the film's première, it was made freely {{available}} from the iTunes Store for one month, during which time it was downloaded more than 500,000 times.

5|$|The game {{received}} wide critical acclaim, {{being compared}} <b>favorably</b> <b>to</b> Civilization II. Critics praised its science fiction storyline (comparing the plot to works by Stanley Kubrick, Frank Herbert, Arthur C. Clarke, and Isaac Asimov), the in-game writing, the voice acting, the user-created custom units, {{and the depth}} of the technology tree.

5|$|The show's {{first season}} in 2010 rated strongly, and was {{compared}} <b>favorably</b> <b>to</b> The Footy Show by critics. It had been criticised for lacking serious football analysis, but {{had also been}} praised for its typically Australian character-based sketches. The Controversy Corner segment of the show was briefly spun off as a standalone Sunday morning program during the 2010 NRL finals.|$|E
5|$|A study {{conducted}} by a United States child psychiatrist, Dr Kyle D. Pruett, found that infants between 7 and 30 months responded more <b>favorably</b> <b>to</b> being picked up by their fathers. Pruett also found that a father's parenting style is beneficial for a child's physical, cognitive, emotional and behavioral development. Mothers reassure toddlers when they become frustrated while fathers encourage them to manage their frustration. This helps the children {{learn to deal with}} stress and frustration. A long-term study Pruett conducted proved that a father's active involvement with his children, from birth to adolescence, promotes greater emotional balance, stronger curiosity and a stronger sense of self-assurance in the child.|$|E
5|$|Larry's {{interactions}} with key women {{are accompanied by}} a detailed image of whomever he is speaking with, unlike other non-player characters. With {{the exception of the}} prostitute, each of the women shun Larry at first, but respond <b>favorably</b> <b>to</b> gifts of varying sorts. Although {{it is not possible to}} woo all of the women, giving gifts is needed to advance to the game's final area, the hotel penthouse. To this end, money is essential to advance through the game. The only available method of augmenting Larry's funds is to gamble in the casino, playing blackjack and slots.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{breakout}} {{stars of}} the show was Freddie Earlle, whose character Corporal Pasquale was <b>favorably</b> compared <b>to</b> Sgt. Bilko. The series also featured Stuart Damon of The Champions, who also wrote one episode.|$|R

5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1862, word began to spread through the Army of Tennessee that Generals Bragg and Edmund Kirby Smith were {{planning}} an invasion of Kentucky. The legislative council voted to endorse the invasion plan, and on August 27, Governor Hawes was dispatched <b>to</b> Richmond <b>to</b> <b>favorably</b> recommend it <b>to</b> President Davis. Davis was non-committal, but Bragg and Smith proceeded, nonetheless.|$|R
5|$|Popular {{response}} {{was much less}} effusive. The show averaged 9 million viewers per episode, as compared to The Cosby Show, which garnered an average 63 million viewers per week. Our World was the lowest rated prime time show of the 104 that aired during the 1986-7 television season, bringing in only a 6.5/10 rating/share. One segment of the public who responded very <b>favorably</b> <b>to</b> the program was teachers, who assigned Our World as homework. ABC created a study guide for the show, mailing out some 39,000 copies a month to educators and fans.|$|E
5|$|The Jain writer Adikavi Pampa, widely {{regarded}} as one of the most influential Kannada writers, became famous for Adipurana (941). Written in champu (mixed prose-verse style) style, it is the life history of the first Jain tirthankara Rishabhadeva. Pampa's other notable work was Vikramarjuna Vijaya (941), the author's version of the Hindu epic, Mahabharata, with Arjuna as the hero. Also called Pampa Bharata, it is a eulogy of the writer's patron, King Chalukya Arikeseri of Vemulawada (a Rashtrakuta feudatory), comparing the king's virtues <b>favorably</b> <b>to</b> those of Arjuna. Pampa demonstrates such a command of classical Kannada that scholars over the centuries have written many interpretations of his work.|$|E
5|$|The manga {{has become}} one of Shueisha's bestsellers, with over 22.5 million copies sold. In Japan and North America, several {{individual}} volumes have appeared in weekly top-ten lists of bestselling manga. Although most reviewers found it similar to other series for the same demographic, they compared its moments of originality and well-developed characters <b>favorably</b> <b>to</b> other shōnen series. Hoshino's artwork has received mixed reviews; critics commented that her characters are visually appealing, but her fight sequences are difficult to follow.|$|E
50|$|Gallagher enjoyed early success, both {{financially and}} in popular response, {{and through the}} 1920s and 1930s he {{occupied}} a prominent position in the American art world, being <b>favorably</b> compared <b>to</b> artists like Woodbury, Benson, and even Winslow Homer (1836-1910).|$|R

5000|$|The Song of Songs 1:3 {{contains}} a poetic chant of praise to a man, declaring {{that all the}} alamot adore him. In verse 6:8 a girl is <b>favorably</b> compared <b>to</b> 60 Queens (wives of the King), 80 Concubines, and numberless alamot.|$|R
5|$|Upon {{the revelation}} of the character's new design as a cyborg ninja, writers noted how Raiden distanced himself from his {{previous}} appearance that imitated Solid Snake. They also emphasized how Raiden becomes {{a different type of}} game hero with a new, direct fighting style. Since Raiden has become more powerful than Solid Snake in physical strength and weaponry to the point of exaggeration, writers have compared him <b>favorably</b> <b>to</b> other popular game heroes and find his actions still in-character considering the fight scenes throughout the series.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, recent studies show an {{increasingly}} positive attitude {{of patients and}} physicians (M.D. and D.O.) towards the use of manual therapy as a valid, safe and effective treatment modality. One survey, published in the Journal of Continuing Medical Education, found {{that a majority of}} physicians (81%) and patients (76%) felt that manual manipulation (MM) was safe, and over half (56% of physicians and 59% of patients) felt that manipulation should be available in the primary care setting. Although less than half (40%) of the physicians reported any educational exposure to MM and less than one-quarter (20%) have administered MM in their practice, most (71%) respondents endorsed desiring more instruction in MM. Another small study examined the interest and ability of M.D. residents in learning osteopathic principles and skills, including OMT. It showed that after a 1-month elective rotation, the M.D. residents responded <b>favorably</b> <b>to</b> the experience.|$|E
5|$|Governor Desha's {{reputation}} was further tarnished {{because of a}} pardon issued to his son. On November 2, 1824, Isaac B. Desha had brutally murdered Francis Baker, a Mississippian who was visiting Kentucky. On November 24, 1824, John Rowan, one of the governor's allies in the General Assembly, introduced legislation ordering the Fleming County Circuit Court to convene a special session on January 17, 1825, for Isaac Desha's trial and providing that the accused should {{have the option to}} request a change of venue to Harrison County at that time. Miles from the scene of the murder, Harrison County was the governor's home county, and he possessed a great deal of influence with officials there. Governor Desha appeared before the legislative committee considering the bill on November 26 and asked that they report it <b>favorably</b> <b>to</b> the full legislature. This was done, and the bill was approved on December 4, 1824.|$|E
30|$|A clear {{limitation}} of the TI process is that, during maturation, current performance is not directly indicative of future potential. In fact, no standard physical assessment provides insight into how an individual is likely to respond to future training. In this article, we explore {{the possibility that the}} utilization of genetic markers associated with the capacity <b>to</b> <b>favorably</b> respond <b>to</b> imposed training stress may provide valuable, and currently missing, insights relating to future trainability, rather than current ability, thus providing clues as to whether the athlete has the innate “talent” to respond to training.|$|R
30|$|This study {{explores the}} effect of age and chronic {{conditions}} on public perceptions of the health system, {{as measured by the}} Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of healthcare, in the province of Alberta in Canada. Drawing from data collected by Government of Alberta’s Department of Health and Wellness, this research examines two key questions: (1) Do people in the 65 + age group rate the KPIs of healthcare (i.e., availability, accessibility, quality, outcome, and satisfaction) more <b>favorably</b> compared <b>to</b> people in younger age groups in Alberta? (2) Does the rating of KPIs of healthcare in Alberta vary with different chronic conditions (i.e., no chronic problem, chronic illnesses without pain, and chronic pain)? The findings indicate that people in the older age group tend to rate the KPIs of healthcare more <b>favorably</b> compared <b>to</b> younger age groups in Alberta, net of socio-demographic factors, self-reported health status, and knowledge and utilization of health services. However, people experiencing chronic pain are less likely to rate the KPIs of healthcare <b>favorably</b> compared <b>to</b> people with no chronic health problem in Alberta. Discussion includes implications of the findings for the healthcare system in the province.|$|R
