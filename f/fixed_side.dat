25|$|In 1957, the KR200 Kabrio {{model was}} released, {{featuring}} a cloth convertible top and <b>fixed</b> <b>side</b> window frames. This {{was followed by}} the KR201 Roadster without window frames, using a folding cloth top, a windscreen, and removable side curtains. A Sport Roadster was later offered with no top and with the canopy fixed into place so that the driver would have to climb in and out {{at the top of the}} car.|$|E
25|$|The D.8 was a {{tailless}} four bay unstaggered biplane {{with its}} wings swept at 32°. Its constant chord wings were built up around two spruce spars, the forward one forming the leading edge. To help achieve stability the incidence and interplane gap decreased outboard, the former becoming negative. This washout on tips well behind {{the centre of}} gravity provided longitudinal stability {{in the same way}} as a conventional tailplane, set at lower incidence than the wings. Camber increased outwards. Simple, near parallel, pairs of interplane struts joined the spars. The outer interplane struts were enclosed with fabric, forming <b>fixed</b> <b>side</b> curtains that provided directional (yaw) stability. Wing tip elevons were used for control, operated by a pair of levers, one either side of the pilot. The D.8 initially used just a pair of these, mounted on the upper wing, a rectangular cutout in the side curtains allowing for their movement as on the D.5. Large parts of the aircraft were built by Short Brothers.|$|E
2500|$|Stiles – Vertical {{boards that}} run the full {{height of a}} door and compose its right and left edges. The hinges are mounted to the <b>fixed</b> <b>side</b> (known as the [...] "hanging stile"), and the handle, lock, bolt or latch are mounted on the {{swinging}} side (known as the [...] "latch stile").|$|E
50|$|Wall battens like roofing battens {{are used}} to <b>fix</b> <b>siding</b> {{materials}} such as tile or shingles. Rainscreen construction uses battens (furring) {{as part of a}} system which allows walls to dry out more quickly than normal.|$|R
50|$|A flatbed {{has a solid}} bed, usually {{of wooden}} planks. There is no roof and no <b>fixed</b> <b>sides.</b> To retain the load there are often low sides which may be hinged down for loading, as a 'drop-side' truck. A 'stake truck' has no sides but has steel upright pillars, which may be removable, again used to retain the load.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} NodeTrix {{planarity}} testing problem for flat clustered graphs when the maximum size of each cluster is bounded by a constant k. We consider both {{the case when}} {{the sides of the}} matrices to which the edges are incident are fixed and the case when they can be arbitrarily chosen. We show that NodeTrix planarity testing with <b>fixed</b> <b>sides</b> can be solved in O(k^ 3 k+ 3 / 2 n^ 3) time for every flat clustered graph that can be reduced to a partial 2 -tree by collapsing its clusters into single vertices. In the general case, NodeTrix planarity testing with <b>fixed</b> <b>sides</b> can be solved in O(n^ 3) time for k = 2, but it is NP-complete for any k ≥ 3. NodeTrix planarity testing remains NP-complete also in the free side model when k > 4.

2500|$|The 1975 Chevrolet Nova was the most-changed Chevy car {{for that}} model year. [...] "Now it's beautiful," [...] said the {{brochure}} of Nova's all-new sheet metal, [...] "refined {{along the lines}} of elegant European sedans." [...] Chevrolet wisely maintained a visual kinship with the 1968–1974 design, and also retained Nova's efficiently sized 111-inch wheelbase. Front tread grew by an inch and a half, and the front stabilizer bar had a larger diameter. Novas now had standard front disc brakes and steel-belted radial tires. The front suspension and subframe assembly was similar to the one used in the second generation GM F-body cars (the Camaro and Pontiac Firebird), whereas the rear axle and suspension were carried over from the previous generation. Coupes, including the hatchback, had <b>fixed</b> <b>side</b> windows (or optional flip-out windows) and vertical vents on the B-pillar. All Novas now had cut-pile carpeting, formerly installed only in the Custom series. Speedometers had larger, easier-to-read graphics. Windshields offered greater glass area. Front-door armrests were redesigned with integral pull bars. The base model carried the inline Six-cylinder , , three V8 engines ( [...] , a 1975-only option, a [...] and a [...] ) for 1976 only, were offered. Mated to a three-speed automatic, 3-speed manual or 4-speed – V8s only – Which remained the norm {{through the end of the}} decade (and the end of the rear-wheel drive X platform).|$|E
6000|$|... 205. To obtain {{perfectly}} {{satisfactory results}} a new galvanometer was constructed, {{consisting of two}} independent coils, each containing eighteen feet of silked copper wire. These coils were exactly alike in shape and number of turns, and were <b>fixed</b> <b>side</b> by side with a small interval between them, in which a double needle could be hung by a fibre of silk exactly as in the former instrument (87.). The coils may be distinguished by the letters KL, and when electrical currents were sent through {{them in the same}} direction, acted upon the needle with the sum of their powers; when in opposite directions, with the difference of their powers.|$|E
60|$|It {{is curious}} to note how many little peculiarities of dress or {{manufacture}} are equally necessitated by this prime distinction {{of right and}} left. Here are a very few of them, which the reader can indefinitely increase for himself. (I leave out of consideration obvious cases like boots and gloves: to insult that proverbially intelligent person's intelligence with those were surely unpardonable.) A scarf habitually tied in a sailor's knot acquires one long side, left, and one short one, right, from {{the way it is}} manipulated by the right hand; if it were tied by the left, the relations would be reversed. The spiral of corkscrews and of ordinary screws turned by hand goes in accordance with the natural twist of the right hand: try to drive in an imaginary corkscrew with the right hand, the opposite way, and you will see how utterly awkward and clumsy is the motion. The strap of the flap that covers the keyhole in trunks and portmanteaus always has its <b>fixed</b> <b>side</b> over to the right, and its buckle to the left; in this way only can it be conveniently buckled by a right-handed person. The hands of watches and the numbers of dial-faced barometers run from left to right: this is a peculiarity dependent upon the left to right system of writing. A servant offers you dishes from the left side: you can't so readily help yourself from the right, unless left-handed. Schopenhauer despaired of the German race, because it could never be taught like the English to keep to {{the right side of the}} pavement in walking. A sword is worn at the left hip: a handkerchief is carried in the right pocket, if at the side; in the left, if in the coat-tails: in either case for the right hand to get at it most easily. A watch-pocket is made in the left breast; a pocket for railway tickets half-way down the right side. Try to reverse any one of these simple actions, and you will see at once that they are immediately implied in the very fact of our original right-handedness.|$|E
5000|$|The New Mini {{includes}} a blacked-out B-pillar and <b>fixed</b> rear <b>side</b> glass, {{although it is}} labeled 'Hardtop' in the United States.|$|R
50|$|These wagons have a {{level floor}} and solid sides {{with at least}} one door on each side. They are mainly used for {{transporting}} bulk goods, coal, scrap, steel, wood and paper. The majority of wagons have folding sides and end walls, otherwise they are given the letters l (<b>fixed</b> <b>sides)</b> or o (<b>fixed</b> end walls). Wagons may have one or two folding end walls. Steel rings enable ropes, nets or covers to be attached to secure the load.|$|R
50|$|Aside {{from the}} facelift, the biggest news was the {{addition}} of a Super DeLuxe version (which came equipped with a radio, a cigarette lighter, and white sidewall tires). Total weight for the base model truck crept up to 540 kg. The Snowler and Panel Van models continued to be available, making for a total of 28 various models. The range grew further in July 1970, when a pickup version with <b>fixed</b> <b>sides</b> and a rear gate (instead of the three-way fold down beds used so far) was added.|$|R
50|$|The car was now offered {{either as}} a two-door “cabrio-limousine” (a soft topped four seater with <b>fixed</b> <b>side</b> windows) or as a “full” two seater cabriolet.|$|E

5000|$|By October 1950 {{the further}} {{improved}} 4AB Roadster appeared. While superficially similar, this has an {{independent front suspension}} by coil springs and a hybrid, [...] "hydro-mechanical" [...] brake system by Girling. Externally, there is a shortened bonnet and disc wheels, as well as <b>fixed</b> <b>sides</b> to the bonnet. The fenders were also redesigned, becoming curvier and deeper. The steering box also received alterations, mainly aimed at centering it in the chassis so as to simplify manufacturing alternately right-hand or left-hand driven examples. The 4AB continued in production alongside the larger 4AD until January 1953.|$|R
40|$|The path of {{a running}} crack is studied by a total energy method. The Lagrange's {{equation}} of motion is used in which the crack tip position and its velocity are regarded as the generalized coordinate and velocity. The equation is solved to obtain the entire crack path {{in the case of}} Mode I crack in <b>fixed</b> <b>sided</b> plate. The result shows that in the low velocity range, the crack approaches to the center line of the plate, however, it moves away from the center as it approaches to the Rayleigh wave velocity. Related experiment was conducted...|$|R

5000|$|Usually, {{one side}} has a fixed type stepped threading, {{and the other}} side is {{threaded}} for a standard freewheel. Occasionally you may find double sided fixed hubs with stepped threading on both sides, but these are rare and only a few companies offer them. The <b>fixed</b> <b>side</b> has a stepped down diameter thread to accept a lockring. The larger diameter thread on the <b>fixed</b> <b>side</b> accepts a standard threaded cog, and uses the same size threads as the freewheel side of the hub. The most common standard I.S.O. thread size is 1.375" [...] x 24 tpi (threads per inch), but there are other less common older sizes (British 1.370" [...] x 24 tpi, French 34.7 x 1 mm, Italian 35 mm x 24 tpi).|$|E
50|$|Port {{connectors}} may be male or female, but female connectors {{are much}} more common. Bent pins are easier to replace on a cable than on a connector attached to a computer, so it was common to use female connectors for the <b>fixed</b> <b>side</b> of an interface.|$|E
50|$|For {{this model}} (called the KDP model), {{the most likely}} state (the least-energy state) has all {{horizontal}} arrows pointing in the same direction, and likewise for all vertical arrows. Such a state is a ferroelectric state, in which all hydrogen atoms have a preference for one <b>fixed</b> <b>side</b> of their bonds.|$|E

50|$|The present-day {{standard}} wagon for moisture-susceptible palletised goods has sliding sides rather than <b>fixed</b> <b>side</b> walls, which enables {{access to the}} entire loading area for loading and unloading. These wagons with sliding walls or sides did not evolve from the original covered wagon, but were derived in the 1950s from wagons with sliding roofs and sides, {{which is why they}} used to be grouped in Class K.|$|E
50|$|The {{conversion}} {{was enacted}} by Grizzly Engineering of Swan Hill during 1996. The modifications included {{the removal of}} the <b>fixed</b> <b>side</b> louvre panels and doors, the fitting of two internal bulkheads, 3 pairs of external bi-folding doors and repainting into V/Line Freight colours. VFBX 1 saw very little use, and by August 2000 the body had been removed and the underframe converted to flat-wagon VFTX 28.|$|E
30|$|We {{can assume}} that points A and A' are in {{the origins of the}} {{respective}} coordinate systems. One of the sides of the quadrilateral A'B'C'D' can be fixed without loss of generality. We will <b>fix</b> the <b>side</b> A'D' to be vertical.|$|R
50|$|Some older cribs {{contained}} a drop gate (or drop side), a side which lowers {{to ease the}} process of putting the child into the bed, but can be raised again to restore {{the integrity of the}} enclosure. However, assembly problems and malfunctioning hardware on drop gates can cause the formation of gaps, which have been attributed to infant deaths and other major injuries. In June 2011, the United States implemented new safety standards requiring all infant beds manufactured and sold in the country to have <b>fixed</b> <b>sides.</b> In June 2016, Canada implemented a similar ban on the sale, importation, or distribution of any infant bed containing drop sides effective December 29, 2016.|$|R
40|$|Heron triangles {{have the}} {{property}} {{that all three}} of their sides {{as well as their}} area are positive integers. In this paper, we give some estimates for the number of Heron triangles with two of their <b>sides</b> <b>fixed.</b> We provide a general bound on this count H (a,b), where the <b>sides</b> a,b are <b>fixed</b> positive integers, and the estimate here is better than the one of Ionescu, Luca and Stanica for the general situation of <b>fixed</b> <b>sides</b> a,b. In the case of primes sides p,q, there is an additional hypothesis which helps us to drop the upper bounds on H (p. q). In particular, we prove that H(p,q) is {{less than or equal to}} 1 when p - q = 2 (mod 4). We also provide a count for the number of Heron triangles with a fixed height (there exists only one such when the height is prime. Moreover, we study the decomposability property of a Heron triangle into two similar ones, and provide some cases when a Heron triangle is not decomposable...|$|R
50|$|The {{ground floor}} has {{a series of}} small windows which are located {{directly}} below the rendered section, whilst the first floor elevations incorporate large glazed sections. These take the form of louvres, double hung windows, and French doors, the latter two of which are divided into a series of uniform horizontal panes. All sets of French doors are flanked by <b>fixed</b> <b>side</b> panels, also with horizontal mullions and panes.|$|E

50|$|Only 296 {{examples}} of the S1 were manufactured (chassis numbers from 460001 to 460296). These are the rarest on the market. These cars had extremely light and minimalist construction, with <b>fixed</b> <b>side</b> windows, fixed seats (adjustable pedals needing the use of tools), no door handles, no internal door covers, and an aluminum dashboard. The steel chassis central beam was sandwiched (incorporated) within the fibreglass bodywork, thus reinforcing stiffness, but making repair rather complicated.|$|E
