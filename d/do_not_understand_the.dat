5|$|In another story, {{based on}} an old folktale-motif, and echoing a similar theme, Demeter was searching for her daughter, Persephone, having taken {{the form of an}} old woman called Doso, and {{received}} a hospitable welcome from Celeus, the King of Eleusis in Attica. As a gift to Celeus, because of his hospitality, Demeter planned to make his son Demophon a god, but she was unable to complete the ritual because his mother Metanira walked in and saw her son in the fire and screamed in fright, which angered Demeter, who lamented that foolish mortals <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> concept and ritual.|$|E

5|$|In the Enchanted Forest, the Evil Queen mourns {{the death}} of her husband, Snow White's father, {{although}} she herself is responsible for his death. Snow (Goodwin) and the Queen seemingly comfort each other over the loss. The Queen consults her magic mirror (Esposito) to ask how she can kill Snow, who is beloved by the people but a threat to her bid for the throne. She says that the king's knights will not kill his daughter, and the mirror tells her that she needs a huntsman. As Graham saw in his flashbacks, the Huntsman (Dornan) and his brother wolf seem to enjoy living a peaceful life in the woods. The Huntsman kills only for himself to live, and has no compassion for humans, who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> wild. As the Huntsman and his wolf enter a tavern, the other patrons begin harassing him, prompting him to successfully defend himself. His performance is viewed in the magic mirror by the Queen, who is greatly impressed. She summons the Huntsman to offer him anything he wants on the condition that he brings her Snow's heart. He agrees to this deal, in return asking for the protection of all the wolves in the Enchanted Forest.|$|E
5|$|Peter Ackroyd {{believes}} {{that it is impossible}} to paraphrase the content of the poem; the poem is too abstract to describe the events and the action that make up the poem's narrative structure. However, the philosophical basis for the poem can be explained since the discourse on time is connected to the ideas within St. Augustine's Confessions. As such, there is an emphasis on the present moment as being the only time period that really matters, because the past cannot be changed and the future is unknown. The poem emphasizes that memory must be abandoned to understand the current world, and humans must realize that the universe is based on order. The poem also describes that although consciousness cannot be bound within time, humans cannot actually escape from time on their own. The scene beneath London is filled with the time-bound people who are similar to the spiritually empty populace of The Hollow Men; they are empty because they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> Logos or the order of the universe. The conclusion of the poem emphasizes that God is the only one that is truly able to exist out of time and have knowledge of all times and places, but humankind is still capable of redemption through belief in Him and His ability to save them from the bounds of the material universe.|$|E

500|$|Luther {{criticizes the}} {{doctrine}} of the treasury of merit on which {{the doctrine of}} indulgences is based in theses 56–66.

This treasure tends to be hated because it makes [...] "the first last", in the words of Matthew 19:30 and 20:16. Luther uses metaphor and wordplay to describe the treasures of the gospel as nets to catch wealthy people, whereas the treasures of indulgences are nets to catch the wealth of men.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the suit}} he filed was rejected, the case {{garnered}} international media attention. Responding {{to questions about}} Chen’s allegation, a senior official with the National Population and Family Planning Commission told the Washington Post {{that the practice of}} forced abortions and sterilizations was “definitely illegal,” and indicated that the complaints were being investigated. “If the Linyi complaints are true, or even partly true, it's because local officials <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> new demands of the Chinese leadership regarding family planning work,” said the official. In September 2005, [...] the Commission announced that several Linyi officials had been detained. But local authorities in Linyi retaliated against Chen, placing him under house arrest in September 2005 and embarking on a campaign to undermine his reputation; the Linyi officials portrayed him as working for [...] "foreign anti-China forces", pointing out that he had received foreign funding for his advocacy on behalf of the disabled.|$|E
500|$|One of the {{problems}} that the All-China Women's Federation has identified is that women in China <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> federation’s contributions, or its significance in the women’s movement. [...] The members of the ACWF identified two potential sources for the lack of understanding. The first is that the ACWF has many roles and branch organizations which may be obscuring the contribution it is making. The second is that it has lacked consistency in how it has represented women, especially during its early years. Another problem facing the ACWF is its relationship with the international women’s movement. [...] The relationship between the Marxist view of feminism and current international views on feminism are often viewed as contradictory. Marxism often labels feminist movements as bourgeois because it focuses on the betterment of only one segment of society instead of society as a whole, and states capitalism, not the patriarchy, is the creator of gender inequality. The ACWF struggles with how to engage both, sometimes denying to have borrowed anything from international feminism.|$|E

500|$|When the indaba {{ended on}} 26 October, the chiefs and headmen {{returned}} a unanimous decision {{to support the}} government's stand for independence under the 1961 constitution, attesting in their report that [...] "people who live far away <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> problems of our country". This verdict {{was rejected by the}} nationalist movement {{on the grounds that the}} chiefs received governmental salaries; the chiefs countered that the black MPs in parliamentary opposition also received such salaries, but still opposed the government. Malvern, who was becoming perturbed by the RF's actions, dismissed the indaba as a [...] "swindle", asserting that the chiefs no longer had any real power; the British simply ignored the whole exercise. On 27 October, Wilson released a firm statement regarding Britain's intended response to UDI, warning that Rhodesia's economic and political ties with Britain, the Commonwealth and most of the world would be immediately severed amid a campaign of sanctions if Smith's government went ahead with UDI. This was intended to discourage white Rhodesians from voting for independence in the referendum, for which the RF campaign slogan was [...] "Yes means Unity, not UDI". Wilson was pleased when Douglas-Home, his leading opponent in the House of Commons, praised the statement as [...] "rough but right". On 5 November 1964, Rhodesia's mostly white electorate voted [...] "yes" [...] to independence under the 1961 constitution by a margin of 89%, prompting Smith to declare that the British condition of acceptability to the people as a whole had been met.|$|E
