5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> that's why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E
5|$|Suter and Heisman turned away. 'Can {{you beat}} that?' Suter asked the Auburn coach. Heisman didn't say anything, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> {{he thought a}} great deal. He told me {{afterwards}} {{that he had never}} felt so sorry for a man on a football field as he had for Suter at that moment.|$|E
5|$|As to Captain Benbow, I {{know of no}} {{difference}} between him and me, nor have we had any. He has no small obligation to me, but being called {{in some of the}} foolish printed papers ‘the famous Captain Benbow’, I suppose has put him a little out of himself, and has made him play the fool, as <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> in some of his letters. I will not farther now particularize this business, but time will show I have not been in the wrong, unless being too kind to an ungrateful man.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> {{of course}} that it meant a visit to Madame Fontaine.|$|R
60|$|I {{shook my}} head, though <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> well enough what night he meant.|$|R
6000|$|... "So <b>I</b> <b>guessed.</b> <b>I</b> left my canoe over yonder, an' took to {{the shore}} partly to find somethin' {{in the way of}} meat, and partly to have a look around." ...|$|R
5|$|Mother and I agreed, when {{we talked}} about it, that Dad never meant his poem to apply to one {{particular}} tree, or to the trees of any special region. Just any trees or all trees that might be rained on or snowed on, {{and that would be}} suitable nesting places for robins. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> they'd have to have upward-reaching branches, too, for the line about 'lifting leafy arms to pray.' Rule out weeping willows.|$|E
5|$|The {{first time}} he cheated on me, I thought there was {{something}} wrong with me or the relationship, but when someone makes a habit of it, you know the problem lies with him. Yet I was foolish enough to give him a second chance because he begged and pleaded, despite the fact that everyone around me said he was still straying. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> I really wanted to believe in him. Then I actually caught him red-handed. It took me a while to get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back.|$|E
25|$|And again I say, {{these little}} things that one does - considerate, compassionate, courageous - <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> it's pretty hard {{to be able to}} realize the impact they have.|$|E
60|$|Now Jan {{stared at}} him perplexedly, but I smiled, for <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> what was to come.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> three times, {{and each}} guess was wrong. Mary decided on helping me by a hint.|$|R
60|$|Sir LUCIUS O faith! <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> you weren't come empty-handed--Well--let me {{see what}} the dear {{creature}} says.|$|R
25|$|SESSIONS: Well, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> I'm {{concerned}} about your recollection, really, because it's {{not that long}} ago. It was an important issue. And that's troubling to me, I've got to tell you.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>guess</b> {{though you}} could {{honestly}} say {{the relationship between}} Greg (Chappell) and myself, {{when he came back}} from World Series Cricket, {{and all of a sudden}} I was playing in Queensland with him, was difficult for a little while.|$|E
25|$|Yes, it was difficult. The chemo really {{knocked me}} down, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> they {{almost have to}} kill you before you can start in your recovery. Everything is great, {{wonderful}} right now. I’m in remission {{and there have been}} no reoccurrences since my surgery. I’m blessed. I’m surrounded by the people I love.|$|E
6000|$|The {{nurse was}} dumb. Grace called {{to mind the}} {{hesitation}} that she had shown when she had mentioned her name, and drew a new conclusion from it. [...] "Should <b>I</b> be <b>guessing</b> right," [...] she asked, eagerly, [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> you to be some great lady in disguise?" ...|$|R
60|$|But {{presently}} <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> {{the identity}} of the mighty creature as Elephas africanus, or, as the ancients commonly described it, African elephant.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> at {{once that}} by that thrust he sought to incline her more to the union he had in view for her.|$|R
25|$|There {{are quite}} a few players like me who did really well early in their careers, but didn't {{consolidate}} later on. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> it is like climbing the highest peak on your first climb - where do you go from there, where is the next peak? Players these days have a great support network around them to guide them through that sort of stuff.|$|E
25|$|It sort of is {{a little}} puzzle and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> it goes by - but they're all great things. 'I won't stop doing {{beautiful}} things and I won't do bad things.' It's very noble. I'm {{very proud of that}} song because it's very much like out of the world of Excalibur. To me, it's like Sir Lancelot or something - very noble and chivalrous. That's my favorite song on the record - it's very ambitious.|$|E
25|$|He wasn't a gregarious bloke, really. He was {{actually}} quite retiring, {{but he was}} always up for a bit of fun. He never seemed to take his cricket all that seriously, in that country way. Numbers didn't mean much to him. In a lot of respects he had that 'Hookesy' outlook. Why would you get eight not out in 10 overs? He couldn't understand, what's the use of that? His record suggests unfulfilled talent and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> that's what it was to a certain extent.|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR BRO,--Barstow {{wrote that}} if I wanted the place I could have it. I wrote him that <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>I</b> would take it, {{and asked him}} how long before I must come up there. I have not heard from him since.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> {{that she}} was {{speaking}} of the quaint, kindly little woman, whose ugly surname had been hitherto the only name known to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Should I {{be right}} or wrong, Mr. Armadale, if <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> {{that you were}} {{thinking}} of somebody?" [...] asked a voice, softly, behind him.|$|R
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>guess</b> I {{just wanted}} this album to {{be a lot}} about me and all the {{different}} styles of music that I like – not just one sort of style or genre. I really {{want to be able to}} tell real stories through my music, rather than talking about stuff that doesn’t really matter which is what a lot of people seem to end up doing these days. I don’t want it to be just glossy and disposable; I want my songs to deal with real issues.|$|E
25|$|Magnétophone are an {{electronic}} / art rock band originating from Birmingham UK, composed of Matt Saunders (born 1972) and John Hanson (born 1973). Since their inception {{in the mid-1990s}} they have released two albums, <b>I</b> <b>Guess</b> Sometimes I Need to Be Reminded of How Much You Love Me and The Man Who Ate the Man, plus numerous singles and EPs and are currently signed to the revered art-house record label 4AD. Magnétophone rose to international recognition out of a period of vibrant musical activity in the second city, which also spawned contemporaries Broadcast.|$|E
25|$|There's {{no way he}} didn't see her, {{since she}} was {{practically}} looking into the cabin. At one stage, he turned around toward the building. The bulldozer kept moving, and she slipped and fell off the plow. But the bulldozer kept moving, the shovel above her. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> it was about 10 or 15 meters that it dragged her {{and for some reason}} didn't stop. We shouted like crazy to the operator through loudspeakers that he should stop, but he just kept going and didn't lift the shovel. Then it stopped and backed up. We ran to Rachel. She was still breathing.|$|E
6000|$|... "I knew {{perfectly}} well that you had not intentionally deserted either Dian or Pellucidar. <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> {{that in some way}} Hooja the Sly One was {{at the bottom of the}} matter, and I determined to go to Amoz, where <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> that Dian might come to the protection of her brother, and do my utmost to convince her, and through her Dacor the Strong One, that we had all been victims of a treacherous plot to which you were no party.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, Puck! Puck! <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> {{you right}} from {{when you talked}} about the salt. How could you ever do it?' Una cried, {{swinging}} along delighted.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Well,’ said I, ‘I own {{myself an}} idiot. Well do they say, an old soldier, an old innocent! For <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> nothing of all this.’ ...|$|R
25|$|I don't {{know why}} {{people call me}} a jazz singer, though <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> people {{associate}} me with jazz because I was raised in it, from way back. I'm not putting jazz down, but I'm not a jazz singer...I've recorded all kinds of music, but (to them) I'm either a jazz singer or a blues singer. I can't sing a blues – just a right-out blues – but I can put the blues in whatever I sing. I might sing 'Send In the Clowns' and I might stick a little bluesy part in it, or any song. What I want to do, music-wise, is all kinds of music that I like, and I like all kinds of music.|$|E
25|$|The way {{our studio}} {{operated}} was {{that anything that}} comes in – there’s no value judgments made about the music. We just record it. Still, {{one of the things}} that <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> was cool about being a staff engineer is that I wouldn’t have sought out a band like that. I wasn’t philosophically into anything that they were doing, but they were all good musicians – you would have to be to stay together at the speeds they were playing at. So there was that aspect of it, and just the whole pushing the envelope thing. It sounds like it’s just gonna completely break apart going 700 miles through the sky and then all of a sudden everything just comes right together again.|$|E
25|$|It's {{tougher to}} {{be a young}} writer today than when I was a young writer. I don't think my first novel would have been {{published}} today as I submitted it. I don't think an editor would have read 50 pages of it. It was very overdone and shaggy, but two young editors saw something that seemed worth pursuing and eventually we all did some work on the book and it was published. I don't think publishers {{have that kind of}} tolerance these days, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> possibly as a result, more writers go to writing class now than then. I think first, fiction, and second, novels, are much more refined in terms of language, but they may tend to be too well behaved, almost in response to the narrower market.|$|E
60|$|Once {{more the}} ground was level. From the wind that blew about me <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> that <b>I</b> must be upon some exposed peak of ridge.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Pickett nodded. [...] "I {{opened it}} with my own key. I had been calling {{to him and he}} didn't answer, so <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> {{something}} was wrong." ...|$|R
6000|$|We {{sat down}} in the window-seat; I assured her I would not scold, {{whatever}} her secret might be, and <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> it, of course; so she commenced-- ...|$|R
