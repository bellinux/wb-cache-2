The model experiments were carried out on sea and at circular tank. The model was made with galvanized iron-plate (0. 48 mm in thickness), dimension of the model being 23. 4 cm in length, 21. 7 cm in width, and 225 g in weight, respectively.

40|$|The main {{objectives}} {{in this thesis}} {{was to investigate the}} effect of oblique <b>trawl</b> <b>board</b> crossings, increased <b>trawl</b> <b>board</b> added mass due to seabed proximity and the effect of a more rectangular <b>trawl</b> <b>board</b> geometry. In addition a new hydrodynamic load model which handles the seabed proximity and forward speed in a more consistent way was examined. All simulations in this thesis are performed by means of the computer software SIMLA. A brief description of methods applied in SIMLA and nonlinear finite element analysis is therefore included. The thesis contains also a chapter which describes trawling concepts and <b>trawl</b> <b>boards</b> used in Norwegian waters. Design loads from trawl gears on subsea pipelines are nowadays based on recommendations from the DNV-RPF 111 code. Simulation models with a 4500 kg polyvalent <b>trawl</b> <b>board</b> were established to verify the DNV recommendations for free spans of height 0 m and 1 m. The simulations demonstrated that increasing <b>trawl</b> <b>board</b> added mass due to seabed proximity did not have any influence on neither pull-over loading nor pipeline response. The effect of a rectangular <b>trawl</b> <b>board</b> geometry was most pronounced for a span height of 0 m because the duration increased by 0. 5 s and the horizontal pull-over force was kept constant throughout the pull-over. A slighty larger pull-over loading compared to the polyvalent board was observed for a span height of 1 m. Oblique <b>trawl</b> <b>board</b> crossings were examined for 6 different hit angles. The major finding was that a perpendicular crossing did not predict the largest pull-over load. On a general basis the simulations for a span height of 1 m underpredicted maximum pull-over force, duration and pipeline displacement compared to the DNV-RP-F 111 recommendations. The 0 m span height simulations indicate that DNV predicts a different shape of the load time history and is slightly nonconservative in terms of maximum pull-over load. The new hydrodynamic load model which includes the effect of forward speed and seabed proximity was used to simulate a perpendicular <b>trawl</b> <b>board</b> crossing. Here the span height of 0 m indicated that the DNV-RP-F 111 code is nonconservative in terms of the pull-over load. The simulation for a span height of 1 m was however in very good agreement with the DNV-RP-F 111 code in terms of duration and horizontal pull-over load. Therefore it is recommended that future simulations are based on the new hydrodynamic load model. </p...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, the weights of <b>trawl</b> <b>boards</b> {{used in the}} North Sea, Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea have {{increased}} significantly from barely a ton to a score of tons. In addition, the trawling speed has increased as well. These new faster and heavier <b>trawl</b> <b>boards,</b> in an event of impact with subsea structures, will result to tremendous loads on these structures. Impact with existing structures which were designed with recommendation from ISO 13628 - part 1 may be devastating for the subsea structures as the new loads the structures will experience may be greater than its design loads. Model trails performed in the late 80 ´s at a water depth of 100 m, speed at 1, 8 m/s and <b>trawl</b> <b>board</b> weight up to 1 900 kg resulted to an establishment of a design impact energy requirement of 13 kJ [9]. Statoil, {{in response to the}} increase in weight and velocity of <b>trawl</b> <b>boards,</b> raised their impact energy recommendation to 38 kJ. This thesis aims at raising concerns on the level of conservatism in these values given that impact incidence that resulted to no damage at all on a subsea structure have been reported. It is worth mentioning that these structures were designed according to ISO 13628 - part 1, but however the <b>trawl</b> <b>board</b> in this impact had a weight of 4 400 kg. Statoil´s recommendation springs from impact test conducted in air and a theoretical study of the trawling situation for subsea structures from DNV report. The following question arises: Is the Statoil´s recommended design impact energy of 38 kJ too conservative? The goal of this work is to challenge this impact energy recommendation. This will be done by conducting a series of impact test on a copper pipe under the following configurations: - An empty pipe will be impact tested in air. - A closed pipe filled with water will be impact tested in air. - A sealed water fill pipe will be impact tested in water. The result from the following configurations will be analyzed and compared {{in order to determine the}} possible effect of damping (due to water in and out of the structure) on its response, laying ground work for a full scale test...|$|R

A special case called hooking, defined as the situation when the trawl gear gets “stuck ” under the pipeline, should be a rarely occurring situation.

40|$|Subsea {{pipelines}} {{are likely}} to be exposed to fishing activity, which may results in trawl gear interacting with a pipeline. The interaction is classified into impact, pull-over and a special case called hooking. The trawl load is considered to be an important design load in pipeline design. In the recent developments of the subsea pipelines, the pipe-in-pipe (PIP) system is a solution for high-pressure/high-temperature requirements. Previous research and findings mainly focus on trawl gear interaction with a single pipe wall pipeline. There is limited research on trawl gear-PIP interaction. The main objective of this thesis work is to simulate and investigate the impact and pull-over responses of a pipe-in-pipe system during the interference with an otter <b>trawl</b> <b>board.</b> The numerical study were carried out based on nonlinear finite element (FE) method by means of the computer software SIMLA. Based on the previous models for the single pipe wall pipe, modifications on the models were made to account for PIP. An advanced impact model was enabled to study the impact response of PIP. Later, a detailed clump weight pullover model was modified and studied by using the new contact element (cont 153) in SIMLA. Finally, a detailed <b>trawl</b> <b>board</b> pull-over model (with simplified geometry) was modified with the cont 153 element to study the PIP response under pull-over loads. More details are described as follows. Firstly, a study was carried out to investigate the impact response of a single pipe wall pipe and a PIP system. The impact model was established according to the Recommended Practice DNV-RP-F 111 (RP) by using an advanced impact calculation method. Various pipeline parameters like pipe wall thickness, content density, concrete coating, specified minimum yield strength (SMYS), different trawl gears, and position of centralisers for PIP were considered. The purpose is to check how these parameters influence the impact response. For pull-over analysis, to gain more understanding of the cont 153 element, the clump weight model from Maalø’s work was tested. As a result of this study, a contact stiffness with good contact behaviour was obtained and then used in further study. It is also found that the ii friction coefficient has important influence on the results. The new contact element was then used in a <b>trawl</b> <b>board</b> model with the stiffness defined in the clump weight case. The warp line tension results are compared with previous model test results. The comparisons show that for lower span heights (0. 5 m and 1. 0 m), good agreements were achieved, but noticeable deviations were found for higher span heights (5. 0 m). Finally, the detailed <b>trawl</b> <b>board</b> model was used to investigate the pull-over responses (displacement, bending moment, strain, etc.) of a PIP at low span height (up to 1. 0 m). The pull-over responses from the detailed model were compared with those from RP load. The main finding is that the responses increases as the span height increases, and the responses from the detailed model are in general lower than the RP case. This finding indicates the possibility to further optimise PIP design in the view point of <b>trawl</b> <b>board</b> pull-over loads at low span heights...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this work is to {{formulate}} and apply new computational strategies for two contact-governed problems where existing finite element software suffer from poor efficiency and lack of robustness. The first problem is concerned with <b>trawl</b> <b>board</b> pull-over interaction of subsea pipelines while the second deals with reeling analysis of history-dependent flexible pipes. Previous numerical models for trawl-pipe interaction based on simplified geometry modeling has struggled with contact-related convergence problems. A contact element with a continuous description of the <b>trawl</b> <b>board</b> contact geometry and the pipe geometry was therefore developed. The assumption of a rigid contact geometry for the <b>trawl</b> <b>board</b> {{and the use of}} line-line and line-point contact kinematics resulted in good numerical efficiency properties. The ability to predict the pull-over responses depends heavily on the modeling of the <b>trawl</b> <b>board</b> hydrodynamic loads. A fairly advanced six degree of freedom load model with precomputed hydrodynamic coefficients was therefore established. An extensive simulation work was carried out to validate the trawl-pipe computational strategy and to identify sensitive model parameters. Regarding the former, the proposed numerical model was demonstrated to predict pull-over load impulses within a 10 % margin of model test measurements and was thus concluded to be capable of describing the relevant effects of the pull-over. The sensitivity study revealed that the interaction behavior was greatly influenced by the board-pipe friction coefficient, the tension level in the wire between <b>board</b> and <b>trawl</b> net, the towing line drag properties and the direction of over-trawling. Due to the sensitivity of the input parameters, it was concluded that a proper validation against experimental tests is necessary for future work of similar kind. Further studies should aim to quantify the degree of non-conservatism present for nonperpendicular crossings and attempt to improve current design load recommendations by including more model parameters. Reeling operations with history-dependent material behavior and extensive contact interactions along the material transport route are often not feasible to simulate with conventional finite element software. This relates to contact-related convergence problems and the need for long meshes with small and equal-sized elements giving poor numerical efficiency. These issues were successfully solved by developing a Lagrangian-Eulerian beam formulation that enabled for a virtually fixed mesh in space. The proposed formulation was subjected to various benchmark tests where it was demonstrated to provide similar accuracy as the conventional Lagrangian method. In recent years, subsea contractors have experienced torsional failures in spoolbasevessel load-out operations of flexible pipes. An idealized finite element model was therefore established to gain insight into such operations and to identify the mechanisms responsible for the generated torque. Torsional failures were identified for three different mechanisms and strategies to avoid them were proposed. A comparison study against a physical load-out operation should be conducted in future work to quantify the ability to predict the torque and to reveal possible model deficiencies...|$|R

40|$|Master's thesis in Structural engineeringThe {{objective}} of this Master’s thesis was to investigate whether or not using protection covers made of reinforced concrete is a viable option for protection of subsea installations on the seabed. The main focus of the thesis is on the structural design of the cover. The original problem, raised by Subsea 7, was that in shallow waters of about 100 m depth, the protection covers made of GRP experience problems with on-bottom stability due to the hydrodynamic forces from currents and waves. Unless tons of ballast steel is added to increase {{the mass of the}} cover, and rock-dumping {{on the sides of the}} cover is performed, the covers are prone to be unstable or possibly moved by the currents and waves. The hypothesis behind the thesis is that the slightly higher density of concrete and the thicker walls of the concrete covers, as well as some slight changes to the typical shape of the cover, will make them heavy enough to be stable on the seabed on its own without added ballast weight and rock-dumping. The type of cover assessed in the thesis is a simple tunnel or arch cover, which is typically used to cover pipelines or spools. The inner diameter of the cover was set to 2 m, so that it can protect pipelines or spools up to size 16 ” with the necessary clearances to walls and roof. A 3 D model of the reinforced concrete cover was created, and a finite element analysis performed using the software Ansys® Workbench, Release 14. 5. The trawl design loads of 300 kN from NORSOK standard U- 001 was applied to the cover. A dynamic dropped object simulation on the reinforced concrete cover model was also performed. The analyses showed that the concrete protection covers had sufficient strength to withstand the force from the <b>trawl</b> <b>board</b> and to withstand the energy from the dropped objects without damaging the product underneath. A 2 D beam model of the cover was created in STAAD. Pro V 8 i in order to get the design forces and moments in the cover. The concrete protection cover was designed according to the concrete standard Eurocode 2. This design resulted in the necessary amount of reinforcement to withstand the design forces and moments, and proved that the cross-section of concrete and reinforcement of the protection cover was able to withstand the design loads from trawl gear impacts. A full scale dropped object test of impact energies 5 kJ, 20 kJ, 30 kJ and 50 kJ, according to NORSOK standard U- 001 was performed on doubly reinforced concrete protection covers of 215 mm thickness and inner radius of 1000 mm. The test was performed on concrete covers provided by Multiblokk AS. The objects used in the test had masses of 140 kg, 550 kg, 850 kg and 1400 kg and was dropped onto the cover from approximately 3, 7 m height. An initial test was performed on gravel on Multiblokk AS’ premises, and the four main tests were performed with the cover submerged in the basin at the laboratories at the University of Stavanger. The covers in the main tests cracked slightly, but none were penetrated or collapsed. The dropped object tests proved that the strength of the protection covers was more than enough to withstand the dropped object energies, and that the initial design of the cover is suitable to build upon further. Based on the results from the structural assessment of the cover, the tests and analyses, the concept of using concrete protection covers was found to be a feasible concept that should be investigated further and in more detail. Its heavy weight, high strength and the possibility of liberation from rock-dump requirements gives the concrete protection cover a competitive edge that is well worth exploring further...|$|R

40|$|In July/ August 1991 the Institute of Marine Research (IMR, Norway) {{performed}} a pairtrawling (two boat trawl) experiment with a surface trawl to catch young herring in the northem Norwegian Sea. 34 postsmolts and two 1 - sea-winter salmon were caught as bycatch. This {{was the first}} time that postsmolts were recorded in larger numbers during fishery in open sea in the North East Atlantic, although the area is believed to be the one of the main feeding areas for salmon during summer. A (one boat) pelagic research trawl has been developed by IMR for scientific surveys of the pelagic fish stocks. This trawl, an Åkra trawl, can be rigged both for mid water and surface trawling (0 - ~ 25 m), and is currently in use on all pelagic research cruises.

40|$|Accurate {{interpretation}} of recent variability observed in fish populations, species compositions, distribution ranges or ecological indicators, depends on {{knowledge of their}} past dynamics and historical states. The onset of systematic fisheries data collection typically lagged decades or even centuries behind modern fishing exploits. As a consequence, pre-disturbed reference points and descriptions of subsequent change are rarely available. A remarkably detailed set of historical trawl survey data from South Africa provided such a rare opportunity. Government-funded exploration of the Agulhas Bank fishery potential resulted in meticulously-documented trawl survey data from 1897 - 1904, when prior human impacts on those resources were negligible. Although they used less effective technology, the information recorded and methods used were similar to modern surveys. This thesis investigated change in demersal fish fauna of the Agulhas Bank and documents comparisons between historical trawl surveys and modern re-enactments at the same locations. In comparing trawl survey catches over multiple decades or among different periods, unquantified changes in fishing power pose a key challenge. The shape, size, materials, mesh sizes and speed at which trawl nets are dragged, interact with the behaviour, {{size and shape of}} fish, influencing fishing performance. To accurately compare current catch rates with those of historical trawl surveys, the same trawl gear and methods were carefully replicated in repeat surveys at three sites. An investigation of literature and photographs of the original vessel and equipment were conducted to support the construction of a replica 'Granton' otter trawl net. The net was composed of Manila hemp with a headline length of 27 m (90 ft) and was attached to flat wooden <b>trawl</b> <b>boards.</b> The historical towing speed was estimated as 1. 34 m s⁻¹ (2. 6 knots). Three parts of the shallow Agulhas Bank that were surveyed 111 years prior, were re-surveyed in 2015. Species composition was contrasted between the historical and re-survey periods by way of unconstrained ordination, permutational multivariate analysis of variance and tests of the homogeneity of multivariate group dispersions. Taxa discerning between periods were identified with similarity percentage analyses. Changes of standardised catch between periods were tested for 27 taxa, using a non-parametric bootstrap approach. Proportions among size-classes, recorded for three taxa, were tested using Fisher's exact test. Results revealed a substantially transformed demersal catch assemblage, where the period effect explained almost half of the measured variance among samples. These changes included the disappearance or heavy depletion of kob (Argyrosomus spp., absent in re-surveys), panga (Pterogymnus laniarius; 2. 4 % of historical catch abundance) and east coast sole (Austroglossus pectoralis; 4. 6 % of historical catch abundance), which had jointly contributed 70 - 84 % of historical catch composition. Average re-survey catches were largely made up of gurnards (Chelidonichthys spp.; 3 792 % of historical abundance), horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus; 4 738 % of historical abundance), spiny dogfish (Squalus spp.; 3 121 % of historical abundance), hake (Merluccius capensis; 558 % of historical abundance) and white sea catfish (Galeichthys feliceps; 13 863 % of historical abundance). Analysis of available length information confirmed the expectation that fish sizes (specifically M. capensis and A. pectoralis) had declined. This implies that comparisons by weight would be more severe for declined abundances and less severe for those that increased, relative to contrasts of numerical abundance. Habitat preferences as well as geographic and depth distribution appeared to separate the taxa that increased from those that declined. These factors, together with reproductive and growth characteristics, as well as indirect trophic impacts, likely shaped the responses of demersal fauna to fishing and other human impacts during the 111 years between trawl surveys. An assessment of distribution changes of 44 common demersal taxa was undertaken. These analyses were restricted to the last 30 years of trawl survey data as the units and spatio-temporal resolution of prior data were incompatible. Standardised catches were used from annual spring and autumn south coast trawl surveys conducted by the government fisheries department. Geostatistical delta-generalised linear mixed models were used to predict species distribution functions, which were used to calculate annual estimates of latitude/longitude centres of gravity and effective areas occupied by each population. Average trends over the study period (1986 - 2016) were assessed using a Bayesian state-space model. Of nine species found to have a trend in average location, six moved westward or south-westward, while three moved eastward or north-eastward. Two species showed a trend of contracting spatial extent and one showed an expansion. Across the entire assemblage combined, there was a significant contraction in extent and a westward shift in average location. These assemblage-wide average trends are interpreted to be driven by climate forcing. Fishing impacts are expected to have contributed to the eastward movement in centre of gravity for kob, lesser sandshark (Rhinobatos annulatus) and white stumpnose (Rhabdosargus globiceps). Interpretation of these distribution shifts is hampered by a lack of knowledge on subsurface hydrographic trends on the Agulhas Bank, which is identified as a research priority. My research revealed substantial change in demersal fish communities on South Africa's Agulhas Bank and adds novel insight to the history underlying current states of demersal ecosystems. Valuable additions include a) documentation {{of the extent to which}} demersal assemblages have transformed during the last century at three representative inshore sites; b) estimates of current abundances relative to pre-disturbed baselines at those sites, which c) highlights drastic local depletion for certain taxa and d) reveals substantial abundance increases of certain species during the post-industrial fishing period; e) novel evidence of distribution trends in south coast demersal species; and f) identification of trends in the average distribution of the demersal fish assemblage, suspected to be climate-forced. Long-term comparisons, using minimally-disturbed baselines, revealed drastic transformation of the fish assemblage during a century of industrialisation, which points to trawling-induced alteration of benthic habitats and substantial changes in ecosystem structure. Besides the provision of novel historical context for current and future studies and decision-making, this work counters the erosive nature of shifting baselines in South Africa's marine environment...|$|R
