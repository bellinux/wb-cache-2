25|$|Hitchcock {{went down}} to his room to sleep. Three times he heard {{knocks on the door}} only to find no one there. After finding another cadet drunk, Hitchcock saw Davis head over to room No. 5 where {{thirteen}} cadets were partying. Davis, seeing Hitchcock's arrival, warned the other cadets. The captain entered the room, ordering one of the cadets to open up another cadet's <b>footlocker,</b> but the cadet refused. Hitchcock ordered no more disorder, left the room, and started looking for Thornton around 04:50.|$|E

50|$|Crate <b>footlockers</b> {{were more}} crude than plywood <b>footlockers</b> {{in that they}} were either made out of old ammo and packing crates, or {{followed}} along similar packing crate designs for simplicity and expediency of manufacture.|$|R

50|$|Most <b>footlockers</b> {{are made}} of plywood, but {{starting}} in World War II some <b>footlockers</b> were made out of a form of cardboard, which evolved into pressboard, covered with adhesive paper. Such materials were used to reduce cost of manufacture, although the materials also reduced durability when exposed to water and/or humidity.|$|R

He also packed food, coffee, vitamins, Dexedrine, Excedrin, earplugs, jugs of water, matches, lighter fluid, rope, binoculars, a machete, three knives, a {{transistor}} radio, toilet paper, a razor, {{and a bottle of}} deodorant. He put khaki coveralls on over his shirt and jeans.|$|E
2500|$|Violence {{continued}} sporadically on O'Connell Street {{for another}} hour or so. The Gardaí, advancing from {{the northern end of}} the street gradually pushed the rioters back southwards. The most sustained violence took place around the General Post Office building, where the rioters initially sat down in protest and then, several of them having been batoned, regrouped behind burning barricades and threw rocks, paving slabs and one or possibly two petrol bombs at Gardaí. Several Gardaí, protesters and a number of journalists from RTÉ and TV3 were injured. RTÉ's chief news correspondent, Charlie Bird was singled out for attack by some rioters and was kicked and punched while being called an [...] "Orange bastard" [...] before being rescued by the Garda SDU officers. Charlie Bird {{had been a member of}} the Workers' Party of Ireland which had split from Sinn Féin in 1970 and was seen as highly critical of the Republican Movement. However some of the violence appeared to be entirely random in its targets. For instance several bystanders were attacked and a woman who was five months pregnant was punched in the stomach. The woman later sent a text message to NewsTalk 106 to thank the Gardaí and ambulance service who looked after her after the incident. In addition, the windows of several businesses, including Foot Locker, Schuh, and Ulster Bank near O'Connell Bridge, were smashed and at least one shop (<b>Footlocker</b> shoe shop) was looted. Among those arrested for looting this shop were a number of foreign nationals as well as locals – indicating that in the latter stages of the riot, much of the disturbances were opportunistic – inspired by vandalism or desire for theft rather than politically motivated.|$|E

[...] While the US government has begun the process of prosecuting contractors that stole American tax dollars, the Iraqi government currently has no means of reacquiring Iraqi assets that were stolen by US contractors.

50|$|On {{the morning}} of the third day the Americans overran a PAVN bivouac and killed 54 troops. Why the Vietnamese had not fled was a quandary until members of the Hatchet Force {{discovered}} a bunker buried beneath 12 feet of earth. Inside they found a huge cache of maps and documents. They had overrun the PAVN logistical headquarters that controlled all of Laotian Route 165. Two <b>footlockers</b> were quickly filled with the intelligence haul, and the Hatchet Force then began to look for a way out. The North Vietnamese were closing in, but McCarley, instead of moving toward an LZ large enough for the extraction of the entire force, dropped off elements at three separate (and smaller) landing zones, catching the PAVN unprepared.|$|R
25|$|Between 11 September and 13 September 1970, {{a covert}} {{incursion}} took place into southeastern Laos, which {{was led by}} a Hatchet Force, {{in order to create}} a diversion for an offensive by the Royal Lao Army against the People's Army of Vietnam. 16 Americans and 110 Montagnard tribesmen. The mission, commanded by Captain Eugene McCarley, landed 60 miles to the west of their launch site at Dak To. Equipment caches and enemy troop dispositions were located and bombarded from the air, despite constant enemy contact, and two <b>footlockers</b> of intelligence were retrieved. The Hatchet Force then divided into three teams and were evacuated, leaving at least 54 PAVN soldiers killed. The raid would attract controversy in 1998 over the allegedly fabricated CNN report of the use of Sarin, and other alleged war crimes by Peter Arnett, Producer April Oliver, Producer Jack Smith, Sr. Producer Pam Hill, and others.|$|R

50|$|Plywood footlockers are {{a common}} type of <b>footlocker</b> used by the U.S. Army. They {{generally}} follow similar size and designs, undergoing only minor cosmetic changes in color and materials (from 1/2 in plywood to 1+1/4 in plywood, depending on war material needs and/or desire to reduce weight and cost of manufacture and cost of shipping). The corners are reinforced with straps of metal riveted to the locker, and had thick wooden handles on both sides for lifting by hand. After World War II, collapsible metal handles would replace the protruding wooden grips, so that each <b>footlocker</b> occupied less space and could be packed tighter for transportation. Each <b>footlocker</b> came with an internal 1/4 in (or thinner) plywood tray which could store {{some of the smaller}} items used by a soldier, and the larger items were kept below the tray.|$|E

5000|$|It {{has been}} alleged that {{large amounts of}} American tax dollars and seized Iraqi {{revenues}} were lost by the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA). One audit put the total number as high as $8.8 billion.

2500|$|An average day {{typically}} {{begins at}} 5:00. Reveille is sounded and all recruits present themselves for accountability. After personal hygiene and morning clean-up, recruits will perform physical training (only on Monday through Saturday). After the morning meal, the recruits begin the day's scheduled training, which may include classes, drill or martial arts. On Sundays, recruits are offered {{the morning to}} attend various religious services and personal time (often called [...] "Square-Away Time"). After the noon meal, the day's training continues until the evening meal, typically around 17:00 to 18:00 (5:00 to 6:00pm). After this time, recruits will have hygiene time to shower, clean their weapons and clean their barracks. Recruits also get roughly 1 hour of square away time after this, personal time for recruits to engage in personal activities such as preparing uniforms or equipment, writing letters, working out or doing laundry. Recruits are not free from their Drill Instructors (DIs) or allowed to leave the squad bay during this time. In preparation to sleep, recruits may hydrate, pray together for five minutes, ensure <b>footlockers</b> and rifles are locked and often recite the Rifleman's Creed or Marines' Hymn before lights-out. Lights-out can range from 20:00 to 22:00 (8:00 to 10:00pm), depending on the next day's activities.|$|R
5000|$|Blatchford {{immediately}} {{set about}} making changes in Volunteer support services, eliminating some, changing others, and consolidating other services. In {{a memo to}} Country Directors Blatchford said [...] "The decisions reached affect a number of services to the Volunteers which in actuality are restrictions on the Volunteers' freedom to manage their own affairs. The decisions are {{in keeping with the}} philosophy that we will eliminate all activities which do not directly promote the Volunteers' ability to satisfy their responsibility to the best counbies." [...] Among the services eliminated were Peace Corps booklockers, the pre-service clothing allowance, and payment for unaccompanied air freight and <b>footlockers.</b> [...] Blatchford also eliminated the requirement that volunteers could not return to the United States during their Peace Corps service for vacations. [...] "In principle, the Peace Corps still believes that it is to the Volunteer's advantage, and the advantage of the relationship he must maintain with his host country workers, to vacation within his assigned country or region. At the same time, the restriction on travel to countries such as the US and Europe is undesirable because it discourages Volunteers from assuming full responsibility for important personal decisions relating to Peace Corps service," [...] said the new policy.|$|R
