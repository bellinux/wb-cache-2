Although the initial installation cost can be 10 to 30 times more than lower-density plantings, the long-range returns can far exceed the traditional plantings. However, to be viable as a commercial <b>rootstock,</b> <b>dwarfing</b> <b>rootstocks</b> must be adapted to a range of agro-climatic conditions, moderately disease resistant, high yielding, and produce quality fruit...|$|R
500|$|Because apples do not breed true when planted as seeds, {{grafting}} {{is generally}} {{used to produce}} new apple trees. The rootstock used for {{the bottom of the}} graft can be selected to produce trees of a large variety of sizes, as well as changing the winter hardiness, insect and disease resistance, and soil preference of the resulting tree. <b>Dwarf</b> <b>rootstocks</b> can be used to produce very small trees (less than [...] high at maturity), which bear fruit earlier in their life cycle than full size trees. <b>Dwarf</b> <b>rootstocks</b> for apple trees can be traced as far back as 300 BC, to the area of Persia and Asia Minor. Alexander the Great sent samples of dwarf apple trees to Aristotle's Lyceum. <b>Dwarf</b> <b>rootstocks</b> became common by the 15th century, and later went through several cycles of popularity and decline throughout the world. The majority of the rootstocks used today to control size in apples were developed in England in the early 1900s. The East Malling Research Station conducted extensive research into rootstocks, and today their rootstocks are given an [...] "M" [...] prefix to designate their origin. Rootstocks marked with an [...] "MM" [...] prefix are Malling-series cultivars later crossed with trees of 'Northern Spy' in Merton, England.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT- Over {{the last}} 60 years, {{planting}} densities for apple have increased as improved management {{systems have been}} developed. <b>Dwarfing</b> <b>rootstocks</b> have been {{the key to the}} dramatic changes in tree size, spacing and early production. The Malling series of <b>dwarfing</b> <b>rootstocks</b> (M. 9 and M. 26) have been the most important <b>dwarfing</b> <b>rootstocks</b> in the world but are poorly adapted in some areas of the world and they are susceptible to the bacterial disease fire blight and the soil disease complex, apple replant disease which limits their uses in some areas. Rootstock breeding programs in several parts of the world are developing improved rootstocks with resistance to fire blight, and replant disease, and improved cold hardiness and yield efficiency. A second important trend has been the increasing importance of new cultivars. New cultivars have provided opportunities for higher prices until they are over-produced. A new trend is the “variety club ” in which variety owners manage the production and marketing of a new unique cultivar to bring higher prices to the growers and variety owners. This has led to many fruit growers being unable to plant or grow some new cultivars. Important rootstock and cultivar genes have been mapped and can be used in marker assisted selection of future rootstock and cultivar selections. Other important improvements in apple culture include the development of pre-formed trees, the development of minimal pruning strategies and limb angle bending which have also contributed to the dramatic changes in early production in the 2 nd- 5 th years after planting...|$|R

50|$|One {{theory is}} that replant disease {{is due to a}} whole menagerie of tree {{pathogens}} - fungi, bacteria, nematodes, viruses and other organisms. These parasitise target the living tissues of the mature tree, hastening senility and death, and survive in the soil and decaying roots after the tree has died. Putting a young traumatised tree with an immature root system into this 'broth' of pathogens can be too much for an infant tree to cope with. Any new root growth is rapidly and heavily colonised, so that shoot growth is virtually zero. This is especially true if it is on a <b>dwarfing</b> <b>rootstock,</b> which by its nature will be relatively inefficient. As a rule, replant disease persists for around fifteen years in the soil, although this varies with local conditions. Pathogens survive in dead wood and organic matter until exposed to predation by their home rotting away, and will also depend on whether the original orchard was planted with dwarf or standard trees. Standards have more vigorous - therefore larger - roots, and are thus likely to take longer to degrade.|$|E

40|$|The Malling 9 (M. 9) <b>dwarfing</b> <b>rootstock</b> {{is widely}} used in apple {{breeding}} and commercial cultivation to shorten the juvenile period, reduce vegetative growth and increase flowering of the scion. A segment of M. 9 stem (interstock) or M. 9 bark grafted into a compound tree can cause significant dwarfing of the scion, suggesting that the dwarfing signal may be vascular derived. To better understand how the M. 9 rootstock alters the growth {{and development of the}} scion, we compared gene expression in vascular-enriched tissue from dwarfing and vigorous rootstocks. RNA sequencing indicated that key flowering genes were upregulated in M. 9 relative to a vigorous rootstock, Malling 793 (M. 793). An in-depth analysis of the apple FT/TFL 1 gene family identified four new members: MdMFTa, MdMFTb, MdBFTa and MdBFTb. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed the higher expression of MdFT 1 / 2, MdBFTa/b, MdCO, MdGI, and MdSOC 1 in two different dwarfing rootstocks (M. 9 and Malling 27 (M. 27)) relative to M. 793. Both MdFT 1 / 2, and MdBFTa/b were expressed at higher levels in multiple <b>dwarfing</b> <b>rootstock</b> accessions relative to more vigorous genotypes. In perennial species, FT promotes flowering, and has additional roles in accelerating the transition from juvenility to maturity, and regulating cycles of seasonal growth and termination. Apple dwarfing rootstocks reduce the juvenile phase and promote both flowering and early shoot termination. Our work supports a role for MdFT in promoting flowering and earlier shoot termination. We suggest that upregulation of a suite of flowering genes including MdFT, and possibly MdBFT, in the vasculature is part of the underlying mechanism of apple dwarfing rootstocks. Genes involved with response to biotic and abiotic stress and disease were also upregulated in the M. 9 rootstock, suggesting that stress, possibly mediated by JA and ABA signalling, also plays a role in the M. 9 -induced phenotype...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The primary {{physiological}} mechanism influencing tree vigour in size-controlling rootstocks of peach has {{been related to}} the hydraulic conductance of the rootstock. Differences in rootstock hydraulic conductance are a function of rootstock xylem vessel characteristics. The present research examined whether the vigour and xylem vessel characteristics of the rootstock influence the xylem characteristics of the scion. We tested whether using a size-controlling rootstock genotype as an inter-stem influences the xylem vessel characteristics of either the rootstock below the inter-stem or the scion above it and vice versa. METHODOLOGY: Anatomical measurements (diameter and frequency) of xylem vessels were determined {{above and below the}} graft unions of the trunks of peach trees with differing scion/rootstock combinations. The three peach rootstocks were 'Nemaguard' (vigorous), 'P 30 - 135 ' (intermediate vigour) and 'K 146 - 43 ' (dwarfing). The vigorous scion cultivar was 'O'Henry'. The inter-stem experiment involved trees with 'Nemaguard' (vigorous) as the rootstock, 'K 146 - 43 ' (dwarfing) as the inter-stem and 'O'Henry' as the scion. Based on anatomical measurements, we calculated the theoretical axial xylem conductance of each stem piece and rootstock genotype with the Hagen-Poiseuille law. PRINCIPAL RESULTS: Xylem vessel dimensions of rootstocks varied in conjunction with tree vigour. Scion xylem vessel dimensions of different scion/rootstock combinations were only marginally affected by rootstock genotype. The inter-stem sections from the dwarfing genotype ('K 146 - 43 ') had narrower vessels and a lower calculated hydraulic conductance than the xylem from either the vigorous rootstock below ('Nemaguard') or the scion above ('O'Henry'). CONCLUSIONS: Rootstock genotype only marginally affected scion xylem vessel characteristics. Thus the xylem vessel characteristics of the <b>dwarfing</b> <b>rootstock</b> genotypes appear to influence tree growth directly rather than through an effect on the xylem characteristics of the scion. A <b>dwarfing</b> <b>rootstock</b> genotype used as an inter-stem appeared to work as a physical restriction to water movement, reducing potential xylem flow and conductance of the whole tree...|$|E
