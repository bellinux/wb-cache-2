5|$|In the {{developing}} world, birth control increases economic growth due to there being fewer dependent children {{and thus more}} women participating in the workforce. Women's earnings, assets, body mass index, and their children's schooling and body mass index all improve with greater access to birth control. Family planning via the use of modern birth control {{is one of the}} most cost-effective health interventions. For <b>every</b> <b>dollar</b> spent, the United Nations estimates that two to six dollars are saved. These cost savings are related to preventing unplanned pregnancies and decreasing the spread of sexually transmitted illnesses. While all methods are beneficial financially, the use of copper IUDs resulted in the greatest savings.|$|E
5|$|Fare is payable by MetroCard. Since {{this card}} enables free {{transfers}} for a continuing {{ride on the}} subway and bus systems, for many more riders there is effectively no fare at all for riding SIR. Riders are also allowed to transfer between a Staten Island bus, SIR, and a Manhattan bus or subway near South Ferry. Because of this, the SIR's farebox recovery ratio in 2001 was 0.16that is, for <b>every</b> <b>dollar</b> of expense, 16 cents was recovered in fares, the lowest ratio of MTA agencies. The low farebox recovery ratio {{is part of the}} reason the MTA wishes to merge the SIR with the subway proper which will simplify the accounting and subsidization of what is essentially a single line.|$|E

5|$|Though Patton had ambitions {{to enact}} {{education}} reform {{early in his}} administration, his financial adviser, James R. Ramsey, convinced him to propose a conservative budget in the first legislative session. The two developed a plan to modernize the state government, making it more efficient. State employees were leery of increased efficiency, believing it was a code word for cutting state jobs. Patton dispelled this notion by promising no involuntary layoffs. Patton also anticipated difficulty persuading legislators to invest an estimated $100million in equipment and processes to realize improved efficiency. However, when economists projected a budget surplus for 1996, Patton agreed to invest half of it in capital projects in exchange for using the other half for measures to improve government efficiency. Patton formed an Office for Technology and made improvements in the compatibility and interoperability of the state's computer systems that were recommended by his son, Chris. Investments of $23.3million yielded a return of $300million in state revenue. By the time Patton's efficiency program was fully implemented, the state was realizing an annual return of 75cents for <b>every</b> <b>dollar</b> initially invested.|$|E

25|$|A {{third group}} makes little {{distinction}} between debt and taxes, this group emphasizes reduction in spending rather than tax policy or debt reduction.

25|$|A 2012 International Monetary Fund study {{concluded}} that the US financial sector has grown so large that it is slowing economic growth. New York University economist Thomas Philippon supported those findings, estimating that the US spends $300 billion too much on financial services per year, and that the sector needs to shrink by 20%. Harvard University and University of Chicago economists agreed, calculating in 2014 that workers {{in research and development}} add $5 to the GDP for each dollar they earn, but finance industry workers cause the GDP to shrink by $0.60 for <b>every</b> <b>dollar</b> they are paid.

25|$|<b>Every</b> <b>dollar</b> ($1) that {{is spent}} on {{pesticides}} for crops yields four dollars ($4) in crops saved.

In general, farmers benefit from having an increase in crop yield and from being able to grow a variety of crops throughout the year. Consumers of agricultural products also benefit from being able to afford the vast quantities of produce available year-round. The general public also benefits from the use of pesticides for the control of insect-borne diseases and illnesses, such as malaria. The use of pesticides creates a large job market within the agrichemical sector.|$|E
