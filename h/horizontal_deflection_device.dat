Mineral particles with different densities and susceptibilities could be deflected to different positions, thus producing groups of similar types of particles.

Laboratory tests for controlled low strength materials with bottom ash and recycled in-situ soil have been carried out. The optimum mixing ratios were 25 %– 45 % of in-situ soil, 30 % of bottom ash, 10 %– 20 % of fly ash, 0 %– 3 % of crumb rubber, 3 % of cement, and 22 % of water. Each mixture satisfied the standard specifications: a minimum 20 cm of flowability and 127 kPa of unconfined compressive strength. The average secant modulus (E 50) was (0. 07 – 0. 08) qu.

40|$|Abstract. It {{has been}} {{observed}} during earthquakes that the soft-storey failure of an upper floor of a building results in large impact load acting on structural members of the lower storeys. It may further lead to progressive collapse of the whole structure substantially intensifying human losses and material damages. The aim {{of this paper is}} to show the results of a numerical analysis focused on the behaviour of multi-storey steel frame building that suffers from a soft-storey failure under ground motion excitation. A numerical model of the structure was created in FEM computer software and was exposed to an impact that would have been generated after a soft-storey failure due to falling of the upper floors. During the analysis, the whole structure was exposed to ground motion excitation and different moments have been chosen for the impact so as to estimate the most critical moment for the structure. The results of the study show that not only the value of the impact force is crucial but also the moment when the impact occurs. This is due to the fact that <b>horizontal</b> <b>deflection</b> of the supporting members (steel columns) varies during the time of the excitation. It {{has been observed}} that the most critical moment for the building for being subjected to a vertical impact is when the <b>horizontal</b> <b>deflection</b> is close to its peak...|$|R
