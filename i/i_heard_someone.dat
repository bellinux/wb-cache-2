When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>someone</b> explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have music you can live vicariously through, and that's what a lot of people have told me this record has been for them.|$|E

2500|$|Lewis {{is widely}} hailed {{as one of}} the most {{influential}} pianists in the history of rock and roll. [...] In an often quoted tribute, Elvis Presley once said that if he could play the piano like Lewis he would quit singing. [...] Lewis's pivotal role in popularizing the piano in rock and roll is indisputable. [...] Up until his arrival, the music had been primarily associated with guitars, but his early Sun recordings and television appearances pushed the instrument to the forefront. [...] Lewis was also an incendiary showman who often played with his fists, elbows, feet, and backside, sometimes climbing on top of the piano during gigs and even apocryphally setting it on fire. [...] Like Chuck Berry's guitar playing, Lewis's piano style has become synonymous with rock and roll, having influenced generations of piano players. [...] In a 2013 interview with Leah Harper, Elton John recalls that up until [...] "Great Balls of Fire," [...] "the piano playing that I had heard had been more sedate. [...] My dad collected George Shearing records, but this was the first time <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>someone</b> beat the shit out of a piano. When I saw Little Richard at the Harrow Granada, he played it standing up, but Jerry Lee Lewis actually jumped on the piano! This was astonishing to me, that people could do that. Those records had such a huge effect on me, and they were just so great. I learned to play like that." [...] Lewis is primarily known for his [...] "boogie woogie" [...] style, which is characterized by a regular left hand bass figure and dancing beat, but his command of the instrument and highly individualistic style set him apart. [...] Appearing on Memphis Sounds with George Klein in 2011, Lewis credited his older piano-playing cousin Carl McVoy as being a crucial influence, stating, [...] "He was a great piano player, a great singer, and a nice looking man, carried himself real well. [...] I miss Carl very much." [...] Lewis also cited Moon Mullican as a source of inspiration. [...] Although almost entirely self-taught, Lewis conceded to biographer Rich Bragg in 2014 that Paul Whitehead, a blind pianist from Meadville, Mississippi, was another key influence on him in his earliest days playing clubs, confiding, [...] "Paul Whitehead done a lot. [...] His lesson was worth a billion dollars to me...He taught me. [...] I'd sit beside him, and say, 'Mr. Paul, can you show me exactly how you do that?' [...] Mr. Paul was good to me." ...|$|E

60|$|Like one who drams I {{passed down}} the outer hall where stood the silent guards as statues might, and {{out through the}} archway.

60|$|I {{could not}} {{doubt that this}} was the Miss Stapleton of whom I had been told, since ladies of any sort must be few upon the moor, and I remembered that <b>I</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>someone</b> {{describe}} her as being a beauty. The woman who approached me was certainly that, and of a most uncommon type. There could not have been a greater contrast between brother and sister, for Stapleton was neutral tinted, with light hair and gray eyes, while she was darker than any brunette whom I have seen in England--slim, elegant, and tall. She had a proud, finely cut face, so regular that it might have seemed impassive {{were it not for the}} sensitive mouth and the beautiful dark, eager eyes. With her perfect figure and elegant dress she was, indeed, a strange apparition upon a lonely moorland path. Her eyes were on her brother as I turned, and then she quickened her pace towards me. I had raised my hat and was about to make some explanatory remark, when her own words turned all my thoughts into a new channel.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first people}} to hear hadith were the companions who {{preserved}} it and then conveyed it to those after them. Then the generation following them received it, thus conveying it to those after them and so on. So a companion would say, [...] "I heard the Prophet say such and such." [...] The Follower would then say, [...] "I heard a companion say, <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> the Prophet."

40|$|<b>I</b> {{recently}} <b>heard</b> <b>someone</b> {{say that}} Dr Robb W ilmot, the former Chief Executive of ICL, was launching a crusade; a crusade to persuade government {{and other big}} businesses in Europe to seriously utilise and adopt management development practices and techniques. The reason is simple- Europeans,. including Britons, are as inventive as any in the world, but are falling behind the Americans and Japanese {{in terms of making}} sure that products are well manufactured, packaged, marketed and sold. In other words, the Europeans, as much as anyone, have a high capacity for innovation, but are poor in implementation. Organisations that consistently perform poorly in the marketplace do so because of poor market share. Poor market share or loss of market share occurs because people do not wish to purchase your services or product. Organisations that have faced substantial financial and market share losses are ones that were unable to see trends in the marketplace change, in order to produce those goods or services that the market required at the standards the market demands and at prices the market can sustain. Organisations that face a downturn in their business do so because of manageria...|$|R

I rushed among them, went flat, got rid of my vest after infinite wriggling, and stood a free man again, panting and scared, as the policeman and three of the shopmen came round the corner. They made a rush for the vest and pants, and collared the trousers. 'He's dropping his plunder,' said one of the young men. 'He must be somewhere here.' ...|$|E

The best I did was to scrape alongside the sub. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>someone</b> shriek an order into the engine-room; the boat shuddered and trembled to the sudden reversing of the engines, and our speed quickly lessened.

40|$|There {{were about}} 1200 people present {{this year for}} six days of {{tutorials}} and workshops, and three parallel tracks of papers and other talks. It was useful to have two of us to cover different sessions. The full programme is available online (see above) and we both have copies of the proceedings. I have a password to download electronic copies of individual papers if anybody wants one. I was particularly interested in virtual machine technology and there were several related talks. This {{seems to be one}} of the hot topics with a lot of potential, although many people (worryingly for me) felt that it wasn’t quite ready for very serious production use (commercial application provision). However, <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> that <b>someone</b> ran a whole tutorial with a VM for each student on his own laptop! There were a lot of Mac laptops in evidence (probably more than 50 %) and I was really pleased with the way that mine performed. iChat over Bonjour was really common and made it easy to find people in such a large venue. iChat video worked surprisingly well to communicate with people at home. I spent a lot of time talking to people about configuration issues, and some time being persuaded into chairing next year’s conference- so I’ll definitely be on the lookout for papers for next year...|$|R
6000|$|In summer, 1770, Mrs. Ricketts <b>heard</b> <b>someone</b> walk to {{the foot}} of her bed in her own room, [...] "the {{footsteps}} as distinct as ever <b>I</b> <b>heard,</b> myself perfectly awake and collected". Nobody could be discovered in the chamber. Mrs. Ricketts boldly clung to her room, and was only now and then disturbed by [...] "sounds of harmony," [...] and heavy thumps, down stairs. After this, and early in 1771, she was [...] "frequently sensible of a hollow murmuring that seemed to possess the whole house: it was independent of wind, being equally heard on the calmest nights, and it was a sound I had never been accustomed to hear".|$|R

60|$|The day {{passed without}} any further event, except {{the arrival of}} our meals, for which we had no great appetite. The night came, earlier than usual because of the clouds, and we fell asleep, or rather {{into a series of}} dozes. Once I thought that <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>someone</b> {{stirring}} in the huts behind us, but as it was followed by silence I took no more notice. At length the light broke very slowly, for now the clouds were denser than ever. Shivering with the cold, Marût and I made a visit to the camel-drivers, who were not allowed to enter our house. On going into their hut we saw to our horror that only two of them remained, seated stonily upon the floor. We asked where the third was. They replied they did not know. In the middle of the night, they said, men had crept in, who seized, bound and gagged him, then dragged him away. As {{there was nothing to be}} said or done, we returned to breakfast filled with horrid fears.|$|E

To abandon all these valuable possessions of yours to a rapacious enemy was more than I could bear. So I put {{every one of them}} in the pit, and then, as I thought <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>someone</b> coming, got in myself and pulled down the stone. But, Mr. Quatermain, soon afterwards the enemy added arson to murder and pillage, and the whole place began to blaze. I could hear the fire roaring above and a little later the ashes covered the exit so that I could no longer lift the stone, which indeed grew too hot to touch. Here, then, I sat all night in the most suffocating heat, very much afraid, Mr. Quatermain, lest the two kegs of gunpowder that were with me should explode, till at last, just as I had abandoned hope and prepared to die like a tortoise baked alive by a bushman, I heard your welcome voice. And Mr. Quatermain, if there is any soothing ointment to spare, I shall be much obliged, for I am scorched all over." ...|$|E
2500|$|Liu Ye, {{a friend}} of Lu Su, once {{wrote a letter to}} him: [...] "Now, warlords and heroes have emerged all over the Empire. I believe {{the time has come for}} me to put my talents to good use. I am in a rush to fetch my mother but I will be {{dropping}} by Dongcheng County for a while. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> that recently, <b>someone</b> called Zheng Bao (鄭寶) has rallied thousands of followers in Chaohu and the lands under their control are very fertile. Many people in Lujiang Commandery are planning to join him after hearing about him – not to mention myself. I observe his situation and see that he is still gathering followers. You should act fast and not miss this opportunity." [...] Lu Su agreed with what Liu Ye said. After his grandmother's funeral, Lu Su returned to Qu'e County and made plans to leave Jiangdong and head north to join Zheng Bao. However, he found out that Zhou Yu had fetched his mother to Wu Commandery (吳郡; around present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu) so he went to Wu Commandery to speak to Zhou Yu.|$|R
40|$|In most circles I’m {{embarrassed to}} use the term psychagogy, because no one seems to know what it is outside {{of a small group of}} scholars.

When I described this course of study to a former seminary professor, he wanted to know what that had to do with ministry in the church. I want to take this opportunity to answer the burning questions about psychagogy: What is it, How does it help us to understand Paul, and What difference does it make? What is it? We’re familiar with the term psychology. It’s a study of the human self or mind. Although the term is based on Greek words, it is not a term from Greek literature. Psychagog...|$|R
