500|$|Roz Laws {{writing for}} the Sunday Mercury felt there was [...] "plenty of chemistry" [...] present between Gilly and Steph. Their {{relationship}} was frequently commented on by the Daily Mail Jaci Stephen in her weekly soap column. She expressed disinterest in Steph and Cheryl's rivalry over Gilly, and found it implausible that Jem and Steph would quarrel over him. When the two finally admitted their feelings for one another in May 2010, Stephen accurately predicted that their happiness would be short-lived. She bemoaned the lack of subtlety in the scripting of the lead-up to their wedding, observing: [...] "Of course, {{you know that the}} moment she says that nothing <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> her marrying Gilly, the Grim Reaper will be pulling up in his hearse, shortly behind the wedding car." ...|$|E
500|$|Steph's {{relationships}} were {{a focal point}} of many reviews. The Daily Mirror Nicola Methven and Polly Hudson found a 2004 love triangle between Steph, her sister Debbie and love interest Dan Hunter (Andrew McNair) [...] "surprising compelling". Grace Dent of The Guardian observed of her failed engagement to Fernando: [...] "With the best will in the world, I don't feel that marriage {{was ever going to}} last". Dent had previously named Steph singing the Sugababes' [...] "About You Now" [...] at Max's funeral one of her four favourite soap moments of 2008.

500|$|The Beatles flew to India in February 1968, {{to visit}} the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram (after first meeting him on 24 August 1967, at the London Hilton hotel). Evans arrived in India {{a few days earlier}} to inspect the ashram, but as soon as Starr got off the plane, he demanded that Evans find a doctor, as his {{inoculation}} shots were causing him pain. Evans: “When we arrived at the local hospital, I tried to get immediate treatment for him , to be told curtly by the Indian doctor, 'He is not a special case and will have to wait his turn.' So off we go to pay a private doctor ten rupees for the privilege of hearing him say 'It will be all right'." [...] Evans wrote in his diary on 17 February 1968: [...] "The press really tried kicking down the gates into the Ashram, the Indian people on the Ashram called me half way through, but as soon as an Indian reporter told me [...] "No bloody foreigner <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> me in my own country", I cooled it." [...] Evans' diary says that he enjoyed his time in India: [...] "It's hard to believe that a week has already passed. I suppose the peace of mind and the serenity one achieves through meditation makes the time fly," [...] and that he also enjoyed the food, unlike Starr, who had brought a suitcase full of baked beans with him. After leaving India, Harrison and Evans flew to New York, visiting Bob Dylan and The Band, who were rehearsing at their Big Pink house/studio, in Woodstock.|$|E
60|$|Benham <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> that {{conflict}} {{very much as}} a man might go <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> a clock that is striking unwarrantably and amazingly. He <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> it because it annoyed his sense of human dignity.|$|R
50|$|On November 9, 2015 Sony {{announced}} that they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> producing Betamax Tapes in March 2016.|$|R

2500|$|Felicity Hampel SC, {{president}} {{of civil liberties}} group Liberty Victoria, replied in response to Hulls, [...] "Neither imprisonment in itself nor parole in itself <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> everybody from committing offences. What's important {{to bear in mind}} is that a person has to be sentenced for the offence they've committed, and that might mean that somebody gets a sentence that is proportionate for the crime, but it doesn't cure them of the dangerousness or the characteristic that makes them continue to offend".|$|E
6000|$|... "Short of {{locking up}} the balls and turning out the lights, I don't myself see how one <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> him," [...] sighed the Captain.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{all very}} well," [...] said Banks irritably, [...] "but Mazatlan is a {{well-known}} commercial port, and has English and American correspondents. There's a branch of that Boston firm--Potter, Potts & Potter--there. The new line of steamers <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> there regularly." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{little more}} {{conversation}} followed, {{and then the}} Rover boys asked Slade where he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop,</b> and said they might see him later.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Isobel, [...] "that's {{always the}} way; one is never left at leisure to follow one's own fancies in this world. To-morrow, for instance, {{my father and}} all his horrible friends--I don't know any of them, except one, but from past {{experience}} I presume them to be horrible--are coming down <b>to</b> lunch, and <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> for three days' partridge shooting. Their female belongings <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> also, or some of them are, which means that I shall have to look after them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Alton. [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> {{right where}} I am until there's {{light enough to}} trail them by. Do you know {{anything}} better, Tom?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{suffering}} {{of women is}} the {{suffering of}} all humanity," [...] Ransom returned. [...] "Do you think any movement <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> that--or all the lectures from now to doomsday? We are born to suffer--and to bear it, like decent people." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, indeed, she is not," [...] said Lady Holmhurst; [...] "she <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> {{with me and}} Dick. Miss Smithers saved Dick's life, you know, {{when the}} nurse, poor thing, had run away. And now, dear, you had better tell Mr. Meeson about the will." ...|$|E
6000|$|Emerson {{shook his}} head resignedly. [...] "Curious how you cling to that Freddie idea. Never mind! I'll come down to Blandings on Friday and we shall see what happens. Bear in mind the broad fact that you and I {{are going to be}} married, and that nothing on earth <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> us." ...|$|E

60|$|For {{a moment}} Francesca felt a {{stifling}} sensation of weakness, {{as though her}} heart <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> beating. Then she sat forward {{in her chair and}} spoke with energy, almost fierceness.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was getting}} pretty sultry for me. I said to myself, [...] "Is it {{possible}} she <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> there, {{and wait for}} me to speak? If she does, the conversation is blocked. A negro with a thousand tails is a topic which a person cannot talk upon fluently and instructively without more or less preparation. As to diving rashly into such a vast subject--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean it," [...] {{he assured}} her. [...] "As you know, a {{chairman}} must be elected this week, and that chairman, of course, will hold more power {{in his hand}} than any emperor of the past or any sovereign of the present. That leader <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> the war. He {{is going to bring}} peace to the world. It is a mighty post, Miss Abbeway." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He asks {{me in his}} letter," [...] Mrs. Conway {{said with}} a passing smile of amusement, [...] "if I can take in a young friend of his, Miss Mabel Withers. He says {{she has never been}} from home before, {{and that it would be}} a treat for her to get away and see a little of the world.

6000|$|... "I laid for three, miss," [...] she said, {{with great}} simplicity. [...] "You didn’t {{say whether the}} gentleman <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> or not; and there’s no harm done if he don’t." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Keona began it!" [...] {{said the}} savage, angrily. [...] "We thought our wars with the Christians <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop.</b> But Keona <b>is</b> bad. He put the war spirit into my people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stella," [...] she said, {{looking at}} her cousin with her big eyes full of tears, and her voice {{becoming}} unsteady, [...] "you have done a very, very cruel thing. You have ruined my life. Your father had done so much for my people, and now he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> it all and send me back to them. You can't imagine {{what it means to}} be thrown back into such poverty. It isn't for myself I mind; it is for their sakes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am not so}} sure of that. I am not so {{sure that}} the country <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> English. You laugh at me for reading the home papers, but I see things there that make me doubtful. The other party is in power now in England, and one does not know what they may do; you heard what uncle said to-night. They might give us up to the Boers. You must {{remember}} that we far-away people are only the counters with which they play their game." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd {{be glad to}} some time," [...] Brooks answered. [...] "But I {{can tell}} you this. If {{we can get the}} money, and I haven't asked for a penny yet, nothing in the shape of popular opinion <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> us. Idleness and drunkenness, deceit and filthy-mindedness, and all those vices which I admit are like a pestilence amongst these people, are sins which we are {{responsible}} for, not them, and, of course, we must suffer to some extent from them. But we've got to grapple with them. We shall be taken advantage of, and grossly deceived continually. I know of one or two cases already. We expect it--count upon it. But in the end we shall come out on the top. If we are consistent the thing will right itself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here {{is where}} the celebrated Sheffield cutlery comes from," [...] {{observed}} Roger, as the last stop was made. [...] "If we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> over I'd buy a pocket-knife for a souvenir." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop,</b> Bertie, you {{had better}} go back and fetch a blanket, it is chilly here; then if you like you can doze off again till your watch comes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An {{indefinite}} time: an old aunt of mine, Mrs. Velley, {{is coming}} out by next mail, and I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> with her when my brother goes back. Are you staying with Mrs. Carr?" ...|$|R
