50|$|The <b>IBM</b> <b>Music</b> <b>Feature</b> Card {{failed to}} gain much traction, {{mainly because of}} its high retail price at the time ($495), and aggressive, {{slightly}} superior competition by Roland with the internal LAPC-I (and MT-32 external sound module equivalent).|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 80s, sound was {{becoming}} {{the norm in}} computer games and as such, video game companies started supporting sound cards in their products. In {{the case of the}} <b>IBM</b> <b>Music</b> <b>Feature</b> Card, Sierra and MicroProse were the main companies who showed support.|$|E
50|$|The <b>IBM</b> <b>Music</b> <b>Feature</b> Card (simply {{referred}} to as the IBM PC Music Feature by IBM) and sometimes abbreviated as the IBM MFC, or just IMFC: is a professional-level sound card for the PC, and used the 8-bit ISA bus. The card made use of the Yamaha YM2164 chip which produces sound and music via FM synthesis.|$|E

50|$|The Yamaha YM2164 a.k.a.OPP (FM Operator Type P), is an FM {{synthesis}} sound chip {{developed by}} Yamaha, functionally identical to their YM2151 a.k.a. OPM. The OPP {{was used in}} various MIDI-based synthesizers by Yamaha - DX21, DX27, DX100, SFG-05, FB-01 (= a standalone SFG-05) - plus several licensed products: the <b>IBM</b> <b>Music</b> <b>Feature</b> Card (effectively an FB-01 on an ISA card) and Korg's DS-8 and Korg 707.|$|E
5000|$|In 1988 a {{panel of}} computer-game CEOs stated at the Consumer Electronics Show that the PC's limited sound {{capability}} prevented it from becoming the leading home computer, that it needed a $49-79 sound card with better capability than current products, and that once such hardware was widely installed their companies would support it. Sierra On-Line, which had pioneered supporting EGA and VGA video, and 3 1/2" [...] disks, that year promised to support AdLib, <b>IBM</b> <b>Music</b> <b>Feature,</b> and Roland MT-32 in its games; the cards cost $195 to $600. A 1989 Computer Gaming World survey found that 18 of 25 game companies planned to support AdLib, six Roland and Covox, and seven Creative Music System/Game Blaster.|$|E
50|$|With the SCI engine, Sierra dropped disk-based copy {{protection}} schemes {{in favor of}} requiring the user to enter a word from the manual, as the new-generation games were designed primarily to be installed and run from a hard disk. King's Quest IV was the first commercially released game for PC compatibles to support sound cards instead of only the standard built-in speaker. In addition to the familiar PC speaker and Tandy sound, it could utilize AdLib, CMS, Disney Sound Source, <b>IBM</b> <b>Music</b> <b>Feature</b> Card, or Roland boards. The new Sierra's Creative Interpreter engine allowed the game's designers to incorporate an orchestrated musical score along with more complex sound effects, a previously unattainable feat. To ensure an immersive soundtrack, composer William Goldstein was hired to write the game's musical score, totaling over 75 short music pieces.|$|E

5000|$|Sound {{cards for}} {{computers}} {{compatible with the}} IBM PC were very uncommon until 1988, which left the single internal PC speaker {{as the only way}} early PC software could produce sound and music. The speaker hardware was typically limited to square waves, which fit the common nickname of [...] "beeper". The resulting sound was generally described as [...] "beeps and boops". Several companies, most notably Access Software, developed techniques for digital sound reproduction over the PC speaker (see RealSound); the resulting audio, while barely functional, suffered from distorted output and low volume, and usually required all other processing to be stopped while sounds were played. Other home computer models of the 1980s included hardware support for digital sound playback, or music synthesis (or both), leaving the IBM PC at a disadvantage to them when it came to multimedia applications such as music composition or gaming. The initial design and marketing focuses of sound cards for the IBM PC platform were not based on gaming, but rather on specific audio applications such as music composition (AdLib Personal Music System, <b>IBM</b> <b>Music</b> <b>Feature</b> Card, Creative Music System), or on speech synthesis (Digispeech DS201, Covox Speech Thing, Street Electronics Echo).|$|E
