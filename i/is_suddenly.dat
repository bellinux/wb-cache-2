60|$|It changed. It {{changed as}} a lit house changes when its lights <b>are</b> <b>suddenly</b> extinguished. His eyes <b>were</b> <b>suddenly</b> eyes that <b>were</b> fixed, {{his smile was}} frozen on his lips, and he stood there still. He stood there, very gently swaying.|$|R
50|$|Supplies <b>are</b> <b>suddenly</b> {{cut down}} {{regardless}} of the amount stored to scare the population and extra rations <b>are</b> <b>suddenly</b> granted to boost morale in a bad time.

5|$|The {{relationship}} of the minuet (in F-sharp major) and the trio (in F-sharp minor) continues the overall tension between major and minor. The minuet features a startling harmonic shift: its second half <b>is</b> <b>suddenly</b> interrupted by a fortissimo D-major chord, far remote from the home key, before a chromatic passage leads back to the dominant of C-sharp major. The trio {{is linked to the}} minuet by the rhythmic similarities of their opening motifs.|$|E
5|$|The second {{mechanism}} {{may occur}} when the chest <b>is</b> <b>suddenly</b> decelerated, as occurs in vehicle accidents, producing a shearing force. The lungs are mobile in the chest cavity but their movement is more restricted near the hilum. Areas near the cricoid cartilage and carina are fixed to the thyroid cartilage and the pericardium respectively; thus if the airways move, they can tear at these points of fixation.|$|E

After Chris is {{accepted}} to Morningwood Academy, he is asleep in his bed for the night, and <b>is</b> <b>suddenly</b> attacked by a group of classmates, who stuff wads of dollar bills into their socks, and quickly begin beating him with the weapons. This scene is a parody of that of the infamous sequence shown in director Stanley Kubrick's 1987 war film Full Metal Jacket, in which the Marine recruits take turns striking Private Pyle with bars of soap wrapped in towels as punishment for frequently getting them in trouble.|$|E
5|$|Maria-sama ga Miterus story {{revolves}} around the students of the Lillian Girls' Academy and is character-driven, focusing on interactions between the characters rather than any sort of ongoing plot or goal to attain. When the story begins, Yumi Fukuzawa, a first-year student at Lillian, is praying {{in front of the}} Virgin Mary statue near the school entrance when she <b>is</b> <b>suddenly</b> approached by a cold second-year student named Sachiko Ogasawara who straightens Yumi's uniform neckerchief.

5|$|The {{narrative}} structure is alluded to in Legea minții, {{which is about}} discovering one's true calling. The plot follows its protagonist, a scholarly priest {{by the name of}} Andrei Pascu, as he finds himself in his work as a missionary of religion and cultural nationalism, despite being set back by poverty and revisited by his worldly past. Similar themes are developed elsewhere. In Popa Man, a lapsed priest and smuggler <b>is</b> <b>suddenly</b> confronted with the consequences of his actions, and destroys himself with drink. In Stana, named after its female protagonist, a war invalid is a passive witness to his wife's moral decay. When he dies, his wooden leg serves as a haunting reminder of his virtues, driving Stana to despair.|$|E

A story from Inaba Province, related by Inoue Enryō, tells of a girl with poor manual dexterity who <b>is</b> <b>suddenly</b> possessed by a tengu. The spirit wishes to rekindle the declining art of swordsmanship in the world. Soon a young samurai appears to whom the tengu has appeared in a dream, and the possessed girl instructs him as an expert swordsman.

Flynn returns Rapunzel to the palace, where she is finally reunited with her parents.|$|E

After an escape attempt, Cole is sedated and locked in a cell, but he disappears moments later, and wakes up back in his own time. Cole is interrogated by the scientists, who play a distorted voicemail message which asserts the association of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys with the virus. He is also shown photos of numerous people suspected of being involved, including Goines. The scientists offer Cole a second chance to complete his mission and send him back in time. He arrives at a battlefield of World War I where he is shot in the leg, and then he <b>is</b> <b>suddenly</b> transported to 1996.|$|E
