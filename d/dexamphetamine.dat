40|$|Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} reported symptom in patients with cancer with a prevalence up to 100 %. It has a signifi cant negative impact on quality of life. An effective management of CRF could signifi cantly reduce the disease burden associated with cancer and its treatment. Unfortunately, the underlying pathophysiology is very complex and not uniform. This article reviews the possible therapy of contributing factors, nonpharmacological treatment, such as exercise and psychosocial interventions, and pharmacologic approaches in managing CRF. Numerous drugs, such as psychostimulants (methylphenidate, <b>dexamphetamines,</b> modafi nil and pemoline), antidepressants, corticosteroids, L-carnitine, donepezil and guarana have been studied. Methylphenidate, modafi nil and guarana show the most promising results so far.

50|$|In a {{study on}} slices of rat corpus {{striatum}} and substantia nigra fencamfamin acted as an indirect dopamine agonist. It released dopamine by a similar mechanism to amphetamines, but was ten times less potent than <b>dexamphetamine</b> at producing this effect.

5000|$|Like {{schedule}} 4 substances, {{the price}} of many Schedule substances are subsidized through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), {{some of which may}} require an authority. In addition, in some states, all drugs on schedule 8 require a doctor to have an S8 permit before prescribing treatment. For example, in NSW the prescribing of Schedule 8 CNS stimulant medication (e.g., methylphenidate, <b>dexamphetamine)</b> requires authorisation from the NSW Ministry of Health (Pharmaceutical Services) and is generally restricted to specialists, such as paediatricians and psychiatrists. A GP (General Practitioner) cannot initiate the treatment, although they can prescribe in very limited circumstances, e.g. co-prescribing on behalf of the specialist; and in rural areas, if the patient has been diagnosed with ADHD, a GP may apply for the authority to prescribe. Patients who may require Schedule 8 CNS stimulant medication should be referred to a specialist for assessment.|$|E
50|$|Pemoline is {{generally}} considered dopaminergic, but its precise method of action hasn't yet been definitively determined. Pemoline passes the blood-brain barrier and acts as a surrogate for dopamine, not affecting endogenous intracellular dopamine. For this reason, {{and the fact that}} it has little or no affinity for adrenaline receptors, pemoline has minimal sympathomimetic side effects such as: dry mouth, reduction in appetite, high blood pressure, increased heart rate, constriction of smooth muscle, cardiac stress, dilated pupils and insomnia. There is some data to suggest that pemoline is a nootropic acting as a catalyst conductor in the synapses of the brain's memory centers, raising the efficiency of memory and assisting RNA formation in the brain. While drugs like <b>dexamphetamine</b> and methylphenidate are classified as Schedule II, pemoline is listed as Schedule IV (non-narcotic). In studies conducted on primates, pemoline fails to demonstrate a potential for self-administration.|$|E

50|$|Even though List I {{substances}} are officially {{classified as}} hard drugs, {{several of them}} are often prescribed by licensed doctors. For example, nearly all opioids are List I drugs, but they are commonly prescribed to cancer and HIV patients, as well as sufferers of chronic pain, although prescriptions for opioids are very scarce due to fear of misuse, and they are only prescribed in situations where they are certainly needed, like the terminally ill. Two stimulants which are both prescribed for ADD/ADHD and narcolepsy; <b>dexamphetamine</b> and methylphenidate, are also List I drugs of the Opium Law. On the other hand, all barbiturates except for secobarbital are List II drugs, while none of them, except for phenobarbital, are prescribed today. In theory, a licensed doctor could prescribe any substance they think is needed for the correct treatment of their patient, both List I and List II substances of the Opium Law, though substances which aren't available as commercial pharmaceutical preparations have to be custom prepared by the designated pharmacy.|$|E

Auditory reaction time was decreased by <b>dexamphetamine</b> but unaffected by bupropion and nomifensine. Heart rate was increased after all active treatments but the largest rise followed <b>dexamphetamine</b> 10 mg which differed from both lactose dummy and all other active treatments. Systolic blood pressure was higher after <b>dexamphetamine</b> 10 mg than all other treatments, none of which differed from lactose. No changes occurred in diastolic blood pressure.

40|$|Rationale In party {{circuits}} <b>dexamphetamine</b> {{is frequently}} used {{in combination with}} alcohol. It is hypothesized that co-administration of <b>dexamphetamine</b> to alcohol might reduce the sedative effects of alcohol, but may potentiate risk-taking behaviour. Objectives The study was aimed at assessing the effects of alcohol, <b>dexamphetamine</b> and the combination of both on simulated driving and cognitive performance. Method Eighteen subjects participated in a randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled study employing four conditions: 10 mg <b>dexamphetamine,</b> 0. 8 g/kg alcohol, 10 mg <b>dexamphetamine</b> + 0. 8 g/kg alcohol, and placebo. Fundamental driving skills and risk-taking behaviour were assessed in a driving simulator. Subjects also completed vigilance and divided attention tasks, and subjective ratings. Results Mean BAC levels during simulated driving were between 0. 91 % and 0. 64 %. Subjects using alcohol showed a significantly larger mean standard deviation of lateral position and shorter accepted gap time and distance. Use of alcohol or <b>dexamphetamine</b> + alcohol {{was associated with a}} higher frequency of red light running and collisions than the <b>dexamphetamine</b> or placebo conditions. Performance of vigilance and divided attention tasks was significantly impaired in the alcohol condition and, to a lesser degree, in the <b>dexamphetamine</b> + alcohol condition. Conclusion Single doses of 0. 8 g/kg alcohol increased risktaking behaviours and impaired tracking, attention and reaction time during a 3 -h period after drinking when BACs declined from 0. 9 to 0. 2 mg/ml. The stimulatory effects of co-administration of <b>dexamphetamine</b> 10 mg were not sufficient to overcome the impairing effects of alcohol on skills related to driving. © The Author(s) 2011...|$|E
40|$|Background This article {{explores the}} {{recreational}} use of diverted <b>dexamphetamine,</b> a pharmaceutical stimulant, amongst a social network {{of young adults}} (aged 18 – 31 years) in Perth, Western Australia (WA). Prior epidemiological research indicates that there are high levels of <b>dexamphetamine</b> prescription, and use of diverted <b>dexamphetamine,</b> in this jurisdiction. Little research exists on the social contexts of diverted <b>dexamphetamine</b> use in Australia or overseas. Methods Ethnographic fieldwork was conducted over 18 months amongst a network of approximately 60 young adults who regularly used psychostimulants. Data collection involved participant observation conducted in natural settings including nightclubs and private parties. In-depth interviews were also conducted with 25 key contacts which explored drug use histories and themes emerging from fieldwork. Results The use of diverted <b>dexamphetamine,</b> or ‘dexies’, was prevalent amongst the social network and integrated into local drug practices. The paper explores {{the ways in which}} <b>dexamphetamine</b> use is rationalised, negotiated and represented {{in the context of the}} use of alcohol and other psychostimulants such as methamphetamine and ecstasy. Two key aspects are emphasised. First, <b>dexamphetamine</b> use is seen as insignificant by network members and is positioned as ‘safer’ in relation to the use of other drugs by virtue of its pharmaceutical status. Second, <b>dexamphetamine</b> plays an instrumental role in facilitating the pursuit of ‘controlled pleasure’ via the heavy consumption of alcohol and other drugs. Conclusion The findings of the paper have implications for harm reduction policy. In particular, <b>dexamphetamine</b> use facilitates heavy drinking and polydrug use amongst young adults, which may increase the harms associated with such use. Further, current interventions targeting young psychostimulant users, which emphasise their adulterated and illegal nature, may inadvertently contribute to the cultural construction of <b>dexamphetamine</b> as a relatively ‘safe’ drug...|$|E
40|$|The catecholamines—dopamine and noradrenaline—play {{important}} roles in directing and guiding behavior. Disorders of these systems, particularly within the dopamine system, are associated with several severe and chronically disabling psychiatric and neurological disorders. We used the recently published group independent components analysis (ICA) procedure outlined by Chen et al. (2013) to present the first pharmaco-EEG ICA analysis of the resting-state EEG in healthy participants administered 0. 45 mg/kg <b>dexamphetamine.</b> Twenty-eight healthy participants between 18 and 41 were recruited. Bayesian nested-domain models that explicitly account for spatial and functional relationships were used to contrast placebo and <b>dexamphetamine</b> on component spectral power and several connectivity metrics. <b>Dexamphetamine</b> led to reductions across delta, theta, and alpha spectral power bands that were predominantly localized to Frontal and Central regions. Beta 1 and beta 2 power were reduced by <b>dexamphetamine</b> at Frontal ICs, while beta 2 and gamma power was enhanced by <b>dexamphetamine</b> in posterior regions, including the parietal, occipital-temporal, and occipital regions. Power–power coupling under <b>dexamphetamine</b> was similar for both states, resembling the eyes open condition under placebo. However, orthogonalized measures of power coupling and phase coupling did not show the same effect of <b>dexamphetamine</b> as power-power coupling. We discuss the alterations of low- and high-frequency EEG power in response to <b>dexamphetamine</b> {{within the context of}} disorders of dopamine regulation, in particular schizophrenia, {{as well as in the}} context of a recently hypothesized association between low-frequency power and aspects of anhedonia...|$|E
40|$|Systemic {{administration}} of {{high doses of}} <b>dexamphetamine</b> induces a dopamine efflux that has its intracellular origin in both the vesicular, reserpine-sensitive dopamine pool and the cytosolic, alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine-sensitive, newly synthesized dopamine pool. It remains unknown whether locally administered <b>dexamphetamine</b> produces similar effects. Using a brain microdialysis technique that is combined with a microinjection needle, {{the contribution of the}} vesicular and cytosolic pools to the dopamine efflux induced by striatal injection of <b>dexamphetamine</b> was analyzed in rats. The transient striatal dopamine efflux induced by intrastriatal injection of <b>dexamphetamine</b> (1. 0 microg/ 0. 5 microl) was significantly reduced by systemic {{administration of}} reserpine (5 mg/kg i. p., given 24 h earlier) or alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine (250 mg/kg i. p., given 2 h earlier). The effects of <b>dexamphetamine</b> on the striatal dopamine were nearly nullified by combined treatment with reserpine and alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine. The sum of the amounts of extracellular dopamine that was sensitive to either reserpine or alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine, was far greater than 100 %, namely 146. 1 % of the basal dopamine level and 144. 0 % of the dexamphetamine-induced dopamine level. The present study indicates that both the vesicular dopamine pool and the cytosolic dopamine pool contribute to the transient increase of striatal dopamine efflux induced by intrastriatal injection of <b>dexamphetamine.</b> This study also suggests that striatally applied <b>dexamphetamine</b> can promote the redistribution of rat striatal dopamine from vesicles to the cytosol in vivo...|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} road {{fatalities}} {{related to the}} presence of amphetamines in drivers has been relatively constant over the past 10 years. However, there remains uncertainty as to the extent that these drugs induce driving impairment, and whether any such impairments translate to an increase in road fatalities. This study sought to examine the acute effects of 0. 42 mg/kg <b>dexamphetamine</b> on simulated driving performance, and to establish which, if any, simulated driving abilities become impaired following <b>dexamphetamine</b> administration. A repeated-measures, counter-balanced, double-blind, placebo-controlled design was employed. Twenty healthy volunteers completed two treatment conditions— 0. 42 mg/kg <b>dexamphetamine</b> and placebo. Performance was assessed using a driving simulator task. Blood and saliva samples were obtained prior to the driving tasks and immediately after task completion (120 min and 170 min post-drug administration, respectively). Mean <b>dexamphetamine</b> blood concentrations were 83 ng/ml and 98 ng/ml at 120 min and 170 min, respectively. Results indicated a decrease in overall simulated driving ability following <b>dexamphetamine</b> administration during the day-time but not the night-time scenario tasks. Contributing to this performance reduction, incorrect signalling, failing to stop at a red traffic light and slow reaction times were the behaviours most strongly affected by <b>dexamphetamine.</b> The decrease in simulated driving ability observed during the day-time driving tasks are consistent with the perceptual narrowing or tunnel vision that is associated with <b>dexamphetamine</b> consumption...|$|E

40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the effects of}} <b>dexamphetamine</b> with and without alcohol on simulated driving and cognitive tasks. 18 subjects participated in all 4 conditions: 10 mg <b>dexamphetamine</b> and 0. 8 g/kg alcohol, 10 mg <b>dexamphetamine</b> only, 0. 8 g/kg alcohol only, and a placebo control condition. A driving simulator {{was used to assess}} driving skills and risk taking on different road types. Cognitive performance was assessed using vigilance and divided attention tasks and subjects completed different rating scales. The main effects found were those of alcohol. This related to a larger standard deviation of lateral position, shorter accepted gap time and distance, higher average and maximum driving speeds and more violations of speed limits. A higher percentage of subjects in the <b>dexamphetamine</b> + alcohol condition did not stop for the red traffic lights, or collided with a vehicle. Performance of vigilance and divided attention tasks was impaired in the alcohol condition and impaired to a lesser degree in the <b>dexamphetamine</b> + alcohol condition. The conclusions of this study are that the main effect of impaired driving was found in the effect of 0. 8 g/kg alcohol dose at the control level and the maneuvering level. The amphetamine dose did not potentiate risk taking behaviour, but also did not overcome the negative effects of alcohol. The findings of the present study justify the conclusion that drivers using 0. 8 g/kg alcohol, or the combination of <b>dexamphetamine</b> with alcohol, pose a considerable traffic safety risk...|$|E

Journal {{compilation}} © 2009 Society for the Study of AddictionAIM: To {{investigate the}} safety and efficacy of once-daily supervised oral administration of sustained-release <b>dexamphetamine</b> in people dependent on methamphetamine. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-nine methamphetamine-dependent drug users from Drug and Alcohol Services South Australia (DASSA) clinics. INTERVENTION: Participants were assigned randomly to receive up to 110 mg/day sustained-release <b>dexamphetamine</b> (n = 23) or placebo (n = 26) for a maximum of 12 weeks, with gradual reduction of the study medication over an additional 4 weeks. Medication was taken daily under pharmacist supervision. MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcome measures included treatment retention, measures of methamphetamine consumption (self-report and hair analysis), degree of methamphetamine dependence and severity of methamphetamine withdrawal. Hair samples were analysed for methamphetamine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. FINDINGS: Treatment retention was significantly different between groups, with those who received <b>dexamphetamine</b> remaining in treatment {{for an average of}} 86. 3 days compared with 48. 6 days for those receiving placebo (P = 0. 014). There were significant reductions in self-reported methamphetamine use between baseline and follow-up within each group (P < 0. 0001), with a trend to a greater reduction among the <b>dexamphetamine</b> group (P = 0. 086). Based on hair analysis, there was a significant decrease in methamphetamine concentration for both groups (P < 0. 0001). At follow-up, degree of methamphetamine dependence was significantly lower in the <b>dexamphetamine</b> group (P = 0. 042). <b>Dexamphetamine</b> maintenance was not associated with serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this preliminary study have demonstrated that a maintenance pharmacotherapy programme of daily sustained-release amphetamine dispensing under pharmacist supervision is both feasible and safe. The increased retention in the <b>dexamphetamine</b> group, together with the general decreases in methamphetamine use, degree of dependence and withdrawal symptom severity, provide preliminary evidence that this may be an efficacious treatment option for methamphetamine dependence.

We conducted a pilot study to evaluate whether <b>dexamphetamine</b> can be used safely, combined with diet and exercise, for treating obesity. Our ultimate aim is to develop a 6 -month treatment program for establishing the lifestyle changes necessary for weight control, utilizing <b>dexamphetamine</b> for its psychotropic effect on motivation. We viewed the anorexigenic effect as an additional advantage for promoting initial weight loss. Methods: Obese adults were treated with <b>dexamphetamine</b> for 6 [*]months (maximum of 30 [*]mg twice daily), diet, and exercise. Weight, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and blood pressure were monitored. Results: Twelve out of 14 completed 6 [*]months treatment.

40|$|Daily urinary {{excretion}} of catechol amines {{in normal}} rats and in rats {{from which the}} adrenal medullae had been removed has been determined by a photofluorimetric method. In both groups, reserpine (2 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) produces: (1) A decrease in the urinary excretion of noradrenaline which persists for more than 3 weeks; this action is not influenced by monoamine oxidase inhibitors and mecamylamine. (2) An increase, within 20 to 68 hr, in the urinary excretion of adrenaline, even though the urine of rats without adrenal medullae does not usually contain adrenaline. These effects are prevented by monoamine oxidase inhibitors and, in the normal animals, are reduced by mecamylamine. In both groups, <b>dexamphetamine</b> (6 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) produces {{an increase in the}} excretion of adrenaline and noradrenaline, the adrenaline appearing in the urine of the rats without adrenal medullae within 20 to 44 hr. Mecamylamine prevents the effect of <b>dexamphetamine</b> on the excretion of noradrenaline. <b>Dexamphetamine,</b> administered within a week of reserpine treatment, produces its usual effects on the urinary excretion of catechol amines in normal rats, but has no effect in rats without adrenal medullae. The results are discussed with regard to both the mechanism by which reserpine and <b>dexamphetamine</b> influence the peripheral stores of adrenaline and noradrenaline, and the significance of the adrenal and extra-adrenal chromaffin system...|$|E
40|$|Stimulant {{medications}} are {{the most}} commonly prescribed treatment for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD). These medications result in a normalization of the EEG. However, past {{research has found that}} complete normalization of the EEG is not always achieved. One reason for this may be that studies have used different medications interchangeably, or groups of subjects on different stimulants. This study investigated whether methylphenidate and <b>dexamphetamine</b> produce different levels of normalization of the EEG in children with AD/HD. Three groups of 20 boys participated in this study. There were 2 groups with a diagnosis of AD/HD; one group, good responders to methylphenidate, and the second, good responders to <b>dexamphetamine.</b> The third group was a normal control group. Baseline EEGs were recorded using an eyes-closed resting condition, and analyzed for total power and relative delta, theta, alpha, and beta. Subjects were placed on a 6 -month trial of methylphenidate or <b>dexamphetamine,</b> after which a second EEG was recorded. At baseline, the children with AD/HD had elevated relative theta, less relative alpha and beta compared with controls. Baseline {{differences were found between the}} two medication groups, with the <b>dexamphetamine</b> group having greater EEG abnormalities than the methylphenidate group. The results indicate that good responders to methylphenidate and <b>dexamphetamine</b> have different EEG profiles when assessed before medication, and these differences may represent different underlying central nervous system deficits. The 2 medications were found to result in substantial normalization of the EEG, with no significant differences in EEG changes occurring between the 2 medications. This indicates that the degree of pretreatment EEG abnormality was the major factor contributing to the degree of normalization of the EEG. As good responders to the 2 medications appear to have different central nervous system abnormalities, it is recommended that stimulant medications be treated independently and not used interchangeably in research and treatment of AD/HD...|$|E
40|$|Twenty {{patients}} with the narcoleptic syndrome were treated separately with <b>dexamphetamine</b> sulphate tablets 10 and 30 mg, Dexedrine Spansules 10 mg, mazindol 4 mg, and fencamfamin hydrochloride 60 mg daily. Each drug was given for four weeks and the effects compared. In these dosages the reported frequency of attacks of narcolepsy was roughly halved with each treatment, <b>dexamphetamine</b> 30 mg daily being only slightly more potent than 10 mg. The subjective effects of Dexedrine tablets and Spansules could not be distinguished by most patients. Effects on mood, alertness, and sympathomimetic side effects were largely inseparable with all these drugs, but a decrease in appetite was not reported by {{patients with}} narcolepsy...|$|E
40|$|Modafinil (2 -[(diphenylmethyl) sulfinyl]acetamide, Modavigil®) {{is a novel}} {{stimulant}} medication {{shown to}} improve alertness, cognitive performance and subjective mood. It {{is thought to be}} a superior alternative to amphetamines; with its neuropsychological profile and resulting behavioural effects suggesting it is functionally distinct from conventional stimulants, such as <b>dexamphetamine.</b> The current study investigated acute driving-related cognitive skills and simulated driving performance following a 200 mg single dose of modafinil in well rested individuals, using measures of driving performance that have been demonstrated to be negatively affected by <b>dexamphetamine.</b> Twenty participants completed the double-blinded placebo-controlled crossover study, completing a battery of cognitive tasks (Occupational Safety Performance Assessment Technology, reaction time index, stop signal task, rapid visual information processing) and a simulated driving scenario at baseline and at 3 hours post drug administration (peak drug level). No deleterious effects of modafinil were found, which is in contrast to <b>dexamphetamine</b> use on comparable tasks. Subjective levels of alertness were higher at peak modafinil compared to placebo; modafinil lead to faster stop signal reaction time on the stop signal task; less lateral lane deviation and a trend towards fewer centre line crossings were apparent during simulated driving. The findings of the current study indicated that modafinil selectively improves neuropsychological task performance in a functionally different way compared to conventional stimulants, specifically <b>dexamphetamine.</b> These differences in cognitive and behavioural performance may be attributable to the differing neurochemical profile of these drugs, and demonstrate a reduced risk to road safety for modafinil in comparison to existing stimulant medications...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacological}} properties of a phenothiazine derivative thioproperazine have been {{compared with those}} of chlorpromazine, and the modifications by some anti-Parkinsonian drugs of its actions on the central nervous system have been studied. Thioproperazine was less potent than chlorpromazine in lowering blood pressure and antagonizing adrenaline in the cat, in depressing respiratory rate in the rabbit, in producing hypothermia and analgesia and in reducing the minimum anaesthetic dose of hexobarbitone in mice, and in protecting rats from convulsions induced by tryptamine. It was roughly equipotent to chlorpromazine in reducing locomotor activity of mice. Thioproperazine was more potent than chlorpromazine in protecting grouped mice from the acute toxicity of <b>dexamphetamine,</b> in preventing the acute behavioural disturbances produced by <b>dexamphetamine</b> in the rat, in producing a state of experimental catatonia in the rat and in preventing the emetic action of apomorphine in the dog. Hyoscine, benztropine or promethazine greatly reduced the ability of thioproperazine to prevent behavioural changes due to <b>dexamphetamine</b> in the rat and also abolished symptoms of experimental catatonia produced by thioproperazine. In contrast, the antiapomorphine activity of thioproperazine in the dog was not reduced to any extent by hyoscine or benztropine...|$|E
