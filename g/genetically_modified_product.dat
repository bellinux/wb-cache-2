40|$|The {{development}} of novel foods produced through agricultural biotechnology {{is a complex}} three-stage process: gene discovery, line selection, and product advancement to commercialization. The safety of genetically modified foods {{is an integral part}} of the overall developmental process throughout all of the stages. In the discovery stage, the safety of the gene, its source, and the gene products must be considered. If any questions arise at this stage, these questions must be answered later in the developmental process. During the line selection stage, the genetically modified seed progresses through a variety of greenhouse and field trials. At this stage, the biological and agronomic equivalence of the genetically modified crop to its traditional counterpart must be compared. While the evaluations made during this stage are not specifically directed toward a safety assessment, many potential products with unusual characteristics are eliminated during this stage of development. However, the elimination of products with unusual agronomic or biological characteristics enhances the likelihood that a safe product will be generated. Finally, in the pre-commercialization stage, the <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>product</b> undergoes a detailed safety assessment process. This process focuses on the safety of the gene products associated with the introduced gene and any other likely toxicological or anti-nutrient factors associated with the source of the novel gene and the crop to which it was introduced. The safety of the <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>product</b> for both food and feed uses is considered. Thus far, all of the genetically modified products brought into the marketplace have been subjected to such an intensive safety assessment. The safety assessment data have been reviewed by regulatory authorities around the world. The current generation of genetically modified products are quite safe for human and feed animal consumption...|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{analytical}} framework {{to examine the}} market and welfare impacts of GMOs, when some consumers refuse genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and when two supply channels are segregated (one for goods that containing GMOs and one for non-genetically-modified identity-preserved goods). Our analytical framework begins {{at the level of}} individual farmers, handlers and consumers, to build up market supply and demand functions. This allows us to circumvent the difficulties of conducting supply and demand analysis in the different horizontally and vertically related markets concerned by GMOs and market segregation. We represent explicitly the costs of non-GMO segregation and identity preservation (IP) for both producers of non-GM IP goods and producers of non-IP goods, and how these costs vary depending on the relative sizes of the two production channels. We then illustrate our model by a simulation of potential adoption of GM rapeseed with non-GMO market segregation in the European Union (EU).

40|$|Both {{labelling}} and traceability {{of genetically}} modified organisms are current issues that are considered in trade and regulation. Currently, labelling {{of genetically modified}} foods containing detectable transgenic material is required by EU legislation. A proposed package of legislation would extend this labelling to foods without any traces of transgenics. These new legislations would also impose labelling and a traceability system based on documentation throughout the food and feed manufacture system. The regulatory issues of risk analysis and labelling are currently harmonised by Codex Alimentarius. The implementation and maintenance of the regulations necessitates sampling protocols and analytical methodologies that allow for accurate {{determination of the content}} of genetically modified organisms within a food and feed sample. Current methodologies for the analysis of genetically modified organisms are focused on either one of two targets, the transgenic DNA inserted- or the novel protein(s) expressed- in a <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>product.</b> For most DNA-based detection methods, the polymerase chain reaction is employed. Items that need consideration in the use of DNA-based detection methods include the specificity, sensitivity, matrix effects, internal reference DNA, availability of external reference materials, hemizygosity versus homozygosity, extrachromosomal DNA, and international harmonisation. For most protein-based methods, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with antibodies binding the novel protein are employed. Consideration should be given to the selection of the antigen bound by the antibody, accuracy, validation, and matrix effects. Currently, validation of detection methods for analysis of genetically modified organisms is taking place. In addition, new methodologies are developed, including the use of microarrays, mass spectrometry, and surface plasmon resonance. Challenges for GMO detection include the detection of transgenic material in materials with varying chromosome numbers. The existing and proposed regulatory EU requirements for traceability of genetically modified products fit within a broader tendency towards traceability of foods in general and, commercially, towards products that can be distinguished from each other. Traceability systems document the history of a product and may serve the purpose of both marketing and health protection. In this framework, segregation and identity preservation systems allow for the separation of genetically modified and non-modified products from "farm to fork". Implementation of these systems comes with specific technical requirements for each particular step of the food processing chain. In addition, the feasibility of traceability systems depends on a number of factors, including unique identifiers for each <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>product,</b> detection methods, permissible levels of contamination, and financial costs. In conclusion, progress has been achieved in the field of sampling, detection, and traceability of genetically modified products, while some issues remain to be solved.

The definition of international approaches to risk assessment of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>products</b> is of particular importance for international trade. Methodology. The study is based on data from different sources, beginning with the first mention of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> organisms, ending with the latest received data from different countries. Purpose. Show how different countries refer differently to the production of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>products,</b> differently perceive it and are guided by different principles. Find ways to solve the problems associated with the introduction of GMOs in Ukraine and compare them with other countries. Results. The study showed that developed countries have developed clear rules for the production, labelling, consumption, and trade of products containing GMOs. Also, the bodies and structures responsible for compliance with all these rules are defined and a large number of legislative acts has been adopted, which cannot be said of Ukraine. In Ukraine, this is a large gap because “on paper” also seems that there are some rules according to GMOs but they are not clear, consistent, and they are not followed due to their observance, as these powers are entrusted to a large number of structures. Due to imperfect legislation and lack of funds, products that are imported are not tested for GMOs content, there are no studies on the safety of their consumption and cultivation, the reliability of information on labels is not followed. Practical implications. In Ukraine, in order to ensure the proper level of state regulation, protection, and use of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>products</b> obtained with the help of modern biotechnologies, it is necessary to adhere strictly to the fulfilment of the main criteria: 1) adoption and further improvement of legislation regulating this area of activity; 2) registration and prevention of the danger of genetic pollution of the environment as a result of the production of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> products; 3) determination of economic efficiency from growing GM plants; 4) introduction of a transparent GMO registration system and issuing permits for field testing of transgenic plants, limiting plant testing to several years; 5) solution of a problem of intellectual property protection in this area and technology transfer; 6) determining the degree of influence of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>products</b> on human health and the biosystem as a whole; 7) formation of public opinion, development of environmental education; 8) enhancement of international cooperation in plant biotechnology and biosafety. Value/originality.

40|$|The pre-market safety {{assessment}} of foods derived from {{genetically modified crops}} is carried out according to the consensus approach of "substantial equivalence", in other words: the comparative {{safety assessment}}. Currently, the safety assessment of genetically modified foods is harmonized at the international level. The starting point of the assessment is the comparison of a <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>product</b> with an appropriate counterpart. Based upon the differences thus identified, it is decided what further information is needed. Recent developments pertaining to {{the issues that are}} commonly assessed are discussed, including compositional analysis, allergenicity, toxicity, gene transfer, and unintended effects. The International Life Sciences Institute, for example, has compiled a database with compositional background data from field-tested crops. Prediction of allergenicity by bioinformatic methods {{has been the subject of}} some studies, which sought to refine the current methodologies. Based on in vitro and in vivo studies, the UK Food Standards Agency concluded that there was an extremely low risk of gene transfer from biotech crops during digestion. With regard to toxicity testing, the applicability of biomarkers to animal models is currently investigated. To screen for unintended effects, holistic profiling techniques are developed that can supplement current targeted analytical methodologies. While it is recognized that the current approach has been sufficient to assess the current generation of biotech crops, the assessment of future crops with more complicated modifications may necessitate the use of additional tools. To this end, enabling methodologies are developed within EU research projects that are brought together in the ENTRANSFOOD thematic network...|$|E

Such organisms have been called genetically modified organisms. The first genetically modified varieties of cultivated plants entered the market in 1996 and since then areas sown with such crops has been increasing, amounting to 60 M ha in 2002. During the stated period, genetically modified varieties and hybrids of cultivated plants were developed with a gene introduced for tolerance to herbicides, resistance to insects, prolonged maturity period and improved quality. However, heavy disputes have arisen {{all over the world}} relating the possible gain and potential risks from the growth and utilization of modified crops. First of all, there are ethical issues related directly to gene transfer from a species to a species, then effects of the introduced gene on the environment and human health, economical justification of cultivating genetically modified crops, consumers confidence in the legislation, labeling the products encompassing a genetic modification, effects on the global market and ever increasing food requirements. The effect of products derived from genetically modified plants on human health depends on a specific content of a product itself and can potentially be useful if a product contains an increased content of vitamins, with an allergen removed, or potentially harmful, if a new allergen or a toxin were introduced by genetic modifications. Each <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>product</b> is subjected to a rigorous testing of its safety prior to its introduction into a food chain.

The impact of information strategy (balanced, or product specific), attributed information source (The “European Association of Consumers”, the “European Association of Industry” or the “European Commission”) and type of product (yoghurt or beer) were systematically examined in the four European countries involved in the research. The effects of a classical advertising approach were also examined in Denmark and Germany. The results indicated that • Providing information does not increase acceptance of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> foods. The reverse was found to be true. • In all countries, consumers tended to select non-genetically <b>modified</b> <b>products.</b> Cross-national differences related to type of product were not very pronounced. • Those respondents who had positive prior attitudes towards <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> foods were more likely to select <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> foods. These attitudes were not influenced by information provision. • The form of information strategy about <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> foods was not important. However, the provision of information (in itself) was more likely to activate existing attitudes already held by respondents than change these attitudes. • Labelling of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>products</b> alone was unlikely to result in attitude activation. • These results are likely to be applicable only in cultures in which attitudes towards <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> foods are already well established. Information may have a different impact in countries in which the public have not been exposed to information about <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> foods. • Information source characteristics do influence consumer choices regarding <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> foods.
