50|$|The Dock Tower in Grimsby, North East Lincolnshire, UK {{was built}} in 1852 and stands 94 m tall. Its {{function}} was as an <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tower</b> to open the lock gates of the Royal Dock. Although obsolete from 1892 onward, the tower remains as a proud monument to the town and its rich fishing history.|$|E
50|$|Jesse Hartley, who was {{responsible}} for many of Liverpool's maritime structures - including the Albert Dock, designed the Central <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>Tower</b> and Engine House (the tower is an accumulator tower). Providing power for the movement of lock gates and bridges at Birkenhead Docks, it was completed in 1863. The design of the building was based on the Palazzo Vecchio in the Piazza Della Signoria, Florence, Italy.|$|E

5000|$|Bramley-Moore Dock is the {{location}} of one of Liverpool's brick-built <b>hydraulic</b> accumulator <b>towers.</b> [...] The <b>tower</b> provided <b>hydraulic</b> power to dock gates and lifting equipment.|$|R
5000|$|Bramley-Moore Dock lays in {{the buffer}} {{zone of the}} Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City World Heritage Site. The docks {{is also in the}} planned Liverpool Waters. The docks has Grade II listed {{buildings}} such as the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tower,</b> dock retaining walls & gate towers. [...] Bramley Moore is an active commercial dock with one original transit shed from 1848 still in use. Two of the quays are for the unloading of aggregates and one quay for the transit shed and berthing of the port's Svitzer tugs.|$|E
5000|$|Moving {{equipment}} for the dock gates was supplied by W. Armstrong. The hydraulic power supply for the equipment was a 200 ft high water tower (Grimsby Dock tower), charged by a [...] horizontal engine. The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tower</b> {{was built on the}} centre pier between the two locks, of plain brick, 28 ft square at the base. Its water tank was located at 200 ft and contained 33000 imp gal. The tower's architectural design was by J.W. Wild and was inspired by Italian buildings, in particular the town hall of Siena (Torre del Mangia in the Palazzo Pubblico).|$|E
50|$|Twelve Quays {{is named}} from the quaysides which served the {{adjoining}} Morpeth Dock, Egerton Dock, Alfred Dock, Wallasey Dock and East Float, {{as well as}} quaysides on the River Mersey. Wallasey Dock was infilled in 2001, to expand the land area of the site. The area was an artificial island, until the infilling of the Morpeth Dock entrance. Twelve Quays includes the former Wallasey Dock Impounding Station, and the Central <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>Tower.</b> Several bridges connect Twelve Quays to Birkenhead and Seacombe, two of these being along Tower Road and one {{at the entrance to}} Egerton Dock. Another of the bridges along Tower Road was removed, when the East Float entrance to Egerton Dock was infilled.|$|E
5000|$|The Dock Tower {{continued}} to provide water for hydraulic working until 1892 when the erection of the <b>hydraulic</b> accumulator <b>tower</b> {{on the opposite}} pier approximately 200 ft to the North West of the Dock Tower took over - water in this structure was pressurised by a 300-tonne weight. Present dock and lock machinery are powered by electric or electro-hydraulic energy.|$|R
50|$|Grimsby Dock <b>Tower</b> is a <b>hydraulic</b> {{accumulator}} <b>tower</b> and a maritime landmark at {{the entrance}} to the Royal Dock, Grimsby, in North East Lincolnshire, England. It was completed on 27 March 1852 with the purpose of containing a 30000 imp gal reservoir at a height of 200 ft, that was used to provide hydraulic power to power the machinery of the Grimsby Docks. The extreme height of the tower was necessary to achieve sufficient pressure, and as a result of this, the tower can be seen for several miles around, even far inland on the north bank of the River Humber in villages such as Patrington.|$|R
50|$|The first {{electric}} train passenger service {{ran through the}} station on 3 May 1903, with a 650v DC fourth rail system and Mersey Railway electric units built by Westinghouse. Despite the journey being far quicker than travel aboard the Mersey Ferry service, passengers were not keen on travelling underground due to {{the smoke from the}} previous coal-powered steam locomotives. A Frequent {{electric train}}s sign was erected {{on the outside of the}} station's large <b>hydraulic</b> lift <b>tower</b> (slightly below the position of the present sign) to publicise these cleaner trains. The booking hall had a central ticket office, as was popular on the London Underground.|$|R
50|$|The {{work was}} carried out {{under the command of}} German Enrique Schöndube, {{although}} it is known that payment for the construction took ten years due {{to the start of the}} Mexican Revolution, so it was paid once the new government established. During the Mexican Revolution, Villas officers thought the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tower</b> had such a large amount of water that destroying it would drown the population of Celaya. One of Villas generals ordered his artillery to destroy it. Captain Gustavo Duron, in charge of a 75mm battery, followed the orders but shot around the tower, avoiding it and protecting the monument, as mentioned by local historian Herminio Martínez. The construction resulted in the neglect of the people handing out water at home from the mayors office called water carriers. Commercial advertising on its surface was allowed for several years to cover the costs of the reservoir, ending on September 8, 1980 when, in celebration of upcoming 410th Anniversary of the Foundation of Celaya, the mayor in charge decreed that the Ball of Water would be a symbol that would represent the city, and the placement of advertisements was banned.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2017, two {{separate}} planning applications were submitted to demolish the Lord Line {{building and the}} nearby <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tower</b> and pump house, which once provided power for the entire dock. The pump house is a Grade II listed building but has also suffered extensive vandalism in recent years. The Lord Line is not nationally listed but has been locally listed by Hull City Council for its historic importance and both lie in an official conservation area covering the old dock. Manor stated in their application: [...] "It has been vacant {{for a number of}} years and has, notwithstanding various security measures, been the subject of numerous break-ins, fires and trespass in recent years to the extent that it is now considered dangerous to public health and safety. Further boarding up will not be effective in addressing this issue and the only realistic solution to this current state of affairs is its demolition. It is proposed to completely demolish the Lord Line Building and make good the cleared site. Planning permission is not being sought for any replacement building." [...] The Victorian Society described the proposed demolition of the listed pump house as a mockery of Hull’s maritime heritage and condemned the ‘gross insensitivity’ of the scheme, adding that St. Andrew’s Dock is central to the identity of a city that is largely defined by its maritime heritage.The substantial loss of this listed building would strike at the very heart of this identity and would make a mockery of the ongoing cultural celebrations. As of July 2017, no redevelopment proposals had been put forward by the company regarding the site.|$|E
50|$|For the 1900 Exposition Universelle, {{the lifts}} {{in the east}} and west legs were {{replaced}} by lifts running as far as the second level constructed by the French firm Fives-Lille. These had a compensating mechanism to keep the floor level as the angle of ascent changed at the first level, and were driven by a similar hydraulic mechanism to the Otis lifts, although this was situated {{at the base of the}} <b>tower.</b> <b>Hydraulic</b> pressure was provided by pressurised accumulators located near this mechanism. At the same time the lift in the north pillar was removed and replaced by a staircase to the first level. The layout of both first and second levels was modified, with the space available for visitors on the second level. The original lift in the south pillar was removed 13 years later.|$|R
2500|$|Throughout {{the summer}} of 1950, as many as 200 men were {{involved}} in the final steps of completion of the 1950 Tacoma Narrows Bridge. [...] On July 24, workers from Roebling's Sons were involved in wrapping and caulking the suspender cable bands, and the railings on the sidewalks were being completed. By August 22, the road deck was taking shape, as workers continued concrete pours for the roadway. Painting began that week, as eleven men worked the paint crew sandblasting and painting the stiffening truss. The bridge received its first coat of [...] "Narrows Green" [...] paint - a grayish-green hue (its predecessor had been painted the same color a decade before). By September 30, workers installed the finishing touches on the toll plazas, including installing sheetrock and plumbing. The midspan and <b>tower</b> <b>hydraulic</b> damping mechanisms were also installed, and workers began removing the catwalks, tower buttresses, and other working platforms.|$|R
500|$|All six WindSeekers {{consist of}} the same parts in an {{identical}} structure. The [...] center tower {{is made up of}} eight parts. The base section is different from the other seven tower pieces because it supports the rest of the tower. On top of the eighth tower piece, there is a steel platform where workers and mechanics can observe the operation of the ride and perform maintenance. Above this platform is an element called the [...] "red UFO" [...] or the [...] "Crown". The gondola itself has a number of parts. In the middle of the structure there are wheels that allow the swings to rotate as they go up and down the tower. The gondola is raised and lowered by cables linking the gondola structure to four sets of yellow wheels, each attached to a different section of the steel platform {{at the top of the}} <b>tower.</b> <b>Hydraulic</b> dampers that were not in the original design were added to all the WindSeeker installations to reduce the movement of the swings while in operation. The illustrations below show where the parts are located and what they look like.|$|R
50|$|On 4 January 1944, the Panzerkomission {{approved}} of the PzKpfw III/IV, {{with a combination of}} the PzKpfw III and PzKpfw IV chassis. The Maybach HL-120TRM, having been successful during the ongoing Second World War, was selected as the engine for this new project, and was connected to the SSG-77 transmission. The most striking change was the use of a box drive with large wheels, with a <b>hydraulic</b> pivoting device <b>tower.</b> The vehicle was designed to be equipped with 50mm armour all-round, with 60mm thick armor plates on the front part of the body having a 60 degree vertical inclination on the top and 45 degrees vertical inclination at the bottom. Driving wheels of the PzKpfw III were used with the addition of reinforced output shafts, along with 540mm wide symmetrical tracks with a central ridge. The chassis had six semi-detached rollers 660mm in diameter on the leaf springs. The turret used was a modified variant of the PzKpfw IV Ausf. J, and used flexible electrical cable instead of using rotary electrical contacts at the base. The traverse angle of the turret was limited to 270 left and right longitudinally.|$|R
