In response to questions by The Times about his 1973 statement, Huhne responded: [...] "To be honest I don't have any memory of it", saying that he was entitled to a private life before politics. In an interview published on the Kent News website on 10 November 2007, Huhne said: [...] "I clearly regret the views and I don't agree with those views at all. I was a teenager and I'm now 53 and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> us do tend to move on in life." ...|$|E

No one knows when Fidel Castro will move on. In my judgment, that's the work of the Almighty." [...] On August 2, Senator Robert Bennett (R-Utah) said President Bush told him the administration was surprised by the announcement of Castro's illness, [...] "The president's comment was that everybody was caught by surprise, and we'll {{have to wait and see}} what U.S. action is necessary. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> us can say we had no idea this was coming." ...|$|E

2500|$|In December 2009, Carter said {{he could}} not [...] "ensure" [...] another movie would be made, but thought the {{international}} box office for the 2008 film made it at least a theoretical possibility. In an interview published in August 2012, Spotnitz said he was talking up the idea of an X-Files movie every chance he got, but that there was still nothing happening on that front, and that time was running very short for a third movie concluding the original X-Files franchise to be made at all. [...] He blamed the poor performance of the 2008 film on {{the fact that it was}} not about aliens. Speaking at San Diego Comic-Con International in July 2013, Carter, when asked about a third film, was extremely non-committal, indicating there was still no forward movement, and saying, [...] "We can get to it later." [...] On August 2013, Carter said, in an interview with Empire, that [...] "It's really up to 20th Century Fox, whether they have the will to do it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> us are interested in putting the band back together", adding that a third installment would be a return to the mythology and that the colonisation date of the television series would not be ignored.|$|E
