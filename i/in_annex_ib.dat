40|$|<b>Annex</b> <b>IB</b> of the EU Regulation on {{organic farming}} (2092 / 91) sets out that animals on organic farms should be fed with feed stuffs from organic farming systems. Only if organic feed is not {{available}} in sufficient quantity and quality, can a set percentage of those non-organic components be used that are listed <b>in</b> <b>Annex</b> II. The derogations for using conventional feed are due to expire in August 2005 and currently negotiations in Brussels are concerned with what rules will apply after August. Several Organisation of the organic sector have already taken significant steps to reduce the reliance on conventional feed for ruminants. In Denmark, all organic cattle have to be fed 100 % organic diets, and BIOLAND and DEMETER in Germany have also included this in their standards. Other producer organisations (for example BIO SUISSE and NATURLAND) have reduced the number conventional components that are still permitted. In France, the percentage of permitted conventional {{has been reduced to}} 10 % for all categories of animals, including pigs and poultry. However, concerns have been expressed that this might lead to a high reliance of imported feed stuff (mainly Soya) in organic rations...|$|R
40|$|This {{publication}} is the update, after {{few years}} of operation of the European Commission Special Publication I. 03. 116. It reports the interoperability test procedure developed for digital tachograph equipment as defined in Council Regulation No. 3821 / 85 amended by Commission Regulation 1360 / 2002 of 13 June 2002 [1] (referred to hereinafter as the Regulation). Interoperability certification {{is one of three}} certifications required for type approval of digital tachograph equipment. The other two certifications concern functional testing, and security evaluation. The type approval process, including an exceptional procedure for the first type approvals, is contained in the Regulation (see Chapter VIII, <b>Annex</b> <b>I(B)).</b> For convenience, the text of Chapter VIII is reproduced in Chapter 11 of this document.

40|$|The Panel on Plant Health {{conducted}} a pest risk assessment for Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) including {{the identification and}} evaluation of risk reduction options. The plants for planting pathway is considered {{the most important one}} and rated as likely, with medium uncertainty. TSWV, reported in many Member States, has one of the widest host range for plant viruses and has three widely distributed thrips vector species in the risk assessment area. For countries falling under the provisions of 2000 / 29 /EC Annex IIAII legislation, the probability of establishment is rated as very likely, with low uncertainty. For Finland and Sweden, protected zone under the 2000 / 29 /EC <b>Annex</b> <b>IB</b> legislation, the probability of establishment is rated unlikely to moderately likely. Spread can occur through the activity of thrips vectors and through trade of infected hosts. The probability of spread in Member States under Annex IIAII provisions is evaluated as likely, with low uncertainty. In Finland and Sweden, spread is rated as unlikely to moderately likely, with medium uncertainty. Since TSWV may cause both yield and quality losses {{in a wide range of}} hosts, a major impact is predictable in the absence of appropriate control measures, with medium uncertainty. The risk reduction options evaluated by the Panel are those addressing either the sanitary status of the propagation material (including the provisions of 2000 / 29 /EC Annex IIAII and <b>Annex</b> <b>IB,</b> statutory certification system and the use of voluntary industry standards) or those addressing the control of TSWV epidemic development through actions directed at the virus or at its vectors (including cultural methods to reduce crop infestation and chemical or biological control of thrips vectors). Limitations of the current measures and the potential consequences of repealing the current legislation are discussed...|$|R
