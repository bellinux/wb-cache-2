5|$|After {{finding out}} that Arizona cheated on her with Lauren, Callie kicks Arizona out of their apartment. They also let out their true {{feelings}} about the accident and more is revealed about how they actually have felt. Callie initially agrees to couples therapy, but she {{shows up at the}} office only to tell Arizona that she isn't going in. Arizona gets drunk with April for a laugh while Callie, who is at the fundraiser, tells people that Arizona died in the plane crash. Arizona is led to believe that she and Leah slept together, however all they did was dance and make grilled cheese sandwiches after watching Derek perform surgery on film. Arizona pursues a sexual relationship with Leah but cuts ties with her when Callie asks her to come back home. It is revealed that Arizona became pregnant via a sperm donor prior to sleeping with Lauren. They decided to try again for a second child, but after agreeing that Callie would carry it, Callie went to see an OB/GYN and discovered that she had developed adhesions in her uterus since Sofia's birth, meaning she can't carry any more children. When she told Arizona, Arizona offered to carry the baby, but Callie decided that since they're still on unsteady footing that <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>goes</b> <b>wrong,</b> they won't make it and she doesn't want to put them in that position. They agree to postpone their plans to have another baby. However, in the season finale of Season 10 it is implied that Callie and Arizona's dream of having other child may come by means of a surrogate. At the beginning of Season 11, Callie and Arizona decide to have a baby by surrogate and Arizona applies for a fetal surgery fellowship with Dr. Herman. Arizona, with a heavy workload because of the fellowship, and Callie have an argument in the waiting room, and they choose to go to therapy together, resulting in a 30-day break. Arizona believes that the break strengthened their relationship and made her realize that she needs Callie - Callie on the other hand declares that the break gave her a taste of the freedom that she has been missing. Callie walks away and the two get a divorce later.|$|E
25|$|Standard cost {{accounting}} can hurt managers, workers, and firms in several ways. For example, a policy decision to increase inventory can harm a manufacturing manager's performance evaluation. Increasing inventory requires increased production, {{which means that}} processes must operate at higher rates. When (not <b>if)</b> <b>something</b> <b>goes</b> <b>wrong,</b> the process takes longer and uses more than the standard labor time. The manager appears responsible for the excess, even though s/he has no control over the production requirement or the problem.|$|E

Recreational solo diving, once discouraged by most training agencies, has been accepted since the late 1990s by some training agencies for experienced divers who have skills in self-sufficiency and redundant backup equipment, and by experienced divers as a personal choice and assumption of responsibility for their own safety.|$|E

We shouldn't prosecute them or their bosses if they decide to put {{their lives on the}} line for the public." [...] In addition, on 26 November 2007 in The Independent Paddick was asked if Commissioner Ian Blair should have resigned over the de Menezes case. His response was: [...] "Yes. The public allows the police to use force on the understanding that someone will be held to account <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>goes</b> <b>wrong.</b> An innocent man was killed by the police and in the absence of any individual officer being held to account, the person at the top should take responsibility." ...|$|E

Kivelson, witchcraft accusations were normally thrown at lower-class peasants, townspeople and Cossacks. People turned to witchcraft {{as a means}} to support themselves. The ratio of male to female accusations was 75% to 25%. Males were targeted more, because witchcraft was associated with societal deviation. Because single people with no settled home could not be taxed, males typically had more power than women in their dissent.|$|R
2500|$|ABC {{required}} Wallenda to wear {{a safety}} harness for the walk. After {{the decision was made}} in mid-May, a spokesperson for ABC explained: [...] "We had always made clear from the beginning that significant safety precautions would need to be taken. This is the outcome of that." [...] Wallenda was not happy about the decision, stating [...] "It's disheartening—I wanted to do it without anything." [...] The Niagara Parks Commission indicated it was unaware of such a requirement when they were considering approval. [...] During the walk, Wallenda told his dad that he felt [...] "like a jackass" [...] wearing the harness. Many observers predicted he would remove the harness partway through the walk, but ultimately he did not do so. Before the crossing, Wallenda had promised that he only would remove the harness if it became a hazard during the walk. [...] "When I first found out about it, {{there was no doubt in}} my mind I was going to take it off", he later said. [...] "But as [...] got closer and closer, I realized I had to honor my word. I've always said I'm a man of integrity." [...] He also acknowledged that removing the harness would have created contractual problems with ABC. [...] "The way a TV network works, <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>goes</b> <b>wrong,</b> they fire people," [...] he said. [...] "If I would have dropped that tether, four people would have been fired because I'm too selfish to care or because it's all about me." [...] In addition to the harness, Wallenda wore a waterproof track suit and shoes custom made by his mother for the walk. Part moccasin, part ballet shoe, the shoes were designed to get a good grip when wet.|$|E

Bar loaders are like magazines for part blanks (or pallets for milling work) in that they allow lights-out machining. The bar loader is filled with bars (or the magazine or pallet with part blanks) during working hours, and then it runs during the night unattended. Given that there is no human around to detect <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>went</b> <b>wrong</b> and the machine should stop, there are various kinds of sensors that are used to detect this, such as load meters, infrared beams, and, in recent years, webcams, which are placed inside the machine tool's enclosure and allow remote viewing of the cutting action.|$|R

5000|$|... 1st extension, in {{operation}} - Construction started in August 2006 on a four billion baht, 5.25 km extension from On Nut (E9) to Bearing. The extension {{was funded by}} the BMA. The original scheduled opening date was mid-2009. However, a delay in tendering of the contract for the electrical and signals resulted in a two-year delay.

5000|$|Beyond this guideline, {{the next}} most common rule is a minimum cash {{injection}} requirement. Even if, for example, a business {{might be able to}} afford a monthly payment of a loan high enough to pay for the entire construction project, many lenders would require them to instead use a certain minimum portion of their own cash to complete the project. The reason for this is both to psychologically and economically tie in the owner with the project (hopefully making it less likely that they would walk away from the project <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>goes</b> <b>wrong),</b> and to give the lender a cushion whereby <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>goes</b> <b>wrong</b> {{they are more likely to}} be able to sell the real estate at a value that would better cover the loan amount.

Walking through minefields, deactivating unexploded bombs or clearing out hostile buildings, for example, {{are some of the most}} dangerous tasks a person is asked to perform in the line of duty. What if we could send robots to do these jobs instead of humans? Then, <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>went</b> <b>wrong,</b> we'd only lose the money it cost to build the robot instead of losing a human life. And we could always build more robots. Today's modern military forces are using different kinds of robots for different applications ranging from mine detection, surveillance, logistics and rescue operations. In the future they will be used for reconnaissance and surveillance, logistics and support, communications infrastructure, forward-deployed offensive operations, and as tactical decoys to conceal maneuver by manned assets. In order to make robots for the unpredicted cluttered environment of the battlefield, research on different aspects of robots is under investigation in laboratories to be able to do its job autonomously, as efficiently as a human operated machine can do.
