25|$|The Nantucketer, {{he alone}} resides and riots on the sea; he alone, in Bible language, {{goes down to}} it in ships; to and fro {{ploughing}} it as his own special plantation. There is his home; there lies his buisiness, which a Noah's flood would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China. He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years he knows not the land; {{so that when he}} comes to it at last, <b>it</b> <b>smells</b> like another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman. With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.|$|E
25|$|If {{rainwater}} is {{used for}} drinking, it is often filtered first. Filtration (such as reverse osmosis, ultraviolet sterilization, or ultrafiltration) may remove pathogens. While rain water is pure it may become contaminated during collection or by collection of particulate matter {{in the air as}} it falls. While rain water does not contain chlorine, contamination from airborne pollutants, which settles onto rooftops, may be a risk in urban or industrial areas. Many water suppliers and health authorities, such as the New South Wales Department of Health, do not advise using rainwater for drinking when there is an alternative mains water supply available. However, reports of illness associated with rainwater tanks are relatively infrequent, and public health studies in South Australia (the Australian state with the highest rainwater usage rate) have not identified a correlation. Rainwater is generally considered fit to drink if <b>it</b> <b>smells,</b> tastes and looks fine; However some pathogens, chemical contamination and sub-micrometre suspended metal may produce neither smell, taste and not be visible.|$|E
25|$|Amortentia {{is a love}} potion {{that does}} not create actual love, but gives the drinker a {{powerful}} obsession and infatuation with the giver of the potion. It is usually either forced upon someone or covertly given. As {{a rule of thumb}} the longer a love potion awaits consumption, the stronger the effects will be, as seen in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince when Ron Weasley mistakenly eats a box of Chocolate Cauldrons spiked with the intense love potion intended for Harry previously bought from Weasley's Wizard Wheezes. The potion's aroma is unique to each person who consumes it, as <b>it</b> <b>smells</b> like whatever attracts each individual, e.g. Hermione Granger says that she smells spearmint toothpaste, freshly cut grass and a piece of fresh parchment in the movies. In the books, she does not say spearmint toothpaste as the third aroma but instead blushes. (she smelled Ron's hair according to later clarification by the author). It can also be identified by its characteristic spirals of steam and its mother-of-pearl sheen, as noted by Hermione. Unless constantly administered, its effects eventually wear off.|$|E

500|$|The {{related species}} Spongiforma thailandica, newly {{described}} in 2009, differs from S.squarepantsii in several ways: it has larger fruit bodies, [...] wide by [...] tall; its gleba is initially pale greyish-orange to brownish-grey before darkening to reddish-brown or dark brown; and <b>it</b> <b>smells</b> of coal tar. Microscopically, S.thailandica has spores with less prominent surface warts.|$|E
500|$|While the album's predecessor, Use Your Fingers, {{was written}} and {{recorded}} {{in a more}} hip hop-oriented style, featuring distinct rap beats, One Fierce Beer Coaster featured a more alternative-oriented sound. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described The Bloodhound Gang's sound as, [...] "smarmy, smirky alternative funk-metal, complete with junk culture references and [...] "ironic" [...] musical allusions." [...] Former Bloodhound Gang guitarist Lupus Thunder credits Weezer as an inspiration for [...] "Fire Water Burn" [...] and Lemonade and Brownies-era Sugar Ray for [...] "Kiss Me Where <b>It</b> <b>Smells</b> Funny." ...|$|E
500|$|Mycena cinerella, {{commonly}} known as the mealy bonnet, is an inedible species of mushroom in the family Mycenaceae. It is found in Europe and the United States, where it grows in groups on fallen leaves and needles under pine and Douglas fir. The small grayish mushrooms have caps that are up to [...] wide atop stipes that are [...] long and [...] thick. Its gills are grayish-white and adnate, with a [...] "tooth" [...] that runs slightly down the stipe. The fungus has both two- and four-spored basidia. As its common name suggests, <b>it</b> <b>smells</b> mealy.|$|E

500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} A.ravenelii are {{distinguished}} from A.chlorinosma {{by the presence}} of pale yellow to brownish orange, large, conical to truncate-conical warts on the cap surface and a large basal bulb. The mushroom A.polypyramis is pure white, and lacks the pale yellow to brownish-orange large conical warts typical of A.ravenelii. The North American species A.armillariiformis has a similar [...] cap surface, but unlike A.ravenelii, does not have a distinct basal bulb, and it is found in semi-arid areas associated with aspen and old growth Douglas fir. Also from North America, A.mutabilis has pink tones on the cap and stem, and will turn pink when its flesh is cut; <b>it</b> <b>smells</b> of anise.|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Levine {{collaborated with}} ID Perfumes {{to create his}} debut eponymous scent. The line was {{launched}} at the Premiere Fragrance Installation in Los Angeles in February 2013. The fragrance range, consisting of scents for both for men and women, is sold through Macy's department stores in microphone-shaped bottles. Speaking at its launch, Levine said: [...] "The task was to make something that I would wear. So that was a process and we finally came to a great conclusion and <b>it</b> <b>smells</b> great" [...] The fragrance garnered media attention for contradicting his tweet the previous year, {{in which he said}} that he wanted to [...] "put an official ban on celebrity fragrances. Punishable by death from this point forward".|$|E
500|$|The stem is [...] long, [...] thick, {{nearly equal}} in width {{throughout}} or enlarged downward, hollow at maturity, sticky to dry, scrobiculate (coarsely pitted), pale yellow to orange-yellow, and stains dull lilac to purple. The flesh is firm, brittle, white, and will stain dull lilac to purple when cut. The odor is sometimes faintly fragrant or not distinctive, {{but when the}} mushroom is dry <b>it</b> <b>smells</b> intensely of soap. Its taste is mild to slightly [...] or somewhat bitter, and the flavor {{has been compared to}} sweet flag (Acorus calamus). The abundant amount of latex produced by the mushroom is white to cream, unchanging, staining all tissues dull lilac to purple. It tastes mild to slightly acrid or somewhat bitter. The spore print is yellowish. The fruit bodies are poisonous and consumption will cause stomach aches, but the nature of the toxic agents has not been identified.|$|E

500|$|The lyrics for One Fierce Beer Coaster utilize {{over-the-top}} satire {{and toilet}} humor to provide comedy. For instance the album opener, [...] "Kiss Me Where <b>It</b> <b>Smells</b> Funny", {{is a song}} about {{a man and his}} new girlfriend and their adventures in cunnilingus. It was written by Jimmy Pop about his then-girlfriend; the two subsequent albums would each have one song about said girlfriend - [...] "Three Point One Four" [...] and [...] "No Hard Feelings," [...] respectively. [...] "Lift Your Head Up High (And Blow Your Brains Out)" [...] is a satirical call for people who have considered suicide to go through with the act, because their life is worthless. Three minutes into the song, Jimmy Pop says [...] "Rewind and let me reverse it backwards like Judas Priest first did." [...] Immediately after this, a four-second segment of backwards vocals repeats four times. When played in reverse, this segment says, [...] "Devil shall wake up and eat Chef Boyardee Beefaroni." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. The Indiana Daily Students Brian Welk called the episode [...] "fairly enjoyable," [...] joking that his Facebook status {{would say that}} he [...] "hopes the 200th episode [...] {{is as good as}} the Facebook one!" [...] Tucker of Entertainment Weekly said [...] "The half-hour was shrewdly precise in its targets: The older audience that communes on Facebook (such as parents and grandparents) as well as lonely kids; as usual, [...] "South Park" [...] is merciless when <b>it</b> <b>smells</b> a baby-boomer-adopted trend." [...] Ramsey Isler of IGN gave the episode a 9/10, calling it [...] "brilliant from beginning to end, {{and one of the best}} episodes the series has served up in a while." [...] Carlos Delgado of iF Magazine wrote that [...] "You have 0 Friends has the right amount of humor, intelligence, and sarcasm to match any South Park episode. The question is, does it become an instant classic?" [...] Cristina Everett of the New York Daily News called the episode [...] "hilarious, yet heartwarming", adding that the Kip Drordy subplot was [...] "endearing".|$|E
500|$|Presley {{undertook}} three brief tours {{during the}} year, continuing {{to generate a}} crazed audience response. A Detroit newspaper suggested that [...] "the trouble with going to see Elvis Presley is that you're liable to get killed." [...] Villanova students pelted him with eggs in Philadelphia, and in Vancouver, the crowd rioted {{after the end of}} the show, destroying the stage. Frank Sinatra, who had famously inspired the swooning of teenaged girls in the 1940s, condemned the new musical phenomenon. In a magazine article, he decried rock and roll as [...] "brutal, ugly, degenerate, vicious.... It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people. <b>It</b> <b>smells</b> phoney and false. It is sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons.... This rancid-smelling aphrodisiac I deplore." [...] Asked for a response, Presley said, [...] "I admire the man. He has a right to say what he wants to say. He is a great success and a fine actor, but I think he shouldn't have said it.... This is a trend, just the same as he faced when he started years ago." ...|$|E

500|$|Episode {{writer and}} {{executive}} show producer Danny Smith has written all Family Guy episodes to date to feature Francis; {{the first was}} [...] "Holy Crap". After Francis puts up the Christian cross on the Griffins' dining table, Stewie's line, [...] "Yeah, nothing says 'eat up' like a bleeding, half-naked Jew nailed {{to a piece of}} wood," [...] was censored from the FOX and syndicated airings, but retained on the Cartoon Network, TBS, and DVD versions. On Adult Swim, this episode was rated TV-MA due to its religiously blasphemous content, but on TBS and all other Adult Swim airings, the episode is rated TV-14-DL. [...] A sequence shows Peter saying, [...] "I'm sorry, but if another person says taint today, I am going to bust a nut", after the doctor informs him and Lois that Stewie was exposed to tainted holy water, was intended {{to be included in the}} episode, but was removed for unknown reasons. After Stewie is placed in a square box to quarantine him, Lois is shown leaving him halfway through changing his diaper—Stewie then says [...] "finish the job, woman! <b>It</b> <b>smells</b> like New Orleans in here". The script for this episode, including this sketch, was prepared before the events of Hurricane Katrina, so it was never intended to coincide with the events of Katrina. On all airings (including the volume 3 DVD set), Stewie's line has been changed to [...] "It smells like Brian Dennehy in here!" ...|$|E
500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode an [...] "A–" [...] {{and called it}} a [...] "very, very good piece of television". He was {{particularly}} pleased with the grimness of the story; he noted that it was largely about {{the way in which}} Mulder's [...] "belief system [...] eradicated before his very eyes" [...] after the suicide of his mom. VanDerWerff was also pleased with Duchovny's performance, writing that he [...] "brings the intense mania to Mulder that has always made the character work at his best." [...] Despite this, he was slightly critical of the concept of the [...] "walk-ins", which he called [...] "patently ridiculous". Rich Rosell from DigitallyObsessed.com awarded the episode 4.5 out of 5 stars and wrote that while [...] "Chris Carter penned this episode, [...] his attempts at clarifying his own confounded mythology are often even more confusing than revelatory, 'Sein Und Zeit' is a tense installment, and leads neatly to the supposed wrap-up in the second half. [...] " [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a largely positive review, writing [...] "'Sein Und Zeit' not only served as a reminder of Fox Mulder's ongoing pain it provided yet another clue that, although its journey is nearing its completion, The X-Files still knows how to make the ride an enjoyable one." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five. The two called the episode [...] "a welcome return to an X-Files we haven't seen for awhile—hard, passionate, and with an urgent story to tell. From where I'm sitting, {{in the middle of a}} lacklustre season, <b>it</b> <b>smells</b> strongly of a masterpiece." ...|$|E
500|$|Just {{like the}} text—which was mostly written {{on top of}} {{photographs}}—the photographs on the book are highly sexual and depict nudity, [...] simulations of sexual acts, bondage, homosexuality and analingus, with accessories such as knives, whips, masks and chains; however, full intercourse is never shown. Aside from unknown models, featured in the book are actress Isabella Rossellini, rappers Big Daddy Kane and Madonna's then boyfriend Vanilla Ice, model Naomi Campbell, gay porn star Joey Stefano, actor Udo Kier, socialite Tatiana von Fürstenberg, and nightclub owner Ingrid Casares; however the heterosexual photos in the book involve only Madonna and Vanilla Ice. Madonna herself is featured partially or completely naked. One of the book's most famous photographs shows Madonna hitchhiking completely naked in Miami. The book also reflects a great part on Dita's perspective towards her own sexuality. Dita writes in Sex that her [...] "pussy" [...] is a temple of learning and that exposing it, is really a homage to it ("It's hard to describe <b>it</b> <b>smells</b> like a baby to me fresh and full of life. I love my pussy, it is the complete summation of my life"). Sex contains statements like [...] "ass fucking is the most pleasurable way to get fucked and it hurts the most too". Others include [...] "here is something comforting about being tied up. Like {{when you were a}} baby and your mother strapped you in the car seat. She wanted you to be safe. It was an act of love" [...] and [...] "I wouldn't want a penis. It would be like having a third leg. it seems like a contraption that would get in the way. I think I have a dick in my brain". In Sex, Dita also pointed out that [...] "A lot of people are afraid to say what they want. That's why they don't get what they want". The book includes Madonna's perspective on pornography: ...|$|E
