5|$|Aside from a {{comprehensive}} modernization in 1929–31, Arizona was regularly used for training exercises between the wars, including the annual Fleet Problems (training exercises).

In July 1934, the ship was featured in a Jimmy Cagney film, <b>Here</b> <b>Comes</b> the Navy, about the romantic troubles of a sailor. In April 1940, she {{and the rest of}} the Pacific Fleet were transferred from California to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, as a deterrent to Japanese imperialism.|$|E

When the rain was gone, <b>here</b> <b>came</b> another token anon. <b>Here</b> <b>came</b> black flies, and flew in men's eyes; in their mouth, in their nose, their lives went all to destruction; such multitude of flies here was that they ate the corn and the grass. Woe was all the folk that dwelt in the land! Thereafter came such a mortality that few here remained alive. Afterward <b>here</b> <b>came</b> an evil hap, that king Riwald died.|$|R

5|$|Cagney {{returned}} to the studio and made Hard to Handle in 1933.

5|$|The {{phylogeny}} of Anthozoans is {{not clearly}} understood {{and a number}} of different models have been proposed. Within the Hexacorallia, the sea anemones, coral anemones and stony corals may constitute a monophyletic grouping united by their six-fold symmetry and cnidocyte trait. The Octocorallia appears to be monophyletic, and primitive members of this group may have been stolonate. The cladogram presented <b>here</b> <b>comes</b> from a 2014 study by Stampar et al. which was based on the divergence of mitochondrial DNA within the group and on nuclear markers.|$|E
5|$|To address criticisms {{levelled}} at Blyton's work some later editions {{have been}} altered to reflect more liberal attitudes towards {{issues such as}} race, gender and the treatment of children; modern reprints of the Noddy series substitute teddy bears or goblins for golliwogs, for instance. The golliwogs who steal Noddy's car and dump him naked in the Dark Wood in <b>Here</b> <b>Comes</b> Noddy Again are replaced by goblins in the 1986 revision, who strip Noddy only of his shoes and hat and return {{at the end of}} the story to apologise.|$|E

5|$|Every {{game that}} has been {{produced}} in the WWE 2K series is developed by Yuke's and Visual Concepts, and published by 2K Sports. From 1999 – 2013 the publisher was THQ. The game engine was originally based on the one used by the Japanese professional wrestling video game series Toukon Retsuden, which was also developed by Yuke's. Before the release of WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw, the only communication possible in season mode was through subtitles. Voice over, however, was included in season mode {{with the release of}} WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW. WWE superstars record a script, which is then assigned to the voice of the corresponding superstar in the game. With the exception of WWE SmackDown! <b>Here</b> <b>Comes</b> the Pain, pre-recorded commentary by WWE commentators has been included in each game since the release of WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It.|$|E
5|$|In early 1934, {{the ship}} and her crew were {{featured}} in a James Cagney film for Warner Brothers, <b>Here</b> <b>Comes</b> the Navy, which made extensive use of exterior footage as well as on-board location shots. In the early morning of 26 July, Arizona collided with a fishing trawler, Umatilla, that was under tow by another trawler off Cape Flattery. Two men aboard the Umatilla {{were killed in the}} collision and the Navy convened a Court of Inquiry to investigate the incident. The court recommended that the ship's captain, Captain MacGillivray Milne, be court-martialed. This took place at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba, while the ship was participating in that year's Fleet Problem off the East Coast. Milne was judged guilty and replaced several months later by Captain George Baum after the ship returned to the West Coast. In the meantime, Rear Admiral Samuel W. Bryant assumed command of Battleship Division Two on 4 September, with Arizona as his flagship.|$|E
