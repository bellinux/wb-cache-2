IEC requires certain degrees of ingress protection against direct contact. Indirect contact protections can be achieved by earthed equipotential bonding and automatic disconnection of supply by using Residual Current Devices, for example.|$|E
50|$|Earthing connects exposed {{conductive}} {{parts of}} electrical equipment to earth {{in order to}} complete a circuit {{in the event that}} the insulation on a live conductor should fail. Earthing therefore provides a return path for the current required to blow fuses or trip circuit breakers and RCDs, and ensures that the supply is reliably disconnected {{in the event of a}} fault. Bonding is the connection of the <b>exposed</b> <b>conductive</b> <b>part</b> of electrical equipment or objects like mains water / gas supply pipe to the main Earth terminal (MET) to bring all exposed metalwork into the same electrical potential. This is done to minimise the danger of electric shock due to human contact with live parts which could result from bad insulation and insulation failures. Bonding wires are typically thicker than earthing wires to ensure that they have a sufficiently low resistance that hazardous voltages (as calculated by V=IR) cannot appear even in the presence of large fault currents. In domestic wiring, earthing of equipment is done by bonding together the earth points and metallic parts of the appliances and earthed bodies using green/yellow wire coming from the consumer main earthing terminal. The earth terminal is in turn connected to either consumerâ€™s earth electrode (TT system) or to the earth point given by the supplier (TN system). In pre-1966 buildings, the earthing may be connected only to the plumbing system, which is creating potential earthing problems in buildings where the metal pipes are being replaced by non-conductive plastic pipes.|$|E

These parameters include earth potential rise, ground resistance, soil resistivity, touch voltage, step voltage and transferred potential to the LV network. The aim of this work is the preparation, analysis and subsequent evaluation for the real measurement in practice. These earthing-system measurements were carried out at the distribution station and the concrete pole with a section disconnector. Then a numerical model of the grounding system of concrete pole was created in ANSYS. Subsequent evaluation of the results as numerical terms (comparison measurements and simulated results) and evaluation in terms of analytical (measurement results compliance with the standard) including the numerical model of the earthing system is solved in the practical part of the master's thesis...|$|E

40|$|The bonding of {{electrical}} equipment plays {{a crucial role}} in maintaining the same potential between <b>conductive</b> <b>parts</b> likely to be energized and <b>conductive</b> <b>parts</b> liable to introduce a "zero" potential into the premises.

40|$|International (IEC) European (CENELEC) and American (NEC) Standards require, in each building, the {{connection}} of extraneous <b>conductive</b> <b>parts</b> (i. e. metal water or gas pipes) to the main grounding terminal. There are two good reasons for this: the voltage between extraneous <b>conductive</b> <b>parts</b> and <b>exposed</b> <b>conductive</b> <b>parts</b> is zeroed and extraneous <b>conductive</b> <b>parts</b> {{can contribute to the}} leakage of fault current into the ground. There is however a third advantage in the bonding connection: the entire structure (floors and walls of the building), together with the exposed and the extraneous metallic parts, forms a quasi-equipotential system, with the consequent strong reduction of touch voltages. Metallic pipes and reinforcement of reinforced concrete have a particular relevance thanks to their large widespread through buildings. However, in some practical cases, {{it is not possible to}} connect all extraneous <b>conductive</b> <b>parts</b> to the protective equipotential bonding because they are not accessible. In the paper, the reduction of touch voltages in buildings, when these extraneous <b>conductive</b> <b>parts</b> are present but not connected to the protective equipotential bonding is quantified. Different building models are created and solved by the finite element method in order to calculate touch voltages in different scenarios. The results show that the mere presence of widespread metallic parts in buildings helps to reduce touch voltages, but not enough to ensure safety against indirect contacts. The electrical installation safety performance is greatly improved in reinforced concrete buildings if at least some easily accessible parts, like water or central heating pipes, are connected to the main grounding terminal. Also in brick buildings, they provide a certain reduction of GPR, maximum and mean touch voltages...|$|R
