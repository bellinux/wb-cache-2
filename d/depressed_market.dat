25|$|Before {{getting married}} Jonathan {{and his first}} wife had {{regularly}} visited Las Vegas, drawn to the city's live entertainment scene. When the Canadian real estate market collapsed in 2008 they moved there that December. The recession was further along in the U.S., and Jonathan saw an opportunity to buy cheap properties while pursuing his career as an illusionist. Convincing J.D. to come with them, they made their home in the nearby suburb of Summerlin, Nevada. Jonathan opened a third branch of Scott Real Esate and, considering the <b>depressed</b> <b>market,</b> switched to leasing properties, but for only 80-percent of the market rates to help renters who were recovering from the ongoing recession.|$|E
2500|$|The close {{relation}} between the papacy and the branch declined over the years, with the decline especially pronounced after 1464, with few to no branch managers being selected to be the [...] "depositary-general", the official who was essentially the fiscal agent for the Apostolic Chamber, or the Church's treasury. Pope Sixtus IV would repudiate the Medici's control of the alum trade and also his debts to them, as well as seizing Medici property in Rome following the Pazzi Conspiracy in 1478. The Pazzi's interlocked businesses and banks had captured the alum business after the Medici were removed from it, and were supplying the depositary-general from their ranks, indicating {{that they were trying}} to follow the Medici route of initially building up their empire through papal custom. The papacy would eventually agree to repay the debts, but did so extremely slowly; so slowly that the branch manager Giovanni Tornabouni agreed to take stocks of alum instead, despite the <b>depressed</b> <b>market</b> for alum. Tornabuoni would still be in charge when 1494 came and the edifice of the Medici came crashing down. Because the branch had been doing so poorly, it owed more than it was due, so the Roman government was satisfied to allow Tornabouni to assume the rest of the partnership's equity and debts.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to damages {{for not getting}} the thing promised itself, a contract breaker must compensate for the costly consequences of the breach that one would reasonably expect to exist. There must be a causal connection between the breach and the consequence complained of. In Saamco v York Montague Ltd it was held a bank could not recover damages from property valuer {{for all of the}} difference in what the properties it bought after getting the valuations were assured to be and actual property values, because {{a large part of the}} difference resulted from generally <b>depressed</b> <b>market</b> prices following [...] "Black Wednesday" [...] in 1992. In a business deal, calculation will typically be based on the forgone profits that one could reasonably have expected to make. This could also include the [...] "loss of a chance" [...] to profit, so in Chaplin v Hicks an entrant in a beauty contest wrongfully excluded from the final round was awarded 25% of the final prize money to reflect her 1 in 4 chance of having won. One limit lies at consequential losses that are too [...] "remote", or are not a natural result of the breach, and are not in the parties' contemplation. In Hadley v Baxendale a miller tried to recover damages from Baxendale's delivery company for the lost profits from his mill grinding to a halt, after they were late delivering a crankshaft back from being fixed. But Alderson B held that because millers would usually be expected to keep spare crank shafts, and because he had not informed Baxendale of the importance of the timely delivery, an award for profits could not be compensated. More recently in The Achilleas the majority of the House of Lords preferred to express the remoteness rule as one of construing the contract to reflect the parties' [...] "background of market expectations". Transfield Shipping returned The Achilleas late to its owner, Mercator, which led Mercator to lose a lucrative contract with Cargill that would make over $1.3million, an occurrence that was plainly a natural consequence of the breach and easily foreseeable. Yet because the standard practice and expectation in the shipping industry was that if a ship were returned late only the ordinary sum for hire would be due, this was the limit on recovery. It is also possible to lose one's entitlement to damages if steps are not taken to mitigate further losses, that any prudent person would, rather than sitting back and letting losses run up. But the burden of proof of a failure to mitigate is on a contract breaker, to whom the courts are unlikely to be sympathetic. A contract breaker could may also, if a concurrent liability arises in tort, argue a claimant's damages should be reduced to reflect their contributory fault, and the courts can reduce an award to achieve a just and equitable result. Sometimes potential profits will be too uncertain, or a general fall in market prices means that even claiming damages for the thing itself would leave one in a negative position, and so the courts allow a claimant to choose whether to sue, not for a failure in expectations, but to cover her expenses in preparing for the contract, or the [...] "reliance interest". In Anglia Television Ltd v Reed a TV channel successfully sued Robert Reed for not turning up for shooting a film. It was unclear whether the film would make any profits at all, and so Anglia TV got compensated for its wasted expenses in preparing the set. The level of damages is generally assessed at the date of the breach, but this is variable if the court thinks another time would be fairer.|$|E

50|$|These {{entities}} also borrowed short-term, {{meaning they}} {{had to go back to}} the proverbial well frequently for additional funds, while purchasing long-term, illiquid (hard to sell) assets. When the crisis hit and they could no longer obtain short-term financing, they were forced to sell these long-term assets into very <b>depressed</b> <b>markets</b> at fire-sale prices, making credit more difficult to obtain system-wide. The 1998 Long-term Capital Management crisis was a precursor to this aspect of the current crisis, as a highly leveraged shadow banking entity with systemic implications collapsed during that crisis.|$|R

50|$|The {{risks that}} arise {{are the same}} that Banks have always faced: First, the {{solvency}} of the SIV {{may be at risk}} if the value of the long-term security that the SIV has bought falls below that of the short-term securities that the SIV has sold. Banks typically avoid this risk by not marking to market their loan portfolios. Second, there is a liquidity risk, as the SIV borrows short term and invests long term; i.e., outpayments become due before the inpayments are due. Unless the borrower can refinance short-term at favorable rates, he may be forced to sell the asset into a <b>depressed</b> <b>market.</b>|$|E

50|$|In early 1913 {{there was}} an {{unexpected}} crash in the Calgary real estate market, {{after many years of}} boom. Tregillus had difficulty staying afloat.

At the UFA's annual convention in January 1914 he asked, “Shall we be a great, peaceful and prosperous country or shall we be simply the appanage and humble subordinate of a great military Power?”On 13 February 1914 Tregillus was unable to meet a bill of $4,550.Late in July 1914 he resigned from the Board of the University of Calgary.The university was closed soon after.|$|E

[...] In 1994, to create an Asian bond market, they hired Andre Lee from Lehman Brothers to head their fixed income department. Lee, a French Canadian-Korean who grew up within the American military presence in Seoul, was described as a [...] "wild man" [...] and [...] "a salesman who could 'sell snow to the Eskimos.'" [...] By 1996, Lee's operations provided one half of Peregrine's profits. Almost single-handedly, Lee created the Asian junk bond market.|$|E
50|$|His popular {{father had}} been the most prosperous {{merchant}} at Strabane, controlling {{a large proportion of the}} general business of two or three Northern Irish counties. As a ship-owner, for many years he sent emigrants across to New Brunswick and the United States. But, by the 1840s, Leslie Gault's finances were hit by severe losses in the Grain trade and by the removal of duty on Baltic timber. On top of these difficulties, three of his ships were lost at sea while the cargoes of his five remaining ships were being thrown on a <b>depressed</b> <b>market,</b> draining him of a lifetime's savings. In 1842, his father decided to make a new start and sailed with his family to Montreal. On arriving, his mother fell ill and was advised to return to Ireland, and only nine months later his father died of cholera.|$|E
50|$|Critics of U.S. {{agricultural}} policy {{claim that it}} may be in violation of World Trade Organization agreements, asserting that domestic subsidies may be considered to be a non-tariff trade barrier. Others, including the Cato Institute's Center for Trade Policy Studies, the Union of Concerned Scientists, the Iowa Corn Growers Association, and Oxfam America, argue that subsidizing domestic grains leads to overproduction that is harmful both for farmers and for the general public. They claim that subsidies <b>depress</b> <b>market</b> prices while increasing land values. Many farmers do not own their land, and as a result, the subsidies they receive are capitalized into the value of the land they farm, and therefore provide little benefit to the farmers themselves.|$|R

5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, the money market for CP {{is far more}} volatile. There are no {{government}} guarantees for these products in case of default, and both sellers and lenders have equal power at setting the rate. This explains why the borrowing side of SIV consists of fixed term (30 to 270 days) rather than on-demand (1 day) deposits; however, in extreme circumstances like the 2007-8 credit crunch, the worried usual buyers of CP, facing liquidity worries, might buy more secure bonds such as government bonds or simply put money in bank deposits instead and decline to buy CP. If this happens, facing maturity of short term CP which was sold previously, SIV {{might be forced to}} sell their assets to pay off the debts. If the price of asset in <b>depressed</b> <b>market</b> is not adequate to cover the debt, SIV will default.|$|E
50|$|In October 1929, his Consolidated Film Industries {{took control}} of ARC (American Record Corporation, a company created {{as a result of}} a merger between a number of dime store record labels). In the {{following}} years, the company was very involved in a very <b>depressed</b> <b>market</b> for phonograph records, buying failing labels at bargain prices to exploit their catalogue. (In December 1931 Warner Bros. leased Brunswick Records, Vocalion Records and associated companies to ARC.) In 1932, ARC was king of the 3 records for a dollar market, selling 6 million units, twice as much as RCA Victor. In an effort to get back on top, RCA launched the low priced Bluebird Records label. ARC bought out the Columbia Records catalogue in 1934. In the 1930s ARC produced Brunswick and Columbia at 75c and Oriole (for McCrory), Romeo (for Kress), Melotone, Vocalion, Banner, Conqueror (for Sears) and Perfect at 35c or 3 for $1.00.|$|E
50|$|Painter was mentored by {{art dealer}} Leo Castelli and curator Walter Hopps. In 1991, he began Patrick Painter Editions in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and Hong Kong, {{with his first}} edition (of three) being two prints by Roy Arden.

40|$|Existing {{research}} shows that significantly more acquisitions occur when stock markets are booming than when <b>markets</b> are <b>depressed.</b> Rhodes-Kropf and Viswanathan (2004) hypothesize that firm-specific and market-wide valuations lead to an excess of mergers, and these will be value destroying. This article investigates whether acquisitions occurring during booming markets are fundamentally different from those occurring during <b>depressed</b> <b>markets.</b> We find that acquirers buying during high-valuation markets have significantly higher announcement returns but lower long-run abnormal stock and operating performance than those buying during low-valuation markets. We investigate possible explanations for the long-run underperformance and conclude it is consistent with managerial herding. The Author 2007.
