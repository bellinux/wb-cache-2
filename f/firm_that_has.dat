As a result 110 firms, they had {{applied for the}} loan and 89 firms they had not applied for the loan in previous years. As Table 12 (Appendix 7) shows out of the total <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> applied with formal financial institutions, most of them (57  %) are risk rationed borrowers. This implies {{that most of the}} firm owners are not interested to receive the loan from credit market for collateral risk and fear of repayment. The number of <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> applied in previous years is unconstrained borrowers which are also high. From the total <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> not been experienced in previous years, most of them (49  %) are unconstrained non-borrowers.

You receive your water, you make your deposit, and now what more would you have? Gold, diamonds, power, fame? All in a single moment these things have withered to dirt, dust, ashes. The world has nothing to give you now. For you it is bankrupt.|$|E

Theorizing on the positive feedback loops by which firms with competitive advantage have facilitated access to acquire new resources, we proposed a distribution we believe data on firm performance should follow. We illustrate our model by assessing its fit to data on firm performance, addressing its theoretical implications and comparing it to previous works...|$|R

While previous studies focused mainly on the characteristics of VC and/or PE financed firms as opposed to the <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> did not <b>have</b> outside equity in their capital structure before the IPOs, we investigate the differences in performance and risk characteristics of VC only versus PE involved <b>firms.</b> We find <b>that</b> investors in PE backed IPO firms earn economically and statistically significant 6. 68 % more in the first trading day than do the VC backed firms. In other words, the issuing <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> PE <b>firms</b> involved at least in one round of pre-IPO financing, have to leave 6. 68 % more money on the table at the IPO than do the <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> only VC financing.
