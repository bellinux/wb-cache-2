5|$|Having {{pushed the}} Crusaders out {{of most of}} Syria, the Ayyubids {{generally}} adopted a policy of peace with them. The war with the Crusaders did not prevent Muslims under Ayyubid governance from developing good commercial relations with European states. This led to <b>fruitful</b> interaction between both sides in different fields of economic activity, particularly in agriculture and trade.|$|E
5|$|Juno was {{the first}} {{asteroid}} for which an occultation was observed. It passed {{in front of a}} dim star (SAO 112328) on February 19, 1958. Since then, several occultations by Juno have been observed, the most <b>fruitful</b> being the occultation of SAO 115946 on December 11, 1979, which was registered by 18 observers.|$|E
5|$|Nigerian {{television}} {{has been a}} particularly <b>fruitful</b> source for episode recovery; a total of 15 out of the 50 episodes recovered since 1978 have been reclaimed from Nigeria, leading to the completion of three full serials (The Time Meddler, The War Machines, and The Enemy of the World).|$|E

5|$|Allen had {{initially}} intended to study {{to become a}} minister, but after his father became too ill to work, he instead went into teaching. He {{became a member of}} <b>Fruitful</b> Vale All-Age's teaching staff at age 17. Two years later, and following the death of his father, Allen went to Moneague Teachers' College to receive formal training in teaching. He became a teacher at an All-Age school in Saint Mary Parish after graduation. Between 1979 and 1983, Allen served as the principal at a succession of schools; Robins Bay All-Age School, Hillside Primary School, and finally Port Maria High School.|$|E
5|$|An {{area known}} as the Marius Hills was {{considered}} for Apollo 15, but it was determined by mission planners that a landing {{on the edge of}} Mare Imbrium at the Hadley-Apennine site would be more scientifically <b>fruitful</b> than the Marius Hills alternative, and placing a seismometer at Hadley-Apennine, given the locations of seismic packages from previous Apollo expeditions, would create a more optimal configuration for seismic study.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} after its discovery, the {{evolutionary}} origins of Triceratops remained largely obscure. In 1922, the newly discovered Protoceratops was seen as its ancestor by Henry Fairfield Osborn, but many decades passed before additional findings came to light. Recent years have been <b>fruitful</b> for the discovery of several dinosaurs related to ancestors of Triceratops. Zuniceratops, the earliest known ceratopsian with brow horns, was described in the late 1990s, and Yinlong, the first known Jurassic ceratopsian, in 2005.|$|E
5|$|France's {{blockade}} {{had lasted}} for two years, and the 'American' government, inspired by 'American' spirit, was facing off with France, European principles, European pretensions. The social {{results of the}} French blockade, however, had been <b>fruitful</b> for the Argentine Republic, and served to demonstrate in all their nakedness {{the current state of}} mind and the new elements of struggle, which were to ignite a fierce war that can end only with the fall of that monstrous government.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, J. Alan Robinson had {{discovered}} a simple method to implement deduction on computers, the resolution and unification algorithm. However, straightforward implementations, like those attempted by McCarthy and his students in the late 60s, were especially intractable: the programs required astronomical numbers of steps to prove simple theorems. A more <b>fruitful</b> approach to logic {{was developed in the}} 1970s by Robert Kowalski at the University of Edinburgh, and soon this led to the collaboration with French researchers Alain Colmerauer and Philippe Roussel who created the successful logic programming language Prolog.|$|E
5|$|In {{northern}} and western Africa, the desiccation and humectation {{of the modern}} Sahara desert has led to very <b>fruitful</b> archaeological sites, followed by completely barren soil, only to once again show evidence of population when the aridity of the region was ameliorated. Preservation in these two regions are alternately superb and lamentable, yet the sites that have been uncovered document the adaptive nature of early hominins to climatically unstable environments. Researchers such as Marean and Assefa consider the historic distinction between northern Africa {{and the rest of}} Africa, as though they represent divergent cultural developments, an arbitrary and antiquated distinction.|$|E
5|$|Patrick Linton Allen {{was born}} in Kingston, Jamaica, on 7 February 1951. He was the fourth of five {{children}} to Ferdinand Allen, a farmer, and Christiana Allen (née Grant), a housewife. His parents were subsistence farmers {{in a region that}} had been devastated by Hurricane Charlie around the time of his birth. Allen attended the <b>Fruitful</b> Vale All-Age School as a child. Beginning at grade one, Allen was a year ahead in school.|$|E
5|$|Sarvapitri amavasya (all ancestors' {{new moon}} day) is {{intended}} for all ancestors, irrespective of the lunar day they died. It {{is the most important}} day of the Pitru Paksha. Those who have forgotten to perform shraddha can do so on this day. A shraddha ritual performed on this day is considered as <b>fruitful</b> as one conducted in the holy city of Gaya, which is seen as a special place to perform the rite, and hosts a fair during the Pitru Paksha period.|$|E
5|$|Symbolic {{behavior}} is, perhaps, one of {{the most}} difficult aspects of modern human behavior to distinguish archaeologically. When searching for evidence of symbolic behavior in the MSA, there are three lines of evidence that can be considered: direct evidence reflecting concrete examples of symbols; indirect evidence reflecting behaviors that would have been used to convey symbolic thought; and technological evidence reflecting the tools and skills that would have been used to produce art. Direct evidence is difficult to find beyond 40ka, and indirect evidence is essentially intangible, thus technological evidence is the most <b>fruitful</b> of the three.|$|E
5|$|The {{most troubling}} aspect of colonizing the patroonships was enlisting the {{required}} number of colonists, {{so that the}} failure {{of many of the}} other proposed patroonships may in part be attributed to this fact. The patroons still dealt with the issues of a cautious people not caring to venture to an undeveloped world. As an owner of extensive lands in the sandy Gooi and of family estates in the not much more <b>fruitful</b> Veluwe, where several relatives were landowners and struggled to subsist on meager means, Van Rensselaer had an advantage — his agents needed to employ little persuasion to induce some Gooiers and Veluwers to migrate to more <b>fruitful</b> regions where the farming would be less difficult. In addition, he could depend on the indirect support of his nephew Wouter van Twiller, who had been appointed Director of New Netherland in 1632, and with whom he engaged in friendly correspondence at a time when Dutch directors opposed the patroons in every way. In 1634 he collaborated with Michael Reyniersz Pauw, the patroon of Pavonia on shipping cattle.|$|E
5|$|This period, {{between the}} eighth and the 10th centuries, saw a {{tripartite}} {{struggle for the}} resources of the rich Gangetic plains, each of these three empires annexing the seat of power at Kannauj for short periods of time. At their peak the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta ruled a vast empire stretching from the Ganges River and Yamuna River doab in the north to Cape Comorin in the south, a <b>fruitful</b> time of political expansion, architectural achievements and famous literary contributions. The early kings of this dynasty were influenced by Hinduism and the later kings by Jainism.|$|E
5|$|Warner's {{next two}} years were less <b>fruitful.</b> The 1900 {{football}} team went 6–4–1, losing three games to the Big Four, and the 1901 season was a losing one, with Carlisle posting a 5–7–1 record. The following year, the team posted an improved 8–3 record, when Warner began implementing double (lateral) passes. Carlisle's quarterback Jimmy Johnson would make a lateral pass to the halfback running towards the sideline, bringing the defense {{with him as he}} tossed the ball back to the fast-running Johnson.|$|E
5|$|While the Tao Te Ching is most famous, {{there are}} many other {{important}} texts in traditional Taoism. Taishang Ganying Pian ("Treatise of the Exalted One on Response and Retribution") discusses sin and ethics, and has become a popular morality tract in the last few centuries. It asserts that those in harmony with Tao will live long and <b>fruitful</b> lives. The wicked, and their descendants, will suffer and have shortened lives.|$|E
5|$|After a two-and-a-half-season absence, Lippi {{returned}} to the club in 2001, following his replacement Carlo Ancelotti's dismissal, signing big name players such as Gianluigi Buffon, David Trezeguet, Pavel Nedvěd and Lilian Thuram, helping the team to two more scudetto titles during the 2001–02 and 2002–03 seasons. Juventus were also part of an all Italian Champions League final in 2003, but lost out to Milan on penalties after the game ended in a 0–0 draw. At {{the conclusion of the}} following season, Lippi was appointed as the Italy national team's head coach, bringing an end {{to one of the most}} <b>fruitful</b> managerial spells in Juventus' history.|$|E
5|$|Air Force {{planners}} {{believed that}} Operation Commando Hunt VII (1 November 1971 to 29 March 1972) {{would be the}} most <b>fruitful</b> of the entire campaign. During this dry season phase, the U.S. averaged 182 attack fighters, 13 fixed-wing gunships, and 21 B-52 sorties per day. As a result of this all-out effort, U.S. intelligence analysts claimed 10,689 North Vietnamese trucks were destroyed and credited AC-130E Spectres alone with 7,335 of these kills. During the campaign, however, ominous signs appeared in the mountains of Laos. On 10 January 1972, a U.S. 0–1 observation aircraft, flying near the Mu Gia Pass, dodged the first surface-to-air missile(SAM) launched from Laotian soil. This event, and others like it, were compounded by the crossing into Laotian airspace of North Vietnamese MiG fighters. Both of these threats tended to force off B-52 and tactical air strikes. During the campaign, ten American aircraft were lost to SAMs (mostly SA-2 Guideline)s and another thirteen were lost to more conventional weapons.|$|E
5|$|Blonde on Blonde is {{the seventh}} studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, {{released}} on May 16, 1966, on Columbia Records. Recording sessions began in New York in October 1965 with numerous backing musicians, {{including members of}} Dylan's live backing band, the Hawks. Though sessions continued until January 1966, they yielded only one track that made it onto the final album—"One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)". At producer Bob Johnston's suggestion, Dylan, keyboardist Al Kooper, and guitarist Robbie Robertson moved to the CBS studios in Nashville, Tennessee. These sessions, augmented by some of Nashville's top session musicians, were more <b>fruitful,</b> and in February and March all the remaining songs for the album were recorded.|$|E
5|$|Dian was conquered {{during a}} {{military}} campaign launched by Han Wudi in 109 BCE, and the Yizhou commandery {{was established in}} the former kingdom. Archaeologists discovered the king of Dian's imperial seal inscribed by the Han, confirming Dian's surrender and status as a subject of the Han. The Dian led a series of unsuccessful rebellions against Han rule, beginning with two revolts in 86 BCE and 83 BCE. Chen Li, governor of the Zangge commandery, crushed a rebellion in 28–35 BCE. Under Wang Mang's reign as usurper of the Han throne between 9-23 CE, hostilities in southwestern China persisted. Wang sent military campaigns to quell the unrest. Seventy percent of the soldiers in one campaign died from illness. Another campaign, comprising 100,000 men and with double the supplies, was not <b>fruitful.</b> Rebellions continued in 42-45 and 176.|$|E
5|$|English has {{a strong}} {{influence}} on the vocabulary of other languages. The influence of English comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the English language, the role of English as a world lingua franca, and {{the large number of}} books and films that are translated from English into other languages. That pervasive use of English leads to a conclusion in many places that English is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies. Among varieties of English, it is especially American English that influences other languages. Some languages, such as Chinese, write words borrowed from English mostly as calques, while others, such as Japanese, readily take in English loanwords written in sound-indicating script. Dubbed films and television programmes are an especially <b>fruitful</b> source of English influence on languages in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Festivals often {{involved}} a ceremonial procession {{in which a}} cult image was carried out of the temple in a barque-shaped shrine. These processions served various purposes. In Roman times, when local deities of all kinds were believed to have power over the Nile inundation, processions in many communities carried temple images to the riverbanks so the gods could invoke a large and <b>fruitful</b> flood. Processions also traveled between temples, as when the image of Hathor from Dendera Temple visited her consort Horus at the Temple of Edfu. Rituals for a god were often based in that deity's mythology. Such rituals {{were meant to be}} repetitions of the events of the mythic past, renewing the beneficial effects of the original events. In the Khoiak festival in honor of Osiris, his death and resurrection were ritually reenacted at a time when crops were beginning to sprout. The returning greenery symbolized the renewal of the god's own life.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{apparent}} {{success of the}} cane toad in eating the beetles threatening the sugarcane plantations of Puerto Rico, and the <b>fruitful</b> introductions into Hawaii and the Philippines, a strong push was made for the cane toad {{to be released in}} Australia to negate the pests ravaging the Queensland cane fields. As a result, 102 toads were collected from Hawaii and brought to Australia. After an initial release in August 1935, the Commonwealth Department of Health decided to ban future introductions until a study was conducted into the feeding habits of the toad. The study was completed in 1936 and the ban lifted, when large-scale releases were undertaken; by March 1937, 62,000 toadlets had been released into the wild. The toads became firmly established in Queensland, increasing exponentially in number and extending their range into the Northern Territory and New South Wales. In 2010, one was found on the far western coast in Broome, Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|Gay {{chose to}} study {{sociology}} and marketing, {{and the university}} environment gave the 22-year-old sprinter his first opportunity to compete in NCAA events. In the NCAA Men's Indoor Track and Field Championship in March, Gay finished fourth in the 60 meters, with 6.63s, and fifth in the closely fought 200m {{with a time of}} 20.58s (he missed out on second place by only two hundredths of a second). The NCAA Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship in June proved far more <b>fruitful,</b> however, as Gay became Arkansas' first 100m NCAA champion, setting a school record of 10.06s. Furthermore, his efforts in the event helped the Arkansas athletic team win the NCAA Championship.|$|E
5|$|Hilbert spaces arise {{naturally}} {{and frequently}} {{in mathematics and}} physics, typically as infinite-dimensional function spaces. The earliest Hilbert spaces were studied {{from this point of}} view in the first decade of the 20th century by David Hilbert, Erhard Schmidt, and Frigyes Riesz. They are indispensable tools in the theories of partial differential equations, quantum mechanics, Fourier analysis (which includes applications to signal processing and heat transfer)—and ergodic theory, which forms the mathematical underpinning of thermodynamics. John von Neumann coined the term Hilbert space for the abstract concept that underlies many of these diverse applications. The success of Hilbert space methods ushered in a very <b>fruitful</b> era for functional analysis. Apart from the classical Euclidean spaces, examples of Hilbert spaces include spaces of square-integrable functions, spaces of sequences, Sobolev spaces consisting of generalized functions, and Hardy spaces of holomorphic functions.|$|E
5|$|Impressed with Abovian's {{thirst for}} knowledge, Parrot {{arranged}} for a Russian state scholarship for Abovian to study at the University of Dorpat in 1830. He entered the university directly without additional preparation and studied in the Philosophy faculty of the Philological-Historical department from September 3, 1830 until January 18, 1836. The years in Dorpat were very <b>fruitful</b> for Abovian who studied social and natural sciences, European literature and philosophy, and mastered German, Russian, French and Latin. At this time Abovian fell {{under the influence of}} German Romanticism. In addition, Abovian established numerous contacts with European intellectuals of the time. At the university he became friends with the sons of Nikolay Karamzin who studied with him. In 1834 Abovian visited his cousin Maria (daughter of melik Sahak Aghamalian) in St. Petersburg, then married to the Georgian Prince Alexander. Prior to graduation, Abovian learned his mother Takuhi had died.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009, Vijender {{accompanied}} by Sushil and boxer Mary Kom were garlanded with the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award—India's highest sporting honour. It {{was the first}} time that three sportspeople were picked for the award; the award selection committee decided to grant the award to all of them, taking into consideration their performance for the cycle of 2008–09. Kom and Vijender were the first boxers to get the award which carried prize money of Rs 750,000 and a citation. Both Sushil and Vijender were recommended to the Padma Shri awards committee, by the Indian Sports and Home Ministries; however, they were denied the awards after recommendations were not <b>fruitful</b> by the Padma Awards Committee for 2009 winners. The denial of Padma Shri for them created a furore among masses with allegations of promoting only a few sports. Vijender later took up a job with the Haryana Police department which paid him Rs 14,000 per month.|$|E
5|$|In the 1925–26 season Johnson {{reached the}} 20 goal mark {{for the first}} time, despite playing in a side {{struggling}} {{at the bottom of}} the division. Though the team endured a difficult league season, some of their wins were high scoring, including a record 6–1 Manchester derby win in which Johnson made a goalscoring appearance. The FA Cup proved a <b>fruitful</b> competition for the club that season, as they reached the final, scoring 31 goals in six matches. Johnson played in every cup match, scoring his first competitive hat-trick in the quarter-final, against Clapton Orient. However, Johnson's appearance at Wembley was not a happy one, his Manchester City team losing the final 1–0 to Bolton Wanderers. To compound the disappointment, City lost their final league game and were relegated to the Second Division. Three weeks after the end of the season Johnson made his debut for England, scoring in a 5–3 win against Belgium. Johnson played 5 times for England and scored five goals.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, Delius began a <b>fruitful</b> {{association}} with German supporters of his music, the conductors Hans Haym, Fritz Cassirer and Alfred Hertz at Elberfeld, and Julius Buths at Düsseldorf. Haym conducted Over the Hills and Far Away, which he gave under its German title Über die Berge in die Ferne on 13 November 1897, {{believed to be}} the first time Delius's music was heard in Germany. In 1899 Hertz gave a Delius concert in St. James's Hall in London, which included Over the Hills and Far Away, a choral piece, Mitternachtslied, and excerpts from the opera Koanga. This occasion was an unusual opportunity for an unknown composer at a time when any sort of orchestral concert was a rare event in London. In spite of encouraging reviews, Delius's orchestral music was not heard again in an English concert hall until 1907.|$|E
5|$|Merit can {{be gained}} {{in a number}} of ways, such as giving, virtue and mental development. In addition, there are many forms of merit-making {{described}} in ancient Buddhist texts. A similar concept of kusala (Sanskrit: kusala) is also known, which is different from merit in some details. The most <b>fruitful</b> form of merit-making is those good deeds done with regard to the Triple Gem, that is, the Buddha, his teachings, the Dhamma (Sanskrit: Dharma), and the Sangha. In Buddhist societies, a great variety of practices involving merit-making has grown throughout the centuries, sometimes involving great self-sacrifice. Merit has become part of rituals, daily and weekly practice, and festivals. In addition, there is a widespread custom of transferring merit to one's deceased relatives, of which the origin is still a matter of scholarly debate. Merit has been that important in Buddhist societies, that kingship was often legitimated through it, and still is.|$|E
5|$|Nutter then {{enjoyed a}} <b>fruitful</b> two-year spell at Grays Athletic, and {{was part of}} the side that won the Conference South title, as well as two FA Trophy successes. In May 2006, he signed for Stevenage Borough, and again tasted FA Trophy success during the 2006–07 season. Nutter moved back into the Football League in November 2007, signing for Gillingham. He spent three-and-a-half seasons there, with the club moving between League One and League Two during his tenure. He was {{released}} when his contract expired {{at the end of the}} 2010–11 campaign, subsequently signing for Lincoln City of the Conference National in July 2011. He was loaned out to Woking in November 2012, a move that was later made permanent in January 2013.|$|E
5|$|Once the badnjak has burnt through, the thicker end {{is often}} {{taken out of}} the fire and used {{according}} to the local custom. It may be carried around the beehives, extinguished, and placed between the branches of a young plum or apple tree. The men may make crosses from it and put them under the eaves, on the fields, meadows, vineyards, and apiaries, so that the coming year may be happy and <b>fruitful.</b> It may also be set aside for next Christmas Eve, to be placed on the fire immediately before the new badnjak, as a symbol of continuity. In Kosovo, a part of the badnjak is preserved and burned again on New Years Day and Epiphany.|$|E
5|$|The Montreal Laboratory {{had been}} a <b>fruitful</b> and {{successful}} international venture, although the Canadians had on occasion been resentful of British actions that were perceived as high-handed and insensitive. One such action came in November 1945 when the British government suddenly announced that Cockcroft {{had been a}}ppointed {{the head of the}} new Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Britain without any prior consultation {{and at a time when}} the NRX reactor was still under construction. Cockcroft did not depart Canada until September 1946, but it was a sure sign of waning British interest in collaboration with Canada. The British suggested he be replaced by the British physicist Bennett Lewis, who was eventually appointed, but only after the Canadian-born Walter Zinn turned the job down.|$|E
5|$|The {{rocks in}} Glacier National Park {{are the best}} {{preserved}} Proterozoic sedimentary rocks in the world, {{with some of the}} world's most <b>fruitful</b> sources for records of early life. Sedimentary rocks of similar age located in other regions have been greatly altered by mountain building and other metamorphic changes; consequently fossils are less common and more difficult to observe. The rocks in the park preserve such features as millimeter-scale lamination, ripple marks, mud cracks, salt-crystal casts, raindrop impressions, oolites, and other sedimentary bedding characteristics. Six fossilized species of Stromatolites, early organisms consisting of primarily blue-green algae, have been documented and dated at about 1billion years. The discovery of the Appekunny Formation, a well preserved rock stratum in the park, pushed back the established date for the origination of animal life a full billion years. This rock formation has bedding structures which are believed to be the remains of the earliest identified metazoan (animal) life on Earth.|$|E
