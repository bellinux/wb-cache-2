25|$|Russell and Alfred North Whitehead wrote their three-volume Principia Mathematica {{hoping to}} achieve what Frege {{had been unable to}} do. They sought to banish the paradoxes of naive set theory by {{employing}} a theory of types they devised for this purpose. While they succeeded in grounding arithmetic in a fashion, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> evident that they did so by purely logical means. While Principia Mathematica avoided the known paradoxes and allows the derivation of a great deal of mathematics, its system gave rise to new problems.|$|E

25|$|However, incursions by Christian armies deep in Muslim {{territory}} {{were not}} unheard-of. Alfonso VII had directed expeditions that had reached Cordoba and Seville, {{well beyond the}} limits of Castillian dominions, and in 1147 he managed to conquer the Mediterranean port of Almería, south of Granada. This was possible because the largest Almoravid armies were positioned at the frontier, while armies stationed in small towns would rather retreat into their castles than face a strong enemy force. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> unfeasible that Afonso lead a raid into the Gharb, and then, while retreating, was intercepted by sizable Almoravid troops intending to crush his army.|$|E
25|$|Minkowski {{had been}} {{concerned}} {{with the state of}} electrodynamics after Michelson's disruptive experiments at least since the summer of 1905, when Minkowski and David Hilbert led an advanced seminar attended by notable physicists of the time to study the papers of Lorentz, Poincaré et al. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> clear when Minkowski began to formulate the geometric formulation of special relativity that was to bear his name, or to which extent he was influenced by Poincaré's four-dimensional interpretation of the Lorentz transformation. Nor is it clear if he ever fully appreciated Einstein's critical contribution {{to the understanding of the}} Lorentz transformations, thinking of Einstein's work as being an extension of Lorentz's work.|$|E
25|$|Currently several {{competing}} {{theories about}} the evolutionary origin of language coexist, none of them having achieved a general consensus. Researchers of language acquisition in primates and humans such as Michael Tomasello and Talmy Givón, argue that the innatist framework has understated the role of imitation in learning and that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> necessary to posit {{the existence of an}} innate grammar module to explain human language acquisition. Tomasello argues that studies of how children and primates actually acquire communicative skills suggests that humans learn complex behavior through experience, so that instead of a module specifically dedicated to language acquisition, language is acquired by the same cognitive mechanisms that are used to acquire all other kinds of socially transmitted behavior.|$|E

25|$|As in Egypt and {{the eastern}} Mediterranean, {{radiocarbon}} dates run one or two centuries earlier than the dates proposed by archaeologists. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> clear which group is right, if either. Mechanisms have been proposed for explaining why radiocarbon dates in the region might be skewed. Equally logical arguments have been made suggesting that the archaeological dates are too late. Time will tell. The spread of accelerator based carbon dating techniques may help clear up the issue. Another promising front is the dating of lime plaster from structures. Recently, radiocarbon dates from the final destruction of Ebla {{have been shown to}} definitely favour the middle chronology (with the fall of Babylon and Aleppo at c. 1595 BCE), and do not seem to fall with the ultra-low chronology (same event at c. 1499 BCE), although it is emphasized that this is not {{to be seen as a}} decisive argument.|$|E
500|$|Although it {{is often}} taken for granted, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> clear how one can infer the {{validity}} of a general statement {{from a number of}} specific instances or infer the truth of a theory from a series of successful tests. For example, a chicken observes that each morning the farmer comes and gives it food, for hundreds of days in a row. The chicken may therefore use inductive reasoning to infer that the farmer will bring food every morning. However, one morning, the farmer comes and kills the chicken. How is scientific reasoning more trustworthy than the chicken's reasoning? ...|$|E
500|$|The special has {{received}} positive critical reception. In talking about Resnick {{with regards to}} the special, Baltimore City Paper Baynard Woods wrote that it [...] "combines the traditional kind-of-creepy positivity of the infomercial host with the creepy techno-utopian positivity of a TED Talk's technologist." [...] He ultimately opined that the humor derived from [...] "the disconnect between what Resnick claims—that his avatar is a complete backup of himself—and the reality that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> like him and is, in fact, extremely limited." [...] Ezra Lefko of What Weekly, another Baltimore-based publication, praised the special. In particular, he expressed his approval of seeing [...] "success and national exposure for these talented artists."

George Lippard {{wrote in the}} Citizen Soldier that the story was [...] "characterised by thrilling {{interest}} and a graphic though sketchy power of description.

[...] Graham's Magazine printed a review in 1845 which called the story [...] "quite remarkable as an instance of intellectual acuteness and subtlety of reasoning". Thomas Dunn English wrote in the Aristidean in October 1845 that [...] "The Gold-Bug" [...] probably had a greater circulation than any other American story and [...] "perhaps it is the most ingenious story Mr. POE has written; but... <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> comparable to the 'Tell-tale Heart'—and more especially to 'Ligeia'".

500|$|Five {{nitrogen}} fluorides are known. Nitrogen trifluoride (NF3, first {{prepared in}} 1928) is a colourless and odourless gas that is thermodynamically stable, and most readily {{produced by the}} electrolysis of molten ammonium fluoride dissolved in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. Like carbon tetrafluoride, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> reactive and is stable in water or dilute aqueous acids or alkalis. Only when heated does it act as a fluorinating agent, and it reacts with copper, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth on contact at high temperatures to give tetrafluorohydrazine (N2F4). The cations [...] and [...] are also known (the latter from reacting tetrafluorohydrazine with strong fluoride-acceptors such as arsenic pentafluoride), as is ONF3, which has aroused interest due to the short N–O distance implying partial double bonding and the highly polar and long N–F bond. Tetrafluorohydrazine, unlike hydrazine itself, can dissociate at room temperature and above to give the radical NF2•. Fluorine azide (FN3) is very explosive and thermally unstable. Dinitrogen difluoride (N2F2) exists as thermally interconvertible cis and trans isomers, and was first found {{as a product of}} the thermal decomposition of FN3.|$|E

2500|$|One {{idea for}} {{defining}} a Weil cohomology theory {{of a variety}} X over a field k of characteristic p [...] is to 'lift' it to a variety X* over the ring of Witt vectors of k (that gives back X on reduction mod p), then take the de Rham cohomology of this lift.

2500|$|The Rite for Reconciliation of Several Penitents with General Confession and Absolution — {{is similar}} to the second, except that the penitents do not make an actual confession, but only {{manifest}} contrition (general confession).

The penitents are obliged to actually confess each grave sin in their next confession. This form is intended for emergencies and other situations when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> possible for the priest(s) to hear all the individual confessions.

2500|$|Internal party disunity {{compounded}} {{the difficulty}} of identifying lawmakers who might have informally functioned as a minority leader.

[...] With so many candidates competing for the speakership, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> clear {{that one of the}} defeated lawmakers then assumed the mantle of [...] "minority leader." [...] The Democratic minority from 1861 to 1875 was so completely disorganized that they did not [...] "nominate a candidate for Speaker in two of these seven Congresses and nominated no man more than once in the other five.
