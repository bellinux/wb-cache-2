5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} on May 3, 2006, The New York Times addressed the controversy. The paper acknowledged that the mainstream media—itself included—had been criticized for focusing on Bush's act with Bridges while ignoring Colbert's speech. The paper then quoted several passages of Colbert's more substantial criticism {{of the president and}} discussed various reactions to the event. On May 15, The New York Times public editor, Byron Calame, wrote on his blog that more than two hundred readers had written to complain about the exclusion of any mention of Colbert from the paper's initial lengthy article covering the dinner. Calame quoted his deputy bureau chief in Washington, who said that a mention of Colbert in the first article could not have been long enough to do <b>his</b> <b>routine</b> justice. But he also noted that the paper should have printed an in-depth article specifically covering Colbert's speech in the same issue, rather than waiting until days after the fact.|$|E
5|$|Other notable {{performances}} {{came from}} Berger, {{who took the}} final podium position despite being delayed during one of <b>his</b> <b>routine</b> pit stops due to {{a problem with a}} loose wheel nut; Mika Häkkinen, who finished fourth for the McLaren team despite its new car proving to be uncompetitive in pre-season testing; and Mika Salo, who drove strongly {{in the first half of}} the race to run third in his first Grand Prix for the Tyrrell team, only to suffer from a cramp and drop back to seventh place at the finish. Behind Häkkinen, the other points-scoring finishers were Jean Alesi in the second Ferrari and Mark Blundell, who drove the second McLaren. Blundell was standing in for regular driver Nigel Mansell in the second McLaren until the team could produce a wider chassis in which to accommodate him, as the car's initial cockpit design had proved to be too narrow for him to drive comfortably.|$|E
5|$|Sol and Naz {{spend the}} night {{together}} but at later dance rehearsals, Asher gives Naz her necklace back, and Sol sees this. He confronts Naz about it and she reveals she had a one-night stand with Asher but it meant nothing to her. Sol punches Asher, saying his brother has betrayed him, and a fight breaks out, but is broken up by Skolla and the other dancers. Skolla tells Sol and Asher they are both out {{of the group and}} reveals that Asher bought Sol's place. Sol goes back home to his mother but a neighbour tells him she has been taken away. Back in Walford, Naz insists she did not receive Sol's text message but he is still angry. Stevie attempts to get them to reconcile by locking them in the flat and pretending to swallow the key, but Naz reveals she is going to Turkey to meet Ekin's family and Sol says she can stay there. Sol and Naz get close again but Asher interrupts them when he returns drunk. Stevie drops the key revealing she did not swallow it and Sol thinks Naz was in on the plan so he tells her to enjoy Turkey before leaving. Asher finds Sol with their mother in hospital, and tells Sol he is better off with him than their mother as she is schizophrenic and has stabbed Asher. Sol says Asher is the problem and leaves. Asher finds him and apologises for Naz and says she did not get Sol's text message because he deleted it, and tells Sol that Naz loves him and he should do something about it. Sol returns to Walford again as Naz is leaving, and stops Ekin's car. Naz gets out and they kiss. Asher tells him he can dance at the dance-off, but when his name is called, he is unsure and calls for Asher, saying he needs him. Asher tells him he can do it on his own. Everyone cheers him after <b>his</b> <b>routine</b> and he is called one of the best dancers.|$|E

25|$|Griswold & Nissen worked {{together}} to develop the first prototype trampoline. Later {{they set up a}} company, the Griswold-Nissen Trampoline & Tumbling Company, to manufacture trampolines. However, initially sales were slow and Griswold sold out as his entertainment career was starting to thrive. In 1945, he found that he had to limit his immersion in water for health reasons and so changed <b>his</b> <b>routine</b> to use a trampoline disguised as a swimming pool in his diving act. This allowed him to play a wider variety of venues.|$|E
25|$|He {{had a great}} {{appreciation}} of sacred music and was a great reader of works about art, but he detested physical activity. He appeared to have suffered periodic crises of depression. An aversion to changes in <b>his</b> <b>routine</b> extended to his clothing: he wore the same coat until it tore, forcing his chamberlains to sew it on his body while he slept in it. He suffered from panic attacks when he heard thunder, staying in his rooms with the windows shut and receiving no one.|$|E

25|$|His fellow captives {{included}} many political prisoners, who {{were forced to}} perform hard labour for many years. Reunited with his brother Ganesh, the Savarkars nevertheless struggled in the harsh environment: Forced to arise at 5am, tasks including cutting trees and chopping wood, and working at the oil mill under regimental strictness, with talking amidst prisoners strictly prohibited during mealtime. Prisoners were subject to frequent mistreatment and torture. Contact {{with the outside world}} and home was restricted to the writing and mailing of one letter a year. In these years, Savarkar withdrew within himself and performed <b>his</b> <b>routine</b> tasks mechanically. Obtaining permission to start a rudimentary jail library, Savarkar would also teach some fellow convicts to read and write.|$|E
25|$|At 6:00am, {{one of the}} assassins, Hamdi Quran, went to {{the dining}} room of the hotel to make sure that Minister Ze'evi would indeed be there in {{accordance}} with <b>his</b> <b>routine</b> schedule. At 06:20am Ze'evi and his wife Yael went down {{to the dining room}} of the hotel. When Quran noticed the minister was in a dining hall, he immediately went back to the room where the assassins were staying and updated his associates. As a result, two assailants headed towards their vehicle, which was parked in the hotel's basement parking lot, to fetch their pistols which were modified with silencers. In order not to raise suspicion, the two assailants returned separately back to their room through the staircase instead of the elevator.|$|E
25|$|Temple {{had already}} {{appeared}} in five films released in 1934, and had performed a tap routine with James Dunn in Stand Up and Cheer! After Robinson {{was signed by}} 20th Century Fox, {{it was decided that}} he would perform his famous stair dance with Temple. While Robinson liked the idea, he quickly realized that he could not teach his complex stair dance to a seven-year-old in the few days permitted by the shooting schedule. Instead, he taught Temple to kick the riser (face) of each stairstep with her toe. After watching her practice his choreography, Robinson modified <b>his</b> <b>routine</b> to mimic her movements, so that it appeared on film that she was imitating his steps. The sequence was the highlight of the film.|$|E

5000|$|While Gardner did spin {{routines}} {{based on}} a wide-ranging social freedom, some of his material did play off racial stereotypes of his time. Often, he had African-American characters in <b>his</b> <b>routines</b> speak with an exaggerated, high-pitched, Butterfly McQueen-style accent in style of Flip Wilson, as in [...] "The Motorcycle Story." [...] In another of <b>his</b> <b>routines,</b> a black woman exclaimed, [...] "James Lewis, git away from dat wheelbarrow -- say, you know you doesn't know nothin' 'bout machin'ry!" [...] Although Gardner's early-1960s albums for RCA Victor contained questionable racial humor, {{there is nothing like}} the overtly racist content of his late-1960s act.|$|R

25|$|Like {{his father}} Lowther (a water drinker for his health's sake {{since at least}} 1701) {{suffered}} from gout, and from 1726 onwards {{he seems to have}} had a bad attack nearly every winter. In 1750, the attack was particularly severe and ensuing complications led to the amputation of his right leg. Lowther (just turned seventy-seven) survived the operation and (once the stump was healed, and wooden leg fitted) resumed <b>his</b> <b>routine</b> of spending nine months of the year in London (maintaining effective control of his mines by frequent correspondence with his steward) but the summer in Whitehaven. He died in London early in January 1755 and was buried in Whitehaven in Holy Trinity church, which he had been instrumental in founding in 1715.|$|E
25|$|Sparky the Sun Devil is the mascot of Arizona State University and {{was named}} by vote {{of the student body}} on November 8, 1946. Sparky often travels with the team across the country and has been at every {{football}} bowl game in which the university has participated. The university's mascot is {{not to be confused with}} the athletics department's logo, the Pitchfork or hand gesture used by those associated with the university. The new logo is used on various sport facilities, uniforms and athletics documents. Arizona State Teacher’s College had a different mascot and the sports teams were known as the Owls and later, the Bulldogs. When the school was first established, the Tempe Normal School’s teams were simply known as the Normals. Sparky is visible on the sidelines of every home game played in Sun Devil Stadium or other ASU athletic facilities. <b>His</b> <b>routine</b> at football games includes pushups after every touchdown scored by the Sun Devils. He is aided by Sparky's Crew, male yell leaders that must meet physical requirements to participate as members. The female members are known as the Spirit Squad and are categorized into a dance line and spirit line. They are the official squad that represents ASU. The spirit squad competes every year at the ESPN Universal Dance Association (UDA) College Nationals in the Jazz and Hip-Hop categories. They were chosen by the UDA to represent the USA at the World Dance Championship 2013 in the Jazz category. Currently, ASU's varsity intercollegiate cheerleading team is not allowed to participate at athletic events (e.g. football and basketball games) due to dismissal regarding prior misconduct. ASU Cheerleading has since become a club sport, through the Student Recreation Center, competing locally and nationally as a Collegiate Co-Ed Division IA-Level VI team. They have reestablished their commitment to excellence, winning various championships. The team has a strict code of conduct and is seeking reinstatement from the university to participate at athletic events.|$|E

There were several anthems and two more technically assured multi-sectioned verse anthems, [...] "Drop down, ye heavens from above" [...] and [...] "They were lovely and pleasant in their lives". <b>His</b> <b>routine</b> included two services daily, rehearsals, lectures, tutorials, attendance at Ouseley's lectures, and visits home to Southwark in the vacations. He must have performed his duties with diligence as his salary was raised by £10 a year and after 1862 he received an allowance towards his rent.|$|E
