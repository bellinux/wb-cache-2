40|$|A {{framework}} for the identification and monitoring of forest clearcuts and their regeneration is presented. LANDSAT digital data are classified to detect clearcuts and their major regeneration components, including brush, grass, bare soil, and conifer. Historical LANDSAT digital data are used to provide a change detection analysis of forest conditions. Area summaries of land cover are obtained for the entire study area or for subunits. A <b>graphic</b> <b>digitizer</b> is used to provide an overlay to the LANDSAT, digital land cover classification in order to summarize land cover area by physical and/or political boundaries. Individual clearcuts are analyzed within each summary unit for {{the size of the}} clearcut, the type of regenerated land cover, and other site-specific accounting information; Output products include tabular summaries of the area of each land cover, and black and white or color maps of geographically referenced land cover data. Ancillary data affecting land cover management decision-making, such as topography or climate can be graphically interfaced with LANDSAT-derived land cover information and 2 ̆ 2 specialized 2 ̆ 2 composite maps produced. These 2 ̆ 2 specialized 2 ̆ 2 maps provide an added dimension in resource management planning...|$|E
40|$|Whiplash {{injury is}} a common and {{troublesome}} disorder and approximately 10 - 40 per cent of its victims develop chronic symptoms. The annual incidence is estimated at 1 / 1000 inhabitants and the prevalence at 1 %. The cause of chronic symptoms after whiplash injury is still unknown and no effective treatment has been presented so far. The present study {{is divided into two}} parts; the first part includes clinical, radiographic and psychological investigations, and the second part the effect of surgical intervention as well as intervention with medication. MRI studies (n= 39) showed a larger proportion of pathologic findings compared to normal subjects, but no correlation with initial neurologic deficits was found. At the 2 -year follow-up all patients with disc herniations with medullary impingement had persistent symptoms. Three patients had disc herniations that deteriorated from slight and moderate initial changes on the MRI to severe changes with medullary cord impingement. This deterioration might be a first sign of disc degeneration. Thus our results indicate that disc pathology is a contributing factor in the development of chronic symptoms. Measurements from standard lateral radiographs taken in neutral position were evaluated (n= 48). A <b>graphic</b> <b>digitizer</b> connected to a microcomputer was used and the sagittal diameters were determined. Multivariate analysis of variance showed that the spinal canal was significantly smaller in patients with persistent symptoms indicating that a narrow spinal canal is unfavourable in patients subjected to whiplash injury. A psychological investigation (n= 70) revealed no relationship between pre-existing personality traits and persistent symptoms. In our study, whiplash patients showed no differences in personality traits compared to normal controls. Our results after discectomy and anterior cervical fusion (n= 20) because of chronic symptoms after whiplash injury were not satisfactory. We noticed that about half of the cases had less headache and neck pain but no beneficial effects on radicular pain, vertigo, visual and auditory symptoms were observed. Based on the criteria of a surgical evaluation, two patients were classified as good, nine as fair and nine as poor. A prospective randomised double-blind study of high-dose methyl-prednisolone compared to placebo was conducted (n= 40). A clinical follow-up with repeated neurological examinations and a standardised questionnaire including VAS-scales and a pain sketch form were used for the evaluation of initial symptoms, before drug administration and at the follow-ups at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 6 months after the injury. At the 6 -month follow-up {{there was a significant difference}} between the actively treated patients and placebo concerning disabling symptoms defined as inability to return to previous work, number of sick-days and sick-leave profile. All the actively treated patients had returned to work and none had multiple symptoms though three of them complained of intermittent neck pain. Our conclusion is therefore that acute treatment with high-dose corticosteroids might be beneficial to the prevention of disabling symptoms after whiplash injury.

40|$|We {{developed}} an out-patients data handling system utilizing a microcomputer (MCP) which enables physicians to input the {{data obtained from}} out-patients simultaneously (on real-time) and take out necessary data when required. MZ- 80 B with 2 KB ROM (read only memory) and 64 KB RAM (random access memory) were used for MCP. A 1. 12 MB registration disc device, MZ- 80 FD, and dot printer MZ- 80 BP 5 were also installed. The data to be input are basic information about the patient (patients name and 4 other items), past history, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment and prescription. The input data are processed by the programs made for disease statistics, age-sex statistics access to patient's cards classified by disease, drugs used, symptoms and urinary findings. By employing this system, access to patient's data was speeded up and quality of examination and treatment was improved and standardized. In the future MCP data handling system will be further improved by introducing the multi-system approach and introducing various terminal devices such as a <b>graphic</b> display and <b>digitizer...</b>|$|R
50|$|The first {{devices to}} {{accurately}} record handwriting {{that could be}} connected to computers were <b>graphics</b> tablet, or <b>digitizer,</b> x-y-tablet, <b>graphics</b> pad, with electronic pens {{as we know them}} today. Among the earliest tablets are theStyalator electronic tablet with pen for computer input and handwriting recognition in 1957 and the commercial products by Vector General. The Vector General products reported the position of the stylus at 100 Hz and claimed an accuracy of 0.1 cm. Typical tablets sense the position of the pen electromagnetically. Touch-sensitive tablets cannot be used when the hand is resting on the tablet unless they implement some form of hand rejection. Tablets can have a display built in (e.g., as in a tablet PC). Still today, handwriting tablets are the gold standard to record handwriting. Sampling rates used to be 100 Hz until it was decided that the minimum rate for Human Input Devices HID should be at least 133 Hz, bumping the sampling rates up to 133 - 200 Hz. The advantage is a 15%-40% reduction of device noise and quantization noise. The digitizer technology belongs to the most accurate and cost-effective pointing devices. Dynamic accuracy of 0.01 cm at constant frequency is achievable. Opaque tablets are produced by Wacom who also produces display digitizers, Euronovate SA, Hanvon, VisTablet, Adesso, Genius.|$|R
