It is likely that the tape, when removed, will peel away layers of the <b>floor’s</b> <b>surface</b> <b>finish.</b> Most tapes promoted for temporary markings have a different coefficient of friction than finishes applied to the maple playing surface, and can impact a person’s ability to start, stop and pivot. Removing the surface paint/finish and exposing the maple can result in additional chipping and peeling of the remaining paint/finish in adjacent areas.|$|R

40|$|Hollowcore slabs {{are used}} in floors and roofs of residential, commercial, {{industrial}} and institutional buildings. They are precast/prestressed concrete elements produced using the extrusion process. Their <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> can be “machine-cast” or “intentionally roughened”. A typical floor consists {{of a number of}} hollowcore slabs that are connected together. Prestressing causes hollowcore slabs to camber, which results in an uneven <b>floor</b> <b>surface.</b> A 50 mm topping concrete is commonly cast to level the <b>floor</b> <b>surface.</b> To avoid delamination, engineers require bonding agents to be applied on the hollowcore slab surface before pouring the topping concrete. The concrete topping can be used compositely with the hollowcore slabs to increase the floor’s load carrying capacity. However, North American design standards require intentional roughening of the hollowcore slab surface to consider such composite action. This requirement results in added cost that manufacturers are keen to avoid. This thesis presents a comprehensive experimental program to assess the performance of composite hollowcore slabs with machine-cast and lightly-roughened <b>surface</b> <b>finishes.</b> Three types of tests were performed: pull-off, push-off and full-scale. They provided an overall understanding of the interfacial shear and peel behaviors at the interface between hollowcore slabs and the topping concrete. The tested slabs were found to sustain higher interfacial shear stresses than the limits set by the design standards and to provide adequate composite behavior up to failure. Linear analytical modeling in which closed-form solutions for differential equations governing the interfacial shear and peel stresses during the push-off tests was conducted. Two analytical methods were developed to estimate the shear and peel stresses during the full-scale tests utilizing the interface stiffness determined from the pushoff tests. Linear finite element analysis was performed to validate and compare the proposed methods. To better understand the experimental results and to provide engineers with more accurate tools for estimating the interfacial stresses, nonlinear finite element analysis of the push-off and the full-scale tests were conducted. Interfacial shear and peel stiffness values associated with the tested slabs were also determined to assist design engineers in predicting failure modes of composite hollowcore slab...|$|R

The quality of <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> was studied at various cutting parameters and at the two extreme stages of the machining process, i. e. {{at the beginning and}} end of the process. The objective is to evaluate the effect of a worn-out tool on the quality of <b>surface</b> <b>finish.</b> PVD-coated carbide tools were used in this study. Experiments were conducted at two cutting speeds, 35 and 55 m/min, two depths of cut, 0. 2 and 0. 25 mm, and a constant pitch of 2. 0 mm. The tool wear and the quality of <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> were inspected visually by microscope. The tool’s flank wear was measured gradually and machining was stopped when the flank wear reached the rejection criterion of 0. 3 mm. The microstructure beneath the machined surface was also evaluated. It was found that, at the beginning of machining, there was only a feed mark on the <b>surface</b> <b>finish.</b> When the machining was prolonged until the tools reached the rejection criterion, a bad <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> was produced. Metal debris, surface cavities and a boundary crack were observed. Results show that machining with a worn-out tool can cause microstructure alteration beneath the machined surface. The selection of cutting parameters and monitoring of tool wear are crucial in order to obtain a good <b>surface</b> <b>finish.</b> Characterization of the <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> with respect to the threading process under a dry condition would ultimately help in the development of suitable parameters for machining titanium-based alloys. <b>Surface</b> <b>finish,</b> microstructure, dry machining...|$|R

40|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>finish</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} parameters to be controlled during machining as it affects many functional properties of components. It can be effected by workpiece and cutting tool material, geometry cutting fluid, and cutting conditions. When machining at low cutting speeds a cutting fluid with good lubricant propel ties is often recommended to improve <b>surface</b> <b>finish.</b> This improvement is often thought to affect built up edge (BUE) formation, which is a major cause of poor <b>surface</b> <b>finish.</b> This work studies the effect of sulphur; an extreme pressure (EP) additive, in an oil lubricant on the <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> of an AISI 1040 steel machined with a cemented carbide cutting tool.
