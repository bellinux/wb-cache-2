5|$|The USPTO will {{contact the}} senior {{registrant}} to inform that {{party of the}} claim against their mark. The proceeding in which the respective rights of the parties are determined is like a trial in which the applicant must submit evidence showing that the applicant had adopted the mark in good faith, that the applicant had adopted the mark prior to the senior registrant's date of registration, and that the confusion is not likely. The senior registrant may present evidence to the contrary, {{in order to prevent}} the loss of control over the use of the registered mark in the applicant's claimed territory. Both parties may take discovery in the form of requests for admission, <b>interrogatories,</b> requests for production, and depositions. As with a regular trial, the TTAB may be called upon to resolve disputes over whether discovery requests are overbroad, and whether discovery responses are inadequate.|$|E
25|$|Mandamus is {{the remedy}} where {{a lower court}} has clearly failed to issue {{compulsion}} to produce documents, or to allow the petitioner access to such documents as {{may be in the}} possession of the court or the parties to the action.

2500|$|His beatification cause {{commenced}} in Detroit in 1976 with {{an investigation}} involving witness <b>interrogatories</b> and the compiling of documentation. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome validated this phase on November 7, 1986; around 1995, it received the Positio dossier from postulation officials. The theological advisors approved the dossier on April 7, 1995, and the cardinal and bishop {{members of the}} Congregation did so on June 20, 1995.

2500|$|It is {{apparent}} {{from the text}} of the subpoena itself that the prosecutor needed respondent's assistance both to identify potential sources of information and to produce those sources.... Given the breadth of the description of the 11 categories of documents called for by the subpoena, the collection and production [...] of the materials demanded was tantamount to answering a series of <b>interrogatories</b> asking a witness [...] to disclose the existence and location of particular documents fitting certain broad descriptions. The assembly of literally hundreds of pages of material in response to a request for [...] "any and all documents reflecting, referring, or relating to any direct or indirect sources of money or other things of value received by or provided to" [...] an individual or members of his family during a 3-year period ... is the functional equivalent of the preparation of an answer to either a detailed written interrogatory or a series of oral questions at a discovery deposition. Entirely apart from the contents of the 13,120 pages of materials that respondent produced in this case, it is undeniable that providing a catalog of existing documents fitting within any of the 11 broadly worded subpoena categories could provide a prosecutor with a [...] "lead to incriminating evidence," [...] or [...] "a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute." ...|$|E

2500|$|An immense mass {{of people}} {{assembled}} in the Free Trade Hall [...] on the 16 September 1876, to hear a lecture from Mr. John O'Connor Power, MP, on a non-political subject. The chair was taken by Mr. J. G. Biggar, MP. On rising to introduce the lecturer, he soon discerned that trouble was impending, that there was, so to say, [...] "a storm in the offing." [...] An [...] "Advanced" [...] person, a Mr. Flesh of Ramsbottom, came on the Platform and informed him that {{at a meeting of}} Nationalists held on the previous evening, it was decided that the lecture might be allowed to proceed only on the condition that the lecturer should first answer satisfactorily a series of questions which had been drawn up for him. The main purpose of those <b>interrogatories</b> was to ascertain whether he held and was prepared to support the principles of Wolfe Tone, Lord Edward Fitzgerald, and Robert Emmet. The chairman said those questions were not in order, as the lecture was to be on a non-political subject; however, he would leave it to the lecturer to deal with the queries as he thought fit, Mr. O'Connor Power then came to the front and said, amidst much noise, that with regard to the questions that had been read, his view was identical with that of the chairman. He begged leave to point out – He could say no more: the platform was rushed; there was a smashing of chairs and tables, a noise of heavy blows, and of fierce exclamations from men engaged in close combat, mingled with the shouts and screams of women, while blood flowed freely from many wounded persons ... The subject of Mr. O'Connor Power's intended lecture was [...] "Irish Wit and Humour".|$|E

6000|$|At Freeport I {{answered}} several <b>interrogatories</b> {{that had}} been propounded to me by Judge Douglas at the Ottawa meeting.

In my answers, which have been printed, and all {{have had the opportunity}} of seeing, I take the ground that those who elect me must expect that I will do nothing which will not be in accordance with those answers. I have some right to assert that Judge Douglas has no fault to find with them. But he chooses to still try to thrust me upon different ground, without paying any attention to my answers, the obtaining of which from me cost him so much trouble and concern. At the same time I propounded four <b>interrogatories</b> to him, claiming it as a right that he should answer as many <b>interrogatories</b> for me as I did for him, and I would reserve myself for a future instalment when I got them ready.

60|$|Ladies and Gentlemen; On Saturday last, Judge Douglas {{and myself}} first met in public discussion. He spoke one hour, I {{an hour and}} a half, and he replied for half an hour. The order is now reversed. I am to speak an hour, he {{an hour and a}} half, and then I am to reply for half an hour. I propose to devote myself during the first hour to the scope of what was brought within the range of his half-hour speech at Ottawa. Of course, there was brought within the scope of that half-hour's speech {{something}} of his own opening speech. In the course of that opening argument Judge Douglas proposed to me seven distinct <b>interrogatories.</b> In my speech of an hour and a half, I attended to some other parts of his speech, and incidentally, as I thought, answered one of the <b>interrogatories</b> then. I then distinctly intimated to him that I would answer the rest of his <b>interrogatories</b> on condition only that he should agree to answer as many for me. He made no intimation {{at the time of the}} proposition, nor did he in his reply allude at all to that suggestion of mine. I do him no injustice in saying that he occupied at least half of his reply in dealing with me as though I had refused to answer his <b>interrogatories.</b> I now propose that I will answer any of the <b>interrogatories,</b> upon condition that he will answer questions from me not exceeding the same number. I give him an opportunity to respond. The Judge remains silent. I now say that I will answer his <b>interrogatories,</b> whether he answers mine or not; and that after I have done so, I shall propound mine to him.|$|E
