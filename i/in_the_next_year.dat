5|$|A Venetian confidant on Hvar reported, in 1498, the Ottoman {{preparation}} of 25 ships for sea attack on Krajina and Kačićs. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>year,</b> they became Ottoman subjects. In 1500, the Split monarch reported to Venice that Ottomans captured several delegates from Split, and that safely arrived in Mostar only thanks to knez Juraj Marković, an Ottoman subject and Venetian friend. Marković wrote from Makarska to Venice {{that he was}} knez for 15 years and always {{a friend of the}} Venetians. In the Marković collection and archive, D.

Setting out from Constantinople, the imperial army followed the Thracian coast into Macedonia, and then south into Thessaly, Central Greece and the Peloponnese. This expedition restored {{a measure of}} Byzantine imperial authority over these areas, and collected booty and tribute from the locals.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>year,</b> the Rockets started poorly, winning only 15 of {{the first}} 33 games amidst {{injuries}} among the star players and off-court controversies {{for the rest of}} the roster, such as Lewis Lloyd and Mitchell Wiggins getting suspended for cocaine use. The team still made the playoffs, and advanced to the second round past favored Clyde Drexler and his Portland Trail Blazers (eventually proving to be their last playoff victory until 1993), before being eliminated by the Seattle SuperSonics in Game 6, a double-overtime classic in which Olajuwon scored 49 points in the losing cause.|$|E

These paintings, completed in 1670, hung in London's Guildhall until it was bombed during World War II; today only two (those of Sir Matthew Hale and Sir Hugh Wyndham) remain in the Guildhall Art Gallery the remainder having been destroyed or dispersed.|$|E
5|$|Kingsley died <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>year,</b> while {{en route}} to New York City {{to work on a}} land deal. Anna {{returned}} to Florida in 1846 to settle an inheritance dispute with some of her husband's white relatives; because the will had been made under Spanish law, when inheritance by free blacks was legal, the court ruled in her favor and control of the Kingsley's holdings in Florida remained with her and her children for several years. Kingsley Beatty Gibbs sold the Fort George Island plantation in 1852 and moved to St Augustine.|$|E

While the Rockets {{did not make the}} playoffs, Tomjanovich's arrival was considered a step forward. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>year,</b> the Rockets improved their record by 13 games, getting the Midwest Division title, and winning their first playoff series in 6 years by defeating the Los Angeles Clippers, before an elimination by the SuperSonics in a closely contested Game 7 overtime loss.|$|E
5|$|Mt. Kenya was {{discovered}} by Krapf <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>year,</b> on December 3, 1849.

5|$|As one of Harun's younger sons, Abu Ishaq was {{initially}} of little consequence, {{and did not}} figure {{in the line of}} succession. During the civil war between his elder half-brothers al-Amin (r. 809–813) and al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833) he remained in Baghdad, and, like most members of the Abbasid dynasty and the Abbasid aristocracy (abnāʾ al-dawla), he supported the anti-caliph Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi in 817–819. Al-Tabari records that Abu Ishaq led the Hajj pilgrimage in 816, accompanied by many troops and officials, among whom was Hamdawayh ibn Ali ibn Isa ibn Maham, who had just been appointed to the governorship of the Yemen and was on his way there. During his stay in Mecca, his troops defeated and captured a pro-Alid leader who had raided the pilgrim caravans. He also led the pilgrimage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>year,</b> but no details are known.|$|E
5|$|By early 1972, {{with the}} {{monument}} to Caroline erected on Codden Hill, Thorpe was fully re-engaged in political life. In February he assisted the {{passage through the}} House of Commons of Heath's European Communities Bill, approving the United Kingdom's accession to the European Economic Community. The bill was opposed by Labour and by some Conservatives. By aligning his party with the government, Thorpe ensured a majority of eight for the bill's second reading, and it duly became law. By mid-1972 the Liberals' fortunes were rising significantly; the public was equally disenchanted with both major parties, and community politics were proving popular. Impressive local election results were followed by sensational by-election results. In October 1972 Rochdale was won from Labour, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>year</b> four victories were achieved over the Conservatives: Sutton, Isle of Ely, Ripon and Berwick-upon-Tweed.|$|E
5|$|Chaney {{was named}} the Coach of the Year for the 1990–91 season, after leading the Rockets to a 52-30 record despite Olajuwon's absence due to injury for 25 games. The Rockets were once again {{eliminated}} {{in the first round}} of the playoffs, 3–0 to the Lakers. Midway through the next season, with the Rockets' record only 26–26, Chaney was fired and replaced by one of his assistants, former Houston player Tomjanovich. Although the Rockets did not make the playoffs, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>year,</b> the Rockets won-loss record improved by 13 games, as they won 55 games. Olajuwon won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award, and the Rockets clinched the Midwest title. The playoffs started with Houston's first series victory in 5 years by defeating the Los Angeles Clippers, before an elimination by the SuperSonics during a game 7 overtime loss in one of the classic postseason series in NBA History.|$|E

5|$|Ibn Kundajiq {{initially}} accepted, but in 880/1 {{the coalition}} against him was renewed, and open warfare broke out. This time, Ibn Kundajiq was victorious {{in a battle}} fought in April/May 881, driving his opponents before him to Amid, which he left under siege. A few inconclusive skirmishes followed, and the situation was not resolved {{by the time of}} Isa's death in 882/3, as Ibn Kundajiq became involved in the Abbasid efforts to recover Syria from the Tulunids. Isa was succeeded by his son Ahmad, who ruled the Diyar Bakr as an independent prince. Ahmad expanded his territory into southern Armenia, and, after Ibn Kundajiq's death in 891/2, occupied even Mosul. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>year,</b> however, the resurgent Abbasids under Caliph al-Mu'tadid wrested the city from him, and in 899 the rest of the family's Jaziran domains from Ahmad's heir, Muhammad.|$|E
5|$|In autumn 964, Nikephoros, now emperor, campaigned in the East. Mopsuestia was besieged {{but held}} out, but Nikephoros {{returned}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>year,</b> stormed {{the city and}} deported its inhabitants. On 16 August 965, Tarsus was surrendered by its inhabitants. Cilicia became a Byzantine province, and Nikephoros re-Christianized it. Amidst rebellions and Byzantine raids {{as far as the}} Jazira, Sayf al-Dawla died at Aleppo in February 967. His son and successor, Sa'd al-Dawla, faced constant internal turmoil, and he did not secure control of his own capital until 977. By this time, the rump Emirate of Aleppo was almost powerless and became a bone of contention between the Byzantines and the new power of the Middle East, the Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>year,</b> 736, Asad's forces {{cleared the}} {{mountains}} of Upper Tokharistan from the remnants of Harith's supporters. The fortress of Tabushkhan, where many of Harith's followers and relatives had found refuge, was besieged by Juday' al-Kirmani. After they surrendered, {{most of the men}} were executed, while the rest were sold into slavery. Harith himself on the other hand continued to escape capture. In 737, Asad led his troops again north of the Oxus in a retaliatory campaign against Khuttal, whose ruler had allied himself with both Harith and the Turgesh. While the Arab troops were dispersed ravaging the countryside, the Turgesh khagan Suluk, responding to the pleas for help by the Khuttalan king, launched an attack that precipitated a headlong flight back by Asad's army across the Oxus. The Turgesh followed after them and attacked and captured the Arab baggage train on 1 October, before both sides settled for winter quarters. Harith now emerged from hiding and joined the khagan.|$|E
