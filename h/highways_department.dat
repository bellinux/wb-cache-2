Local residents were disappointed, {{and saw the}} removal {{as an example of}} the government only paying lip-service to promoting the arts in the city. In early 2015, a replica of the life-sized Hong Kong Phooey (HK 58) that had been removed, reached HK$1.96 million ($250,000) at auction at Sotheby's.

25|$|In 1921, the State Highway Board was {{replaced}} by the Washington Highway Committee and the Washington State <b>Highways</b> <b>Department</b> became a division of the Washington State Department of Public Works. The first gas tax (1¢ per gallon) was levied and Homer Hadley started planning a pontoon bridge across Lake Washington, which would later become the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge, which opened on July 2, 1940. In 1923, the State <b>Highways</b> <b>Department</b> separated from the Public Works Department and organized the first official system of highways, Washington's state road system. In 1926, the U.S. government approved the U.S. route system, which connected the country by road. 11 U.S. Routes entered Washington at the time. Later in 1929, the Highway Committee was merged with the State <b>Highways</b> <b>Department.</b> The Lake Washington Floating Bridge and the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge opened in 1940. The Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapsed because of winds on November 7, 1940, earning it the name Galloping Gertie. On June 29, 1956, President Dwight Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, which started the Interstate Highway System. Originally, 2 Interstates entered Washington.|$|E

25|$|WSDOT {{was founded}} as the Washington State Highway Board and the Washington State <b>Highways</b> <b>Department</b> on March 13, 1905, when then-governor Albert Mead {{signed a bill}} that gave $110,000 USD to fund new roads that linked the state. The State Highway Board was managed by State Treasurer, State Auditor, and Highway Commissioner Joseph M. Snow and the Board first met on April 17, 1905 to plan the 12 {{original}} state roads. The first state highway districts, each managed by a District Engineer, were established in 1918. During this period, the construction of highways began.|$|E

In 1964, the <b>Highways</b> <b>Department</b> was renamed to WSDOT and the state highways were renumbered to the current system. Metro Transit was created in 1972 and work on highways continued very fast. The North Cascades Highway (SR 20) was completed in 1972 and the first HOV lanes in Washington were installed on SR 520 in 1972. The Washington State Transportation Commission was established in 1977 and the first meeting was held on September 21, 1977.|$|E

The road was to relieve the higher traffic traveling through Tsing Yi, especially with the new Hong Kong International Airport and developments in Lantau being built. The project included the road and its ramps, pedestrian pathways, noise barriers around the highway, surveillance system, and a maintenance centre in Tsing Yi. The <b>Highways</b> <b>Department</b> signed a contract with Gammon Construction Limited for HKD$775.6 million in February 1999, after it invited qualified contractors in October 1998.

Coimbatore bypass {{is a series of}} bypasses connecting the various national highways and Sstate highways passing through and originating from Coimbatore. The first section of the bypass, a [...] stretch from Neelambur to Madukkarai on National Highway 544 opened for traffic in 2000. It was the first road privatisation project to be implemented on a build–operate–transfer model in South India. In 2008, the State <b>Highways</b> <b>department</b> came up with a proposal to create a Ring road to help de-congest the main arterial roads and the 12km road would extend from Peelamedu to Mettupalayam road. In 2011, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu announced the construction of two new flyovers at Ukkadam and Athupalam to help de-congest the Palakkad Road.

500|$|One of {{the last}} large land {{purchases}} was that of Ross Thiem in the 1940s. A club member, C.W.

The then <b>Highways</b> <b>Department</b> also acquired land in 1951, buying [...] of land above Beaumont for future transport planning. Thiem's land was eventually sold in the 1950s, to the Rossdale Property Co. Their subsequent attempts at selling the land were just as fruitless as those before, and once again the property changed hands to the Mount Osmond Heights Pty Ltd. The land was newly subdivided, and it was in the late 1960s that finally much of Mount Osmond was sold to residential buyers. Fifty-two out of the 116 new sites had been sold by 12 October 1968 at an average of $3,500, according to the Adelaide daily The Advertiser. Since the land sales of that era, Mount Osmond has developed slowly because of the scarcity of land and the housing and development restrictions of the Hills Face Zone. Now the suburb is home to large, extravagant, tree-filled houses and properties. With the upgrade of Mount Barker Road {{to become part of the}} South Eastern Freeway from 1997, Mount Osmond received its own freeway interchange as part of the development.|$|E
500|$|A plan to {{relocate}} US31 in Berrien County, Michigan, existed {{as early as}} 1952. Planning to extend the South Bend Bypass northward into Michigan as a bypass of Niles began in 1967. A report issued in 1970 detailed four routing corridors, spawning a lawsuit over how Berrien Springs would be bypassed. Construction was to begin in 1975, but the Michigan State <b>Highways</b> <b>Department</b> delayed construction plans in 1972, pushing the start to 1977. The first section was completed in 1979 and ran from the state line north to US12. From there, US31 was routed east along US12 to Bus. US12 and north along Bus. US12 to the former routing of US31/US 33. Final plans for the routing north to I-94 were approved in 1981. Construction of the Niles Bypass was finished in 1987, bringing the freeway north to Walton Road northwest of Niles. Bus. US31 was created along the former routing in Niles and Walton Road was rebuilt as a state trunkline connection between {{the northern end of}} the freeway and the former two-lane routing of US31. The Berrien Springs Bypass was opened in late 1992. Since then, MDOT built a [...] freeway segment north to Napier Avenue that was opened on August 27, 2003 at a cost of $97 million (equivalent to $ in [...] ).|$|E

Between 1939 and 1941, the Delaware State <b>Highway</b> <b>Department</b> widened State Routes 44 and 8 by four to six feet between Dover and Everett’s Corner. Touted as a “long awaited improvement,” the first contract for the widening of State Route 44 between Dover and Pearson’s Corner was completed in 1939 (Delaware State <b>Highway</b> <b>Department</b> 1939) and the improvements to the section of State Route 8 between Pearson’s Corner and Everett’s Corner were completed two years later (Delaware State HighwayDepartment 1941).|$|R
