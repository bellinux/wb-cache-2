30|$|In mid- 1990 s, non-electrical loops (“cold loops”) were {{introduced}} {{as an additional}} tool for hysteroscopic myomectomy [12]. The use of cold loops to enucleate the intramural portion of submucous myomas might avoid the unnecessary extensive <b>electrical</b> <b>cut</b> of surrounding myometrial fibres and the thermal injury of the adiacent myometrium. This “mechanical” approach minimises direct myometrial damage and unnecessary fibrosis {{in the area of}} surgical intervention. Recently, this pioneering technique has proved to be effective in a small series of large submucous myomas (≥ 5  cm) [13]; however, it has never been scrutinized in large and long-term prospective studies. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the feasibility and the short- and long-term efficacy of the combined use of non-electrical “cold” loops and monopolar electrical loops for resectoscopic removal of G 1 and G 2 submucous myomas in a prospective series of symptomatic (bleeding and infertility) premenopausal patients.|$|E

2500|$|The 747's {{cargo door}} used {{a series of}} {{electrically}} operated latch cams into which the door-edge latch pins closed. The cams then rotated into a closed position, holding the door closed. A series of L-shaped arms (called locking sectors) were actuated by the final manual moving of a lever to close the door; these were designed to reinforce the unpowered latch cams and prevent them from rotating into an unlocked position. [...] The locking sectors were made out of aluminum and were too thin a gauge {{to be able to}} keep the latch cams from moving into the unlocked position against the power of the door motors. <b>Electrical</b> switches <b>cut</b> <b>electrical</b> power to the cargo door when the outer handle was closed; but if one of those were faulty, the motors could still draw power and rotate the latch cam to the open position. The same event could happen if frayed wires were able to power the cam-motor, even if the circuit power was cut by the safety switch.|$|R

40|$|The {{magnetostriction}} of Epstein {{strips of}} 0. 30 mm thick grain oriented <b>electrical</b> steel <b>cut</b> using three techniques was measured under longitudinal applied stress.

The parameter {{used to determine}} their effect was the stress shift of the peak to peak magnetostriction. The increase in the magnetostriction, especially under compressive stress, {{is related to the}} appearance of domain stress patterns on the strip surface. Hence, to investigate and correlate the cutting stress with the shift of the curve of magnetostriction against stress, static domain observations were carried out. The results from the magnetostriction under stress measurements show that all utilized cutting techniques set up compressive stress in the strips indicated by a shift of magnetostriction stress sensitivity curves, stress domain patterns on the strips surface, and distortion of B-H loop characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{present a}} method to {{fabricate}} superhydrophobic surfaces on copper substrate using reciprocating type high speed wire <b>cut</b> <b>electrical</b> discharge machining (HS-WEDM) and self-assembly technology.

Results show that a composite structure, composed of craters and projections, is fabricated on the copper surface, which is the key reason of superhydrophobicity. With the change of pulse width, pulse interval, and the number of the power tube, the hydrophobic properties of resulting copper surface was changed.

40|$|Electricity fuels our existence. It powers water purification, waste, food, {{transportation}} and communication systems. Modern social life {{is impossible to}} imagine without it. This article looks at {{what happens when the}} power goes off. It scrutinises the causes and consequences of accidental <b>electrical</b> power <b>cuts.</b> It begins by identifying the reasons for power failure. In doing so, power generation systems are identified as critical infrastructures. They are more fragile than is commonly supposed, and the argument is made that they are getting frailer. Irrespective of cause, blackouts display similar effects. These social patterns are identified. They include measurable economic losses and less easily quantified social costs. Financial damage, food safety, crime, transport issues and problems caused by diesel generators are all discussed. This is more than a record of failures past. It is contended that blackouts are dress rehearsals for the future in which they will appear with greater frequency and greater severity. Increasing numbers of blackouts are anticipated due to growing uncertainties in supply and growing certainties in demand. Supply will become ever more precarious because of peak oil, political instability, infrastructural neglect, global warming and the shift to renewable energy resources. Demand will become stronger because of population growth, rising levels of affluence and the consumer ‘addictions’ which accompany this...|$|R
