We used focal microinjections of pharmacological agents to investigate medullary pathways mediating ear pinna vasoconstriction <b>elicited</b> by electrical stimulation of the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve or by pinching the lip, and pathways mediating mesenteric vasoconstriction <b>elicited</b> by electrical stimulation of the afferent abdominal vagus nerve. Bilateral injection of kynurenate into the rostral ventrolateral medulla reduced arterial pressure and prevented the mesenteric vasoconstriction and the rise in arterial pressure <b>elicited</b> by abdominal vagal stimulation. However, kynurenate did not prevent ear pinna vasoconstriction or the fall in pressure <b>elicited</b> by trigeminal tract stimulation. Similar injections of muscimol also failed to prevent the trigeminally <b>elicited</b> cardiovascular changes. Injections of kynurenate into the raphe–parapyramidal area did not diminish trigeminally <b>elicited</b> ear vasoconstriction or the depressor response.

The trigeminal depressor response {{does not depend on}} either the rostral ventrolateral medulla or the raphe–parapyramidal region.

40|$|Experience-dependent {{plasticity}} in {{the central}} sensory systems depends on activation of both the sensory and neuromodulatory systems.

Therefore the neural circuits <b>eliciting</b> the nonspecific augmentation must be different from that <b>eliciting</b> the BF shifts. We first examined plastic changes in the response properties of collicular neurons of the big brown bat <b>elicited</b> by pseudo-conditioning and found that it <b>elicited</b> prominent nonspecific augmentation—an auditory response increase, a frequency-tuning broadening, and a threshold decreas—and that, in addition, it <b>elicited</b> a small short-lasting BF shift only when the CS frequency was 5 kHz lower than the BF of a recorded neuron. We examined the role of acetylcholine and the auditory and somatosensory cortices in these collicular changes. The development of the nonspecific augmentation was affected little by a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist applied to the inferior colliculus and by a GABAA receptor agonist applied to the auditory or somatosensory cortex. However, these drugs abolished the small short-lasting BF shift as they abolished the large long-lasting cortical and short-lasting collicular BF shifts <b>elicited</b> by the conditioning. These results indicate that, different from the BF shift, the nonspecific augmentation of the inferior colliculus depends on neither the cholinergic neuromodulator nor the auditory and somatosensory cortices...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} study was to determine whether L-PEN attenuates the haemodynamic responses <b>elicited</b> by peroxynitrite in pentobarbital-anaesthetized rats. Peroxynitrite (1 – 20 [*]μmol[*]kg− 1, i. v.) <b>elicited</b> dose-dependent reductions in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and mesenteric and hindquarter vascular resistances.

The initial reductions in MAP and vascular resistances <b>elicited</b> by peroxynitrite were not diminished after administration of L-PEN whereas they were much shorter in duration.
