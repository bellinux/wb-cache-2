40|$|Chitosan and TAT peptide {{have been}} widely {{investigated}} as delivery systems for various biomolecules such as plasmid DNA, oligonucleotides, and siRNAs. Conjugation of chitosan with TAT-peptide was therefore expected to produce a carrier with enhanced ability to facilitate cellular uptake. In this study, chitosan nanoparticles (CNs) were prepared by ionic gelation method prior to conjugation with TAT-peptide via <b>disulphide</b> <b>linkage</b> (CN-TAT). The conjugation was performed at various TAT-peptide-to-chitosan weight ratios ranging from 0. 008 [*]:[*] 1 to 0. 125 [*]:[*] 1. siRNA as a model biomolecule was loaded by adsorption onto the CN-TAT. Nanosize range particles were produced with a size range of less than 700 [*]nm depending on TAT-peptide concentration used. HPLC and Raman spectrometry analysis revealed that TAT-peptide was successfully conjugated to the CN via <b>disulphide</b> <b>linkage.</b> siRNA loading efficiency for CN-TAT was 93 %[*][*]± 0. 01. In vitro cytotoxicity studies showed that CN-TAT has relatively low toxicity. In conclusion, TAT conjugated onto CN via <b>disulphide</b> <b>linkage</b> was successfully synthesized, and its low cytoxicity demonstrates a potential for its use as a vector for biomolecules...|$|E
40|$|An alkyl hydroperoxidase (AhpC) {{has been}} found {{frequently}} to be overexpressed in isoniazid-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. These strains have an inactivated katG gene encoding a catalase peroxidase, which might render mycobacteria susceptible to the toxic peroxide radicals, thus leading to the concomitant overexpression of the AhpC. Although the overexpressed AhpC in isoniazid-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis may not directly participate in isoniazid action, AhpC might still assist M. tuberculosis in combating oxidative damage {{in the absence of}} the catalase. Here we have attempted to characterize the AhpC protein biochemically and report its functional and oligomerization properties. The alkyl hydroperoxidase of M. tuberculosis is unique in many ways compared with its well-characterized homologues from enteric bacteria. We show that AhpC is a decameric protein, composed of five identical dimers held together by ionic interactions. Dimerization of individual subunits takes place through an intersubunit <b>disulphide</b> <b>linkage.</b> The ionic interactions play a significant role in enzymic activity of the AhpC protein. The UV absorption spectrum and three-dimensional model of AhpC suggest that interesting conformational changes may take place during oxidation and reduction of the intersubunit <b>disulphide</b> <b>linkage.</b> In the absence of the partner AhpF subunit in M. tuberculosis, the mycobacterial AhpC might use small-molecule reagents, such as mycothiol, for completing its enzymic cycle...|$|E
40|$|The thiol reagent {{dithiothreitol}} inhibits {{the activity}} of a core GDP-fucose-N-acetylglucosaminide alpha- 6 -fucosyltransferase in plasma and blood-cell homogenates, while promoting {{the activity of}} alpha- 2 - and alpha- 3 -fucosyltransferases. The latter enzymes catalyse transfer of fucose on to terminal galactose and subterminal N-acetylglucosamine residues respectively. A thiol-blocking reagent N-ethylmaleimide {{does not affect the}} activity of the alpha- 6 -fucosyltransferase, but inhibits the other two enzymes.

40|$|Most of {{the work}} on rice storage {{proteins}} focused on the major fraction – glutelin. In contrast to previous reports of the occurrence of single legumin-like polypeptide pair in glutelin, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed many glutelin bands, with some having and some lacking disulphide-linkages. Five legumin-like polypeptide pairs exhibited wide heterogeneity over a range of molecular weight (Mr) 25 to 60 kDa, each having a large subunit (Mr ranged from 18 to 40. 5 kDa) disulphide-bonded to a small subunit (Mr ranged from 16. 5 to 18. 0 kDa). A band of 49 kDa was homodimeric with two subunits of 29 kDa each; a polypeptide of 51 kDa which altered position to ones corresponding to 53 kDa and 57 kDa on 2 -D gels contained intrapolypeptide linkages. Polypeptides of 65 kDa and 60 kDa occurred as aggregates of 110 kDa. The number of polypeptides in other seed protein fractions albumins, globulins and prolamins, varied from four to ten. One of the albumin bands had intrapolypeptide <b>disulphide</b> <b>linkages</b> (20 kDa) and the globulins contained two such bands (13. 5 and 20 kDa). Thus, the present study provides {{a description of the}} polypeptide composition of different rice protein fractions that is finely resolved with respect to the occurrence of <b>disulphide</b> <b>linkages...</b>|$|R

The protein in the crystals from the subspecies kurstaki HD- 1 and entomocidus was found to contain 16 - 18 cysteine residues per molecule, present primarily in the disulphide form as cystine. Evidence that all the cysteine residues form symmetrical interchain <b>disulphide</b> <b>linkages</b> in the protein crystal was obtained from the following results: (i) the disulphide diagonal procedure [Brown & Hartley (1966) Biochem. J. 101, 214 - 228] gave only unpaired cysteic acid peptides in diagonal maps; (ii) the disulphide bridges were shown to be labile in dilute alkali and the crystal protein could be released quantitatively with 1 mM- 2 -mercaptoethanol; (iii) the thiol groups of the released crystal protein were shown by competitive labelling [Kaplan, Stevenson & Hartley (1971) Biochem. J. 124, 289 - 299] to have the same chemical properties as exposed groups on the surface of the protein; (iv) the thiol groups in the released crystal protein reacted quantitatively with iodoacetate or iodoacetamide. The finding that all the <b>disulphide</b> <b>linkages</b> in the protein crystal are interchain and symmetrical accounts for its alkali-lability and for the high degree of conservation in the primary structure of the cystine-containing regions of the protein from various subspecies...|$|R

The two putative receptor/ligand recognition domains are found to be well separated, at opposite ends of a flexible linker.

40|$|Abrin {{belongs to}} the type II family of ribosome-inactivating {{proteins}} comprising a galactose-binding B chain coupled with a toxic A chain through a single <b>disulphide</b> <b>linkage.</b> Apart from its RNA-N-glycosidase activity, another role that has been recently ascribed to abrin was the induction of apoptosis. Studies were undertaken to determine the kinetics of these two activities. In the present study, we report that the signal for apoptosis is triggered at a time point later than the inhibition of protein synthesis. This apoptotic pathway induced by abrin is caspase 3 -dependent but caspase 8 -independent and involves mitochondrial membrane potential damage and reactive oxygen species production. Overexpression of B-cell lymphocytic-leukaemia proto-oncogene 2 was found to block this apoptotic pathway...|$|E

It has been postulated that these residues are involved in <b>disulphide</b> <b>linkages</b> to unknown thiols of low Mr. These two masked cysteine residues have been changed to an alanine, individually.

GSH {{is more effective}} in urea than in guanidine and its action is greatly enhanced by EDTA. An optimum pH of about 9 · 0 was found for the inhibitory effect of GSH. Titration of the thiol groups formed after inactivation of ribonuclease by GSH strongly suggests that the reduction of only one <b>disulphide</b> <b>linkage</b> is involved.

40|$|Disulphide bonds play an {{important}} role in protein structure and function. Bovine k-casein (k-csn), {{an important}} glycoprotein in milk, contains two cysteines that can form disulphide bonds. On 2 -D gels run under nonreducing conditions the k-csn in milk presented a complex pattern of monomers and disulphide-linked oligomers. Trains of spots corresponding to monomers to hexamers were observed as a result of the participation of different glycoforms and phosphoforms in oligomer formation. The dimers and trimers ran as doublets on the gel and analysis of the disulphide-linked peptides released from them after in-gel tryptic digestion showed they were the result of different <b>disulphide</b> <b>linkages.</b> The linkages were confirmed by MSMS. When milks with electrophoretically distinct genetic variants of k-csn were mixed and run on 2 -D gels, they retained their distinct patterns indicating that disulphide exchange reactions or disulphide ‘scrambling’ was not occurring during 2 -D analysis.

The intracellular pool of alpha and gamma chains remained unchanged under beta-chain RNAi by lipofection of double-stranded RNA encoding a beta-chain partial sequence. This {{was also the}} case for the intracellular pool of alpha and beta chains under gamma-chain-specific RNAi. Nonetheless, the intracellular pool of beta and gamma chains increased markedly under alpha-chain-specific RNAi. Non-reducing SDS/PAGE revealed that some of the increased beta and gamma chains migrated as disulphide-linked betagamma dimers but that the rest migrated as monomers. Since the monomeric beta and gamma bands detected under alpha-chain RNAi were denser than the beta band under gamma-chain RNAi and the gamma band under beta-chain RNAi, respectively, beta and gamma also appeared to accumulate by forming betagamma dimers without the <b>disulphide</b> <b>linkage.</b> We suggest that interconversion of these betagamma dimers is crucial for the replaceable and selective assembly of the alpha chain for alphabetagamma trimer formation...|$|E

In this report, we probe {{the structure of}} the copper refolded form of MoPrP to determine how copper binding alters the secondary and tertiary features of the protein. Circular dichroism showed that recombinant MoPrP prepared in the presence of copper (as Cu(++)) showed an increased signal in the 210 - 220 nm range of the spectrum. Changes in protein conformation were localised to the N-terminal region of MoPrP using a panel of antibodies to assess epitope accessibility. The copper refolded recombinant prion protein had reduced proteinase K (PK) sensitivity when compared to the non-copper liganded form. Reduced PK sensitivity was not due to aggregation however as high resolution electron microscopy showed a homogenous preparation with little aggregate when compared to the non-copper form. Finally, disruption of the single <b>disulphide</b> <b>linkage</b> in MoPrP significantly diminished the antioxidant activity of the copper refolded form suggesting that activity was not solely dependent on bound copper but also on a conformation enabled by the formation of the disulphide bond...|$|E
40|$|Eight human IgA 1 myeloma {{proteins}} were analysed by SDS-PAGE. These experiments {{showed that}} purified IgA 1 proteins comprise both fully S-S bonded and partly S-S bonded molecules. Pepsin digestion of the IgA 1 proteins yielded three four-chain and two two-chain fragments. The four-chain fragments {{are likely to}} be derived from intact IgA through cleavage of its alpha chains at different sites: between the CH 2 and CH 3 domains or in the hinge region. The occurrence of F(abc) (ab') fragments, with alpha chains of different lengths, showed that the alpha chains of IgA can be cleaved independently at the hinge region site. The two-chain pepsin fragments must originate from IgA molecules, which lack inter-assay-chain <b>disulphide</b> <b>linkages.</b> The fragments F(abc) 2 and Fabc tended to form dimers, probably through non-covalent interactions of their CH 2 domains.

Fabc fragments were produced from an unrelated myeloma IgA.

Protein Vla and the Fabc fragments could both be cleaved by IgA 1 protease from Streptococcus sanguis, which indicates the presence of the alpha 1 hinge region. An inventory of its antigenic determinants and their similarity to those of previously characterized F(abc) 2 fragments, indicates that protein Vla, like the Fabc fragments, contains the CH 1 and CH 2 domains, but lacks most of the CH 3 domain. The fact that cleavage by IgA 1 protease from S. sanguis yields a Fab fragment but fails to yield a CH 2 domain demonstrates that cleavage by the enzyme is not only restricted to the Pro 227 -Thr 228 bond in the IgA 1 hinge region...|$|E
40|$|Mutations in alpha 1 -antitrypsin (AAT) {{can cause}} the protein to polymerise and be {{retained}} in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of hepatocytes. The ensuing systemic AAT deficiency leads to pulmonary emphysema, while intracellular polymers are toxic and cause chronic liver disease. The severity of this process varies considerably between individuals, suggesting the involvement of mechanistic co-factors and potential for therapeutically beneficial interventions. We show in Hepa 1. 6 cells that the mildly polymerogenic I (Arg 39 Cys) AAT mutant forms aberrant inter- and intra-molecular disulphide bonds involving the acquired Cys 39 and the only cysteine residue in the wild-type (M) sequence (Cys 232). Substitution of Cys 39 to serine partially restores secretion, showing that disulphide bonding contributes to the intracellular retention of I AAT. Covalent homodimers mediated by inter-Cys 232 bonding alone are also observed in cells expressing the common Z and other polymerising AAT variants where conformational behaviour is abnormal, but not in those expressing M AAT. Prevention of such <b>disulphide</b> <b>linkage</b> through {{the introduction of the}} Cys 232 Ser mutation or by treatment of cells with reducing agents increases Z AAT secretion. Our results reveal that disulphide interactions enhance intracellular accumulation of AAT mutants and implicate the oxidative ER state as a pathogenic co-factor.

High pressure {{has the potential}} to act as a preservation agent for foods and has been applied to protein systems at low levels of solids (&lt; 20 %, w/w) for research on gelation or emulsification as well as proteolysis and enzymatic inactivation. However, the effect of high pressure on the molecular properties of globular proteins at high levels of solids (up to 80 %, w/w) is not characterised to date. Therefore, the main objective of this Thesis was to illustrate the structural and functional properties of condensed globular protein systems (bovine serum albumin, soy glycinin, ovalbumin and whey protein) subjected to high pressure treatment in relation to: • Stability of secondary conformation against high pressure treatment • Changes in the thermomechanical glass transition of pressurized protein systems • Microbial kill and enzyme inactivation in high solid protein systems following application of high pressure Thermomechanical and X-ray diffraction examination of all globular proteins argues for glassy behaviour at subzero temperatures in high solid preparations (e. g. 80 %, w/w) recorded experimentally and modelled theoretically. That was discussed {{based on the assumption that}} free volume decreases linearly with temperature, and the glass transition temperature (Tg) was defined as the point where the thermal expansion coefficient undergoes a discontinuity, with thermal motions becoming extremely slow. MicroDSC and deconvoluted FTIR spectra argue that disulphide bonds are involved in the pressure stability of globular proteins, with BSA, which consists of a sequence of seventeen disulphide bridges, maintaining native morphology. Soy glycinin with twelve disulphide linkages shows considerable molecular unfolding at low to intermediate levels of solids (up to 60 %, w/w), whereas whey protein with two disulphide bonds in the beta-lactoglobulin molecule is the most affected globular protein under pressure. Additional effects were noted based on the concept of surface hydrophobicity of the globular molecule. Ovalbumin with one <b>disulphide</b> <b>linkage</b> has a hydrophobicity value (So) of about 100, which is within the range of BSA (So ~ 2200) and whey protein (So ~ 35). Its extent of denaturation falls between that of BSA and whey protein indicating that both phenomena, i. e. <b>disulphide</b> <b>linkage</b> and surface hydrophobicity combine to produce the observed behaviour in phase morphology of globular proteins in relation to high pressure treatment. Once the structural and mechanical properties of globular proteins under high pressure were studied, our efforts turned into the survival rate of foodborne pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and E. coli) and the proteolytic activity of degradative enzymes from Pseudomonas fluorescens strains 73 and 113, with a view to approximating product applications. Use of high pressure (600 MPa for 15 min at room temperature, which are conditions of industrial relevance) resulted in considerable reduction of foodborne pathogens. In accordance with the structural studies, soy glycinin with the highest water holding capacity exhibits increased protease and microbiological activity, as compared to BSA and ovalbumin systems...|$|E

In this study, we constructed a new recombinant expression plasmid containing the coding sequence of 56 -residue B 1 domain of streptococcal protein G (GB 1). For easy purification and cleavage of the recombinant proteins, except GB 1, an engineered hexahistidine and tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease recognition sites were included in the fusion sequence. Next, we cloned the coding sequence of human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) into this new plasmid and produced the recombinant hEGF in E. coli. The bioactive hEGF is a 53 -amino acid peptide and is stabilized by three intramolecular disulphide bonds. Compared with glutathione S-transferase, thioredoxin and small ubiquitin-related modifier, GB 1 greatly improved the expression and solubility of hEGF. Moreover, the recombinant hEGF bound to the nickel nitrilotriacetic acid resin column, was easily cleaved by TEV protease and the free hEGF was released. The results showed that this new plasmid was appropriate for recombinant production of small bioactive peptides, such as hEGF, which contains a high proportion of hydrophobic residues and intramolecular <b>disulphide</b> <b>linkages...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for the purification of human enterokinase from accumulated duodenal fluid by affinity chromatography using p-aminobenzamidine as the ligand. Resolution was greatest when glycylglycine was substituted as the spacer arm. Purification {{was not a}} one-step procedure, and some contamination, principally by the alpha-glucosidases, remained. Their removal was completed by immunoadsorption using antisera raised to enterokinase-free material containing these enzymes, prepared as a by-product of the purification procedure. The final preparation had an activity of 4260 nmol of trypsin/min per mg and was free of other enzymic activity tested. Amino acid and sugar analyses of the highly purified enzyme indicated an acidic glycoprotein containing 57 % sugar (neutral sugars 47 %, amino sugars 10 %). The apparent mol. wts. and Stokes radii of human and pig enterokinase were 296 000 and 316 000, and 5. 65 and 5. 78 nm respectively. Two isoenzymes were identified for human enterokinase and three for the pig enzyme. Human enterokinase demonstrated a resistance to reduction of <b>disulphide</b> <b>linkages</b> and to sodium dodecyl sulphate binding, which {{may be related to}} the need for it to retain its integrity in the digestive environment of the upper small intestine. Antisera to highly purified pig and human enterokinases specifically inhibited enterokinase activity. Immuno-inhibition of intestinal aminopeptidase, maltase and glucoamylase by homologous antisera was not observed...|$|R
