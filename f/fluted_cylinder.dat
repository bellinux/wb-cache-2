5000|$|... #Caption: Army 1860 with <b>fluted</b> <b>Cylinder</b> and 7.5-inch barrel serial No. 1158 ...|$|E
5000|$|The Cloverleaf Model had a four rounds <b>fluted</b> <b>{{cylinder}}.</b> When {{viewed from}} front or rear the cylinder seemed {{to resemble a}} four-leaf clover, hence the moniker.|$|E
50|$|The Model 3, 4 and 5 had a <b>fluted</b> <b>cylinder</b> (with {{indentations}} {{between the}} loading chambers), preventing {{the application of}} a continuously engraved scene. Some cylinders were decoratively hand-engraved.|$|E
50|$|Genuine Austrian Gasser {{products}} are marked 'L. GASSER PATENT WIEN' or 'L. GASSER OTTAKRING PATENT', and often carry the Gasser trademark {{of a heart}} pierced by an arrow. Gasser also produced revolvers for the commercial market. The Gasser-Kropatschek, for example, appeared with <b>fluted</b> <b>cylinders</b> instead of the smooth-surfaced military pattern. He also produced the 9mm 'Post & Police' solid frame non-ejecting double-action revolver, with a hexagonal barrel. A commercial version of this gun was also made, generally offering better finish. There was also a commercial version of the open-frame M1874 in 9mm, and a 9mm hinged frame self-extracting model with the Galand double-action lock.|$|R
50|$|There {{were few}} {{variations}} of the Model 1861 Navy Colt. Approximately 100 of the first guns made had <b>fluted</b> <b>cylinders</b> with no cylinder scene. Another 100, made between the serial ranges of 11,000 and 14,000 were cut for a shoulder stock - the lower portion of the recoil shield was milled away and a fourth screw for the stock {{was added to the}} frame. With the exception of the first fifty or so of this model, all guns had a capping groove. A brass trigger guard and back strap, silver-plated, were standard. The cylinders of the Navy 1851 and 1861 Navy Colt revolvers are engraved with a scene of the victory of the Second Texas Navy at the Battle of Campeche on May 16, 1843. The engraving was provided by Waterman Ormsby.|$|R
5000|$|The LCRx {{includes}} the friction-reducing cam for the smooth trigger pull, but the LCRx has an exposed hammer {{that can be}} cocked allowing the revolver to be fired in single or double action. All the other features of the LCR [...]38 Special are also present in the LCRx including the polymer grip, trigger housing, and <b>fluted</b> stainless steel <b>cylinder.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{first version}} used a frame to {{stabilize}} the rack. This was soon dispensed with as the design was simplified. Later engines dispensed with the <b>fluted</b> <b>cylinder</b> as well. The atmospheric engine used a gas flame ignition system and was made in output sizes from [...]|$|E
5000|$|Model 1 [...]32 caliber 7-shot or [...]38 Caliber 5-shot, spur trigger single-action revolver, 3-inch {{octagonal}} barrel, <b>fluted</b> <b>cylinder,</b> flat frame, saw-handle square butt, plain walnut {{or black}} checkered rubber grips, marked HARRINGTON & RICHARDSON, WORCESTER, MASS. PAT. MAY 23, 1876. Approximately 3,000 were manufactured in 1877 and 1878.|$|E
5000|$|Production {{began in}} 1855 with the Model 1 {{followed}} by the Model 1A and then the Model 2 beginning with serial number [...] "1" [...] and ending in 1860 at about [...] "25,000". These models had a roller-die engraved scene {{referred to as the}} [...] "Cabin and Indian" [...] scene. Production continued with the Model 3 which has a <b>fluted</b> <b>cylinder</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1860, the [...]36 caliber Police Pocket {{model was}} created, after lessons were learned from {{experimentation}} {{aimed at reducing}} {{the size of the}} [...]44 Colt Holster Pistols (i.e. large cavalry weapons), Colt took advantage of stronger mass-produced steel by rebating the frame of the Navy revolver to hold a larger-diameter 44/100-inch chambered cylinder, basically fitting the power of a large cavalry saddle holster-gun and fitting it into the [...]36 caliber Navy Model, a gun that could be carried in a belt holster. Previously, it wasn't thought that the smaller frame could handle the power of the [...]44 round, but the introduction of stronger metals made it possible. Learning the lessons from this, the Colt factory applied the same technology to the [...]31 caliber Model 1849 Pocket revolvers, using high-strength (for the time) steel for the frame, which allowed them to remove enough material to fit a larger-diameter [...]36 caliber cylinder which still had five shots (the alternative was to simply retain the original cylinder diameter, and create a 4-shot [...]36 caliber version. The stronger steels made this sacrifice unnecessary. Other changes including lightweight <b>fluted</b> <b>cylinders,</b> and a round barrel, to offset the added weight, and a [...] "creeping" [...] loading lever as used in the 1861 Army Model; the result was the [...] "Police Pocket Model of 1862". The Pocket Navy was a version similarly up-sized to [...]36 caliber, but which retained the octagonal barrel and traditional loading lever of the earlier pocket mode. Between 1862 and 1873, Colt records document production of 19,000 of the Pocket Navies and over 20,000 Pocket Police revolvers. Relative to the [...]31 Pocket Revolvers, the period of manufacture was short and overall numbers were further limited by a fire at the Colt Factory in 1862 and War production concerns.|$|R
5000|$|The Pocket Model revolvers {{all have}} a {{traditional}} [...] "Colt-style" [...] frame, generally with brass grip straps and trigger guard, and a case-hardened steel frame. In appearance, the frames are almost identical to the larger 1851 Navy and [...]44 caliber 1860 Army Models, {{with the exception of}} being smaller, and so having a proportionately larger trigger guard. Since they appear so similar to the larger weapons, without an object nearby to give them scale, the Pocket Revolvers tend to give an impression of being larger than they actually are; it is difficult to fit all four fingers onto the slender grip, even for a person with average-sized hands. Except for by noting the relative size of the trigger guard to the frame, it is easy for a casual observer to mistake a [...]31 caliber Model 1849 for an 1851 Navy (un-rebated frame, slab-sided webbing around a regular pivoting loading lever, octagonal barrel, unfluted cylinder); indeed, the Model 1851 Navy was basically no more than a scaled -up 1849 Pocket Model. Likewise, the larger [...]36 caliber Pocket Police Models are virtually identical to the 1860 Army Model, with rebated frame and stepped cylinder (to accommodate a size up from [...]31 to [...]36, instead of [...]36 to [...]44 as with the Army Model), a graceful, flowing webbing surrounding a new style [...] "creeping" [...] loading lever, and a round barrel. The most obvious difference is that the Pocket Police had a <b>fluted</b> 5-shot <b>cylinder,</b> while most Army Models were unfluted, and held six shots. The reason for this close similarity is that all four guns were closely related, and followed similar paths of development; the original [...]31 caliber Model 1849 was scaled up to create the [...]36 caliber 1851 Navy Model. Later, the Navy Model was increased in bore size by rebating the frame and enlarging the cylinder, and became the 1860 Army Model. With the success of this project, the [...]31 caliber of the 1849 Model was similarly increased to [...]36, using the same method, creating the Pocket Police and Pocket Navy models.|$|R
50|$|By April 1861, 2,230 of Colt's {{earliest}} production went to dealers {{south of}} the Mason-Dixon line. The United States Navy ordered 900 <b>fluted</b> <b>cylinder</b> revolvers in May 1861 later issued to ships enforcing the Atlantic and Gulf blockade. United States Army orders also began in May, and 127,157 had been delivered before a 5 October 1864 fire put Colt's factory out of operation {{for the duration of}} hostilities.|$|E
50|$|A {{variation}} on the dot matrix printer was the cross hammer dot printer, patented by Seikosha in 1982. The smooth cylindrical roller of a conventional printer {{was replaced by a}} spinning, <b>fluted</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The print head was a simple hammer, with a vertical projecting edge, operated by an electromagnet. Where the vertical edge of the hammer intersected the horizontal flute of the cylinder, compressing the paper and ribbon between them, a single dot was marked on the paper. Characters were built up of multiple dots.|$|E
5000|$|Between 25,000 and 30,000 were {{manufactured}} {{during the}} years 1875-1889 in three different chamberings: [...]44 Remington Centerfire; [...]44-40; and [...]45 caliber. These were not optional; rather, the caliber of production models was determined by their date of manufacture[...]45 caliber cylinders were slightly longer to prevent accidental insertion into a [...]44 frame. Standard features included a <b>fluted</b> <b>cylinder,</b> walnut grip panels, blued or nickel-plated finish with case-hardened hammer and loading gate, and a lanyard ring. Standard barrel length was 7 1/2 inches, although very few revolvers were produced with 5 3/4-inch barrels.|$|E
5000|$|The Chamelot-Delvigne 11mm Modele 1873 {{was adopted}} by the French army as a service {{revolver}} for non-commissioned officers. The Modele 1874 Revolver d'Officier was the version issued to officers. The differences between the two models included the following: the 1873 was finished in the white, whereas the 1874 had a <b>fluted</b> <b>cylinder</b> and a blued finish. The 1873 and 1874 were the first center-fire cartridge revolvers adopted by the French army. They had solid-frame, side-ejection, double-action mechanisms. The pistols were manufactured by the St. Etienne armoury, which still continues to manufacture fine sporting arms.|$|E
5000|$|The Model 1, 3rd Issue {{represented}} a substantial redesign for the Model 1, with a <b>fluted</b> <b>cylinder,</b> a round barrel and a rounded [...] "bird's head" [...] style grip. Finishes included full nickel plating, full blued steel, and a [...] "half plate" [...] nickel/blue combo, {{and there were}} two barrel lengths offered by the factory. Variants include the [...] "square" [...] and [...] "triangular" [...] top strap design that changed around serial number 9,500. The 3rd Issue guns were produced from 1868 through 1882 with serial numbers from 1 through approximately 131,000.|$|E
5000|$|Introduced in 2005, the Ruger Alaskan is Ruger's first short-barrelled, big-bore revolver, {{conceived}} by Ruger president Steve Sanetti and intended for defense against large, dangerous animals. The -inch barrel on the Alaskan {{ends at the}} end of the frame, and the scope bases are omitted. [...] The interchangeable front sight is replaced with a pinned-in ramp sight, but the adjustable rear sight is retained. The Alaskan is available in [...]44 Magnum, [...]454 Casull/.45 Colt, and [...]480 Ruger, with the [...]480 model originally a 6-shot, replaced in 2008 with a 5-shot model to aid in spent cartridge extraction. [...] All Alaskans feature a brushed stainless finish and a Hogue Tamer rubber finger groove grip, rather than the standard GP100 style. [...] The [...]454 and [...]480 versions have an unfluted cylinder while the [...]44 Magnum features a <b>fluted</b> <b>cylinder.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Ruger LCR is {{a compact}} {{revolver}} built by Ruger and announced in January 2009. The LCR acronym stands for 'Lightweight Compact Revolver'. It incorporates several novel {{features such as}} a polymer grip and trigger housing, monolithic receiver, and constant force trigger. At 13.5 oz, the LCR is nearly 50% lighter than the stainless steel SP101 and with only the barrel and <b>fluted</b> <b>cylinder</b> made of stainless steel. The frame is aluminum alloy and synthetic glass-filled polymer finished in matte black with Synergistic Hard Coat. The LCR operates in double-action only (DAO) as the hammer is concealed within the frame handle's fire control housing of the gun and cannot be cocked prior to firing. In {{order to create a}} crisp and light trigger pull that is non-stacking, it features a friction reducing cam, a feature seldom found on double-action revolvers (which by nature of their mechanism normally have a very heavy trigger pull).|$|E
