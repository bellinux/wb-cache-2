40|$|Introduction & Objective: <b>Ficin</b> is {{a member}} of plant cystein proteases that is {{abundant}} in fig. This enzyme has many pharmacological and industrial uses. In the present study, the enzyme was purified by a simple procedure and its proteolytic activity was assayed on several plant and animal proteins. Materials & Methods: <b>Ficin</b> was extracted from unripe fig, precipitated by ammonium sulfate and purified using ion-exchange chromatography on a Carboxymethyl Sepharose column. Proteolytic activities of the purified enzyme were determined in 4 buffering conditions on casein, alpha lactalbumin, beta lactoglobulin and gelatin proteins. Results: Purified enzymes include two bands with molecular mass of 24 and 26 KDa. Re-sults of proteolytic activity showed that <b>ficin</b> can digest casein. It has moderate hydrolytic activity on beta lactoglobulin and gelatin but <b>ficin</b> can not hydrolyze alpha lactalbumin. Conclusion: It seems <b>ficin</b> has selective effects on some proteins so it can be a good candi-date for digestion of casein and making related drugs.

40|$|The enzymes pepsin and trypsin do {{not attack}} living cells, nor most native proteins. <b>Ficin,</b> however, kills and digests living Ascaris in vitro (Robbins, 1930, 1935) and papain {{probably}} hydrolyzes both native and denatured proteins (Lineweaver and Hoover, 1941). The writer suggested (Northrop, 1926) {{that the failure}} of pepsin and trypsin to digest living ceils {{was due to the}} fact that the enzymes could not pass the cell membrane.

40|$|Papain and <b>ficin</b> are general {{non-specific}} plant thiol proteases {{applied in}} food processing. Inactivation kinetics of papain and <b>ficin</b> were studied for thermal (50 - 80 degrees C, ambient pressure) and high pressure/temperature (500 - 900 MPa at 50 - 80 degrees C) process conditions. The effect of temperature at each {{pressure and the}} effect of pressure at each temperature were expressed by the values of activation energy. E-a, and activation volume, V-a The two enzymes showed the same inactivation under thermal process. At high pressures, at each process temperature, increase of pressure increases the inactivation rate. Up to 60 degrees C for <b>ficin</b> and 70 degrees C for papain, inactivation rates at high pressures are higher than the corresponding thermal rates at ambient pressure. At higher temperatures up to certain pressures an antagonistic effect was observed. At 80 degrees C thermal inactivation rates at all high pressures are lower than the ones at ambient pressure. E-a increased for papain (from 50 to 88 kJ/mol) and decreased for <b>ficin</b> (from 139 to 43 kJ/mol) as process pressure increased, a different effect of pressure on temperature sensitivity. V-a depended on process temperature showing increasing effect of pressure at higher temperatures for papain and decreasing for <b>ficin.</b> The enzymes inactivation rate constant was modeled as a function of both temperature and pressure conditions by a multi-parameter equation. Overall, papain and <b>ficin</b> showed a high thermal and pressure stability requiring intense process conditions for adequate inactivation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|A novel <b>ficin</b> form, named <b>ficin</b> E, was {{purified}} from {{fig tree}} latex {{by a combination}} of cation-exchange chromatography on SP-Sepharose Fast Flow, Thiopropyl Sepharose 4 B and fplc-gel filtration chromatography. The new <b>ficin</b> appeared not to be sensitive to thiol derivatization by a polyethylene glycol derivative, allowing its purification. The protease is homogeneous according to PAGE, SDS-PAGE, mass spectrometry, N-terminal micro-sequencing analyses and E- 64 active site titration. N-terminal sequencing of the first ten residues has shown high identity with the other known <b>ficin</b> (iso) forms. The molecular weight was found to be (24, 294 ± 10) Da by mass spectrometry, a lower value than the apparent molecular weight observed on SDS-PAGE, around 27 kDa. Far-UV CD data revealed a secondary structure content of 22 % α-helix and 26 % β-sheet. The protein is not glycosylated as shown by carbohydrate analysis. pH and temperature measurements indicated maxima activity at pH 6. 0 and 50 °C, respectively. Preliminary pH stability analyses have shown that the protease conserved its compact structure in slightly acidic, neutral and alkaline media but at acidic pH (< 3), the formation of some relaxed or molten state was evidenced by 8 -anilino- 1 -naphtalenesulfonic acid binding characteristics. Comparison with the known ficins A, B, C, D 1 and D 2 (iso) forms revealed that <b>ficin</b> E showed activity profile that looked like <b>ficin</b> A against two chromogenic substrates while it resembled ficins D 1 and D 2 against three fluorogenic substrates. Enzymatic activity of <b>ficin</b> E was not affected by Mg(2 +), Ca(2 +) and Mn(2 +) at a concentration up to 10 mM. However, the activity was completely suppressed by Zn(2 +) at a concentration of 1 mM. Inhibitory activity measurements clearly identified the enzyme as a cysteine protease, being unaffected by synthetic (Pefabloc SC, benzamidine) and by natural proteinaceous (aprotinin) serine proteases inhibitors, by aspartic proteases inhibitors (pepstatin A) and by metallo-proteases inhibitors (EDTA, EGTA). Surprisingly, it was well affected by the metallo-protease inhibitor o-phenanthroline. The enzymatic activity was however completely blocked by cysteine proteases inhibitors (E- 64, iodoacetamide), by thiol-blocking compounds (HgCl 2) and by cysteine/serine proteases inhibitors (TLCK and TPCK). This is a novel <b>ficin</b> form according to peptide mass fingerprint analysis, specific amidase activity, SDS-PAGE and PAGE electrophoretic mobility, N-terminal sequencing and unproneness to thiol pegylation.

40|$|The latex of Ficus carica {{constitutes}} {{an important source}} of many proteolytic components known under the general term of <b>ficin</b> (EC 3. 4. 22. 3) which belongs to the cysteine proteases of the papain family. So far, no data on the purification and characterization of individual forms of these proteases are available. An effective strategy was used to fractionate and purify to homogeneity five <b>ficin</b> forms, designated A, B, C, D 1 and D 2 according to their sequence of elution from a cation-exchange chromatographic support. Following rapid fractionation on a SP-Sepharose Fast Flow column, the different <b>ficin</b> forms were chemically modified by a specific and reversible monomethoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG) reagent. In comparison with their un-derivatized counterparts, the mPEG-protein derivatives behaved differently on the ion-exchanger, allowing us {{for the first time to}} obtain five highly purified <b>ficin</b> molecular species titrating 1 mol of thiol group per mole of enzyme. The purified ficins were characterized by de novo peptide sequencing and peptide mass fingerprinting analyzes, using mass spectrometry. Circular dichroism measurements indicated that all five ficins were highly structured, both in term of secondary and tertiary structure. Furthermore, analysis of far-UV CD spectra allowed calculation of their secondary structural content. Both these data and the molecular masses determined by MS reinforce the view that the enzymes belong to the family of papain-like proteases. The five <b>ficin</b> forms also displayed different specific amidase activities against small synthetic substrates like dl-BAPNA and Boc-Ala-Ala-Gly-pNA, suggesting some differences in their active site organization. Enzymatic activity of the five <b>ficin</b> forms was completely inhibited by specific cysteine and cysteine/serine proteases inhibitors but was unaffected by specific serine, aspartic and metallo proteases inhibitors.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between cystatin C variants, {{in which the}} evolutionarily conserved Gly- 11 residue was substituted by Ala, Glu or Trp, and the cysteine proteinases, papain, <b>ficin,</b> actinidin and cathepsin B, was characterized. The substitutions reduced the affinity of binding {{in a manner consistent}} with the Gly residue of the wild-type inhibitor, allowing the N-terminal region to adopt a conformation that was optimal for interaction with target proteinases. Replacement of Gly- 11 by Ala resulted in only a 5 - to 100 -fold reduction in binding affinity. Comparison with the affinities of wild-type cystatin C lacking the N-terminal region indicated that even this small structural change affects the conformation of this region sufficiently to largely abolish its interaction with the weakly binding proteinases, actinidin and cathepsin B. However, the substitution allows interactions of appreciable strength between the N-terminal region and the tightly binding enzymes, papain or <b>ficin.</b> Replacement of Gly- 11 with the larger Glu and Trp residues substantially decreased the affinity of binding to all enzymes, from 10 (3) - to 10 (5) -fold. These substitutions further affect the conformation of the N-terminal region, so that interactions of this region with papain and <b>ficin</b> are also essentially eliminated. The decreased affinities of the three cystatin C variants for papain, <b>ficin</b> and actinidin were due exclusively to increased dissociation rate constants. In contrast, the decreased affinity between cathepsin B and the Ala- 11 variant, the only one for which rate constants could be determined with this enzyme, was due almost entirely to a decreased association rate constant. This behaviour is analogous to that observed for forms of cystatin C lacking the N-terminal region and supports the conclusion that the mode of interaction of this region with target proteinases varies with the enzyme as a result of structural differences in the active-site region of the latter...|$|E

Currently industrialized softeners mainly consisting of papain can make the softening of the meat. These softeners have industrial advantages of being readily available and relatively inexpensive, and easy to use. The enzymatic softening of the meat is a result of partial degradation of the meat component. The papain from papaya, bromelain from pineapple and <b>ficin</b> from fig have effective softener action.
