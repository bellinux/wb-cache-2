When a <b>firm’s</b> private information is one-dimensional, greater transparency of the public signal unambiguously enhances investment efficiency. However, we show that when a <b>firm’s</b> private information is two-dimensional, the effect of enhanced transparency along merely one dimension of the <b>firm’s</b> profitability is ambiguous. The social value of more transparent public information that sheds light on just one dimension of a <b>firm’s</b> profitability depends on the transparency of public information about the other dimension of the <b>firm’s</b> profitability.
