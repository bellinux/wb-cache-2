The aim {{of the current study}} was to examine the effect of using <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> as an exclusive method of feeding preterm infants during hospitalization on breastfeeding outcomes after discharge. Methods A quasi-experimental design, with the control group studied first, was used to examine the effect of <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> for preterm infants on breastfeeding outcomes after discharge. Sixty preterm infants (mean gestational age was 35. 13 weeks and mean birth weight was 2150 grams) were recruited during Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) stay. Control group infants (n = 30) received only bottle feedings during hospitalization and the experimental group (n = 30) received only cup feedings during hospitalization. Both groups were followed up after discharge for six weeks to evaluate infant's breastfeeding behavior and mother's breastfeeding practices. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and repeated measures ANOVA for testing the differences between the <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> and bottle feeding groups over six weeks after discharge. Results Cup fed infants demonstrated significantly more mature breastfeeding behaviors when compared to bottle fed infants (p Conclusion Cup fed infants were more exclusively breast fed one week after discharge, supporting the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative recommendations for using <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> and avoiding bottle feeding when providing supplementation for preterm infants.

However, it is not yet clear if tits respond to video playback or how their behavioural responses should be measured. Behaviours may also differ depending on what they observe demonstrators encountering. Here we present blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) videos of demonstrators discovering palatable or aversive prey (injected with bitter-tasting Bitrex) from coloured <b>feeding</b> <b>cups.</b> First we quantify variation in demonstrators' responses to the prey items: aversive prey provoked high rates of beak wiping and head shaking. We then show that focal blue tits respond differently to the presence of a demonstrator on a video screen, depending on whether demonstrators discover palatable or aversive prey. Focal birds faced the video screen more during aversive prey presentations, and made more head turns. Regardless of prey type, focal birds also hopped more frequently during the presence of a demonstrator (compared to a control video of a different coloured <b>feeding</b> <b>cup</b> in an empty cage). Finally, we tested if demonstrators' behaviour affected focal birds' food preferences by giving individuals a choice to forage from the same cup as a demonstrator, or from the cup in the control video. We found that only half of the individuals made their choice in accordance to social information in the videos, i. e., their foraging choices were not different from random. Individuals that chose in accordance with a demonstrator, however, made their choice faster than individuals that chose an alternative cup. Together, our results suggest that video playback can provide social cues to blue tits, but individuals vary greatly in how they use this information in their foraging decisions...|$|R

One potential reason this alternative is underutilized is lack of health care providers’ (HCP) knowledge and negative beliefs regarding <b>cup</b> <b>feeding.</b> Jordan and the United States have different health systems, languages, cultures, and economies. A cross cultural comparison of HCP’s knowledge and beliefs in these two contrasting countries may yield some interesting and valuable findings that may further inform clinicians and educators. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the impact of country, occupation, neonatal health care experience, and level of education on knowledge, beliefs, preference, and past behavior regarding feeding types. Theoretical Framework: The Knowledge-Attitude-Behavior Model was used as a guidance. Methods: A non-experimental cross-cultural correlational design was used to evaluate study goals. A convenient sample of 160 neonatal nurses and physicians from US and Jordan was recruited to complete a web-based survey. Recruitment strategies included Email, website links, and snowballing. Analysis included descriptive, t-test, crosstabs, and Multiple regression analysis. Results: 178 eligible participants submitted the questionnaire online. Among the respondents, 85 were from Jordan and 70 were from US. The average number of years in neonatal health care experience was 13. 7 (SD = 12. 3), and almost half of the participants (47. 7 %) had at least 10 years of neonatal health care experience. Almost half of the participants had a BSN or less (55. 1 %). US sample had more knowledge and positive beliefs about all feeding types, and reported higher overall <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> use than Jordanian sample. Physicians had more knowledge and positive believes regarding breast- and cup-feeding, and reported higher feeding preference and practice variables scores than nurses. Participants with at least 10 years of neonatal experience had more knowledge and positive beliefs regarding all feeding types and reported higher overall <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> use scores than participants with less than 10 years of neonatal experience. Participants with an advanced degree had more knowledge and positive beliefs regarding all feeding types, and they reported higher <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> preference and practice scores than participants with a BSN degree or lower.

40|$|Copyright © 2008 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. BACKGROUND: Preterm infants start milk feeds {{by gavage}} tube. As they mature, sucking feeds are {{gradually}} introduced. Women {{who choose to}} breast feed their preterm infant are not always available and an alternative approach to feeding is needed. Most commonly, milk (expressed breast milk or formula) is given by bottle. There is some controversy about whether using bottles during the establishment of breast feeds is detrimental to breastfeeding success. OBJECTIVES: To {{determine the effect of}} avoidance of bottle feeds during the establishment of breastfeeding on the likelihood of successful breastfeeding and to determine if alternatives to bottle feeds are safe. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, CINAHL and EMBASE in any language. The search was updated in July 2008. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi randomised controlled trials comparing avoidance of bottles with use of bottles in women who have chosen to breast feed their preterm infant. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. When appropriate, we contacted study authors for additional information. Standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used. MAIN RESULTS: Five trials of 543 infants were included. Four trials used a <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> strategy and one trial used a tube feeding strategy when supplements to breast feeds were needed. The single study of tube feeding had a high risk of bias. In the analysis of all five trials, significant heterogeneity was evident in two of the primary outcomes. This was reduced when the tube feeding trial was removed from analyses. <b>Cup</b> <b>feeding</b> significantly decreased 'no breastfeeding or only partial breast feeding' on discharge home (summary RR 0. 75, 95 % CI 0. 61 to 0. 91). However, <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> significantly increased length of hospital stay by 10 days (95 % CI 3. 87 to 16. 29). There was a high degree of noncompliance in the largest study of <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> indicating dissatisfaction with this method by staff and/or parents. The one trial of a tube alone approach significantly reduced 'no breastfeeding or only partial breastfeeding' and 'no breastfeeding at all' at all time periods but the results need to be interpreted with caution due to the high risk of bias. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Supplementing breast <b>feeds</b> by <b>cup</b> confers no breastfeeding benefit beyond discharge home and delays discharge considerably. There is currently insufficient evidence on which to base recommendations for a tube alone approach to supplementing breast feeds. Further research is needed to evaluate a tube alone approach.

METHODS: Forty-eight newborn preterm infants with gestational age less than or equal to 36 6 / 7 weeks, weighting < 2500 grams and with stable respiratory pattern participated in this study. The newborns were divided into two groups: group A (35 newborns) with bottle feeding, and group B (13 newborns) with <b>cup</b> <b>feeding.</b> Speech-Language Pathology monitoring was organized in Stage 1 (non-nutritive sucking in "gloved finger" or "empty breast" concomitant with enteral feeding); Stage 2 (oral feeding offer - maternal breast, bottle or cup - with complement provided by enteral feeding); Stage 3 (exclusive oral feeding offer - maternal breast, bottle or cup); Stage 4 (effective breastfeeding offer). A comparison was carried out between the groups regarding the number of days in each phase. Data were statistically analyzed using the independent t-test, with significance level of 5 %.

Objectives To identify the effects of avoidance of bottle feeds during establishment of breast feeding on the likelihood of successful breast feeding, and to assess the safety of alternatives to bottle feeds. Search methods We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 2), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to July 2016), Embase (1980 to July 2016) and CINAHL (1982 to July 2016). We also searched databases of clinical trials and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing avoidance of bottles with use of bottles in women who have chosen to breast feed their preterm infant. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. When appropriate, we contacted study authors for additional information. Review authors used standard methods of The Cochrane Collaboration and the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. Main results We included seven trials with 1152 preterm infants. Five studies used a <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> strategy, one used a tube feeding strategy and one used a novel teat when supplements to breast feeds were needed. We included the novel teat study in this review, as the teat was designed to more closely mimic the sucking action of breast feeding. The trials were of small to moderate size, and two had high risk of attrition bias. Adherence with <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> was poor {{in one of the}} studies, indicating dissatisfaction with this method by staff and/or parents; the remaining four <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> studies provided no such reports of dissatisfaction or low adherence. Meta-analyses provided evidence of low to moderate quality indicating that avoiding bottles increases the extent of breast feeding on discharge home (full breast feeding typical risk ratio (RR) 1. 47, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 19 to 1. 80; any breast feeding RR 1. 11, 95 % CI 1. 06 to 1. 16). Limited available evidence for three months and six months post discharge shows that avoiding bottles increases the occurrence of full breast feeding and any breast feeding at discharge and at six months post discharge, and of full (but not any) breast feeding at three months post discharge. This effect was evident at all time points for the tube alone strategy and for all except any breast feeding at three months post discharge for <b>cup</b> <b>feeding.</b> Investigators reported no clear benefit when the novel teat was used. No other benefits or harms were evident, including, in contrast to the previous (2008) review, length of hospital stay. Authors' conclusions Evidence of low to moderate quality suggests that supplementing breast <b>feeds</b> by <b>cup</b> increases the extent and duration of breast feeding. Current insufficient evidence provides no basis for recommendations for a tube alone approach to supplementing breast feeds.

However, thus far, those who care for infants have not been provided with detailed information on what emergency preparedness entails. Emergency management authorities should provide those who care for infants with accurate and detailed information on the supplies necessary {{to care for them}} in an emergency, distinguishing between the needs of breastfed infants and the needs of formula fed infants. Those who care for formula fed infants should be provided with detailed information on the supplies necessary for an emergency preparedness kit and with information on how to prepare formula feeds in an emergency. An emergency preparedness kit for exclusively breastfed infants should include 100 nappies and 200 nappy wipes. The contents of an emergency preparedness for formula fed infants will vary depending upon whether ready-to-use liquid infant formula or powdered infant formula is used. If ready-to-use liquid infant formula is used, an emergency kit should include: 56 serves of ready-to-use liquid infant formula, 84 L water, storage container, metal knife, small bowl, 56 feeding bottles and teats/cups, 56 zip-lock plastic bags, 220 paper towels, detergent, 120 antiseptic wipes, 100 nappies and 200 nappy wipes. If powdered infant formula is used, an emergency preparedness kit should include: two 900 g tins powdered infant formula, 170 L drinking water, storage container, large cooking pot with lid, kettle, gas stove, box of matches/lighter, 14 kg liquid petroleum gas, measuring container, metal knife, metal tongs, <b>feeding</b> <b>cup,</b> 300 large sheets paper towel, detergent, 100 nappies and 200 nappy wipes. Great care with regards hygiene should be taken in the preparation of formula feeds. Child protection organisations should ensure that foster carers responsible for infants have the resources necessary to formula feed {{in the event of an}} emergency. Exclusive and continued breastfeeding should be promoted as an emergency preparedness activity by emergency management organisations as well as health authorities.

40|$|Background: Preterm infants have an {{immature}} sucking {{behavior and}} the capacity to be exclusively breastfed may be reduced for a period of weeks or months, depending on gestational age. Nipple shields have been used, not only as a device to help mothers with sore nipples, but also to facilitate the infant’s latch on to the breast. However, the benefits of using nipple shields have been debated. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore perceptions and experiences of using a nipple shield among parents and staff in neonatal units in Sweden and England. Methods: An ethnographic study was undertaken where observations and interviews were conducted in four neonatal units in Sweden and England. The data were analyzed using a thematic networks analysis. Result: The global theme was developed and named, ‘Nipple shield in a liminal time’. This comprised of two organizing themes: ‘Relational breastfeeding’ and ‘Progression’. ‘Relational breastfeeding’ was underpinned by the basic themes, ‘good enough breast’, ‘something in between’ and ‘tranquil moment’. ‘Progression’ was underpinned by the basic themes, ‘learning quicker’, ‘short-term solution’ and ‘rescue remedy’. Although breastfeeding was seen primarily as a nutritive transaction, the relational aspects of breastfeeding were of crucial importance. These two organizing themes show the tension between acknowledging the relational aspects of breastfeeding and yet facilitating or supporting the progression of breastfeeding in the period from tube <b>feeding</b> or <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> to breastfeeding. It is a liminal time as mothers and their infants are “in between” phases and the outcome, in terms of breastfeeding, is yet to be realized. Conclusion: This study demonstrates parents’ and staffs’ perceptions of the nipple shield as a short term solution to help initiation of breastfeeding but also as a barrier between the mother and infant. It is important that the mother and baby’s own particular needs are taken into account, in a person-centred way and on an ongoing basis. Furthermore, we need to emphasise the importance of the ‘relational’ whilst understanding the need for ‘progression’. Holding these in balance may be the key to appropriate use of the nipple shield...|$|R

Participants 319 preterm infants (born at 23 - 33 weeks’ gestation) {{randomly assigned to one of}} four groups: cup/no dummy (n = 89), cup/dummy (n = 72), bottle/no dummy (n = 73), bottle/dummy (n = 85). Women with singleton or twin infants < 34 weeks’ gestation who wanted to breastfeed were eligible to participate. Interventions: <b>Cup</b> or bottle <b>feeding</b> occurred when the mother was unable to be present to breast feed. Infants randomised to the dummy groups received a dummy on entry into the trial. Main outcome measures: Full breast feeding (compared with partial and none) and any breast feeding (compared with none) on discharge home. Secondary outcomes: prevalence of breast feeding at three and six months after discharge and length of hospital stay. Results: 303 infants (and 278 mothers) were included in the intention to treat analysis. There were no significant differences for any of the study outcomes according to use of a dummy. Infants randomised to <b>cup</b> <b>feeds</b> were more likely to be fully breast fed on discharge home (odds ratio 1. 73, 95 % confidence interval 1. 04 to 2. 88, P = 0. 03), but had a longer length of stay (hazard ratio 0. 71, 0. 55 to 0. 92, P = 0. 01).

There is insufficient {{evidence to support the}} practice of cup-feeding to supplement breastfeeding. However, it has beenapplied as a substitute for bottle-feeding to promote breastfeeding. The aimsof this study were to explore the differences in infant sucking competence,infant sucking behavior and maternal milk supply among babies who wereexclusively breastfeeding (breast group), breast <b>feeding</b> with <b>cup</b> supplementation (cup group) and breast-feeding with bottle supplementation (bottlegroup) at different periods postpartum. Methods: A longitudinal study was carried out at a medical center located in northernTaiwan. The cup and bottle groups were recruited at two different times toavoid interaction. The breast group consisted of infants who were fullybreastfed and were never exposed to a bottle or a cup during the hospitalstay. Two hundred and five healthy mothers and their full-term, singletoninfants were eligible for enrollment. We used structured questionnaires andmade observations to obtain information on breastfeeding at the first breastfeeding and the third day after birth, and then followed up these cases at twoand four weeks. Results: The bot t l e group wa s s igni f i c ant ly mor e f r e t ful dur ing br e a s t f e eding(p <. 01). Mothers in the bottle group perceived that their milk supply wasless sufficient than those in breast and cup groups (p <. 01). Conclusions: Some indicators of breastfeeding were similar in the breast and cup groups. Cup-feeding was better than bottle-feeding when supplementary formula wasneeded for medical treatment...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{the present}} study were to assess the {{practices}} of breastfeeding supplementation methods, and to explore the opinions and beliefs of health professionals with regard to breastfeeding supplementation methods and the nipple confusion phenomenon. The study was cross-sectional in design, and participants were recruited from five hospitals in Toronto, Ontario. All of the nurses and attending paediatricians in postpartum floors and level II nurseries were {{invited to participate in the}} study. A total of 87 nurses and 16 paediatricians completed the survey questionnaire. Bottle feeding was the most common breastfeeding supplementation method used in the nurseries followed by <b>cup</b> <b>feeding.</b> Only 15. 0 % of the level II nurses agreed that frequent bottle feeds lead to the nipple confusion phenomenon, compared with 44. 4 % of the postpartum nurses and 56. 2 % of the paediatricians. Findings demonstrated considerable variation in the practices and beliefs surrounding supplementation methods. A randomized controlled trial comparing the safety, efficiency and subsequent breastfeeding rates of different breastfeeding supplementation methods is warranted...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a {{minimally}} invasive technique to evaluate respiratory patterns in preterm infants during feeding. Methodology:Respiratory flow was obtained with a pneumotachograph coupled initially to a mask and then to a prong, both with a differential pressure transducer. Respiratory plethysmography was used to measure thoraco-abdominal movements. This recording allowed calibration of thepreterm infant’s tidal volume prior to feeding experiments. Electromyography was used to monitor oral muscle move-ments through electrodes attached to the buccinator, masseter and mentalis mus-cles. A pulse oximeter and cardiac monitor were used for continuous monitoring of vital signs. The infants were positioned vertically in a semi-sitting position in an in-fant seat. Results:The methodology developed here was considered effective in achieving the proposed aims. With the integrationof all these systems, it was possible to evaluate the respiratory patterns of preterm infants during <b>cup</b> <b>feeding.</b> Conclusion:This method allows the analysis of respiratory flow, volume, and O 2 saturation during feeding and identification of the moment in which a change in breathing occurs (i. e., pausing or feeding). This method is minimally invasive, providing the preterm infant with an environment that is as close to normal as possible...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{measure and}} compare the {{activity}} of the masseter, temporalis and buccinator muscles in different infant feeding methods. Method: Cross-sectional study of 60 full-term infants with no intercurrent diseases, aged between two and three months, classified into the following groups: 1) exclusive breastfeeding; 2) breastfeeding plus bottle-feeding; and 3) exclusive breastfeeding plus <b>cup</b> <b>feeding.</b> Surface electromyography was performed during infant feeding. The Krushal-Wallis test was used, complemented by multiple paired comparisons of the groups. A 5 % significance level was chosen for the tests. Results: Statistically higher results were verified in the breastfeeding group in relation to the bottle-feeding one, both in the range of movement and the mean contraction of the masseter. With regard to the temporalis muscle, statistically higher results were found in the breastfeeding group comparatively to the bottle-feeding one. As to the buccinator muscle, statistically higher results were observed in the breastfeeding group in relation to the bottle-feeding one, although in this case, the difference concerned only the range of contraction. Conclusion: The similarities between the muscle activity in the breastfeeding and in the cup-feeding groups suggests that cup-feeding can be used as an alternative infant feeding method, being better than bottle-feeding, due to the hyperactivity of the buccinator muscle, which could result in changes to the structural growth and development of the stomatognathic system functions.

40|$|A {{treatment}} {{package was}} used to induce and maintain swallowing with three infants who did not swallow food or liquid. Prior to treatment, they received all nutrition and hydration via gastrostomy tube feedings. The treatment package consisted of least-to-most intrusive physical prompts, an eliciting stimulus, contingent social reinforcement, and repeated trials to induce and maintain swallowing. The design combined elements of reversal and changing criterion designs for all three infants. The package was applied across <b>feeding</b> devices (nipple, <b>cup,</b> spoon), situations (liquid, pureed foods), and persons (trainer, primary nurses, mothers). The number of swallows or ounces per feeding (from 0 to 8 ounces) {{and the number of}} feeding sessions per day (from one to five) were progressively increased. In each case, the infant received baseline conditions alternated with the treatment package. Follow-up probes were done at 15 months, 21 months, or 24 months, respectively, after the last phase for the three patients. The package was successful in that the gastrostomy tube was no longer needed for Patients 1 and 3. Patient 2 maintained functional swallowing responses but received supplemental gastrostomy feedings because of unrelated medical problems. Results are discussed in terms of the need to isolate components of the package. The package can be used in cases in which the preexisting treatments (reinforcement with preferred foods, force-feeding) are not feasible because of age, physical fragility, or the lack of a swallowing response following the presentation of food...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} assess mother's/caregiver's understanding, {{practical}} application and cultural acceptability of a preliminary set of South African food-based dietary guidelines (FBDGs) for children aged 6 – 12 months {{living in the}} Little Karoo area of the Western Cape Province. Design: An observational, descriptive and cross-sectional study design was followed. Focus group interviews, recorded on videotape, were analysed for qualitative data. Quantitative questionnaires measured knowledge and comprehension of guidelines, perceived constraints to compliance with and importance of guidelines as well as socio demographic data prior to the focus group interviews. Setting Afrikaans-, English- and Xhosa-speaking communities of the Little Karoo area of the Western Cape Province of South Africa, including the urban areas of Oudtshoorn, Bongulethu, Bridgton, Toekomsrus and the adjacent rural areas of Dysselsdorp, Calitzdorp, Uniondale, Ladismith and Zoar. Subjects: Sixty-four mothers or caregivers to infants 6 – 12 months of age {{were included in the}} sample. Results Information obtained through the questionnaires supported what was said during discussions. Although perceived as important by the majority of respondents, some of the guidelines were not well understood without prior explanation. Such guidelines were those pertaining to meal frequency and <b>cup</b> <b>feeding,</b> while application of the guideline to prolonged breast-feeding seemed the most problematic. Conclusions: The FBDGs for this age group will have to be supported by extensive and appropriate educational material to be effective when introduced to the public. The fact that the applicability of the guideline to prolonged breast-feeding seemed to be the most problematic is a cause for concern...|$|R
40|$|Objective. The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the knowledge, attitudes and practices of women regarding the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programme at a community health centre (CHC), Method. A descriptive study was conducted using an administered, structured questionnaire. Subjects and setting. Thirty-six educated women aged 18 - 39 years and attending the clinic took part. Participants were from informal settlements and mostly unemployed, receiving government grants. Results. The majority (88. 9 %) scored 80 % or more with regard to general HIV knowledge. Although the majority (78 %) were formula feeding, primarily owing to their HIV status and convenience while working, 24 % would not be able to sustain this feeding method after the initial 6 months' free supply provided by the provincial health services. The majority could not define the terms exclusive breastfeeding (89 %), mixed feeding (81 %) or <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> (94 %) correctly. Attitudes were found to be positive with regard to both breastfeeding and formula feeding, but HIV status influenced it significantly (p < 0. 1). Conclusion. In conclusion, certain aspects of the PMTCT programme appear to have been effective at the CHC included in this study. The women were knowledgeable about HIV transmission and mother-to-child transmission (MTCT), but they were uninformed about certain essential aspects, i. e. prevention, cure and infant feeding. Attitudes were similar towards breastmilk or formula milk as a feeding choice but were influenced by HIV status. It was indicated that an informed decision-making process was not followed, rather that the women were advised to formula feed. Sustainability of formula feeding after 6 months and training of health workers specifically regarding feeding options need to be addressed. Articl...|$|R
40|$|Background : Health {{care workers}} are {{important}} in the promotion, protection and support of breast feeding. Their ability to do this {{may be influenced by}} their knowledge, personal experiences and work. Patients and Method: The breast feeding experience of 36 female medical doctors who had babies within the preceding two years and had resumed work was evaluated using a semi-structured self administered questionnaire. Result: All respondents knew that babies should be exclusively breast fed {{for the first six months}} of life but only 60 % knew that breast feeding should continue until two years. The exclusive breast feeding rate for the studied doctors was 11. 1 %. Before their babies were six months old, about 75 % of respondents had resumed work whilst over 50 % had started taking calls. Most could not breast feed during working or call hours. Alternative feeds during working or call hours included expressed breast milk in 34. 4 % and infant formula in 21. 9 %. Feeding bottle was the major method (77. 4 %) for feeding these alternatives. Work schedule was rearranged to allow breast feeding in only 27. 3 % of respondents. Conclusion: Failure to carry out exclusive breast feeding, the use of infant formula and feeding bottles (rather than <b>cup</b> <b>feeding)</b> are practices that may be inimical to the practice of breast feeding in society in general. The suboptimal breast feeding experience in these doctors and the identified knowledge deficits may limit their effectiveness in promoting and supporting breast feeding among their patients and communities. Female medical personnel should be empowered to carry out optimal feeding of their own infants...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT-The study {{determined}} {{the efficacy of}} protocols employed in replacement/artificial feeding using commercial infant formula. The study {{was carried out in}} the different suburban locations of Harare, Zimbabwe. A sample size of 20 mothers/caregivers giving commercial infant formula to their babies at between 0 - 6 months was targeted; convenience and snowball sampling techniques were used to identify the participants. Interviews using a structured questionnaire were conducted and complemented by direct observation of the participants as they prepared the infant formula. The results were tallied against a checklist of recommended practices and label instructions. The results established that there were short falls in the preparation procedures as employed by the caregivers, mainly the mixing order of powder and water, temperature of the water for reconstitution and handling of left over formula after feed; 50 percent of caregivers were not adhering to the label instructions as given by the manufacturers and to recommendations proposed by World Health Organisation. Poor hand washing was indicative in 80 percent of cases, bottle feeding was predominant (n = 16) compared to <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> (n = 4) and the population practicing artificial feeding were mostly the young (90 %), married (80 %), educated (100 %) and working group (90 %). The researcher recommends that health providers strengthen efforts to ensure that adequate information /counselling and consistent advice of optimal benefit to the infant-mother pair be given and that the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare, Nutrition unit must strictly monitor the activities and the information given out by infant formula manufacturers as stipulated by the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes and also giving them the responsibility of following up on the appropriate use of their products...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of neonatal dysphagia is increasing, as medical advances {{contribute to the}} survival of critically ill and preterm infants. Additional factors such as low birth weight (LBW), gastroesoephageal reflux disorder (GERD), failure to thrive (FTT) and exposure to HIV may increase the complexity of dysphagia symptoms. Knowledge of context-specific risk factors for dysphagia in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) may lead to an effective pathway of diagnosis and management in vulnerable neonates. Objective: The objective was to describe the feeding characteristics and categories of underlying medical conditions in 24 to 42 week gestational age infants while still in the NICU and who were referred for feeding and swallowing assessment. Method: The study was a retrospective investigation of 231 purposively selected medical and speech-language therapy records. Participants had a mean stay of 28. 5 days in the NICU of a peri-urban public hospital and all had feeding concerns. An existing seven-category framework for the classification of suspected dysphagia was used. Results: Feeding characteristics of the participants demonstrated that 65. 0 % had previous enteral tube (NGT/OGT) feeding, and only 15. 6 % were referred for instrumental assessments such as a VFSS by doctors or speech-language therapists (SLTs). The majority of participants used a mixed manner of <b>feeding</b> such as <b>cup</b> and breastfeeding, or <b>cup</b> and syringe <b>feeding.</b> Only 29. 7 % of participants was able to breastfeed exclusively which was an indication of feeding difficulties as the hospital where the study was conducted promotes exclusive breastfeeding. Results indicated that the majority of participants (90. 04 %) presented with multiple medical conditions. Underlying neurological conditions (48. 48 %) and feeding difficulties secondary to systemic illness (65. 80 %) contributed mostly to suspected dysphagia in the sample. It was found that 70. 99 % of infants presented with feeding difficulties secondary to other conditions such as LBW and prematurity, highlighting the need for an expanded dysphagia classification framework. Conclusion: The results are in agreement with the outcomes of previous research and confirm the need for a unique classification framework for dysphagia in South Africa. Neonatal dysphagia is a complex condition and frequently associated with multiple risk factors. Dissertation (M Communication Pathology) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017.

40|$|OBJETIVO: Mensurar e comparar a atividade dos músculos masseter, {{temporal}} e bucinador em diferentes métodos de alimentação de lactentes. MÉTODO: Estudo transversal, com participação de 60 lactentes nascidos a termo e sem intercorrências, entre 2 e 3 meses de idade, divididos em três grupos: 1) aleitamento materno exclusivo; 2) aleitamento misto com uso de mamadeira; e 3) aleitamento materno exclusivo com uso de copo. Foi realizada eletromiografia com eletrodos de captação de superfície durante a alimentação. O teste estatístico utilizado é o Kruskal-Wallis, complementado com as comparações múltiplas entre pares de grupos, e todas as discussões são realizadas no nível de 5 % de significância. RESULTADOS: Verificam-se maiores resultados no grupo de aleitamento materno em relação ao grupo de aleitamento por mamadeira, tanto na amplitude quanto na média de contração do músculo masseter. No que se refere ao músculo temporal, há resultados maiores na amplitude do grupo de aleitamento materno e na média de contração do grupo de aleitamento por copo, quando comparados ao grupo de aleitamento por mamadeira. Quanto ao músculo bucinador, observam-se resultados maiores no grupo de aleitamento por mamadeira com relação ao aleitamento materno, sendo que tal diferença ocorre apenas na amplitude de contração. CONCLUSÃO: As semelhanças entre a atividade muscular do grupo de aleitamento materno e aleitamento por copo permitem sugerir o uso do copo como método alternativo na alimentação de lactentes, ao contrário do aleitamento por mamadeira, devido à hiperfunção do músculo bucinador, podendo resultar em alterações motoras orais e das funções neurovegetativas.
