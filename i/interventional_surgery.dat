30|$|Clinical {{application}} {{is a new}} classification criterion that has been seldom related in the previous studies. As shown in Table  2 and Table  3, vascular <b>interventional</b> <b>surgery</b> is {{the most widely used}} field of the PMs. The main reason is that the centerlines, bifurcations and edge points of blood vessels can be used directly as the source of the feature points. Vascular <b>interventional</b> <b>surgery</b> of different vessels has different standards in the acquisition of feature points. For abdominal aortic vasculature, the vasculature diameter is very large, and centerline cannot describe the vessel structure precisely, so the edges of vessels are usually extracted as the source of the feature points. For liver vessels and vessels of other organs, diameters of these vessels are narrow and have limited influence on the registration accuracy, so the centerline of the vessel can directly serve as the origin of feature point sets.|$|E

Little is known, however, about the complications that patients experience after such treatment. We retrospectively reviewed the hospital records of 82 patients with new dysplastic oral lesions or early invasive oral SCCs treated by laser surgery in the maxillofacial unit at Newcastle General Hospital. The most common postoperative complications were pain {{for more than two}} weeks after operation (n = 28), bleeding (n = 4), difficulties with speech (n = 5), paraesthesia of the lingual nerve (n = 17), difficulty swallowing (n = 2), obstructive swelling of the submandibular gland (n = 22), and tethering of the tongue (n = 10).

40|$|Virtual reality-based {{simulators}} {{are very}} helpful for trainees {{to acquire the}} skills of manipulating catheters and guidewires during the vascular <b>interventional</b> <b>surgeries.</b> In the development of such a simulator, however, {{it is a great}} challenge to realistically model and simulate deformable catheters and guidewires in an interactive manner. We propose a novel method to simulate the motion of catheters or guidewires and their interactions with patients' vascular system. Our method is based on the principle of minimal total potential energy. We formulate the total potential energy in the vascular interventional circumstance by summing up the elastic energy deriving from the bending of the catheters or guidewires, the potential energy due to the deformation of vessel walls, and the work by the external forces. We propose a novel FEM-based approach to simulate the deformation of catheters and guidewires. The motion of catheters or the guidewires and their responses to every input from the interventionalist can be calculated globally. Experiments have been conducted to validate the feasibility of the proposed method, and the results demonstrate that our method can realistically simulate the complex behaviors of catheters and guidewires in an interactive manner...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{effective}} {{geometric modeling}} of vascular structures {{is crucial for}} diagnosis, therapy planning and medical education. These applications require good balance with respect to surface smoothness, surface accuracy, triangle quality and surface size. Methods Our method first extracts the vascular boundary voxels from the segmentation result, and utilizes these voxels to build a three-dimensional (3 D) point cloud whose normal vectors are estimated via covariance analysis. Then a 3 D implicit indicator function is computed from the oriented 3 D point cloud by solving a Poisson equation. Finally the vessel surface is generated by a proposed adaptive polygonization algorithm for explicit 3 D visualization. Results Experiments carried out on several typical vascular structures demonstrate that the presented method yields both a smooth morphologically correct and a topologically preserved two-manifold surface, which is scale-adaptive to the local curvature of the surface. Furthermore, the presented method produces fewer and better-shaped triangles with satisfactory surface quality and accuracy. Conclusions Compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, our method reaches good balance in terms of smoothness, accuracy, triangle quality and surface size. The vessel surfaces produced by our method are suitable for applications such as computational fluid dynamics simulations and real-time virtual <b>interventional</b> <b>surgery.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|Management of oral precancerous lesions remains polarised between <b>interventional</b> <b>surgery</b> and {{conservative}} treatment. We have previously shown {{the efficacy of}} carbon dioxide laser excision for both {{diagnosis and treatment of}} oral precancerous lesions. The aim {{of this study was to}} review the clinicopathological details of a group of patients in whom pre-existing but occult invasive carcinoma was diagnosed histopathologically in specimens excised by laser. We retrospectively reviewed 169 patients who attended the Maxillofacial Dysplasia Clinic at Newcastle General Hospital with single, new oral premalignant lesions over a 5 -year period (2004 - 2008). They were all treated by laser excision of lesions that were confirmed to be dysplastic from examination of preoperative incisional biopsy specimens. There was a significant correlation between the results of diagnostic incisional, and laser excision, biopsy specimens (p < 0. 01), but 15 patients had signs of occult invasive carcinoma in the excision specimens (9 %). In all cases the carcinomas were completely excised by the laser. Carbon dioxide laser excision is not only an effective treatment of precancerous lesions, but also facilitates early diagnosis and management of oral carcinoma at a stage when it is otherwise clinically undetectable.

40|$|Â© 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Background: Contemporary {{potentially}} malignant disorder {{management is}} based upon provisional histological diagnosis followed by <b>interventional</b> <b>surgery</b> to excise or ablate 'high-risk' mucosal lesions. Although the majority of patients achieve disease-free status post-treatment, others develop further or persistent disease unresponsive to intervention. Methods: A detailed, retrospective clinico-pathological review of treatment resistant potentially malignant lesions, from a 590 patient cohort treated by CO 2 laser surgery and followed for a mean of 7. 3 years, was undertaken. Clinical outcome was determined at study census date (31 December 2014). Results: A total of 87 patients (15 %) exhibited PMD disease resistant to treatment: 34 (6 %) became disease free following further treatment, whilst 53 (9 %) had persistent disease despite intervention. Disease-free patients were younger, changed lesion appearance from erythroleukoplakia to leukoplakia (P =. 004), developed further lesions at new sites, demonstrated reduction in dysplasia severity with time and required multiple treatments to achieve disease-free status (P =. 0005). In contrast, persistent disease patients were older, male, often presented with proliferative verrucous leukoplakia (PVL) on gingival and alveolar sites, displayed less severe dysplasia initially and underwent laser ablation rather than excision (P =. 027). Conclusion: Despite clinico-pathological profiling of treatment resistant patients, the precise inter-relationship between the inherent nature of potentially malignant disease and the external influence of treatment intervention remains obscure.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} wound degree and ovarian {{function}} of ultrasound interventional and laparoscopic surgeries for ovarian cyst pediculotorsion. Methods: Patients with ovarian cyst pediculotorsion admitted to Affiliated Hospital of Hebei University from May 2012 to August 2015 were selected. Patients underwent emergency ultrasound interventional operation were allocated into ultrasound intervention group and patients underwent laparoscopic surgery were allocated into laparoscopic group. The patients' conditions of two groups in perioperative period were compared. Before and after operation, the serum contents of total bilirubin, albumin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), interleukin- 1 b (IL- 1 b) and IL- 6 were measured respectively. Serum contents of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone and estradiol were measured at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after operation. Results: The operation time of ultrasound intervention group was shorter (P 0. 05). There {{was no significant}} difference in the recurrence rate after operation (P > 0. 05). There {{was no significant difference}} in the serum contents of TNF-a, IL- 1 b, and IL- 6 before and after operation in ultrasound intervention group (P > 0. 05).

Constituting 65 % of head and neck anomalies in isolated or syndromic forms, they are considered as the most common head and neck congenital deformities in children. Methods: 15 children from the Tabriz Children Hospital were evaluated in this descriptive-analytic cross sectional study that possessed unilateral and bilateral cleft lip and palate with inclusion criteria. The effect of nasal floor reconstruction on the size of alveolar cleft and palatal anterior fistula formation were evaluated in primary unilateral and bilateral cleft palate. Results: There were 11 (73. 3 %) male and only 4 (26. 7 %) female patients in the sample group. The mean duration from first consult to reconstructive surgery was 3. 4 ± 1. 8 months (1 to 9 months range). The width of alveolar cleft and alveolar ridge angle on cleft side compared to normal side in sagittal and coronal axis was significant after nasal floor reconstruction (P= 0. 001, P= 0. 02), while septal angle changes were not significant (P= 0. 26), which means no increase in septal deviation has been documented.

Patients with symptomatic bone metastases were referred to BMC and assessed by a team of specialists in various disciplines – interventional radiology, orthopedic surgery, palliative medicine, and radiation oncology. At initial consultation, patient demographics, reasons for referral, and case disposition were recorded. From January 1999 to February 2005, a total of 272 patients with bone metastases were referred to the BMC.
