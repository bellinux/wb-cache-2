25|$|When the Abarcas left Iguala {{after the}} mass {{kidnapping}} in September 2014, law enforcement began an investigation to locate all the properties {{owned by the}} couple and their families. Abarca had several properties in Guerrero and in other states, but authorities believed that he was hiding in Mexico City or Monterrey, Nuevo León. After ruling out Monterrey as a possible hideout, authorities concentrated on three properties in Iztapalapa where they believed the couple was hiding. Through the couple's real estate businesses, authorities were also able to link Berumen to the family once more and locate her properties in Iztapalapa. In one of the properties, investigators noticed something unusual: they regularly saw a woman (now known to be Berumen) <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a property that {{was thought to be}} abandoned. Authorities then mounted an investigation and surveillance operation on Berumen before finally entering the property and arresting Abarca and Pineda.|$|E

[...] He also believed that his good start was fortunate, as it was the first one he had made in the new Benetton car; the team had not practised starts previously due to being short of time. He also specified his evasion of Barrichello's slowing car in the pit-lane entry while making his first stop as a crucial moment of the race. Coulthard admitted that he had been affected by his tonsillitis: [...] "I wasn't able to match Michael and Damon's pace so I settled for running my own race".

500|$|While in {{the comics}} Shaw's {{absorption}} power was depicted by having him {{grow up to}} ten times his original size, First Class instead does what company Digital Domain called a [...] "kinetic echo", where a digital Kevin Bacon would be rippled, deformed and at times multiplied in repeated [...] "iterations" [...] that appear in a short period, to [...] "see [...] displace and deform in a kinetic and organic way". According to Dykstra, {{the biggest problem with}} Frost's diamond body was depicting it [...] "without looking like she was made of Jell-o or the polygon model of a human being". The morphed Frost, which the visual effects tried to make look more like a faceted crystal than glass, was rotomated into Jones in the live-action plates, while still retaining the actress' eyes and lips. As the character kept on <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her diamond form, a motion capture tracking suit could not be employed, so instead the effects team used both gray and chrome balls and a jumpsuit covered in mirrors—which also served as a lighting reference. For Angel's digital wings, the animators studied slow-motion footage of dragonflies to create the wing pattern in a realistic way, and the designers added iridescence to [...] "make the wings prettier". The visual of Banshee's screams was done through a digital ring-like structure based on renderings of sound waves such as Schlieren photography. The visual for Havok's blasts employed similar rings, concentrated in beams or rings of light which were then match moved into Till's mimed throwing. For Banshee's flight, the visual effects team used digital doubles only for distant shots, with closer ones employing Jones shot in a special flight rig. Azazel's teleporting was made to resemble the [...] "inky smoky effects" [...] used with Nightcrawler, who appeared in X2 and is Azazel's son in the comics. However, while Nightcrawler only left a smoke trail, the visual effects team had Azazel accompanied by digital fire and smoke [...] "because he was more closely aligned with the devil". The fire was also used [...] "as a mask to hide or reveal the body", according to effects supervisor Matt Johnson. Since the visible part of whirlwinds are the dust and dirt sucked up by them, the ones Riptide produces were made to resemble [...] "a tornado of gas, made out of nothingness" [...] by visual effects supervisor Nicolas Aithadi. The final product was mostly a practical effect made with dry ice, which was augmented by computer-generated imagery. The visual effects team portrayed Mystique's abilities slightly differently due to this being a younger version, with [...] "the scales being slightly longer and the transformation being slightly showier than when she became the more mature Rebecca." [...] For Beast, computer graphics depicted his simian-like feet, the transformation sequence, and a few facial replacements for when Beast opened his mouth wider than the mask on Hoult's face allowed.|$|E

2500|$|Louis Besumer and his {{mistress}} Harriet Lowe were attacked {{in the early}} morning hours of June 27, 1918, in the quarters at the back of his grocery which was located at the corner of Dorgenois and Laharpe Streets. Besumer was struck with a hatchet above his right temple, which resulted in a possible skull fracture. [...] Lowe was hacked over the left ear, and found unconscious when police arrived at the scene. The couple was discovered shortly after 7 AM on the morning of the attack by John Zanca, driver of a bakery wagon who had come to the grocery in order to make a routine delivery. [...] Zanca found both Besumer and Lowe in a puddle of their own blood, both bleeding from their heads. The axe, which had belonged to Besumer himself, was found in the bathroom of the apartment. [...] Besumer later stated to police that he had been sleeping when he was bashed with the hatchet. Almost immediately, police arrested potential suspect Lewis Oubicon, a then 41-year-old African American man who had been employed in Besumer's store just a week before the attacks. [...] No evidence existed which could have proved the man guilty, yet police arrested him nonetheless, stating that Oubicon had offered conflicting accounts of his whereabouts on the morning of the attack. [...] Shortly after the attempted murder Lowe stated that she remembered having been attacked by a mulatto man, yet her statement was discounted by police due to her disillusioned state. Robbery was said to be the only possible explanation for the attacks, yet no money or valuables were removed from the couple's home. [...] Oubicon was later released as police were unable to gather sufficient evidence to hold him accountable for the crimes. [...] Media attention soon turned to Besumer himself, as a series of letters written in German, Russian, and Yiddish were discovered in a trunk at the man's home. [...] Police suspected that Besumer was a German spy, and government officials began a full investigation of his potential espionage. [...] Weeks later, after <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> consciousness, Harriet Lowe told police that she thought Besumer was in fact a German spy, which led to his immediate arrest. [...] Two days later Besumer was released, and two lead investigators of the case were demoted due to unacceptable police work. [...] Besumer was once again arrested in August 1918, after Harriet Lowe, who lay dying in Charity Hospital after a failed surgery, stated that it was he who had attacked her more than a month previously with his hatchet. [...] He was charged with murder, and served nine months in prison before being acquitted on May 1, 1919, after a ten-minute jury deliberation.|$|E
