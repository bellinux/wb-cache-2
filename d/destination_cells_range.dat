[...] School of Computing and Engineering. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2013 Wireless network sharing {{has been the}} principal idea in the recent developments of wireless communication systems not only for improvement in capacity, data rates and coverage area but when considering an emergency service model, establishing reliable communication is the foremost requirement. With the inception of cooperative relaying technology, a novel wireless relaying method of sharing the terminal node capabilities to forward the signal created a new paradigm to greatly {{improve the quality of}} the services and soon became the significant research area in 3 G/ 4 G cellular networks. The cooperative terminals (relays) exploit a larger form of space diversity to relay signals to destinations when placed in between source and destination to combat the effects of fading induced by multipath signal propagation. However, the position of the relay in between the source and destination plays a significant role in affecting the overall network performance. Our attempt in this thesis is to show how a cooperative relay can be used to provide improved coverage at the cell edge with certain reliability and also extend the cell radius by effectively positioning the relay. First, we investigate the famous 3 -node relay assisted cellular system model and study the receiver diversity combining results by changing the relay positions with a relay forwarding the signal using the amplitude and forward protocol (AAF). The figure of merit of the considered 3 -node system model is expressed in terms of Bit error rate (BER) and signal to noise ratio (SNR). The BER vs. SNR plots are computed for various linear receiver diversity combining techniques and are used to evaluate performance of the system. These results are also compared to the conventional cellular network performance with a single point-to-point link between source and destination. Second, we provide the problem formulation of the diversity results observed and solve to find the effective relay position with respect to the source and also compute the effective cell radius of the 3 -node system model. To compute effective relay position, we use the Bernardin's coverage area probability relation with cell radius at the cell edge of the source where the relay is assumed to be placed with its probability of successfully forwarding the signal conditionally depending on its cell edge probability. We have obtained results of the two above problem formulations using MATLAB simulations. We have emulated the cooperative relaying technique in a cellular system to achieve 2 nd order diversity when compared to the conventional cellular system. The BER vs. SNR plots for each of the combining techniques show the significant difference in the diversity results when the channel quality estimations are used compared to the other methods which don't. Signal to noise ratio combining (SNRC) and Estimated SNRC (ESNRC) perform 4 ≅ 5 dB better than the other combining methods provided their SNR estimation is accurate. The highest diversity order (2 nd) is achieved when the relay is placed close to the source and drops as the relay is moved towards the <b>destination.</b> <b>Cell</b> <b>range</b> extension results show that moving the relay to its optimal position between source and <b>destination</b> in a <b>cell</b> provides capabilities to extend the <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> to nearly 1. 5 times the cell radius of the source and still performs within the acceptable coverage area probabilities.

Aeration was shown to enhance the wetland cell 2 ̆ 7 s ability to remove not only nitrogen but also CBOD, COD, and phosphorus (retention) more effectively. There was a significant difference (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) in both total nitrogen and ammonia effluent concentrations comparing aerated to unaerated wetland cells, while no significance was found comparing planted and unplanted wetland cells. The effluent ammonia concentrations from the aerated wetland <b>cells</b> <b>ranged</b> from 2. 7 to 5. 7 mg N/L, while for unaerated <b>cells</b> effluent concentration <b>ranged</b> from 22 to 23 mg N/L.

30|$|The {{extension}} of the small cell size is achieved by selecting appropriate cell individual offset values for the handover measurements {{that are used to}} trigger the handover between radio cells. In the following, a <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> expansion of x dB corresponds to a handover that is triggered when the UE receive signal strength of the macro cell is x dB higher than the signal strength of the micro cell. The overall system performance is very dependent on the <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> expansion (CRE) parameter since this defines the load distribution between a macro cell and the underlying small cells. Since the load situation is very dependent on the location of the small cell and is varying heavily over time, a dynamic adaptation of the <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> expansion is an attractive solution to optimise the overall system performance.|$|R

40|$|The use of {{heterogeneous}} networks {{is on the}} increase, {{fueled by}} consumer demand for more data. The main objective of heterogeneous networks is to increase capacity. They offer solutions for efficient use of spectrum, load balancing and improvement of cell edge coverage amongst others. However, these solutions have inherent challenges such as inter-cell interference and poor mobility management. In heterogeneous networks there is transmit power disparity between macro cell and pico cell tiers, which causes load imbalance between the tiers. Due to the conventional user-cell association strategy, whereby users associate to a base station with the strongest received signal strength, few users associate to small cells compared to macro cells. To counter the effects of transmit power disparity, <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> expansion is used instead of the conventional strategy. The focus of our work is on load balancing using <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> expansion (CRE) and network utility optimization techniques to ensure fair sharing of load in a macro and pico cell LTE Advanced heterogeneous network. The aim is to investigate how to use an adaptive <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> expansion bias to optimize Pico cell coverage for load balancing. Reviewed literature points out several approaches to solve the load balancing problem in heterogeneous networks, which include, <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> expansion and utility function optimization. Then, we use <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> expansion, and logarithmic utility functions to design a load balancing algorithm. In the algorithm, user and base station associations are optimized by adapting CRE bias to pico base station load status. A price update mechanism based on a suboptimal solution of a network utility optimization problem is used to adapt the CRE bias. The price {{is derived from the}} load status of each pico base station. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated by means of an LTE MATLAB toolbox. Simulations were conducted according to 3 GPP and ITU guidelines for modelling heterogeneous networks and propagation environment respectively. Compared to a static CRE configuration, the algorithm achieved more fairness in load distribution. Further, it achieved a better trade-off between cell edge and cell centre user throughputs.

30|$|In [1], {{the authors}} discuss <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> {{expansion}} (CRE), {{which is a}} technique that adds a bias value to pico received power from PBSs during the handover as if pico <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> is expanded, and many studies focus on this topic [1, 3 – 9]. CRE can make more UEs to access the PBS even if the macro received power is stronger than the pico received power. However, those UEs that access the PBS whose pico received power is weaker than the macro received power are affected by {{a large amount of}} interference from MBS; such UEs are referred to as expanded region (ER) UEs [1]. Therefore, whenever CRE is used, inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) may be needed so as to eliminate the interference.|$|R
40|$|Summary The {{frequency}} of {{sister chromatid exchange}} (SCE) was measured in peripheral blood lymphocytes from control, healthy subjects and immunosuppressed recipients of cadaveric donor kidneys with and without skin cancer. The mean SCE frequency in 43 control subjects was 9. 2 per <b>cell</b> (<b>range</b> 5. 4 - 12. 3). In 30 transplant recipients with no history or evidence of cancer the mean SCE rate was 10. 3 per <b>cell</b> (<b>range</b> 5. 8 - 24. 5); four (13 %) of these patients had a mean SCE frequency outside the control range. In 7 transplant recipients with skin cancer, the mean SCE frequency was 14. 3 per <b>cell</b> (<b>range</b> 9. 1 - 19. 9). This was significantly (P< 0. 01) higher than the mean value of control subjects. The mean SCE frequencies in 3 of these 7 patients fell within the control range and in 4 of these patients was above the control range. These results suggest that some immunosuppressed kidney transplant recipients are liable to chromosomal damage. An increased incidence of cancer is well recognized in renal transplant recipients (Penn, 1979; Sheil et al., 1981).

The number of individuals N(t) is allowed to change over time. The matrix D_ℓ(t) might change over time because, in principle, the individual might change destination during his or her travel, and for simplicity we assume that - 1 ≤ D_ij≤ 0 for each individual. It is worth remarking that attracting cells are in general associated to destinations and should be encoded in the set of matrices D_ℓ(t), whereas repelling cells are associated to constraints and should be encoded only in the set of matrices C^α(t).|$|R
40|$|In {{diabetic}} patients, elevated plasma {{levels of}} t-PA and PAI- 1 accompany impaired fibrinolysis. To identify mechanisms for these abnormalities, we examined whether vascular endothelial cells exposed to high glucose upregulate t-PA and PAI- 1 production and whether ambient PA activity is decreased concomitantly. In 17 cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells grown to confluency in 30 mM glucose, the t-PA antigen {{released to the}} medium in 24 h was (median) 52 ng/ 106 <b>cells</b> (<b>range</b> 10 - 384) and the PAI- 1 antigen was 872 ng/ 106 <b>cells</b> (<b>range</b> 217 - 2074) -both greater (P < 0. 02) than the amounts released by paired control cultures grown in 5 mM glucose- 29 ng/ 106 <b>cells</b> (<b>range</b> 7. 5 - 216) and 461 ng/ 106 <b>cells</b> (<b>range</b> 230 - 3215), respectively. In the presence of high glucose, the steady-state levels of t- PA and PAI- 1 mRNAs were increased correspondingly (median 142 and 183 % of control, respectively, P < 0. 05); high glucose per se and hypertonicity contributed to the upregulation in additive fashion. The PA activity of conditioned medium from cultures exposed to high glucose was 0. 4 IU/ml (range 0. 2 - 0. 6), which was significantly lower (P < 0. 02) than the PA activity of control medium (0. 5 IU/ml, range 0. 2 - 0. 9). No difference was observed when comparing the PA activities of acidified conditioned media, expected to be depleted of inhibitors. Thus, high glucose coordinately upregulates endothelial t-PA and PAI- 1 expression through effects exerted at the pretranslational level and enhanced by even mild degrees of hypertonicity. The decrease in ambient fibrinolytic potential may reflect an overwhelming effect of the increased availability of PAI- 1. These findings propose a contributory mechanism for the fibrinolytic abnormalities of diabetes and the thrombotic tendency of the hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state...|$|R

The goal of our research is to provide a mathematical framework through which the percentage of HO for users moving with a known mobility pattern can be forecasted. By properly handling this information at the BSs, the network can better manage the resources and prepare the HOs, hence reducing the time needed to authenticate in the connection in the new cell and decreasing the probability of dropping the connection. However, how this prediction is used by the network is out of the scope of this article.|$|R
