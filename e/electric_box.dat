50|$|The {{conversion}} from {{a warehouse}} to a nightclub {{was designed by}} Mills Beaumont Leavey, a Manchester-based architect, who proposed to keep {{the main body of}} the building but to create a new extension in a Postmodernist style. Internally the building was split into five distinct areas; the Foyer, Main Room, <b>Electric</b> <b>Box,</b> the Lounge and the VIP Pod. The Building was constructed on sloping topography and therefore the five areas were on differing levels with Main room being the lowest, Lounge the highest with Foyer and <b>Electric</b> <b>Box</b> in-between. VIP shared the same floor space as Lounge.|$|E

5000|$|When he {{runs out}} of money, he heads into town to buy some essentials. He heads into the store Dusk 2 Dawn, where the locals mistaken him for the mysterious science guy {{who lived in the}} forest. They request for a tour of the shack that [...] "he" [...] lived in, {{offering}} money and at the thought of cash, Stan agrees, taking the name [...] "Stanford", the name of his absent brother. He shows the locals around his shack and tries to impress them with some of his brother's gadgets but they are not impressed (Susan Wentworth gets one of her eyes shocked by an <b>electric</b> <b>box,</b> causing it to close permanently, earning her the nickname [...] "Lazy Susan"). He comes up with some fake attractions and the locals find it amusing. So he converts the shack into a shack of fake attractions, dubbing it initially [...] "the Murder Hut", but later renaming it [...] "the Mystery Shack." [...] He even fakes his own death in a car crash in another state to get the cops off his scent. After searching for another employee to run the Shack that would be loyal to him, he finally does so when he finds Jésus [...] "Soos" [...] Ramirez, who, {{at the time of his}} employment, was only 12 years old. Soos grows to like his job and regards Stan like a surrogate father, especially after he tried to get his birthday removed from the calendar (a day in which Soos always grieves about his father not being able to come to his birthday party), causing Stan to no longer be allowed at the airport. Meanwhile, Stan would go to the lab at night and try to get the machine back on to rescue his long lost brother, a goal he finally accomplishes in the episode Not What He Seems.|$|E
5000|$|Back at the Donovan Corporation, Steppenwolf, Meg, Octavio, and Reggie {{are at the}} lab {{with the}} Heruka {{strained}} {{to get her back}} to Shelly's old form. Octavio told Reggie to perform a few more tests, before they will change her back. However, Reggie refuses and mocks them that Shelly will become [...] "worse than she already is". Reggie said he has waited long enough and told Octavio to get on with it. Octavio uses a syringe and injects the serum into the Heruka. The serum then appears to be working. The Heruka transforms back into Shelly. However, as she changed back, she's bald and has blue blood veins everywhere in her body. Steppenwolf and Meg become shocked that the creature is Shelly. However, the heart monitor has revealed something terrible. Octavio was afraid that it might happen: the initial transformation has caused too much damage [...] He is sorry that he said that he doesn't think she's going to make it. Reggie then mocks them by saying [...] "from the creature emerges the creator". Steppenwolf became very angry as he punches Reggie in the face so hard. Steppenwolf calls Reggie a bastard and yells at him for forcing Shelly to do this to herself. Suddenly, as Reggie got back up, there were huge cracks all over his face (which was the cosmetic that dried on his face). Meg then became frightened and angry as she told Reggie what was he hiding behind that [...] "mask". Steppenwolf then told Reggie what kind of monster is he. Reggie becomes very angry and tells both of them to shut up. He said he's seen enough of them and tells his minions to get rid of them. Steppenwolf and Meg run out of the lab and avoid the gunshots made by the minions. Steppenwolf told Meg to stay and he'll deal with the guards to get to the helicopter. After Steppenwolf killed the three guards, he and Meg rushed to the helicopter, but the Albino and two guards arrive and they shoot the flying helicopter and it falls next to a dam. However, both have survived and they found a passageway at the dam where it will help them get off the island. Steppenwolf and Meg soon find a guard at the dam. Steppenwolf distracted the guard by throwing a distress flare at the controllers. As the guard extinguishes the fire, Steppenwolf sneaks behind him and kills the guard with a single punch in the face. Steppenwolf presses a button which makes a platform for Meg to cross over the chasm. Steppenwolf told Meg to hide here and said he'll clear the way to get them off the island. Suddenly, the Albino appears and chases Steppenwolf. Steppenwolf heads to one of the holes with huge running water and he gets out of their and grabs a vine and climbs. He then takes the vine and ties it on a rock. Steppenwolf then climbs on a thick branch and finds a closed passage. Steppenwolf calls Meg to open the passage. After she opens the passage, Steppenwolf enters and sees the Albino. The assassin accidentally shot an <b>electric</b> <b>box,</b> which cause the damaged wires to have electricity coming out. Steppenwolf uses the rock and liana on a pipe and swings and kicks the Albino as he drops his gun into the chasm of water. He jumps on Steppenwolf to strangle him, but he uses a distress flare and the Albino backs away. However, he doesn't give up. The Albino takes a huge pipe and tries to impale him. Steppenwolf, however, ducks and the Albino accidentally sticks the pipe into the <b>electric</b> <b>box</b> and gets electrocuted by the high voltage and he falls to his death into the giant drain, putting an end on him once and for all. However, two of the guards have kidnapped Meg. They take her to Reggie and Octavio. We now see that Reggie no longer has dry cosmetic cracks on his face, but he has huge wrinkles all over his face with brown spots and wrapped with band aids. Octavio quietly takes the PDA. Reggie tells his guards to kill Meg if she tries to escape again. Reggie tells everyone to leave and now he has his [...] "little treasure/baby", which is a syringe that has a serum combined with the Mokele Mbembe, the Yeti, the Kraken, and the Chupacabra's blood. Octavio tells him to wait a while, but Donovan refuses and forces Octavio to leave, unless if he cares to become the next X-Creature. Octavio quickly leaves. Now that Donovan has all the samples, he mixes them to create a mutation serum and puts it in a syringe and he will make himself a monster.|$|E
