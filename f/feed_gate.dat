40|$|Abstract. A {{method was}} {{proposed}} which employs {{control of the}} drop location of fertilizer particles on a spinner disc to optimize the spread pattern uniformity. The system contained an optical sensor as a feedback mechanism, which measured discharge velocity and location, as well as particle diameters to predict a spread pattern of a single disc. This pattern was combined with a mirrored pattern from a second disc to produce a complete transverse pattern of a dual disc spreader. Subsequently, the transverse pattern was used in simulations in which the patterns from both spinner disc were rotated about the disc center, which in practice is achieved by rotating segment type gates {{such as in the}} Vicon Rotaflow spreader. The transverse patterns were overlapped in software and the resulting overlapped patterns {{as a function of the}} gate angles were evaluated using three criteria, which filter offset patterns, non-robust patterns and patterns with a high sensitivity in CV around a chosen swath width. This led to maps where each gate setting was related to a quality of the spread pattern for a single mass flow value. The optimally uniform pattern was found at the minimum of the quality map. When the mass flow rate changes, the whole process needs to be repeated and a new optimal gate setting found to produce the optimal pattern at the new mass flow rate. The power of the <b>feed</b> <b>gate</b> adaptation method was shown in simulations as well as using real data from a Sulky spinner disc spreader...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTime budgets (TB) of {{lactating}} Holstein cows in a freestall {{loose housing}} system were recorded twice in {{early and late}} lactation to study genetic and phenotypic variation in TB. Time budget traits were recorded using focal animal scanning at 10 -min intervals for full 24 -h sessions. The study included 243 first-lactation cows, with 389 TB records in early lactation (50 to 123 d in milk) and 403 records in late lactation (152 to 248 d in milk). Milk was recorded at 3 -wk intervals during the same periods, and yield was expressed as energy-corrected milk. Time budget traits were analyzed with mixed linear models to obtain estimates of genetic variation (heritability) and permanent animal variance (repeatability). Correlations between TB traits and energy-corrected milk yield were estimated at the individual cow level. In early lactation, the cows spent, on average, 5. 0 h eating and 1. 8 h at <b>feed</b> <b>gates</b> without eating {{while they were still}} locked in the gates. Cows lay down for 10. 4 h and stood in stalls for 3. 2 h. The cows also spent 2. 8 h standing in aisles, but only 0. 5 h in the milking area. In late lactation, cows spent 1 h more lying, but less time standing in stalls and less time eating and at the <b>feed</b> <b>gates.</b> Time budget traits were moderately repeatable although highly consistent across lactation stages. Estimates of heritability were moderate for eating time (0. 20) but almost zero for lying time. Correlations showed that cows with higher yield spent more time eating and less time lying. As there is a trade-off between lying time and eating time, lying time approached lower limits for cows with highest yields. It is suggested that time is viewed as an important but restricted resource that cows may be short of while trying to maintain high yields...|$|R

40|$|Quality of {{diecasting}} components {{is strongly}} influenced by the fluid-dynamics filling. Consequently, a good design of the die cavity is fundamental to avoid turbulence, resulting in casting defects, and to allow the production of very complex castings. Particularly, the gate system {{is one of the}} most important mould part to be controlled, to guarantee an effective die filling. Commercial software for the simulation of mould filling and casting solidification represent an important tool of analysis and a good help for a correct design. The aim of this work is to define the effect of the gating system geometry on the energy loss during filling of diecasting dies and also on their pattern flow. The study was approached by the use of two numerical simulation software: Calcosoft® (specific for 2 D problem) and Procast. The attention was focused on fan <b>feed</b> <b>gates,</b> considered to be the most widely used in high pressure diecasting. The first part of this paper describes the research of a relationship between energy dissipation and gate design, in terms of gate convergence angle, section thickness, sketch, etc [...] Initially a few 2 D simple geometries, characterized by different shape, were investigated, considering a typical aluminun-silicon alloy for the data needed for simulation. Subsequently, as a function of the results previously obtained, the study was extended also to 3 D geometries, to evaluate the effect of the fan feed shape, of the ratio between runner and gate sections and finally of the runner width/thickness ratio. A first important result obtained by the simulation analysis is that an optimization of the gating system cannot be obtained through the variation of a single parameter; a compromise must be researched in order to take into account the interaction between every factor. So, small variation ranges, for each geometrical parameter, were fixed to avoid bad configurations of the gate-runner system. In other words, guidelines for a good diecasting die design were attained. To validate the results achieved, the approach was extended also to a real geometry of a diecasting die for the realization of flat tensile strength samples of different thickness, demonstrating a performance improvement of about 30 %. The design guidelines obtained are nowadays used for the realization of an experimental diecasting mould for future tests...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{a two-year}} project, DE-FC 07 - 011 D 13983 that concerns the gating of aluminum castings in permanent molds. The main {{goal of the}} project {{is to improve the}} quality of aluminum castings produced in permanent molds. The approach taken was to determine how the vertical type gating systems used for permanent mold castings can be designed to fill the mold cavity with a minimum of damage to the quality of the resulting casting. It is evident that somewhat different systems are preferred for different shapes and sizes of aluminum castings. The main problems caused by improper gating are entrained aluminum oxide films and entrapped gas. The project highlights the characteristic features of gating systems used in permanent mold aluminum foundries and recommends gating procedures designed to avoid common defects. The study also provides direct evidence on the filling pattern and heat flow behavior in permanent mold castings. Equipment and procedure for real time X-Ray radiography of molten aluminum flow into permanent molds have been developed. Other studies have been conducted using water flow and behavior of liquid aluminum in sand mold using real time photography. This investigation utilizes graphite molds transparent to X-Rays making it possible to observe the flow pattern through a number of vertically oriented grating systems. These have included systems that are choked at the base of a rounded vertical sprue and vertical gating systems with a variety of different ingates into the bottom of a mold cavity. These systems have also been changed to include gating systems with vertical and horizontal gate configurations. Several conclusions can be derived from this study. A sprue-well, as designed in these experiments, does not eliminate the vena contracta. Because of the swirling at the sprue-base, the circulating metal begins to push the entering metal stream toward the open runner mitigating the intended effect of the sprue-well. Improved designs of sprue-wells should be evaluated. In order for a runner extension to operate efficiently, it must have a small squared cross-section. If it is tapered, the first metal to enter the first metal to enter the system is not effectively trapped. If the cross section is large, there is less turbulence when the aluminum enters the mold cavity in comparison to the smaller cross sectioned, squared runner. However, a large runner reduces yield. In bottom-feeding gating systems, a filter can significantly improve the filling of the casting. The filter helps to slow the metal flow rate enough to reduce jetting into the mold cavity. In top <b>feeding</b> <b>gating</b> systems, a filter can initially slow the metal flow rate, but because the metal drops after passing the filter, high velocities are achieved during free fall when a filter is in place. Side <b>feeding</b> <b>gating</b> systems provide less turbulent flow into the mold cavity. The flow is comparable to a bottom-feeding gating system with a filter. Using properly designed side-gating system instead of a bottom-feeding system with a filter can potentially save the cost of the filter. Rough coatings promote better fill than smooth coatings. This conclusion seems at first counter intuitive. One tends to assume a rough coating creates more friction resistance to the flow of molten metal. In actuality the molten aluminum stream flows inside an oxide film envelope. When this film rests on top of the ridges of a rough coating the microscopic air pockets between the coating and the oxide film provide more thermal insulation than in a smooth coating. This insulation promotes longer feeding distances in the mold as demonstrated in the experiments. Much of this work is applicable to vertically parted sand molds as well, although the heat transfer conditions do vary from a metal mold generally used in permanent molding of aluminum. The flow measurements were conducted using graphite molds and real time X-Ray radiography recorded at a rate of 30 images per second through those molds. The facilities at Arrow Aluminum Foundry were used in the study. The results will be employed to demonstrate to the American Foundry Industry how molten aluminum flows in permanent molds of different designs and characteristics. The results of these experiments were compared with computer mold and simulation models. The Procast and Magmasoft flow and solidification simulation programs were employed to predict the flow behavior under the different conditions that can prevail in permanent mold gating. The development of a valid computer model that can correctly and accurately predict this flow is much more intricate than generally realized. To provide accurate predictions such programs require significant adjustments and verification with experimental data...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of fully automatic milking systems (AMS) on dairy farms can only succeed if cows visit the system {{more or less}} voluntarily, at regular intervals. This can be arranged by either forced or free cow traffic. In the case of forced cow traffic, the AMS is the only route from the lying area to the feeding area. An alternative is free cow traffic, where the cows can decide whether to visit the AMS or not. The behaviour in 3 x 20 crossbred Holstein Friesian dairy cows in three experiments (experiment Ia, Ib and II) was studied in a cubicle house with a selection system consisting of a selection stall and a concentrate feeder, simulating an AMS. Cows could obtain 250 g of concentrate in the system once every six hours. Actual milking occurred in a conventional milking parlour twice a day. Experiment Ia consisted of (1) a reference phase with no use of the selection system, (2) free cow traffic, (3) forced cow traffic, and (4) a reference phase. Experiment Ib was a repetition of experiment Ia. Experiment II was divided into (1) a reference phase with no use of the selection system, (2) forced cow traffic with two one-way passages between the feeding and lying areas, (3) forced cow traffic with one one-way passage, (4) free cow traffic with one free passage between the feeding and lying areas, and (5) free cow traffic with two such passages and (6) a reference phase. The number of visits paid to the selection system by individual cows appeared to be consistent in the different phases in each experiment (r = 0. 52 in experiment I (P < 0. 05); r = 0. 68 − 0. 86 (P < 0. 01) in experiment II). In experiments Ia and Ib, cows seemed to visit the selection system more often during forced cow traffic than during free cow traffic, but this was {{because some of the}} cows did not visit the system at all during free cow traffic. Therefore, the differences were not significant. In experiment II, cows paid the same number of visits to the selection system during different types of cow traffic, but when two passages were open during free cow traffic, the cows visited the system less (P < 0. 01). During forced cow traffic, cows spent more time standing on the slatted floor in the feeding area, spent less time standing at the <b>feeding</b> <b>gate</b> and made less journeys from the lying to the feeding area (significant in two of three experiments; P < 0. 01). It was concluded that forced cow traffic may improve the frequency of visits to the AMS, but somewhat restricts the cows' behaviour, and may, therefore, be questionable. Free cow traffic could work if cows are previously conditioned to take the route to the AMS...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} was to determine effects of feeding increasing levels of a Yucca schidigera extract (YSE) to dairy cows on 24 h in vitro gas production and 27 h in vitro neutral detergent fibre (aNDFom) digestion of 11 common dairy feedstuffs, {{as well as in}} vivo rumen fermentation and performance of the cows to which the YSE was fed. The principle was to use YSE to potentially modify the rumen microbial population in vivo and measure subsequent impacts of the adapted rumen fluid on feedstuff fermentation in vitro. Four rumen cannulated late lactation Holstein cows (810 ± 54. 7 kg body weight) were used in a 4 × 4 Latin Square design experiment with 14 d periods. Cows were housed in pens with individual <b>feeding</b> <b>gates</b> and had ad libitum access to water while fed a total mixed ration (TMR) of alfalfa hay, corn grain, barley grain, dried distillers grains, whole cottonseed, beet pulp, soybean meal, almond hulls, rumen inert fat and a mineral/salt mixture. Based upon sarsaponin assay of four commercial YSE products, Monterey Sarsaponin 15 ® was selected and added to the TMR to provide 0, 5, 10 or 15 g of sarsaponin/cow/d. Rumen fluid from each cow in each period was utilized for in vitro gas determinations to measure gas production and aNDFom digestion from the test feeds. There was a strong linear effect (P= 0. 002), at an increasing rate (quadratic P= 0. 08), to increased extent of gas production with increased feeding of YSE. There was a quadratic effect to maximum rate of gas production (P= 0. 01) at the 5 g sarsaponin level. At 4 h of fermentation, gas production increased linearly (P< 0. 05), at an increasing rate (P< 0. 002), for almond hulls, barley grain and soybean meal with increasing levels of YSE. Gas production from barley grain had a quadratic effect (P< 0. 01), suggesting a maximum at about the 5 g sarsaponin feeding level. Gas production at 24 h of fermentation increased linearly (P= 0. 03), at a decreasing rate (P< 0. 03), but only soybean meal had a quadratic tendency (P= 0. 08) to minimum gas production at about the 5 g level of sarsaponin. In vitro fermentation ofaNDFomat 27 hwas not impacted by treatment. In vivo rumen pH, concentrations of total volatile fatty acids and rumen protozoal counts were not impacted by YSE feeding level, as were milk production, milk components and net energy (NE) balance. However, correlations between NE output and the proportional increases in 4 h gas production with increasing levels of YSE in the diet suggest that this measure may be predictive of animal responses to this YSE. Finally, multivariate analysis, used to create equations to predict impacts of the nutrients in the 11 feedstuffs on their proportional increase in 4 h gas production, suggests that the increase in 4 h gas production of any feed may be predicted from its organic nutrient profile, offering the potential to determine the optimal feeding level of sarsaponin in any TMR based on its nutrient profile...|$|R

A representative sample of 10 certified (i. e., ASC and GLOBALG. A. P.) and 10 non-certified intensive Pangasius farms in the Mekong Delta was investigated. Detailed LCA results, resulting in resource consumption in terms of the Cumulative Exergy Extraction from Natural Environment (CEENE), showed that pond water renewal and feed production, particularly agriculture-based feed ingredients, were the hotspots.

40|$|The {{design of}} a {{mechatronic}} agent capable of navigating autonomously in a changing and perhaps previously unfamiliar environment is a very challenging issue. This thesis addresses this issue from both functional and system perspectives. Functions such as spatial representation, localization, path-finding and collision avoidance are essential to autonomous agentn. Four types of learning related to these functions {{have been identified as}} important: sensory information categorization and classification, the learning of stimulus-response mapping, the learning of spatial representation and the coding and adaptation of the travel experience with regard to specific tasks. It is argued that, in order to achieve a high degree of autonomy at the system level, it is essential to implement each of these navigational functions with a highly autonomous learning technique. An analysis of several representative artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms for their degrees of autonomy and computational characteristics indicates that none of the learning techniques analyzed is alone sufficient in terms of spatial learning. It is shown that biology can be inspirational in finding a possibly better, or perhaps more complete, solution to the learning of spatial representation than previous engineering or ANN based approaches. In particular, data on the biological head direction system have inspired the generation of a computational model which is shown {{to be able to use}} learned environmental features to correct the directional error accumulated by dead-reckoning in a simulated mobile robot. Furthermore, using a hippocampal place learning system in biological systems as an inspiration, a network model of dynamic cell structure is suggested. It allows an autonomous agent to perform tasks such as environmental mapping, localization and path-finding. In this model, a focus mechanism is included to help minimize computation needs by directing the adaptation of the network and the pathfinding. The thesis also discusses various approaches toward achieving a high degree of autonomy at the system level. It is also shown that a <b>feed</b> forward <b>gating</b> mechanism can be combined into a layered design framework to accommodate the interaction between various navigational functions having high degrees of autonomy...|$|R

With the increasing usage of portable devices, there are severe restrictions being placed on the size, weight and power of batteries.

40|$|A key {{goal for}} {{livestock}} science {{is to ensure}} that food production meets the needs of an increasing global population. Climate change may heighten this challenge through increases in mean temperatures and in the intensity, duration, and spatial distribution of extreme weather events, such as heat waves. Under high ambient temperatures, livestock are expected to decrease dry matter intake (DMI) to reduce their metabolic heat production. High yielding dairy cows require high DMI to support their levels of milk production, but this may increase susceptibility to heat stress. Here, we tested how feed intake and the rate of converting dry matter to milk (feed efficiency, FE) vary in response to natural fluctuations in weather conditions in a housed experimental herd of lactating Holstein Friesians in the United Kingdom. Cows belonged to 2 lines: those selected for high genetic merit for milk traits (select) and those at the UK average (control). We predicted that (1) feed intake and FE would vary with an index of temperature and humidity (THI), wind speed, and the number of hours of sunshine, and that (2) the effects of (1) would depend on the cows' genetic merit. Animals received a mixed ration, available ad libitum, from automatic <b>feed</b> measurement <b>gates.</b> Using > 73, 000 daily feed intake and FE records from 328 cows over 8 yr, we found that select cows produced more fat- and protein-corrected milk, and had higher DMI and FE than controls. Cows of both lines decreased DMI and fat- and protein-corrected milk but, importantly, increased FE as THI increased. This suggests that improvements in the efficiency of converting feed to milk may partially offset the costs of reduced milk yield owing to a warmer climate, at least under conditions of mild heat stress. The rate of increase in FE with THI was steeper in select cows than in controls, which raises the possibility that select cows use more effective coping tactics. This is, to our knowledge, the first longitudinal study on the effects of weather on FE. Understanding how weather influences feed intake and efficiency can help us to develop management and selection practices that optimize productivity under unfavorable weather conditions. This will be an important aspect of climate resilience in future...|$|R
40|$|KAT 1 is a voltage-dependent inward {{rectifying}} K+ channel cloned {{from the}} higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana [Anderson, J. A., Huprikar, S. S., Kochian, L. V., Lucas, W. J. & Gaber, R. F. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89, 3736 - 3740]. It {{is related to}} the Shaker superfamily of K+ channels characterized by six transmembrane spanning domains (S 1 -S 6) and a putative pore-forming region between S 5 and S 6 (H 5). The 115 region between Pro- 247 and Pro- 271 in KAT 1 contains 14 additional amino acids when compared with Shaker [Aldrich, R. W. (1993) Nature (London) 362, 107 - 108]. We studied various point mutations introduced into H 5 to determine whether voltage-dependent plant and animal K+ channels share similar pore structures. Through heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes and voltage-clamp analysis combined with phenotypic analysis involving a potassium transport-defective Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, we investigated the selectivity filter of the mutants and their susceptibility toward inhibition by cesium and calcium ions. With respect to electrophysiological properties, KAT 1 mutants segregated into three groups: (i) wild-type-like channels, (ii) channels modified in selectivity and Cs+ or Ca 2 + sensitivity, and (iii) a group that was additionally affected in its voltage dependence. Despite the additional 14 amino acids in H 5, this motif in KAT 1 is also involved {{in the formation of the}} ion-conducting pore because amino acid substitutions at Leu- 251, Thr- 256, Thr- 259, and Thr- 260 resulted in functional channels with modified ionic selectivity and inhibition. Creation of Ca 2 + sensitivity and an increased susceptibility to Cs+ block through mutations within the narrow pore might indicate that both blockers move deeply into the channel. Furthermore, mutations close to the rim of the pore affecting the half-activation potential (U 1 / 2) indicate that amino acids within the pore either interact with the voltage sensor or ion permeation <b>feeds</b> back on <b>gating...</b>|$|R
40|$|Chaotic {{mixing of}} highly filled viscous fluids is desired but hardly {{achieved}} in the electronic packaging industries. The demand for high reliability found in electronic package attracts more and more researchers to study the properties and distribution of binders and filler particles. These will affect properties such as {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} and stiffness. Both of these contribute strongly to reliability. The filler concentration, size distribution and spatial distribution must be examined in a structured manner to understand their effects on final properties. However, most studies deal with filler concentration and size distribution, while very few studies have tied the particle spatial distribution to the properties. It is not enough to just properly control the filler concentration and size distribution. The more uniform filler distribution, the more uniform are local properties, and this can be achieved by well-designed mixing processes. Mixing is very important and in many cases the goodness of the mixing of fillers will affect or determine the properties of the products. In this thesis, the local properties of electronic package and their relations with filler particle distribution are quantified. For the first time, a new feed protocol that can generate chaotic mixing during filling cavity by implementing periodic and aperiodic filling process is presented. Instead of using single gate in the molding process, we have developed a two-gate feeding protocol. A numerical simulation experiment is conducted on a 2 -D square cavity to examine the mixing of polymer fluid in low Reynolds number flows. Since there are a vast number of geometries in electronic packages, only cavities with 46 and 49 bumps, which can be treated as solder balls or leadframe, is investigated. Periodic and aperiodic feed protocols resulted in exponential growth of the distance between two adjacent particles, an indication of chaotic mixing. Entropic study shows that the global mixing has been improved 858 % compared to single <b>gate</b> <b>feeding.</b> The improved properties and reliability could be foreseen in electronic package...|$|R
40|$|Identification of feed {{efficient}} cattle by {{determination of}} residual feed intake (RFI) of individual animals is both laborious and expensive (negative RFI value=efficient; positive RFI value=inefficient). A less costly method to predict RFI is needed. Knott et al. reported that rams with poor feed efficiency (positive RFI values) are {{more responsive to}} exogenous adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH); thus, we tested the hypothesis that response to an ACTH challenge in Brahman cattle is directly associated with RFI. Brahman bulls (n= 12) (390 ? 19 kg BW) and heifers (n= 12) (334 ? 12 kg BW), age 15 ? 1 mon, with established RFI values were used. To establish RFI, after the calves were weaned, they were evaluated in separate 70 d test periods for each gender during which the animals were limit fed (2. 65 % BW/d) in a Calan <b>gate</b> <b>feeding</b> system. The 6 lowest and 6 highest ranking of each gender, males and females, respectively, {{were used to assess}} cortisol response to exogenous ACTH, total n = 24. Blood samples were taken via indwelling jugular catheter every 15 min from 3 h prior to challenge through 4 h after challenge at time 0 h with ACTH (0. 1 IU/kg BW). Serum concentrations of cortisol were determined by radioimmunoassay using Coat-A-Count kits (intra-assay variation of 7. 7 % and inter-assay variation of 7. 6 %). Data were analyzed using GLM specific for repeated measures. Cortisol concentrations were affected by time (P 0. 10). Basal cortisol concentrations (M= 7 ? 1; F= 14 ? 2 ng/ml), peak cortisol concentrations (M= 37 ? 3; F= 64 ? 4 ng/ml), amplitude of responses (M= 31 ? 3; F= 49 ? 4 ng/ml), and area under the curves pre-challenge (M= 189 ? 30; F= 414 ? 60 ng/ml?h) differed (P< 0. 01) between genders. These data indicate that cortisol response to an ACTH challenge is not a useful predictor of RFI in Brahman cattle. However, a sexual dimorphism in the cortisol response to an ACTH challenge was detected in Brahman cattle...|$|R
40|$|A {{globalized world}} demands globalized companies. Hence, the study tries to picture, from the {{international}} perspective, the interaction between firms and their business collaborators. The purposes of the study are to analyse, {{from the perspective of}} the research participants and by contrasting theory and practice, how the addressed organisations manage their network collaborators to consolidate their international business market position and what is the overview of their internal practices to make decisions in terms of their cooperation strategy with other firms. The theory of this research is built upon three main pillars: networking, internationalization, and decision-making processes (DMPs). The literature of networking serves as a frame to introduce collaboration and DMPs as subjects of research. Besides, three of the strategy paradoxes are used as a rationale to build the frame of internationalization and decision-making processes. Thus, these three elements constitute the focus of interest of this study. The research counts on a deductive approach in which theory was being put into practice. The investigation was based on the study performed to 8 different multinational enterprises (MNEs) with 10 research participants in sectors related to Engineering and Technology businesses. The tool to gather the data was a survey composed by a multiple-choice questionnaire and a set of open questions. Furthermore, two semi-structured interviews were carried out to complement the surveys. The studied companies cooperate with other organisations on a functional basis, that is, those collaborators that satisfy their needs are the ones selected. Also their geographical location does not oppose a significant barrier to partner. The studied MNEs count on defined procedures and formalities to make decisions for choosing and working with these collaborators. However, the information <b>gates</b> <b>feeding</b> these processes are based on an individual or group level. Hence, the addressed individuals may apply informal methods to obtain such data. Furthermore, every business area and hierarchical level can have their own specialized network of partner collaborators. This fact also impacts the decision level in terms of cooperating. Thus, collaborators are an essential support for the addressed MNEs to ensure their business continuity in the international market...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} housing of {{veal calves}} in individual crates without roughage has received prolonged and serious criticism, since it denies the animals various social activities, {{freedom of movement}} and the possibility to consume roughage and to ruminate. In order to develop an economically acceptable alternative to this housing system, which would provide a significant improvement in calf welfare, the housing of calves in groups of five was evaluated with regards to husbandry, health and ethological aspects. The present study focussed mainly on the behaviour of the calves in individual crates and group pens (chapter IV) {{and it was only}} casually concerned with the production and health of the animals (chapter III). A major problem in the group pens was the occurrence of preputial sucking and urine drinking, which had a negative influence on production, health and behaviour. The development of these activities was described (chapter V) and several experiments concerning their prevention were presented (chapter VI). The influence on lying behaviour of the tethering of the calves during the first 6 - 8 weeks after arrival - as a preventive measure against preputial sucking and urine drinking - was studied in chapter VII. Finally, restrictions to particular lying postures in the crates were investigated with respect to their effect on sleep (chapter VIII). In five consecutive experiments, a total of 94 calves were housed in individual crates (1, 65 x 0, 65 m) and provided with 100 g straw/calf/day. whereas 99 calves were kept in groups of five in pens (2, 20 x 3, 83 m) on concrete slatted floors with straw bedding and an ad libitum supply of straw in baskets. The group housed calves were not tethered during the first weeks after arrival. In four other experiments, a total of 47 calves were housed in individual crates (1, 70 x 0, 70 m) and given 200 g straw cobs/calf/day from week 7 or 9 onwards, whereas 139 calves were kept in groups of five in pens (2, 40 x 3, 05 m) on wooden (and in some pens partly concrete) slatted floors. 1 kg straw cobs was supplied daily from week 7 or 9 onwards in one trough per group pen. During the first 6 weeks after arrival, the calves were tethered to the <b>feeding</b> <b>gate,</b> separated individually by partitions. All calves were male and predominantly black and white (FH x HF). In three out of the nine experiments, male red and white (MRY) calves were used. The influence of this breed difference was not discussed. The calves were fed a milk replacer in open buckets twice daily at approximately 8. 00 and 16. 00 h. In chapter III, limited data on production, health and labour requirements of the calves in these housing systems are reported, which provide a first impression on how individual crates and group pens compare. Growth rate (about 1200 g /day) and feed conversion (about 1, 5) of the calves slaughtered at a normal weight in group pens with and without straw bedding {{on the one hand and}} individual crates on the other were comparable and quite favourable. Slaughter quality, which was satisfactory in general, was also similar in these different housing systems. Haemoglobin levels at slaughter were fairly high (8 - 110 g/ 100 ml), but meat colour was still acceptable. A relatively large number of group housed calves, however, died or had to be culled or eliminated. The total of these losses amounted to 10, 1 % in the group pens with straw bedding, against 4, 3 % in the corresponding crates; in the group pens with slatted floors the total losses were 9, 4 % against 2, 2 % in the crates. These high losses in the group pens mainly occurred because in this housing system it was difficult to treat diseased calves individually (for example by supplying a medicinated milk replacer) since they were often pushed away by penmates. When disregarding these losses, the health status of the calves, as measured by the frequency and duration of the different medical treatments imposed,seemed no worse in the group pens than in the individual crates. In the group pens, the provision of 23, 3 kg strawlcalf for feeding and 106, 3 kg straw/ calf for bedding took 138, 7 min/calf in total during the entire fattening period, against 32, 6 min/calf for supplying 7, 1 kg straw/calf in the individual crates. In the group pens with bare slatted floors and the corresponding crates, the total amount of straw cobs provided from week 9 onwards (13 - 14 kg/calf) and the time required to do this (15 - 17 min/calf) were about equal. In the first series of experiments, when the calves were tethered for the first 6 weeks after arrival, preputial sucking did not occur. The muzzling of preputial suckers was not satisfactory, since it obstructed smelling, licking and the intake of straw and moreover, it did not stop the ingestion of urine. Abomasal lesions (erosions, ulcers, scars), which were mainly located in the pyloric region, were observed in calves housed in individual crates and group pens alike. In only 14 - 37 % of the animals, the abomasums were not affected by lesions. It was concluded that group housing with or without straw bedding is not incompatible with fast growth, favourable feed conversion and adequate slaughter quality. The high losses in the group pens may perhaps be reduced by restraining the calves at feeding with a self- yoking <b>feeding</b> <b>gate,</b> which facilitates not only the treatment of illnesses but also their detection. The latter seems particularly valuable on practical farms, when health inspection is not as intensive as in the present study. The supply and removal of straw as a bedding is extremely labour intensive and therefore wooden slatted floors without straw are preferred in further research. The study of the causation and prevention of preputial sucking and urine drinking has a high priority, since preventive tethering restricts freedom of movement, social contact and exploratory behaviour. In chapter IV, it was investigated to what extent calves in individual crates were restricted in their behaviour in comparison to calves in group pens and how they dealt with their situation. For this purpose, the behaviour of the same calves whose production characteristics were described in the previous chapter was registered. Observations were carried out on all individual calves in both housing systems over one period of 23 hours (24 hours with exception of feeding periods) in weeks 8, 12, 16 and 20 after arrival by means of instantaneous sampling in 10 minute intervals. Subsequently, an analysis of variance was executed to calculate the average frequency and trend for each behaviour and both housing systems were compared on the basis of these parameters. The percentages quoted are close approximations of average values over the second series of four experiments (with group pens on slatted floors without straw bedding and the corresponding crates). The calves in the crates spent more time lying than those in the group pens (74 against 68 %). This is probably above all the result of a greater variety of stimuli in the group pens, but occasional mounting and treading of penmates may also have contributed to this difference. Lying on the side or on the brisket with both hindlegs stretched in the group pens amounted to 2 and 8 % of total lying time respectively. Lying was severely restricted by the sidewalls of the crates and consequently, these postures only rarely occurred in the crates at the end of the fattening period. It is argued that these restrictions may interfere with the relaxation of the body. Moreover, these limitations seemed to affect behavioural thermoregulation; the crated calves regulated heat loss by stretching their forelegs forwards during lying (27 % of total lying) or by bending them under the body, whereas the group housed calves increased or decreased body. contact with the floor often by stretching and bending their hindlegs instead of their forelegs (hindlegs stretched: 10 % of total lying; forelegs stretched: 15, 5 % of total lying). Lying with the head turned backwards, which is the usual posture for supporting the head (in the group pens 20 - 25 % of total lying) became increasingly restricted in the individual crates towards the end of the fattening period. In the crates, the duration of this lying posture as a proportion of total lying decreased from 25 % in week 8 to 5 % in week 20. Although the head was supported forwards on the floor more often (10 % instead of 5 % of total lying) or against the partitions (1 - 2 % of total lying), the duration of lying with the head supported was clearly reduced in the crates in comparison to the group pens: 16 % and 30 % respectively. The latter percentage includes lying with the head on penmates in the group pens (5 % of total lying). Since supporting the head is necessary for the relaxation of the neck muscles during certain states of sleep, the restriction of these tying postures in the crates may interfere with sleep as a physiological process. Furthermore, the licking of the belly, back, thighs or hindlegs (1, 7 % in the crates and 3, 2 % in the group pens) and the scratching of the head, neck or shoulders (0, 05 against 0, 16 %) were also hindered by the sidewalls of the crate, whereas rubbing (0, 6 - 0, 7 %) was not impaired. On the other hand, the licking of the forelegs (1, 0 against 0, 7 %) and the muzzle (1, 9 against 1, 1 %), which are easily accessible, was more frequently performed by the crated calves than by the group housed ones. The increase of the latter activities in the individual crates may be related to conflict situations. Self stretching was reduced in the crates as compared to the group pens (0, 14 against 0, 25 %). In the individual crates, physical interactions between neighbouring calves were usually limited to licking and sucking at feeding times when the front was opened, whereas in the group pens mutual licking occurred regularly throughout the day (2, 5 %) and head butting and mounting (together 1, 0 %)|$|R
30|$|Additional file  1 : Annexes 4 and 5 {{provide the}} {{correlation}} matrix between the simulated dietary feed {{components in the}} grower and finisher diets of the  CWSR model. This chart is presented to show {{the importance of the}} multi-stage LP modeling process in developing the relationship between dietary components in dietary simulation analyses. The figure clearly indicates that wheat inclusion is correlated with soy oil inclusion rates (corr.[*]=[*] 0.95 and R 2 [*]=[*] 0.90). On the other hand, there is a negative correlation between the inclusion of corn and that of soy oil (corr.[*]=[*]−[*] 0.96 and R 2 [*]=[*] 0.92). A similar correlation trend was found between these feeds in the grower and finisher diets. This is attributed to the low energy content in wheat versus corn grains, and therefore, additional dietary energy sources were provided by soy oil. Furthermore, the inclusion of wheat was negatively correlated with the inclusion of corn (−[*] 1.00), which is expected since in most cases the formulated diets where composed of one of these energy feeds. Furthermore, wheat inclusion had a negative correlation with RSM of −[*] 0.53 and a positive correlation found with Meth. Cyst. (0.88 in the starter diet and 0.75 in the grower diet) and a low correlation of 0.37 found in the finisher diet. These results indicate that in wheat-based diets, additional synthetic Meth. Cyst. is needed to meet the requirements when RSM is not used in the formulation. A similar conclusion can be drawn when testing the correlation between SBM and methionine. However, the negative correlation between RSM and Meth. Cyst. indicates that this byproduct is an interesting source to reduce expensive synthetic amino acids in diets. Simulated compound feed prices are presented in Additional file 1 : Annex 8. These prices will differ by location as they do not represent the farm <b>gate</b> <b>feed</b> price due to the omission of transportation and retailer costs, which are regionally dependent. Compared to a static and standard ration (corn and SBM based diet), using a multi-stage LP model, it is possible to generate a feed ration which, when looking at the year 2014, could give an average cost reduction of 8.8 USD per ton of starter feed, 4.6 USD per ton of grower feed, and 1.3 USD per ton of finisher feed (CSD model). This results in an average price reduction of 5.9 USD per ton of formulated feed. If we apply this price reduction for the year 2014, it results in a total cost reduction of 1.74 billion USD for starter, grower, and finisher feed combined, meaning that the broiler sector would have gained over 1.74 billion USD in 2014 benifiting from a monthly feed formulation and from inclusion of byproducts. Assuming a similar price reduction in layer chicken feed production, the magnitude of global poultry industry gain will increase up to 2.57 billion USD. The gain could be more than double if other livestock species are included in the analysis, given that the byproducts inclusion rate is of greater importance for ruminants. Using local byproducts may result in lower production costs and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, mainly associated with reduced transportation distances for feed inputs (Hristov et al. 2013).|$|R
