5|$|Evidence for the T cell-mediated {{mechanism}} of mucosal destruction is strong, but the exact triggers for this process are unknown and {{are thought to}} be multiple and varied from one person to the next. This suggests {{that there are a number}} of possible triggers, <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> capable of producing the disease in different subgroups. In other words, different subgroups appear to have different causes for the condition. These can be considered in three general groups, namely primary immuno-dysregulation, decrease of the mucosal barrier and states of heightened antigenic sensitivity (see below). Risk factors in aphthous stomatitis are also sometimes considered as either host-related or environmental.|$|E

5|$|In animals, the {{mitochondrial}} genome {{is typically}} a single circular chromosome that is approximately 16 kb long and has 37 genes. The genes, while highly conserved, may vary in location. Curiously, {{this pattern is}} {{not found in the}} human body louse (Pediculus humanus). Instead, this mitochondrial genome is arranged in 18 minicircular chromosomes, <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> 3–4 kb long and has one to three genes. This pattern is also found in other sucking lice, but not in chewing lice. Recombination has been shown to occur between the minichromosomes. The reason for this difference is not known.|$|E
5|$|In {{computer}} science, integer sorting is the algorithmic {{problem of}} sorting {{a collection of}} data values by numeric keys, <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> an integer. Algorithms designed for integer sorting may also often be applied to sorting problems in which the keys are floating point numbers, rational numbers, or text strings. The ability to perform integer arithmetic on the keys allows integer sorting algorithms to be faster than comparison sorting algorithms in many cases, depending {{on the details of}} which operations are allowed in the model of computing and how large the integers to be sorted are.|$|E

Orthodontic extrusion or orthodontic implant site development can be used in selected cases for vertical/horizontal alveolar augmentation.|$|E
5|$|Ramagya Prashna (रामाज्ञा प्रश्न), {{literally}} Querying the Will of Rama, is an Awadhi work {{related to}} both Ramayana and Jyotisha (astrology).

50|$|As {{from the}} {{beginning}} of the 15th century, the territory <b>of</b> <b>each</b> county was divided into processus <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>was</b> administered by one of the noble judges (there were therefore usually four in each county). The aim was to simplify the administration. The number of processus was increasing from the 18th century onwards, because the functions of the counties were increasing too. The processus, in turn, consisted of 2 to 6 circuits (Latin: circuli), <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>was</b> the responsibility <b>of</b> a deputy noble judge.|$|R
5|$|The {{selection}} {{process for the}} IMO varies greatly by country. In some countries, especially those in east Asia, the {{selection process}} involves several tests of a difficulty comparable to the IMO itself. The Chinese contestants go through a camp. In others, such as the USA, possible participants go {{through a series of}} easier standalone competitions that gradually increase in difficulty. In the USA, the tests include the American Mathematics Competitions, the American Invitational Mathematics Examination, and the United States of America Mathematical Olympiad, <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> a competition in its own right. For high scorers in the final competition for the team selection, there also is a summer camp, like that of China.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} can procure various weapons, {{including}} melee weapons, pistols, shotguns, and alien weapons. Non-melee weapons degrade with use and will break {{if they are}} not regularly repaired with maintenance tools. There are a variety of ammunition types, <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> most damaging to a specific enemy. For example, organic enemies are vulnerable to anti-personnel rounds, while mechanical foes are weak against armor-piercing rounds. Similarly, energy weapons cause the most damage against robots and cyborgs, and the annelid-made exotic weaponry is particularly harmful to organic targets. Because ammunition is scarce, to be effective the player must use it sparingly and carefully search rooms for supplies.|$|E
5|$|An immaculate inning {{occurs in}} {{baseball}} when a pitcher in a half-inning of play throws only nine pitches, <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> a strike and thus strikes out three consecutive batters. Immaculate innings are uncommon, rarer than the better known individual gameplay feats of a batter's hitting for the cycle and a pitcher's no hitter. Currently 84 different Major League Baseball (MLB) pitchers have accomplished this feat {{for a total}} of 89 immaculate innings. The first one was pitched by John Clarkson of the Boston Beaneaters on June 4, 1889, in the third inning against the Philadelphia Quakers. Since then, only four players––Lefty Grove, Nolan Ryan, Randy Johnson, and Sandy Koufax––have thrown an immaculate inning more than once in their careers. Koufax is the only pitcher to throw three of them. A record eight immaculate innings have been thrown in the 2017 MLB season through August 8.|$|E

5|$|From {{the end of}} the pool, steps lead down to {{a smaller}} {{rectangular}} pool at right-angles to the first. The steps and the retaining wall at {{the end of the}} terrace are listed at GradeII. The retaining walls of the pool are also listed at GradeII. This area contains two statues by Jonathan Kenworthy. From this pool a path, known as the Broad Walk, stretches to the north and the south. At each end of the Broad Walk is a building designed by Waterhouse for the 3rdMarquess. At the north end is the Parrot House, dating from 1881–83, which is built in yellow terracotta. It is the form of a round colonnaded Ionic temple with a shallow domed roof. Above the colonnade and the inner drum are concentric balustrades. A flight of eleven steps leads up to the south entrance. The Parrot House is listed at GradeII. At the south end of the Broad Walk is a loggia, dating from about 1880. This is built in buff and red sandstone. At its front are three arches between Ionic columns. The loggia was built to enclose a Roman altar which was found in 1821 at a spring near Boughton and brought to Eaton in 1822. The loggia is listed at GradeII. To the east and west of the loggia are reconstructed Roman columns, <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> listed at GradeII.|$|E
5|$|Sonic Unleashed is a {{platform}} {{game in which}} the player controls the titular Sonic the Hedgehog in two modes: fast-paced levels that take place during daytime, showcasing Sonic's trademark speed as seen in previous games in the series, and slower, night-time levels, during which Sonic transforms into the Werehog, and gameplay switches to an action-based, brawler style of play, in which Sonic battles Gaia enemies (those created by the main enemy in the game, Dark Gaia). Each level takes place on a particular continent, <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> based on a real-world location. In sections of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game, the player may choose to advance {{the time of day}} in order to play as either Sonic or the Werehog; in the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions, time is advanced automatically.|$|E
