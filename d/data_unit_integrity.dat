40|$|<b>Data</b> <b>units</b> are the {{foundation}} for a new process interaction paradigm for distributed and multiprocessor systems. The <b>data</b> <b>unit</b> abstraction combines many of the strengths of RPC, distributed shared memory, and object-based approaches. It generalizes the concept of memory space to include structure information. When structure information is available, the underlying system can provide services such as transparent translation and support for dynamically linked data structures that span machine boundaries. This paper presents <b>data</b> <b>units</b> and their relationship to existing approaches. In addition, a prototype system based on <b>data</b> <b>units</b> is described, along with applications built using the <b>data</b> <b>unit</b> concept. These example applications demonstrate that <b>data</b> <b>units</b> are an e ective and e cient new tool for distributed systems. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a query {{framework}} for hypertext data in general, and for WWW pages, Netnews articles, and e-mails in particular. In existing query tools for hypertext data, such as search engines for WWW or intelligent news/mail readers, <b>data</b> <b>units</b> in query are typically individual nodes. In actual hypertext data, however, one topic {{is often described}} over a series of connected nodes, and therefore, the logical <b>data</b> <b>unit</b> should be such a series of nodes corresponding to one topic. This discrepancy between the <b>data</b> <b>unit</b> in query and the logical <b>data</b> <b>unit</b> hinders the efficient information discovery from hypertext data. To solve this problem, in our framework, we divide hypertexts into connected subgraphs corresponding to individual topics, and we use those subgraphs as the <b>data</b> <b>units</b> in queries...|$|R

40|$|The {{distributed}} applications require group communications among multiple entities. In the group communication, {{it is important}} to discuss in what order each entity in the group can receive <b>data</b> <b>units.</b> In order to realize fault-tolerant systems, the same events have to occur in the same order in each entity. The ordering among the events is known as a causal order. This paper presents a reliable causally ordering broadcast (CO) protocol which provides the same causal ordering of <b>data</b> <b>units</b> for all the entities in the group. In the CO protocol, the <b>data</b> <b>units</b> received are causally ordered by using the sequence numbers of the <b>data</b> <b>units.</b> The CO protocol is based on the fully distributed control scheme, i. e. no master controller, and uses high-speed networks where each entity may fail to receive <b>data</b> <b>units</b> due to the buffer overrun. Furthermore, the CO protocol provides asynchronous data transmission for multiple entities in the group...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} streaming packetized media over a lossy packet network, with sender-driven (re) transmission using acknowledgement feedback. The different transmission scenarios associated {{to a group of}} interdependent media <b>data</b> <b>units</b> are abstracted in terms of a finite alphabet of policies, for each single <b>data</b> <b>unit.</b> A rate-distortion optimized markovian framework is proposed, which supports the use of comprehensive feedback information. Contrarily to previous works in rate-distortion optimized streaming, whose transmission policies definitions do {{not take into account the}} feedback expected for other <b>data</b> <b>units,</b> our framework considers all the acknowledgment packets in defining the streaming policy of a single <b>data</b> <b>unit.</b> More specifically, the notion of master and slave <b>data</b> <b>unit</b> is introduced, to define dependent streaming policies between media packets; the policy adopted to transmit a slave <b>data</b> <b>unit</b> becomes dependent on the acknowledgments received about its masters. One of the main contributions of our work is to propose a methodology that limits the space of dependent policies for the RD optimized streaming strategy. A number of rules are formulated to select a set of relevant master/slave relationships, defined as the dependencies that are likely to bring RD performance gain in the streaming system. These rules provide a limited complexity solution to the rate-distortion optimized streaming problem, with comprehensive use of feedback information. Based o...|$|R
