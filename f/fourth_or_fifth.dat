5|$|A young white-bellied sea eagle in {{its first}} year is {{predominantly}} brown, with pale cream-streaked plumage on their head, neck, nape and rump areas. The plumage becomes more infiltrated with white until it acquires the complete adult plumage by the <b>fourth</b> <b>or</b> <b>fifth</b> year. The species breeds from around six years of age onwards. The lifespan is thought to be around 30 years.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian {{province}} of Alberta holds elections to its unicameral legislative body, the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. The maximum period between general elections {{of the assembly}} is five years, but the Lieutenant Governor is able to call one at any time. However, the Premier has typically asked the Lieutenant Governor to call the election in the <b>fourth</b> <b>or</b> <b>fifth</b> year after the preceding election. The number of seats has increased over time, from 25 for the first election in 1905, to the current 87.|$|E
5|$|Roebuck {{recorded}} {{three straight}} outs {{to end the}} inning without further scoring. The Dodgers and the Giants each managed a single in their halves of the third inning. Neither Pierce nor Roebuck allowed a baserunner in the <b>fourth</b> <b>or</b> <b>fifth</b> innings, though the Giants further added to their lead in the sixth. The Dodgers pinch hit for Roebuck to lead {{off the top of}} the inning with Ken McMullen and although he singled he did not score. Larry Sherry entered to pitch for the Dodgers in the bottom of the inning and after recording the first out he allowed back-to-back home runs to Mays and Orlando Cepeda to give the Giants a 5–0 lead. Davenport then singled and Sherry was relieved by Jack Smith who finished the inning without further damage.|$|E
25|$|That said, African music {{most closely}} adheres to Western tetratonic (three-notes), pentatonic (five-note), hexatonic (six-note), and heptatonic (seven-note) scales. Harmonization of the melody is {{accomplished}} by singing in parallel thirds, <b>fourths,</b> <b>or</b> <b>fifths.</b>|$|R

5|$|In December1994, CSU {{predicted}} that only 12named storms would form and 8of those would become hurricanes; 3major hurricanes were projected. CSU noted an above average season due to expectations {{that the existing}} El Niño would dissipate, while a La Niña would develop {{by the summer of}} 1995. Additionally, the western areas of the Sahara Desert were predicted to have the <b>fourth</b> <b>or</b> <b>fifth</b> rainiest season since 1970. A year with heavier precipitation in this region usually correlates with an active Atlantic hurricane season. In April1995, CSU revised their forecast, decreasing the number of named storms to 10, hurricanes to 6, and major hurricanes to 2. However, in June, CSU reverted to their December forecast, which called for 12named storms, 8hurricanes, and 3major hurricanes. The forecast by the WRC in early 1995 was 10named storms and 6hurricanes, with no prediction on the number of major hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the birds}} begin to forage on their own, they {{move away from}} their parents' territory; young birds have been found nearly 500km away from their nest site. One-year-old European birds migrate to Africa and stay there {{for at least one}} year. A vulture that fledged in France stayed in Africa for three years before {{migrating}} north in spring. After migrating back to their breeding areas, young birds move widely in search of good feeding territories and mates. The full adult plumage is attained in the <b>fourth</b> <b>or</b> <b>fifth</b> year. Egyptian vultures have been known to live for up to 37 years in captivity and at least 21 years in the wild. The probability of survival in the wild varies with age, increasing till the age of 2 and then falling at the age of 5. Older birds have an annual survival probability varying from 0.75 for non-breeders to 0.83 for breeding birds.|$|E
5|$|Other public bills {{could no}} longer be vetoed; instead, they could be delayed for up to two years. This two-year period meant that {{legislation}} introduced in the <b>fourth</b> <b>or</b> <b>fifth</b> years of a parliament could be delayed until after the next election, which could prove an effective measure to prevent it being passed. Specifically, two years had to elapse between the second reading in the House of Commons in the first session and the passing of the bill in the House of Commons in the third session. The Speaker has to also certify that the conditions of the bill had been complied with. Significant restrictions on amendments are made to ensure that it is the same bill that has been rejected twice. The 1911 Act made clear that the life of a parliament could not be extended without the consent of the Lords.|$|E

50|$|Around {{the end of}} the 9th century, singers in monasteries such as St. Gall in Switzerland began {{experimenting with}} adding another part to the chant, {{generally}} a voice in parallel motion, singing mostly in perfect <b>fourths</b> <b>or</b> <b>fifths</b> above the original tune (see interval). This development is called organum and represents the beginnings of counterpoint and, ultimately, harmony. Over the next several centuries, organum developed in several ways.|$|R

5|$|The {{demographic}} characteristics of the population of Croatia are known through censuses, normally conducted in ten-year intervals and analysed by various statistical bureaus since the 1850s. The Croatian Bureau of Statistics has performed this task since the 1990s. The latest census in Croatia was performed in April 2011. The permanent population of Croatia at the 2011 census had reached 4.29 million. The population density is 75.8 inhabitants per square kilometre, and the overall life expectancy in Croatia at birth was 78 years in 2012. The population rose steadily (with the exception of censuses taken following the two world wars) from 2.1 million in 1857 until 1991, when it peaked at 4.7 million. Since 1991, Croatia's death rate has continuously exceeded its birth rate; the natural growth rate of the population is negative. Croatia is in the <b>fourth</b> <b>or</b> <b>fifth</b> stage of the demographic transition. In terms of age structure, the population is dominated by the 15‑ to 64‑year‑old segment. The median age of the population is 41.4, and the gender ratio of the total population is 0.93 males per 1 female.|$|E
5|$|With a {{population}} of 4.29million in 2011, Croatia ranks 125th {{in the world by}} population. Its population density is 75.8 inhabitants per square kilometre. The overall life expectancy in Croatia at birth is 78 years. The total fertility rate of 1.50 children per mother is one of the lowest in the world. Since 1991, Croatia's death rate has nearly continuously exceeded its birth rate. The Croatian Bureau of Statistics forecast that the population may even shrink to 3.1million by 2051, depending on the actual birth rate and the level of net migration. The population of Croatia rose steadily from 2.1million in 1857 until 1991, when it peaked at 4.7million, with the exception of censuses taken in 1921 and 1948, i.e. following two world wars. The natural growth rate of the population is negative. Croatia started advancing from the first stage of the demographic transition in the late 18th and early 19th centuries (depending on where in Croatia is being discussed). Croatia is in the <b>fourth</b> <b>or</b> <b>fifth</b> stage of the demographic transition.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{of modern}} human {{habitation}} in Malaysia dates back 40,000years. In the Malay Peninsula, the first inhabitants {{are thought to}} be Negritos. Traders and settlers from India and China arrived as early as the first century AD, establishing trading ports and coastal towns {{in the second and third}} centuries. Their presence resulted in strong Indian and Chinese influences on the local cultures, and the people of the Malay Peninsula adopted the religions of Hinduism and Buddhism. Sanskrit inscriptions appear as early as the <b>fourth</b> <b>or</b> <b>fifth</b> century. The Kingdom of Langkasuka arose around the second century in the northern area of the Malay Peninsula, lasting until about the 15th century. Between the 7th and 13th centuries, much of the southern Malay Peninsula was part of the maritime Srivijayan empire. By the 13th and the 14th century, the Majapahit empire had successfully wrested control over most of the peninsula and the Malay Archipelago from Srivijaya. Islam began to spread among Malays in the 14th century. In the early 15th century, Parameswara, a runaway king of the former Kingdom of Singapura linked to the old Srivijayan court, founded the Malacca Sultanate. Melaka was an important commercial centre during this time, attracting trade from around the region.|$|E

5000|$|In music theory, tertian (tertianus, [...] "of or {{concerning}} thirds") describes any piece, chord, counterpoint etc. {{constructed from}} the intervals of (major and minor) thirds. An interval {{such as that}} between the notes A and C encompasses 3 semitone intervals (A-B-B-C) and is termed a minor third while one such as that between C and E encompasses 4 semitones (C-D-D-E-E) and is called a major third. Tertian harmony (also called tertiary harmony) principally uses chords based on thirds; the term is typically used to contrast with quartal and quintal harmony which uses chords based on <b>fourths</b> <b>or</b> <b>fifths.</b>|$|R
50|$|The dholak {{is mainly}} a folk instrument, lacking the exact tuning and playing {{techniques}} of the tabla or the pakhawaj. The drum is pitched, depending on size, with an interval of perhaps a perfect <b>fourth</b> <b>or</b> perfect <b>fifth</b> between the two heads.|$|R

5000|$|Through {{the use of}} {{parallelism}} cadential {{patterns are}} inevitable. O.O. Bateye clarifies [...] "The subdominant (plagal) cadence is (resulting from the frequent tendency toward parallelism in African music) the favored cadence and not the perfect cadence, which is the norm in classical western music...Cadential patterns are frequent in African music and invariably result {{as a consequence of}} melodic movement either by thirds, <b>fourths,</b> <b>or</b> <b>fifths</b> - that is as a consequence of what may be referred to as shadow harmony...A cadential descending minor third is frequently noted between the minor third step and the tonic (Reiser, 1982:122) in African music." [...] These cadential movements are made using the melody and the scale as the guiding factor.|$|R
