The DRS zone at Suzuka was in its traditional spot, on the start/finish straight between turn 18 and turn 1, with the <b>detection</b> <b>point</b> just before the Casio Triangle complex.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the wide}} slew range and lack of {{positive}} feedback, the response of all the open-loop level detectors described above will be relatively slow. External overall positive feedback may be applied, but (unlike internal positive feedback that may be applied within the latter stages of a purpose-designed comparator) this markedly affects {{the accuracy of the}} zero-crossing <b>detection</b> <b>point.</b> Using a general-purpose op-amp, for example, the frequency of Ei for the sine to square wave converter should probably be below 100Hz.|$|E

50|$|This {{is carried}} out by safety {{critical}} computers called 'evaluators' which are centrally located, with the <b>detection</b> <b>points</b> located at the required sites in the field. The <b>detection</b> <b>points</b> are either connected to the evaluator via dedicated copper cable or via a telecommunications transmission system. This allows the <b>detection</b> <b>points</b> to be located significant distances from the evaluator. This is useful when using centralised interlocking equipment but less so when signalling equipment is distributed at the lineside in equipment cabinets.|$|R

Feature <b>point</b> <b>detection</b> in free-hand strokes is a hard problem because the input has noise from digitization, from natural hand tremor, and from lack of perfect motor control during drawing.

2500|$|After {{experimenting with}} two Drag Reduction System (DRS) zones {{with a single}} {{activation}} point in 2011, the FIA decided that the 2012 race would use a single, shorter DRS zone. In 2011, the DRS zone was 650 metres from the l'Epingle hairpin to the final chicane, with a secondary zone placed along the main straight. For 2012, the <b>detection</b> <b>point</b> was once again placed after the l'Epingle hairpin, and the DRS zone was shortened to 600 metres, while the secondary zone along the pit straight was removed. The FIA explained that the DRS zone was shortened because overtaking was [...] "too easy" [...] in 2011.|$|E
2500|$|Separation by {{capillary}} electrophoresis {{can be detected}} by several detection devices. [...] The majority of commercial systems use UV or UV-Vis absorbance as their primary mode of detection. [...] In these systems, {{a section of the}} capillary itself is used as the detection cell. [...] The use of on-tube detection enables detection of separated analytes with no loss of resolution. [...] In general, capillaries used in {{capillary electrophoresis}} are coated with a polymer (frequently polyimide or Teflon) for increased flexibility. [...] The portion of the capillary used for UV detection, however, must be optically transparent. [...] For polyimide-coated capillaries, a segment of the coating is typically burned or scraped off to provide a bare window several millimeters long. [...] This bare section of capillary can break easily, and capillaries with transparent coatings are available to increase the stability of the cell window. [...] The path length of the detection cell in capillary electrophoresis (~ 50 micrometers) is far less than that of a traditional UV cell (~ 1 cm). [...] According to the Beer-Lambert law, the sensitivity of the detector is proportional to the path length of the cell. [...] To improve the sensitivity, the path length can be increased, though this results in a loss of resolution. [...] The capillary tube itself can be expanded at the <b>detection</b> <b>point,</b> creating a [...] "bubble cell" [...] with a longer path length or additional tubing can be added at the <b>detection</b> <b>point</b> as shown in figure 2. [...] Both of these methods, however, will decrease the resolution of the separation. [...] Post-column detection utilizing a sheath flow configuration has also been described.|$|E

The <b>detection</b> <b>point</b> {{for the first}} was located on the entry to turn 1, with the activation zone placed on {{the apex of the}} corner.

40|$|Horizon-T‚Äù is an {{innovative}} detector system located at Tien Shan high-altitude Science Station (TSHASS) at approximately 3340 meters above the sea level. It consists of eight <b>detection</b> <b>points</b> separated by the distance {{up to one}} kilometer that can measure time characteristics of the Extensive Air Showers (EAS) and record signal shapes with time resolution of ~ 10 ns. It was constructed to register EAS in the energy range above 1016 eV coming {{from a wide range}} of zenith angles (0 o - 85 o). The system includes both the plastic scintillator particle detectors as well as the Vavilov - Cerenkov radiation detectors subsystem to observe the Cerenkov light from the EAS in the atmosphere directly. The time resolution and signal shape analysis capabilities of the <b>detection</b> <b>points</b> are used to study EAS development in the atmosphere. The development of the EAS is a process that can be studied both spatially and temporally. For the spatial part, a distributed network of <b>detection</b> <b>points</b> is required. For the time part, a signal shape must be recorded and analysed at each point with time resolution on the order of ~ 10 ns. In this paper, the current system description and performance level are described. Additionally, the latest data examples showing the unusual EAS examples above 1017 eV are included...|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} of outliers and change points from time series has become research {{focus in the}} area of time series data mining since it can be used for fraud detection, rare event discovery, event/trend change detection, etc. In most previous works, outlier <b>detection</b> and change <b>point</b> <b>detection</b> have not been related explicitly and the change <b>point</b> <b>detections</b> did not consider the influence of outliers, in this work, a unified detection framework was presented to deal with both of them. The framework is based on ALARCON-AQUINO and BARRIA&# 39;s change <b>points</b> <b>detection</b> method and adopts two-stage detection to divide the outliers and change points. The advantages of it lie in that: firstly, unified structure for change detection and outlier detection further reduces the computational complexity and make the detective procedure simple; Secondly, the detection strategy of outlier <b>detection</b> before change <b>point</b> <b>detection</b> avoids the influence of outliers to the change <b>point</b> <b>detection,</b> and thus improves the accuracy of the change <b>point</b> <b>detection.</b> The simulation experiments of the proposed method for both model data and actual application data have been made and gotten 100 % detection accuracy. The comparisons between traditional detection method and the proposed method further demonstrate that the unified detection structure is more accurate when the time series are contaminated by outliers...|$|R

40|$|The {{combination}} of optical detection techniques like photometry (UV) or laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) with mass spectrometry for capillary electrophoresis offers advantages, both {{for later use}} of stand-alone CE-UV or CE-LIF systems and for combined CE-UV-MS or CE-LIF-MS analysis. Faster method development is enabled, the identification of analytes is facilitated, and it allows christian the optical detection scheme {{to be used for}} more precise quantification. However, shortcomings of current methodology and equipment hindered the broader use of such detection combinations mainly due to the long distance between the <b>detection</b> <b>points</b> (at least 20 cm). Large shifts in migration times and changes in resolution are visible between the detection traces hindering their straightforward comparison. We present here novel equipment for a robust coupling of CE-LIF-MS with the shortest possible distance between <b>detection</b> <b>points</b> (12 cm) determined by the length of the electrospray needle. In addition, we encourage the use of a normalization of detection traces using a scale of effective electrophoretic mobility to obtain the same x-scale for both detection traces.
