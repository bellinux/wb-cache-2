By contrast, NY Rocks Jeanne Fury noted the track's upbeat, quirky energy. In the Japanese release's liner notes, critic Mia Clarke described the slow ballad [...] "Off You" [...] as having a lackadaisical feel; Pitchfork Medias Will Bryant {{was struck by the}} song's creepy quality, and compared it to the mood of the Pink Floyd album The Wall. Rolling Stones Arion Berger said [...] "Off You" [...] is [...] "as direct and heartbreaking as an eighty-five-year-old blues recording, and Kim, her voice clear and <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>hope,</b> can't help sounding like a young woman who's lived ten awful lifetimes." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Zack Handlen gave [...] "Family" [...] {{a rating}} of A for The A.V. Club. He said it was [...] "one of the best hours TNG has ever done", saying that the Picard scenes were the highlights. He called the scenes where Picard confesses his {{feelings}} about the Borg to Robert his favourite of [...] "all Stewart's amazing acting moments on the show so far". He summed up [...] "Family", saying [...] "It's also a remarkable episode, thoughtful, a little sad, {{but in the end}} <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>hope.</b> The final shot shows Picard's nephew dreaming under the stars. Like much of this episode, it could've been corny. And like all of this episode, it isn't." [...] "Family" [...] was included in a top ten list of the non-typical best episodes of the series by Carol Pinchefsky for Forbes; she called the scene where Picard admits his feelings towards the Borg as the highlight of the episode.|$|E

Jeff Tamarkin of AllMusic described Swift as [...] "a fresh, still girlish voice, <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>hope</b> and naïveté, but it's also a confident and mature one". He said her [...] "talent to be reckoned" [...] was portrayed through the songs [...] "Tim McGraw", [...] "The Outside", and [...] "Mary's Song (Oh My My My)". Tamarkin criticized producer Nathan Chapman for applying [...] "a gloss {{that not all}} [...] really require {{and in some cases}} would do better to shed". Rick Bell of Country Standard Time gave a positive review, saying that Swift had [...] "smart songwriting" [...] and that [...] "her deeply personal, self-penned songs, particularly 'The Outside' and 'Our Song'" [...] were [...] "stirring." [...] He compared her sound to Cyndi Thomson and Hilary Duff. Chris Neal of Country Weekly said that Swift [...] "demonstrat an honesty, intelligence and idealism with which listeners of any age will be able to connect" [...] and added that [...] "the more thoughtful material suggests a talent poised to last well past high school." [...] Ken Rosenbaum of The Toledo Blade wrote Swift [...] "deftly handles lyrics and subjects in that shadowy area between teenager and womanhood." ...|$|E

2500|$|Let me {{take you}} back to the winter of 1938: then as a young man, <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>hope</b> and {{ambition}} to play cricket for my county, I travelled from my place of work in the City of London to a sports complex at Leytonstone where Jack O'Connor and Stan Nichols looked after the cricketing side of the organisation. Arranging to practice in the nets three evenings a week, under the direction ot these two fine Essex and England cricketers, seemed to be an excellent way in which to get noticed and known in Essex cricketing circles, especially as previously I had been playing my cricket outside the county. It was, in effect, a planned exercise, designed to make things happen, which continued right through to the spring of 1939 when I was finally invited to a trial at Woodford Wells. The planned exercise worked! ...|$|E

It’s very disappointing, I was <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>hope</b> coming here, but I am certain {{it is not a}} meteorite.” Dr Vilks pointed out that there was green grass inside the artificial crater, with only a small area at the bottom burnt, and no ejected material or meteorite fragments were found on surrounding land. He described the supposed meteorite as [...] "a ball of clay that was burning", and said that samples had been taken for university geologists to examine. He noted [...] "There was a small blast heard by local people but this was not strong enough to create the crater". Nature conservationist Dainis Ozols also examined the scene and said he believed that someone had burned a pyrotechnic compound {{at the bottom of a}} man-made hole to create the illusion of a meteorite crater. Police warned of a possible criminal investigation into the hoax.|$|E
2500|$|Fechner's world {{concept was}} highly animistic. He felt {{the thrill of}} life everywhere, in plants, earth, stars, the total universe. Man stands midway between the souls of plants and the souls of stars, who are angels. God, {{the soul of the}} universe, must be {{conceived}} as having an existence analogous to men. Natural laws are just the modes of the unfolding of God's perfection. In his last work Fechner, aged but <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>hope,</b> contrasts this joyous [...] "daylight view" [...] of the world with the dead, dreary [...] "night view" [...] of materialism. Fechner's work in aesthetics is also important. He conducted experiments to show that certain abstract forms and proportions are naturally pleasing to our senses, and gave some new illustrations of the working of aesthetic association. Charles Hartshorne saw him as a predecessor on his and Alfred North Whitehead's philosophy and regretted that Fechner's philosophical work had been neglected for so long.|$|E

2500|$|The plot of Némirovsky's third novel {{exists as}} a plot outline, with some contradictions, in her notebook. Benoît has [...] "friends" [...] (the nascent Communist resistance) in Paris.

In Paris, Benoît and Jean-Marie Michaud are denounced, arrested and in prison, meet Hubert. Jean-Marie is pardoned by the Germans, when Lucile contacts Bruno von Falk on his behalf. Benoît and his friends organize an escape and release Jean-Marie and Hubert. Jean-Marie and Lucile meet and fall in love but after learning that she is {{still in love with}} Bruno, he leaves to fight against the Germans and dies heroically. On the Eastern Front, Bruno is also killed, Lucile losing her French and German beloveds. In a sub-plot, the writer Gabriel Corte, a relatively minor and unsympathetic character in Tempête en juin, emerges as a propagandist and politician, initially collaborating with the Germans, later perhaps disaffected; Benoît dies brutally and <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>hope.</b>|$|E
