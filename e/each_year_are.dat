5|$|Although {{the numbers}} of dogs killed <b>each</b> <b>year</b> <b>are</b> {{relatively}} low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs. In many cultures, there are strong social and emotional bonds between humans and their dogs {{that can be seen}} as family members or working team members. The loss of a dog can lead to strong emotional responses with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.|$|E
5|$|Regarding incidence, cohort {{longitudinal}} studies (studies where a disease-free population is followed over the years) provide rates between 10 and 15 per thousand person–years for all dementias and 5–8 for AD, {{which means that}} half of new dementia cases <b>each</b> <b>year</b> <b>are</b> AD. Advancing age is a primary risk factor for the disease and incidence rates are not equal for all ages: every {{five years after the}} age of 65, the risk of acquiring the disease approximately doubles, increasing from 3 to as much as 69 per thousand person years. There are also sex differences in the incidence rates, women having a higher risk of developing AD particularly in the population older than 85. The risk of dying from Alzheimer's disease is 26% higher among the non-Hispanic white population than among the non-Hispanic black population, whereas the Hispanic population has a 30% lower risk than the non-Hispanic white population.|$|E
5|$|Students must {{audition}} for admission; fewer than 20percent {{of those who}} apply <b>each</b> <b>year</b> <b>are</b> accepted. SCPA is free to CPS students but also attracts tuition-paying students from outside the district and the state. The newly combined school will serve approximately 1,300 students in 2010, offering a curriculum designed {{to prepare students for}} professional careers in creative writing, dance, drama, music, technical theater, and visual art. The emphasis is on performance, and students in every field are required to perform or present their work in public regularly. Students compete successfully in arts competitions locally and internationally. On standardized tests, SCPA ranks second among Cincinnati public schools. Ninety percent of graduating seniors continue on to college, and those students receive one of the highest levels of scholarship funding in the city. A limited number of extracurricular activities are offered, as students are expected to commit significant after-school time to training and performance. SCPA has produced notable graduates {{in a wide range of}} artistic fields, including award-winning actors, singers, directors and technicians.|$|E

25|$|Worldwide {{slavery is}} a {{criminal}} offense but slave owners can get very high returns for their risk.

The weighted average annual profits generated by a slave in 2007 was $3,175, with a low of an average $950 for bonded labour and $29,210 for a trafficked sex slave.

25|$|Roughly 20 million {{dogs are}} killed for {{consumption}} each year, making the People's Republic of China the world's largest consumer of dog meat.

Selling dog meat as food {{is against the}} Food Safety Law of the People's Republic of China. According to the Animal Epidemic Prevention Law of the People’s Republic of China (2013 Amendment), dogs need to be vaccinated. Dogs for eating are not vaccinated, so they are illegal to transport or to sell; however, despite this, approximately 10 million dogs <b>each</b> <b>year</b> <b>are</b> slaughtered for consumption.|$|E

25|$|The suicide {{incidence}} rate in India, on 100,000 farmers basis, is unclear. All estimates are speculative, because actual {{total number of}} farmers by state or India in <b>each</b> <b>year</b> <b>are</b> not available. Farm suicides per 100,000 farmers can be reliably calculated for 2001, because accurate data on number of farmers {{in the country and}} states is available for 2001 from the Census of India. The farm suicide rate was 12.9 suicides per 100,000 farmers, which was higher than the general suicide rate at 10.6 for 2001 in India. By gender, the suicide rate was 16.2 male farmer suicides per 100,000 male farmers compared to 12.5 male suicides per 100,000 for general population. Among women, the suicide rate was 6.2 female farmer suicides per 100,000 female farmers compared to 8.5 female suicides per 100,000 for general population.|$|E
