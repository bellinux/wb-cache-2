500|$|Edwards {{signed for}} League One side Stevenage on 27 June 2011. He joined the club on a free transfer, rejecting a {{contract}} extension at Accrington. He signed a one-year deal with Stevenage, with the option of a second year. On joining the club he said [...] "I wasn't particularly looking for another club and I didn't {{have any interest in}} any other clubs at the time, so I thought I'd still be at Accrington next season. However, the manager got in touch with my agent and discussed the offer and when I thought <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> of playing League One football I decided to sign for Stevenage". Edwards was assigned the number six shirt ahead of the 2011–12 season. He made his Stevenage debut {{on the first day of}} the 2011–12 season, playing the whole match in a 0–0 home draw against Exeter City. Edwards made 13 starting appearances for the club, as well as a further 14 appearances from the substitute's bench, during the first half of the club's first ever League One campaign.|$|E
2500|$|Shamrock {{engaged in}} a feud with Don Frye during {{his career in the}} Pride Fighting Championships, whose {{background}} was Don Frye's trash talking. In 1999, Alicia Webb (also known as Ryan Shamrock) dated Ken Shamrock until early 2003. Frye made comments to the effect that Shamrock cheated on and divorced his wife to date a young girl (Alicia Webb was 19 and Ken Shamrock was 35 when they started dating). Frye also joked that Ken's (at the time) estranged father Bob and brother Frank would be in Frye's corner for the fight. Ken Shamrock was enraged by Frye's trash talk, causing a feud between Shamrock and Frye. Since then, Frye has stated that he only resorted to personal trash talk to make Ken want to fight him. Frye said: [...] "I saw Ken Shamrock whoop him (Dan Severn) at UFC 6 and I thought, [...] "That's a guy I gotta fight. Anybody who can whoop Dan Severn like that has gotta be a man and I want to test my size against his size. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> to talk trash and they gave me the fight; I crossed the line. I wasn't professional about it, but Ken was and after the fight, we shook hands and went our separate ways." ...|$|E

50|$|I {{like that}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> {{to be in}} someone else’s shoes. Once I portray someone else’s life, I get to {{understand}} who that person is. It gives me a much bigger and better perspective on everyone’s lives around me.|$|R

6000|$|... "I daresay," [...] said Peter resignedly; [...] "all {{the more}} reason why I should speak to you while <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance.</b> No, you shan't go till you have heard me.

60|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. Well, if even <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance,</b> I wouldn’t. On the contrary, I {{am going}} to render him a great service.|$|E
60|$|I was silent, but I did {{not accept}} the explanation. And so, when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance,</b> I asked old man Sellers, who browsed daily on my exchanges.|$|E
6000|$|And [...] "Damn it!" [...] he cried, [...] "if {{these dreams}} are for Chatteris, {{why should she}} tell me? Suppose <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> of them-- Whatever they are----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am more {{accustomed}} to keepin' my eyes open durin' a long time than are you; but if it so be <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance,</b> you may be certain I shall take advantage of it. Now, remember, eat an' sleep until I seek you out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank ye kindly. 'Twill {{be a real}} treat. <b>I</b> mostly <b>has</b> to eat my meals alone, {{with the}} {{reflection}} of my ugly old phiz in a looking glass opposite for company. 'Tisn't often <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> {{to sit down with}} two such sweet purty ladies." ...|$|R
6000|$|But when Tommy had {{got back}} his wind he said nobly: [...] "I'll call her no names. If {{this is how}} she likes to repay me for--for all my kindnesses, let her. But, Elspeth, if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance,</b> <b>I</b> shall go on being good to her just the same." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Decker {{shook his}} head sorrowfully. [...] "No, Elsie, not mine. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> to do it once, and I let it go. It's done now--but not by me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} you suffered, but I am glad <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> to meet you," [...] {{answered}} Dave. [...] "It may mean {{a great deal}} to me, you know." ...|$|E
60|$|Power? Oh, I haven't that. But {{it makes}} me so proud to think I can be of any use at all. I only wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> to do more. Since I've been here I've grown very patriotic.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir-ee! Mr. Fernald {{has begun}} to give me lessons in the gymnasium, an' I'm to {{practise}} there two hours every day from this out--that is, so long as I do it an' keep my reg'lar work up in shape, which, 'cordin' to my way of thinkin', will be every minute <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> of stayin' there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{murder of}} Miss Carne," [...] George Forester repeated, slowly. [...] "I {{know nothing about}} that. She made Ruth break it off with me, and I nearly killed Ruth, and would have killed her if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance,</b> but <b>I</b> never <b>had.</b> <b>I</b> was glad when I heard she was killed, but I don't know who did it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady Barbara, I {{am afraid}} {{this is the}} last time we shall be alone together. While <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance,</b> therefore, <b>I</b> must do homage....

6000|$|... "We'll square up, don't you worry," [...] {{answered}} Dan Baxter. [...] "I'm not forgetting all they've done {{against me}} in the past. If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> I'd wring the neck of every one of them," [...] he added, fiercely.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing venture nothing have! Besides, {{you make}} sure that he's honourable before you begin. You'd be safe enough with yours. I wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance!</b> Lots of girls do it; {{or do you think}} they'd get married at all?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd {{take him}} if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance,</b> just because {{everybody}} wants him. Don't admire him a particle, {{but it will}} make a jolly stir whenever he does marry, and I wouldn't mind having a hand in it," [...] said the second budding belle.|$|E

40|$|I wish {{to thank}} the {{philosophy}} department at the University of Turku, which has provided me a friendly and stimulating working environment.

6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] thought he, [...] "I {{was foolish}} not to shoot them when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance.</b> They are {{too far away}} now, and it looks very much as if that red rascal will get one of them. I believe I'll spoil that red scamp's plans by {{frightening}} them away. I don't believe that Deer will be back here to-day anyway, so I may as well save those Ducks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I love Paris," [...] sighed Miss Wilkinson. [...] "But I {{had to go}} to Berlin. I {{was with}} the Foyots till the girls married, and then I could get nothing to do, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> of this post in Berlin.

6000|$|... 'And {{would not}} I {{be proud to}} be killed for your sake?

6000|$|... "Excuse me," [...] she said, [...] "but I {{must speak}} while <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance.</b> You must believe what {{my husband has}} said to you.

6000|$|I hit {{him back}} again. [...] "In that case, sir, a little Socialism in England would do you no harm.

60|$|Mr. Cooke at once began a tirade {{against the}} {{residents}} of Asquith for permitting a sandy and generally disgraceful condition of the roads. So roundly did he vituperate the inn management in particular, and with such a loud flow of words, that I trembled lest he should be heard on the veranda. The Celebrity stood by the block, in an amazement which gave me a wicked pleasure, and it was some minutes before <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> to introduce him.|$|E
