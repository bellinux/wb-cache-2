25|$|Quazepam (marketed under {{brand names}} Doral, Dormalin) is a {{relatively}} long-acting benzodiazepine derivative drug developed by the Schering Corporation in the 1970s. Quazepam is indicated {{for the treatment of}} insomnia including sleep induction and sleep maintenance. Quazepam induces impairment of motor function and has relatively (and uniquely) selective hypnotic and anticonvulsant properties with considerably less overdose potential than other benzodiazepines (due to its novel receptor-subtype selectively). Quazepam is an effective hypnotic which induces and maintains sleep without disruption of the sleep architecture. Quazepam is a trifluoroalkyl type of benzodiazepine, like fletazepam, <b>halazepam,</b> triflubazam and triflunordazepam. Quazepam is unique amongst benzodiazepines in that it selectively targets the GABAA α1 subunit receptors which are responsible for inducing sleep. Its mechanism of action is very similar to zolpidem and zaleplon in its pharmacology and can successfully substitute for zolpidem and zaleplon in animal studies.|$|E

A 1991 study indicated that diazepam, in particular, had a greater abuse liability among people who were drug abusers than did many of the other benzodiazepines. Some of the available data also suggested that lorazepam and alprazolam are more diazepam-like in having relatively high abuse liability, while oxazepam, <b>halazepam,</b> and possibly chlordiazepoxide, are relatively low in this regard. A 1991–1993 British study found that the hypnotics flurazepam and temazepam were more toxic than average benzodiazepines in overdose. A 1995 study found that temazepam is more rapidly absorbed and oxazepam is more slowly absorbed than most other benzodiazepines.|$|E

40|$|The {{anticonvulsant}} {{properties of}} several 1, 4 -benzodiazepine and azirino[1, 2 -d][1, 4]benzodiazepine (ABDZ) derivatives were studied after intraperitoneal (IP) administration in DBA/ 2 mice (a strain genetically susceptible to sound-induced seizures) and in Swiss mice. The anticonvulsant effects were evaluated on seizures evoked {{by means of}} auditory stimulation (109 dB, 12 - 16 kHz) in animals placed singly under a hemispheric Perspex dome or on seizures induced by administration of pentylenetetrazole. The 1, 4 -benzodiazepines were generally more potent than the related ABDZ derivatives. The rank order of potency for anticonvulsant activity was flunitrazepam > diazepam > pinazepam > ABDZ 5 > ABDZ 4 > prazepam > <b>halazepam</b> > ABDZ 1 > ABDZ 3 > camazepam > ABDZ 6 > ABDZ 2. The impairment of locomotor performance following IP administration of these derivatives was also evaluated {{by means of the}} rotarod test. The rank order of potency for impairment of coordinated motor movements was pinazepam > flunitrazepam > diazepam > ABDZ 5 > prazepam > <b>halazepam</b> > ABDZ 4 > ABDZ 3 > ABDZ 1 > camazepam > ABDZ 2 = ABDZ 6. The potency of various 1, 4 -benzodiazepines and ABDZs as inhibitors of specific [3 H]flumazenil binding to membranes from cerebellum or cortex was evaluated. In general, ABDZs were active as anticonvulsants and inhibited [3 H]flumazenil binding in the micromolar range. Radioligand binding studies carried out in stable cell lines demonstrated that none of the ABDZs tested showed a particular subtype specificity. The pharmacological actions of ABDZ 4 and ABDZ 5, which appeared to be the most potent ABDZs as anticonvulsants, were significantly reduced by treatment with flumazenil (8. 24 mumol/kg IP), suggesting a clear involvement of benzodiazepine mechanisms in the anticonvulsant activity of these compounds or their metabolites. The anticonvulsant activity of ABDZ 4 and ABDZ 5 was also evaluated against seizures induced in DBA/ 2 mice by two beta-carbolines: methyl-beta-carboline- 3 -carboxylate (beta-CCM) and methyl- 6, 6 -dimethoxy- 4 -ethyl-beta-carboline- 3 -carboxylate (DMCM). Both ABDZ 4 and ABDZ 5 give better protection against seizures induced by beta-CCM than DMCM, suggesting a preferential action on the benzodiazepine receptor subtype BDZ 1...|$|E
40|$|Phenobarbitone-pretreated male Sprague-Dawley rat liver microsomes {{were used}} to examine C-hydroxylation and N-dealkylation of four {{clinically}} important benzodiazepines: diazepam (DZP), prazepam (PZP), pinazepam (PIN) and <b>halazepam</b> (HZP). These substrates differ only {{in the nature of}} the N-substituent of the B ring and N-desmethyldiazepam (DMD) is the N-dealkylation product in each case. C-Hydroxylation was accordingly also studied with DMD as substrate. All monooxygenations were studied with substrates at a concentration of 10 μM, in the absence of solubilizing agents, and under conditions where the production of secondary metabolites was minimized. A 20 -fold variation in the rate of C-hydroxylation was recorded across the five substrates with HZP showing the highest rate and DMD showing the lowest rate. An almost equally large range of variation was shown for the N-dealkylation reaction, with PZP undergoing this biotransformation more than 17 times faster than DZP. Log P values (a measure of lipophilicity) for the five substrates were determined using an HPLC method and a remarkable lack of correspondence between this substrate parameter and either of the monooxygenations was noted. This suggests that multiple substrate determinants govern the relative rates of these monooxygenations. It was, however, notable that the additive rate of metabolism of these substrates by both monooxygenase routes did show an excellent correlation with substrate lipophilicity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract] Experimental Because of the {{increase}} in use of the newer benzodiazepines, we explored the opportunity to develop a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) method that encompasses most of the widely prescribed benzodiazepines in use today. The benzodiazepines included in our study are nordiazepam, oxazepam, temazepam, Iorazepam, o~-hydroxyalprazolam, 0 c-hydroxytriazolam, desalkylflurazepam, and 2 -hydroxyethylflurazepam. Using t. 0 mL of urine as the matrix, we added the enzyme Glusulase and incubated the specimens for 2 h to obtain the free drugs. The hydrolyzed samples were then loaded onto a Toxi-Lab Spec VC MP 3 column containing a 15 -rag disc. On-disc derivatization was accomplished by adding N-methyI-N-(t-bulyldimethylsilyl) trifluroacetamide (MTBSTFA) with 1 % TBDMSCI to the disc. The derivatives were then placed in a GC vial and analyzed by GC-MS in the selected ion moniloring mode. These results were then compared to confirmed positives by the traditional acid hydrolysis GC-MS method. We identified 20 specimens that were screened positive by Roche Diagnostic benzodiazepines assay from one of our rou-tine screening runs (3). These 20 specimens were first pro-cessed by our standard gas chromatographic-mass spectro-metric (GC-MS) confirmation method, which is acid hydrolysis. Because this method creates amino-benzophe-nones from the more traditional benzodiazepines (e. g., nor-diazepam, oxazepam, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, clorazepate, <b>halazepam,</b> and prazepam), identification of the prescribed drug is impossible (4, 5). Because of the lack of correlation between the screening method and the acid hydrolysis confir-mation method, we explored the possibility of using an enzyme hydrolysis method on the same 20 specimens using the intact benzodiazepine molecule (6).

40|$|Editorial Group: Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group. Published Online: 18 JAN 2012. Assessed as up-to-date: 6 SEP 2011 BACKGROUND Pain {{management}} {{is a high}} priority for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Muscle relaxants include drugs that reduce muscle spasm (for example benzodiazepines such as diazepam (Valium), alprazolam (Xanax), lorazepam (Ativan) and non-benzodiazepines such as metaxalone (Skelaxin) or a combination of paracetamol and orphenadrine (Muscol)) and drugs that prevent increased muscle tone (baclofen and dantrolene). Despite a paucity of evidence supporting their use, antispasmodic and antispasticity muscle relaxants have gained widespread clinical acceptance as adjuvants in the management of patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. OBJECTIVES The aim of this review was to determine the efficacy and safety of muscle relaxants in pain management in patients with RA. The muscle relaxants that were included in this review are the antispasmodic benzodiazepines (alprazolam, bromazepam, chlordiazepoxide,cinolazepam, clonazepam, cloxazolam, clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam, flunitrazepam, flurazepam, flutoprazepam, <b>halazepam,</b> ketazolam, loprazolam, lorazepam, lormetazepam, medazepam, midazolam, nimetazepam, nitrazepam, nordazepam, oxazepam, pinazepam, prazepam, quazepam, temazepam, tetrazepam, triazolam), antispasmodic non-benzodiazepines (cyclobenzaprine, carisoprodol, chlorzoxazone, meprobamate, methocarbamol, metaxalone, orphenadrine, tizanidine and zopiclone), and antispasticity drugs (baclofen and dantrolene sodium). SEARCH METHODS We performed a search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 4 th quarter 2010), MEDLINE (1950 to week 1 November 2010), EMBASE (Week 44 2010), and PsycINFO (1806 to week 2 November 2010). We also searched the 2008 to 2009 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) abstracts and performed a handsearch of reference lists of relevant articles. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials which compared a muscle relaxant to another therapy (active, including non-pharmacological therapies, or placebo) in adult patients with RA and that reported at least one clinically relevant outcome. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two blinded review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the trials. Meta-analyses were used to examine the efficacy of muscle relaxants on pain, depression, sleep and function, as well as their safety. MAIN RESULTS Six trials (126 participants) were included in this review. All trials were rated at high risk of bias. Five cross-over trials evaluated a benzodiazepine, four assessed diazepam (n = 71) and one assessed triazolam (n = 15). The sixth trial assessed zopiclone (a non-benzodiazepine) (n = 40) and was a parallel group study. No trial duration was longer than two weeks while three single dose trials assessed outcomes at 24 hours only. Overall the included trials failed to find evidence of a beneficial effect of muscle relaxants over placebo, alone (at 24 hrs, 1 or 2 weeks) or in addition to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (at 24 hrs), on pain intensity, function, or quality of life. Data from two trials of longer than 24 hours duration (n = 74) (diazepam and zopiclone) found that participants who received a muscle relaxant had significantly more adverse events compared with those who received placebo (number needed to harm (NNTH) 3, 95 % CI 2 to 7). These were predominantly central nervous system side effects, including dizziness and drowsiness (NNTH 3, 95 % CI 2 to 11). AUTHORS’ CONCLUSIONS Based upon the currently available evidence in patients with RA, benzodiazepines (diazepam and triazolam) {{do not appear to be}} beneficial in improving pain over 24 hours or one week. The non-benzodiazepine agent zopiclone also did not significantly reduce pain over two weeks. However, even short term muscle relaxant use (24 hours to 2 weeks) is associated with significant adverse events, predominantly drowsiness and dizziness.
