The experimental procedure has been used to test radiation hardness of commercial semiconductor memories. Different types of memory chips have been exposed to <b>indirect</b> <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> by changing radiation dose intensity. The effect of direct ionizing radiation on semiconductor memory behavior has been analyzed by using Monte Carlo simulation method. Obtained results show that gamma radiation causes decrease in threshold voltage, being proportional to the absorbed dose of radiation.

We have examined the reactivity of guanyl radicals in plasmid DNA with the six most easily oxidized amino acids cysteine, cystine, histidine, methionine, tryptophan and tyrosine and also simple ester and amide derivatives of them. Cystine and histidine derivatives are unreactive. Cysteine, methionine, tyrosine and particularly tryptophan derivatives react to repair guanyl radicals in plasmid DNA with rate constants in the region of ∼ 105, 105, 106 and 107 dm 3 mol– 1 s– 1, respectively. The implication is that amino acid residues in DNA binding proteins such as histones might be able to repair by an electron transfer reaction the DNA damage produced by the direct effect of <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> or by other oxidative insults...|$|R

The introductory theoretical part is devoted to the basic information about <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation.</b> What are the types of <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation,</b> its characteristics, properties and sources of <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation.</b> Furthermore, there are mentioned direct and <b>indirect</b> interactions of <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation,</b> a brief description of charged particle accelerators, collimator systems and radioisotope irradiation devices. Another part deals with radiation protection, basic legislation, methods and principles of radiation protection, personal dosimetry and medical supervision of radiation workers. Literary sources, available internet links and valid legal regulations were used for the work. In the practical part, a number of measurements were carried out to measure and to analyse the doses of secondary radiation of the linear accelerator collimator system for different photon beam energies, depending on time, distance from source, position of radiologic assistant around the table when working with the patient, as well as sizes of irradiated field. The aim of the work was to find out how large the doses of secondary radiation are, although measurable, but their values are not sufficient to be detected by personal dosimeters of radiological assistants. Confirm the hypothesis that the doses from the secondary radiation of the linear accelerator collimator system are so low that the dose power does not exceed 0. 031 mGy/hr. The results obtained from various measurements are processed into transparent tables and graphically displayed. Based on the results of the measurements, the hypotheses were confirmed...|$|R
40|$|The code RITRACKS (Relativistic Ion Tracks) {{has been}} {{developed}} {{over the last few}} years at the NASA Johnson Space Center to simulate the effects of <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiations</b> at the microscopic scale, to understand the effects of space radiation at the biological level. The fundamental part of this code is the stochastic simulation of radiation track structure of heavy ions, an important component of space radiations. The code can calculate many relevant quantities such as the radial dose, voxel dose, and may also be used to calculate the dose in spherical and cylindrical targets of various sizes. Recently, we have incorporated DNA structure and damage simulations at the molecular scale in RITRACKS. The direct effect of radiations is simulated by introducing a slight modification of the existing particle transport algorithms, using the BinaryEncounterBethe model of ionization cross sections for each molecular orbitals of DNA. The simulation of radiation chemistry is done by a stepbystep diffusionreaction program based on the Green's functions of the diffusion equation]. This approach is also used to simulate the <b>indirect</b> effect of <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> on DNA. The software can be installed independently on PC and tablets using the Windows operating system and does not require any coding from the user.

40|$|The {{insemination}} of mammalian spermatozoa {{which have}} been treated in vitro with X-rays at a dose level of 400 to 800 r results in failure {{of a large number}} of eggs to develop beyond the blastocyst stage in rabbits (Amoroso & Parkes, 1947; Chang, Hunt & Romanoff, 1957); mice (Edwards, 1957) and cattle (Rowson & Dott, 1964). Higher doses of X-rays caused development of the eggs to fail at earlier stages (Amoroso & Parkes, 1947; Chang et al., 1957; Edwards, 1957). Yet the metabolism and motility of irradiated spermatozoa appear to be unaffected even by much higher doses of X-rays, at least in those species {{which have been}} examined (cf. Mann, 1964). It seems likely that it is the deoxyribo-nucleic acid (dna) in the spermatozoa which is affected by X-irradiation rather than their metabolism, motility or fertilizing capacity. X-rays can, presumably, act on dna either directly by virtue of their ionizing activity on dna molecules, or indirectly by producing free radicles.

40|$|International audienceThe most {{aggressive}} product of water radiolysis, the hydroxyl (OH(center dot)) radical, {{is responsible for}} the <b>indirect</b> effect of <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiations</b> on DNA in solution and aerobic conditions. According to radiolytic footprinting experiments, the resulting strand breaks and base modifications are inhomogeneously distributed along the DNA molecule irradiated free or bound to ligands (polyamines, thiols, proteins). A Monte-Carlo based model of simulation of the reaction of OH(center dot) radicals with the macromolecules, called RADACK, allows calculating the relative probability of damage of each nucleotide of DNA irradiated alone or in complexes with proteins. RADACK calculations require the knowledge of the three dimensional structure of DNA and its complexes (determined by X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy or molecular modeling). The confrontation of the calculated values with the results of the radiolytic footprinting experiments together with molecular modeling calculations show that: (1) the extent and location of the lesions are strongly dependent on the structure of DNA, which in turns is modulated by the base sequence and by the binding of proteins and (2) the regions in contact with the protein can be protected against the attack by the hydroxyl radicals via masking of the binding site and by scavenging of the radicals...|$|R

40|$|When DNA is {{irradiated}} in aqueous solution, most of {{the damage}} is inflicted by water-derived radicals. This is called the <b>indirect</b> effect of <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation.</b> However in whole cells not only the primary formed water radicals play a role, because some cellular compounds form secondary radicals which can also damage DNA. It is known that the amino acid phenylalanine is able to react with water radicals, resulting {{in the production of}} secondary phenylalanine radicals which can damage and inactivate DNA. In a previous study the influence of the presence of phenylalanine during gamma-irradiation of DNA in aqueous solution under oxic conditions was studied. Under anoxic irradiation conditions different amounts and types of reactive water-derived radicals are formed compared to oxic conditions and also different phenylalanine radicals are formed. Therefore, this study examines the influence of the presence of phenylalanine under anoxic conditions on the gamma-radiation-induced mutation spectrum. The results indicate that phenylalanine radicals are damaging to DNA, but less effective compared to primary water radicals. On the mutational level, in the presence of phenylalanine radicals under anoxic conditions, the amount of mutations on G:C base pairs was significantly decreased as compared to oxic conditions. Furthermore, {{the results of this study}} indicate that nucleotide excision repair is involved in repair of both inactivating and mutagenic damage induced by phenylalanine radicals under anoxic conditions...|$|R
40|$|Transfer of {{the gene}} {{encoding}} the noradrenaline transporter (NAT) into tumor cells rendered them amenable to dose dependent, [131 I]meta-iodobenzylguanidine ([131 I]MIBG) mediated cell kill. We have utilised the human telomerase component promoters (hTR and hTERT) to drive NAT gene expression specifically in tumor cells. Transfected cells were treated with benzylguanidine conjugated to the α-emitting radionuclide [211 At]-astatine - [211 At]MABG. This radiopharmaceutical was shown to be 1000 times more radiotoxic than the conventional β-emitter [131 I]MIBG. Moreover the high LET emissions from 211 At kill tumor cells regardless of cell cycle or oxygen status. The interactive components of this novel gene therapy strategy should provide a safe and potent form of radiation-mediated tumor cell kill. <b>Indirect</b> effects of <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> may contribute significantly {{to the effectiveness of}} radiotherapy by sterilizing malignant cells that are not directly hit by the radiation. However, there have been few investigations of the importance of indirect effects in targeted radionuclide treatment. We compared the induction of bystander effects by external beam γ-radiation with those resultant from exposure to three radiohaloanalogues of meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) : [131 I]MIBG (low linear energy transfer (LET) β-emitter), [123 I]MIBG (potentially high LET Auger electron emitter), and meta-[211 At]astatobenzylguanidine ([211 At]MABG) (high LET α-emitter). We observed that potent toxins were generated specifically by cells which concentrated radiohalogenated MIBG.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that treatment of mammalian cells with <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> is associated with activation of gene expression. Although the signal transduction pathways stimulated by <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> remain unclear, our previous findings indicate that radiation induces specific genes at the transcriptional level. The present work has examined the effects of <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> on the transcription factor NF-kappa B. The results demonstrate that <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> activates DNA binding of nuclear factor (NF) kappa B. This effect was detectable at 2 grays (Gy) and reached a maximum at 5 - 20 Gy. At a dose of 20 Gy, the increase in NF-kappa B binding activity was maximal at 2 - 4 h and then declined to pretreatment levels. The results also demonstrate that <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> transiently increases NF-kappa B mRNA levels. However, the finding that induction of NF-kappa B binding to DNA occurs in the presence of cycloheximide indicates that <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> activates preexisting NF-kappa B protein.

40|$|The p 53 {{protein is}} one of the major tumor {{suppressor}} proteins. In response to DNA damage, p 53 is prevented from degradation and accumulates to high levels. <b>Ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> leads to hypophosphorylation of the p 53 ubiquitin ligase Mdm 2 at sites where phosphorylation is critical for p 53 degradation and to the phosphorylation and activation of Akt/PKB, a kinase that phosphorylates and inhibits GSK- 3. GSK- 3, which normally phosphorylates Mdm 2, is inactivated in response to <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation.</b> We show that p 53 accumulates in lymphoblasts from patients with the hereditary disorder ataxia telangiectasia in response to <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> despite the absence of a functional ATM kinase. Also, knockdown of ATR did not prevent p 53 accumulation in response to <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation.</b> Instead, p 53 stabilization in response to <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> depended on the inactivation of GSK- 3 and the presence of Akt/PKB. Akt/PKB is a target of DNA-PK, a kinase that is activated after <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation.</b> Correspondingly, down-regulation of DNA-PK prevented phosphorylation of Akt/PKB and GSK- 3 after <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> and strongly reduced the accumulation of p 53.
