Jeliffe replied that he intended to charge murder, piracy, and running away with a vessel with intent to steal it. Vroom granted an adjournment until Tuesday at 11am. Jackalow was remanded to the city prison.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{his time}} as housing {{secretary}} was considered unsuccessful. However, although {{he could not get}} federal funding for empowerment zones passed during his tenure, by 1992 38 states had created empowerment zones, and in 1994 $3.5billion was approved for them under President Clinton. A free market Kemp initiative to allow homeowners to subdivide their houses for the purpose of creating rental units without inordinate bureaucracy did not get executed under the Clinton administration, however. In 1992, with <b>H.</b> <b>Ross</b> Perot mounting a formidable campaign, Kemp was again considered a Vice Presidential candidate.|$|E

After the first three ballots ended in ties, Ross called upon his supporters to vote for Wilson, who was then elected unanimously.|$|E

40|$|The {{taxonomy}} of immature and mature Trichoptera of the North Saskatchewan, South Saskatchewan, and Saskatchewan Rivers in Saskatchewan was studied from 1971 - 1973. Pupae were reared to the adult stage and larvae {{were associated with}} adults. Keys {{were made to the}} specific level for species collected. Thirty-eight species in eight families and seventeen genera were collected. The thirty-eight species collected include Protoptila cantha Ross, P. tenebrosa (Walker), Neureclipsis bimaculatus (Linnaeus), N. crepuscularis (Walker), Psychomyia flavida Hagen, Hydropsyche bifida Banks, <b>H.</b> bronta <b>Ross,</b> <b>H.</b> recurvata Banks, <b>H.</b> placoda <b>Ross,</b> <b>H.</b> occidentalis Banks, H. guttata Pictet, Cheumatopsyche speciosa (Banks), f. lasia Ross, C. campyla Ross, Agraylea multipunctata Curtis, Hydroptila spatulata Morton, <b>H.</b> ajax <b>Ross,</b> <b>H.</b> comsimilis Morton, <b>H.</b> angusta <b>Ross,</b> Neotrichiahalia Denning, N. ersitis Denning, Mayatrichia ayama Mosely, Phryganeacinerea Walker, Onocosmoecus unicolor (Banks), Anabolia bimaculata (Walker), Asynarchus curtus (Banks), Arthripsodes tarsi-punctatus (Vorhies), A. arielles Denning, A. annulicornis (Stephens), A. sp. 1, Oecetis avara (Banks), Q. inconspicua (Walker), Q. sp. 1, Triaenodes frontalis Banks, Nectopsyche diarina (Ross), N. intervena (Banks), H. exguisita (Walker), and Brachycentrus occidentalis Banks. Mature larvae and pupae of most families were separable to species but immature larvae were usually not separated by keys presented in this study. Hydroptilid larvae and pupae were not separable to species, hydropti 1 id pupae also being inseparable to genus. Pupae of Nectopsyche were not distinguishable to species and adults of Nectopsyche also difficult to separate. Larvae of the bifida group of the genus Hydropsyche and female pupae of H. bifida and H. bronta were not separated to species. Life history patterns of Saskatchewan River system Trichoptera were discussed based mainly on collections of pupae and adults. Species distribution in the Saskatchewan River system was discussed, with emphasis on man's possible role in affecting species distribution and relative abundance. North American distribution patterns exhibited by species collected in this study were related to recent geological events and to patterns exhibited by some other aquatic invertebrate groups...|$|R

The award is presented annually to the outstanding graduate of the USAF Weapons School.

The trophy is permanently displayed at the United States Air Force Academy, with each winner’s name inscribed. A miniature replica, also donated by Perot, is presented to each year’s recipient as a personal memento. An identical casting, measuring four feet and weighing 300 pounds, was installed in the foyer of the USAF Weapons School at Nellis Air Force Base in October 1984.|$|E
25|$|As the {{commemorative}} coin act legislation was pending, the DAV announced in March 2008 an additional donation of $600,000—half of {{which came from}} the state chapter in California, and half {{of which was a}} matching donation by the DAV. But although the national DAV had pledged to match state donations up to $3 million (for a total DAV state and national contribution of $6 million), $2.4 million of the pledge was still unfulfilled by early 2008. A second major memorial donation came in April 2008 when businessman <b>H.</b> <b>Ross</b> Perot agreed to give three annual payments of $1 million each to the DVLMF. Perot's contribution (the largest yet from an individual or group not already associated with the memorial foundation) brought the total amount of funds raised for construction and maintenance to $55.1 million. At this point, the DVLMF still claimed they only needed $65 million to begin construction. News sources reported that the foundation intended to begin and finish construction in 2010.|$|E
2500|$|The {{selected}} {{design was}} very controversial, in particular its unconventional design, its black color and {{its lack of}} ornamentation.

Said Webb, “I never in my wildest dreams imagined such a nihilistic slab of stone.” [...] James Watt, Secretary of the Interior under President Ronald Reagan, initially refused to issue a building permit for the memorial due to the public outcry about the design.|$|E
