However, the attractiveness evaluation methods currently available lack versatility to analyze diverse attractiveness phenomena in different kinds of places and spatial scales. This article describes a novel method, called M-Attract, to assess the attractiveness of interesting places, based on movement data. M-Attract examines trajectory episodes (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>stop,</b> pass) that happen in places and their encompassing regions to compute their attractiveness. It is more flexible than state-of-the-art methods, with respect to land parcels, parameters, and measures used for attractiveness assessment. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated in experiments with real data, which demonstrate its contributions to analyze attractiveness of places and identify relevant phenomena in the geographic space...|$|E

30|$|Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is the {{rate-limiting enzyme}} in lipolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in the circulation. It is {{synthesized}} in parenchymal cells of adipose tissue {{as well as}} in skeletal and cardiac muscle, and it is then transferred to heparan sulfate-binding sites of the vascular endothelium (Kastelein et al. 2000). The hydrolytic function of LPL is important for the processing of triglyceride-rich chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins to remnant particles {{as well as for the}} transfer of phospholipids and apolipoproteins to high density lipoproteins (HDLs). LPL also plays an important role in the receptor-mediated removal of lipoproteins from the circulation (Groenemeijer et al. 1997). LPL is polymorphic, with amino acid substitutions of the encoded protein affecting triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol levels, which are implicated in atherosclerosis risk (Wittrup et al. 1999). The 1595 C→G (Ser 447 Stop) substitution of LPL results in carboxyl-terminal truncation of LPL by two amino acids. This change is thought to increase the binding affinity of the protein for receptors or to facilitate or otherwise affect its formation of dimers (Wittrup et al. 1999). The <b>G</b> (<b>Stop)</b> allele of the 1595 C→G (Ser 447 Stop) polymorphism has also been shown to be related to decreased plasma triglyceride or increased HDL-cholesterol levels, or both (Groenemeijer et al. 1997; Jemaa et al. 1995; Kuivenhoven et al. 1997; Wittrup et al. 1999). In addition, the <b>G</b> (<b>Stop)</b> allele of this polymorphism was found to be associated with a reduced risk of CHD or MI (Wittrup et al. 1999; Yamada et al. 2006; Yang et al. 2004). Evidence suggests that the catalytic activity and stability of the truncated variant of LPL may be largely normal, but that it may be present at higher concentrations in the circulation, resulting in a higher level of LPL activity (Groenemeijer et al. 1997; Henderson et al. 1999; Humphries et al. 1998; Zhang et al. 1996).|$|E

The final sample consisted of 45 adults (18 - 50 years). Perceptual and behavioral inhibition shows moderate and low correlations with attentional cost, cognitive inhibition shows no relation with flexibility and only perceptual inhibition predicts switching costs effects, suggesting that different inhibitory processes contribute differentially to switch cost.

Electric bicycles, the most popular electric vehicles, subscribe to this type of transportation, being very environmentally friendly. They have several advantages when compared to traditional bicycles, but also a weak point in terms of long battery (re) charging duration. Consequently power-saving solutions for electric bicycles are of high research interest. This paper proposes a novel V 2 X communication-based power-saving strategy for electric bicycles. To the best knowledge of the authors, so far, there is no work in the literature that makes use of V 2 X communications in the context of electric bicycles. The proposed solution involves recommendations for strategic riding when bicycles approach intersections to avoid high power consumption scenarios (e. <b>g.</b> <b>stop</b> and start due to red traffic light signal).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an autonomous robotic system that incorporates novel Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Data Mining algorithms {{in order to}} learn to navigate and discover important visual entities. This is achieved within a Learning from Demonstration (LfD) framework, where policies are derived from example state-to-action mappings.

Additionally, visual entities (road signs e. <b>g.</b> <b>STOP</b> sign) that are strongly associated to autonomously discovered modes of action (e. g. stopping behaviour) are discovered through a novel Percept-Action Mining methodology.

40|$|A {{microprocessor-based}} controller {{has been}} developed that continuously monitors and adjusts the gripping force applied by a special two-finger gripper. This computerized force sensing gripper system enables the endeffector gripping action to be independently detected and corrected. The gripping force applied to a manipulated object is real-time monitored for problem situations, situations which can occur during both planned and errant robot arm manipulation. When unspecified force conditions occur at the gripper, the gripping force controller initiates specific reactions to cause dynamic corrections to the continuously variable gripping action. The force controller for this intelligent gripper has been interfaced to the controller of an industrial robot. The gripper and robot controllers communicate to accomplish the successful completion of normal gripper operations as well as unexpected hazardous situations. An example of an unexpected gripping condition would be the sudden deformation of the object being manipulated by the robot. The capabilities of the interfaced gripper-robot system to apply workstation safety measures (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>stop</b> the robot) when these unexpected gripping effects occur have been assessed...|$|E

40|$|Retrieval {{effectiveness}} {{depends on}} how terms are extracted and indexed. For Chinese text (and others like Japanese and Korean), there are no space to delimit words. Indexing using hybrid terms (i. e. words and bigrams) were able to achieve the best precision amongst homogenous terms at a lower storage cost than indexing with bigrams. However, this was tested with conjunctive queries, using a small test data set. Here, we extended the vector space model using the cosine measure, for processing hybrid terms. We also introduced weighting based {{on the length of}} the term. Our evaluation shows that the averaged precision of hybrid term indexing is about the same as the best precision, achieved using bigram indexing, but incurring less storage (about 61 % of the storage for bigram indexing). The precision performance of hybrid term indexing is consistently better than that of word indexing, even though their storage cost is about the same. Ranking based on the length of the query terms slightly improves the retrieval effectiveness of hybrid term indexing but degrades the retrieval effectiveness of word indexing. Even though our best performance is the worst compared with that of the other participants, {{this may be due to}} some common factors across different indexing strategies (e. <b>g.</b> <b>stop</b> words, term weights and query term processing), and may not be due to the indexing strategies that we are evaluating...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{acoustic}} study investigates {{effects of}} boundary and prominence on the temporal structure of s#CV and #sCV in English, {{and on the}} phonetic implementation of the allophonic rule whereby a voiceless stop after /s/ becomes unaspirated. Results obtained with acoustic temporal measures for /sCV/ sequences showed that the segments at the source of prosodic strengthening (i. e., /s/ in #sCV for boundary marking and the nucleus vowel for prominence marking) were expanded in both absolute and relational terms, whereas other durational components distant from the source (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>stop</b> closure duration in #sCV) showed temporal expansion only in the absolute measure. This suggests that speakers make an extra effort to expand the very first segment and the nucleus vowel more {{than the rest of}} the sequence in order to signal the pivotal loci of the boundary vs. the prominence information. The potentially ambiguous s#CV and #sCV sequences (e. g., ice#can vs. eye#scan) were never found to be neutralized even in the phrase-internal condition, cuing the underlying syllable structures with fine phonetic detail. Most crucially, an already short lag VOT in #sCV (due to the allophonic rule) was shortened further under prosodic strengthening, which was interpreted as enhancement of the phonetic feature {voiceless unaspirated}. It was proposed that prosodic strengthening makes crucial reference to the phonetic feature system of the language and operates on a phonetic feature, including the one derived by a language-specific allophonic rule. An alternative account was also discussed in gestural terms in the framework of Articulatory Phonology...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} a participatory sensing service, called Fueoogle, that maps vehicular fuel consumption on city streets, allowing drivers {{to find the}} most fuel-efficient routes for their vehicles between arbitrary end-points. The service exploits measurements of vehicular sensors, available via the OBD-II interface that gives access to most gauges and engine instrumentation. The OBD-II sensors are standardized in all vehicles produced in the US since 1996, constituting some of the largest ``sensor deployments" to date. Using fuel-related measurements contributed by participating vehicles, we develop a route planner that maps normalized fuel-efficiency of city streets, enabling vehicles to compute minimum fuel routes from one point to another. Street congestion, elevation variability, average speed, and average distance between stops (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>stop</b> signs) lead to changes in the amount of fuel consumed making fuel-efficient routes potentially different from shortest or fastest routes, and a function of vehicle type. Our experimental study answers two questions related to the viability of the new service. First, how much fuel can it save? Second, can it survive conditions of sparse deployment? The main challenge under such conditions is to generalize from relatively sparse measurements on a subset of streets to estimates of measurements of an entire city. Through extensive experimental data collection and evaluation, conducted over the duration of a month across several different cars and drivers, we show that significant savings can be achieved by choosing the right route. We also provide extensive results pertaining to the accuracy of models that are used for prediction of fuel consumption values. unpublishednot peer reviewe...|$|E

When observed rate constants are measured using rapid-mixing (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>stopped</b> flow) methodologies, kinetic isotope fractionation can lead to a large underestimation of both the magnitude and temperature dependence of kinetic isotope effects (KIEs). This fractionation is related to the isotopic purity of the substrates used and highlights a major problem with experimental studies which measure KIEs with substrates that are not isotopically pure. As it is not always possible to prepare isotopically pure substrates, we describe two general methods for the correction, for known isotope impurities, of KIEs calculated from pre-steady-state measurements...|$|R

40|$|Liver {{fibrosis}} {{results from}} dysregulation of normal wound healing, inflammation, activation of myofibroblasts and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). Chronic liver injury causes death of hepatocytes and formation of apoptotic bodies, which in turn, release factors that recruit inflammatory cells (neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes) to the injured liver. Hepatic macrophages (Kupffer cells) produce TGF 1 and other inflammatory cytokines that activate Collagen Type I producing myofibroblasts, {{which are not}} present in the normal liver. Secretion of TGF 1 and activation of myofibroblasts {{play a critical role}} in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis of different etiologies. Although the composition of fibrogenic myofibroblasts varies dependent on etiology of liver injury, liver resident Hepatic Stellate Cells (HSCs) and Portal Fibroblasts (PFs) are the major source of myofibroblasts in fibrotic liver in both experimental models of liver fibrosis and in patients with liver disease. Several studies have demonstrated that hepatic fibrosis can reverse upon cessation of liver injury. Regression of liver fibrosis is accompanied by the disappearance of fibrogenic myofibroblasts followed by resorption of the fibrous scar. Myofibroblasts either apoptose or inactivate into a quiescent-like state (e. <b>g.</b> <b>stop</b> collagen production and partially restore expression of lypogenic genes). Resolution of liver fibrosis is associated with recruitment of macrophages that secrete matrix-degrading enzymes (matrix metalloproteinase, collagenases) and are responsible for fibrosis resolution. However, prolonged/repeated liver injury may cause irreversible crosslinking of ECM and formation of uncleavable collagen fibers. Advanced fibrosis progresses to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The current review will summarize the role and contribution of different cell types to populations of fibrogenic myofibroblasts in fibrotic liver...|$|E
40|$|Various {{aspects of}} {{linguistic}} experience influence {{the way we}} segment, represent, and process speech signals. The Japanese phonetic and orthographic systems represent geminate consonants (double consonants, e. g. /ss/, /kk/) in a unique way compared to other languages: one abstract representation is used to characterize {{the first part of}} geminate consonants despite the acoustic difference between two distinct realizations of geminate consonants (silence in the case of e. <b>g.</b> <b>stop</b> consonants and elongation in the case of fricative consonants). The current study tests this discrepancy between abstract representations and acoustic realizations influences how native speakers of Japanese perceive geminate consonants. The experiments used pseudo words containing either the geminate consonant /ss/ or a manipulated version in which the first part was replaced by silence /_s/. The sound /_s/ is acoustically similar to /ss/, yet does not occur in everyday speech. Japanese listeners demonstrated a bias to group these two types into the same category while Italian and Dutch listeners distinguished them. The results thus confirmed that distinguishing fricative geminate consonants with silence from those with sustained frication is not crucial for Japanese native listening. Based on this observation, we propose that native speakers of Japanese tend to segment geminated consonants into two parts and that the first portion of fricative geminates is perceptually similar to a silent duration. This representation is compatible with both Japanese orthography and phonology. Unlike previous studies that were inconclusive in how native speakers segment geminate consonants, our study demonstrated relatively strong effect of Japanese specific listening. Thus the current experimental methods may open up new lines of investigation into the relationship between development of phonological representation, orthography and speech perception...|$|E

These resources could be categorised in 3 different levels including software, platform, and infrastructure. As cloud computing gains traction, there is an increasing trend to switch from desktop application to cloud-based ones. In this transition IDEs are not an exception. Some cloud-based IDEs like MIDEaaS are already developed. Now {{the question is how}} these IDEs could perform SW development and deployment. The present thesis implements a cloud-based SW development demonstrator and investigates issues of such an implementation. Developers should be able to use our demonstrator to develop an application and deploy it into the best Platform as a Service (PaaS) provider among the available PaaS providers. The SW development practice our demonstrator follows is continuous deployment which automates phases of SW development cycle including build and release. Since this thesis is part of EASI-CLOUDS project, adopting our demonstrator to multi-provider PaaS architecture is by utilising EASI-CLOUDS platform. EASI-CLOUDS platform federates available clouds (in our case PaaS providers) and negotiates relationship between them and cloud consumer (in our case developers). Due to these two goals, two components (ACCORDS and COAPS) are developed in EASI-CLOUDS project. Based on the way ACCORDS performs to broker and ﬁnd the most suitable PaaS provider, two use cases are presented. First use case is based on deferred deployment method of ACCORDS which allows a developer to have control (e. <b>g.</b> <b>stop,</b> start, undeploy, etc.) over his deployed applications on the target PaaS. This use case was not feasible since current implementation of ACCORDS does not support it. Second use case is based on immediate deployment method of ACCORDS.

40|$|Literacy {{learning}} is {{often viewed as}} a complex, dynamic, and transactive process where literacy refers to the interrelatedness of language- speaking, listening, reading, writing, and viewing. As a process, {{we know that it}} begins long before children enter a classroom or school. Like learning to speak and listen, learning about print and those things associated with it begins at home starting from birth when parents read or tell stories, when songs are sung and nursery rhymes chanted, when scribbles on a page are seen and understood to have some meaning. Literacy teachers and scholars currently have a fairly well-developed understanding of how young children become aware of print (Teale 2 ̆ 6 Sulzby, 1989) and begin their entry into the literacy club (Smith, 2005). Studies of children as young as 2 demonstrate they are able to identify signs, labels, and logos that are familiar to them (Goodman, 1986; Hiebert, 1981). Correspondingly, home-based case studies conducted with {{children under the age of}} 3 found that children are extensively aware of the practical functions for writing: creating a list to aid memory, writing signs to control behaviors (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>stop</b> signs), and writing to communicate (Heath, 1983; Taylor 2 ̆ 6 Strickland, 1986). These early understandings of literacy are often referred to by the term emergent literacy (Teale, 1986). Emergent literacy suggests that the development of literacy is taking place within the child. It is a gradual process and will take place over time. Emergent literacy focuses on two aspects: (1) how and when children begin to construct knowledge about reading and writing and (2) how parents and early childhood educators could most effectively support young children 2 ̆ 7 s ongoing literacy development (Morrow, 2001) ...|$|E

By introducing video interaction, applications such as VoD, interactive TV or multimedia information systems will benefit and can offer additional features for the user. The video application and basic system "MOVieGoer"; developed at ZGDV, considers the hypermedia aspect of sensitive regions - the use as a dynamic anchor for information retrieval from inside the video stream. Typical application domains for the MOVieGoer concept are, e. g., interactive program journals, advertisements, news, exhibitions, shopping, and teaching scenarios. Bes ides the use inside advanced online services, MOVieGoer, combined with set-top boxes, provides a natural synthesis {{of the internet and}} interactive television.

This study varied the type of misleading information to include consistent gist, inconsistent gist and consistent details as well as inconsistent (or altered) details. Misinformation studies follow a three-stage procedure: an initial event, misleading information, and a final memory test. Here, too, adult participants initially observed a slide sequence. Misinformation was embedded in a comprehension test and memory was tested with a recognition test. The timing of the misleading information and {{the timing of the}} final memory test resulted in three between-subjects levels: Immediate misinformation and Immediate recognition test, Immediate misinformation and Delayed recognition test, Delayed misinformation and Delayed recognition test. The delay was one week after the initial slide observation. The final recognition test queried memory for what subjects saw (a Yes-No "verbatim" task) and what they believed to be true (a True-False gist-based judgment). All subjects judged misleading items (lures) and original items for each kind of misleading information. Subjects also rated confidence for each answer. Descriptions and examples of all stimuli are provided in the Appendices. An analysis of variance conducted on the signed confidence data (judgment combined with confidence) revealed significant differences among the types of misleading information (gist consistent had highest rates of recognition, inconsistent items were rejected but less so when subjects were misled), differences between Yes-No "verbatim" and True-False judgments (truth ratings were greater than the verbatim ratings but were equally high for consistent gist), different effects of forgetting (decreased recognition of originals, increased recognition of lures), and significant misinformation effects. Memory dependency analyses revealed that the relationship between memory for an event and memory for misleading information depends on the type of information, whether gist or detail in nature. Results are discussed in terms of storage explanations (e. g., discrepancy detection, misinformation acceptance), retrieval accounts (e. g., coexistence, blocking, discrimination) and fuzzy-trace theory. The conclusions support, in general, predictions from fuzzy-trace theory. Implications for eyewitness testimony include the importance of early, neutral questioning...|$|E

In this paper we illustrate the advantages of sequential methods (e. <b>g.</b> early <b>stopping,</b> power analysis etc.) and conclude {{that there is much}} to learn from clinical trials...|$|R
