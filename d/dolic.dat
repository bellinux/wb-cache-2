5000|$|The name Gornji <b>Dolič</b> (literally, 'upper Dolič') {{distinguishes the}} village from Srednji <b>Dolič</b> (literally, 'middle Dolič') and Spodnji <b>Dolič</b> (literally, 'lower Dolič') [...] The name {{dates from the}} time before {{what is now the}} main road was built through the Bad Hole Gorge (Huda lukjna). Along the {{original}} road from Slovenj Gradec to Vitanje, which passed near Turjak Hill (800 m), it was the highest of the three villages—but today's village center is in fact some 40 m lower in elevation than the other two villages. The village was known as Zgornji <b>Dolič</b> in Slovene until the Second World War, and it was named Oberdollitsch in German in the past.|$|E

5000|$|The {{author of}} the visual {{identity}} is Croatian graphic designer Jurica <b>Dolić,</b> who described his solution as follows:"The visual identity embodies the verbal identity aspect by incorporating {{the symbol of the}} heart (shape, red colour) and mind (circle, blue colour). It also embodies a number of other symbols which have an exceptional importance for the candidature of Zagreb and Rijeka: Colours - red, white and blue are the representative colours of Croatian national symbols. Red is the colour of Rijeka, while blue is the representative colour of Zagreb. Shapes - white shapes (inside the blue circle) symbolize the number 16 (year of holding the Games - 2016). Furthermore, these shapes denote the silhouette of “Zagi” (the exceptionally popular mascot of the Zagreb Universiade from 1987), and in the combination with the red colour of the heart portrays a flame as the symbol of the sporting and Olympic spirit." ...|$|E
50|$|Gornji <b>Dolič</b> {{was heavily}} {{involved}} in the Second World War. On 1 December 1941 saboteurs dynamited the railroad bridge between Paka pri Velenju and the Bad Hole Gorge (Huda luknja). The Navršnik farm in the settlement was a center of Partisan resistance. Partisan forces dynamited the railway on 31 September 1942, burned the railway station in the settlement on 27 October 1942, attacked and destroyed the railway station again {{at the end of}} March 1944, derailed a train into the Huda Luknja Gorge on 10 April 1944, sent a burning train towards Velenje on 25 April 1944 and burned the bus station the same day, burned another train on 26 April 1944, attached a German post in the Huda Luknja Gorge on 3 June 1944, and destroyed the railroad bridge on 18 June 1944 and dynamited the railroad tunnel the same day. Between 12 and 14 May 1945 there was heavy fighting between Mislinja and the Huda Luknja Gorge, resulting in several hundred deaths.|$|E
5000|$|Right after Mohács, Jovan Nenad {{appeared}} between Tisza and Danube as {{a leader}} of a Serb regiment. He quickly drove the Ottomans from Bačka and parts of Banat and Syrmia, which he then ruled independently. At first he sided with the Zapolyai, however, after the Hungarian nobility of Bačka estranged him from John Zápolya (who also refused to acknowledge Nenad's territory), he decided to support the Habsburg pretender, Ferdinand, in the beginning of 1527. The conflict with the Hungarian nobility arose when Hungarian refugees were refused to return to Bačka, which Nenad saw as his. He named Radoslav Čelnik the general commander of his army, while his emissaries to foreign rulers were Fabijan Literat, a Franciscan from Ilok, Ivan <b>Dolić,</b> the castellan of Bač from Irig. His treasurer and palatine was Subota Vrlić from Jagodina. Besides his main army, he also organized a personal guard numbering 600 soldiers. His army grew by drawing Serbs from Ottoman territory, Vlachs from Banat and Transylvania, and also some Roman Catholics, and by the beginning of 1527, it numbered around 15,000 men. It is believed that the cooperation of Orthodox and Catholic Slavs was the key of his later success. By the time of the reign of Jovan Nenad, Serbs had already considerable populations in the southern Pannonian Plain, most notably in the Danube and Tisa regions (a region commonly known as [...] "Rascia"). Jovan Nenad considered the struggle around the Hungarian throne just a temporary occupation, his primary task being the fight against the Ottomans for the liberation of the Serb lands. In the first half of 1527, Ferdinand was outside of Hungary, preparing for what would become the Hungarian campaign of 1527-28 to fight Zápolya. During that time, King Zápolya sent armies after Jovan Nenad, wishing to settle his internal affairs before Ferdinand could return to Hungary. Underestimating Nenad's strength, Zápolya sent 300 knights under László Csáky, which were defeated by Jovan Nenad in early April, Csáky himself was captured and executed. After this, Jovan Nenad rose to the peak of his power and he styled himself Emperor. Another Hungarian army was dispatched, led by the Voivode of Transylvania, Péter Perényi. It was defeated by late April near Tiszaszőlős (Battle of Szőlős) {{on the banks of the}} Tisza river. Finally, a second army, which encompassed the entire strength of Transylvania and upper Hungary, led by Perényi and Bishop Czibak decisively defeated Jovan's army in the Battle of Sződfalva, killing around 8,000 of his men.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} estrogens on bone tissue in males {{have not been}} well established. We had the {{opportunity}} to observe several bone parameters in two estrogen deficient men (both were 28 years old). They presented a typical phenotype of a congenital aromatase deficiency. The first patient presented an homozigous mutation of the exon V of the CYP 19 gene from ACG to ACA affecting the splicing of the RNA and associated with an androgen deficiency and a crypthorquidism. He had <b>dolic</b> biotype features in head, mainly due to basal jaw development. Mid-shaft cortical area (Act), cross sectionals moments of inertia (CSMI), volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) and stress-strain indexes (SSI) of bone resistance to deformations were estimated at different sites (tibia, radio, jaw) by tridimensional tomography (XCT 3000 - Stratec, Pforzheim). Structural deformations were clearly ob- served at mid-shafts Act; over-normal vBMD values were clearly observed at jaws (from 1255 - 1355 mg/cm 3); threshold analysis showed an irregular distribution of the area with a high bone density (over 700 mg); SSIpolarand SSIx. axis indexes were appar- ently normal but CSMIs were variable. The second patient had a mutation in the exon IV from ATG to AGG, methionine to arginine. But it is an heterozygous mutation of the CYP 19 gen. He presented a phenotype of estrogen and aromatase deficiencies. Cephalometrywas over normal value for the race and sex (+ 3 SD). Specifically, perialveolar, not basals, are preserved. Histomorphometric analysis of transiliac bone biopsy performed after double tetracycline labelling showed a high bone turnover with an active osteoblastic synthesis. The eroded surfaces were 2. 7 fold higher than controls, osteoid surfaces and volume were increased by x 2. 6 and x 2. 8 respectively. The mineralising surfaces were extended at 21. 7 %. There was no mineralization defect. These findings may be explained from different viewpoints, including: 1 - Mechanically, bone alterations may correspond to a non-directional modelling and remodelling since born, and cortical changes may be an adaptive mechanism 2 - Metabolically, long-term non-hormonal controlled bone turnover may disturb directional modelling and remodelling resulting in deformations. Despite mechanisms, bone quality in these two males without estrogens synthesis is abnormal, although resistance is still acceptable...|$|E
