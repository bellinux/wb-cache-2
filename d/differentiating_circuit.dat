The circuit works by inverting and multiplying {{the effect of the}} capacitor in an RC <b>differentiating</b> <b>circuit</b> where the voltage across the resistor R behaves through time {{in the same manner as}} the voltage across an inductor.

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{is made of}} the line source (LS) method and the differential line source (DLS) method of measuring thermal conductivity of particulate materials in vacuum. The DLS method requires more instrumentation in the measuring circuitry (an additional amplifier and a <b>differentiating</b> <b>circuit),</b> but since {{it does not require}} a stable temperature to initiate a test, it does not need a sample temperature control system. DLS tests can be taken as the temperature in the samples is rising from liquid nitrogen temperature to room temperature. This eliminates the practice of extrapolating thermal conductivity over this large temperature range. Also, the advantages of reduced test time, data reduction time, and small sample temperature rise enable the experimenter to take about 7 - 12 DLS tests in the time of 2 LS tests. Test data from the two methods agree very well...|$|E
40|$|A {{particular}} application {{requires a}} voltage pulse of l/ 100 th microsec. duration, 30 volts amplitude and 100 kc/sec. recurrence frequency. Methods usually employed for low-frequency, microsecond duration impulses are found inadequate. The author analyzes, using the La Place transform theory, the transient response of two circuits. The <b>differentiating</b> <b>circuit</b> is found impractical. Class C {{operation of a}} pentode, having sinusoidal input, with a parallel LC plate circuit can give the desired pulse. For analysis an idealized plate current-grid bias characteristic is used. The transient response of a 6 mc/sec. circuit to a 700 kc/sec. input was measured. Definite values of Gm and Eco {{can be obtained from}} measured Ip - Eg curves which give correlation between calculated and experimental transient response.

40|$|The {{responses}} of integrating and <b>differentiating</b> <b>circuits</b> to a pulse front time rises linearly up {{to a certain}} time and then flattens out have been studied, Generally, the analysis of such circuits is made by assuming the input pulse -to be a step-function. That the responses obtained by such an analysis are much different from those found {{in the case of a}} linearly rising pulse that flattens out after a certain time, has been shown clearly in both cases of cascaded <b>differentiating</b> and integrating <b>circuits.</b> When the rise time is very short, the output pulse shape becomes almost similar to that in the case of step-function input pulse. As the rise time and the number of cascaded sections increase, the magnitude as well as the rate of rise of the integrated output pulse sharply begins to diminish. In the case of differentiation, the maximum output voltage depends very much upon the rise time...|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} {{to reduce the}} Brownian deflections of electrometer systems. This is achieved by replacing the air damping by a special type of artificial damping. The latter is realised {{by means of a}} photoelectric amplifier containing a <b>differentiating</b> <b>circuit,</b> comp. fig. 1. The amount of light entering the photocell is made proportional to the deflection of the electrometer system and the output of the amplifier is fed back to the electrometer. The motion of the electrometer is studied with a photoelectric relay and a recording galvanometer allowing a magnification up to 14300. The application of this method of damping has already resulted in a hundred fold reduction of the Brownian energy and an increase in precision of a factor of ten. In order to reach the same accuracy with normal air-damping it should be necessary to cool the instrument to 3 °K...|$|E
40|$|A {{system for}} the {{generation}} of short electrical pulses based on the minority carrier charge storage and the step recovery effect of bipolar transistors is presented. Electrical pulses of about 90 ps up to 800 ps duration are generated with a maximum amplitude of approximately 7 V at 50 Ω. The bipolar transistor is driven into saturation and the base-collector and base-emitter junctions become forward biased. The resulting fast switch-off edge of the transistor’s output signal {{is the basis for}} the pulse generation. The fast switching of the transistor occurs {{as a result of the}} minority carriers that have been injected and stored across the base-collector junction under forward bias conditions. If the saturated transistor is suddenly reverse biased the pn-junction will appear as a low impedance until the stored charge is depleted. Then the impedance will suddenly increase to its normal high value and the flow of current through the junction will turn to zero, abruptly. A differentiation of the output signal of the transistor results in two short pulses with opposite polarities. The <b>differentiating</b> <b>circuit</b> is implemented by a transmission line network, which mainly acts as a high pass filter. Both the transistor technology (pnp or npn) and the phase of the transfer function of the differentating circuit influence the polarity of the output pulses. The pulse duration depends on the transistor parameters as well as on the transfer function of the pulse shaping network. This way of generating short electrical pulses is a new alternative for conventional comb generators based on steprecovery diodes (SRD). Due to the three-terminal structure of the transistor the isolation problem between the input and the output signal of the transistor network is drastically simplified. Furthermore the transistor is an active element in contrast to a SRD, so that its current gain can be used to minimize the power of the driving signal...|$|E
40|$|The main {{topic of}} this work {{is the study of}} {{detector}} systems composed of a scintillator, a photodetector and readout electronics, for Positron Emission Tomography (PET). In particular, the timing properties of such detector systems are studied. The first idea is {{to take advantage of the}} good timing properties of the NINO chip, which is a fast preamplifier-discriminator developed for the ALICE Time of flight detector at CERN. This chip uses a time over threshold technique that is to be applied for the first time in medical imaging applications. A unique feature of this technique is that it delivers both timing and energy information with a single digital pulse, the time stamp with the rising edge and the energy from the pulse width. This entails substantial simplification of the entire readout architecture of a tomograph. The scintillator chosen in the detector system is LSO. Crystals of 2 x 2 x 10 mm 3 were used. For the photodetector, APDs were first used, and were then replaced by SiPMs to make use of their higher gain. These different elements that constitute the whole detector system are presented, and their functioning is explained. Within the European FP 6 BioCare project, a test setup comprising 2 identical detector systems in coincidence was developed. Each one is composed of a LSO scintillator, an APD, a preamplifier and the NINO readout electronics. The energy resolution was measured to 16 % for 511 keV y-rays. This is comparable to the resolution obtainable with PMT based systems. The same APD based system was also studied with 122 keV X-rays, to assess its potential for combined PET-CT imaging. The energy resolution in this case was measured to 70 % as compared to 50 % with PMTs. This is explained by a lack of sensitivity of the readout electronics to low charges. The time resolution for 2 such detectors in coincidence was demonstrated to be of 1. 6 ns FWHM. This is 3 times worse than what one could obtain with PMT based systems under the same conditions. The contributions of the different elements of the detector system to the time precision were identified. The relative contributions of the electronics, the APD and the LSO were found to be 20 %, 30 % and 50 %, respectively. However, the fact that the LSO crystal dominates the time resolution is partly attributed to the readout mechanism of the APD. The relatively low gain of the APD prevents the readout electronics from detecting fewer than 20 photoelectrons coming from the LSO whereas the PMT is sensitive to a single photon. Therefore, a new photodetector was chosen and characterized: the Silicon PhotoMultiplier (SiPM). This photodetector finds increasing interest in the scientific community, offering better characteristics than APD in terms of gain and of single photon sensitivity. They could also be used for TOF applications in PET. The SiPM used were supplied by ST microelectronics and tested at CERN in the context of a scientific collaboration. SiPM from Hamamatsu were also tested for comparison. The study of a 1 x 1 mm 2 SiPM has demonstrated that the time resolution of the SiPM coupled to the NINO chip is of 180 ps rms from the detection of single 405 nm laser photon. This means that this combination of SiPM+NINO can also be used as a detector system for the detection of single photons such as in Cerenkov light detection or in fluorescence spectroscopy, where good time precision is required. In the case of PET, the response of the SiPM to LSO photons following the interaction of a 511 keV y-ray was modeled. Since in this case the output current from the SiPM is too high to be directly read out by the NINO circuit, an interface consisting of a <b>differentiating</b> <b>circuit</b> was developed. Furthermore, the typical size of LSO crystals (2 x 2 mm 2) together with the high number of SPAD cells required to detect the photons emitted by the LSO implies that larger size SiPM (3 x 3 mm 2) have to be used. The work done during the thesis has shown a crucial influence of the SiPM terminal capacitance, which may be as high as 320 pF for the Hamamatsu SiPM of 3 x 3 mm 2. In contrast with SiPMs of smaller size, this capacitance in parallel with a load resistance (e. g. scope or NINO) is large enough to significantly increase the rise time of the SPAD signals to the extent that the timing performance of the ensemble is severely degraded. An improved electronics interface is currently being studied to overcome this limitation. Another novel photodetector has also been studied in the context of this thesis: the microchannel plate (MCP) that is made of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H). The first samples were developed at the Institute of MicroTechnology (IMT) of Neuchatel and tested at CERN in a scientific collaboration. The advantage of this detector is the possibility to deposit on top of ASIC in a direct and vertical integration. Our preliminary investigation indicate that a current increase takes place along the borders of the MCP pores, possibly indicating the generation of a cascade of secondary electrons...|$|E
40|$|The {{nucleus accumbens}} (NAc) has {{been implicated in}} a variety of {{associative}} processes that are dependent on the integrity of the amygdala and hippocampus (HPC). However, {{the extent to which the}} two subregions of the NAc, the core and shell, form <b>differentiated</b> <b>circuits</b> within the amygdala- and hippocampal-ventral striatal circuitry remains unclear. The present study investigated the effects of selective excitotoxic lesions of the nucleus accumbens shell or core subregion on appetitive elemental cue and context conditioning, shown previously to be dependent on the basolateral amygdala and hippocampus, respectively. Rats were trained sequentially to acquire discrete conditioned stimulus-sucrose conditioning, followed by spatial context-sucrose conditioning in a place preference apparatus characterized by three topographically identical chambers, the chambers being discriminable only on the basis of path integration. NAc shell lesions selectively impaired the acquisition of conditioned place preference and the use of spatial information to retrieve information about a discrete cue, whereas, as expected, NAc core lesions attenuated the acquisition of cue conditioning compared with sham rats. In a subsequent experiment, disconnection of the HPC from the NAc shell using unilateral asymmetric lesions of each structure resulted in a pattern of impairment in place conditioning and context-dependent cue retrieval similar to that produced by NAc shell lesions. These data not only suggest that the NAc core and shell subregions subserve distinct associative processes but also that the NAc shell and HPC are important functional components of a limbic corticostriatal network involved in spatial context conditioning...|$|R

A straightforward method to obtain offspring efficiently by crossover and mutation, crucial to an optimization problem with severe restrictions, has succeeded in obtaining optimal circuits for large scale high-level synthesis replete with parallel computation. The method can create offspring by means of remedying faulty genes without causing other remedies of previously determined genes or using backtracking.

40|$|Living {{systems can}} adapt to {{injuries}} and even heal themselves, an ability desirable also in synthetic systems. A method is presented for dynamically adapting {{the construction of}} an electronic circuit to hardware defects by formulating the process as a series of interactions between identical but specialized structures called supercells. The circuit components, including wires, can occupy any place in the hardware that has been determined to be free of defects. The circuit specification is reduced to a connected graph, with no positional information, and provided as a code repeated in each supercell. Using the code, supercells <b>differentiate</b> into <b>circuit</b> components in a late stage of the process, with with highly adaptable physical location and organization; supercells also form the wires between circuit components. The structure and function of the system at three major levels is presented, the lowest cellular level, the supercell, and the target circuit level. Adaptation of circuit construction to defective hardware was observed for this method. Results obtained from this development process on simulated and real hardware with a variety of defect types and defect patterns are presented, as well as higher level simulations of the algorithm and its response to a wider range of defect patterns, amounts of hardware, and hardware to fault ratios...|$|R
40|$|NanoMagnet Logic (NML) is an {{emerging}} technol- ogy that allows to design digital circuits using nanomagnets. Each magnet {{has only two}} possible states and encodes digital informa- tion {{without the need for}} currents or voltages. This behavior <b>differentiates</b> NML <b>circuits</b> from charge based technologies. The advantages provided by NML circuits are a possible very low power consumption, and the ability to mix logic and memory in the same device. While a rich experimental activity on NML circuits can be found in literature, the feasibility of a complete NML system remains to be demonstrated yet. In this work we explore the possibility of implementing NML logic circuits based on the physical structure of Magnetic RAM (M-RAM). The advantages are twofold: First, M-RAM is a well developed technology, ready for the commercial stage, second it intrinsically provides an interface toward the CMOS world. To demonstrate the feasibility of NML circuits based on M-RAM we have designed a 3 -input Ex-OR gate, using two different physical layouts for control signals. The first solution is strictly based on the M-RAM structure; the second solution requires a more complex fabrication process but leads to a smaller area. Circuits are simulated using VHDL language, {{with the aid of a}} tool that we have developed which automatically generates the VHDL code starting from the circuit layout. Overall, the solution here presented is a considerable step-forward toward the development of a complete magnetic circui...|$|R
40|$|Many of the interneuron cell types {{present in}} the adult spinal cord {{contribute}} to the circuits that control locomotion and posture. Little is known, however, about the embryonic origin of these cell types or the molecular mechanisms that control their differentiation. Here we provide evidence that V 1 interneurons (INs), an embryonic class of interneurons that transiently express the En 1 transcription factor, <b>differentiate</b> as local <b>circuit</b> inhibitory interneurons and form synapses with motor neurons. Furthermore, we show that a subset of V 1 INs differentiates as Renshaw cells, the interneuronal cell type that mediates recurrent inhibition of motor neurons. We analyze the role that two V 1 IN-related transcription factor genes play in Renshaw cell development. Pax 6 (paired box gene 6) is necessary for an early step in Renshaw cell development, whereas Engrailed 1 (En 1), which is genetically downstream of Pax 6, regulates the formation of inhibitory synapses between Renshaw cells and motor neurons. Together, these results show that Pax 6 and En 1 have essential roles in establishing the recurrent inhibitory circuit between motor neurons and Renshaw cells...|$|R

It pays special attention to meeting two challenges: model development and real-time reasoning. In terms of the challenge of model development, we use a dynamic fault tree model to capture the dynamic behavior of system failure mechanisms and calculate some reliability results by mapping a dynamic fault tree into an equivalent Bayesian Network (BN) {{in order to avoid}} the infamous state space explosion problem. In terms of the real-time reasoning challenge, we adopt a logic compilation based inference algorithm, which compiles the BN into an arithmetic circuit and retrieves answers to probabilistic queries by evaluating and <b>differentiating</b> the arithmetic <b>circuit.</b> Furthermore, we incorporate sensors data into fault diagnosis, cope with the sensors reliability and propose the schemes on how to update the Diagnostic Importance Factor (DIF) and the minimal cut sets.

40|$|Different {{forms of}} nondeclarative {{learning}} involve regionally specific striatal circuits. The motor circuit (involving the putamen) {{has been associated}} with motor–skill learning and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) circuit (involving the caudate) {{has been associated with}} cognitive–habit learning. Efforts to <b>differentiate</b> functional striatal <b>circuits</b> within patient samples have been limited. Previous studies have provided mixed results regarding striatal-dependent nondeclarative learning deficits in patients with schizophrenia. In this study, a cognitive–habit learning task (probabilistic weather prediction) was used to assess the DLPFC circuit and a motor–skill learning task (pursuit rotor) was used to assess the motor circuit in 35 patients with schizophrenia and 35 normal controls. Patients with schizophrenia displayed significant performance differences from controls on both nondeclarative tasks; however, cognitive–habit learning rate in patients did not differ from controls. There were performance and learning-rate differences on the motor–skill learning task between the whole sample of patients and controls, however, analysis of a subset of patients and controls matched on general intellectual level eliminated learning rate differences between groups. The abnormal performance offset between patients with schizophrenia and controls in the absence of learning rate differences suggests that abnormal cortical processing provides altered input to normal striatal circuitry...|$|R
40|$|In most species, {{self-sustained}} molecular clocks regulate 24 -h {{rhythms of}} behavior and physiology. In mammals, a circadian pacemaker residing in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) receives photic signals from the retina and synchronizes subordinate clocks in non-SCN tissues. The emergence of circadian rhythmicity during development has been extensively studied for many years. In mice, neuronal development in the presumptive SCN region of the embryonic hypothalamus occurs on days 12 - 15 of gestation. Intra-SCN <b>circuits</b> <b>differentiate</b> during the following days and retinal projections reach the SCN, and thus mediate photic entrainment, only after birth. In contrast the genetic components of the clock gene machinery are expressed much earlier and during midgestation SCN explants and isolated neurons are capable of generating molecular oscillations in culture. In vivo metabolic rhythms in the SCN, however, are observed not earlier than the 19 th day of rat gestation, and rhythmic expression of clock genes is hardly detectable until after birth. Together these data indicate that cellular coupling and, thus, tissue-wide synchronization of single-cell rhythms, may only develop very late during embryogenesis. In this mini-review we describe the developmental origin of the SCN structure and summarize our current knowledge about the functional initiation and entrainment of the circadian pacemaker during embryonic development...|$|R
40|$|Highly {{organised}} and <b>differentiated</b> neural <b>circuits</b> {{form and}} unite {{to link the}} cortex with the basal ganglia and thalamus to mediate movement, cognition and behaviour. Previous assertions that the basal ganglia primarily acted to filter cortical information to facilitate motor outputs only have since given way {{to an understanding of}} the basal ganglia as a relay and gating structure with functionally and structurally segregated inputs, functions and outputs. Thus, cortical – basal ganglia circuits can be segregated into three broadly separable functional domains mediating motor (primary and supplementary motor cortex (SMA) and putamen), cognitive (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and caudate), and limbic (ventromedial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum (VS)) processes. In addition, cognitive and behavioural programs that pass through the cortical – basal ganglia circuitry can be subject to filtering by the subthalamic nucleus (STN), which receives direct projections from the cortex. This work first demonstrated the functional organisation of segregated intrinsic cortical – basal ganglia circuits in humans, alongside a detailed map of functional subzones within STN, a small and technically inaccessible midbrain structure. The behavioural relevance of the defined cortical – basal ganglia circuits was investigated by examining the cognitive constructs of impulsivity and compulsivity. Waiting impulsivity, a tendency towards rapid premature responses that has been associated with compulsive drug use, was associated with connectivity between limbic regions including subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, VS and STN. However, motor impulsivity, in the form of stopping ability, was associated with motoric regions including pre-SMA and STN. Compulsivity was captured as deficits in: reversal learning, implicating lateral orbitofrontal cortex; attentional shifting, implicating dlPFC; and habit learning, implicating SMA. Neural circuit changes were also examined in individuals with alcohol dependence and binge drinkers. Waiting impulsivity was elevated in both groups and the functional connectivity, microstructural integrity and anatomical connectivity of the neural circuit underlying waiting impulsivity were associated with problematic drinking behaviours in both groups. Together, this work establishes that discrete functional subzones of small subcortical regions can be differentiated in humans and that their behavioural correlates can be similarly mapped. The definition of intrinsic network architecture underlying a particular behaviour and the demonstration its disturbance in psychiatric groups will crucially inform the development of future diagnostic and therapeutic models...|$|R
40|$|A {{possible}} {{functional role}} of finger representations {{for the development}} of early numerical cognition {{has been the subject of}} recent debate; however, until now, only behavioral studies have directly supported this view. Working from recent models of number processing, we focused on the neural networks involved in numerical tasks and their relationship to the areas underlying finger representations and saccades in children aged 6 – 12 [*]years. We were able to <b>differentiate</b> three parietal <b>circuits</b> that were related to distinct aspects of number processing. Abstract magnitude processing was subserved by an association area also activated by saccades and visually guided finger movements. Addition processes led to activation in an area only engaged during saccade encoding, whereas counting processes resulted in the activation of an area only activated during visually guided finger movements, namely in the anterior intraparietal sulcus. Apart from this area, a large network of specifically finger-related brain areas including the ventral precentral sulcus, supplementary motor area, dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex, insula, thalamus, midbrain, and cerebellum was activated during (particularly non-symbolic) exact addition but not during magnitude comparison. Moreover, a finger-related activation cluster in the right ventral precentral sulcus was only present during non-symbolic addition and magnitude comparison, but not during symbolic number processing tasks. We conclude that finger counting may critically mediate the step from non-symbolic to symbolic and exact number processing via somatosensory integration processes and therefore represents an important example of embodied cognition...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{mammalian}} {{arcuate nucleus}} (ARC) houses neurons critical for energy homeostasis and sexual maturation. Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and Neuropeptide Y (NPY) neurons function to balance energy intake and Kisspeptin neurons {{are critical for}} the onset of puberty and reproductive function. While the physiological roles of these neurons have been well established, their development remains unclear. We have previously shown that Notch signaling {{plays an important role}} in cell fate within the ARC of mice. Active Notch signaling prevented neural progenitors from <b>differentiating</b> into feeding <b>circuit</b> neurons, whereas conditional loss of Notch signaling lead to a premature differentiation of these neurons. Presently, we hypothesized that Kisspeptin neurons would similarly be affected by Notch manipulation. To address this, we utilized mice with a conditional deletion of the Notch signaling co-factor Rbpj-κ (Rbpj cKO), or mice persistently expressing the Notch 1 intracellular domain (NICD tg) within Nkx 2. 1 expressing cells of the developing hypothalamus. Interestingly, we found that in both models, a lack of Kisspeptin neurons are observed. This suggests that Notch signaling must be properly titrated for formation of Kisspeptin neurons. These results led us to hypothesize that Kisspeptin neurons of the ARC may arise from a different lineage of intermediate progenitors than NPY neurons and that Notch was responsible for the fate choice between these neurons. To determine if Kisspeptin neurons of the ARC differentiate similarly through a Pomc intermediate, we utilized a genetic model expressing the tdTomato fluorescent protein in all cells that have ever expressed Pomc. We observed some Kisspeptin expressing neurons labeled with the Pomc reporter similar to NPY neurons, suggesting that these distinct neurons can arise from a common progenitor. Finally, we hypothesized that temporal differences leading to premature depletion of progenitors in cKO mice lead to our observed phenotype. Using a BrdU birthdating paradigm, we determined the percentage of NPY and Kisspeptin neurons born on embryonic days 11. 5, 12. 5, and 13. 5. We found no difference in the timing of differentiation of either neuronal subtype, with a majority occurring at e 11. 5. Taken together, our findings suggest that active Notch signaling is an important molecular switch involved in instructing subpopulations of progenitor cells to differentiate into Kisspeptin neurons...|$|R
50|$|DPNSS was {{developed}} in the early 1980s by BT, or its forerunner, Post Office Telecommunications in recognition that the emerging Digital Private Circuit Primary Rate product 'Megastream' had to address the market for both data and voice, the latter being significantly greater because of the market for PBXs. At the time, BT dictated what signalling could be used on its leased lines and, whilst it only had a minority interest in the sales of PBXs, was requested by the PBX manufacturers to produce a standard to prevent the creation of a plethora of conflicting PBX protocols being developed. Under the liberalization rules of the day (1979), BT was barred from manufacturing, selling or supplying PBXs of more than 200 extensions. Digital (PCM-based) PBXs were just starting to come into the marketplace with the Plessey PDX (a licensed version of the ROLM CBX) and the GEC SL1 (a licensed version of the Northern Telecom SL1). It was recognised that corporate customers would wish to network these systems across the country. At the time, 'CAS' inter node signaling was slow and inter-register signaling MF5, developed from PSTN signalling protocols, was complex and would not support sufficient features.The support for DPNSS as BT's own signaling protocol also <b>differentiated</b> BT's private <b>circuit’s</b> services from those of its emerging rival Mercury Communications.DPNSS was an active (and successful) collaboration between PBX manufacturers and BT which started relatively slowly (BT & Plessey) but quickly snowballed with MITEL, GEC, Ericsson, Philips and eventually Nortel all joining to create a powerful and feature rich protocol.BT and some of the UK manufacturers championed DPNSS into ECMA and CCITT (ITU) but it was eventually deprecated by the standards bodies in favour of Q931 and QSig. Nevertheless, the elegance of the protocol and its compatibility with PBX features ensured the adoption DPNSS actually grew in Europe, compared to the much slower take-up of Qsig.There were also attempts (during 1984) to take DPNSS into North America. Unfortunately the structures for the creation of standards in North America seemed to prevent manufacturer collaboration as a route forward and the ANSI standards body was not interested in creating PBX interworking standards.Version 1 of BTNR188 (DPNSS) was issued in 1983; the last version of DPNSS to be released 6 in 1995 included compatibility with ISDN features released in V5. A lightweight version of DPNSS 'APNSS' {{was developed}} using analogue trunks (Sometimes compressed) and a modem to support D channel signalling.|$|R
