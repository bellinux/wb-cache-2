5|$|The 20S {{proteasome}} is both ubiquitous and <b>essential</b> <b>in</b> eukaryotes. Some prokaryotes, {{including many}} archaea and the bacterial order Actinomycetales also share homologs of the 20S proteasome, whereas most bacteria possess heat shock genes hslV and hslU, whose gene products are a multimeric protease {{arranged in a}} two-layered ring and an ATPase. The hslV protein has been hypothesized to resemble the likely ancestor of the 20S proteasome. In general, HslV is not <b>essential</b> <b>in</b> bacteria, and not all bacteria possess it, whereas some protists possess both the 20S and the hslV systems. Many bacteria also possess other homologs of the proteasome and an associated ATPase, most notably ClpP and ClpX. This redundancy explains why the HslUV system is not essential.|$|E
5|$|After the {{constitutional}} revolution in 1821, the Austrian Empire made political manouvres to exclude Carlo Alberto from the succession line, in hope to substitute him with Francesco IV d'Asburgo-Este. Paulucci met, {{during one of}} his Italian licence periods, Carlo Felice in Turin, and resolved to do whatever he can to help him. Paulucci's later efforts at the Russian court were indeed <b>essential</b> <b>in</b> stopping the Austrian ambitions at the Verona's congress. Memoring these good services, the King Carlo Felice invited Paulucci in Piedmont in 1829, and the two started a close friendship.|$|E
5|$|As First Sea Lord, Battenberg was {{responsible}} to the First Lord for {{the readiness of}} the fleet and the preparation of naval strategy, {{as well as the}} development of a scheme for state insurance of merchant vessels in times of war, which was to prove <b>essential</b> <b>in</b> preventing prohibitive insurance rates that would have stifled British trade.|$|E

5|$|Bromine has {{sometimes}} been considered to be possibly <b>essential</b> <b>in</b> humans, but this is supported by only limited circumstantial evidence, and no clear biological role. As a pharmaceutical, the simple bromide ion (Br−) has inhibitory effects on the central nervous system, and bromide salts were once a major medical sedative, before replacement by shorter-acting drugs. They retain niche uses as antiepileptics.|$|E
5|$|Copper is <b>essential</b> <b>in</b> the aerobic {{respiration}} of all eukaryotes. In mitochondria, {{it is found}} in cytochrome c oxidase, which is the last protein in oxidative phosphorylation. Cytochrome c oxidase is the protein that binds the O2 between a copper and an iron; the protein transfers 8 electrons to the O2 molecule to reduce it to two molecules of water.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of the de novo pathway, the salvage reactions are <b>essential</b> <b>in</b> humans; a lack of niacin in the diet causes the vitamin deficiency disease pellagra. This high requirement for NAD results from the constant consumption of the coenzyme in reactions such as posttranslational modifications, since the cycling of NAD between oxidized and reduced forms in redox reactions does not change the overall levels of the coenzyme.|$|E

5|$|Extracts of {{the fruit}} body of Ramaria {{botrytis}} {{have been shown to}} favorably influence the growth and development of HeLa cells grown in tissue culture. The mushroom contains nicotianamine, an ACE inhibitor (angiotensin-converting enzyme). Nicotianamine is a metal-chelating compound <b>essential</b> <b>in</b> iron metabolism and utilization in plants. Several sterols have been isolated from the fruit bodies, 5α,6α-epoxy-3β-hydroxy-(22E)-ergosta-8(14),22-dien-7-one, ergosterol peroxide, cerevisterol, and 9α-hydroxycerevisterol, in addition to the previously unknown ceramide (2S,2R,3R,4E,8E)-N-2'-hydroxyoctadecanoyl-2-amino-9-methyl-4,8-heptade-cadiene-1,3-diol.|$|E
5|$|From 1951 to 1963, Stevens {{served as}} {{vice-president}} of the Lucy Stone League, though she struggled with maintaining militancy. Stevens was not anti-male, rather pro-female. She {{did not follow}} a belief that for women to succeed, men had to be omitted; rather, she believed that collaboration with men was <b>essential.</b> <b>In</b> her last years, Stevens supported the establishment of feminist studies as a legitimate field of academic inquiry in American universities and tried to establish a Lucy Stone Chair of Feminism at Radcliffe College.|$|E
5|$|In biology, manganese(II) ions {{function}} as cofactors {{for a large}} variety of enzymes with many functions. Manganese enzymes are particularly <b>essential</b> <b>in</b> detoxification of superoxide free radicals in organisms that must deal with elemental oxygen. Manganese also functions in the oxygen-evolving complex of photosynthetic plants. While the element is a required trace mineral for all known living organisms, it also acts as a neurotoxin in larger amounts. Especially through inhalation, it can cause manganism, a condition in mammals leading to neurological damage that is sometimes irreversible.|$|E

5|$|In {{her efforts}} {{to be the perfect}} wife, she was often given an eye for trying too hard, but at the same time, she became a subject of envy for fellow politicians' wives. Imelda learned how to get people's {{attention}} and to focus it on both her and her husband. She reached out to every single person who was seen as <b>essential</b> <b>in</b> Marcos's campaign. Her efforts were not original, but extraordinary. No other politicians' wives shook hands with all the delegates, visited their homes, genuinely understood the concerns they had, aside from Imelda. She bombarded them with gifts when necessary.|$|E
5|$|Mathematics were <b>essential</b> <b>in</b> {{drafting}} the astronomical calendar, a lunisolar calendar that used the Sun and Moon as time-markers throughout the year. Use {{of the ancient}} Sifen calendar (古四分曆), which measured the tropical year at 3651⁄4 days, was replaced in 104 BC with the Taichu calendar (太初曆) that measured the tropical year at 365385⁄1539 days and the lunar month at 2943⁄81 days. However, Emperor Zhang later reinstated the Sifen calendar.|$|E
5|$|Most pre-war {{officers}} {{came from}} families with military connections, the gentry or the peerage; {{a public school}} education was almost <b>essential.</b> <b>In</b> 1913, about 2% of regular officers had been promoted from the ranks. The officer corps, during the war, consisted of regular officers from the peacetime army, officers who had been granted permanent commissions during the war, officers who had been granted temporary commissions {{for the duration of}} the war, territorial army officers commissioned during peacetime, officers commissioned from the ranks of the pre-war regular and territorial army and temporary officers commissioned from the ranks {{for the duration of the}} war alone.|$|E

5|$|Ongoing {{problems}} with avionics systems were {{addressed in the}} Jolly Well program, completed in 1964, which improved components of the AN/ASQ-38 bombing navigational computer and the terrain computer. The MADREC (Malfunction Detection and Recording) upgrade fitted to most aircraft by 1965 could detect failures in avionics and weapons computer systems, and was <b>essential</b> <b>in</b> monitoring the Hound Dog missiles. The electronic countermeasures capability of the B-52 was expanded with Rivet Rambler (1971) and Rivet Ace (1973).|$|E
5|$|Partner {{communication}} is <b>essential</b> <b>in</b> a good defense. When one partner is under attack, the other partner {{should be aware}} of which pieces hurt most. Sitting strategies might be necessary, and it is therefore important to play the defense fast. Accepting a sacrifice can be lethal. On the other hand, it results in the attacker having a piece less to play with, with the defender's partner having a piece more. Sacrifices therefore give the partner of the defender an opportunity to take initiative.|$|E
