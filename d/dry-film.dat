40|$|Abstract. The {{production}} of automotive body parts and panels {{is a very}} complex process, starting with the raw materials and ending in the paint shop. Due to the fact that aluminium sheet metal has to be lubricated before forming, all of the following processes have to be considered. Lubricants, such as oils, <b>dry-film</b> lubricants or recently introduced hotmelts have to protect the material’s surface, reduce friction whilst drawing the panels and should not compromise further treatments [1]. Different types of lubricants show different characteristics. This difference is especially noticeable when comparing liquid and <b>dry-film</b> lubricants. As <b>dry-film</b> lubricants do not run off the blanks ’ surface and are distributed homogeneously, they show different tribological properties compared to conventional liquid lubricants. The effect on friction of aluminium sheet metal is shown through several basic experiments [2, 3]. In addition, the paper shows the effect of further operations within the production chain. The advantages and disadvantages not only for drawing, but also for assembly lines and the painting process are described in this paper. Assembly issues are carried out on stability testings of riveted and clinched assemblies. These trials show how the assembly process is affected by different proceedings. The fact that every car body has to be completely free of grease before painting, signifies the necessity to get lubrication off the car body’s surface before painting. The interactions between lubrication and paint shop are shown on typical process parameters. Most typical characteristics considering bonding and riveting were tested out on a hood assembly of the current BMW 7 -series. In addition to that, experiences made in the press shop at BMW’s Dingolfing plant were figured out and carried over to a long-term strategy of pre-lubrication of aluminium sheet metal. This includes adhesive compatibility as well as the above mentioned assembly process...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a chip-level post-complementary {{metal oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS) processing technique for 3 -D integration and through-silicon-via (TSV) fabrication. The proposed technique is based on <b>dry-film</b> lithography, which is a low-cost and simple alternative to spin-coated resist. Unlike conventional photolithography methods, the technique allows resist patterning on very high topography, and therefore chip-level photolithography can be done without using any wafer reconstitution approach. Moreover, this paper proposes a via sidewall passivation method which eliminates dielectric etching {{at the bottom of}} the via and simplifies the whole integration process. In this paper, two 50 -μm-thick chips were post-processed, aligned, bonded, and connected by Cu TSVs, which have parylene sidewall passivation. Daisy-chain resistance measurements show 0. 5 - resistance on average for 60 -μm-diameter TSVs, with a yield of more than 99 % for 1280 TSVs from five different chip stacks. Subsequently, the techniques were applied to CMOS microprocessor stacking as a test vehicle. Die-level post-CMOS processing for 40 -μm-diameter via etching, redistribution layer patterning, and chip-to-chip bonding were successfully demonstrated with the real chips.

40|$|The {{demands of}} higher routing density on wafer level {{are driven by}} multi-chip {{integrated}} fan-out packages and high I/O CSPs. New technologies and materials are necessary to generate lines and spaces down to 2 μm. Multi-metal layers are necessary for the higher wiring effort on panel level packaging (PLP) for example to contact dies which are embedded together. This places higher demands on the mechanical properties of the materials that are used for the redistribution layer. This paper presents a new excimer laser-enabled dual damascene process for ultra-fine routing for BEOL which was developed in a joint project with SUSS MicroTec. In the project, various materials e. g. low temperature cure polyimide, BCB and <b>dry-film</b> ABF materials were structured by using an excimer laser stepper with a reticle mask to pattern feature sizes below 4 μm with a high throughput. Micro-vias with a diameter below 5 μm were ablated with an aspect ratios up to 4 which is exceeding the photolithographic resolution limits of the established photosensitive thin-film polymers. The laser structuring allows the usage of innovative dielectric materials for WLPs/PLPs with optimized mechanical and electrical parameters, for example polymers with inorganic fillers like <b>dry-film</b> ABF material. Also, the ablations depth per laser pulse was investigated. The ablated lines and micro-vias were metallized by applying a galvanic process and CMP. The stepper-like system allows a sub-micron alignment accuracy with no need of a capture pad in the redistribution layers. Test multi-layer structures have been designed and fabricated with lines and spaces below 10 μm to demonstrate the dense routing capability with an excellent reliability which was verified by air-to-air thermal cycling (from - 55 °C up to 125 °C) ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. We {{evaluated}} the Macroflux microprojection array patch technology as a novel system for intracutaneous delivery of protein antigens. Methods. Macroflux microprojection array systems (330 -m micro-projection length, 190 microprojections/cm 2, 1 - and 2 -cm 2 area) were {{coated with a}} model protein antigen, ovalbumin (OVA), to produce a <b>dry-film</b> coating. After system application, microprojection penetra-tion depth, OVA delivery, and comparative immune responses were evaluated in a hairless guinea pig model. Results. Macroflux microprojections penetrated into hairless guinea pig skin at an average depth of 100 m with no projections deeper than 300 m. Doses of 1 to 80 g of OVA were delivered via 1 - or 2 -cm 2 systems by varying the coating solution concentration and wearing time. Delivery rates were as high as 20 g in 5 s. In a prime and boost dose immune response study, OVA-coated Macroflux was most comparable to equivalent doses injected intradermally. Higher antibody titers were observed when OVA was administered with the microprojection array or intradermally at low doses (1 and 5 g). Macroflux administration at 1 - and 5 -g doses gave immune responses up to 50 -fold greater than that observed after the same subcutaneous or intramuscular dose. Dry coating an adjuvant, glu-cosaminyl muramyl dipeptide, with OVA on the Macroflux resulted in augmented antibody responses. Conclusions. Macroflux skin patch technology provides rapid and reproducible intracutaneous administration of dry-coated antigen. The depth of skin penetration targets skin immune cells; the quantity of antigen delivered can be controlled by formulation, patch wearing time, and system size. This novel needle-free patch technology may ultimately have broad applications {{for a wide variety}} of therapeutic vaccines to improve efficacy and convenience of use.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel {{approach}} to enhance the sensitivity of microfluidic biosensor platforms with self-assembled magnetic bead chains. An adjustable, more than 5 -fold sensitivity enhancement is achieved by introducing a magnetic field gradient along a microfluidic channel {{by means of a}} soft-magnetic lattice with a 350 μm spacing. The alternating magnetic field induces the self-assembly of the magnetic beads in chains or clusters and thus improves the perfusion and active contact between the analyte and the beads. The soft-magnetic lattices can be applied independent of the channel geometry or chip material to any microfluidic biosensing platform. At the same time, the bead-based approach achieves chip reusability and shortened measurement times.

40|$|A {{number of}} ceramic {{coatings}} of different compositions containing lead monoxide (PbO) were studied {{to determine their}} relative merits as <b>dry-film</b> lubricants. Lead monoxide {{is known to be}} an effective solid lubricant at elevated temperatures, and this oxide was the main component in all compositions studied. Friction and wear properties were determined at temperatures from 750 to 1250 F, at a sliding velocity of 430 feet per minute, and at a normal load of 1 kilogram. In all of the coatings, PbO was the component primarily responsible for the lubricating properties. Oxides other than PbO had an indirect effect on lubrication by influencing such properties as adhesion, hardness, vitrifying or glaze-forming tendency, melting or softening point, and chemical stability of the coatings. Notable among these oxides were magnetite (Fe 3 O 4.), which had generally a beneficial influence on ceramic- to-metal adhesion, and silica (SiO 2), which inhibited the oxidation of PbO and enhanced the tendency for glaze formation on the sliding surfaces. Several of the compositions studied provided protection against metal-to-metal adhesive wear, galling, or seizure at test temperatures from 750 to 1250 F.

Inductive heating of thc foil releases {approx} 45 % of the implanted atoms into a MOT that uses large diameter beams and a <b>dry-film</b> coating to capture 3 % of the released vapor.

40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{study the}} impact of solvent evaporation on the dynamics of isothermal phase separation of ternary polymer solutions in thin films. In the early stages we obtain a spinodal length scale that decreases with time {{under the influence of}} ongoing evaporation. After that rapid demixing occurs at a well-defined lag time, a morphology emerges of which the compositions of the coexisting phases rapidly approach the binodal values. We find that the type of morphology, which can be either bicontinuous or dispersed, strongly depends on the evaporation rate if the solubility of the two solutes in the common solvent differs. We derive expressions that relate both the lag time and length scale characterizing the emerging morphology to all relevant physical parameters. These include the tracer diffusivities, the interaction parameters, the degrees of polymerization, the blend composition, and the evaporation rate. In agreement with our numerical results, we find the latter to scale with a one-sixth power of the evaporation rate. Following the lag time, a new length scale appears that increases with time due to coarsening. If evaporation is sufficiently slow, this length increases with the conventional one-third power of time. For rapid evaporation deviations from that may occur, especially if the solvent compatibility of the solutes differ. Our model calculations suggest that the characteristic features of the final <b>dry-film</b> morphology is dictated by the quench depth as well as the time available for coarsening, which are both determined by the rate of evaporation...|$|E
40|$|In this work, a {{low cost}} solution-based method for the {{deposition}} of uniform Cu-In-Ga layers compatible with roll-to-roll processing is described. As ink system we use metal carboxylates dissolved {{in a mixture}} of a nitrogen containing base and an alcohol. This solution can be coated homogeneously under inert atmosphere using a doctor blade technique. With this method and appropriate precursor concentrations, crack-free metal layers with <b>dry-film</b> thicknesses of more than 700 nm can be deposited in one fast step. For the controlled film formation during the drying of the solvents a flow channel has been used to improve the evaporative mass transport and the convective gas flows of any unwanted organic species. Due to the absence of organic binders with high molecular weight, this step allows the formation of virtually pure metal layers. Elementary analyses of the dried thin films reveal less than 5 wt% of carbon residues at 200 °C. In situ X-ray diffraction data of the drying step show the formation of Cu-In-Ga alloys. The subsequent processing of Cu(In,Ga) Se 2 chalcopyrites with evaporated elemental selenium takes place in a separate tube oven under inert atmosphere. Photoelectric measurements of cells with CdS buffer and ZnO window layer reveal a short-circuit current of 29 mA/cm 2, an open-circuit voltage of 533 mV, and a fill factor of 0. 69 under standard conditions.

The technique is based on the standard lithographic process commonly used for pattern transfer onto a flat substrate. The essence of the technology presented here is the lithographic fabrication of a planar grating structure on top of a flexible membrane on a glass or silicon wafer and the subsequent deformation of the membrane using a master shape. For the validation of the proposed technology we fabricated several reflection concave diffraction gratings with the f-numbers varying from 2 to 3. 8 and a diameter in the 4 – 7 mm range. A glass wafer with circular holes was laminated by <b>dry-film</b> resist to form the membranes.

The pump is entirely made of polymer materials barring the magnet and copper coils used for electromagnetic actuation. The fabrication is carried out using widely available microelectronic packaging machinery and techniques. Therefore, the fabrication of the pump is straightforward and inexpensive. Two types of prototypes are designed and built. One consists of copper coils that are etched on an epoxy plate and the other has wound insulated wire of 90 µm diameter {{to serve as a}} coil. The overall size of the first pump is 25 mm × 25 mm × 3. 6 mm including the 3. 1 mm-thick NdFeB magnet of diameter 12 mm.

40|$|To keep {{a painted}} facade {{protected}} from mold and algae, anti-growth agents are mixed in the coating. These biocides are small molecules {{with a high}} diffusivity inside the soft polymeric coating matrix resulting in a premature loss of protection. A promising improvement {{can be achieved by}} encapsulation of the biocide in micro-sized containers and thereby reducing the release rate from the coating. In this study, the biocide 2 -n-octyl- 4 -isothiazolin- 3 -one (OIT) has been encapsulated by various formulation routes and the release has been studied with regard to different conditions. It was found that an exceptionally low interfacial tension between OIT and water practically prevents any formulation of core-shell particles. However, polymeric monoliths of OIT and poly(methyl methacrylate) could be formulated by the internal phase separation method. OIT release studies from these microspheres revealed formulation-dependent microscopic porosity where the chosen evaporation path of volatile solvent significantly alters the diffusion coefficient of the biocide in the microsphere. Dense microstructure with low diffusivity was given when the poly(methyl methacrylate) was provided time or heat for complete polymer relaxation. The microscopic porosity was evaluated within a framework of applied diffusion models to the experimental data. In an applied perspective, microspheres could offer a value for sustained release of OIT from coatings. In this work, we found a considerable decrease in release rate from <b>dry-film</b> coatings with encapsulated OIT compared to freely dispersed OIT. In addition, macroscopic porosity in the coating, i. e. the porosity in the binder material, was proven to be crucial for the diffusivity. It was shown that macroscopic porosity heavily depends on the drying time of the coating where longer drying times of several weeks gave a substantial decrease in macroscopic porosity and release rate of OIT...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the years}} {{several types of}} biocide-free {{antifouling}} paints have entered the market. The prohibition of biocidal antifouling paints in special areas of some European countries such as Sweden, Denmark and Germany has favoured the introduction of these paints to the market. Several types of biocide-free antifouling paints were subjected to bioassays and selected chemical analysis of leachate and incorporated substances. Both non-eroding coatings (silicones, fibre coats, epoxies, polyurethane, polyvinyl) and eroding coatings (SPCs, ablative) were tested to exclude the presence of active biocides and dangerous compounds. The paints were subjected to the luminescent bacteria test and the cypris larvae settlement assay, the latter delivering information on toxicity {{as well as on}} efficacy. The following chemical analyses of selected compounds of <b>dry-film</b> were performed:leaching-rate of organotin compounds from silicones and of nonylphenol and bisphenol A from epoxy and vinyl based coatings,concentration and leaching rate of selected organic compounds in polyurethane,concentration of heavy metals in eroding coatings. The results of the bioassays indicated that none of the coatings analysed contained leachable biocides. Nevertheless, some products contained or leached dangerous compounds. The analyses revealed leaching of nonylphenol (up to 74. 7 ng/cm 2 /d after 48 h) and bisphenol A (up to 2. 77 ng/cm 2 /d after 24 h) from epoxy resins used as substitutes for antifouling paints. The heavy metal, zinc, was measured in dry paint film in quantities up to 576 000 ppm in erodable coatings, not incorporated as a biocide but to control the rate of erosion. Values for TBT in silicone elutriates were mostly below the detection limit of 0. 005 mg/kg. Values for DBT ranged between < 0. 005 and 6. 28 mg/kg, deriving from catalysts used as curing agents.

The geometry of the compliant interconnect, its dimensions, and the material and processes used for fabricating the interconnect influence its mechanical and electrical characteristics, fabrication and assembly yield, thermo-mechanical and drop-impact reliability, and cost of fabrication. Although studies have examined various compliant interconnect designs, a multi-objective and multi-physics design optimization of the compliant interconnect has not been adequately pursued and implemented in prototypes. The first objective of this thesis {{is to develop a}} second-level multi-path compliant interconnect for microelectronic systems by performing compliance analysis and multi-physics design optimization using analytical and numerical models; The second objective of this thesis is to develop <b>dry-film</b> based sequential processes to fabricate such compliant interconnects on a silicon wafer, and to assemble singulated silicon substrates on organic printed circuit boards. In particular, in this work, the fabricated interconnects form a 45 × 45 array on the 18 mm × 18 mm silicon substrate. Several variations of the interconnects have been fabricated with the arcuate beam having a width of 10, 15, and 20 µm on a footprint of 280 µm, and with a pitch of 400 µm. The third objective of this work is to experimentally demonstrate the thermal cycling reliability of the assemblies, and to validate the results from numerical models. The fourth objective is to experimentally demonstrate that compliant interconnects can effectively isolate the silicon substrate from the board under drop impact conditions, and to determine the reliability of the interconnects under drop impact conditions. It is seen that the compliant interconnects are able to isolate the silicon substrate from the board, and the board-to-substrate strain ratios are 21. 55, 9. 53 and 7. 01 for compliant interconnects with arcuate beam width equal to 10 μm, 15 μm and 20 μm, respectively, compared to 2. 46 for solder ball interconnects. The experimental drop impact results are used for validating the drop-impact simulation predictions. Overall, by combining cleanroom fabrication, assembly, thermal cycling and drop-impact testing with analytical and numerical models as well as design optimization, this work provides a comprehensive insight into the development of multi-path copper structures as second-level microsystem interconnects.
