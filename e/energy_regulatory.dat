5|$|In 1961, an {{overwhelming}} majority of voters in the TID and MID service areas and San Francisco approved bond issues to finance {{the construction of a new}} dam. The irrigation districts hoped to complete the dam by 1966, but concerns that the dam would further impact decreasing populations of king salmon in the Tuolumne put a temporary stop to the project. In fact, it was not until that year that the Federal Power Commission (now Federal <b>Energy</b> <b>Regulatory</b> Commission) licensed the irrigation districts to go ahead on New Don Pedro.|$|E
5|$|The {{power station}} is {{regulated}} by the Federal <b>Energy</b> <b>Regulatory</b> Commission (FERC), under the Federal Power Act, with the current license issued in 1992 and set to expire in 2022. The first license was granted by the FERC's predecessor, the Federal Power Commission in 1939. When the reservoir's elevation exceeds , control of the dam's discharges are transferred to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) who manage flood control in the larger basin. By federal regulation, the GRDA and the Corps of Engineers often coordinate discharges and reservoir levels.|$|E

25|$|Fossil fuel {{regulations}} {{are part of}} the energy policy in the United States and have gained major significance with the strong dependence on fossil fuel based <b>energy.</b> <b>Regulatory</b> processes are established at the federal and state level due to the immense economic, socio-political and environmental impact of fossil fuel extraction and production. Over 80% of the United States' energy comes from fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas, and oil. The Bush administration was marked by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which provided a monetary incentive for renewable energy adoption and addressed the issue of climate change.

40|$|This paper evaluates {{energy tax}} {{reform in the}} Netherlands between 1988 and 2002 from a climate change perspective. A tax on fuels and the {{so-called}} <b>regulatory</b> <b>energy</b> tax since 1996 are examples of indirect and non-uniform taxation of emissions. The overall tax base and rate structure corroborates recent theoretical findings that heterogeneity in production processes and transaction costs may justify optimal departures from the Pigovian corrective tax rule. Surprisingly, the Dutch revenue-raising tax matches the (modified) Pigovian policy prescription rather well, whereas the <b>regulatory</b> <b>energy</b> tax mainly follows the revenue raising Ramsey logic. Further improvements of the energy tax structure are also discussed, such as targeting the energy tax base and linking the tax rate more precisely to fuel characteristics.
