40|$|More than ever, {{efficiency}} and quality are key words in modern industry. This situation enhances {{the importance of}} quality control and creates a great demand for cheap and reliable automatic inspection systems. Taking into account these facts {{and the demand for}} systems able to inspect the final shape of machined parts, we decided to investigate the viability of automatic model-based inspection of mechanical parts using the dense range data produced by laser stripers. Given a part to be inspected and a corresponding model of the part stored in the model data base, the first step of inspecting the part is the acquisition of data corresponding to the part, in our case this means the acquisition of a range image of it. In {{order to be able to}} compare the part image and its stored model, it is necessary to align the model with the range image of the part. This process, called registration, corresponds to finding the rigid transformation that superposes model and image. After the image and model are registered, the actual inspection uses the range image to verify if all the features predicted in the model are present and have the right pose and dimensions. Therefore, besides the acquisition of range images, the inspection of machined parts involves three main issues: modelling, registration and inspection diagnosis. The application, for inspection purposes, of the main representational schemes for modelling solid objects is discussed and it is suggested the use of EDT models (see [Zeid 91]). A particular implementation of EDT models is presented. A novel approach for the verification of tolerances during the inspection is proposed. The approach allows not only the inspection of the most common tolerances described in the tolerancing standards, but also the <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerances</b> defined according to Requicha's theory of tolerancing (see [Requicha 83]). A model of the sensitivity and reliability of the inspection process based on the modelling of the errors during the inspection process is also proposed. The importance of the accuracy of the registration in different inspections tasks is discussed. A modified version of the ICP algorithm (see [Besl &; McKay 92]) for the registration of sculptured surfaces is proposed. The maximum accuracy of the ICP algorithm, as a function of the sensor errors and the number of matched points, is determined. A novel method for the measurement and reconstruction of waviness errors on sculp¬ tured surfaces is proposed. The method makes use of the 2 D Discrete Fourier Transform for the detection and reconstruction of the waviness error. A model of the sensitivity and reliability of the method is proposed. The application of the methods proposed is illustrated using synthetic and real range image...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues for}} a closer <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> how <b>tolerance</b> and {{politics}} interact. Within geography and beyond there is rising concern about post-political situations, whereby potential disagreements are foreclosed and situated beyond the remit of political debate. This is conceptualised {{as a process of}} de-politicisation that operates ‘much more effectively’than alternative ways in which politics can be and has been disavowed (Žižek, 1999 : 198). While Žižek associates liberal tolerance with the post-political condition, however, theories <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> are at odds over whether it represents an everyday enactment of the political. Although some authors have indeed associated tolerance with a depoliticising tendency (Brown, 2006), others insist that certain types <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> are capable <b>of</b> nurturing simultaneous recognition and disagreement, which directly contradicts the conditions of post-politics (Forst, 2003). We therefore ask, contra Žižek, whether certain forms <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> can be an antidote to the post-political practice of foreclosing politics, and offer a set of considerations pertinent to the geographical analysis of this issue. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|AbstractImplementing {{efficient}} inspection policies is much {{important for}} the organizations to reduce quality related costs. In this paper, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed to determine the optimal inspection policy in serial multi-stage processes. The policy consists of three decision parameters to be optimized; i. e. the stages in which <b>inspection</b> occurs, <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspection,</b> and size <b>of</b> sample to inspect. Total inspection cost is adopted as the performance measure of the algorithm. A numerical example is investigated in two phases, i. e. fixed sample size and sample size as a decision parameter, to ensure the practicality {{and validity of the}} proposed PSO algorithm.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with a vast industrial problem: the <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> physical components and subsystems for checking their conformance to dimensional and geometric tolerance specifications. Although a number of non contact optical devices are being currently developed for such a task, Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMM) are still universally adopted thanks to their superiority in terms of accuracy in the measurement of point coordinates. However, their unsurpassed metrological quality for this basic operation is counterbalanced by a fundamental problem that is plaguing practitioners in the sector of industrial metrology. The problem is usually referred to as methods divergence and can be stated as follows. On one hand, the machines probe the part surface point-wise and economic constraints force the point sample to be small. On the other end, geometric errors, as defined by tolerance standards, depend heavily on extreme values of the form deviations over the related surface so that a full-field inspection is virtually required. For example, straightness error is the minimum distance between two parallel lines enclosing the actual feature. Thus extreme points {{are more important than}} the others in determining the straightness error. This problem, translated in statistical terms, means using a small sample of form deviations to make inference on a quantity dependent on extreme values of the population, thereby unlikely to be in the sample. Thus sample-based evaluation of geometric errors is naturally prone to be substantially biased and uncertain, especially when the surfaces exhibit systematic form deviations. In spite of this, common practice in industry is to probe very few points according to very simple sampling strategy (uniform, random, stratified). The software packages sold with the machines contain algorithms of computational geometry which are selected by purely economic criteria (easy to implement, fast to compute) regardless of their implications on measurement quality. Moreover, user awareness of the importance of evaluating measurement uncertainty in the <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> geometric <b>tolerances</b> is exceedingly limited. This is no wonder if we consider that the ISO committees have been working for several years on different four methods for uncertainty evaluation in CMM measurement tasks (ISO 15530 family) and still now only one standard has been officially delivered (ISO 15530 - 3, march 2004).
