5|$|On December 3, 2012 the {{government}} became a caretaker government after Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovich accepted {{the resignation of}} prime minister Mykola Azarov and his government following the 28 October 2012 parliamentary election. A number of <b>government</b> <b>members,</b> including Prime Minister Azarov, were elected to parliament in that election.

5|$|The most {{important}} and high profile of the committees are the pairs of standing committees. These each have six members. The chairman of each legislation committee is chosen from amongst the <b>government</b> <b>members,</b> the deputy chair from amongst non-government members.

Because the chair has a casting vote {{in the event of a}} committee vote being tied, the government effectively controls the legislation committees, while the non-government parties control the references committees.|$|E

5|$|The unity {{government}} suffered a partial collapse in 1995. The continuing violence, along with appointing {{of local government}} officials who were almost exclusively RPF Tutsi, caused serious disagreement between Kagame and senior Hutu <b>government</b> <b>members,</b> including prime minister Faustin Twagiramungu and interior minister Seth Sendashonga. Twagiramungu resigned in August, and Kagame fired Sendashonga and three others the next day. Pasteur Bizimungu remained president but {{the makeup of the}} new government was predominantly RPF Tutsi loyal to Kagame. Twagiramungu and Sendashonga moved abroad to form a new opposition party shortly after leaving the government.|$|E

Later, they were moved to Sigmaringen in Germany, where they acted as a Vichy French government in exile.

25|$|Pakistan {{suffered}} a currency crisis {{when the government}} failed to arrest the 30% fall {{in the value of}} the Pakistani Rupee from ₨. 21 to ₨.30 compared to the United States dollar. Soon economic progress became her top priority but her investment and industrialisation programs faced major setbacks due to conceptions formed by investors based upon her People's Party nationalisation program in the 1970s. By the 1990s, Khan and Bhutto's government had also ultimately lost the currency war with the Indian Rupee which beat the value of Pakistan rupee for the first time in the 1970s. Bhutto's denationalisation program also suffered from many political setbacks, as many of her <b>government</b> <b>members</b> were either directly or indirectly involved with the government corruption in major government-owned industries, and her appointed <b>government</b> <b>members</b> allegedly sabotaged her efforts to privatise the industries.|$|E
