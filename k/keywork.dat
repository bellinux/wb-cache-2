25|$|Sax's patent {{expired in}} 1866; thereafter, {{numerous}} saxophonists and instrument manufacturers implemented their own {{improvements to the}} design and <b>keywork.</b> The first substantial modification was by a French manufacturer who extended the bell slightly and added an extra key to extend the range downwards by one semitone to B. It is suspected that Sax himself may have attempted this modification. This extension is now commonplace in almost all modern designs, along with other minor changes such as added keys for alternate fingerings. Using alternate fingerings allows a player to play faster and more easily. A player may also use alternate fingerings to bend the pitch. Some of the alternate fingerings are good for trilling, scales, and big interval jumps.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the modern bassoon owes {{a great deal to}} the performer, teacher, and {{composer}} Carl Almenräder. Assisted by the German acoustic researcher Gottfried Weber, he developed the 17-key bassoon with a range spanning four octaves. Almenräder's improvements to the bassoon began with an 1823 treatise describing ways of improving intonation, response, and technical ease of playing by augmenting and rearranging the <b>keywork.</b> Subsequent articles further developed his ideas. His employment at Schott gave him the freedom to construct and test instruments according to these new designs, and he published the results in Caecilia, Schott's house journal. Almenräder continued publishing and building instruments until his death in 1846, and Ludwig van Beethoven himself requested one of the newly made instruments after hearing of the papers. In 1831, Almenräder left Schott to start his own factory with a partner, Johann Adam Heckel.|$|E

25|$|The Western concert flute, a {{descendant}} of the medieval German flute, is a transverse treble flute that is closed at the top. An embouchure hole is positioned near the top across and into which the flutist blows. The flute has circular tone holes larger than the finger holes of its baroque predecessors. The size and placement of tone holes, key mechanism, and fingering system used to produce the notes in the flute's range were evolved from 1832 to 1847 by Theobald Boehm and greatly improved the instrument's dynamic range and intonation over its predecessors. With some refinements (and the rare exception of the Kingma system and other custom adapted fingering systems), Western concert flutes typically conform to Boehm's design, known as the Boehm system. Beginner's flutes are made of nickel, silver, or brass that is silver-plated, while professionals use solid silver, gold, and sometimes platinum flutes. There are also modern wooden-bodied flutes usually with silver or gold <b>keywork.</b> The wood is usually African Blackwood.|$|E
500|$|The modern orchestral {{standard}} of using soprano clarinets in B and A {{has to do}} partly {{with the history of}} the instrument and partly with acoustics, aesthetics, and economics. Before about 1800, {{due to the lack of}} airtight pads (see History), practical woodwinds could have only a few keys to control accidentals (notes outside their diatonic home scales). The low (chalumeau) register of the clarinet spans a twelfth (an octave plus a perfect fifth), so the clarinet needs keys/holes to produce all nineteen notes in this range. This involves more <b>keywork</b> than on instruments that [...] "overblow" [...] at the octave—oboes, flutes, bassoons, and saxophones, for example, which need only twelve notes before overblowing. Clarinets with few keys cannot therefore easily play chromatically, limiting any such instrument to a few closely related keys. For example, an eighteenth-century clarinet in C could be played in F, C, and G (and their relative minors) with good intonation, but with progressive difficulty and poorer intonation as the key moved away from this range. In contrast, for octave-overblowing instruments, an instrument in C with few keys could much more readily be played in any key. This problem was overcome by using three clarinets—in A, B, and C—so that early 19th-century music, which rarely strayed into the remote keys (five or six sharps or flats), could be played as follows: music in 5 to 2 sharps (B major to D major concert pitch) on A clarinet (D major to F major for the player), music in 1 sharp to 1 flat (G to F) on C clarinet, and music in 2 flats to 4 flats (B to A) on the B clarinet (C to B for the clarinetist). Difficult key signatures and numerous accidentals were thus largely avoided.|$|E
2500|$|Sax's {{original}} <b>keywork,</b> {{which was}} based on the Triebert system 3 oboe for the left hand and the Boehm clarinet for the right, was simplistic and made playing some legato passages and wide intervals extremely difficult to finger, so numerous developers added extra keys and alternate fingerings to make chromatic playing less difficult. While early saxophones had two separate octave vents to assist in the playing of the upper registers just as modern instruments do, players of Sax's original design had to operate these via two separate octave keys operated by the left thumb. A substantial advancement in saxophone <b>keywork</b> was the development of a method by which the left thumb operates both tone holes with a single octave key, which is now universal on modern saxophones. [...] Further developments were made by Selmer in the 1930s and '40s, including offsetting tone holes and a revamping of the octave key mechanism, beginning with balanced action instruments and continuing through their celebrated Mark VI line. One of the most radical, however temporary, revisions of saxophone <b>keywork</b> was made in the 1950s by M. Houvenaghel of Paris, who completely redeveloped the mechanics of the system to allow a number of notes (C, B, A, G, F and E) to be flattened by a semitone simply by pressing the right middle finger. This enables a chromatic scale to be played over two octaves simply by playing the diatonic scale combined with alternately raising and lowering this one digit. However, this <b>keywork</b> never gained much popularity, and is no longer in use.|$|E

40|$|This chapter sees Utopia as {{at once a}} {{place of}} dreams, a place of the good, and a place which {{is nowhere to be}} found: paradox, ambiguity, and janus-facedness are {{embedded}} in a very modern punning coupling of the good, ‘eu’, and the nonexistent, ‘ou’, made by Thomas More in his Greek neologism ‘utopia’, title of his eponymous book, which was written in Latin (1516). Moored and yet in recent years unmoored from its Eurocentric roots, utopia has become more than a word or a culture-specific term. I argue that the word utopia was coined at a formative moment of European modernity, that the utopian mode crosses cultures, and after a consideration of More’s Utopia then discuss in comparative perspective some <b>keyworks</b> in the utopian mode from South Asia, especially India, written in the colonial period, in the 19 th and 20 th centuries. How do we recognize a utopia in a non-European context: must it have that strong element of irony that we find in More’s foundational work? Is utopia always part of a secularizing impulse, or does religious imagination deserve a major place in our understanding of it? How do we make taxonomical distinctions between pieces of prose fiction that we term utopian, and the many real-life utopian communities that have flourished globally? Is there, that is, a distinction to be made between fictional, ironic imagination in literary texts, and more grounded utopian socio-political movements? In this chapter, I analyze certain strands in utopian thought and writing from South Asia (a region comprising sovereign countries such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka), mainly India, and see how answers may be given.

Sax was also a maker of the then-popular ophicleide, a large conical brass instrument in the bass register with keys similar to a woodwind instrument. His experience with these two instruments allowed him to develop the skills and technologies needed to make the first saxophones. [...] As an outgrowth of his work improving the bass clarinet, [...] Sax began developing an instrument with the projection of a brass instrument and the agility of a woodwind. He wanted it to overblow at the octave, unlike the clarinet, which rises in pitch by a twelfth when overblown.
