5|$|In 504 the Gepids' {{power was}} {{significantly}} {{reduced by the}} Ostrogoths, who cut short their expansion into the Danubian plains. The Gepids restricted themselves to {{the eastern part of}} the Pannonian Basin; this was to form the core of Thurisind's dominions, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> under the previous Gepid kings. By the early 6th century, the Gepid nobility converted to Arian Christianity, while most of the Gepids remained pagans.|$|E
25|$|The Oglethorpe Stormy Petrels led the Tornado {{through three}} {{quarters}} 7–6, threatening to upset Tech <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> last year.

25|$|When Insull's fortune {{started to}} fade, he sold both WENR and WCBN along with W9XR, to the National Broadcasting Company in March 1931.

25|$|Soon {{after the}} {{decision}} in Raich, the Supreme Court vacated a lower court decision in United States v.

25|$|Many Lebanese civilians voluntarily {{joined the}} rescue effort. Especially {{important}} was a Lebanese construction contractor, Rafiq Hariri {{of the firm}} Oger-Liban, who provided heavy construction equipment, e.g., a 40-ton P & H crane, etc., from nearby BIA worksites. Hariri's construction equipment proved vitally necessary in lifting and removing heavy slabs of concrete debris at the barracks site <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been necessary in assisting with clearing debris after the April U.S. Embassy attack.|$|E

25|$|One {{interpretation}} {{of the work is}} that it depicts the rampant prostitution in the Bois de Boulogne, a large park at the western outskirts of Paris, at the time. This prostitution was common knowledge in Paris, but was considered a taboo subject unsuitable for a painting. Indeed, the Bois de Boulogne is to this day known as a pick-up place for prostitutes and illicit sexual activity after dark, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|The constitution, {{adopted in}} 1924, {{established}} a federal {{system of government}} based on a succession of soviets set up in villages, factories, and cities in larger regions. This pyramid of soviets in each constituent republic culminated in the All-Union Congress of Soviets. However, while {{it appeared that the}} congress exercised sovereign power, this body was actually governed by the Communist Party, which in turn was controlled by the Politburo from Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been under the tsars before Peter the Great.|$|E
25|$|In the 1641 Rebellion, the Munster Plantation was {{temporarily}} destroyed, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been during the Nine Years' War. Ten years of warfare {{took place in}} Munster between the planters and their descendants and the native Irish Catholics. But the ethnic/religious divisions were less stark in Munster than in Ulster. Some of the earlier English Planters in Munster had been Roman Catholics and their descendants largely sided with the Irish in the 1640s. Conversely, some Irish noblemen who had converted to Protestantism – notably Earl Inchiquin – sided with the settler community.|$|E

25|$|Treaties {{obtained}} from local chiefs in Africa were not aimed at having them accept their subjugation − superior force did that (<b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> for the chiefs themselves, earlier) − but were solely to impress on rival colonial powers {{that they had}} the means to convince their own populations of the justice of any military action they might have to take to defend their claim to civilize the area, and that was all that mattered. The idea of democracy was spreading in Europe all throughout the nineteenth century, and, increasingly, governments were required to take account of public opinion. Public opinion in Europe could be a powerful motivator of colonial actions, as the Fashoda Incident a few years later demonstrated.|$|E
25|$|Vietnam was a {{significant}} source of difficulties during the Yongle Emperor's reign. In 1406, the emperor responded to several formal petitions from members of the Trần dynasty, however on arrival to Vietnam, both the Trần prince and the accompanying Chinese ambassador were ambushed and killed. In response to this insult, the Yongle Emperor sent two armies led by Zhang Fu and Mu Sheng to conquer Vietnam. As the Ho royal family were all executed, Vietnam was integrated as a province of China, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been up until 939. With the Ho monarch defeated in 1407, the Chinese began a serious and sustained effort to sinicise the population. On 2 December 1407, the Yongle Emperor gave orders to Zhang Fu that innocent Vietnamese were not to be harmed, ordering family members of rebels to be spared such as young males if they themselves were not involved in rebellion. Unfortunately for the Chinese, while their efforts to make Vietnam into a normal province was accepted by the Vietnamese in the Red River delta, it was met with resistance from the frontier population among the Trai (Muong) peoples. Several revolts started against the Chinese rulers. In early 1418, Lê Lợi, who founded the Lê dynasty, started a major rebellion against Ming rule. By the time the Yongle Emperor died in 1424, the Vietnamese rebels under Lê Lợi's leadership had captured nearly the entire province. By 1427, the Xuande Emperor gave up the effort started by his grandfather and formally acknowledged Vietnam's independence on condition they accept vassal status.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{critical}} success, the third season of Parks and Recreation continued to suffer in the Nielsen ratings, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> {{during the second}} season. The average viewership for the 16 episodes of season three were 4.75 million household viewers, a slight increase over season two's 4.68 million average, but lower than season one's average of 5.45 million households. Michael Schur partially attributed the continually low viewership {{to a decline in}} ratings for NBC in general, as well as changing viewer trends due to a large amount of available channels. He added: [...] "I would love it if our ratings went up and up, and we've done {{a pretty good job of}} making our show inviting and friendly, welcoming to new viewers. Other than that, I'm not sure what else we can do. It’s very disconcerting." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{the early}} years of television, there was some measure of {{cooperation}} among the four major U.S. television networks. However, as television grew into a profitable business, an intense rivalry developed between the networks, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> in radio. NBC and CBS competed fiercely for viewers and advertising dollars, a contest neither underfunded DuMont nor ABC could hope to win. According to author Dennis Mazzocco, [...] "NBC tried to make an arrangement with ABC and CBS to destroy the DuMont network." [...] The plan was for NBC and CBS to exclusively offer ABC their most popular series after they had aired on the bigger networks. ABC would become a network of re-runs, but DuMont would be shut out. ABC president Leonard Goldenson rejected NBC executive David Sarnoff's proposal, but [...] "did not report it to the Justice Department".|$|E
500|$|EMI {{delayed the}} release of the album in the UK to June 1969, after the band had come back from the US and set up a proper tour of their home country. By that time, the band had already {{recorded}} and released their third album Deep Purple in the US, and recorded a single with a new line-up. The Book of Taliesyn was the first release by Harvest Records, a new sub-label which EMI executives had devised as an outlet for British underground progressive rock groups. [...] "Kentucky Woman", with [...] "Wring That Neck" [...] as B-side, was the only single released in the UK in December 1968, but it was retired after only six weeks. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> happened with Shades of Deep Purple the year before, both album and single received little promotion and were widely overlooked, selling much less in the UK than overseas.|$|E
500|$|Other major air pollution, {{particularly}} in China, {{has been compared}} to the 1966 smog. Elizabeth M. Lynch, a New York City legal scholar, said that images of visible air pollution in Beijing from 2012 were [...] "gross" [...] but not [...] "that much different from pictures of New York City in the 1950s and 1960s," [...] specifically referring to the 1952, 1962, and 1966 smog events. Lynch wrote that the Chinese government's increased transparency on the issue was an encouraging sign that pollution in China could be regulated and abated <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> in the United States. Similar comparisons between the 1966 smog and Chinese pollution in late 2012 appeared in Business Insider and Slate. USA Today cited the 1966 smog after China issued its first [...] "red alert" [...] air quality warning in December 2015; the same month, an article in The Huffington Post used the 1966 smog to argue that China could follow the United State's model to regulate pollution.|$|E

50|$|Harris {{criticizes the}} tactics of secularists like Chris Mooney, who argue that science is not {{fundamentally}} (and certainly not superficially) in conflict with religion. Harris sees this as a very serious disagreement, that patronizingly attempts to pacify more devout theists. Harris claims that societies can move away from deep dependence on religion <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> from witchcraft, which he says was once <b>just</b> <b>as</b> deeply ingrained.|$|R

500|$|Mau {{first visited}} Hawaii in 1973, and McCoy {{introduced}} him to Ben Finney. Later, Finney suggested to the Polynesian Voyaging Society that they should try to recruit Mau for their Hōkūle‘a project, since no Hawaiian traditional navigators remained. The project goal was {{to test the hypothesis}} that Polynesians made intentional non-instrument voyages across the Pacific. Tevake, a renowned Polynesian navigator, had died in 1970 and only six others were known. Navigators were reluctant to release their sacred knowledge to [...] "outsiders". At the time, Mau was just 41 years old and the youngest navigator out of the group. Mau feared that traditional navigation would die in his own culture, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> in Hawaii. He had tried to teach the young men of Satawal the skills passed on to him, but he was not optimistic. The members of the younger generation were too busy with school and too attracted to Western culture to undertake the rigorous course of study and apprenticeship. Further, Mau's people did not seem to care that traditional navigation was dying and could be lost forever.|$|E
