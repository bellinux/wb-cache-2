40|$|The {{pursuit of}} high Mach number flight {{presents}} several {{challenges to the}} airframe and engine design engineers. Most obvious is the resulting high temperatures encountered as the aircraft approaches Mach 3 and above. The encountered high temperatures and shaft speeds of engines require rethinking {{in the areas of}} material selections, component design and component operating life. In the area of sump compartment sealing, {{one of the most difficult}} sealing applications is the sealing of an engine s rear sump. Normally this sump will need some method of sealing between two rotating shafts. This sealing operation is done with an <b>intershaft</b> <b>seal.</b> The aft sump region also presents an additional design requirement for the <b>intershaft</b> <b>seal.</b> This region has to absorb the engine s thermal growth, which means that in the seal area, axial movement, on the order of 0. 30 in., between the rotating shafts must be tolerated. A new concept or new technology of sealing an intershaft sump configuration is being developed. This concept, called a rotating intershaft brush seal has key attributes that will allow this seal to perform better, in the demanding environment of sealing an aft sump with two rotating shafts, when compared to today s sealing technology of labyrinth and carbon se...|$|E
40|$|The 2007 NASA Seal/Secondary Air System {{workshop}} {{covered the}} following topics: (i) Overview of NASA's new Orion project aimed at {{developing a new}} spacecraft that will fare astronauts to the International Space Station, the Moon, Mars, and beyond; (ii) Overview of NASA's fundamental aeronautics technology project; (iii) Overview of NASA Glenn s seal project aimed at developing advanced seals for NASA's turbomachinery, space, and reentry vehicle needs; (iv) Reviews of NASA prime contractor, vendor, and university advanced sealing concepts, test results, experimental facilities, and numerical predictions; and (v) Reviews of material development programs relevant to advanced seals development. Turbine engine {{studies have shown that}} reducing seal leakage as well as high-pressure turbine (HPT) blade tip clearances will reduce fuel burn, lower emissions, retain exhaust gas temperature margin, and increase range. Turbine seal development topics covered include a method for fast-acting HPT blade tip clearance control, noncontacting low-leakage <b>seals,</b> <b>intershaft</b> <b>seals,</b> and a review of engine seal performance requirements for current and future Army engine platforms...|$|R
40|$|About {{four years}} ago, work was {{completed}} on a 36 inch diameter gas to gas carbon ring seal used to buffer low pressure turbine {{air at the}} rim of the forward outer flowpath on the GE 36 unducted fan (UDF) engine. At about the same time, we were developing a long life counter-rotating <b>intershaft</b> air-oil <b>seal</b> of approximately 7. 6 inch diameter for operation at 800 fps, 800 F, and 50 psid. Although we were successful in meeting most program goals with a split ring seal of the axial bushing type, the seal with the greatest payoff in life and air leakage rates, bearing many features in common with the GE 36 seal, could not be successfully tested because of the structural weakness of the primary seal ring carbon material. This was a split ring seal using a hybrid combination of orifice compensated hydrostatic and shrouded hydrodynamic gas bearings. We are presently working to develop this design in conjunction with high strength materials being developed by Pure Carbon Co. In the area of engine secondary gas flow path-sealing for performance improvement, we are currently working with carbon and all metal face seals. A 15 inch diameter all metal 'aspirating' face seal, using self-acting hydrostatic bearings, was successfully tested to 700 fps, 100 psid, and 1000 F, demonstrating long life at flow reduction of 86 percent compared to a 'best' labyrinth. This seal will be developed through 1400 F, 900 fps, and 350 psid. The seal 'aspirates' closed at about idle speed pressure during engine start and reopens at engine shutdown. A hydraulic thrust balance seal, currently using orifice compensated hydrostatics, is under development. Other aspects of these projects are briefly covered...|$|R
