40|$|Recent {{economic}} {{events have}} created severe budget problems for state governments, and one area seemingly {{affected by this}} fiscal crisis is state funding for higher education. State governments {{have the ability to}} alter funding to higher education mostly through general fund contributions and <b>earmarked</b> <b>revenue.</b> This paper examines trends in state higher education appropriations, with a specific focus on the relationship between these two funding sources. We find that on average, total appropriations have actually increased over the past decade, and moreover, <b>earmarked</b> <b>revenue</b> has constituted an increasing share of higher education funding, while general fund contributions have been declining. Our regression analysis suggests that the magnitude of the fungibility between the two sources is substantial, but somewhat surprisingly, does not differ across recessions and expansions.

40|$|On June 13, 2002 {{the first}} meeting was held of the Regional Arts Task Force, {{assembled}} by the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce. Meetings of the Task Force through 2002 were open to the public, {{and a number of}} special "listening sessions" were held in various locations in the Metro area. The mission of the Task Force is: "To make the Atlanta region a premier center for the arts, and for it to be recognized as such. " The Task Force members unanimously selected an Arts and Culture Vision Statement: "Arts and Culture will be recognized as defining elements of {{the quality of life in}} the Atlanta region. " From its very first meeting the Task Force gave a grade of "C" to Atlanta as an arts center, and claimed that Atlanta is not achieving its full potential. Three "root causes" of the problem were selected as the highest priorities of the Task Force: * A regional vision and strategy for the arts; * A coordinated regional arts leadership; and * A sustained regional funding mechanism. Through the Task Force's deliberations, the questions arose as to whether much could be achieved without stable funding. This Research Atlanta study, sponsored by SunTrust, considers a type of sustained funding mechanism that has been tried in other US cities and metro areas, an <b>earmarked</b> <b>revenue</b> source for the arts. It does not address the questions of a regional vision and strategy, or a coordinated regional arts leadership, although the question of vision, and an articulation of the public interest in the support of the arts, are a critical part of any discussion of funding sources...|$|E
40|$|With the {{globally}} {{increasing interest}} in accountability in central {{government and the}} search for innovative and fruitful forms of its building blocks, such as the state budget, international comparisons are getting much attention. These can have the form of country-to-country studies, as well as global benchmarks such as the OECD’s Best Practices for Budget Transparency, and the IMF’s Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency. While these frameworks provide a good starting point in order to come to a basic definition of what good accountability and transparency on the governmental level could look like, no benchmark produces a measure of budget transparency that allows for a comparison across countries. In 2007 the International Budget Partnership (IBP) created the Open Budget Index (OBI) in order to fill this gap. This is a biannual measurement that assesses public sector budget accountability at the governmental level for countries worldwide. In 2015 a total of 102 countries participated in the most recently published OBI, with a wide global distribution. In spite of this large pool of participants, the Netherlands has not been part of the assessment until now. For the present paper, we did an assessment of the Dutch central government, in order to analyse how the Netherlands would perform in comparison to top-rated countries according to the OBI. Besides, we wanted to assess the strength of the OBI as a statistical and comparative tool for research. Our findings provide a multi-faceted image of the performances: on the one hand the government performs very well internationally (e. g. when it comes to timely approval of the Executive Budget Proposal by the legislature), but on other terrains it performs significantly less (e. g. in relation to the representation of <b>earmarked</b> <b>revenue</b> estimates and auxiliary budgetary instruments). We conclude with possible policy implications for the Dutch governmental context and suggestions for further research...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, state governments have {{experienced}} two recessions (including the recent “Great Recession”) which {{have resulted in}} significant disruptions in state budgets and highlighted the volatility of the personal income tax and general sales tax. Since infrastructure maintenance funding may be particularly vulnerable to budget cuts during recessions, {{it is important to}} identify more stable revenue sources and budgetary institutions. One of the distinguishing characteristics of highway finance in the United States is the heavy use of <b>earmarked</b> <b>revenues</b> linked to highway users. Our key research question is whether an increase in the share of highway funding from <b>earmarked</b> <b>revenues</b> will reduce the volatility of highway budgets. To answer this research question, we have collected extensive data on state highways, state finances, and other socio-politico-economic characteristics of state governments over a 30 -year period, and developed an empirical model drawing from previous research in state and local public finance. We found that <b>earmarking</b> of <b>revenue</b> in state highway funds is significantly related to highway expenditure; however, the relationship is more nuanced than we originally hypothesized. An increase in the share of highway funding from transportation-related revenue sources or an increase in the share of transportation-related revenue from motor fuel taxes are associated with a decrease in volatility of state highway spending. On the other hand, an increase in the share of transportation-related revenue used for highways is associated with an increase in budget volatility. Since the major alternative use of state transportation-related revenue is to fund local roads, this result indicates the importance of examining state-local intergovernmental finance on highway spending volatility in future research...|$|R

This paper extends first-best analysis of development taxes aimed at preserving land at the urban fringe to account for interactions with other distortions within the urban system. By incorporating urban decline at the city core, which in turn, generates negative neighborhood spillover effects and extra pressure for development at the urban fringe, we provide a more complete framework to evaluate {{the efficiency and}} distributional impacts of development taxes. We consider three potential alternative schemes to recycle the revenues: lump sum recycling, <b>earmarked</b> <b>revenues</b> to purchase conservation easements that permanently save open space and <b>earmarked</b> <b>revenues</b> to subsidize a revitalization program at the city core. In this setting, when revenues from the development tax are earmarked to fund a conservation easement there is an additional welfare gain (relative to the lump sum case) because the threat of future conversation of open space is fully eliminated. Similarly, when <b>revenues</b> are <b>earmarked</b> to fund a revitalization program at the city core, there are additional sources of welfare that make this policy preferred relative to the lump-sum recycling scheme. Finally, we also explore the spatial distributional impacts of these three alternative recycling schemes.

5000|$|The {{widespread}} use of public authorities in New York State was pioneered by Robert Moses in the 1950s and 60s.

The public authority model allowed Moses to bypass many of the legal restrictions placed on state agencies, allowing him to expedite development but also allowing him to hide project financing, contracting and operational information from public scrutiny.
