It offers large elemental, chemical and magnetic sensitivities and a myriad of permissible in-situ sample conditions at sub- 50 nm spatial resolution. The highest measured resolution was 20 nm [1], achieved with a 25 nm outermost zone width zone plate at the full-field microscope XM- 1, at the Advanced Light Source (ALS), Berkeley. The zone plate was fabricated using e-beam lithography. As spatial resolution is roughly equal to the outermost zone width of zone plate, zone width reduction has been the center focus of x-ray microscopy. While e-beam lithography has been providing a path to fabricate high resolution zone plates, shrinkage of outer zone width from 25 nm to 20 nm and below, however, was extremely difficult due to fabrication process limitations in dense line fabrication, such as electron scattering, low e-beam resist contrast and development issues.

40|$|The RF {{microsystem}} {{technology is}} believed to introduce a paradigm switch in the wireless revolution. Although only few companies are to date doing successful business with RF-MEMS, and on a case-by-case basis, important issues need yet {{to be addressed in}} order to maximize yield and performance stability and hence, outperform alternative competitive technologies (e. g. ferroelectric, SoS, SOI,…). Namely the behavior instability associated to: 1) internal stresses of the free standing thin layers (metal and/or dielectric) and 2) the mechanical contact degradation, be it ohmic or capacitive, which may occur due to low forces, on small areas, and while handling severe current densities. The investigation and understanding of these complex scenario, has been the core of theoretical and experimental investigations carried out in the framework of the research activity that will be presented here. The reported results encompass activities which go from coupled physics (multiphysics) modeling, to the development of experimental platforms intended to tackles the underlying physics of failure. Several original findings on RF-MEMS reliability in particular with respect to the major failure mechanisms such as dielectric charging, metal contact degradation and thermal induced phenomena have been obtained. The original use of advanced experimental setup (surface scanning microscopy, light interferometer profilometry) has allowed the definition of innovative methodology capable to isolate and separately tackle the different degradation phenomena under arbitrary working conditions. This has finally permitted on the one hand to shed some light on possible optimization (e. g. packaging) conditions, and on the other to explore the limits of microsystem technology down to the nanoscale. At nanoscale indeed many phenomena take place and can be exploited to either enhance conventional functionalities and performances (e. g. miniaturization, speed or frequency) or introduce new ones (e. g. ballistic transport). At nanoscale, moreover, many phenomena exhibit their most interesting properties in the RF spectrum (e. g. micromechanical resonances). Owing to the fact that today’s minimum manufacturable features have sizes comparable with the fundamental technological limits (e. g. surface roughness, metal grain size, …), the next generation of smart systems requires a switching paradigm on how new miniaturized components are conceived and <b>fabricated.</b> In <b>fact</b> endowed by superior electrical and mechanical performances, novel nanostructured materials (e. g. carbon based, as carbon nanotube (CNT) and graphene) may provide an answer to this endeavor. Extensively studied in the DC and in the optical range, the studies engaged in LAAS have been among the first to target microwave and millimiterwave transport properties in carbon-based material paving the way toward RF nanodevices. Preliminary modeling study performed on original test structures have highlighted the possibility to implement novel functionalities such as the coupling between the electromagnetic (RF) and microelectromechanical energy in vibrating CNT (toward the nanoradio) or the high speed detection based on ballistic transport in graphene three-terminal junction (TTJ). At the same time these study have contributed to identify the several challenges still laying ahead such as the development of adequate design and modeling tools (ballistic/diffusive, multiphysics and large scale factor) and practical implementation issues such as the effects of material quality and graphene-metal contact on the electrical transport. These subjects are the focus of presently on-going and future research activities and may represent a cornerstone of future wireless applications from microwave up to the THz range...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA Micromechanical RF ChannelizerbyMehmet AkgulDoctor of Philosophy in Engineering - Electrical Engineering and Computer SciencesUniversity of California, BerkeleyProfessor Clark T. -C. Nguyen, ChairThe power {{consumption}} {{of a radio}} generally goes as the number and strength of the RF signals it must process. In particular, a radio receiver would consume much less power if the signal presented to its electronics contained only the desired signal in a tiny percent bandwidth frequency channel, rather than the typical mix of signals containing unwanted energy outside the desired channel. Unfortunately, a lack of filters capable of selecting single channel bandwidths at RF forces the front-ends of contemporary receivers to accept unwanted signals, and thus, to operate with sub-optimal efficiency. This dissertation focuses on {{the degree to which}} capacitive-gap transduced micromechanical resonators can achieve the aforementioned RF channel-selecting filters. It aims to first show theoretically that with appropriate scaling capacitive-gap transducers are strong enough to meet the needed coupling requirements; and second, to fully detail an architecture and design procedure needed to realize said filters. Finally, this dissertation provides an actual experimentally demonstrated RF channel-select filter designed using the developed procedures and confirming theoretical predictions. Specifically, this dissertation introduces four methods that make possible the design and fabrication of RF channel-select filters. The first of these introduces a small-signal equivalent circuit for parallel-plate capacitive-gap transduced micromechanical resonators that employs negative capacitance to model the dependence of resonance frequency on electrical stiffness in a way that facilitates the analysis of micromechanical circuits loaded with arbitrary electrical impedances. The new circuit model not only correctly predicts the dependence of electrical stiffness on the impedances loading the input and output electrodes of parallel-plate capacitive-gap transduced micromechanical device, but does so in a visually intuitive way that identifies current drive as most appropriate for applications that must be stable against environmental perturbations, such as acceleration or power supply variations. Measurements on <b>fabricated</b> devices in <b>fact</b> confirm predictions by the new model of up to 4 × improvement in frequency stability against DC-bias voltage variations for contour-mode disk resonators as the resistance loading their ports increases. By enhancing circuit visualization, this circuit model makes more obvious the circuit design procedures and topologies most beneficial for certain mechanical circuits, e. g., filters and oscillators. The second method enables simultaneous low motional resistance (Rx 70, 000) at 61 MHz using an improved ALD-partial electrode-to-resonator gap filling technique that reduces the Q-limiting surface losses of previous renditions by adding an alumina pre-coating before ALD of the gap-filling high-k dielectric. This effort increases the Q over the ~ 10, 000 of previous renditions by more than 6 × towards demonstration of the first VHF micromechanical resonators in any material, piezoelectric or not, to meet the simultaneous high Q (> 50, 000) and low motional resistance Rx (8, 800 supplied by polysilicon disk resonators employing for the first time capacitive transducer gaps small enough to generate coupling strengths of Cx/Co ~ 0. 1 %, which is a 6. 1 × improvement over previous efforts. The filter structure utilizes electrical tuning to correct frequency mismatches due to process variations, where a dc tuning voltage of 12. 1 V improves the filter insertion loss by 1. 8 dB and yields the desired equiripple passband shape. An electrical equivalent circuit is presented that captures not only the ideal filter response, but also parasitic non-idealities that create electrical feed-through, where simulation of the derived equivalent circuit matches the measured filter spectrum closely both in-band and out-of-band. The combined 2. 7 dB passband insertion loss and 50 dB stopband rejection of the demonstrated 206 -element 0. 09 % bandwidth 223. 4 -MHz differential micromechanical disk filter represents a landmark for capacitive-gap transduced micromechanical resonator technology. This demonstration proves that the mere introduction of small gaps, on the order of 39 nm, goes a long way towards moving this technology from a research curiosity to practical performance specs commensurate with the needs of actual RF channel-selecting receiver front-ends. It also emphasizes the need for tuning and defensive stress-relieving structural design when percent bandwidths and gaps shrink, all demonstrated by the work herein. Perhaps most encouraging is that the models presented in dissertation used to design the filter and predict its behavior seem to be all be spot on. This means that predictions using these models foretelling 1 -GHz filters with sub- 200 &# 8486; impedances enabled by 20 nm-gaps might soon come true, bringing this technology ever closer to someday realizing the ultra-low power channel-selecting communication front-ends targeted for autonomous set-and-forget sensor networks. Work towards these goals continues...|$|R
