5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} {{have been}} known to hybridize with other <b>dolphin</b> species. Hybrids with Risso's <b>dolphin</b> occur both in the wild and in captivity. The best known is the wolphin, a false killer whale-bottlenose <b>dolphin</b> hybrid. The wolphin is fertile, and two currently live at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii. The first was born in 1985 to a female bottlenose. Wolphins also exist in the wild. In captivity, a bottlenose <b>dolphin</b> and a rough-toothed <b>dolphin</b> hybridized. A common dolphin-bottlenose <b>dolphin</b> hybrid born in captivity lives at SeaWorld California. Other hybrids live in captivity around the world and in the wild, such as a bottlenose dolphin-Atlantic spotted <b>dolphin</b> hybrid.|$|E
5|$|Bottlenose dolphins, {{the genus}} Tursiops, {{are the most}} common members of the family Delphinidae, the family of oceanic <b>dolphin.</b> Recent {{molecular}} studies show the genus contains two species, the common bottlenose <b>dolphin</b> (Tursiops truncatus) and the Indo-Pacific bottlenose <b>dolphin</b> (Tursiops aduncus), instead of one. Research in 2011 revealed a third species, the Burrunan <b>dolphin</b> (Tursiops australis). Bottlenose dolphins inhabit warm and temperate seas worldwide. They live in all oceans except for the Arctic and Antarctic Circle regions.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, Taiji's bid {{to expand}} their school lunch {{programs}} to include <b>dolphin</b> and whale meat brought about much controversy. An estimated 150kg (330lbs) of <b>dolphin</b> meat was served in Taiji school lunches in 2006. In 2009, <b>dolphin</b> meat was taken off school menus because of the contamination. The levels of mercury and methylmercury taken from samples of <b>dolphin</b> and whale meat sold at supermarkets {{most likely to be}} providing the schools' lunch programs was 10 times that advised by the Japanese Health Ministry. The mercury levels were so high that the Okuwa Co. supermarket chain in Japan permanently removed <b>dolphin</b> meat from its shelves.|$|E

5|$|River <b>dolphins</b> {{are a very}} {{widespread}} {{group of}} fully aquatic mammals that reside exclusively in freshwater or brackish water. They are an informal grouping of <b>dolphins,</b> which is a paraphyletic group within the infraorder Cetacea. The river <b>dolphins</b> comprise the extant families Platanistidae (the Indian <b>dolphins),</b> Iniidae (the Amazonian <b>dolphins),</b> and Pontoporiidae (the brackish <b>dolphins).</b> There are five extant species of river <b>dolphins,</b> and two subspecies. River <b>dolphins,</b> alongside other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla, with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago.|$|R
25|$|Several {{species of}} <b>dolphins</b> and small whales also occur {{constantly}} around the peninsula; dusky <b>dolphins</b> and endangered endemic Hector's <b>dolphins</b> form strong {{connections with the}} area while bottlenose <b>dolphins</b> and common <b>dolphins</b> appears less frequently. The outer peninsula just off Taiaroa Head {{is one of three}} main congregating areas for dusky <b>dolphins</b> in New Zealand while the harbor water and the peninsula provides breeding areas and nurseries, and Hector's <b>dolphins</b> frequent the vicinity of the harbour. Orca are also occasionally seen.|$|R
5|$|In Hindu mythology, the Ganges River <b>Dolphin</b> is {{associated}} with Ganga, the deity of the Ganges river.

5|$|After {{leaving the}} Marianas Islands, {{the eye of}} <b>Dolphin</b> became much larger as the storm {{developed}} strong outflow channels, both indicative of further strengthening. On May16, the typhoon began rapid deepening as it reached the western periphery of the ridge, causing it to turn more to the north. At 06:00UTC that day, the JMA estimated peak 10minute winds of 185km/h (115mph). Based on the well-defined structure and Dvorak ratings of T7.0, the JTWC upgraded <b>Dolphin</b> to a super typhoon late on May16 with 1minute winds of 260km/h (160mph). The approaching westerlies turned <b>Dolphin</b> {{to the north and}} northeast on May17 while also imparting unfavorable conditions, causing the eye and the convection to elongate and weaken. By May18, increased wind shear had exposed the circulation as the winds continued to drop. After the convection decreased further, the JTWC discontinued advisories on <b>Dolphin</b> on May19, once <b>Dolphin</b> was beginning to become extratropical near the Japanese island of Iwo Jima. On the next day, the winds fell below typhoon force, and at 00:00UTC on May21, the JMA declared <b>Dolphin</b> extratropical. The storm accelerated to the northeast, passing through the Aleutian Islands on May22. The storm slowed once reaching the Gulf of Alaska, turning eastward to cross the International Date Line on May24.|$|E

40|$|March 18 - 19, 2013 Fishing {{with the}} help of Irrawaddy <b>dolphins</b> is unique to Myanmar. Irrawaddy <b>dolphins,</b> Orcaella brevirostris, which live in about 74 km segment of the Ayeyawady (previously known as Irrawaddy) in upper Myanmar help {{fishermen}} who use castnets for fishing. A total of 51 castnet fishermen from six villages can do fishing with the <b>dolphins</b> and about 21 <b>dolphins</b> in this river segment help the fishermen. <b>Dolphins</b> and fishermen communicate by audio and visual signals during the fishing. Fishermen can catch more fish with less fishing effort and <b>dolphins</b> can also feed easily on those fish which are stunned by the net throws. Irrawaddy <b>dolphins</b> have been protected by law in Myanmar since 1994. Nowadays, cooperative fishing practice between the Irrawaddy <b>dolphins</b> and castnet fishermen in Myanmar has been threatened with extinction by illegal electric fishing. It is an urgent need to study aquatic noise signals of <b>dolphins,</b> impacts of signals used by fishermen in communication with the <b>dolphins</b> and other noises such as boat noise on both <b>dolphins</b> and cooperative fishing practice...|$|R

50|$|Dusky <b>dolphins</b> prefer cool, {{upwelling}} waters, {{as well as}} cold currents. They largely live in {{inshore waters}} {{and can be found}} up to the outer continental shelf and in similar zones in offshore islands. They can move over great distances (around 780 km), but have no well-defined seasonal migrations. However, <b>dolphins</b> off Argentina and New Zealand make inshore and offshore seasonal and diurnal movements. In Argentina, dusky <b>dolphins</b> associate closely with southern right whales and South American sea lions. They have been found around bottlenose <b>dolphins,</b> but apparently do not interact with them, and may share feeding areas with Risso's <b>dolphins.</b> They also associate with various seabirds, such as kelp gulls, cormorants, terns, shearwaters, petrels, and albatrosses. In New Zealand, dusky <b>dolphins</b> mingle with common <b>dolphins.</b> Dusky <b>dolphins</b> have also been observed with southern right whale <b>dolphins</b> and pilot whales off southwestern Africa.|$|R
5|$|River {{dolphins}} {{are five}} species of dolphins which reside in freshwater rivers and estuaries. They are classed in the cetacean superfamily Platanistoidea. Four species live in fresh water rivers. The fifth species, the La Plata <b>dolphin,</b> lives in saltwater estuaries and the ocean. However, it is scientifically classed {{in the river}} <b>dolphin</b> family rather than the oceanic <b>dolphin</b> family. All species have adaptations to facilitate fish catching: a long, forceps-like beak with numerous small teeth in both jaws, broad flippers to allow tight turns, small eyes, and unfused neck vertebrae to allow the head to move {{in relation to the}} body.|$|E
5|$|Some large shark species, such as {{the tiger}} shark, the dusky shark, the great white shark and the bull shark, prey on the {{bottlenose}} <b>dolphin,</b> especially calves. The bottlenose <b>dolphin</b> is capable of defending itself by charging the predator; <b>dolphin</b> 'mobbing' behavior of sharks can occasionally prove fatal for the shark. Targeting a single adult <b>dolphin</b> can be dangerous for a shark of similar size. Killer whale populations in New Zealand and Peru have been observed preying on bottlenose dolphins, but this seems rare, and other orcas may swim with dolphins. Swimming in pods allows dolphins to better defend themselves against predators. Bottlenose dolphins either use complex evasive strategies to outswim their predators, or mobbing techniques to batter the predator to death or force it to flee.|$|E
5|$|The Platanistidae were {{originally}} thought to hold only one species (the South Asian river <b>dolphin),</b> {{but based on}} differences in skull structure, vertebrae and lipid composition, scientists declared the two populations as separate species in the early 1970s. In 1998, {{the results of these}} studies were questioned and the classification reverted to the pre-1970 consensus. Thus, at present, two subspecies are recognized in the genus Platanista, P. gangetica minor (the Indus river <b>dolphin)</b> and P. g. gangetica (the Ganges river <b>dolphin).</b>|$|E
