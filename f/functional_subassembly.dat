40|$|When {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 (HSV- 1) DNA {{replication}} is blocked by viral polymerase inhibitors, such as phosphonoacetic acid (PAA) or acyclovir (ACV), UL 29 (ICP 8) localizes to numerous punctate nuclear foci which are called prereplicative sites. Since this pattern can form in cells infected with mutants which are defective in UL 5, UL 8, UL 9, or UL 52 {{in the presence of}} polymerase inhibitors (C. J. Lukonis and S. K. Weller, J. Virol. 70 : 1751 - 1758, 1996; L. M. Liptak, S. L. Uprichard, and D. M. Knipe, J. Virol. 70 : 1759 - 1767, 1996), we previously proposed that it is unlikely that these numerous UL 29 foci actually represent a <b>functional</b> <b>subassembly</b> of viral replication proteins that could lead to the formation of replication compartments (C. J. Lukonis and S. K. Weller, J. Virol. 70 : 1751 - 1758, 1996). In this paper, we have investigated the requirement for formation of the prereplicative site pattern by using double mutants of HSV. From the analysis of mutants lacking both UL 5 and UL 9, we conclude that neither viral helicase is required for the prereplicative site pattern to form as long as a polymerase inhibitor is present. From the analysis of mutants defective in both UL 30 and UL 5, we suggest that the prereplicative site pattern can form under conditions in which viral and/or cellular polymerases are inhibited. Furthermore, reexamination of the UL 29 staining pattern in cells infected with wild-type virus in the presence of PAA reveals that at least two different UL 29 staining patterns can be detected in these cells. One population of cells contains numerous (greater than 20) punctate UL 29 foci which are sites of cellular DNA synthesis. In another population of cells, fewer punctate foci (less than 15) are detected, and these structures do not colocalize with sites of cellular DNA synthesis. Instead, they colocalize with PML, a component of nuclear matrix structures known as ND 10. We propose that ND 10 -associated UL 29 sites represent domains at which replication compartments form...|$|E
40|$|The {{historical}} {{background for the}} development of the planetary (RFS) is reviewed, and the performance capabilities of the various <b>functional</b> <b>subassemblies</b> are described. The flight radio frequency subsystem is a valid component for the three spacecraft telecommunications functions of tracking, command, and telemetry. It is the radio and the signal processing equipment residing in the spacecraft that interfaces with the control & data subsystem and performs two-way communications with the Earth-based Deep Space Network. The RFS consists of all the elements for RF reception, demodulation, modulation, and transmission, including those for command detection and telemetry modulation...|$|R

Quick-disconnect fasteners are described, along with several devices and methods for attaching thermal insulators, and for joining and separating objects in the absence of gravity...|$|R
