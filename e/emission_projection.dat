40|$|An {{assessment}} of {{the potential impact of}} climate change and the concurrent increase of atmospheric CO 2 concentration on eastern Washington State agriculture was conducted. Climate projections from four selected general circulation models (GCM) were chosen to evaluate impacts for the periods 2010 - 2039, 2030 - 2059 and 2070 - 2099, identified as 2020, 2040, and 2080 scenarios, respectively. All climate projections reflect a warming future climate, but the individual GCMs vary with respect to precipitation changes – some models reflect wetter conditions and some drier.

For this memorandum, the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (RIVM/MNP) took {{on the task of}} updating the <b>emission</b> <b>projections</b> according to the latest insights into emission sources, policies and trends up to 2010. The updated <b>emission</b> <b>projections</b> for SO 2, NOX, NH 3, NMVOC (and also PM 10) will be presented in this report. The projection includes current policy decisions up to July 2003. Effects of new measures announced in the implementation memorandum 'Erop of Eronder' have not been considered in the projections {{with the exception of the}} Dutch NOx-emission trading system. Projections show that given current policies, the emission ceilings for SO 2, NOX and NMVOC will probably not be met in 2010. Additional measures are needed. The emission ceiling for NH 3 seems attainable, although there is still a chance that the ceiling will be exceeded. Results show that the ceiling for SO 2, NOX and NMVOC will be exceeded by approximately 15, 28 and 15 million kg, respectively. Projected emissions for NH 3 are ascertained at about 7 million kg below the emission ceiling.

40|$|Satellite {{and ground}} {{observations}} detected large variability in nitrogen oxides (NOx) during the 2008 economic recession, but {{the impact of}} the recession on air quality has not been quantified. This study combines observed NOx trends and a regional chemical transport model to quantify {{the impact of the}} recession on surface ozone (O 3) levels over the continental United States. The impact is quantified by simulating O 3 concentrations under two emission scenarios: business-as-usual (BAU) and recession. In the BAU case, the <b>emission</b> <b>projection</b> from the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule is used to estimate the “would-be” NOx emission level in 2011. In the recession case, the actual NO 2 trends observed from Air Quality System ground monitors and the Ozone Monitoring Instrument on the Aura satellite are used to obtain “realistic” changes in NOx emissions. The model prediction with the recession effect agrees better with ground O 3 observations over time and space than the prediction with the BAU emission. The results show that the recession caused a 1 – 2 ppbv decrease in surface O 3 concentration over the eastern United States, a slight increase (0. 5 – 1 ppbv) over the Rocky Mountain region, and mixed changes in the Pacific West. The gain in air quality benefits during the recession, however, could be quickly offset by the much slower emission reduction rate during the post-recession period...|$|E

Probable bands of visibility impairment distribution curves are developed for Shenandoah National Park, Smoky Mountain National Park and the Grand Canyon National Park, based on the existing emissions, ``Base Case``, and for the COVE emission reductions, ``CAAA Case``. Emission projections for 2010 are developed with improved versions of the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program <b>emission</b> <b>projection</b> models. Source-receptor transfer matrices created with the Advanced Statistical Trajectory Regional Air Pollution (ASTRAP) model are used with existing emission inventories and with the emission projections to calculate atmospheric concentrations of sulfate and nitrate at the receptors of interest for existing and projected emission scenarios.

VASM combines statistics of observed concentrations of particulate species and relative humidity with ASTRAP calculations of the relative changes in atmospheric sulfate and nitrate particulate concentrations in a Monte Carlo approach to produce expected distributions of hourly particulate concentrations and RH. Light extinction relationships developed in theoretical and field studies are then used to calculate the resulting distribution of visibility impairment.

40|$|Modeling is an {{essential}} tool {{for the development of}} atmospheric emission abatement measures and air quality plans. Most often these plans are related to urban environments with high emission density and population exposure. However, air quality modeling in urban areas is a rather challenging task. As environmental standards become more stringent (e. g. European Directive 2008 / 50 /EC), more reliable and sophisticated modeling tools are needed to simulate measures and plans that may effectively tackle air quality exceedances, common in large urban areas across Europe, particularly for NO 2. This also implies that emission inventories must satisfy a number of conditions such as consistency across the spatial scales involved in the analysis, consistency with the emission inventories used for regulatory purposes and versatility to match the requirements of different air quality and <b>emission</b> <b>projection</b> models. This study reports the modeling activities carried out in Madrid (Spain) highlighting the atmospheric emission inventory development and preparation as an illustrative example of the combination of models and data needed to develop a consistent air quality plan at urban level. These included a series of source apportionment studies to define contributions from the international, national, regional and local sources in order to understand to what extent local authorities can enforce meaningful abatement measures. Moreover, source apportionment studies were conducted in order to define contributions from different sectors and to understand the maximum feasible air quality improvement that can be achieved by reducing emissions from those sectors, thus targeting emission reduction policies to the most relevant activities. Finally, an emission scenario reflecting the effect of such policies was developed and the associated air quality was modeled...|$|E
40|$|Several river basins in {{the world}} are faced with growing water {{scarcity}} and water use conflicts attributed to increasing water demand and competition among users, climate change and variability, and environmental degradation. Addressing these challenges necessitates shifting from the traditional uncoordinated sectoral approach to more integrated and fully participatory approaches supported by credible information generated by reliable and robust technical tools. Combining engineering, economics and hydroclimatological science, hydro-economic tools are well suited to provide reliable and impartial technical information that can support multi stakeholder negotiation and decision making processes in a river basin. This research develops and applies a detailed hydro-economic model to support multi-objective water resources assessments. The model supports integrated assessments of physical and economic impacts of changes in water demand, climate conditions, water resources management objectives and policies, and other system constraints on a basin's water resources. The main contribution of this research is the systematic coupling of detailed water resources and economic assessment models that are capable of (a) representing complex physical system characteristics and constraints; (b) simulating system operation at diverse temporal and spatial scales; and (c) representing water-based economic production processes at a basin scale. The research integrates a wide range of potential climate change impacts into the hydro-economic modeling framework through consideration of multiple future climate change scenarios from 13 Global Circulation Models under the medium and high <b>emission</b> <b>projection</b> scenarios. Economic uncertainty is characterized through conjunctive use of Monte Carlo simulation and Geometric Brownian Motion techniques to generate multiple forecast traces of important economic parameters.

40|$|Global {{warming and}} air quality are {{headline}} environmental issues {{of our time}} and policy must preempt negative international effects with forward-looking strategies. As part of the revision of the European National Emission Ceilings Directive, atmospheric emission projections for European Union countries are being calculated. These projections are useful to drive European air quality analyses and to support wide-scale decision-making. However, when evaluating specific policies and measures at sectoral level, a more detailed approach is needed. This paper presents an original methodology to evaluate emission projections. Emission projections are calculated for each emitting activity that has emissions under three scenarios: without measures (business as usual), with measures (baseline) and with additional measures (target). The methodology developed allows the estimation of highly disaggregated multi-pollutant, consistent emissions for a whole country or region. In order to assure consistency with past emissions included in atmospheric emission inventories and coherence among the individual activities, the consistent <b>emission</b> <b>projection</b> (CEP) model incorporates harmonization and integration criteria as well as quality assurance/quality check (QA/QC) procedures. This study includes a sensitivity analysis as a first approach to uncertainty evaluation. The aim of the model presented in this contribution is to support decision-making process through the assessment of future emission scenarios {{taking into account the}} effect of different detailed technical and non-technical measures and it may also constitute the basis for air quality modelling. The system is designed to produce the information and formats related to international reporting requirements and it allows performing a comparison of national results with lower resolution models such as RAINS/GAINS. The methodology has been successfully applied and tested to evaluate Spanish emission projections up to 2020 for 26 pollutants but the methodology could be adopted for any particular region for different purposes, especially for European countries...|$|E

40|$|<b>Emission</b> <b>projections</b> are {{important}} for environmental policy, both {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of abatement strategies and to determine legislation compliance in the future. Moreover, including uncertainty is an essential added value for decision makers. In this work, projection values and their associated uncertainty are computed for emissions (both air pollutants and greenhouse gases) in Spain following two different approaches. The first one consists of the application of advanced statistical techniques to the most significant activities in terms of emissions. Uncertainty bands have been derived for the Business As Usual (or without measures) scenario through autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. As for the baseline scenario resampling techniques (bootstrap) were applied as an additional nonparametric tool, which does not rely on distributional assumptions and is thus more general. The second approach is based on a sensitivity analysis of <b>emission</b> <b>projections</b> to key inputs on a sectoral basis (both activity rate and emission factor-related parameters).

40|$|Air {{pollution}} abatement policies {{must be based}} on quantitative information on current and future emissions of pollutants. As <b>emission</b> <b>projections</b> uncertainties are inevitable and traditional statistical treatments of uncertainty are highly time/resources consuming, a simplified methodology for nonstatistical uncertainty estimation based on sensitivity analysis is presented in this work. The methodology was applied to the “with measures” scenario for Spain, concretely over the 12 highest emitting sectors regarding greenhouse gas and air pollutants emissions. Examples of methodology application for two important sectors (power plants, and agriculture and livestock) are shown and explained in depth. Uncertainty bands were obtained up to 2020 by modifying the driving factors of the 12 selected sectors and the methodology was tested against a recomputed emission trend in a low economic-growth perspective and official figures for 2010, showing a very good performance. Implications: A solid understanding and quantification of uncertainties related to atmospheric <b>emission</b> inventories and <b>projections</b> provide useful information for policy negotiations. However, as many of those uncertainties are irreducible, there is an interest on how they could be managed in order to derive robust policy conclusions. Taking this into account, a method developed to use sensitivity analysis as a source of information to derive nonstatistical uncertainty bands for <b>emission</b> <b>projections</b> is presented and applied to Spain.

40|$|Ozone and PM 2. 5 {{concentrations}} {{over the}} city of Paris are modeled with the CHIMERE air-quality model at 4 km × 4 km horizontal resolution for two future emission scenarios. A high-resolution (1 km × 1 km) <b>emission</b> <b>projection</b> until 2020 for the greater Paris region is developed by local experts (AIRPARIF) and is further extended to year 2050 based on regional-scale emission projections developed by the Global Energy Assessment. Model evaluation is performed based on a 10 -year control simulation. Ozone is in very good agreement with measurements while PM 2. 5 is underestimated by 20 % over the urban area mainly due to a large wet bias in wintertime precipitation. A significant increase of maximum ozone relative to present-day levels over Paris is modeled under the "business-as-usual" scenario (+ 7 ppb) while a more optimistic "mitigation" scenario leads to a moderate ozone decrease (− 3. 5 ppb) in year 2050. These results are substantially different to previous regional-scale projections where 2050 ozone is found to decrease under both future scenarios. A sensitivity analysis showed that this difference {{is due to the}} fact that ozone formation over Paris at the current urban-scale study is driven by volatile organic compound (VOC) -limited chemistry, whereas at the regional-scale ozone formation occurs under NO x -sensitive conditions. This explains why the sharp NO x reductions implemented in the future scenarios have a different effect on ozone projections at different scales. In rural areas, projections at both scales yield similar results showing that the longer timescale processes of emission transport and ozone formation are less sensitive to model resolution. PM 2. 5 concentrations decrease by 78 % and 89 % under business-as-usual and mitigation scenarios, respectively, compared to the present-day period. The reduction is much more prominent over the urban part of the domain due to the effective reductions of road transport and residential emissions resulting in the smoothing of the large urban increment modeled in the control simulation...|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} numerical modeling framework {{was developed}} to estimate the effects of collective global changes upon ozone pollution in the US in 2050. The framework consists of the global climate and chemistry models, PCM (Parallel Climate Model) and MOZART- 2 (Model for Ozone and Related Chemical Tracers v. 2), coupled with regional meteorology and chemistry models, MM 5 (Mesoscale Meteorological model) and CMAQ (Community Multi-scale Air Quality model). The modeling system was applied for two 10 -year simulations: 1990 – 1999 as a present-day base case and 2045 – 2054 as a future case. For the current decade, the daily maximum 8 -h moving average (DM 8 H) ozone mixing ratio distributions for spring, summer and fall showed good agreement with observations. The future case simulation followed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) A 2 scenario together with business-as-usual US emission projections and projected alterations in land use, land cover (LULC) due to urban expansion and changes in vegetation. For these projections, US anthropogenic NOx (NO+NO 2 ) and VOC (volatile organic carbon) emissions increased by approximately 6 % and 50 %, respectively, while biogenic VOC emissions decreased, in spite of warmer temperatures, due to decreases in forested lands and expansion of croplands, grasslands and urban areas. A stochastic model for wildfire emissions was applied that projected 25 % higher VOC emissions in the future. For the global and US <b>emission</b> <b>projection</b> used here, regional ozone pollution becomes worse in the 2045 – 2054 period for all months. Annually, the mean DM 8 H ozone was projected to increase by 9. 6 ppbv (22 %). The changes {{were higher in the}} spring and winter (25 %) and smaller in the summer (17 %).

It compares the final baseline <b>emission</b> <b>projection</b> developed in 2005 within the Clean Air For Europe (CAFE) programme for the Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution against the recent baseline projection prepared for the revision of the Thematic Strategy in 2012 (the TSAP- 2012 baseline). The report reviews the assumptions on main drivers of emission changes, i. e., demographic trends, economic growth, changes in the energy intensity of GDP, switches to other fuels, and application of dedicated emission control measures. For most of these drivers, reality has developed rather different compared to what has been assumed in 2005. In reality, SO 2 emissions in the old Member States in 2010 were 5 % lower than what was projected by CAFE. NH 3 was 10 % and VOC 3 % lower. NOx exceeded the CAFE projection by 7 %, and PM 2. 5 by 10 %. Larger differences occurred for the new Member States, where SO 2 was 30 % and NH 3 16 % below the levels suggest by CAFE. NOx was 11 % higher, and PM 2. 5 and VOC 21 % higher than estimated earlier. For 2020, the TSAP- 2012 baseline projection expects for the EU- 27 about 20 % less SO 2 emissions than the earlier CAFE baseline, with application of dedicated emission controls as the dominating factor for lower emissions. NOx would be 5 - 7 % lower, depending on the assumptions on the effectiveness of the new vehicle emission standards. The PM projection is about 10 % higher, while smaller differences emerge for VOC and NH 3. Many of these changes are smaller than differences in the actual drivers. In many cases, higher effectiveness of dedicated emission controls compensated the lower than expected decline in total energy consumption as well as the delay in the phase-out of coal. A re-analysis of air pollution control costs based on the actual statistics suggests for 2010 6 % higher costs earlier estimated, mainly due to higher consumption of coal that required more emission control efforts. For 2020, emissions of the new TSAP- 2012 baseline (without additional measures) are substantially higher than the indicative targets for emission reductions established by the Thematic Strategy in 2005. As a consequence, the environmental targets established by the TSAP for the protection of human health, eutrophication and forest acidification would not be met by the TSAP- 2012 baseline without additional measures...|$|E

This work demonstrates an integrated analysis of the effectiveness and likely economic consequences of different climate policy options. In our study we first compare atmospheric observations to the available estimates of PFC emissions for the baseline years 1990 and 1995. We then present <b>projections</b> for regional <b>emissions</b> of PFCs from the aluminum industry using the MIT <b>Emissions</b> <b>Projection</b> and Policy Analysis model under different policy scenarios.

40|$|As {{part of the}} European Commission {{research}} project “Assessment of policy instruments for efficient ozone abatement strategies in Europe”, detailed <b>emission</b> <b>projections</b> {{have been developed for}} the year 2010 based upon currently adopted measures, and feasible reductions. For road-traffic <b>emissions</b> this <b>projection</b> considers passenger cars, light- and heavy-duty vehicles, mopeds and motorcycles. Here we present model calculations made with the EMEP 3 -D Eulerian model to illustrate the relative contribution of each of these road-traffic sectors to ozone concentrations across Europe. The model is run for a six-month period, April–September 1996. The model results clearly suggest that further reduction in road-traffic emissions beyond currently planned measures would be beneficial in reducing ozone over Europe, particularly in the case of heavy-duty vehicles and evaporative emissions. These results do of course depend on the estimated emissions in each sector for the year 2010, and we show that this is a major source of uncertainty in such scenario calculations...|$|R
