5|$|The {{ceremony}} is often held weeks, months, or {{years after the}} death so that the deceased's family can raise the significant funds needed to cover <b>funeral</b> <b>expenses.</b> Torajans traditionally believe that death is not a sudden, abrupt event, but a gradual process toward Puya (the land of souls, or afterlife). During the waiting period, {{the body of the}} deceased is wrapped in several layers of cloth and kept under the tongkonan. The soul of the deceased is thought to linger around the village until the funeral {{ceremony is}} completed, after which it begins its journey to Puya.|$|E
5|$|In early 1897, Boycott's health {{became very}} poor. In {{an attempt to}} improve his health, {{he and his wife}} went on a cruise to Malta.

His funeral took place in the church at Burgh StPeter, conducted by his nephew Arthur StJohn Boycott, who was at Lough Mask during the first boycott. Charles Boycott's widow, Annie, was subsequently sued over the <b>funeral</b> <b>expenses</b> and other debts, and had to sell some assets.

40|$|Background: Despite broad {{public support}} for organ donation, there is a chronic {{shortage}} of deceased donor organs. We sought to identify community preferences for features of organ donation policies. Methods: A discrete choice study was conducted using an online panel of Australian community respondents older than 18 years. Respondents were presented with scenarios comparing a "new" policy to the current policy. Tradeoffs between 8 policy aspects were quantified using mixed logit and latent class models: registration system, extent of donor family involvement, ease of registration, frequency of confirmation of intent, direct payment, and <b>funeral</b> <b>expense</b> reimbursement, priority for donor 2 ̆ 7 s family, and formal recognition of donation. Results: There were 2005 respondents (mean, 44. 6 years). We found a strong preference for a new policy. Overall, respondents favored a policy that included: some involvement of the donor 2 ̆ 7 s family in the final decision, simple registration processes, less frequent reconfirmation of donation intent, direct payment or <b>funeral</b> <b>expense</b> reimbursement, and formal recognition of donation. However, there was significant preference heterogeneity across respondents, with various respondent groups valuing policy mechanisms differently. Respondents who viewed policy change negatively were also those who {{would be unlikely to}} be organ donors anyway, because they tended to hold negative views toward organ donation. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the Australian community are open to alternative organ donation policies including changes to: registration systems, family involvement, and financial and nonfinancial mechanisms. Future policy discussions should not be limited by preconceived notions of what is acceptable to the community, rather informed by actual community values and preferences...|$|R
50|$|PAMI covers around 25 million doctor's {{visits and}} nearly 2 million {{prescriptions}} annually. Surgical procedures {{covered by the}} agency in 2009 included over 55,000 for cataracts, 50,000 intraocular lenses, 20,000 hip and knee surgeries, and 700 organ transplants. Other benefits include kinesiology, legal aid, mental health, and <b>funeral</b> <b>expense</b> assistance. Benefits represent 10% of the total pension payments issued by ANSES, the national social security agency. The real {{market value of the}} medical services, medicine, and other services provided by PAMI, however, amount to 30% of retirees' income. the total expenditure on drugs for PAMI in 2010 was almost us$750 million; were retirees to pay the market price of these drugs, their cost would have approximated us$3 billion. Private health insurance is widely available in Argentina.

25|$|Economic drivers {{leading to}} {{increased}} donation {{are not limited}} to areas such as India and Africa, but also are emerging in the United States.

25|$|Pliny was {{a strong}} {{advocate}} for training vines up trees in a pergola, noting that the finest wines in Campania all derived from this practice.
