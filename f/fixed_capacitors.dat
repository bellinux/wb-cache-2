40|$|The unified {{power quality}} {{conditioner}} (UPQC) {{is a combination}} of a shunt and a series compensator cascaded via a DC link capacitor which works on the combined principle of active filtering and dynamic voltage restoration. Therefore, the UPQC can be a potential solution to the grid integration problems associated with fixed speed wind generators including reactive power compensation and fault ride through capability. The hardware design of the UPQC can be made more cost effective by proper selection of the rating of the individual compensators of the UPQC.

40|$|Abstract {{approved}} (Major prof es sor) The {{field-effect transistor}} offers advantages as a chopping de-vice since {{it does not}} have an offset voltage and it is not speed lirnited by its response tirne. Offset and drift are caused by Ieakage current and capacitive coupling between the control gate and the signal path. The capacitive component of this drift is proportional to frequency so in order to increase the chopping frequency and rnaintain low drift, it is neces-sary to cornpensate for the capacitive drifts. Two techniques of balancing a second capacitor against the detrirnental gate-drain capacitance of the chopper are investigated. First a <b>fixed</b> <b>capacitor</b> is used for balance, and capacitive off-set is reduced by about t / ZO. This balance is then irnproved by using the capacitance of a second FET for balance. This irnproves capacitive balance by a factor of two over the <b>fixed</b> <b>capacitor</b> technique and also allows for Redacted for Privacy cancellation of leakage currents. An FET chopper when operating at lOKC and balanced with a second FET is observed to have a zero drift of less than I 0 uv frorn zooc to t oooc...|$|R
5000|$|In 1949, the Czech {{engineer}} Jiří Vackář {{published a}} paper {{on the design of}} stable variable-frequency oscillators (VFO). The paper discussed many stability issues such as variations with temperature, atmospheric pressure, component aging, and microphonics. For example, Vackář describes making inductors by first heating the wire and then winding the wire on a stable ceramic coil form. The resulting inductor has a temperature coefficient of 6 to 8 parts per million per degree Celsius. [...] Vackář points out that common air variable capacitors have a stability of 2 parts per thousand; to build a VFO with a stability of 50 parts per million requires that the variable capacitor is only 1/40 of the tuning capacity (.002/40 = 50ppm). The stability requirement also implies the variable capacitor may only tune a limited range of 1:1.025. Larger tuning ranges require switching stable <b>fixed</b> <b>capacitors</b> or inductors.|$|E

The analyzer was described in a 1930 paper by H.L Hazen, O.R. Schurig and M.F. Gardner. The base quantities for the analyzer were 200 volts, and 0.5 amperes. Sensitive portable thermocouple-type instruments were used for measurement. The analyzer occupied four large panels, arranged in a U-shape, with tables {{in front of each}} section to hold measuring instruments. While primarily conceived as an educational tool, the analyzer saw considerable use by outside firms, who would pay to use the device. American Gas and Electric Company, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and many other organizations studied problems on the MIT analyzer in its first decade of operation. In 1940 the system was moved and expanded to handle more complex systems.|$|E

40|$|In the {{industrial}} sector the various motoring loads are continuously running and generating the inductive load. So the power factor in this system gets reduced due to the inductive reactive power. But the electricity board has a standard limits regarding the power factor values and if the power factor goes below the specified limit; the electricity company charges the penalty to {{the industrial}} consumers. The automatic power factor correction panel provides the required compensation to overcome the inductive reactance by using the power capacitors. The microcontroller 8051 receives current signal from current transformer and simultaneously gives the signals to the various contactors to connect the capacitors in the line for the compensation. Thus by adding the capacitor to the line will compensate the reactive power and maintains the power factor near to unity. This will avoids the penalty to the industrial consumers and may get the incentives. In the conventional methods we were using the <b>fixed</b> <b>capacitor</b> for compensation.
