Robert Bianco from USA Today comments, [...] "(i)n a medium in which producers tend to grow bored with their own creations, either trashing them or taking them in increasingly bizarre directions, Whedon continues {{to find new ways to}} make his fabulously entertaining series richer and more compelling. With or without words, he's a TV treasure." [...] In the Ottawa Citizen, Chuck Barney writes, [...] "I wondered if this enormously entertaining cult favourite would lose some starch once our favourite little slayer moved on to college. But happily, it continues to win us over with the way it deftly bounces between the genres of comedy, horror and romance. The recent silent episode (Hush) was brilliant." [...] Alan Sepinwall in The Star-Ledger calls it a [...] "magnificently daring episode", explaining [...] "(w)hat makes it particularly brave is that, even when Buffy has been failing to click dramatically this year, the show has still been able to get by on the witty dialogue, which is all but absent after the first few scenes. Whedon finds ways to <b>get</b> <b>around</b> <b>that,</b> with several cast members—particularly Anthony Head as the scholarly Giles and Alyson Hannigan as nervous witch Willow—proving to be wonderfully expressive silent comedians." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Britain in the 1930s, {{when the}} Windmill Theatre, London, began to present nude shows, British law {{prohibited}} performers moving whilst {{in a state}} of nudity. [...] To <b>get</b> <b>around</b> <b>that</b> rule, models appeared naked in stationary tableaux vivants. To keep within the law, sometimes devices were used which rotated the models without them moving themselves. Fan dances were another device used to keep performances within the law. These allowed a naked dancer's body to be concealed by her fans or those of her attendants, until the end of an act, when she posed naked for a brief interval whilst standing stock still, and the lights went out or the curtain dropped to allow her to leave the stage. Changes in the law in the 1960s brought about a boom of strip clubs in Soho, with [...] "fully nude" [...] dancing and audience participation. Following the introduction of the Policing and Crime Act 2009, a local authority licence is required for venues in England and Wales (and later Scotland) where live nude entertainment takes place more than 11 times a year.|$|E

6000|$|... "I hope not," [...] {{answered}} the banker, dryly. [...] "Utopia {{is a dream}} in which those who do the rough work of the world cannot afford to indulge. And {{there is one more}} question. You will, no doubt, deride it as practical, but to my mind it is very much to the point. You condemn the business practices in which I have engaged all my life as utterly unchristian. If you are logical, you will admit that no man or woman who owns stock in a modern corporation is, according to your definition, Christian, and, to use your own phrase, can enter the Kingdom of God. I can tell you, as one who knows, that there is no corporation in this country which, in the struggle to maintain itself, is not forced to adopt the natural law of the survival of the fittest, which you condemn. Your own salary, while you had it, came from men who had made the money in corporations. Business is business, and admits of no sentimental considerations. If you can <b>get</b> <b>around</b> <b>that</b> fact, I will gladly bow to your genius. Should you succeed in reestablishing St. John's on what you call a free basis--and in my opinion you will not--even then the money, you would live on, and which supported the church, would be directly or indirectly derived from corporations." ...|$|E
