5|$|Like {{a number}} of other delta-wing {{aircraft}} designed to cruise at very high speeds, the Valkyrie included a droop-nose that allowed the pilots to view the ground during the nose-high takeoff and landing. The Concorde or Tupolev Tu-144 both used a design where the entire nose section was angled downward, including outer window panels, exposing interior windows that were more vertically angled. In the B-70 design, only the upper section of the nose moved down into a fixed lower section, and the outer window panels moved with it to become more vertical, at 24degrees slope. With the nose raised into its high-speed position, the outer windows were almost <b>horizontal.</b> <b>A</b> system that blew 600F air from the engines was used for both defogging and rain removal. The lower forward section included a radar bay, and production machines were to be equipped with a refueling receptacle on the upper surface of the nose.|$|E
25|$|A single Mk I PR Type E N3117 {{was built}} to address a {{requirement}} for oblique close-ups as opposed to high altitude vertical pictures. This conversion carried an F24 camera in a fairing under each wing. These faced forward, were splayed outwards slightly and aimed downwards at about 15 degrees below the <b>horizontal.</b> <b>A</b> 29 gal (132 l) fuel tank was fitted in the rear fuselage. N3117 proved most useful as {{it was able to}} photograph targets under weather conditions that would make high altitude photography impossible and experience with this aircraft resulted {{in the development of the}} Type G.|$|E
500|$|The first {{skeletal}} reconstructions {{show the}} skull in a near-horizontal posture. Salgado (1999) argued {{that such a}} posture would have been anatomically impossible due to the elongated neural spines of the neck vertebrae. Instead, he envisaged the head in a nearly vertical orientation. The habitual orientation of the head is usually reflected by {{the orientation of the}} semicircular canals of the inner ear, which housed the sense of balance (vestibular system). Using their three-dimensional model of the inner ear, Carabajal and colleagues suggested that the snout faced downwards at an angle of roughly 65° relative to the <b>horizontal.</b> <b>A</b> similar value has recently been proposed for the related Diplodocus. The neutral posture of the neck can be approximated based on how the cervical vertebrae attached to each other. According to Carabajal and colleagues, the neck was gently sloping downwards, so that the snout would have rested [...] above the ground in neutral posture. In reality, neck posture would have varied according to the respective activities of the animals. Raising of the neck, e.g. for reaching an alert position, would have been constricted by the elongated neural spines, not permitting heights greater than [...]|$|E

6000|$|... 494. A glass basin (fig. 52.), {{four inches}} in {{diameter}} and four inches deep, had a division of mica a, fixed across the upper part so as to descend one {{inch and a half}} below the edge, and be perfectly water-tight at the sides: a plate of platina b, three inches wide, was put into the basin {{on one side of the}} division a, and retained there by a glass block below, so that any gas produced by it in a future stage of the experiment should not ascend beyond the mica, and cause currents in the liquid on that side. A strong solution of sulphate of magnesia was carefully poured without splashing into the basin, until it rose a little above the lower edge of the mica division a, great care being taken that the glass or mica on the unoccupied or c side of the division in the figure, should not be moistened by agitation of the solution above the level to which it rose. A thin piece of clean cork, well-wetted in distilled water, was then carefully and lightly placed on the solution at the c side, and distilled water poured gently on to it until a stratum the eighth of an inch in thickness appeared over the sulphate of magnesia; all was then left for a few minutes, that any solution adhering to the cork might sink away from it, or be removed by the water on which it now floated; and then more distilled water was added in a similar manner, until it reached nearly to the top of the glass. In this way solution of the sulphate occupied the lower part of the glass, and also the upper on the right-hand side of the mica; but on the left-hand side of the division a stratum of water from c to d, one inch and a half in depth, reposed upon it, the two presenting, when looked through horizontally, a comparatively definite plane of contact. A second platina pole e, was arranged so as to be just under the surface of the water, in a position nearly <b>horizontal,</b> <b>a</b> little inclination being given to it, that gas evolved during decomposition might escape: the part immersed was three inches and a half long by one inch wide, and about seven-eighths of an inch of water intervened between it and the solution of sulphate of magnesia.|$|E
