50|$|When Alfonso XI died {{suddenly}} in a siege of Gibraltar, {{attempts were made}} by his half brother King Pedro I, his mother, and her court favorite, the Duke of Albuquerque to <b>disposess</b> the entire family of Eleanor. This and the subsequent execution of Eleanor in Talavera in 1351, led to rebellion by Eleanor's sons, Henry, future Henry II of Castile, Fadrique, Tello of Castile, and Sancho of Castile, Count of Alburquerque. Each rebelled from their independent corners of the Spanish kingdom. Through a combination of threats and diplomacy, Peter I of Castile was able to elicit fealty and a temporary reconciliation with his half-brothers. But this was not to last. Fadrique was named royal emissary to France, where he went to escort the Pedro's bride, Blanche of Bourbon. The subsequent turmoil of this marriage and Pedro's entanglement with his mistress, María de Padilla, was unlikely to have help cement a relationship between Pedro and Fadrique.|$|E
40|$|Although {{the study}} of manors has a long {{tradition}} in Estonian historical science, there are still some gaps. One such area is the theme of semi-manors or landstellen, which can be considered one of the least-studied subject fields. The term landstelle itself is very complicated. Its Estonian counterpart semi-manor was probably introduced only in the 1960 s. It is very difficult to define the concept because landstelle could mean a number of things in German—for example, a farm, a piece of land, etc. Historians have tried to define the term. According to one definition, it was an agnonomically independent manor that was small and had none of the priviledges pertaining to knight manors. They were separate from knight manors. Another vital aspect was that they did not meet the requirements imposed on knight manors: in Baltic provinces it was required from knight manor to have a certain amount of arable land. In conclusion, a semi-manor was a middle-sized landholding that could be placed somewhere between a knight manor and a farm. It is impossible to say the complete number of semi-manors in both provinces. From Estland at least 120 are known, situated mainly in Virumaa County. In Livonia the number was much smaller: only 25 of them are attested. Semi-manors usually came into existence through separation from an enfranchised knight manor. A number of them were former knight manors that lost their status as such. In Estland the average semi-manor was over 500 dessiatine in size; in Livonia their area amounted to over 200 dessiatine. As a rule they consisted of manor land or farm land or both. Some included quota land (one-sixth of the land formerly available to peasants). A semi-manor was an underpriviledged possession, but its owner could use anything produced from the land water belonging to the manor. The owner could also found and maintain factories or other economic installations, he could <b>disposess</b> his manor, he had the right to rent out land, etc. Mortgaging semi-manors was not widespread. Some semi-manors were included in entailments. Semi-manors could be divided into several subdivisions. The majority of them belonged to private owners. Some were owned by different institutions such as a nobility corporation, towns, or firms. Beginning in the twentieth century, a number of semi-manors were acquired by Russian banks. A least 30 semi-manors in Estland were former knight manors. Some were actually factories or summer resorts. Even some islands were deemed as semi-manors. Others were actually a conglomeration of farms. Although it could be easily concluded that semi-manors were mainly owned by burghers, it was not so in Estland. Nobility was solidly represented among semi-manor owners. Before the confiscation of manors in 1919, they had acquired a dominant position. Other estates—those of peasants and burghers—experienced a decline. For Estonian peasants, semi-manors offered the opportunity to become landholders even before 1860 s. In contrast to the province of Estland, semi-manors were to a greater extent burgher-owned manors in Livonia. Manors were confiscated in Estonia in 1919 by an agrarian law enacted by the Estonian Provisional Government. Semi-manors were exempted from the appropriation when they did not belong to owners of knight manors. The most affected were, therefore, registered nobility as this group possessed a number of semi-manors and knight manors simultaneously. Those nobles lost their landhold...|$|E
