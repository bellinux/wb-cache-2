5|$|Believing Mercer to {{have been}} captured, General Currie assumed command of the battle and {{with the use of}} {{saturation}} bombardment was able to retake the lost trenches and drive the Germans back to Mount Sorrel despite heavy casualties. On the 21 June a Canadian burial party found 30 bodies in a sector of trench, amongst them General Mercer's remains, only recognisable by his uniform decoration. Mercer was buried in a military grave at Lijssenthoek Military Cemetery, later surmounted with a Commonwealth War Grave headstone. Mercer's funeral was attended by many men of his Division and from his old regiments as well as numerous Canadian and British officers who had worked alongside him. Mercer was posthumously mentioned in dispatches for his courage under fire, the third time <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> mentioned, and his division was taken over by Major-General Louis Lipsett who was himself killed in action two years later. Mercer is remembered as an efficient and capable organiser who never got the opportunity to demonstrate the tactical nous he had shown in training and exercises. He also remains the highest ranking Canadian officer to ever be killed in combat and reportedly by friendly fire.|$|E

25|$|Toftoy {{retired from}} the Army due to health reasons in 1960 and moved to Treasure Island, Florida, where he had a private boat landing {{and access to the}} Gulf of Mexico for indulging in his passion for fishing. Retirement, however, did not mean the end of Toftoy's {{contributions}} to the field in which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> dominant a figure. Among other activities, he was retained as a consultant by the Northrop Corporation and by the Brown Engineering Company. Involvement in civic affairs, which had been so meaningful at Huntsville, Alabama, continued after his retirement, and was climaxed when he was elected President of the Isle of Capri Civic Association in 1962.|$|E
25|$|A merger {{between this}} company {{with several other}} small match {{companies}} in Sweden, the company AB Svenska Förenade Tändsticksfabriker was founded in 1913 with Ivar Kreuger as the general manager. Later, by merging with the largest match company in Sweden, AB Jönköping-Vulcan, Svenska Tändsticks AB (Swedish Match) was founded in 1917. Ivar had originally tried to convince AB Jönköping-Vulcan to merge in December 1912, but {{they had not been}} interested as Vulcan was the dominating match company in Sweden. Ivar then started to acquire all of the match companies as well as most of the raw material companies he could find in and around Sweden and then finally got AB Jönköping-Vulcan to accept the merger. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> persuasive in arguing for the merger that he managed to overvalue his side of the deal so that it was essentially the smaller organization taking over the larger one. It was his first big venture in inflating values, which became his prime tactic thereafter.|$|E

500|$|He {{worked his}} way up at the Royal Infirmary from dresser ({{surgical}} assistant), to surgical clerk, to house physician, house surgeon and finally full surgeon.

2500|$|In April 2014, Snowden and Laura Poitras {{were awarded}} the Ridenhour Truth-Telling Prize, given by The Nation Institute and The Fertel Foundation for {{transparency}} and whistleblowing. Snowden and Poitras each appeared on video at the National Press Club {{to accept the}} award. Snowden gave a speech and took questions from the audience, who accorded him several standing ovations.

2500|$|The {{material}} {{that made it}} onto the album proper was released as Falling Into Infinity, which received a mixed reception from fans who were {{more familiar with the}} band's earlier sound. While the album was moderately progressive-sounding, tracks such as [...] "Hollow Years" [...] and [...] "You Not Me" [...] prompted some to believe it was the dawn of a new, mainstream-sounding Dream Theater. Overall, the album was both a critical and commercial disappointment. Although Portnoy did not speak out publicly at the time, he later revealed in the 2004 DVD commentary for 5 Years in a Livetime, that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> discouraged during this period that he had considered disbanding Dream Theater altogether.|$|E

2500|$|His {{attitude}} toward the National Socialist regime in the late 1930s and early 1940s is difficult to understand. By his own account, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> influenced by the early Nazi promise of release from the post–World War I economic effects, that his patriotic feelings had increased. In a 1952 memoir article he admitted that, at that time, he [...] "fared relatively rather well under totalitarianism". Yet, he also wrote that [...] "to us, Hitler was still only a pompous fool with a Charlie Chaplin moustache" [...] and that he perceived him as [...] "another Napoleon" [...] who was [...] "wholly without scruples, a godless man who thought himself the only god".|$|E
2500|$|This murder led to {{his being}} sentenced to death in April 1992.

[...] He had a strange odor; he later told his lawyer that he had smeared himself with deer feces to divert police dogs. [...] When charged with first-degree murder, {{kidnapping}} and four counts of rape, he pleaded no contest, saying <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> drunk that he did not remember the killing. [...] He could not think of a motive either, blaming childhood poverty and life in prison.

2500|$|In 1911, despite most pitches being totally unhelpful in an {{exceptionally}} dry summer, Smith seized his few chances {{so well that}} he was second highest wicket-taker {{in the country with}} 160. 1912 was a wet summer that suited Smith’s bowling, yet prior to the last three games <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> out of form - bowling when clearly unfit - that he had the poor record of 69 wickets at 21.43 each. Deadly bowling in the last three games improved his record, yet he was a complete failure (aside from his only first-class century at No. 11) on an MCC tour of the West Indies. 1913 was basically a repeat of 1912 – [...] "Razor" [...] came into form only {{at the tail end of}} the season – and in 1914 Smith could rarely play due to injuries continuing to recur.|$|E

2500|$|Visits {{from his}} mother to Likani were greatly enjoyable. In 1895, George and his mother visited Denmark. They had not seen their Danish {{relatives}} for four years.

Then suddenly, his health deteriorated, [...] "Yesterday, in the garden, he expectorated some blood...that frightened me more than I can tell - the surprise of it was shocking, because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> well of late...I am quite desperate that this should have happened here" [...] As a result, George was forbidden to smoke and confined to bed until he was fit enough to return to Likani. Writing to Nicholas back home once again, George said about his trip to Denmark, [...] "Of course it was good to see the family after 4 years, but it did not really do me any good, as I lost more than 5 pounds which I had put on with such difficulty in May and June.

2500|$|His {{close friend}} Padre Agostino wrote {{to him in}} 1915, asking {{specific}} questions, such as when he first experienced visions, whether he had been granted the stigmata, and whether he felt the pains of the Passion of Christ, namely the crowning of thorns and the scourging. Padre Pio replied {{that he had been}} favoured with visions since his novitiate period (1903 to 1904). He wrote that although he had been granted the stigmata, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> terrified by the phenomenon he begged the Lord to withdraw them. He wrote that he did not wish the pain to be removed, only the visible wounds, since at the time he purportedly considered them to be an indescribable and almost unbearable humiliation. [...] The visible wounds disappeared at that point, but reappeared in September 1918. He reported, however, that the pain remained and was more acute on specific days and under certain circumstances. He also said that he was suffering the pain of the crown of thorns and the scourging. He did not define the frequency of these occurrences but said that he had been suffering from them at least once weekly for some years.|$|E
