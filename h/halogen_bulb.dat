25|$|The first dual-filament <b>halogen</b> <b>bulb</b> {{to produce}} both a low {{and a high}} beam, the H4 (60/55W @ 12V, 1650/1000lm ±15% @ 13.2V), was {{released}} in 1971 and quickly became the predominant headlamp bulb throughout the world except in the United States, where the H4 is still not legal for automotive use. In 1992, the Americans created their own standard for a bulb called HB2: almost identical to H4 except with more stringent constraints on filament geometry and positional variance, and power consumption and light output expressed at the US test voltage of 12.8V.|$|E

25|$|The burners for {{the lights}} were changed from colza oil to {{paraffin}} oil in 1876. The original system was in use for 60 years, and in 1925, the optical apparatus was upgraded to a second order dioptric lens with an incandescent oil burner. This changed the light output to three flashes in quick succession every 30 seconds. A diesel electric plant was installed in 1954, and electrical operation of the beam started in October of that year. The diesel generator was replaced in 1970. In September 1999, the light was replaced again, {{this time with a}} rotating beacon, with a 35-watt <b>halogen</b> <b>bulb</b> as the light source. The energy comes from solar panels and a battery bank.|$|E

50|$|Compact {{fluorescent}} lamps are an existing technology that currently exceed the EISA 2007 requirements for lumens per watt. Another lesser known existing technology that also meets the minimum EISA requirements is energy efficient <b>halogen</b> <b>bulbs</b> (see below).|$|R
50|$|The 5000 series {{units have}} fully {{automatic}} Scharfenberg couplers as standard {{instead of the}} first batch's semi-automatic knuckle couplers, and LED lamps for headlights and interior lighting instead of <b>halogen</b> <b>bulbs</b> and fluorescent tubes.

50|$|The {{continuous}} lighting uses tungsten bulbs with a {{colour temperature}} of around 3200° instead of daylight-balanced (5500°) flash tubes. All units accept the same range of light modifiers as the flash units, {{subject to the}} additional heat generated by the bulbs. The Scanlite range employ <b>halogen</b> <b>bulbs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The European Commission banned low {{efficiency}} general-purpose, non-directional incandescent lightbulbs from 2012, though similarly shaped higher-efficiency <b>halogen</b> <b>bulbs</b> {{continue to}} be available (although halogen cannot be considered high-efficiency when compared to Compact fluorescent lamp and LED bulbs). The United Kingdom banned them voluntarily from 2011 after Ireland in 2009.|$|R
25|$|The first US <b>halogen</b> {{headlamp}} <b>bulb,</b> {{introduced in}} 1983, was the HB1/9004. It is a 12.8-volt, transverse dual-filament design that produces 700 lumens on low beam and 1200 lumens on high beam. The 9004 is rated for 65 watts (high beam) and 45 watts (low beam) at 12.8 volts. Other US approved <b>halogen</b> <b>bulbs</b> include the HB3 (65W, 12.8V), HB4 (55W, 12.8V), and HB5 (65/55 watts, 12.8V). All of the European-designed and internationally approved bulbs except H4 are presently approved {{for use in}} headlamps complying with US requirements.|$|R
50|$|The {{position}} and {{the direction of the}} bulb can be adjusted; thanks to two counterweights, moving it requires little effort. Two other features of this lamp are the lack of wires (the two parallel arms are used to conduct electricity to the bulb - connected with snap fasteners that are riveted to the arms), and the <b>halogen</b> <b>bulb,</b> which was previously mainly used in the automotive industry.|$|E
5000|$|The 1969 Monaco offered, as a $50 option, {{the first}} modern polyellipsoidal (projector) {{automotive}} road lamp. Called [...] "Super-Lite" [...] and mounted in the driver's side of the grille, this auxiliary headlamp was produced in {{a joint venture between}} Chrysler Corporation and Sylvania. It uses an 85 watt <b>halogen</b> <b>bulb</b> and was intended as a mid-beam, to extend the reach of the low beams during turnpike travel when low beams alone were inadequate but high beams would produce excessive glare to oncoming drivers.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, {{incandescent}} and halogen bulbs were used. Because {{of the low}} {{efficiency of}} light output and a {{single point of failure}} (filament burnout) municipalities are increasingly retrofitting traffic signals with LED arrays that consume less power, have increased light output, last significantly longer, and {{in the event of an}} individual LED failure, still operate albeit with a reduced light output. With the use of optics, the light pattern of an LED array can be comparable to the pattern of an incandescent or <b>halogen</b> <b>bulb.</b>|$|E
50|$|The first US <b>halogen</b> {{headlamp}} <b>bulb,</b> {{introduced in}} 1983, was the HB1/9004. It is a 12.8-volt, transverse dual-filament design that produces 700 lumens on low beam and 1200 lumens on high beam. The 9004 is rated for 65 watts (high beam) and 45 watts (low beam) at 12.8 volts.

25|$|HID {{headlamps}} {{are significantly}} more costly to produce, install, purchase, and repair. The extra {{cost of the}} HID lights may exceed the fuel cost savings through their reduced power consumption, though some of this cost disadvantage is offset by the longer lifespan of the HID burner relative to <b>halogen</b> <b>bulbs.</b>|$|R
25|$|Tungsten-halogen lamps are a {{very common}} light source for {{headlamps}} and other forward illumination functions. Some recent-model vehicles use small <b>halogen</b> <b>bulbs</b> for exterior signalling and marking functions, as well. The first halogen lamp approved for automotive use was the H1, which was introduced in Europe in 1962, 55 W producing 1500 lm.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the spit}} only {{reaching}} 30 m {{above sea level}} at this point, the lighthouse has to be taller than usual for New Zealand's coast. The light of the 27 m tall tower can be seen for 35 km. The original oil-burning lamp was converted to a 1000 watt electric lamp in 1954, and the diesel power supply replaced by a buried mains electricity cable along the spit in 1966. The original lamp was changed to a modern rotation beacon with a 50 tungsten <b>halogen</b> <b>bulb</b> in 1999.|$|E
50|$|The {{success of}} the Kel-Lite led {{to the rise of}} competition, {{primarily}} Maglite and Streamlight, who improved on Keller's basic concept. Streamlight opted for high-output models using rechargeable battery and <b>halogen</b> <b>bulb</b> technology. Maglite developed an improved switch and a variable-focus system, allowing a single light to be used for a high-intensity flashlight or wide-angle lantern. Mag-Lite later developed their own high-output rechargeable, as the police market converted entirely to that style of flashlight. A decade later a new company, Laser Products, miniaturized the tactical flashlight with their SureFire series.|$|E
50|$|MR lamps {{have several}} {{disadvantages}} over {{other types of}} lighting, most notably their high operating temperature and the risks of explosion from their pressurized bulb. The <b>halogen</b> <b>bulb</b> can reach temperatures over 200 °C, increasing the risk of fire should anything flammable come in contact or even be {{in close proximity to}} the bulb or fixture. The quartz capsule containing the filament and halogen gas is pressurized and can explode if improperly handled or damaged, and must be handled carefully prior to installation to prevent contamination with oil and salt from fingerprints, which can dramatically shorten the lamp's life.|$|E
500|$|The third {{ball was}} revamped again in 1995 for 1996, adding a {{computerized}} lighting system with 180 <b>halogen</b> <b>bulbs</b> and 144 strobe lights, and over 12,000 rhinestones. Lighting designer Barry Arnold {{stated that the}} changes were [...] "something [...] {{had to be done}} to make this event more spectacular as we approach the millennium." ...|$|R
500|$|The fourth ball, {{measuring}} [...] {{in diameter}} and weighing , incorporated a total of over 600 <b>halogen</b> <b>bulbs,</b> 504 triangle-shaped crystal panels provided by Waterford, 96 strobe lights, and spinning, pyramid-shaped mirrors. The ball was constructed at Waterford's factory in Ireland, and was then shipped to New York City, where the lighting system and motorized mirrors were installed.|$|R
50|$|A {{new feature}} {{available}} {{for the first time}} in its class are the optional full-LED headlamps combined with a full beam assistant. The full-LED headlamps offer numerous advantages over standard <b>halogen</b> <b>bulbs</b> such as improved illumination, a close to daylight colour temperature, lower energy consumption and an extended service life. The front fog lights can include a cornering feature.|$|R
