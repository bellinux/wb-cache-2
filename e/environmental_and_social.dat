5|$|In 2011, UBS {{expanded}} its global compliance database to include information on <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> issues provided by RepRisk, a global research firm specialized in environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) risk analytics and metrics. This {{was done in}} an effort to mitigate <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> risks that could impact the bank's reputation or financial performance and to simultaneously help globally standardize and systematically implement the firm's due diligence processes. RepRisk data is used in the on-boarding process to screen potential new clients and sourcing partners, alongside periodic client reviews and, also, to evaluate the risks related to transactions in investment banking and institutional lending.|$|E

5|$|Sigmund Freud, {{the founder}} of psychoanalytic theory, {{discussed}} the ego's role in balancing the immediate pleasure-driven desires of the id with the morality-driven choices of the superego. Funder and Block expanded psychoanalytic research on the topic, and found that impulsivity, {{or a lack of}} ego-control, has a stronger effect on one's ability to delay rewards if a reward is more desirable. Finally, <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> factors play a role; for example, delay is affected by the self-imposed or external nature of a reward contingency, by the degree of task engagement required during the delay, by early mother-child relationship characteristics, by a person's previous experiences with unreliable promises of rewards (e.g., in poverty), and by contemporary sociocultural expectations and paradigms. Research on animals comprises another body of literature describing delayed gratification characteristics that are not as easily tested in human samples, such as ecological factors affecting the skill.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to propose a model for {{measuring}} sustainable value which would complexly assess <b>environmental,</b> <b>social,</b> <b>and</b> corporate governance contribution to value creation. In the paper {{the concept of the}} Sustainable <b>Environmental,</b> <b>Social</b> <b>and</b> Corporate Governance Value Added is presented. The Sustainable <b>Environmental,</b> <b>Social</b> <b>and</b> Corporate Governance Value Added is based on the Sustainable Value Added model <b>and</b> combines weighted <b>environmental,</b> <b>social,</b> <b>and</b> corporate governance indicators with their benchmarks determined by Data Envelopment Analysis. Benchmark values of indicators were set for each company separately and determine the optimal combination of <b>environmental,</b> <b>social,</b> <b>and</b> corporate governance inputs to economic outcomes. The Sustainable <b>Environmental,</b> <b>Social</b> <b>and</b> Corporate Governance Value Added methodology is applied on real-life corporate data and presented through a case study. The value added of most of the selected companies was negative, even though economic indicators of all of them are positive. The Sustainable <b>Environmental,</b> <b>Social</b> <b>and</b> Corporate Governance Value Added is intended to help owners, investors, and other stakeholders in their decision-making and sustainability assessment. The use of <b>environmental,</b> <b>social,</b> <b>and</b> corporate governance factors helps identify the company’s strengths and weaknesses, and provides a more sophisticated insight into it than the one-dimensional methods based on economic performance alone...|$|R
5|$|This event {{creating}} a sustainable and reliable {{relationship with the}} general public is {{a significant part of}} THSRC’s corporate vision and an important foundation of <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> sustainability. Therefore, it will continue making efforts to establish a good partnership with the general public {{as well as with the}} stakeholders, customers, employees, suppliers, communities and the government.

5|$|Tang has {{expressed}} concern about <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> issues through his art, such as the works They Poach the Rhino, Chop Off His Horn and Make This Drink (1989), Under the Table All Going One Direction (1992) and Tiger's Whip. He first presented the latter work, an installation and performance piece, in 1991 in Singapore's Chinatown. It consisted of ten life-sized tigers made from wire mesh covered with white linen. Tang, wearing a sleeveless white garment, dragged one of the tigers behind him. A {{modified version of the}} installation is in the Singapore Art Museum. It features a tiger with its front paws resting {{on the back of a}} rocking chair, which is draped with a piece of red cloth and with a phallus painted on it in red. The work highlights how the tiger is being hunted to extinction for its penis, which some Chinese believe has aphrodisiac qualities. In February 1995, the Museum chose Tiger's Whip to represent Singapore at the Africus International Biennale in Johannesburg, South Africa. Another of Tang's works in the Singapore Art Museum is an untitled sculpture often called Axe (1991), which is an axe with a plant growing out of its wooden handle. It is regarded as an early example of found art in Singapore.|$|E
