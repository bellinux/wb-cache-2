40|$|Summary: Non-linear {{saturation}} kinetics can {{be described}} through a potency function, a trigonometric function, a logarithmic function, a hyperbolic function, or an exponential function. Saturable <b>enzyme</b> reaction <b>kinetics</b> can be alternatively formulated as a 1 -exp function without the limitations of a steady-state assumption (d[C]/dt = 0, where C is the enzyme-substrate complex). The time-dependent substrate conversion (—d[S]/df = Kmax { 1 — exp(—ATa [S]) }) depends on the maximum velocity (Fmax), the association constant (Ka) and substrate concen-tration [S]. In contrast to the classical Michaelis-Menten equation, the 1 -exp function has an explicit solution for the substrate concentration [S] in an integrated form. [S] = (l/ATa) ln[l- (1 - expC/ς [S] 0)) exp(- K * Fmax t) ] A deceleration term must be introduced to describe <b>enzyme</b> reaction <b>kinetics</b> realistically. The 1 -exp function with deceleration term can also be expanded to describe the three inhibition types of <b>enzyme</b> reaction <b>kinetics.</b> Background There is no simple theory of non-linear saturation kinet-ics. All the available models are either purely empirical, or they rely on assumptions and conditions in whose absence any given approach becomes very complicated...|$|R
5|$|<b>Enzyme</b> <b>kinetics</b> is the {{investigation}} of how enzymes bind substrates {{and turn them into}} products. The rate data used in kinetic analyses are commonly obtained from enzyme assays. In 1913 Leonor Michaelis and Maud Leonora Menten proposed a quantitative theory of <b>enzyme</b> <b>kinetics,</b> which is referred to as Michaelis–Menten kinetics. The major contribution of Michaelis and Menten was to think of enzyme reactions in two stages. In the first, the substrate binds reversibly to the enzyme, forming the enzyme-substrate complex. This is sometimes called the Michaelis-Menten complex in their honor. The enzyme then catalyzes the chemical step in the reaction and releases the product. This work was further developed by G. E. Briggs and J. B. S. Haldane, who derived kinetic equations that are still widely used today.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>enzyme</b> <b>kinetics</b> studies {{concentrate}} on this initial, approximately linear part of enzyme reactions. However, {{it is also}} possible to measure the complete reaction curve and fit this data to a non-linear rate equation. This way of measuring enzyme reactions is called progress-curve analysis. This approach is useful as an alternative to rapid kinetics when the initial rate is too fast to measure accurately.|$|E

Treatment of intact mitochondria with trypsin and insoluble trypsin localizes these enzymes to the cytosol-facing surface of their respective membranes.

40|$|AbstractThe Na+,K+-ATPase is {{accepted}} {{as an important}} source of heat generation (thermogenesis) in animals. Based on information gained on the <b>kinetics</b> of the <b>enzyme's</b> partial reactions we consider via computer simulation whether modifications to the function of the combined Na+,K+-ATPase/plasma membrane complex system could lead to an increased body temperature, either through the course of evolution or during an individual's lifespan. The <b>enzyme's</b> <b>kinetics</b> must be considered because it is the rate of heat generation which determines body temperature, not simply the amount of heat per enzymatic cycle. The results obtained indicate that a decrease in thermodynamic efficiency of the Na+,K+-ATPase, which could come about by Na+ substituting for K+ on the enzyme's extracellular face, could not account for increased thermogenesis. The only feasible mechanisms are an increase in the enzyme's expression level or an increase in its ion pumping activity. The major source of Na+,K+-ATPase-related thermogenesis (72 % of heat production) is found to derive from passive Na+ diffusion into the cell, which counterbalances outward Na+ pumping to maintain a constant Na+ concentration gradient across the membrane. A simultaneous increase in both Na+,K+-ATPase activity and the membrane's passive Na+ permeability could promote a higher body temperature...|$|R
40|$|Functional proteomic {{profiling}} {{can help}} identify targets for disease diagnosis and therapy. Available methods {{are limited by}} the inability to profile many functional properties measured by <b>enzymes</b> <b>kinetics.</b> The functional proteomic profiling approach proposed here seeks to overcome such limitations. It begins with surface-based proteome separations of tissue/cell-line extracts, using SeraFILE, a proprietary protein separations platform. Enzyme kinetic properties of resulting subproteomes are then characterized, and the data integrated into proteomic profiles. As a model, SeraFILE-derived subproteomes of cyclic nucleotide-hydrolyzing phosphodiesterases (PDEs) from bovine brain homogenate (BBH) and rat brain homogenate (RBH) were characterized for cAMP hydrolysis activity in the presence (challenge condition) and absence of cGMP. Functional profiles of RBH and BBH were compiled from the enzyme activity response to the challenge condition {{in each of the}} respective subproteomes. Intersample analysis showed that comparable profiles differed in only a few data points, and that distinctive subproteomes can be generated from comparable tissue samples from different animals. These results demonstrate that the proposed methods provide a means to simplify intersample differences, and to localize proteins attributable to sample-specific responses. It can be potentially applied for disease and nondisease sample comparison in biomarker discovery and drug discovery profiling...|$|R

40|$|Food thermal {{processing}} {{conditions can}} be optimized {{in terms of}} final product quality retention. This optimization is possible due {{to the difference between}} the temperature dependence of quality factors and microorganisms or <b>enzymes</b> <b>kinetics</b> of thermal degradation or inactivation, respectively. All the available research in this field assume first order degradation kinetics for the quality parameters. In this work the effect of reaction type kinetics on optimal thermal processing conditions and final quality retention is analyzed. Zero, second and reversible first order kinetics are taken into consideration. Assuming that the Arrhenius model is applicable, the main conclusion is that the reaction type kinetics does not have influence on constant optimal thermal processing temperatures for maximizing the final surface product quality retention. Optimal conditions for maximizing volume average quality retention are affected by the reaction quality thermal degradation kinetics and the differences between optimal constant temperatures depend on the kinetic parameters values and processing conditions and requirements. For reversible first order degradation kinetics, final quality retentions are analyzed as a function of processing conditions and kinetic parameters and the calculation of optimal processing conditions is discussed.
