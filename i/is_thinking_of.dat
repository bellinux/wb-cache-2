500|$|During {{the conference}} room scene, Michael asks if anyone has seen the 1997 film Titanic. Pam and Jim pretend that they've {{never heard of the}} movie, and Pam {{suggests}} that Michael <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> the 1990 movie The Hunt for Red October. Upon boarding, Michael soon stands {{at the front of the}} boat and yells, [...] "I'm the king of the world!" [...] in reference to the famous scene in Titanic.|$|E
500|$|The {{pilot is}} meant to be the [...] "template of the series". Kitsis {{confirmed}} that every week will contain flashbacks between both worlds, as they [...] "love the idea of going back and forth and informing what the character is missing in their life." [...] The writers' desire to present a [...] "mash up" [...] of many small characters can be seen in a scene of the pilot, {{in which there is a}} war council featuring Geppetto, Pinocchio, and Grumpy. Horowitz elaborated, [...] "One of the fun things for us coming up with these stories <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> ways these different characters can interact in ways they never have before." ...|$|E

[...] Brown <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> his girlfriend (played by Shannon Elizabeth) before the apocalypse occurs, which is characterized by land fissures, buildings toppling down and fiery scenery. Brown searches for his love interest who is then hit by the car that Bieber's girlfriend is in. Brown saves her by leaping over the fissure. Near {{the end of the}} video, Bieber's girlfriend finds him on top of the roof of a building and it ends with them reuniting and kissing.

The video was nominated for International Artist Video of the Year at the 2012 MuchMusic Video Awards.|$|E
500|$|Flashforwards {{show that}} Hurley is famous {{as one of}} the [...] "Oceanic Six" [...] after his escape from the island and is keeping quiet about his time there. [...] Hurley {{encounters}} an apparition of Charlie. [...] Shocked, he speeds away in his Camaro and is apprehended by Los Angeles police. [...] Hurley is interrogated by Ana Lucia Cortez's (Michelle Rodriguez) former partner Detective [...] "Big" [...] Mike Walton (Michael Cudlitz) and he lies that he has no knowledge of Ana Lucia. [...] Hurley, looking at the interrogation room's mirror glass, imagines seeing Charlie swimming in water until he breaks the glass and floods the room. [...] Hurley willingly returns to the Santa Rosa Mental Health Institution, where he is visited by Matthew Abaddon (Lance Reddick), who claims to be an attorney for Oceanic Airlines. [...] When Abaddon fails to supply a business card, he asks if they are still alive before stealthily exiting. [...] An apparition of Charlie appears who tells Hurley that [...] "they" [...] need him. [...] Finally, Hurley is visited by Jack, who <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> growing a beard. [...] Jack confirms that Hurley will not reveal the Oceanic Six's secrets. [...] Hurley apologizes for going with Locke and insists that they return to the island, but Jack refuses (which shows that these flashforwards occur before Jack's flashforwards).|$|E

2500|$|Linguist John McWhorter stated, [...] "Lol {{is being}} used in a {{particular}} way. It's a marker of empathy. It's a marker of accommodation. We linguists call things like that pragmatic particles…" [...] Pragmatic particles are the words and phrases utilized to alleviate the awkward areas in casual conversation, such as oh in [...] "Oh, I don’t know" [...] and uh when someone <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> something to say.

2500|$|However, {{the origin}} of the [...] "Deacon" [...] {{nickname}} appears to date back to 1896. [...] In February of that year, The Sporting Life, a national baseball newspaper, reported a dispatch from Michigan that McGuire [...] "has experienced religion at a revival meeting and <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> giving up baseball and devote his time to preaching, perhaps." [...] The Sporting Life closed with this observation: [...] " [...] If Mac felt bent on doing missionary work his duty is to remain right where he is. But he will be back next April doing just as brilliant work behind the bat as last year. He will have no redress, however, if he is addressed hereafter as 'Deacon' McGuire." ...|$|E
2500|$|Moore-Bick {{is seen as}} aloof {{and lacking}} empathy; he {{concerned}} residents by suggesting only the technical causes of the fire would be investigated. Dent Coad said she still had less than “total confidence” in Moore-Bick, but “we {{have to work with}} the system we have, unfortunately.” Sources close to the inquiry suggest Moore-Bick <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> proposing an advisory panel. He is also inclined to recommend a two-stage inquiry: the first stage investigating the immediate causes of the fire, the second investigating broader issues over a longer period. Dent Coad said there must be a legal commitment to a second stage. [...] "We need to look at all the broader issues. One of the concerns about a two part inquiry – like with Hillsborough – is if it’s held off for too long and then it doesn’t happen at all, so that's a concern." [...] Dent Coad wants the first stage to, “look at accountability and recommendations straight away so that the things that have become most obvious throughout the inquiry are put into action straight away." ...|$|E

6000|$|But you {{stated that}} {{there was much more}} {{interest}} taken in the intellectual developments of the working classes in foreign countries than in England?--Yes; but I <b>was</b> not <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> Switzerland or <b>of</b> Zurich.
