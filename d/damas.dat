But according to French historian Aristid Martinien, at least 460 French officers (known by name) were killed in battle. In total, the Grande Armée lost 1,928officers dead and wounded, including 49generals.

Simplified algorithm of dynamic resource allocation presented which is equivalent for both inside Network Control Center (NCC) and on-board implementations of <b>DAMA.</b> Realization of algorithm is based on information about transmission buffers load of each terminal station. Experimental part. Imitation model of return satellite channel with <b>DAMA</b> was developed and tested. Average buffers load and performance of channel level were chosen as characteristics to compare systems with NCC and on-board <b>DAMA</b> implementation. These characteristics were measured for different available return channel capacity. Conclusions.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{phenomenon}} of discharge against medical advice (<b>DAMA)</b> among pediatric patients places pediatricians in a dilemma between {{respect for the}} parent’s decision {{and the desire to}} provide complete care for the vulnerable child-patient. Little has been written about factors that affect a pediatrician’s decision to allow a parent to discharge his child against medical advice. This qualitative study aims to answer the question of how pediatric residents in a tertiary government hospital perceive and decide on a <b>DAMA</b> request from a parent or primary caregiver. Methods Using a focus group discussion approach, 11 pediatric residents from a government-run tertiary hospital were recruited for the study. The session was digitally recorded and dominant themes were coded and identified. Results There were three prominent themes that arose in the discussion: variability of definitions of <b>DAMA,</b> factors considered before “allowing” the patient to be <b>DAMA,</b> and the implications of a <b>DAMA</b> request on their performance as pediatricians. Definitions vary from one resident to another based on the main reason for <b>DAMA</b> (terminal, cultural, or financial). A conflict was noted in the definition of Home per Request (HPR) versus <b>DAMA.</b> Factors that influence a pediatrician to sign out a case as <b>DAMA</b> include: their ability {{to do something about the}} reason given for the <b>DAMA</b> request, the condition of the patient when the <b>DAMA</b> request was given, their impression of the kind of care that the parents provide, and their legal liabilities. Pediatric residents generally maintain a positive attitude towards the parents who request for <b>DAMA</b> and in the event of readmission, accept the patient into their care again. The occurrence of a variety of definitions and subcategories for <b>DAMA</b> may cause confusion among the pediatricians and should be clarified. The familiarity with cultural traditions contributes to their ability to handle situations that may lead to <b>DAMA</b> but this should always be considered in the context of the pediatrician’s legal liabilities. The attitude of being helpful in spite of readmission after <b>DAMA</b> is an important attribute to be encouraged among new trainees. Conclusion In most reviews about the {{phenomenon of}} <b>DAMA,</b> patient characteristics have been identified that make them prone to request for <b>DAMA</b> however; physicians also experience a complex process of decision-making in <b>DAMA</b> situations. It is therefore vital for every training institution to include ethical, legal and moral aspects of learning into their training programs especially in dealing with cases of <b>DAMA.</b> </p...|$|R
