50|$|The oil {{shortage}} following the Suez Crisis and Hawthorne's interest in energy matters {{led to his}} invention and development of <b>Dracone</b> flexible barges for transporting oil, fresh water, or other liquids. (The name <b>Dracone</b> is allegedly a reference to Frank Herbert's Dragon in the Sea science fiction novel which featured this kind of tanker.) Hawthorne was active on many committees and advisory bodies concerned with energy matters, in particular the Advisory Council on Energy Conservation, {{of which he was}} chairman from its inception in 1974.|$|E

50|$|He was slowest among {{drivers who}} logged a {{qualifying}} time at Mid-Ohio but started 23rd on the 27 car grid due {{to being in}} the same group as Milka Duno who elected not to participate in qualifying and Graham Rahal who was penalized. <b>Dracone</b> finished the race 3 laps down in 22nd place. He started last at Infineon, despite being a second quicker than Duno. The race saw <b>Dracone</b> spin off track close to the finish and he was credited with 20th place. He finished 37th in the championship.|$|E
50|$|The {{technology}} of the submarines towing large bags filled with the surreptitiously pumped oil described in the books {{may have been an}} inspiration for the invention called the <b>Dracone</b> for which development started in the year following Herbert's serial.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Dracone</b> Barge {{is a large}} {{flexible}} watertight tube {{intended to}} carry a liquid cargo while towed mostly-submerged behind a ship. One large current example of the type has a capacity of 935 cubic metres (4.23m diameter, 91m long) while weighing only 6.5 tonnes empty.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is notable}} {{as one of}} only two known {{instances}} of a historical map actually using the phrase HC SVNT DRACONES (in Latin hic sunt <b>dracones</b> means [...] "here are dragons".) ...|$|R
5000|$|The draco ("dragon" [...] or [...] "serpent", plural <b>dracones)</b> was a {{military}} standard of the Roman cavalry. Carried by the draconarius, the draco was the standard of the cohort as the eagle (aquila) {{was that of the}} legion.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{commentators}} in Europe often grouped [...] "crawling things" [...] (reptiles or reptilia in Latin) together, {{and thus}} creatures in this group, which typically included salamanders (Latin salamandrae), dragons (Latin <b>dracones</b> or serpentes), and basilisks (Latin basilisci), were often associated, as in Conrad Lycosthenes' Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon of 1557.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, Carlos Huertas {{made his}} return to the No. 18 car and rookie Francesco <b>Dracone</b> drove the No. 19 in the first few races of the season. In May 2015, it was {{announced}} that Huertas had an ear problem and could not continue racing for the season. It was also announced that <b>Dracone</b> was released from the team. Pippa Mann then drove the rest of the oval races for the season in the No. 18 car and Rodolfo González drove the rest of the road courses {{for the remainder of the}} season in that car. After Francesco Dracone's release from the No. 19, James Davison drove the car in the Indianapolis 500 and 2013 rookie Tristan Vautier drove the No. 19 for the remainder of the season.|$|E
50|$|On 24 February 2012, the Conquest Endurance racing team {{announced}} Plowman, David Heinemeier Hansson, and Francesco <b>Dracone</b> as co-drivers for the team's {{brand new}} {{entry in the}} LMP2 division of the American LeMans Series for the 2012 season. The number 37 Judd-powered, Morgan-badged car debuted at the 60th Anniversary running of the 12 Hours of Sebring on 17 March 2012. The team finished 3rd in the ALMS P2 class (44th overall), despite having to replace <b>Dracone</b> with Jan Heylen just 12 hours before the race due to illness. On 10 April 2012, the team announced a partnership with Nissan North America to supply engines for the No. 37 car {{for the remainder of}} the season, beginning at the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach. Plowman and Heinemeier Hansson achieved their first P2 class pole and victory (3rd place overall) at the Grand Prix of Mosport on 22 July 2012. This was also the first victory for the Conquest Endurance team in ALMS competition.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Dracone</b> Barge {{was invented}} in 1956 by Professor William Hawthorne as {{a new type of}} oil tanker. The intent was to create an {{improved}} transport technology: the long tube can be pulled by a lower powered vessel than the equivalent tanker, the cargo can be handed off at the destination very quickly, and incurs no drag cost when empty (because it can easily be taken aboard), as compared to the similar unladen to laden drag of the rigid-hulled tanker of equivalent capacity.|$|E
5000|$|The title {{refers to}} its theme {{exploring}} the unknown territories of hatred, guilt, and forgiveness, said the producer Ignacio G. Sancha. [...] "There be dragons" [...] is a shorter {{version of the}} phrase [...] "here there be dragons" [...] from the Latin hic sunt <b>dracones,</b> an ancient way of denoting in maps {{a place where there}} is danger, or an unknown place, a place to be explored.|$|R
5000|$|There is a {{widespread}} belief that earlier cartographers used the Latin phrase hic sunt <b>dracones,</b> i.e., [...] "the dragons are here", or [...] "here be dragons", to denote dangerous or unexplored territories, in imitation of the infrequent medieval practice of putting sea serpents and other mythological creatures in the blank areas of maps. However, the only known use of this exact phrase is in the Latin form [...] "HC SVNT DRACONES" [...] on the Lenox Globe (ca. 1503-07).|$|R
50|$|The {{ship has}} the {{capability}} to supply fuel and other liquid cargo to vessels using replenishment rigs on port and starboard beams and through a Hudson reel-type stern rig. When providing support for amphibious operations, Wave Ruler is also able to deliver fuel to <b>dracones</b> positioned alongside. In addition to fuel, the ship carries ammunition and other stores which can be transferred while underway. She can operate a Merlin HM1 helicopter, or other helicopters of similar size, from a hangar and flight deck at the stern.|$|R
50|$|Mario Romancini was {{announced}} {{as the driver}} of the Conquest Racing number 34 for the entire IndyCar Series 2010 schedule. Bertrand Baguette began running for the team in a second car at Barber, bringing Belgian sponsorship. The team placed both cars in the Indianapolis 500 where Romancini finished 13th and Baguette ended up in 22nd after losing a mirror early in the race. Conquest Racing planned to continue running both drivers {{for the remainder of the}} season but replaced Romancini with Francesco <b>Dracone</b> at Mid-Ohio and Infineon due to Romancini's lack of sponsorship.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, Paul Devlin, Declan Lohan and Andy Roche founded Virtuosi UK team at Carleton Rode, Norfolk {{in order}} to {{participate}} in the Auto GP. The team signed GP2 Series driver Pål Varhaug. His team-mates in the first rounds was European F3 Open driver Matteo Beretta and Formula Renault 3.5 Series driver Sten Pentus, before they was replaced by Auto GP veteran Francesco <b>Dracone.</b> Varhaug won feature race at Sonoma and reverse-grid races at Monza and Hungaroring, finishing as runner-up in the drivers' standings and bringing fourth place in the teams' standings.|$|E
5000|$|The common modern use (described in {{a patent}} {{application}} filed by BP in 1972 {{in combination with}} capture booms) is in the clean-up of petroleum spills or pollution slicks, where any small and manouevrable vessel (e.g. a harbour tug) with pumping gear mounted on it can gather up a much larger volume of liquid than it can carry by pumping it promptly back over the side into a tanker or <b>Dracone</b> Barge. A secondary, but related use, is the offloading of bilgewater from large ships that must be treated (at a shore-side facility) and not dumped directly into the sea.|$|E
5000|$|Pendragon or Pen Draig (Middle Welsh penn dragon, penn dreic; {{composed}} of Welsh pen, [...] "head, chief, top" [...] and draig/dragon, [...] "dragon; warrior"; {{borrowed from the}} Latin word dracō, plural <b>dracōnēs,</b> [...] "dragons") literally means [...] "Chief-Dragon" [...] or [...] "Head-Dragon", but in a figurative sense, [...] "chief leader", [...] "chief of warriors", [...] "commander-in-chief", [...] "generalissimo", or [...] "chief governor".  is the epithet of Uther, father of King Arthur in medieval and modern Arthurian literature and occasionally applied to historical Welsh heroes in medieval Welsh poetry, such as Rhodri ab Owain Gwynedd.|$|R
5000|$|The ships {{have the}} {{capability}} to supply fuel and other liquid cargo to vessels using replenishment rigs on port and starboard beams and through a Hudson reel-type stern rig. When providing support for amphibious operations, the ships are also able to deliver fuel to <b>dracones</b> positioned alongside. The equipment load includes cranes (for stores handling and abeam replenishment), steering and rudder gear, thyristor-controlled winch/windlasses and double drum mooring winches. Up to [...] of liquids and [...] of general solids can be carried. In addition, reverse-osmosis equipment is fitted enabling the production of [...] of drinkable water per day.|$|R
50|$|Another early globe, the Hunt-Lenox Globe, ca. 1510, {{is thought}} to be the source of the phrase Hic Sunt <b>Dracones,</b> or “Here be dragons”. A similar grapefruit-sized globe made from two halves of an ostrich egg was found in 2012 and is {{believed}} to date from 1504. It may be the oldest globe to show the New World. Stefaan Missine, who analyzed the globe for the Washington Map Society journal Portolan, said it was “part of an important European collection for decades.” After a year of research in which he consulted many experts, Missine concluded the Hunt-Lenox Globe was a copper cast of the egg globe.|$|R
50|$|Born in Turin, <b>Dracone</b> began racing professionally in the Italian Formula Three Championship in 2002. He raced in {{that series}} until 2005. In 2006 {{he moved to}} Euroseries 3000 driving for Euronova Racing. He {{finished}} 21st in points. He returned in 2007 driving for ASR and 2G Racing finishing 23rd in points. In 2008 he drove for Emmebi Motorsport and improved to 17th in points. He returned to the team and series in 2009 and improved further to 7th in points with a best finish of 5th at Monza. He also competed in the International Superstars Series season finale at Kyalami for Ferlito Motors. In July 2010 he participated in an IndyCar Series rookie test with Conquest Racing. After passing the test he signed on {{to compete with the}} team at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course and Infineon Raceway.|$|E
50|$|The {{left side}} is a {{narrative}} cycle of Christ's infancy in five scenes arranged in two registers, read counterclockwise from the top right. The two rows are separated by a band which reads: MARIA ET IOSEP POSUERUNT DOMINUM IN PRESEPIO ANIMALIU / ANGELUS APARUIT IOSEP DICENS FUGE IN EGIPTUM ET ESTO IBI ("Mary and Joseph put the Lord in the animals' manger / An angel appeared to Joseph saying, 'Flee into Egypt, and stay there"). The right {{side is a}}lso divided into two registers separated by a band of text. The top depicts Christ in a mandorla supported by two angels {{on the left and}} on the right Michael the Archangel, flanked by a cherub and a seraph, battling a dragon. The bottom row shows eight apostles in various poses, all apparently speaking. The band reads: ASCENDENS XPS IN ALTUM CAPTIVAM DUXIT CAPTIVITATE / MICAEL ARCANGELUS PUGNAVIT CUM <b>DRACONE</b> ("Ascending on high, Christ led the captive from captivity / Michael the Archangel fought with the dragon").|$|E
50|$|Conquest Racing: Conquest {{planned to}} run one {{car for the}} entire 2010 season in {{addition}} to a second car at selected events including the Indy 500. After talking with a few different potential drivers, including the team's former Champ Car driver, Jan Heylen of Belgium, Curt Cavin of The Indianapolis Star reported on December 11 that 2009 driver Nelson Philippe had split from the team since his season-ending crash last August at Infineon. Brazilian media outlets reported that Tomas Scheckter had signed for the team, as well as the possibility of running two more cars for a pair of Brazilian drivers. Brazilian journalist Victor Martins reported that Brazilian Mario Romancini had signed a full-season deal with the team, with the agreement confirmed on February 23. 2009 Formula Renault 3.5 Series champion Bertrand Baguette was confirmed by the team on March 22, 2010, beginning his season at the inaugural Indy Grand Prix of Alabama. Romancini was replaced by Francesco <b>Dracone</b> for Mid-Ohio and Sonoma, due to Romancini running into budgetary troubles.|$|E
5000|$|Uther's epithet Pendragon (composed of Welsh pen, [...] "head, chief, top" [...] and dragon, [...] "dragon; warrior"; {{borrowed}} from the Latin word dracō, plural <b>dracōnēs,</b> [...] "dragons") literally means [...] "Chief-Dragon" [...] or [...] "Head-Dragon", but in a figurative sense, [...] "chief leader", [...] "chief of warriors", [...] "commander-in-chief", [...] "generalissimo", or [...] "chief governor".  The name was misinterpreted by Geoffrey of Monmouth in the Historia to mean [...] "dragon's head", and further misinterpreted in the Lancelot-Grail Cycle to mean [...] "hanging dragon". According to Geoffrey and works based on his version, Uther acquired the epithet when he witnessed a portentous dragon-shaped comet, which inspired him to use dragons on his standards. According to Robert de Boron and the Grail cycle based on his work, it was Uther's older brother (elsewhere called Aurelius Ambrosius) who saw the comet and received the name [...] "Pendragon", Uther taking his epithet after his death.|$|R
2500|$|The largest {{panel on}} the cross (north side) shows either Christ {{treading}} on the beasts, a subject especially popular with the Anglo-Saxons, or its rare pacific variant Christ as Judge recognised by the beasts in the desert, {{as suggested by the}} unique Latin inscription surrounding the panel: [...] "IHS XPS iudex aequitatis; bestiae et <b>dracones</b> cognoverunt in deserto salvatorem mundi" [...] - [...] "Jesus Christ: the judge of righteousness: the beasts and dragons recognised in the desert the saviour of the world." [...] Whatever the subject, [...] it is clearly the same as the very similar relief that is the largest {{panel on the}} nearby Bewcastle Cross which, subject to dating, was probably created by the same artists. Below this is Saints Paul and Antony breaking bread in the desert, another rare scene identified by an inscription ("Sanctus Paulus et Antonius duo eremitae fregerunt panem in deserto"), then either a Flight into Egypt or perhaps a Return from Egypt, and at the bottom a scene too worn to decipher, which may have been a Nativity of Christ.|$|R
5000|$|Although several early maps, {{such as the}} Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, have {{illustrations}} of mythological creatures for decoration, the phrase itself is an anachronism. There are just two known historical uses of this phrase in the Latin form [...] "HC SVNT DRACONES" [...] (i.e. hic sunt <b>dracones,</b> 'here are dragons'). One is on the Hunt-Lenox Globe (c. 1503-07), on which the term appeared around {{the east coast of}} Asia. This might be related to the Komodo dragons on the Indonesian islands, tales of which were quite common throughout East Asia. The other appearance of the term is on a globe engraved on two conjoined halves of ostrich eggs, dated to 1504. Earlier maps contain a variety of references to mythical and real creatures, but the Lenox Globe and the egg globe are the only known surviving maps to bear this phrase. Furthermore, the two maps may be closely linked: an investigation of the egg globe performed by collector Stefaan Missinne concluded that the Hunt-Lenox Globe is in fact a cast of it."'Here be dragons,' is a very interesting sentence," [...] said Thomas Sander, editor of the Portolan, the journal of the Washington Map Society. [...] "In early maps, you would see images of sea monsters; {{it was a way to}} say there's bad stuff out there." ...|$|R
5000|$|A small {{antechamber}} next to {{the salon}} has a frieze and vault is decorated with more personifications of virtue, and leads to the Cardinal's Bedroom, which was constructed in 1576. The bedroom walls were originally covered with leather painted with gold and silver. The coffered wooden ceiling is the most notable feature of the room, gilded and painted with the Este crest. an eagle surrounded by quince branches, a bishop's hat and the motto of the Este family, ab insomnia non custodita <b>dracone,</b> a verse from Ovid referring to the dragon guarding the gardens of the Hesperides. Feminine figures representing different aspects of virtue occupy {{the corners of the}} room. The private apartment is completed by a library and by a small chapel, whose walls are decorated with frecoes of mixture of classical and Christian symbolism, Sibyls and of prophets, and whose ceiling vault features a fresco of the coronation of the Virgin Mary. [...] The apartment also connects by doorways with Pirro Ligorio's classical Gran Loggia on the garden facade of the house, based on the terrace below and designed {{in the form of a}} great triumphal arch.|$|E
5000|$|One such barge {{is called}} the <b>Dracone</b> Barge invented in 1956. Other similar devices are the Spragg Bag invented in the 1980s, the water bag {{proposed}} by Nordic Water Supply in the late 1990s and the more recent REFRESH modular waterbag, developed in the 2010s. Terry Spragg of Manhattan Beach, California, builds flexible fabric barges for the transportation of bulk fresh water and {{is the reason why}} his product {{is referred to as the}} [...] "Spragg Bag." [...] In the 1970s Spragg was a promoter of icebergs as a large source of fresh water, but soon realized this was impractical. He then put his skills into developing the waterbag technology starting in the 1980s. Spragg has worked on and perfected this over the last twenty years with his associates. The first field test of his waterbag was in December 1990. The waterbag was 75 m long and it contained approximately 3000 m3 gal of fresh water. It was towed from the Port Angeles harbor in the state of Washington. Another test was done in 1996 with a 100 mi voyage from Port Angeles to Seattle, Washington. This test ended on April 29 when the fabric of one of the two bags under tow developed a tear. Spragg says that his next goal is to run another test voyage demonstration between Northern and Southern California and a demonstration of the waterbag technology in the Middle East as well as around the world. There are various reasons why it has been difficult to gain support for demonstrating the viability of waterbag technology in California and around the world. Spragg claims when two waterbags pass underneath the Golden Gate Bridge for the first time in history the media will let the whole world know about it. A novel, Water, War, and Peace, has been completed that details the solutions waterbag technology offers to the complex political problems surrounding water issues throughout the Middle East, the United States, and the world.The Norwegian company Nordic Water Supply developed a 10.800 m3 bag in 1997 under an agreement with the Turkish government to transport freshwater to Northern Cyprus. Within two years at least 7 million m3 of water had to be delivered annually at a cost of €2.7M per year, with volumes growing over time, but the actual transport only amounted to 4 million m3 in four years and the contract was discontinued by Turkish authorities. As a result, NWS went out of business and was de-listed from the Oslo Stock Exchange in 2003. NSW's waterbag technology was acquired by the Monohakobi Institute of Technology in Japan.The REFRESH waterbag was developed by a consortium of companies and research institutes from Greece, Spain, Italy, Turkey and the Czech Republic within two European FP7 projects, REFRESH (running from 2010 to 2012) and the follow-up XXL-REFRESH (running from 2013 to 2015). The first project was focused on validation of the concept of modular waterbag; it developed a small scale prototype of 200 m3 capacity, tested in Greece in 2012. The second project was focused on scale-up and partial redesign of the REFRESH system. At the end of the second project the REFRESH waterbag concept reached commercial scale and a 2500 m3 system made of five 500m3 modules was tested offshore Spain in 2015. The length of the waterbag was 60 m long.|$|E
40|$|Wave-profiling {{wave energy}} converters, {{typically}} {{in the form}} of a long articulated raft lying perpendicular to the wave crests, are one of the oldest concepts in this field, yet still one of the most promising. This paper considers two radical design options. Both depart from existing technology, but may offer attractive economics in the long term. The first is a development of the first author’s “buckling raft”, tested at model scale 25 years ago (Farley 1982). It addresses the survivability and cost issues in the light of modern developments in offshore engineering. It is a radical design, which makes extensive used use of concrete and rubber. The second is even more radical, being an all-rubber design like a <b>dracone.</b> The articulations are eliminated, and power is extracted instead from internal pressure fluctuations, which are amplified by the propagation of “bulge waves ” along the device. Energy is stored as elastic energy in the <b>dracone</b> fabric, rather than the potential energy of a conventional raft. Attention is also drawn to the fundamental mathematical question of the existence of linear solutions in cylinders in head seas (Ursell, 1968), and the possible existence of trapped modes (Porter and Evans, 1998). 1...|$|E
6000|$|Whilst Harry's love {{of battle}} has {{led him to}} smell powder--to rush upon reluctantes <b>dracones,</b> and to carry wounded comrades out of fire, George has been {{pursuing}} an amusement much more peaceful and delightful to him; penning sonnets to his mistress's eyebrow, mayhap; pacing in the darkness under her window, and watching the little lamp which shone upon her in her chamber; finding all sorts of pretexts for sending little notes which don't seem to require little answers, but get them; culling bits out of his favourite poets, and flowers out of Covent Garden for somebody's special adornment and pleasure; walking to St. James's Church, singing very likely {{out of the same}} Prayer-book, and never hearing one word of the sermon, so much do other thoughts engross him; being prodigiously affectionate to all Miss Theo's relations--to her little brother and sister at school; to the elder at college; to Miss Hetty, with whom he engages in gay passages of wit; and to mamma, who is half in love with him herself, Martin Lambert says; for if fathers are sometimes sulky at the appearance of the destined son-in-law, is it not a fact that mothers become sentimental and, as it were, love their own loves over again? ...|$|R
2500|$|This {{interpretation}} has {{met with}} considerable acceptance, though the matter cannot be regarded as settled. A small number of other examples of the new subject have been advanced, most from before about 1200, though the clearest is in a 14th-century Catalan full-page miniature (BnF, Ms. Lat. 8846) which shows a Temptation of Christ followed by a scene which seems unmistakably to show lions, bears and deer sitting peacefully in pairs as they are blessed by Christ. [...] The inscription round {{the image on the}} Ruthwell Cross, for which no direct source is known, reads: [...] "IHS XPS iudex aequitatis; bestiae et <b>dracones</b> cognoverunt in deserto salvatorem mundi" [...] - [...] "Jesus Christ: the judge of righteousness: the beasts and dragons recognised in the desert the saviour of the world". The new interpretation would only apply to the two Anglo-Saxon crosses among the examples mentioned here; works such as the Ravenna mosaic and the Carolingian book-covers are not claimed to show it. [...] Other Anglo-Saxon pieces might represent it, for example, according to Leslie Webster a brooch in Ludlow Museum from the 2nd quarter of the 7th century with two beast heads {{at the foot of a}} cross [...] "must also represent Creation's adoration of the risen Christ" [...] Schapiro saw the [...] "peaceful" [...] image as the original version, its composition later turned into the [...] "militant" [...] version, probably after the Constantinian conversion, but surviving in a small trickle of examples, especially those produced in contexts of monastic asceticism, showing [...] "Christ as the ideal monk".|$|R
6000|$|If Ethel had {{not wanted}} to see him, would she have come?

It is not with this I quarrel especially. My fair young readers, who have seen a half-dozen of seasons, can you call to mind the time when you had such a friendship for Emma Tomkins, that you were always at the Tomkins's, and notes were constantly passing between your house and hers? When her brother, Paget Tomkins, returned to India, did not your intimacy with Emma fall off? If your younger sister is not in the room, I know you will own as much to me. I think you are always deceiving yourselves and other people. I think the motive you put forward is very often not the real one; though you will confess, neither to yourself, nor to any human being, what the real motive is.
