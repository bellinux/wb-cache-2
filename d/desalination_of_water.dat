2500|$|A {{thermal power}} station is a power station in which heat energy is {{converted}} to electric power. [...] In most of the {{places in the world}} the turbine is steam-driven. Water is heated, turns into steam and spins a steam turbine which drives an electrical generator. After it passes through the turbine, the steam is condensed in a condenser and recycled to where it was heated; this is known as a Rankine cycle. The greatest variation in the design of {{thermal power station}}s is due to the different heat sources; fossil fuel dominates here, although nuclear heat energy and solar heat energy are also used. Some prefer to use the term energy center because such facilities convert forms of heat energy into electrical energy. Certain thermal power stations also are designed to produce heat energy for industrial purposes, or district heating, or <b>desalination</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> in addition to generating electrical power.|$|E

50|$|The region, {{which is}} far away from central Israel, is not {{connected}} to the national water supply system. Instead, the drinking and irrigation water is derived from <b>desalination</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> from the Red Sea.|$|E
50|$|It {{was further}} {{demonstrated}} that {{the flow of water}} through carbon nanotube membranes (without filler matrix, thus flow on the outside surface of CNTs) can be controlled through the application of electric current. Among many potential uses that nanotube membranes might one day be employed is the <b>desalination</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A similar effect {{known as}} Vapor-compression {{desalination}} was later used for <b>desalination</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> Instead of returning the condensate {{water to the}} boiler, the hot compressed condensate is passed through a heat exchanger to return heat to the boiler, then released as clean drinking water. It {{is one of the}} most efficient processes used to desalinate water.|$|E

50|$|Brackish water {{reverse osmosis}} refers to <b>desalination</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> {{with a lower}} salt content than sea water, usually from river {{estuaries}} or saline wells. The process is substantially the same as sea water reverse osmosis, but requires lower pressures and therefore less energy. Up to 80% of the feed water input can be recovered as fresh water, depending on feed salinity.|$|E
50|$|Gypsum also {{precipitates}} onto {{brackish water}} membranes, a {{phenomenon known as}} mineral salt scaling, such as during brackish water <b>desalination</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> with high concentrations of calcium and sulfate. Scaling decreases membrane life and productivity. This {{is one of the}} main obstacles in brackish water membrane desalination processes, such as reverse osmosis or nanofiltration. Other forms of scaling, such as calcite scaling, depending on the water source, can also be important considerations in distillation, as well as in heat exchangers, where either the salt solubility or concentration can change rapidly.|$|E
50|$|Nanotechnology is {{also being}} applied to or {{developed}} for application {{to a variety of}} industrial and purification processes.

In industry, applications may include construction materials, military goods, and nano-machining of nano-wires, nano-rods, few layers of graphene, etc. Also, recently a new field arisen from the root of Nanotechnology is called Nanobiotechnology. Nanobiotechnology is the biology-based, application-oriented frontier area of research in the hybrid discipline of Nanoscience and biotechnology with an equivalent contribution.|$|E

50|$|In {{the case}} <b>of</b> <b>desalination</b> <b>of</b> sea <b>water</b> or in Zero Liquid Discharge plants, the reverse purpose applies; {{evaporation}} removes the desirable drinking {{water from the}} undesired solute/product, salt.|$|R
50|$|This {{geometrical}} {{design is}} comparable to the flow-by mode with the inclusion of membranes in front of both electrodes, but instead of having solid electrodes, a carbon suspension (slurry) flows between the membranes and the current collector. A potential difference is applied between both channels of flowing carbon slurries, the so-called flow electrodes, and water is desalinated. Since the carbon slurries flow, the electrodes do not saturate and therefore this cell design can be used for the <b>desalination</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> with high salt concentrations as well (e.g. sea water, with salt concentrations of approximately 30 g/L). A discharging step is not necessary; the carbon slurries are, after leaving the cell, mixed together and the carbon slurry can be separated from a concentrated salt water stream.|$|E
50|$|In {{thermal power}} stations, {{mechanical}} power {{is produced by}} a heat engine that transforms thermal energy, often from combustion of a fuel, into rotational energy. Most thermal power stations produce steam, so they are sometimes called steam power stations. Not all thermal energy can be transformed into mechanical power, according to the second law of thermodynamics; therefore, there is always heat lost to the environment. If this loss is employed as useful heat, for industrial processes or district heating, the power plant {{is referred to as}} a cogeneration power plant or CHP (combined heat-and-power) plant. In countries where district heating is common, there are dedicated heat plants called heat-only boiler stations. An important class of power stations in the Middle East uses by-product heat for the <b>desalination</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{first stage}} of the LTTE {{campaign}} {{to take control of}} the peninsula was launched on 11 December 1999. The camps at Vettilaikerny and Kattaikadu on the east coast and Pullaveli to the north of Elephant Pass were taken in a joint land/sea operation. Meanwhile, the 53rd Division of the Sri Lanka Army was brought in to relieve the pressure on the 54th Division deployed in the Elephant Pass sector. The 53rd was an elite force that had been trained by the United States and Pakistan. It had a series of commanding officers, including Brig. Gamini Hettiaratchy, Gen. Sisira Wijeysinghe, Brig. Sivali Wanigaseker and Brig. Egodawela. On 22 April 2000 the LTTE attacked the twin complexes of Iyakachchi and Elephant Pass, pounding the government positions. The LTTE's veteran Black Tiger units stormed into the Iyakkachchi military base in the early hours of the morning in a multi-pronged assault and overran the well-fortified camp after several hours of intense fighting. LTTE rebels penetrated the central base, destroying several artillery pieces, tanks, armored vehicles and ammunition dumps. With the fall of Iyakachchi and the collapse of the command structure of its defending troops, LTTE combat units moved swiftly and stormed into Elephant Pass from different directions. By late evening Army Command decided to evacuate all of its positions in Elephant Pass and ordered a new defensive line further to the north. The defence establishment's decision to move the troops out of the Elephant Pass base was, however, forced on it primarily by a shortage of drinking water. The camp was equipped with machinery for <b>desalination</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> but it had broken down and not been repaired.|$|E

40|$|Many {{borehole}} {{waters in}} rural areas in South Africa are {{unfit for human consumption}} because the fluoride (> 1, 5 mg/ℓ), nitrate-nitrogen (> 6 mg/ℓ) and salinity (> 1 500 mg/ℓ) concentrations are too high. Ion exchange (IX) and reverse osmosis (RO) technology are available {{that can be used for}} defluoridation, denitrification and <b>desalination</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> However, methodology, guidelines and the economics for the use of these technologies {{in rural areas}} are not readily available. Therefore, the objectives of this investigation were to develop methodology, guidelines and the economics for the defluoridation, denitrification and <b>desalination</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> in rural areas. The capital costs of ion-exchange household defluoridation and denitrification units are estimated at R 5 000 each. Operational costs vary from R 0, 43 to R 3, 99 /kℓ depending on the feed water concentration. The capital cost of a small RO unit to produce approximately 50 ℓ/d defluoridated water is estimated at approximately R 3 000. (Operational cost R 3, 00 /kℓ). The capital cost of an RO unit to produce approximately 5 kℓ/d desalinated water is estimated at approximately R 20 000. (Operational cost R 1, 69 /kℓ). The capital cost of an RO unit to produce approximately 50 kℓ/d denitrified water is estimated at approximately R 150 000. (Operational cost R 2, 17 /kℓ).

40|$|The {{phytochemical}} {{profile of}} typical seeds from semiarid areas of Bahia was explored. The desalination {{capacity of the}} seeds discovered in previous studies considered the seeds potentially suitable for <b>desalination</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> Coals composed of crushed seeds of umbu (Spondias tuberosa Arr. Cam.) and umburana (Amburana cearensis A. C. Sm.) were prepared by heating at 250 ºC. As the desalination process using these materials involves ion exchange besides adsorption, it became necessary to study their chemical composition to check the possibility of transferring undesirable chemical species to the water during the contact between material and water. None of the tested metabolites were found in umbu coal, which enabled its use in desalination. However, the presence of coumarin and alkaloids in the umburana seeds coal indicated that this material is not suitable for that use...|$|E
