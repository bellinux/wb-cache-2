40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of Health & Wellness (H&W) tourism requires {{the presence of}} <b>dedicated</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> The main objective {{of this study is}} to analyse rural landscape as a strategic resource useful in the development of a type of H&W tourism that is not connected to the presence of <b>dedicated</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> For the purposes of this study we introduce the concept of "salus per loca amoena" indicating a range of experiences/holidays based on the medical and therapeutic use of rural landscape. This type of health and wellness tourism is ecologically sustainable, lasts between 1 and 30 nights, is able to produce both psychological and physical recoveries verified through scientific literature, and acts as a defensible competitive advantage for the destination. In this paper a review of biomedical literature on the relationship between landscape and health is conducted through the theoretical lens of the resource-based view (R-BV) of the firm. By doing so, it was possible to identify the characteristics that allow a resource such as rural landscape to evolve and become a source of sustained competitive advantage...|$|R

40|$|Grid {{workflow}} management systems automate the orchestration of scientific applications with large computational and data processing needs, but lack control over network resources. Consequently, the management system cannot prevent multiple communication intensive applications {{to compete for}} network resources, which leads to unpredictable performance. Currently, the lack of control over network resources may prevent certain applications, i. e. applications that need high capacity and Quality of Service, to utilize Grids. Hence, such applications would use <b>dedicated</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> Because the costs to build <b>dedicated</b> <b>infrastructures</b> may far exceed the cost of using existing Grids, the Grid needs to support mechanisms to optimize the interworking between networks and applications. In this paper, we present the architecture and proof of concept to control network resources from Grid {{workflow management}} system and to manage network resources from workflow-enabled applications at run-time. Depending on the current network infrastructure capabilities or future advances, applications may employ existing QoS mechanisms or use application-specific ones to provide the desired network service. We believe that our approach leads to performance improvements in communication intensive applications and enables novel Grid applications, which require optimal interworking between networks and applications. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R

50|$|In essence, iSCSI allows two hosts to {{negotiate}} and then exchange SCSI commands using Internet Protocol (IP) networks. By doing this, iSCSI takes a popular high-performance local storage bus and emulates it {{over a wide range}} of networks, creating a storage area network (SAN). Unlike some SAN protocols, iSCSI requires no dedicated cabling; it can be run over existing IP infrastructure. As a result, iSCSI is often seen as a low-cost alternative to Fibre Channel, which requires <b>dedicated</b> <b>infrastructure</b> except in its FCoE (Fibre Channel over Ethernet) form. However, the performance of an iSCSI SAN deployment can be severely degraded if not operated on a dedicated network or subnet (LAN or VLAN), due to competition for a fixed amount of bandwidth.|$|E

50|$|A Benchtop nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance spectrometer (Benchtop NMR spectrometer) refers to a Fourier transform nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} (FT-NMR) spectrometer that is significantly more compact and portable than the conventional equivalents, such that it is portable and can reside on a laboratory benchtop. This convenience comes from using permanent magnets, which have a lower magnetic field and decreased sensitivity compared to the much larger and more expensive cryogen cooled superconducting NMR magnets. Instead of requiring <b>dedicated</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> rooms and extensive installations these benchtop instruments can be placed directly on the bench in a lab and moved as necessary (e.g., to the fumehood). These spectrometers offer improved workflow, even for novice users, as they are simpler and easy to use. They differ from relaxometers in {{that they can be}} used to measure high resolution NMR spectra and are not limited to the determination of relaxation or diffusion parameters (e.g., T1, T2 and D).|$|E

There {{is no reason why}} a cooperative of drivers in a small town cannot build an app to help them beat Uber locally. But there is also no good reason to believe that this local cooperative can actually build a self-driving car: this requires massive investment and a <b>dedicated</b> <b>infrastructure</b> to harvest and analyse all of the data.
