25|$|Control-Alt-Delete, often {{abbreviated}} as Ctrl-Alt-Del, is {{a computer}} keyboard command on PC compatible systems {{that can be used}} to reboot a computer, and summon the task manager or operating system. It is invoked by pressing the <b>Delete</b> <b>key</b> while holding the Control and Alt keys: Ctrl+Alt+Delete. Thus, it forces a soft reboot, brings up the task manager (on Windows and BeOS) or a jump to ROM monitor. Control-Alt-Delete was invented in 1981 by David Bradley while working at IBM.|$|E
2500|$|The Insert key {{is mainly}} used to switch between overtype mode, {{in which the}} cursor overwrites any text that is present on and after its current location, and insert mode, where the cursor inserts a {{character}} at its current position, forcing all characters past it one position further. The <b>Delete</b> <b>key</b> discards the character ahead of the cursor's position, moving all following characters one position [...] "back" [...] towards the freed place. On many notebook computer keyboards the key labeled Delete (sometimes Delete and Backspace are printed on the same key) serves the same purpose as a Backspace key. The Backspace key deletes the preceding character.|$|E

5|$|Alternatively, it is {{possible}} to use a lazy deletion strategy in which a key–value pair is removed by replacing the value by a special flag value indicating a <b>deleted</b> <b>key.</b> However, these flag values will contribute to the load factor of the hash table. With this strategy, it may become necessary to clean the flag values out of the array and rehash all the remaining key–value pairs once too large a fraction of the array becomes occupied by <b>deleted</b> <b>keys.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{backspace}} {{is distinct}} from the <b>delete</b> <b>key,</b> which in paper media for computers would punch out all the holes to strike out a character, and in modern computers deletes text following it. Also, the <b>delete</b> <b>key</b> often works as a generic command to remove an object (such as an image inside a document, or a file in a file manager), while backspace usually does not.|$|E
5000|$|As many Apple {{keyboards}} lack {{a dedicated}} key for the forward delete function, Mac users wishing {{to have a}} dedicated forward <b>delete</b> <b>key</b> can reassign the forward-delete function to a different key using various third-party applications, such as DoubleCommand or PowerKey.

50|$|Finding a {{definition}} for warm boot, however, {{is more of}} a challenge. All aforementioned sources indicate that a warm boot is initiated by pressing Ctrl + Alt + <b>Delete</b> <b>key</b> combination; all except Tulloch (2002) mention that a warm reboot does not perform POST. Jones, Landes, Tittel (2002) specifies that for a warm reboot to occur, BIOS must be the recipient of the key combination. Microsoft Support article 102228 takes a more technical approach and defines a warm boot a result of invoking INT 19h, a BIOS interrupt call; the Ctrl + Alt + <b>Delete</b> <b>key</b> combination {{is only one of the}} ways. According to Grimes (2001), malware may prevent or subvert a warm boot by intercepting Ctrl + Alt + <b>Delete</b> <b>key</b> combination and prevent it from reaching BIOS. Windows NT family of operating systems also does the same and reserves the key combination for its own use. Soper (2004) asserts that Windows restart command initiates a warm boot, thus contradicting Jones, Landes, Tittel (2002) that believes the same action performs a cold boot.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} two topics {{related to}} binary search trees: cache-sensitive memory layouts and AVL-tree bulk-update operations. Bulk updates are also applied to adaptive sorting. Cache-sensitive data structures are {{tailored to the}} hardware caches in modern computers. The thesis presents a method for adding cache-sensitivity to binary search trees without changing the rebalancing strategy. Cache-sensitivity is maintained using worst-case constant-time operations executed when the tree changes. The thesis presents experiments performed on AVL trees and red-black trees, including a comparison with cache-sensitive B-trees. Next, the thesis examines bulk insertion and bulk deletion in AVL trees. Bulk insertion inserts several keys in one operation. The number of rotations used by AVL-tree bulk insertion is shown to be worst-case logarithmic {{in the number of}} inserted keys, if they go to the same location in the tree. Bulk deletion deletes an interval of keys. When amortized over a sequence of bulk deletions, each deletion requires a number of rotations that is logarithmic in the number of <b>deleted</b> <b>keys.</b> The search cost and total rebalancing complexity of inserting or <b>deleting</b> <b>keys</b> from several locations in the tree are also analyzed. Experiments show that the algorithms work efficiently with randomly generated input data. Adaptive sorting algorithms are efficient when the input is nearly sorted according to some measure of presortedness. The thesis presents an AVL-tree-based variation of the adaptive sorting algorithm known as local insertion sort. Bulk insertion is applied by extracting consecutive ascending or descending keys from the input to be sorted. A variant that does not require a special bulk-insertion algorithm is also given. Experiments show that applying bulk insertion considerably reduces the number of comparisons and time needed to sort nearly sorted sequences. The algorithms are also compared with various other adaptive and non-adaptive sorting algorithms...|$|R
40|$|Large scale {{distributed}} data stores rely on optimistic replication {{to scale}} and remain highly {{available in the}} face of net work partitions. Managing data without coordination results in eventually consistent data stores that allow for concurrent data updates. These systems often use anti-entropy mechanisms (like Merkle Trees) to detect and repair divergent data versions across nodes. However, in practice hash-based data structures are too expensive for large amounts of data and create too many false conﬂicts. Another aspect of eventual consistency is detecting write conﬂicts. Logical clocks are often used to track data causality, necessary to detect causally concurrent writes on the same key. However, there is a nonnegligible metadata overhead per key, which also keeps growing with time, proportional with the node churn rate. Another challenge is <b>deleting</b> <b>keys</b> while respecting causality: while the values can be deleted, perkey metadata cannot be permanently removed without coordination.
