2500|$|In the 19th century, as Ireland {{was facing}} the Great Irish Famine (1845-1849), crochet lace work was {{introduced}} {{as a form}} of famine relief (the production of crocheted lace being an alternative way of making money for impoverished Irish workers). Men, women, children joined a cooperative in order to crochet and produce products to help with famine relief during the Great Irish Famine. Schools to teach crocheting were started. Teachers were trained and sent across Ireland to teach this craft. When the Irish immigrated to the Americas, they were able to take with them crocheting.

60|$|Mr. Alan Cole's {{lecture on}} <b>Irish</b> <b>lace,</b> {{delivered}} recently before the Society of Arts, contains some extremely useful suggestions {{as to the}} best method of securing an immediate connection between the art schools of a country and the country's ordinary manufactures. In 1883, Mr. Cole was deputed by the Department of Science and Art to lecture at Cork and at Limerick {{on the subject of}} lace-making, and to give a history of its rise and development in other countries, as well as a review of the many kinds of ornamental patterns used from the sixteenth century to modern times. In order to make these lectures of practical value, Mr. Cole placed typical specimens of Irish laces beside Italian, Flemish, and French laces, which seem to be the prototypes of the lace of Ireland. The public interest was immediately aroused. Some of the newspapers stoutly maintained that the ornament and patterns of <b>Irish</b> <b>lace</b> were of such a national character that it was wrong to asperse them on that score. Others took a different view, and {{came to the conclusion that}} <b>Irish</b> <b>lace</b> could be vastly improved in all respects, if some systematic action could be taken to induce the lace-makers to work from more intelligently composed patterns than those in general use. There was a consensus of opinion that the workmanship of Irish laces was good, and that it could be applied to better materials than those ordinarily used, and that its methods were suited to render a greater variety of patterns than those usually attempted.|$|E

6000|$|This lovely Irish art of lace-making is {{very much}} indebted to Mr. Cole, who has really re-created it, given it new life, and shown it the true artistic lines on which to progress. Hardly 20,000 pounds a year is spent by England upon <b>Irish</b> <b>laces,</b> {{and almost all of}} this goes upon the cheaper and {{commoner}} kinds. And yet, as Mr. Cole points out, it is possible to produce <b>Irish</b> <b>laces</b> of as high artistic quality as almost any foreign laces. The Queen, Lady Londonderry, Lady Dorothy Nevill, Mrs. Alfred Morrison, and others, have done much to encourage the Irish workers, and it rests largely with the ladies of England whether this beautiful art lives or dies. The real good of a piece of lace, says Mr. Ruskin, is 'that it should show, first, that the designer of it had a pretty fancy; next, that the maker of it had fine fingers; lastly, that the wearer of it has worthiness or dignity enough to obtain what is difficult to obtain, and common-sense enough not to wear it on all occasions.' ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} a brief period, from 1845 to 1855, {{during which}} {{women and girls}} with no previous experience in textile design or production, initiated and produced a stylistically-unique lace. The context of the achievement is investigated to answer the two-part question: how were unskilled <b>Irish</b> Crochet <b>lace</b> makers able to create work of lasting aesthetic significance, and, what elements of their methodology are relevant for contemporary textile art practice? Primary archival and textual evidence is analysed and reveals that <b>Irish</b> Crochet <b>lace</b> is a hybrid of two styles of crochet that developed separately and simultaneously in Ireland, from different sources. Kildare makers, "of their own ingenuity", devised a way to copy old needlelace using a new, hooked, technique. Around Cork, technique allowed designs to evolve during, rather than being created prior to, the process of making. The art practice element of this thesis includes contemporary interpretations that replicate original makers' experimental approach to design, using digital software to mimic the spontaneity enabled by crochet technique. This work proposes that creative possibilities are inherent in a 'choreographed serendipitous' way of working. In this approach, experiential craft skills facilitate visualisation of what is possible {{within the limits of}} a craft, and chance effects stimulate artistic risk-taking. Using tacit knowledge of craft skills to provide an insight into creative problem-solving processes is one of three methodological bases utilised throughout the research. Grounded theory informed the extraction of pertinent facts from an extensive database of historical information, and an understanding of heuristics-based phenomenology helped effect an empathetic relationship between the researcher and the original lacemakers. Together, text and practice contribute to knowledge by revealing the bilateral sources of <b>Irish</b> Crochet <b>lace,</b> the reason for the historical success of the 'controlled chance' method, and its potential for producing creative outcomes in contemporary practice.

The business moved with the family to Ballyalla in 1898, and by 1910 they were training up to 27 girls at one time. Both ventures exhibited their work with arts and crafts exhibitions in Ireland, Britain, and America from the 1890s to the 1920s. Amongst these exhibitions were those of the Royal Dublin Society, the Arts and Crafts Society of Ireland, the world fairs in Chicago and St Louis in 1893 and 1904 respectively winning several awards. At Lady Arran's Windsor sale in 1900, both Queen Victoria and the princess of Wales purchased examples of their work.|$|E

40|$|Mestrado em Desenvolvimento e Cooperação InternacionalO objectivo desta dissertação é {{investigar}} se a indicação geográfica pode representar um instrumento de suporte ao desenvolvimento socioeconómico e humano das artesãs da Associação para o Desenvolvimento da Renda Irlandesa de Divina Pastora – ASDEREN, que trabalham com a renda irlandesa. Como metodologia, utiliza-se um estudo de caso baseado em entrevistas a três grupos diferentes de rendeiras e depoimentos de representantes de algumas instituições, públicas e privadas, que têm ou possam vir a ter interface com a ASDEREN. Fica demonstrado que as peças feitas de renda irlandesa precisam alinhar-se a necessidades e gostos dos consumidores sem perder a autenticidade e a originalidade. Capacitar novas artesãs e aperfeiçoar as habilidades das demais são mecanismos que auxiliam a actividade, apesar de não serem suficientes para garantir sua sustentabilidade. É necessário que haja maior impacto da renda irlandesa nos rendimentos familiares, do que se conclui que a indicação geográfica poderá cumprir um papel importante, vinculando os produtos artesanais ao seu território de origem – no caso, Divina Pastora (Sergipe) – e, assim, atraindo clientes interessados neste diferencial. Todavia, para alcançar resultados eficazes, as parcerias da ASDEREN com algumas instituições devem continuar, aliadas à vontade política de promover programas que fortaleçam a renda irlandesa na comunidade e auxiliem no processo de desenvolvimento socioeconómico e humano. Tudo isso em conformidade com a perspectiva de expansão das capacidades do economista Amartya Sen, na qual as próprias pessoas devem decidir o tipo de vida que desejam levar.

This work shows that products made of <b>Irish</b> <b>lace</b> need to be in line with customers’ needs and tastes, maintaining their authenticity and originality at the same time. Capacity building of new artisans and development of experienced artisans’ skills are considered mechanisms which may foster the activity, although they are not sufficient to guarantee its sustainability. <b>Irish</b> <b>lace</b> shall increase its contribute to family income; in this case geographical indication could play an important role by linking handicraft products to their place of origin – Divina Pastora (Sergipe) – and thus leading to attract more customers interested in the differentiated nature of these products.

Lace is traditionally considered a symbol of the delicate and dainty, the rich, and the feminine.
