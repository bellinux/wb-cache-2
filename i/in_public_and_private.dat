5|$|During the Brooke era, Sarawak Malays were {{predominantly}} fishermen, leading to their villages being concentrated along river banks. However, {{with the advent}} of urban development, many Malays have migrated to seek employment <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> <b>private</b> sectors. Traditionally, they are known for their silver and brass crafts, wood carvings, and textiles.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, UBS {{made its}} first {{acquisition}} in the United States, purchasing Chase Investors Management Corporation, the asset management business of Chase Manhattan Bank. Chase Investors, which was established in 1972, was subsequently folded into UBS Asset Management after the acquisition. At {{the time of the}} acquisition, which resulted in approximately US$100million for Chase, the business managed in excess of US$30billion <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> <b>private</b> pension plans, as well as various financial assets of corporations, governments, foundations and endowments.|$|E
5|$|Friends of the High Line {{has raised}} more than $150 million <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> <b>private</b> funds toward the {{construction}} of the first two sections of the High Line. Unlike the first two phases of the High Line, which the city contributed to significantly, Friends of the High Line was solely responsible for raising funding for Phase 3, which is estimated to have cost roughly $35 million. Friends of the High Line raises more than 90 percent of the park's annual operating budget from private donations. A 2012 donation of $5 million from the city was controversial since the High Line received more funding that year than most city parks did, even though Friends of the High Line raised an extra $85 million that year.|$|E
40|$|Management styles <b>in</b> the <b>public</b> <b>and</b> <b>private</b> {{sector of}} the South African economy. A questionnaire, {{consisting}} of various biographical items {{and a number of}} measuring instruments was used to determine whether a difference in management style between organizations <b>in</b> the <b>public</b> <b>and</b> <b>private</b> sector exists. A marked resemblance between the biographical profiles of managers <b>in</b> the <b>public</b> <b>and</b> <b>private</b> sectors was found. No statistically significant difference was found in people orientation in the two sectors. Managers in the private sector however, were inclined to be more authoritarian. To the degree that this phenomenon manifests itself in managerial style, a difference in the management styles of managers <b>in</b> the <b>public</b> <b>and</b> <b>private</b> sectors does exist...|$|R

5|$|A {{supporter}} of the evangelical wing of the Church of England, Wilberforce believed that the revitalisation of the Church and individual Christian observance {{would lead to a}} harmonious, moral society. He sought to elevate the status of religion <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> <b>private</b> life, making piety fashionable in both the upper- and middle-classes of society. To this end, in April 1797, Wilberforce published , on which he had been working since 1793. This was an exposition of New Testament doctrine and teachings and a call for a revival of Christianity, {{as a response to the}} moral decline of the nation, illustrating his own personal testimony and the views which inspired him. The book proved to be influential and a best-seller by the standards of the day; 7,500copies were sold within six months, and it was translated into several languages.|$|E
5|$|Public {{perception}} of the national flag varies. Historically, both Western and Japanese sources claimed the flag was a powerful and enduring symbol to the Japanese. Since the end of World War II (the Pacific War), {{the use of the}} flag and the national anthem Kimigayo has been a contentious issue for Japan's public schools. Disputes about their use have led to protests and lawsuits. The flag is not frequently displayed in Japan due to its association with ultranationalism. To Okinawans, the flag represents the events of World WarII and the subsequent U.S. military presence there. For some nations that have been occupied by Japan, the flag is a symbol of aggression and imperialism. The Hi no maru was used as a tool against occupied nations for purposes of intimidation, asserting Japan's dominance, or subjugation. Several military banners of Japan are based on the Hi no maru, including the sunrayed Naval Ensign. The Hi no maru also serves as a template for other Japanese flags <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> <b>private</b> use.|$|E

25|$|The {{rhinoceros}} iguana is {{well established}} in captivity, both <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> <b>private</b> collections. As of 2007, rhinoceros iguanas in captivity throughout the United States total 39 males, 32 females, and 36 undetermined individuals at 20 zoological institutions, with an additional 533 animals of unassigned subspecies, reported by seven American Zoological and Aquarium Association institutions. The actual number may be much higher considering animals kept at European and Asian zoos and the many kept as pets in private collections. As a result, the demand for wild-caught animals to supply zoos and the pet trade has been reduced.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{recognition}} of impacts of land development and land use practices, {{which began in the}} mid-19th century and have continued until 2006, certain actions are being considered by the Board of Supervisors of Sonoma County.

These funds could be used in flood control, hydrology modeling studies, stream conservation work, including erosion control and wildlife conservation. Other current activities include considerable research <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> <b>private</b> sectors including work by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Sonoma County and various private conservation groups.|$|E

25|$|He goes on {{to criticize}} women's social {{activity}} <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> <b>private</b> venues in Paris and Geneva, suggesting women produce the only gossip, and the moral decay of men, women and children. He states that though men have their vices, like drinking, they are far less harmful to society than women's vices. He argues that the presence and authority of women in public spaces corrupts the male youth, turning them effeminate and void of patriotic passion. Once again, the morality of Ancient Rome and Greece is frequently referenced as an ideal that should be aspired to.|$|E
