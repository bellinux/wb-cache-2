5|$|Hydroelectricity is {{the term}} {{referring}} to electricity generated by hydropower; the production of electrical power {{through the use of}} the gravitational force of falling or flowing water. In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the worlds total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity and is expected to increase about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years. Hydroelectric plants have the advantage of being long-lived and many <b>existing</b> <b>plants</b> have operated for more than 100 years.|$|E

25|$|Indian uranium {{reserves}} {{are capable of}} generating a total power capacity of 420 GWe-years, but the Indian government limited the number of PHWRs fueled exclusively by indigenous uranium reserves, {{in an attempt to}} ensure that <b>existing</b> <b>plants</b> get a lifetime supply of uranium. US analysts calculate this limit as being slightly over 13 GW in capacity.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{had very}} little {{capacity}} for manufacturing military munitions in 1939 when World War II broke out. Since the manufacture of munitions required specialized equipment and techniques there were no <b>existing</b> <b>plants</b> that could be converted. The solution {{to the lack of}} capacity was to create a large network of interlocking ammunition plants. They would be government-owned, but contractor-operated (GOCO). More than 60 plants would be constructed between June 1940 and December 1942.|$|E

25|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a {{slowdown}} of electricity demand growth. In Eastern Europe, a number of long-established projects are struggling to find finance, notably Belene in Bulgaria and the additional reactors at Cernavoda in Romania, and some potential backers have pulled out. Where the electricity market is competitive, cheap natural gas is available, and its future supply relatively secure, this also poses a major problem for nuclear projects and <b>existing</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|E
25|$|Improving energy {{efficiency}} of a {{coal-fired power plant}} also reduces emissions. For example, emissions can be reduced by upgrading <b>existing</b> <b>plants</b> or building new high-efficiency, low-emissions plants. Such plants emit almost 20% less CO2 than a subcritical unit operating at a similar load. Over the longer term, HELE plants can further facilitate emission reductions because coal-fired plants operating at the highest efficiencies are also the most appropriate option for {{carbon capture and storage}} retrofit.|$|E
25|$|One {{assessment}} {{from the}} IAEA showed that enough high-grade ore exists {{to supply the}} needs of the current reactor fleet for 40–50 years. According to Sovacool (2011), reserves from existing uranium mines are being rapidly depleted, and expected shortfalls in available fuel threaten future plants and contribute to volatility of uranium prices at <b>existing</b> <b>plants.</b> Escalation of uranium fuel costs decreased the viability of nuclear projects. Uranium prices rose from 2001 to 2007, before declining.|$|E

25|$|The {{power plant}} {{was built in}} the 1960s, when little {{opposition}} to nuclear projects was present. Over the years Beznau has been the scene of some anti-nuclear protests, but such opposition never widespread among the majority of the local population. The cantonal citizens systematically rejected all votes on early shutdown of <b>existing</b> <b>plants</b> and on building suspension of new ones. Finally, in 2007 the cantonal parliament entrusted the government to act in order to promote the building of a new reactor.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} of the Bosnia and Herzegovina has unveiled plans to build three more hydroelectric power plants with dams over 150.5 metres in height upstream from the <b>existing</b> <b>plants,</b> beginning with Glavaticevo Hydro Power Plant {{in the village of}} Glavatičevo, then going upstream to Bjelimići Hydro Power Plant and Ljubuča Hydro Power Plant located near the eponymous villages; and another, by the Republic of Srpska, at the Neretva headwaters gorge, near the source of the river. It is similarly opposed by environmental organizations and NGO's, such as Zeleni-Neretva Konjic and the World Wildlife Fund.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} renewed {{interest}} in incineration and other waste-to-energy technologies in the U.S. and Canada. In the U.S., incineration was granted qualification for renewable energy production tax credits in 2004. Projects to add capacity to <b>existing</b> <b>plants</b> are underway, and municipalities are once again evaluating the option of building incineration plants rather than continue landfilling municipal wastes. However, many of these projects have faced continued political opposition in spite of renewed arguments for the greenhouse gas benefits of incineration and improved air pollution control and ash recycling.|$|E

25|$|As of 2012, {{according}} to the IAEA, worldwide there were 68 civil nuclear power reactors under construction in 15 countries, approximately 28 of which in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC), with the most recent nuclear power reactor, as of May 2013, {{to be connected to}} the electrical grid, occurring on February 17, 2013 in Hongyanhe Nuclear Power Plant in the PRC. In the United States, two new Generation III reactors are under construction at Vogtle. U.S. nuclear industry officials expect five new reactors to enter service by 2020, all at <b>existing</b> <b>plants.</b> In 2013, four aging, uncompetitive, reactors were permanently closed.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} opinion did not question California's {{assertion that the}} moratorium was justified because {{the lack of a}} permanent disposal method for high level waste made nuclear generation uneconomic. It has been noted that <b>existing</b> <b>plants</b> and plants constructed after the Supreme Court decision have continued to economically operate by expanding current waste storage facilities. In addition, by simply citing examples of the costs of cancelled nuclear construction projects such as WNP-3 and WNP-5 or Marble Hill, or of cost over-runs at plants such as Braidwood, a state could justify a statutory moratorium on all new nuclear generating plants on the basis that these plants are inherently uneconomic.|$|E
25|$|Samawah had {{the largest}} cement {{factories}} in the Middle East during the 1970s, with a total production capacity of 2.85 million tonnes a year. These have since fallen into disrepair, exacerbating the unemployment situation, although the southern cement factory, the oldest, reopened in 2005. As of 2007, the four <b>existing</b> <b>plants</b> are producing a total of just 0.8 million tonnes a year due to the shortage of electricity. Five new cement factories with a capacity of 9 million tonnes a year are under construction {{on the outskirts of}} Samawah and will provide employment for several thousand skilled and unskilled workers as well as filling 45% of Iraq's total cement needs.|$|E

The station operator licenses of almost half the present 104 power reactors in the US, as of 2008, have been given extensions to 60years. As of 2012, U.S. nuclear industry officials expect five new reactors to enter service by 2020, all at <b>existing</b> <b>plants.</b> In 2013, four aging, uncompetitive, reactors were permanently closed.

25|$|Because {{under this}} {{approach}} land cannot be sown but <b>existing</b> <b>plants</b> can be tended and harvested, {{the approach is}} applied to orchards, vineyards, and other perennial crops. A beit din, or rabbinical court supervising the process, hires farmers as its agents to tend and harvest the crops, and appoints the usual distributors and shopkeepers as its agents to distribute them. Individual consumers appoint the court and its designees as their agents and pay monies to court-appointed designees as agents of the court. Thus, under this approach, a legal arrangement is created whereby the crops themselves are never bought or sold, but rather people are merely paid for their labor and expenses in providing certain services. In modern Israel, the badatz is notable for adapting and supervising such arrangements.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that in 2006 there was sufficient capacity to treat 52% of municipal residential wastewater. By June 2010, there were 1,519 municipal wastewater treatment plants in China and 18 plants were added each week. Many <b>existing</b> <b>plants</b> are being expanded and upgraded to include a tertiary treatment stage for nutrient removal to comply with more stringent discharge standards introduced in 2002. In terms of technologies, in 2007, the most commonly used technologies were various forms of activated sludge, including oxidation ditches (24% of all plants), sequencing batch reactors (11%), conventional activated sludge (5%) and membrane bioreactors. In small communities, plants using only primary treatment were still common (15% of all plants). An analysis in 2004 by the Ministry of Construction showed that, according to treatment plant records, most plants operated in compliance with discharge standards.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{valuation}} of a replacement project {{of nuclear power}} plants under the deregulated electricity market. The replacement project consists of two components: the decision to decommission an <b>existing</b> <b>plant</b> and the decision to construct a new plant. In the replacement project, the decommissioning decision should be made considering not only the profitability of the <b>existing</b> <b>plant</b> but also the profitability and costs {{of the construction of}} the new plant. Real options theory is used to determine the optimal timing of the decommissioning and construction. In order to examine the effect of decommissioning time and decision making one, we consider a time-lag for these decision making times. We show the dependence of the replacement project value on uncertainty and time-lag. Replacement Time lag Real options...|$|R
