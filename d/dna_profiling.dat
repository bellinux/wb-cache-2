25|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>profiling,</b> {{based on}} typing {{individual}} highly variable minisatellites {{in the human}} genome, was also developed by Alec Jeffreys and his team in 1985, with the term (DNA fingerprinting) being retained for the initial test that types many minisatellites simultaneously. By focusing on {{just a few of}} these highly variable minisatellites, <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> made the system more sensitive, more reproducible and amenable to computer databases. It soon became the standard forensic DNA system used in criminal case work and paternity testing worldwide.|$|E

50|$|The {{repository}} of <b>DNA</b> <b>Profiles</b> {{held by the}} FSL prior to the commencement of the DNA Act comprises two indices, namely a Casework Index containing forensic <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> derived from biological samples collected from crime scenes and a Reference Index containing forensic <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> of known people, including victims, suspects, volunteers and personnel. The Criminal Procedure Act of 1977 currently prevents DNA samples from being taken from convicted offenders. The <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> in the DCID are generated by analysing an AmpFlSTR Profiler Plus STR multiplex system of 9 different STR loci (D3S1358, vWA, FGA, D8S1179, D21S11, D18S51, D5S818, D13S317 and D7S820) plus Amelogenin for sex determination. There were approximately 80,000 <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> on the DCID in 2007, with the number increasing to approximately 180,000 by late 2013.|$|R
40|$|When a Y-chromosomal and a (partial) {{autosomal}} <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> {{are obtained}} from one crime sample, and both profiles match the suspect's profiles, {{we would like}} to know the combined evidential value. To calculate the likelihood ratio of observing the autosomal and Y-chromosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> combined, we need to know the conditional random match probability of the observed autosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profile,</b> given the Y-chromosomal match. We examine this conditional probability in two ways: (1) with a database containing data of 2, 085 men and (2) using a simulation model. We conclude that if the Y-chromosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> match, we can still regard the autosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> as independent from the Y-chromosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> if the matching person is not a descendant of the father of the donor of the (crime) sample. The evidential value can, in that case, be computed by multiplying the random match probabilities of the individual profiles. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
40|$|In {{forensic}} science {{it is common}} practice to work on problems where the likelihood ratio is based on observing single piece of evidence given two hypotheses. However, {{in a lot of}} cases, {{there is more than one}} piece of evidence. In this thesis three problems regarding combining <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> are discussed. First, we derived a method to combine the evidential value of different partial Y-chromosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> of different stains. The method consists of finding a lower bound for the likelihood ratio when more than two propositions are compared and where we don't need the prior probabilities of the different propositions. Second, we made a simulation model to investigate the dendence of autosomal and Y chromosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> by assuming that everybody with the same Y-chromosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> has a common ancestor and simulating the assignment of autosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> over different family tree structures. The results can be used in practice as scientific support for the assumption of independence between the Y and autosomal profile. Third, we developed a model to interpret (low-template) <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> which is able to give the likelihood of observing the <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> given any allele-combination of the donor. This model assumes that a <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> is a result of a stochastic process where the input are the alleles of a possible donor. This model uses the information in peak heights without using any threshold. The model shows promising results in determining the combined evidential value of several low template <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> that were obtained from the same stain.

25|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> is most {{commonly}} used as a forensic technique in criminal investigations to identify an unidentified person or whose identity needs to be confirmed, or to place a person {{at a crime scene}} or to eliminate a person from consideration. <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> has also been used to help clarify paternity, in immigration disputes, in parentage testing and in genealogical research or medical research. DNA fingerprinting has also been used in the study of animal and floral populations and in the fields of zoology, botany, and agriculture.|$|E

50|$|The law {{enforcement}} agency conducting the rape investigation can send the rape kit, {{in whole or in}} part, to the forensic science crime lab for analysis. Forensic scientists will try to develop a <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> of the assailant using the samples collected in the rape kit. If successful, the crime lab will search the <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> against <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> of convicted offenders and other crime scenes using a DNA database. For example, crime labs in the United States run <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> through the three-tiered Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), which was developed in 1990 and contains <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> at the national, state, and local level. Similarly, the need to solve sexual assault crimes in Brazil led the Forensic DNA Research Institute of Federal District Civil Police to create a DNA database in 1998 containing evidence specifically collected in sexual assault cases. DNA matches in such databases not only aid in identifying the assailant where unknown to the victim, but also may help determine whether the assailant (known or unknown to the victim) is a serial rapist. These findings eventually may be made available for use in court.|$|R
