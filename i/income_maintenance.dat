25|$|Despite the {{economic}} difficulties, the <b>income</b> <b>maintenance</b> scheme {{of the coffee}} support program, coupled with the implicit protection provided by the external crisis, was responsible for greater industrial growth. Initially, this growth was based on increased use of the productive capacity and later on moderate spurts of investment. The initial import substitution industrialization that occurred especially during World War I {{did not lead to}} industrialization; it became a process of industrialization only in the 1930s.|$|E
40|$|The {{replacement}} {{problem can}} be modeled as a finite, irreducible, homogeneous Markov Chain. In our proposal the problem was modeled using a Markov decision process and then, the instance was optimized using dynamic programming. We proposed a new functional that includes a reward functional, that can be more helpful in processing industries because it considerate instances like <b>incomes,</b> <b>maintenance</b> costs, fixed costs to replace equipment, purchase price and salvage values; and this functional can be solved with dynamic programming and used to make effective decisions. Two theorems are proved related with this new functional. A numerical example is presented in order {{to demonstrate the utility}} of this proposal...|$|R

50|$|The Social Democrats' {{social policy}} through the 1990s and {{continuing}} {{in the 21st century}} involved a significant redistribution of <b>income</b> and the <b>maintenance</b> {{of a large}} state apparatus with collectively financed core public services such as public healthcare, education and infrastructure.|$|R
25|$|In 1966 the {{coalition}} of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) fell and a grand coalition between CDU/CSU and SPD was formed {{under the leadership of}} CDU Chancellor Kiesinger. The welfare state was considerably expanded, while social spending was almost doubled between 1969 and 1975. Changes were made to <b>income</b> <b>maintenance</b> schemes which met some of the SPD’s long-standing demands, and many other social reforms were introduced, including the equalising of wages and salaries between white-collar and blue-collar employees, the continuation of wage and salary payments, a law to promote employment, and a vocational training law. Although these measures were largely due to the efforts of the CDU minister Hans Katzer, it is arguable that he would never have been able to push his programme through the cabinet (let alone envisage it) without the SPD.|$|E
25|$|The {{condition}} of the canal continued to decline, with subsidence occurring at Shipley and under the West Hallam reservoir, on Mapperley Brook, in 1879. Traffic stopped on several occasions, {{due to a lack}} of water in the reservoirs. Excessive wastage from Mapperley reservoir was blamed on Charles Pounder, the canal keeper, and he was asked to leave in 1885, but his successor was worse. A final dividend was paid on the shares in 1885, and by 1888, the canal was barely solvent, for although 35,000 tons of coal and iron were carried, generating £440 of <b>income,</b> <b>maintenance</b> costs alone were £639. The company took legal advice, and it was suggested that they should take action against the collieries, since they had been extracting coal from beneath the canal and reservoirs which rightfully belonged to the canal company. Claims for damages were therefore made against the West Hallam, Ilkeston and Manners collieries. Shipley colliery was exempt, as they had generally paid for any obvious damage caused by their activities below ground. West Hallam colliery denied responsibility, and legal action was taken to obtain the money.|$|E
500|$|After 1847 the Poor Law Commission was {{replaced}} with a Poor Law Board. This {{was because of the}} Andover workhouse scandal and the criticism of Henry Parker who was responsible for the Andover union as well as the tensions in Somerset House caused by Chadwick's failure to become a Poor Law Commissioner. The Poor Law had been altered in 1834 because of increasing costs. The Workhouse Visiting Society which formed in 1858 highlighted conditions in workhouses and led to workhouses being inspected more often. The Union Chargeability Act was passed in 1865 {{in order to make the}} financial burden of pauperism be placed upon the whole unions rather than individual parishes. Most Boards of Guardians were middle class and committed to keeping Poor Rates as low as possible. After the Reform Act 1867 there was increasing welfare legislation. As this legislation required local authorities' support the Poor Law Board {{was replaced}} with a Local Government Board in 1871. The Local Government Board led a crusade against outdoor relief supported by the Charity Organisation Society, an organization which viewed outdoor relief as destroying the self-reliance of the poor. The effect of this renewed effort to deter outdoor relief was to reduce claimants by a third and to increase numbers in the work house by 12–15%. County Councils were formed in 1888, District Councils in 1894. This meant that public housing, unlike health and <b>income</b> <b>maintenance,</b> developed outside the scope of the Poor Law. Poor Law policy after the New Poor Law concerning the elderly, the sick and mentally ill and children became more humane. This was in part due to the expense of providing [...] "mixed workhouses" [...] as well as changing attitudes regarding the causes and nature of poverty.|$|E

2500|$|The {{purpose of}} the Food Stamp Program as laid out in its {{implementation}} was to assist low-income households in obtaining adequate and nutritious diets. According to Peter H. Rossi, a sociologist whose work involved evaluation of social programs, [...] "the program rests {{on the assumption that}} households with restricted incomes may skimp on food purchases and live on diets that are inadequate in quantity and quality, or, alternatively skimp on other necessities to maintain an adequate diet". Food stamps, as many like Rossi, MacDonald, and Eisinger contend, are used not only for increasing food but also as <b>income</b> <b>maintenance.</b> <b>Income</b> <b>maintenance</b> is money that households are able to spend on other things because they no longer have to spend it on food. According to various studies shown by Rossi, because of <b>income</b> <b>maintenance</b> only about $0.17–$0.47 more is being spent on food for every food stamp dollar than was spent prior to individuals receiving food stamps.|$|E
2500|$|Working with Rockefeller and his staff, the AFL-CIO {{then was}} able to get {{national}} health insurance assigned to the committee on <b>income</b> <b>maintenance.</b> The assignment was critical to the AFL-CIO's strategy for moving federal legislation forward, for the AFL-CIO had decided (as a matter of legislative strategy) that any bill should be offered as an amendment to the Social Security Act rather than as a stand-alone law. The American Medical Association (AMA), which vehemently opposed any national health scheme for the aged as [...] "socialized medicine", was intent on stacking the Conference's committee on health with its representatives in order to block any health insurance discussion.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{theoretical}} model of higher education participation in Ireland. Utilising the Living in Ireland Survey data we model the impact of costs (direct and indirect), the estimated life cycle returns, environmental and parental influences and also household credit constraints on the higher education participation decision. We find that foregone earnings and youth employment rates {{have a negative impact}} on this decision; this suggests weaker labour markets for young people may have a positive impact on higher education participation. The insignificance of credit constraints in the shape of household <b>income</b> and <b>maintenance</b> grant eligibility from our estimations can also help draw some tentative policy conclusions. Our results also show that life cycle returns and parental educational level may influence participation in higher education in Ireland. ...|$|R

50|$|In 1975, the almshouses were self-supporting, with a {{total annual}} <b>income</b> from <b>maintenance</b> {{contributions}} of just over £700, in addition to £18.30 from the Tollemache estate at Peckforton and £20 from the charity established by the Bennions. (The contribution from the Peter Sprout charity had ceased before 1939.) On 21 March 1978, {{a few years after}} the death of Major John Tollemache, fourth Baron Tollemache, the administration of the Wilbraham Almshouse Charity passed to the trustees of the Almshouse Charities of Sir Edmund Wright, Crewe and Others, which maintained the Wright's, Crewe and Harriet Hope Almshouses, although the charities remained separate. The almshouses were renovated and modernised starting 3 June 1980, at a total cost of up to £71,500. They were formally reopened on 24 November 1980 by Dinah, Lady Tollemache, widow of Major Tollemache.|$|R

40|$|A post-keynesian macro-dynamic {{model of}} simulation. The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to present the structure and the simulation results of a one-sector macro-dynamic model that embeds some elements of the post-keynesian theory. The computational simulation of the model replicates some important features of capitalist dynamics as the phenomenon of cyclical growth, the long-run stability of the profit rate and functional distribution of <b>income,</b> the <b>maintenance</b> of idle-capacity in the long-run and the occurrence of a single episode of deep fall in real economic activity, which is in accordance with the rarity character of great crashes in the history of capitalism. Moreover, the simulation results show that a great reduction in inflation rate will be followed by an increase of financial fragility, increasing the like-hood of a great depression. As a policy advice derived from the simulation results, we can state that the Central Bank should never promote big reductions in inflation rate...|$|R

40|$|The {{tradition}} in Australia of delivering welfare benefits through the industrial relations system {{rather than through}} social insurance schemes {{has important implications for}} coverage and adequacy of important forms of <b>income</b> protection and <b>maintenance.</b> Using data from a large-scale survey, this paper examines access to two forms of social benefit: paid maternity/paternity leave and retirement income in the form of occupational superannuation. Patterns of coverage indicate that those with limited bargaining power in the labour market are more likely to miss out on these benefits. These results indicate a necessity for maintaining the coverage and level of benefits available through publicly provided schemes such as the Aged Pension. The findings also support the current push for a nationally legislated, government funded, paid maternity leave scheme. ...|$|R
2500|$|From 1729, {{a network}} of turnpike roads (charging tolls) was built: [...] "a turnpike was a {{primitive}} form of turnstile - a gate across the road, opened on payment of a toll. The average length of a turnpike road was 30 miles". Routes to and from Dublin were developed initially and the network spread throughout the country. Turnpikes operated between 1729 and 1858 when the extensive railway network made them increasingly unpopular. Turnpike roads were not as widely used in Ireland {{as they were in}} England because of the availability of toll-free alternatives, the roads built under the presentment system. Lack of traffic on some routes led to reduced toll <b>income</b> and <b>maintenance</b> was neglected. However, {{in the first quarter of}} the 19th century, mail-coach contracts increased income and the quality of turnpike roads improved. Turnpike roads were also used by horse-drawn carriage services, including the Bianconi coaches, established as a form of public transport by Charles Bianconi in 1815. By 1820, there were around 1,500 miles of turnpike roads in Ireland but this had fallen to 300 miles by 1856 when competition from the railways made many turnpike roads unprofitable. By 1858, turnpike roads in Ireland had been abolished.|$|R
30|$|The {{fact that}} only 2 of the 23 lists started on time (91.3 % late starts) was disappointing and inevitably contributed to the {{eventual}} outcome that 13 of the 23 lists overran. This, however, was not that different from contemporaneous gynaecology theatre data [6] and indeed in the early 1990 s, Ricketts [8] and Narain [9] noted 94 % and 97 % delayed starts respectively in elective orthopaedic and general surgery lists, thus showing {{that the problem of}} late starts has not been resolved in the intervening 20  years. The mean delay in starting the list of 26.67  min, when extrapolated to 23 elective sessions in our study, means that 613.3  min were “wasted”, during which between eight and nine additional cases could have been performed. Late starts therefore lead to a double loss of <b>income,</b> i.e.theatre <b>maintenance</b> cost of £ 1, 000 per hour and staff wage of £ 4 per minute in addition to the potential revenue gained from the additional cases. Interestingly, Collantes and colleagues [10] in a 2008 review of 1, 241 trauma cases, was able to reduce the late starts from 97 % to 68 % by sending for the patient 26  min before the list is due to start.|$|R
