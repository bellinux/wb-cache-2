As I felt the sacredness of the island of Maui, my mind began to ponder the similarities between ‘äina (the Hawaiian term for land), 2 and käinga (the Tongan term for relatives/kin). Both terms are based on ‘ai /kai, (to feed, to nourish). 3 Moreover, ‘äina and käinga convey the central idea that people are fed, both physically and spiritually, by two important sources of nourishment: their land and their kin. As I reflected on this connection, I began to understand my feel-ing of reverence toward this island.

60|$|It was scaring business, that three-hundred-foot {{climb up}} the sheer face of the mountain. Fortunately the rock was seamed and scarred with the wear of centuries; bushes and stunted trees grew out of countless crevices, which gave me sure footing, and {{sometimes}} a lift of a dozen feet or more on my way up. As I climbed, the eagles circled lower and lower; the strong rustling of their wings was about my head continually; they seemed to grow larger, fiercer, every moment, as my hold grew more precarious, and {{the earth and the}} pointed tree-tops dropped farther below. There was a good revolver in my pocket, to use in case of necessity; but had the great birds attacked me I should have fared badly, for at times I was obliged to grip hard with both hands, my face to the cliff, leaving the eagles free to strike from above and behind. I think now that had I shown fear in such a place, or shouted, or tried to fray them away, they would have swooped upon me, wing and claw, like furies. I could see it in their fierce eyes as I looked up. But the thought of the times when I had hunted him, and especially the thought of that time when I had reached out of the bushes and touched him, was upon Old Whitehead and made him fear. So I kept steadily on my way, apparently giving no thought to the eagles, though <b>deep</b> <b>inside</b> <b>I</b> was anxious enough, and reached the foot of the tree in which the nest was made.|$|R
