5|$|Metalloids lie {{on either}} side of the {{dividing}} line between metals and nonmetals. This can be found, in varying configurations, on some periodic tables. <b>Elements</b> <b>to</b> the lower left of the line generally display increasing metallic behaviour; <b>elements</b> <b>to</b> the upper right display increasing nonmetallic behaviour. When presented as a regular stairstep, elements with the highest critical temperature for their groups (Li, Be, Al, Ge, Sb, Po) lie just below the line.|$|E

50|$|Various {{method of}} {{inducing}} mechanical resonance {{in a medium}} exist. Mechanical waves can be generated in a medium by subjecting an electromechanical <b>element</b> <b>to</b> an alternating electric field having a frequency which induces mechanical resonance and is below any electrical resonance frequency. Such devices can apply mechanical energy from an external source <b>to</b> an <b>element</b> <b>to</b> mechanically stress the element or apply mechanical energy produced by the <b>element</b> <b>to</b> an external load.|$|R
50|$|Otto Berg (23 November 1873 - 1939) was a German scientist. He {{is one of}} the {{scientists}} credited with discovering rhenium, the next-to-last naturally occurring <b>element</b> <b>to</b> be discovered and the last <b>element</b> <b>to</b> be discovered having a stable isotope.|$|R
5|$|Additionally, The Adventure of Link {{was one of}} {{the first}} games to combine {{role-playing}} video game and platforming <b>elements</b> <b>to</b> a considerable degree. Over the next few years, a number of Japanese-made games appeared with a similar format; major titles such as Cadash (1989) closely resemble The Adventure of Link, with side-scrolling platform stages supplemented by RPG-like statistical systems, weapons, armor, magic spells, and so forth.|$|E
5|$|Although Gilbert wrote {{much of the}} {{foundational}} code for Maniac Mansion, {{the majority of the}} game's events were programmed by Lucasfilm employee David Fox. Fox was between projects and planned to work on the game only for a month, but he remained with the team for six months. With Gilbert, he wrote the characters' dialog and choreographed the action. Winnick's concept art inspired him to add new <b>elements</b> <b>to</b> the game: for example, Fox allowed the player to place a hamster inside the kitchen's microwave.|$|E
5|$|Catholic {{efforts to}} win the {{population}} countered the Protestant idea of a national church with Polonization, or nationalization of the Catholic Church in the Commonwealth, introducing a variety of native <b>elements</b> <b>to</b> make it more accessible and attractive to the masses. The Church hierarchy {{went along with the}} notion. The changes that took place during the 17th century defined the character of Polish Catholicism for centuries to come.|$|E

50|$|The {{communication}} between the Control element and the Feedback element is performed {{by way of the}} ‘Primary Path’ (see Figure 4). The Primary Path is a bidirectional path that allows for the Control <b>Element</b> <b>to</b> request a sample of the information and the Feedback <b>element</b> <b>to</b> respond.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{suffering}} over 50 percent casualties by {{this time}} and with few reinforcements, 3rd Ranger Company remained on the line, and {{was used as a}} reconnaissance element for the division. As the 3rd Infantry Division advanced, pressing gains from the Chinese, the company was used to guard a vital bridge over the Hantan River. It then massed with several combat engineers and other division <b>elements</b> <b>to</b> form Task Force Rogers. The task force then probed north searching for Chinese concentrations, but did not encounter any Chinese troops.|$|E
5|$|Due to its electronegativity, oxygen forms {{chemical}} {{bonds with}} almost all other <b>elements</b> <b>to</b> give corresponding oxides. The surface of most metals, such as aluminium and titanium, are oxidized {{in the presence}} of air and become coated with a thin film of oxide that passivates the metal and slows further corrosion. Many oxides of the transition metals are non-stoichiometric compounds, with slightly less metal than the chemical formula would show. For example, the mineral FeO (wüstite) is written as , where x is usually around 0.05.|$|E
5|$|Fightstar went on hiatus in 2010, {{allowing}} {{its members}} to concentrate on other projects. This included two folk-oriented solo records by Simpson and a synthwave side project operated by Westaway and Haigh called Gunship. Fightstar reunited in 2014 and released their fourth studio album, Behind the Devil's Back, the following year. The record added electronic <b>elements</b> <b>to</b> their eclectic sound. All four studio albums have charted in the top 40 and received critical praise.|$|E

5|$|For nonnegative {{integers}} n and m, {{the power}} n'm {{is the number}} of functions from a set of m <b>elements</b> <b>to</b> a set of n elements (see cardinal exponentiation).

5|$|Gliese 876 c is in a 1:2:4 Laplace {{resonance}} {{with the}} outer planets Gliese 876 b and Gliese 876 e: for every orbit of planet e, planet b completes two orbits and planet c completes four. This leads to strong gravitational {{interactions between the}} planets, causing the orbital <b>elements</b> <b>to</b> change rapidly as the orbits precess. This is the second known example of a Laplace resonance, the first being Jupiter's moons Io, Europa and Ganymede.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-2000s Miller joined bassist Dave Holland's band, {{changing}} {{it from a}} quintet to a sextet, and adding gospel and soul <b>elements</b> <b>to</b> the group's sound. Around this time, Miller had two regular bands of his own: a piano trio, and a quintet featuring saxophone and vibraphone. He also became heavily involved in music education: Miller was the Director of Jazz Studies at William Paterson University from 2005, and was the Artist in Residence at Lafayette College in 2008, which was two years after it had awarded him an honorary doctorate in Performing Arts.|$|E
5|$|Iron is {{the most}} widely used of all the metals, {{accounting}} for over 90% of worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools, automobiles, the hulls of large ships, and structural components for buildings. Since pure iron is quite soft, it is most commonly combined with alloying <b>elements</b> <b>to</b> make steel.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the other}} noble gases, krypton is highly {{chemically}} unreactive. The rather restricted chemistry of krypton in its only known nonzero oxidation state of +2 parallels {{that of the}} neighboring element bromine in the +1 oxidation state; due to the scandide contraction {{it is difficult to}} oxidize the 4p <b>elements</b> <b>to</b> their group oxidation states. Before the 1960s, no noble gas compounds had been synthesized.|$|E
5|$|Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon are {{obtained}} from air using {{the methods of}} liquefaction of gases, to convert <b>elements</b> <b>to</b> a liquid state, and fractional distillation, to separate mixtures into component parts. Helium is typically produced by separating it from natural gas, and radon is isolated from the radioactive decay of radium compounds. The prices of the noble gases are influenced by their natural abundance, with argon being the cheapest and xenon the most expensive. As an example, the adjacent table lists the 2004 prices in the United States for laboratory quantities of each gas.|$|E
5|$|Python has array {{index and}} array slicing {{expressions}} on lists, denoted as a, a or a. Indexes are zero-based, and negative indexes are {{relative to the}} end. Slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. The third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows <b>elements</b> <b>to</b> be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted, for example a returns {{a copy of the}} entire list. Each element of a slice is a shallow copy.|$|E
