[...] This is true for both Byzantine and non-Byzantine faults. [...] Thus, cryptographic digital signature methods are not a good choice for safety-critical systems, unless there is also a specific security threat as well. While error detecting codes, such as CRCs, are better than cryptographic techniques, neither provide adequate coverage for active electronics in safety-critical systems.

60|$|The {{explanation}} of this diversity is doubtless this, that in savage life, {{as well as}} in every other state of human society, all the varieties of human conduct and character are exhibited; and the attention of <b>each</b> <b>observer</b> is attracted to the one or to the other class of phenomena, according to the circumstances in which he is placed when he makes his observations, or the mood of mind which prevails within him when he records them. There must be the usual virtues of social life, existing in a greater or less degree, in all human communities; for such principles as a knowledge of the distinction of right and wrong, the idea of property and of individual rights, the obligation resting on every one to respect them, the sense of justice, and of the ill desert of violence and cruelty, are all universal instincts of the human soul, as universal and as essential to humanity as maternal or filial affection, or the principle of conjugal love. They were established by the great Author of nature as constituent elements in the formation of man. Man could not continue to exist, as a gregarious animal, without them. It would accordingly be as impossible to find a community of men without these moral sentiments generally prevalent among them, as to find vultures or tigers that did not like to pursue and take their prey, or deer without a propensity to fly from danger. The laws and usages of civilized society are the expression and the result of these sentiments, not the origin and foundation of them; and violence, cruelty, and crime are the exceptions to their operation, very few, in all communities, savage or civilized, in comparison with the vast preponderance of cases in which they are obeyed.|$|E

He was at his best in such an office and with the exception of Mrs. Wix the only person she had met in her life who ever explained. With him, however, the act had an authority transcending the wisdom of woman. It all came back--the plans that always failed, all the rewards and bribes that she was perpetually paying for in advance and perpetually out of pocket by afterwards--the whole great stress to be dealt with introduced her on each occasion afresh to the question of money.

She was to feel henceforth as if she were flattening her nose upon the hard window-pane of the sweet-shop of knowledge. If the classes, however, that were select, and accordingly the only ones, were impossibly dear, the lectures at the institutions--at least at some of them--were directly addressed to the intelligent poor, and it therefore had to be easier still to produce on the spot the reason why she had been taken to none. This reason, Sir Claude said, was that she happened to be just going to be, though they had nothing to do with that in now directing their steps to the banks of the Serpentine. Maisie's own park, in the north, had been nearer at hand, but they rolled westward in a hansom because at the end of the sweet June days this was the direction taken by every one that any one looked at.

Four projections (right and left anterior oblique, anterior, and left lateral) were obtained with 129 C 5 myocardial scintigraphy. Control images, taken before surgery, were compared with images taken 24 - 72 hr after coronary artery ligation. From postmortem ex amination the size of the infarct was determined and expressed {{as a percentage of the}} total left ventricle. On a standard diagram four independ ent observers marked the infarcted areas in each projection, expressed the severity of involve ment in each area, and determined overall in farction size as a percentageof the total left ventricle. A nonlinear least-squares method was also employed to derive the size of the infarct, using the results from <b>each</b> <b>observer's</b> diagram. There were positive correlations between <b>each</b> <b>observer's</b> percentage estimate and the autopsy results.

In this study, Observer 3 proved that acute myocardial infarcts can be quantified accurately from multiple scintigraphic projec tions of the myocardium, but the other three observers had difficulty in estimating infarct size. This difficulty probably resulted from the lack of well-validated criteria to aid the observer in determining the area of infarction, the sever ity of involvement within that area, or the total size of a myocardial infarct.
