Wyman and Jeff Pickner {{were both}} impressed with Torv's {{take on the}} role, with Wyman stating that it [...] "just transcended all our expectations", while Pinkner noted that Nimoy himself was [...] "the most proud and most impressed" [...] with the outcome. Actor Joshua Jackson found her performance [...] "so creepy". He explained, [...] "In the episodes, you see I can barely look at her. I think it ended up being {{a good way to}} play Peter’s reaction to Olivia, but it was born out of the fact that when that voice came out of <b>her,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> like: ‘Oh, that’s just wrong!'" [...] Pinkner confirmed in an interview with TVline that Bell's appearance would last for [...] "a couple" [...] episodes, and also warned that [...] "cohabitation is not as benign as William assumes it is", a reference to problems Bell would soon have in Olivia's body. The possessed state of Olivia has led viewers to refer to her as [...] "Bellivia".|$|E

500|$|Madonna and Bray {{started on}} the {{re-recording}} and changed some portion of the lyrics. Bray commented on the recording sessions as: [...] "I've always kind of made the rib cage and the skeleton [...] of the song already– she's there for the last things like the eyebrows and the haircut [...] She writes in a stream of mood really." [...] "Into the Groove" [...] was recorded at Sigma Sound Studios. Madonna's friend Erika Belle was present during the recording and watched the whole process. In Andrew Morton's Madonna biography, she noted {{that at one point}} of the recording, Bray was facing difficulties with the bridge of the song, as the melody thought by him was not syncing {{with the rest of the}} composition. Undeterred by his obvious difficulties, Madonna stepped up to the microphone and sang the words [...] "Live out your fantasy here with me". Bray's problem was solved; Belle remembered the experience as: [...] " [...] seemed to come out of <b>her,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> awestruck." ...|$|E
500|$|Baird's {{mother was}} struck and killed on 15 July 1958, just outside Mimi's home, by a Standard Vanguard car {{driven by an}} off-duty constable, PC Eric Clague, who was a learner-driver. Clague later said: [...] "Mrs Lennon just ran {{straight}} {{out in front of}} me. I just couldn't avoid <b>her.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not speeding, I swear it. It {{was just one of those}} terrible things that happen." [...] Baird and Jackie (aged eleven and eight respectively) were sent straightway to stay in Edinburgh at their Aunt Mater's, and were not allowed to attend the funeral. [...] They were told two months later by Norman Birch (Lennon's uncle) that their mother had died. Lennon's Aunt Harriet and Uncle Norman Birch were made legal guardians of the girls—ignoring Dykins' parentage, as he had never legally married Julia. Julia was buried in the Allerton Cemetery, in Liverpool. [...] Her grave is unmarked, and over the years its location was forgotten until it was recently identified by Jackie as [...] "CE (Church of England) 38-805".|$|E
500|$|In August 2015, Butters {{and fellow}} {{executive}} producer Chris Dingess stated that Madame Masque {{would appear in}} the season, and that an actress had been cast in the role.

And those are some pretty big boobs.'" [...] However, the producers were looking to take a different approach to the character, taking inspiration from [...] "Hollywood icons like Hedy Lamarr and Lauren Bacall". The character also does not wear the gold mask from the comics, though the show does reference this, with masks appearing in the background of many scenes featuring Frost. Ivy George and Olivia Welch portray younger versions of Cully during her time growing up in Broxton, Oklahoma.|$|E

500|$|Fellini's {{creative}} process for La Strada started with vague feelings, [...] "a kind of tone", he said, [...] "that lurked, {{which made me}} melancholy {{and gave me a}} diffused sense of guilt, like a shadow hanging over me. This feeling suggested two people who stay together, although it will be fatal, and they don't know why". These feelings evolved into certain images: snow silently falling on the ocean, various compositions of clouds, and a singing nightingale. At that point, Fellini started to draw and sketch these images, a habitual tendency that he claimed he had learned early in his career when he had worked in various provincial music halls and had to sketch out the various characters and sets. Finally, he reported that the idea first [...] "became real" [...] to him when he drew a circle {{on a piece of paper}} to depict Gelsomina's head, and he decided to base the character on the actual character of Giulietta Masina, his wife of five years at the time: [...] "I utilized the real Giulietta, but as I saw <b>her.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> influenced by her childhood photographs, so elements of Gelsomina reflect a ten-year-old Giulietta." ...|$|E
500|$|In the original, non-broadcast pilot, Willow {{was portrayed}} by Riff Regan. However, network {{executives}} requested that Regan be replaced. Willow's character demanded {{that she be}} shy and unsure of herself, and the casting department encountered some difficulty finding actresses who could portray this effectively and still be likable. After seven auditions, Alyson Hannigan was eventually chosen for the role. She was chosen {{for being able to}} spin the character's lines with a self-effacing optimism; she stated, [...] "I didn't want to do Willow as someone who's feeling sorry for herself. Especially in the first season, she couldn't talk to guys, and nobody liked <b>her.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> like, 'I don't want to play somebody who's down on herself." [...] Whedon conceived the character as introverted, saying [...] "I wanted Willow {{to have that kind of}} insanely colorful interior life that truly shy people have. And Alyson has that. She definitely has a loopiness I found creeping into the way Willow talked, which was great. To an extent, all the actors conform to the way I write the character, but it really stands out in Willow's case." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Into the Groove" [...] is {{the sixth}} track on the 1985 {{worldwide}} reissue of Like a VIrgin; {{it has never}} been part of Like a Virgin on any North American release. Madonna's inspiration behind the song was the dance floor, and she wrote it while watching a handsome Puerto Rican man across her balcony. Initially written for her friend Mark Kamins, Madonna later decided to use it in the soundtrack of her 1985 film Desperately Seeking Susan. Unlike the other songs on Like A Virgin, [...] "Into the Groove" [...] was recorded at Sigma Sound Studios, and produced by Madonna and Steve Bray. Madonna's friend Erika Belle was present during the recording and watched the whole process.

Bray's problem was solved; Belle remembered the experience as: [...] " [...] seemed to come out of <b>her,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> awestruck." [...] The song consists of instrumentation from drums, percussion, congas and whistles. Madonna's voice is double-tracked in the chorus. The lyrics are simple, and written as an invitation to dance with the singer, with sexual innuendos and undertones in the meaning.|$|E

He also has a tattoo of the singer on his back. Solange Knowles remarked on the tenth anniversary of her death that she idolized Aaliyah and proclaimed that she would never be forgotten. Adam Levine, the lead vocalist of the pop rock group Maroon 5, remembers that listening to [...] "Are You That Somebody?" [...] convinced him to pursue a more soulful sound than that of his then-band Kara's Flowers. Erika Ramirez, associate editor of Billboard.com, said at the time of Aaliyah's career [...] "there weren't many artists using the kind of soft vocals the ways she was using it, and now {{you see a lot of}} artists doing that and finding success," [...] her reasoning for Aaliyah's continued influence on current artists. She argued that Aaliyah's second album One in a Million was [...] "very much ahead of its time, with the bass and electro kind of R sounds that they produced", referring to collaborators Timbaland and Missy Elliott and that the sound, which [...] "really stood out" [...] at its time, was being replicated.|$|E

Meanwhile, his father wondered whether he could raise his son at this old age. Habib Bourguiba later described his birth in these words: [...] "When she conceived me, it was for her, the unfortunate, a catastrophe. She was already forty years old. Many of her pregnancies weakened <b>her.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> told that when she gave birth to me, she was so ashamed of having a child at that age that she stifled her cries for deliverance while gritting her teeth with a towel placed in her mouth.

2500|$|For {{the role}} of the evil Asa and her {{innocent}} descendant Katia, Bava noted: [...] "A strange type was needed, and we chose Steele from pictures." [...] Bava reportedly found Steele difficult to work with. According to Bava, the actress [...] "was somewhat irrational, afraid of Italians. One day she refused to come to the set, because somebody told <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> using a special film-stock that made people appear naked." [...] Steele recalled: [...] "Lord alone knows I was difficult enough. I didn't like my fangs – I had them changed three times. I loathed my wig – I changed that four times. I couldn't understand Italian. I certainly didn't want to allow them to tear open my dress and expose my breasts, so they got a double that I didn't like at all, so I ended up doing it myself – drunk, barely over eighteen, embarrassed and not very easy to be around." ...|$|E

I decided I had to stop, which I did when I began to worry about AIDS, which was becoming prevalent in Britain. Although I had always had safe sex, I didn't want {{to sleep with}} a woman without telling <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> bisexual. I felt that would be irresponsible. Basically, I didn't want to have that uncomfortable conversation that might ruin the moment, so I stopped sleeping with them." [...] In the same interview, he added : [...] "If I wasn't with Kenny , I would have sex with women, no question". He said he believed that the formation of his sexuality was [...] "a nurture thing, via the absence of my father who was always busy working. It meant I was exceptionally close to my mother", though he stated that [...] "there are definitely those who have a predisposition to being gay in which the environment is irrelevant." ...|$|E

2500|$|Buffy the Vampire Slayer (often {{simplified}} as Buffy) {{was originally}} conceived by Joss Whedon for a 1992 feature film. However, in its development Whedon felt it {{lost some of}} the quirkiness he considered was {{the heart of the}} project, and it was not received as well as he liked. He began to develop for television the concept of a fashion-conscious girl named Buffy, who is imbued with superhuman abilities and attends a high school situated on a portal to hell. Whedon created a group of friends for the main character, including Willow Rosenberg and Xander Harris. A half-hour pilot was filmed starring Riff Regan as Willow, but it was eventually left unaired and network executives requested that Regan be replaced. Willow's character demanded that she be shy and unsure of herself, and the casting department encountered some difficulty finding actors who could portray this effectively and still be likable. After seven auditions, 23-year-old Alyson Hannigan was hired for the role. She was chosen for being able to spin the character's lines with a self-effacing optimism. She later stated in an interview, [...] "I didn't want to do Willow as someone who's feeling sorry for herself.

2500|$|Reflecting on his childhood, Fritzl {{initially}} {{described his}} mother as [...] "the best {{woman in the}} world" [...] and [...] "as strict as it was necessary". Later, he expressed a negative opinion {{of his mother and}} claimed that [...] "she used to beat me, hit me until I was lying {{in a pool of blood}} on the floor. It left me feeling totally humiliated and weak. My mother was a servant and she used to work hard all her life, I never had a kiss from <b>her,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> never cuddled although I wanted it – I wanted her to be good to me." [...] He also claimed that she called him [...] "a Satan, a criminal, a no-good", that he [...] "had a horrible fear of her". In 1959, after Fritzl had married and bought his house, his mother moved in with them. Over time, their roles reversed, and his mother came to fear him. Eventually, he also admitted he had later locked his mother in the attic and bricked up her window after telling neighbors that she had died, and kept her locked up until her death in 1980. It is unknown how long Fritzl kept his mother locked up in his attic, but newspapers have speculated that it may have been up to 20 years.|$|E
