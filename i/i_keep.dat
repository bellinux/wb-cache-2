5|$|It {{has been}} a {{struggle}} telling this story over the years, {{because a lot of}} people don't want to hear about this kind of history. People don't relate to it, or just don't want to hear about it. But Mama told me to keep it alive, so <b>I</b> <b>keep</b> telling it... It's a sad story, but it's one I think everyone needs to hear.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the hard part would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So <b>I</b> <b>keep</b> working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E
5|$|It's {{about how}} people take drugs to connect to God or {{to a higher level}} of consciousness. <b>I</b> <b>keep</b> saying, 'Plugging into the matrix'. If you get high, you can do that, which is why a lot of people drop acid or do drugs, because they want to get closer to God. But there's going to be a short circuit, and that's the {{illusion}} of drugs, because they give you the illusion of getting closer to God, but ultimately they kill you. They destroy you. I mean, I tried everything once, but as soon as I was high, I spent my time drinking tons of water {{to get it out of}} my system. As soon as I was high, I was obsessed with flushing it out of me. I was like, 'OK, I'm done now'.|$|E

25|$|Anyway, <b>I</b> <b>keep</b> picturing {{all these}} little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around – nobody big, I mean – except me. And I'm {{standing}} {{on the edge of}} some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff – I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all.|$|E
25|$|Prigent {{released}} his second album, Me 'zalc'h ennon ur fulenn aour (<b>I</b> <b>keep</b> in myself a golden spark), in 1997. He wrote all the lyrics {{except for the}} traditional song Ar rannoù that appears in the Barzaz Breiz, {{and most of the}} musics, using both traditional instruments and electronic sounds. The subjects of the lyrics are the classical topics of gwerz : injustice, disease, death. E trouz ar gêr, about the artificial aspects of living in a city, and An hentoù adkavet, about the revival of the Tro Breizh, are his first songs devoted to Brittany, its culture and its relation to nature.|$|E

If you train them, they'll retrieve. They'll do anything to please you." ...|$|E

500|$|Widney {{attributed}} his longevity {{to living}} simply and keeping busy. At age 94, Widney advocated [...] "no liquor, no tobacco, no drugs. I'm not a fanatic on liquor, {{but to me}} it is a medicine. <b>I</b> <b>keep</b> it around and take it when I need it. But there is no excuse whatever for tobacco or drugs". He recommended at least eight hours sleep each night and short naps throughout the day.|$|E
500|$|With this video, {{we wanted}} to go {{completely}} into the dream world. A lot of my videos from 'Turn Up the Music' and other videos I'm doing now are in a dream state of believing what you want to believe. So that's what Fortune kinda encompasses. So it's basically dreaming and accomplishing your dreams. This video is me dreaming and being taken into this whole kind of maze. <b>I</b> <b>keep</b> waking up within a dream within a dream, almost on some Inception [...] type...but I don't want to bite that.|$|E
500|$|The {{strain in}} race {{relations}} {{led to the}} Singaporean 1964 Race Riots, which PAP Malay politician Othman Wok later insinuated were planned beforehand by the ultras. In the year following the riots, tension continued growing. Syed Jaafar Albar declared that [...] "Wherever I am, I am a Malay", drawing harsh return fire from Lee, who stated in Parliament: [...] "If I had been going round and saying what [...] has been saying — wherever I am, I am a Chinese — where would we be? But <b>I</b> <b>keep</b> on reminding the people that I am a Malaysian. I am learning Bahasa Kebangsaan [...] and I accept Article 153 of the Constitution." ...|$|E

500|$|Dworsky {{belongs to}} the {{generation}} of post-World War II modernists that took its cues from the 1920s German Bauhaus and the French-Swiss master Le Corbusier. In 1988, Dworsky noted: [...] "I am most intrigued by the essential mystery of architecture. For me, built space {{will always be a}} kind of theater, a stage on which life is played, and played out. That's why <b>I</b> <b>keep</b> on being an architect. Asked what inspires his architecture, Dworsky said he draws from the [...] "solid, resolved concepts" [...] of modern designers such as Le Corbusier and Marcel Bruer, while being encouraged on occasion to experiment by such [...] "new wave" [...] designers as Frank Gehry and Eric Owen Moss.|$|E
500|$|In 1845, a {{religious}} revival {{took place in}} Amherst, resulting in 46 confessions of faith among Dickinson's peers. Dickinson wrote to a friend the following year: [...] "I never enjoyed such perfect peace and happiness as the short time in which I felt I had found my savior." [...] She {{went on to say}} that it was her [...] "greatest pleasure to commune alone with the great God & to feel that he would listen to my prayers." [...] The experience did not last: Dickinson never made a formal declaration of faith and attended services regularly for only a few years. After her church-going ended, about 1852, she wrote a poem opening: [...] "Some keep the Sabbath going to Church– / <b>I</b> <b>keep</b> it, staying at Home".|$|E
500|$|After {{the second}} verse {{of the song}} begins, {{childhood}} pictures of Jared and Shannon with their mother Constance are shown. Takes of the Hollywood Walk of Fame and other confessions follow, including clips from Corey Feldman's early work as a child actor. Feldman discusses how he started working at age three and how his family relied on him to pay the bills. Ashley Olsen opines on the fleeting nature of fame, while Juliette Lewis and James Franco talk about managing dreams and expectations. As the song ends, Christopher Lloyd Dennis sums up, [...] "Do I think I'm gonna {{make it in the}} industry? As long as <b>I</b> <b>keep</b> believing, it will happen."

500|$|At his {{confirmation}} hearings in 2017, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch recalled being moved by reading Sumner's gravestone {{as a law}} student at Harvard. Gorsuch closed his opening statement by reading a portion of Sumner's epitaph and adding [...] "hose words stick with me. <b>I</b> <b>keep</b> them on my desk. They serve {{for me as a}} daily reminder of the law's integrity, that a useful life can be led in its service, of the hard work it takes, and an encouragement to good habits when I fail and when I falter. At the end of it all, I can ask for nothing more than to be described as he was. And if confirmed, I pledge to you that I will do everything in my power to be that man." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{goal was}} first proclaimed {{publicly}} in the 1937 Nuremberg Rallies. Hitler's last speech at this event {{ended with the}} words [...] "The German nation has after all acquired its Germanic Reich", which elicited speculation in political circles of a 'new era' in Germany's foreign policy. Several days before the event Hitler took Albert Speer aside when both {{were on their way}} to the former's Munich apartment with an entourage, and declared to him that [...] "We will create a great empire. All the Germanic peoples will be included in it. It will begin in Norway and extend to northern Italy. I myself must carry this out. If only <b>I</b> <b>keep</b> my health!"

It {{allows me to}} wear a mask". She lives alone and, by her own account, leads a low-key life when she's not working. When asked in an interview what people would {{be surprised to find}} out about her, she responded [...] "I guess people would be surprised to find out that I am a bit of a homebody. [...] I do not like clubbing or going to wild parties. [...] After a day of shooting, I love to come home and relax by the fire with a glass of wine and a good book. [...] Boring, huh?"

I haven’t just sat back and thought of myself or my ideas or what I wanted to do. Oh no, I’ve stayed interested in people. I’ve kept working.

500|$|Lemon's 26-year-old son, Jerry, {{was killed}} in an {{automobile}} accident in the fall of 1978, 10 days after Lemon won the World Series. The following season with the Yankees at 34–31, Lemon was fired in June by Steinbrenner and replaced by Martin, but he remained with the organization as he had a contract through the 1982 season. Speaking of Martin, Lemon said, [...] "He's a very likeable guy, a free spirit. Where maybe <b>I</b> <b>keep</b> things inside, he lets them come out. There's nothing wrong with that." [...] The Yankees finished in fourth place in the AL East (89–71). Lemon worked as a scout for the Yankees and received [...] "several offers" [...] from other teams to serve as manager. One offer came in 1979 from the Indians, but Lemon refused it as well as the others.|$|E

Guggenheim said: I've never had so much fun writing a script before ... It was such a blast to work on... <b>I</b> <b>keep</b> telling everyone that we should try for Avengers. It's these two heroes together with a big production value. ... There's the opportunity for inside jokes, and seeing all of the characters together. What happens when Cisco gets his eyes on Thea?

Kreisberg {{revealed that}} the writers' rooms for both shows were merged while working on the scripts for the episodes, similar to [...] "throwing two casts together".|$|E
