25|$|The {{capacity}} of the DM plant is dictated by the type and quantity of salts in the raw water input. However, some storage is essential as the DM plant may be down for maintenance. For this purpose, a storage tank is installed from which DM water is continuously withdrawn for boiler make-up. The storage tank for DM water is made from materials not affected by corrosive water, such as PVC. The piping and valves are generally of stainless steel. Sometimes, a steam blanketing arrangement or stainless steel doughnut float is provided {{on top of the}} water in the tank to avoid contact with air. DM water make-up is generally added at the steam space of the surface condenser (i.e., the vacuum side). This arrangement not only sprays the water but also DM water gets deaerated, with the dissolved gases being removed by a <b>de-aerator</b> through an ejector attached to the condenser.|$|E
5000|$|Condensed steam {{was taken}} from the turbine {{condenser}} and pumped back into the boiler feed system, via the unit evaporator, low and high pressure water tube heaters (after being subjected to bled steam heat from turbine cylinders) into a <b>de-aerator.</b> The de-aerated water was taken by the main feed pump (multi stage cartridge design pump or a smaller start up pump) and discharged at [...] into the boiler water feed system through feed regulating valves. Both feed pump types were electric motor driven. Additional station boiler feed water supply could also be made up by the station water treatment plant and fed into the <b>de-aerator,</b> this was operated and controlled by the station chemistry department.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} stages of H.P. feed heating with six heater shells {{arranged}} in parallel pairs, a <b>de-aerator</b> and three low pressure heaters. Steam is bled {{from the main}} turbine H.P. exhaust to drive the main boiler feed pump turbine, which exhausts to the feed heating system to improve the overall cycle efficiency. The main feed pump turbine is a 15,150 hp single-cylinder impulse machine with steam conditions, at the h.p. exhaust, of 610 psia (42.06 bar) at 366 °C. The rotor has eleven stages and the steam is exhausted to the <b>de-aerator</b> at 52 psia. (3.585 bar) at 144 °C. The pump is a six-stage centrifugal unit with a capacity of 1588 t/h (3,500,000 lb/h). Two 50 per cent duty start-up and standby feed pumps, electrically driven, are also provided.|$|E
40|$|Two-phase gas–liquid annular flows are {{encountered}} in ventless aero-engine oil system pipes. The droplet {{size in the}} flow has an important impact {{on the performance of}} downstream equipment as breathers and <b>de-aerators.</b> However, literature studies present semi-empirical models that are not in the range of operating conditions of the oil system. To investigate the effect of the use of lubrication oil on the droplet sizes, this paper presents experimental results of annular flow with oil flow rates from 160 to 640 l/h and air flow rates from 60 to 120 Nm 3 /h. Comparison of the Sauter–Mean Diameter predicted by existing correlation show an error of minimum 30 % compared to experimental values for higher oil flow rates, which are the most important in oil systems. To address this issue, correlations were adapted to fit experimental results. With the new set of parameters, the Sauter-Mean Diameter is estimated with an error of maximum 18 % for higher oil flow rates. Results analysis illustrate that the main difference between existing and new correlations could be due do the surface tension and viscosity of lubrication oil, which are very different from water at low temperature. The results are also consistent with the transition between bag and ligament break-up droplet generation mechanism at a flow rate of 80  Nm 3 /h. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|An aero-engine {{bearing chamber}} is a {{structure}} {{that is used to}} contain and collect oil used in lubricating and cooling the bearings supporting the high-speed engine shafts. There are various bearings in an aero-engine. Within the bearing chambers, there are typically the bearings, rotating shafts, seals and gears (in some designs). The walls of the bearing chamber are stationary and there are vents and sumps to take out the oil, via an offtake pipe, and the sealing air. The oil collected via the sump and vents is recycled and used again in the loop. To prevent oil degradation and reduce chance of coking in the chamber, it is desired that all of the oil goes through the recycling loop, with no oil staying longer than necessary in the chamber. The sealing air is used to maintain a positive pressure to keep the oil within the chamber. The flow inside a bearing chamber is highly turbulent and consists of a rotating mixture of oil and air. A smaller amount of the oil, mostly as oil-droplets, exits at the vents and is separated from the air using <b>de-aerators</b> [1]. It is expected that by gravity, most of the oil collects at the sump and can be easily scavenged. This is provided the sump can be large enough. The geometry of a bearing chamber is, however, complex largely because of space limitations. It is very important that oil is not resident longer than necessary to prevent over-heating and therefore deterioration or coking. Experimental observations by Chandra & Simmons [2], have shown that bearing chambers with deep sumps perform better that those with shallow sumps. Since shallow sumps are inevitable, a number of innovative studies have been done to improve bearing chamber designs. The presence of air in the oil (e. g. as bubbles) reduces the efficiency of the scavenging pump. Other factors such as oil momentum and windage can take oil away from the off-take pipe potentially increasing oil residence volume. Chandra & Simmons [2] placed inserts such as grille cover, perforated plate, etc, on a side of the bearing wall and improvements in the residence volume were seen. In this work, we are looking at a detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of one of the inserts that performed well. This will aid understanding of the flow characteristics of using an insert to improve oil residence in a bearing chamber...|$|R
50|$|The {{pressure}} system components are typically include an oil tank and <b>de-aerator,</b> main oil pump, main oil filter/filter bypass valve, {{pressure regulating valve}} (PRV), oil cooler/by pass valve and tubing/jets. Usually the flow is from the tank to the pump inlet and PRV, pumped to main oil filter or its bypass valve and oil cooler, then through some more filters to jets in the bearings.|$|E
5000|$|Another visual {{hallmark}} of the 701 was its combined oil tank and <b>de-aerator.</b> This large, cylindrical tank was mounted vertically to the right hand side of the Hewland transaxle, filling {{the space between the}} right rear wheel, the gearbox and the wing. Autocar sporting editor Innes Ireland described it as [...] "enormous" [...] and looking [...] "like an old fashioned coffee percolator". The oil radiator itself was mounted atop the gearbox, to avoid the surge and starvation problems associated with the lengthy pipes needed to mount the radiator in the nose, alongside the water radiator.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} type of {{electrode}} boiler pumps water from {{the lower part of the}} vessel to an internal header that has nozzles that allow the water to flow to electrodes. Generally the working pressure is maintained at 10 bar. If more pressure is needed (more steam) the controls speed up the pump and flow more water through additional nozzles. As the needed pressure is reached the pump controls the flow of water to obtain the desired steam output (in kg per hour) at the desired pressure. On larger systems the pump can be controlled by a variable frequency drive (VFD) so energy is not wasted. This control system can also control <b>de-aerator</b> pumps and controls.|$|E

5000|$|Kudryavtsev and Proskuryakov, the SIUR {{trainees}} {{from other}} shifts, were present to watch Toptunov and learn. After the explosion {{they were sent}} by Dyatlov or Akimov to the central hall to turn the handles of the system for manual lowering of the presumably seized control rods. They ran through the <b>de-aerator</b> gallery {{to the right to}} the VRSO unit elevator, found it destroyed, so climbed up the staircase instead, towards Level 36; they missed Kurguz and Genrikh, who used another stairwell. Level 36 was destroyed, covered with rubble. They went through a narrow corridor towards the central hall, entered the reactor hall, and found it blocked with rubble and fragments; dangling fire hoses were pouring water into the remains of the reactor core, the firemen not there anymore. The Upper Biological Shield was slanted, jammed into the reactor shaft; a blue and red fire raged in the hole. The minute the two stood above the reactor was enough to darken their bodies with [...] "nuclear tan" [...] and give them a fatal radiation dose. They returned to Level 10 and to the control room, reporting the situation; Dyatlov insisted they were wrong, assuming the explosion had been caused by hydrogen-oxygen mixture in the 110 m³ emergency tank and the reactor itself was intact.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of various parameters on oxygen stripping for a two stage spray and tray type <b>de-aerator</b> is analyzed experimentally. It is observed that increasing the {{mass flow rate}} of water leads to an increase in heat and mass transfer coefficients in both stages. There is no significant {{influence of}} <b>de-aerator</b> pressure and length of the second stage on the heat transfer coefficients in the range tested. The increase in <b>de-aerator</b> pressure enhances the mass transfer coefficient by 14 percent, whereas the increase in length of the second stage has no significant influence. The empirical correlations available in the literature predict the mass transfer coefficients satisfactorily in the experimental range tested. The total length of the <b>de-aerator</b> is a significant parameter influencing the quantity of oxygen removed from the feed water. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This {{research}} {{deals with}} techno economic analysis {{to select the}} most economic desalination method for Asalouyeh combined cycle power plant. Due to lack of fresh water, desalination of sea water is necessary to provide required DM water of Power Plant. The most common desalination methods are RO, MSF, MED, and MED–TVC. In this research, methods of RO, MED, and MED– TVC have been compared. Simulation results show that recovery of heat of exhaust gas of main stack is optimum case for providing DM water required for injected steam of MED desalination. This subject is very important because of improving thermal efficiency of power plant using extra heat recovery.

40|$|Waste heat is heat {{which is}} {{generated}} {{in a different}} process i. e by combustion of fuel, by chemical rection. The important of heat is its value not quality. The planning of how to recover this waste heat depends {{in part on the}} temperature of waste heat gases. The energy lost in waste heat can not be fully recovered but maximum quantity of heat can be recovered and loss is minimized. Generally higher the temperature, higher the quality and then more cost effective is the heat recovery. Lots of heat is lost by blow down so it is necessary to recover this heat by addition of heat exchanger in between this process. So this waste heat could be utilized to heat boiler water before going to <b>de-aerator.</b> By applying this process we can easily reduce loss of heat and heat required to heat boiler water is reduced. Also this blow down water we can utilized as feed water so consumption of feed water is also reduced. But this blow water we cant utilized as boiler water because we rejected due to high TDS. If we utilized then TDS level in boiler is increased. So it is beneficiary to use this at the starting of demineralizatio...|$|E
40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 HOLCIM has various cement {{production}} plants across India. These plants struggle {{to produce the}} projected amount of cement due to electricity shortages. Although coal is abundant in India, the production thereof is in short supply. It is proposed that a thorium HTR (100 MWt) combined with a PCU (Rankine cycle) be constructed to supply a {{cement production}} plant with the required energy. The Portland cement production process is investigated and {{it is found that}} process heat integration is not feasible. The problem is that for the feasibility of this IPP to be assessed, a Rankine cycle needs to be adapted and optimised to suit the limitations and requirements of a 100 MWt thorium HTR. Advantages of the small thorium HTR (100 MWt) include: on-site construction; a naturally safe design and low energy production costs. The reactor delivers high temperature helium (750 °C) at a mass flow of 38. 55 kg/s. Helium re-en ters the reactor core at 250 °C. Since the location of the cement production plant is unknown, both wet and dry cooling tower options are investigated. An overall average ambient temperature of India is used as input for the cooling tower calculations. EES software is used to construct a simulation model with the capability of optimising the Rankine cycle for maximum efficiency while accommodating various out of the norm input parameters. Various limitations are enforced by the simulation model. Various cycle configurations are optimised (EES) and weighed against each other. The accuracy of the EES simulation model is verified using FlowNex while the optimised cycle results are verified using Excel’s X-Steam macro. It is recommended that a wet cooling tower is implemented if possible. The 85 % effective heat exchanger delivers the techno-economically optimum Rankine cycle configuration. For this combination of cooling tower and heat exchanger, it is recommended that the cycle configuration consists of one <b>de-aerator</b> and two closed feed heaters (one specified). After the Rankine cycle (PCU) has been designed and optimised, it is evident that the small thorium HTR (100 MWt) can supply the HOLCIM plant with the required energy. The optimum cycle configuration, as recommended, operates with a cycle efficiency of 42. 4 % while producing 39. 867 MWe. A minimum of 10 MWe can be sold to the Indian distribution network at all times, thus generating revenue. Master...|$|E
