40|$|Abstract. This paper {{analyses}} {{the material}} removal and surface forming mechanism of ultrasonic auxiliary gear honing. According to the Huygens principle of diffraction, a theory is proposed firstly that the ultrasonic waves transmit through the being honed gear in toroidal form, and the mathematical equation of the abrasive trace is built that expresses the relative movement between CBN abrasive and the <b>gear</b> <b>surface.</b> The equation is accordant with the experimental result. The paper {{concludes that the}} material removal of the <b>gear</b> <b>surface</b> depends on two factors, one is that CBN abrasives scratch the <b>gear</b> <b>surface,</b> {{and the other is}} that the <b>gear</b> <b>surface</b> vibrating itself along its normal direction impacts the abrasives...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} {{concentrate}} on acetal gear wear behaviour and its performance prediction based on the extensive investigations on the gear thermal mechanical contact both experimentally and numerically. It has been found from the tests that acetal gear wear rate will be increased dramatically when the load reaches a critical value for a specific geometry and running speed. The <b>gear</b> <b>surface</b> will wear slowly with a low specific wear rate if the gear is loaded below the critical one. The possible reason of the sudden increase in wear rate {{is due to the}} gear operating temperature reaching the material melting point under the critical load condition. <b>Gear</b> <b>surface</b> temperature has been then investigated in details through three components: ambient, bulk and flash temperatures. Through extensive experimental investigations and modelling on <b>gear</b> <b>surface</b> temperature variations, a general relation has been built up between <b>gear</b> <b>surface</b> temperature and gear load capacity. An approach for acetal gear transition torque prediction has been proposed and this method is based on the link between polymer gear wear rate and its surface temperature. The method has been related to test results under different operating speeds and gear geometries. Good agreements have been achieved between the proposed method predictions and experimental test results. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

The gears were case carbonized and hardened to a Rockwell c- 60 and finish ground. The gear pitch diameter was 8. 89 cm. The lot of gears was divided into five groups, each of which was tested with a different lubricant.

Test conditions included bulk gear temperature of 350 K, a maximum Hertz stress of 1. 71 GPa (248 ksi) at the pitch line, and a speed of 10, 000 RPM.

40|$|Surface {{fatigue failure}} occurs in geared {{transmission}} systems due to {{factors such as}} high contact stress, and monitoring its progression is vital if the eventual failure of the tooth flank is to be prevented. Techniques involving the analysis of vibration, acoustic emission and oil debris {{have been used to}} successfully monitor the progression of the different phases of <b>gear</b> <b>surface</b> fatigue failure. However, during monitoring a suitable assessment method is required to correlate the characteristics of the signal with the condition of the <b>gear</b> <b>surface.</b> The most commonly used such methods are gear flank profile scanning, replica sample analysis and conventional image analysis, with each technique having both advantages and disadvantages. Responding to the demand for effective assessment methods, this study experimentally evaluates the development of micro-pitting in gears using a new image registration technique in an online health monitoring system. Given a set of captured images of <b>gear</b> <b>surface</b> degradation with different exposure times and geometric deformations, an image registration approach is proposed to cope with inter-image illumination changes of arbitrary shape. Then correlation between the resulting aligned images is compared to a reference one before testing obtained.

Further, the geneses for white spot defects are discussed and the solutions to this problem are also clarified. It is found from the physicochemical analysis that the white spot defects occurred on <b>gear</b> <b>surface</b> can be classified into two parts: a) the ‘single white spot’, which originates from the sick point produced during the carbonization process, and b) the ‘multiple continuous spots’, which are produced by either the non-uniformity surface carbonization or the grinding burn or otherwise the micro ecarbonization caused by overheat on <b>gear</b> <b>surface.</b> For different white spot defects, different strategies should be employed: ultrasonic cleaning technique should be performed for the single white spot case, while for the ‘multiple white spot ’ case, not only should the vacuum carburizing technique be employed to avoid surface non-uniformity of carbonization, but also vacuum oil quenching are needed to clear up the defects induced by micro decarbonization...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{presented}} to compare the transmission gear products from SME (UKM gear) and national scale manufacturer (OEM gear) especially on the surface hardening characterization. Both gears were heat treated with different methods. The gear product of SME was heat treated by pack carburizing and quenching whereas the OEM gear was predicted to be heat treated using induction heating with high frequency. The surface hardening characterization was conducted by investigating the hardening thickness, the hardness number and the microstructure observation on the gear surfaces. The result of the hardening thickness investigation reveals a distinction on the depth of hardening penetration. The heat treatment using long interval pack carburizing of UKM gear produces a deeper penetration and the higher hardness number on the <b>gear</b> <b>surface</b> whereas the OEM gear has a thin hardness penetration and lower hardness number.

In this work <b>gear</b> <b>surface</b> fatigue lives {{for a wide range of}} specific film values were studied using tests done with common rigs, speeds, lubricant temperatures, and test procedures. This study includes previously reported data, results of an additional 50 tests, and detailed information from lab notes and tested gears.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to estimate the contact pattern for gear drives. The proposed method {{is based on the}} geometric properties of the generated surfaces of the pinion and the gear and it neglects the mechanical characteristics of the mating members. The key feature of the method is the superimposition of a virtual marking compound over the <b>gear</b> <b>surface</b> that mimics the industrial practice of contact pattern inspection. For each meshing condition the instantaneous contact area is estimated as the intersection of the pinion surface with the marking compound <b>gear</b> <b>surface.</b> Finally, the contact pattern is estimated by the convex envelope of all the instantaneous contact areas in the zr-plane. The marking compound shape is identified through an optimization process to match a target contact pattern obtained, e. g. with an accurate loaded tooth contact analysis tool. The proposed method has been tested with a dedicated FEM software package capable of producing a very accurate contact pattern estimation of the contact pattern under load. Extensive simulations have shown that, once the optimal marking compound shape has been identified, the proposed method computes a reliable contact pattern even for very different surface geometries (e. g. an ease-off on the pinion surface) and assembly errors. The computational cost of the entire procedure is about two orders of magnitude lower than that required to run the full FEM analysis. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
