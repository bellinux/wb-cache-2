Sales were boosted by exporting the Kingswood sedan, station wagon, and utility body styles to Indonesia, Trinidad and Tobago, Pakistan, the Philippines, and South Africa in complete <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> form.|$|E
5|$|Styracosaurs were herbivorous dinosaurs; they {{probably}} fed mostly on low growth {{because of the}} position of the head. They may, however, have been able to <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> taller plants with their horns, beak, and bulk. The jaws were tipped with a deep, narrow beak, believed to have been better at grasping and plucking than biting.|$|E

5|$|Outside of Nova Scotia, {{the winds}} from Carol were {{strong enough to}} <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> trees and power lines in New Brunswick. Light rainfall, peaking at 2.44inches (62mm) in the province, caused street {{flooding}} in Moncton. The rainfall reached as far west as Ontario, and as far east as Prince Edward Island, where rainfall reached 1.73inches (44mm). Winds in the latter province damaged roofs and downed some trees, resulting in minor power outages. Further north in Quebec, adverse conditions from the storm delayed a search party after a plane crash.|$|E
5|$|After work on UB-10 was {{complete}} at the Weser yard, she was readied for rail shipment. The process of shipping a UB I boat involved breaking the submarine down {{into what was}} essentially a <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> kit. Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded onto eight railway flatcars. In early 1915, the sections of UB-10 were shipped to Antwerp for assembly in what was typically a two- to three-week process. After UB-10 was assembled and launched on 20 February, she was loaded on a barge and taken through canals to Bruges where she underwent trials.|$|E

5|$|August 13, 2004– Hurricane Charley makes {{landfall}} on Cayo Costa with {{winds of}} 150mph (240km/h) and hours later hits the mainland {{portion of the}} state at Punta Gorda, becoming the strongest hurricane to hit the United States since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. The winds damage or destroy thousands of homes, <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> {{tens of thousands of}} trees, and leave more than 2million Floridians without power. Charley results in eightdirect fatalities, 20indirect casualties, and 792reported injuries. Throughout the state, damage is estimated at $13.5billion (2004USD, $17.5billion 2017USD), at the time the second costliest hurricane in United States history; it has since dropped to sixth.|$|E
5|$|Climate {{change and}} weather-related natural {{disasters}} also threaten lemur survival. For the last 1000 years, western and highland regions {{have been growing}} significantly drier, {{but in the past}} few decades, severe drought has become much more frequent. There are indications that deforestation and forest fragmentation are accelerating this gradual desiccation. The effects of drought are even felt in the rainforests. As annual rainfall decreases, the larger trees that make up the high canopy suffer increased mortality, failure to fruit, and decreased production of new leaves, which folivorous lemurs prefer. Cyclones can defoliate an area, <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> canopy trees, and create landslides and flooding. This can leave lemur populations without fruit or leaves until the following spring, requiring them to subsist on crisis foods, such as epiphytes.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} break, Jack's girlfriend CNBC host Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) {{moved in with}} him. Avery decides to redecorate Jack's apartment. He is not keen on the idea, but not wanting to say no or give into Avery's demands, decides to employ the Fabian strategy—named after Fabius Maximus, a Roman general who {{employed}} a strategy of avoiding battles, instead wearing the enemy down by attrition. Jack is successful in avoiding redecorating the apartment; he agrees to <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> a wall instead. At {{the end of the}} episode, however, he realizes that Avery has emulated the military genius of Hannibal, outmaneuvering his Fabian strategy, and he ecstatically realizes they are a perfect match, far beyond the level of mere soul-mates.|$|E

5|$|September 17, 2003- Hurricane Isabel {{passes to}} the {{southwest}} of the state as it makes landfall on North Carolina. In the days preceding its landfall, Isabel produces strong waves, and upon striking land, the storm causes a 5-foot (1.5m) storm surge along the Delaware coast. The waves and surge result in beach erosion and overwash. The outer rainbands of Isabel drop around 1inch (25mm) of rain, though the storm's large circulation produces strong wind gusts of up to 70mph (112km/h). The wind gusts <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> many trees and power lines, causing {{one of the worst}} power outages for Conectiv Energy. Damage totals to $17.8million (2003USD, $20.9million 2008USD). Due to the damage, President Bush declares the entire state a disaster area.|$|E

5|$|The shock {{generated}} by the Pacific electric ray can be enough to <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> an adult human. It should be treated with caution, especially at night when it is active, and {{has been known to}} charge at divers with its mouth agape if harassed. It is not known to be responsible for any fatalities, but may have been involved in several unexplained, fatal diving accidents. This species fares poorly in captivity, as it usually refuses to feed when first introduced into an aquarium. Since 2000, the Aquarium of the Bay and the Monterey Bay Aquarium have had some success keeping Pacific electric rays by offering them moving food.|$|E
5|$|While passing {{south of}} Bermuda, Felix {{produced}} sustained winds of 63mph (102km/h) with gusts to 80mph (129km/h). The winds were {{strong enough to}} <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> trees and leave 20,000people without power, although most outages were quickly restored. Television service was also interrupted. The storm also destroyed a few fishing boats and damaged hotels along the island's southern shore, where prolonged high surf caused considerable beach erosion. The Causeway connecting St. David's Island with the mainland sustained some damage, contributing to an estimated $2.5 million in losses on Bermuda. The hurricane's passage postponed the scheduled vote for Bermuda's independence.|$|E
5|$|Wind also limits tree growth. On coasts and {{isolated}} mountains, {{the tree line}} is often much lower than in corresponding altitudes inland and in larger, more complex mountain systems, because strong winds reduce tree growth. High winds scour away thin soils through erosion, as well as damage limbs and twigs. When high winds <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> or uproot trees, the process is known as windthrow. This is most likely on windward slopes of mountains, with severe cases generally occurring to tree stands that are 75years or older. Plant varieties near the coast, such as the Sitka spruce and sea grape, are pruned back by wind and salt spray near the coastline.|$|E

5|$|Both {{the player}} and the {{opponent}} have stamina meters, both {{displayed on the}} top of the screen. The meters decrease when either boxer gets hit by a punch. Boxers will get <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> if their stamina meter runs out. Faster knockdowns will cause that boxer to recover less stamina upon getting up; the same happens if a boxer is <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> by a knockout punch. Either boxer will lose if they cannot stand up before the count of ten after being <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> (resulting in a knockout or KO) or if they are <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> three times in the match (resulting in a technical knockout or TKO). The player can also recover some stamina while the opponent is down by pressing the buttons on the controller.|$|R

5|$|Arkham Origins {{is an open}} world action-adventure game {{incorporating}} stealth game tactics. Batman can use his cape {{to glide}} around Gotham City and the grapnel gun's retracting rope to attach to hard-to-reach ledges and extend his flight. Some gadgets from previous Arkham games are present {{at the start of}} Arkham Origins, while others become available during play. Returning gadgets include the Cryptographic Sequencer, used to hack security consoles; the Batclaw, used for hooking onto surfaces; the Batarang, a throwing weapon; the Remote Batarang, its remote-controlled counterpart; Explosive Gel, used to destroy weak surfaces and <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> enemies; Smoke Pellets, used for stealthy exits and entrances; the Disruptor, which can remotely disable guns and explosive mines, and the Grapnel Accelerator, an earlier version of the Grapnel Boost. New equipment in Batman's arsenal include the Remote Claw; this allows Batman to target two objects and pull them together, allowing him to throw enemies into each other or hit them with objects (tethering two walled points creates a tightrope for Batman to cross); Shock Gloves, which allow Batman to block electric attacks, disable some enemies and stun shielded ones, and short-circuit objects, and the Concussion Detonator, capable of stunning large enemy groups.|$|E
5|$|By 1923, HMBB were {{producing}} 12,000units per year. During this time, HMBB was {{the first}} company to assemble bodies for Ford Motor Company of Australia until its Geelong plant was completed. From 1924, HMBB became the exclusive supplier of car bodies for GM in Australia, with manufacturing taking place at the new Woodville plant. These bodies were made to suit a number of chassis imported from manufacturers such as Chevrolet and Dodge. In 1926 General Motors (Australia) was established with assembly plants at Newstead, Queensland; Marrickville, New South Wales; City Road, Melbourne; Birkenhead, South Australia; and Cottesloe, Western Australia using bodies produced by Holden Motor Body Builders and imported complete <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> (CKD) chassis. In 1930 alone, the still independent Woodville plant built bodies for Austin, Chrysler, DeSoto, Morris, Hillman, Humber, Hupmobile and Willys-Overland as well GM cars. The last of this line of business was the assembly of Hillman Minx sedans in 1948. The Great Depression led to a substantial downturn in production by Holden, from 34,000units annually in 1930 to just 1,651units one year later. In 1931 General Motors purchased Holden Motor Body Builders and merged it with General Motors (Australia) Pty Ltd to form General Motors-Holden's Ltd (GM-H). Throughout the 1920s Holden also supplied tramcars to the Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board, of which several examples have been preserved in both Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Carol {{maintained}} its intensity {{as it moved}} inland, and its winds were strong enough to <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> trees and power lines in New Hampshire. One tree fell onto a car, killing a person, and there were three deaths overall in the state, along with $3million in damage. There was also a death in neighboring Vermont. Carol produced winds of up to 80mph (130km/h) in Augusta, Maine. Throughout the state, the winds downed hundreds of trees, some of which damaged houses, wrecked cars, destroyed one building, or fell onto power lines. Fallen trees blocked highways, and one person was injured by a falling tree limb. Downed power lines left several counties without power or telephone services. The winds flattened hundreds of acres of corn in North Livermore, and throughout the state, there was heavy damage to the apple crop. Damage to the apple crop amounted to $1.7million. While moving west of Maine, the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall, including a report of 2.15inches (63mm) in 12hours. Along the coast, high waves damaged boats. In Maine, the hurricane killed three people, injured at least eight, and caused $10million in damage, the costliest natural disaster in the state's history. Carol lost this distinction 10days later when Hurricane Edna caused $15million in damage in the state.|$|E

40|$|Trade in <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> {{products}} {{embodies the}} international {{division of labour}} and the distribution characteristics of the global value chains. The value chain of the trade in <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> products is defined in this paper through {{the analysis of the}} process of the intra-product international division of labour. Firstly, the value chain of <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> products is divided into two parts, i. e. the value chain of product design and production and the value change of product assembly and sale. Then, the necessary conditions are deduced to realize the reconstruction of the value chain. The tariff escalation policy of the importing country is the main reason for the disruption of the product value chain and the value shifting to the importing country. Finally, the areas of value chain disruption in the cases of various modes of trade in <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> products are established. As a result, the research on the restructuring of the value chain in the trade in <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> products will help companies choose a high value link in the value chain from the global distribution perspective...|$|R
