5|$|All trucks of the LRDG were {{equipped}} with the Bagnold sun compass and some trucks were also {{equipped with}} a P8 Tank Compass. Each patrol had a navigator who always rode in the second truck in the formation. He was equipped with a theodolite and astronomical position tables with which to plot star sightings, and maps. Watches were used and adjusted each evening using the GMT time check. One major problem faced early on by the LRDG {{was a lack of}} accurate maps for Libya in particular. Patrols had to <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> surveys and make their own maps of each route they took. In July 1941 the Survey Section was formed to carry out this task.|$|E

5|$|Vlad Ţepeş's only ally, Mihály Szilágyi, was {{captured}} in 1460 by the Turks while traversing Bulgaria. Szilágyi's men were tortured to death, while Szilágyi was killed by being sawed in half. Later that year, Mehmed sent envoys to Vlad to urge him to pay the delayed Jizya (tax on non-Muslims). Vlad Ţepeş provoked Mehmed by having the envoys killed and in a letter dated September 10, 1460, addressed to the Transylvanian Saxons of Kronstadt (today: Braşov), he warned them of Mehmed's invasion plans and asked for their support. Vlad Ţepeş had not paid the annual Jizya (tax on non-Muslims) of 10,000 ducats since 1459. In addition to this, Mehmed asked him for 1000 boys that were to be trained as janissaries. Vlad Ţepeş refused the demand, and the Turks crossed the Danube and started to <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> recruiting, to which Vlad reacted by capturing the Turks and impaling them. The conflict continued until 1461, when Mehmed asked the Prince to come to Constantinople and negotiate with him.|$|E

25|$|Student {{involvement}} {{in the classroom is}} a key part of OBE. Students are expected to <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> learning, so that they gain a full understanding of the material. Increased student involvement allows students to feel responsible for their own learning, and they should learn more through this individual learning. Other aspects of involvement are parental and community, through developing curriculum, or making changes to it. OBE outcomes are meant to be decided upon within a school system, or at a local level. Parents and community members are asked to give input in order to uphold the standards of education within a community and to ensure that students will be prepared for life after school.|$|E
25|$|Market {{interest}} rates apply to village bank loans, usually matching what local commercial banks charge their customers but usually {{only a tiny}} fraction of the usurious rates charged by local moneylenders. The capital for these loans is provided by FINCA with on-time weekly installment repayments collectively guaranteed by all members—i.e., a shortfall by one member must be covered by other group members. Village banks are highly democratic, self-managed, grassroots organizations. They elect their own leaders, select their own members, create their own bylaws, <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> bookkeeping, manage all funds, disburse and deposit all funds, resolve loan delinquency problems, and levy their own fines on members who come late, miss meetings, or fall behind in their payments.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{alternative}} theories for the origins or meaning of Waltzing Matilda {{have been proposed}} since {{the time it was}} written; however, most experts now essentially agree on the details outlined above. Some oral stories collected during the twentieth century claimed that Paterson had merely modified a preexisting bush song, but there is no evidence for this. In 1905 Paterson himself published a book of bush ballads he had collected from around Australia entitled Old Bush Songs, with nothing resembling Waltzing Matilda in it. Nor do any other publications or recordings of bush ballads include anything to suggest it predated Paterson. Meanwhile, handwritten manuscripts from the time the song originated indicate the song's origins with Paterson and Christina Macpherson, as <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> recollections and other pieces of evidence.|$|E

25|$|The tenants of the Redstone started {{organizing}} and formed the Redstone Tenants Association (RTA) in 1999 to coordinate organizing around possibly buying {{the building and}} making general improvements to the large property {{as part of a}} general concern about gentrification of the neighborhood resulting in evictions and rising rents. San Francisco was experiencing a hot rental market with the dot-com boom that created high-paying technical jobs and, in the process, displaced both commercial and residential renters with evictions and skyrocketing rents. With the help of the Mission Economic Development Association (MEDA) the tenants obtained a grant to <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> economic analysis of the building with the intent to make a formal bid for purchase. A variety of entities were approached with the hope of finding a non-profit owner.|$|E
25|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of insects}} {{that live in}} colonies, such as ants, bees, wasps and termites, {{has always been a}} source of fascination for children, naturalists and artists. Individual insects seem to <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> thing without any central control, yet the colony as a whole behaves in a highly coordinated manner. Researchers have found that cooperation at the colony level is largely self-organized. The group coordination that emerges is often just a consequence of the way individuals in the colony interact. These interactions can be remarkably simple, such as one ant merely following the trail left by another ant. Yet put together, the cumulative effect of such behaviours can solve highly complex problems, such as locating the shortest route in a network of possible paths to a food source. The organised behaviour that emerges in this way is sometimes called swarm intelligence.|$|E
500|$|Liber AL vel Legis {{does make}} clear some {{standards}} of individual conduct. The most primary {{of these is}} [...] "Do what thou wilt" [...] which is presented as {{the whole of the}} law, and also as a right. [...] Some interpreters of Thelema believe that this right includes an obligation to allow others to <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> wills without interference, but Liber AL makes no clear statement on the matter. [...] Crowley himself wrote that {{there was no need to}} detail the ethics of Thelema, for everything springs from [...] "Do what thou Wilt". Crowley wrote several additional documents presenting his personal beliefs regarding individual conduct in light of the Law of Thelema, some of which do address the topic interference with others: Liber OZ, Duty, and Liber II.|$|E

He conceded, [...] "that's their business. Everybody needs to <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> thing." [...] Critics generally enjoyed the characters and voice acting. People liked the cast, particularly George Segal. Saturday Morning Fever praised Jessie Bannon for her resemblance to Dr. Quest. Allan Johnson approved of the age jump, as Jonny and Hadji were now {{old enough to be}} part of the action. He considered Jessie [...] "cool... she gives Jonny grief just because she can, and she's not afraid of the action." [...] He did not enjoy the [...] "toned down" [...] portrayal of Race Bannon. Some fans objected to Race's Western accent in the first season. Peter Lawrence defended the portrayal of Race as a [...] "man of action, not thought—though perfectly capable of deep thought", noting that his accent and mannerisms encouraged variety, surprise, and originality.|$|E
500|$|In 2003 S Club {{confirming}} the split [...] "wasn't a final straw", Spearritt has remarked {{that the group}} had felt it appropriate wanting to <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> thing; she had constantly felt [...] "drained" [...] whilst with S Club. The final single was a double A-side, coupling [...] "Love Ain't Gonna Wait for You", from their fourth album Seeing Double, with a new ballad, [...] "Say Goodbye". Returning to the style of their first single, [...] "Say Goodbye" [...] saw vocals shared around the group. The single reached number-two in the UK, beaten to the top spot by R. Kelly's [...] "Ignition (Remix)", and was included on S Club's greatest hits album, , released in June 2003. This compilation brought together the group's releases with a previously unreleased track, [...] "Everybody Get Pumped" [...] and 7 track [...] "Bring the House Down". The album reached number-two in the United Kingdom. S Club eventually disbanded {{after the release of}} [...] "Say Goodbye" [...] on 26 May 2003.|$|E
500|$|Attempting {{to perfect}} their work, Coldplay had to [...] "step it {{up a few}} notches and work hard at it to get it right". The band chose Danton Supple, who mixed the bulk of A Rush of Blood to the Head, to oversee the {{production}} of X. When January went, the band had to finish the album; they were conscious of the pressure as [...] "expectations for the record grew larger" [...] and [...] "completing it became tougher and tougher". Finally, the band was settled with the song [...] "Square One", which Martin has described as [...] "a call to arms" [...] and a [...] "plea" [...] {{to each of them}} [...] "not to be intimidated by anything or anyone else". Once finished, the band felt like they could <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> songs and not have to think of anyone else's demands. During this month, the band was into the final weeks of production and had put the finishing touches on the tracks.|$|E

[...] Harper was also enthusiastic: [...] "This performance for me represents what I like about New Directions—and why Kurt {{needs to come}} back asap. Everyone got to <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> individual thing, yet they still work really well as a group. I give it best song of the night." [...] In Semigran's view, [...] "From the cute choreographed claps to the unconventional (but oddly fitting) choice to have Tina and Mercedes sing the tune, I wish they'd save this one for regionals. It was a winner", while VanDerWerff wrote, [...] " [...] 'Dog Days Are Over' is right in this show's wheelhouse, so, naturally, it hits the song out of the park."

500|$|At the Ipatiev House, Olga and {{her sisters}} were {{eventually}} required to <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> laundry and {{learned how to make}} bread. The girls took turns keeping Alexandra company and amusing Alexei, who was still confined to bed and suffering from pain after his latest injury. Olga was reportedly deeply depressed and lost a great deal of weight during her final months. [...] "She was thin, pale, and looked very sick", recalled one of the guards, Alexander Strekotin, in his memoirs. [...] "She took few walks in the garden, and spent most of her time with her brother." [...] Another guard recalled that the few times she did walk outside, she stood there [...] "gazing sadly into the distance, making it easy to read her emotions." [...] Later, Olga appeared angry with her younger sister Maria for being too friendly to the guards, reported Strekotin. After late June, when a new command was installed, the family was forbidden from fraternizing with the guards and the conditions of their imprisonment became even more stringent.|$|E
500|$|In their {{development}} process, Boxleiter and Wohlwend both proposed {{and worked on}} each other's ideas, and would drop the ideas they found unexciting. The two also built games from keywords and brainstorming, and would flesh out the game mechanics through [...] "heated" [...] argument. Their labor as a team was divided in that Wohlwend always did the art and Boxleiter the programming, as reflective of their skills at the time. The pair agreed to an assessment of their partnership as [...] "left-brain right-brain", and agreed that [...] "editing"—the process of iterating through revisions—was central to their joint work. As they worked, they always retained their prototypes. They both appreciated the [...] "creative freedom" [...] of being self-employed, though they struggled with the business aspects, relative workplace [...] "isolation", low salaries, and lack of job stability. Both were motivated to <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> work instead of contracted tasks. They thought of themselves as artists and of their work as experimental. Boxleiter and Wohlwend worked long hours when making the Flash games, which they found exciting and unsustainable. At Intuition, they worked on games such as Dinowaurs, Gray, Fig. 8, and Liferaft and participated in at least six game jams. As of April 2010, they had created 10 games together.|$|E
