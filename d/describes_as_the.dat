25|$|Armstrong's {{theory of}} {{universals}} treats relations as having no particular ontological difficulty, {{they can be}} treated {{in the same way}} non-relational properties are. How Armstrong's theory of universals deals with relations with varying adicities has been raised as an issue by Fraser MacBride. MacBride argues that there can be relations where the number of terms in the relation varies across instances. Armstrong's response is to affirm a theory he <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Principle of Instantial Invariance, wherein the adicity of properties are essential and invariant. According to Armstrong, complex relations which seem to challenge the principle are not ontologically real but are second-order properties that can be reduced to more basic properties that subscribe to the Principle of Instantial Invariance.|$|E

25|$|Indonesia {{seems to}} have been a travel {{destination}} for centuries. Some panels in Borobudur bas-reliefs depicted drink vendors, warungs (small restaurant), tavern or lodging where people drinking and dancing. The historical record about travel in Indonesia can be found since 14th century. The Nagarakretagama reported about King Hayam Wuruk's royal travel throughout Majapahit realm in East Java with large numbers of carriages, accompanied by nobles, royal courtiers, officials and servants. Although it seems as stately affair, for some instances the king's journey is somewhat resembles modern day tour, as the king visited numbers of interesting places; from temples such as Palah and Jajawa, to enjoying mountain scenery, having bath in petirtaan (bathing pools) and beach. The 15th-century travelogue of Bujangga Manik, a travelling Hindu scholar-priest from Pakuan Pajajaran, reported about his travel around Java and Bali. Although his travel was a pilgrimage one; visiting temples and sacred places in Java and Bali, sometimes he behaves like a modern-day tourist, such as sitting around fanning his body while enjoying beautiful mountain scenery in Puncak area, look upon Gede volcano that he <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> highest point around Pakuan Pajajaran (capital of Sunda kingdom).|$|E
