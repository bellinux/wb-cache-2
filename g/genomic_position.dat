40|$|Abstract Background Recent genome wide {{transcription}} factor binding site or chromatin modification mapping analysis techniques, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) linked to DNA microarray analysis (ChIP on chip) or ChIP coupled to high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), generate tremendous amounts of genomic location {{data in the}} form of one-dimensional series of signals. After pre-analysis of these data (signal pre-clearing, relevant binding site detection), biologists need to search for the biological relevance of the detected <b>genomic</b> <b>positions</b> representing transcription regulation or chromatin modification events. Results To address this problem, we have developed a G enomic P osition A nnotation T ool (GPAT) with a simple web interface that allows the rapid and systematic labelling of thousands of <b>genomic</b> <b>positions</b> with several types of annotations. GPAT automatically extracts gene annotation information around the submitted positions from different public databases (Refseq or ENSEMBL). In addition, GPAT provides access to the expression status of the corresponding genes from either existing transcriptomic databases or from user generated expression data sets. Furthermore, GPAT allows the localisation of the genomic coordinates relative to the chromosome bands and the well characterised ENCODE regions. We successfully used GPAT to analyse ChIP on chip data and to identify genes functionally regulated by the TATA binding protein (TBP). Conclusion GPAT provides a quick, convenient and flexible way to annotate large sets of <b>genomic</b> <b>positions</b> obtained after pre-analysis of ChIP-chip, ChIP-seq or other high throughput sequencing-based techniques. Through the different annotation data displayed, GPAT facilitates the interpretation of genome wide datasets for molecular biologists. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Elevated {{sequencing}} {{error rates}} {{are the most}} predominant obstacle in single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection, which is a major goal in the bulk of current studies using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Beyond routinely handled generic sources of errors, certain base calling errors relate to specific sequence patterns. Statistically principled ways to associate sequence patterns with base calling errors have not been previously described. Extant approaches either incur decisive losses in power, due to relating errors with individual <b>genomic</b> <b>positions</b> rather than motifs, or do not properly distinguish between motif-induced and sequence-unspecific sources of errors. Results: Here, for the first time, we describe a statistically rigorous framework for the discovery of motifs that induce sequencing errors. We apply our method to several datasets from Illumina GA IIx, HiSeq 2000, and MiSeq sequencers. We confirm previously known error-causing sequence contexts and report new more specific ones. Conclusions: Checking for error-inducing motifs should be included into SNP calling pipelines to avoid false positives.

The two issues of gene-specific cis control and <b>genomic</b> <b>position</b> can be studied by determining the extent of dosage compensation of a transposable element at different chromosomal locations. To determine whether the multicopy copia transposable element can dosage compensate, we used the X-linked white-apricot (w(a)) mutation in which a copia element is present. The extent of dosage compensation was determined for the white and copia promoters in larvae and adults in two different genomic locations of the w(a) allele. We conclude that copia is able to dosage compensate, and that the white promoter and the copia promoter are not coordinate in their dosage compensation abilities when assayed under these various conditions. Thus, two transcriptional units, one within the other, {{both of which are}} able to dosage compensate, do so differently in response to developmental stage and <b>genomic</b> <b>position...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background: Current {{methods to}} find {{significantly}} under- and over-represented gene ontology (GO) terms {{in a set}} of genes consider the genes as equally probable "balls in a bag", as may be appropriate for transcripts in micro-array data. However, due to the varying length of genes and intergenic regions, that approach is inappropriate for deciding if any GO terms are correlated with a set of <b>genomic</b> <b>positions.</b> Results: We present an algorithm – GONOME – that can determine which GO terms are significantly associated with a set of <b>genomic</b> <b>positions</b> given a genome annotated with (at least) the starts and ends of genes. We show that certain GO terms may appear to be significantly associated with a set of randomly chosen positions in the human genome if gene lengths are not considered, and that these same terms have been reported as significantly over-represented in a number of recent papers. This apparent over-representation disappears when gene lengths are considered, as GONOME does. For example, we show that, when gene length is taken into account, the term "development" is not significantly enriched in genes associated with human CpG islands, in contradiction to a previous report. We further demonstrate the efficacy of GONOME by showing that occurrences of the proteosome-associated control element (PACE) upstream activating sequence in the S. cerevisiae genome associate significantly to appropriate GO terms. An extension of this approach yields a whole-genome motif discovery algorithm that allows identification of many other promoter sequences linked to different types of genes, including a large group of previously unknown motifs significantly associated with the terms 'translation' and 'translational elongation'. Conclusion: GONOME is an algorithm that correctly extracts over-represented GO terms from a set of <b>genomic</b> <b>positions.</b> By explicitly considering gene size, GONOME avoids a systematic bias toward GO terms linked to large genes. Inappropriate use of existing algorithms that do not take gene size into account has led to erroneous or suspect conclusions. Reciprocally GONOME may be used to identify new features in genomes that are significantly associated with particular categories of genes. </p...|$|R

40|$|An {{improved}} {{understanding of}} the biological and numerical properties of measures of population differentiation across loci is becoming increasingly more important because of their growing use in analyzing genome-wide polymorphism data for detecting population structures, inferring the rates of migration, and identifying local adaptations. In a genome-wide analysis, we discovered that the estimates of population differentiation (e. g., FST,,andJost’sD) calculated for human single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are strongly and positively correlated to the position-specific evolutionary rates measured from multispecies alignments. That is, <b>genomic</b> <b>positions</b> (loci) experiencing higher purifying selection (lower evolutionary rates) produce lower values for the degree of population differentiation than those evolving with faster rates. We show that this pattern is completely mediated by {{the negative effects of}} purifying selection on the minor allele frequency (MAF) at individual loci. Our results suggest that inferences and methods relying on the comparison of population differentiation estimates (FST,,andJost’sD) based on SNPs across <b>genomic</b> <b>positions</b> should be restricted to loci with similar MAFs and/or the rates of evolution in genome scale surveys.

40|$|P element {{transposition}} in Drosophila {{is controlled by}} the cytotype regulatory state: in P cytotype, transposition is repressed, whereas in M cytotype, transposition can occur. P cytotype is determined by a combination of maternally inherited factors and chromosomal P elements in the zygote. Transformant strains containing single elements that encoded the 66 -kD P element protein zygotically repressed transposition, but did not display the maternal repression characteristic of P cytotype. Upon mobilization to new genomic positions, some of these repressor elements showed significant maternal repression of {{transposition in}} genetic assays, involving a true maternal effect. Thus, the <b>genomic</b> <b>position</b> of repressor elements can determine the maternal vs. zygotic inheritance of P cytotype. Immunoblotting experiments indicate that this <b>genomic</b> <b>position</b> effect does not operate solely by controlling the expression level of the 66 -kD repressor protein during oogenesis. Likewise, P element derivatives containing the hsp 26 maternal regulator sequence expressed high levels of the 66 -kD protein during oogenesis, but showed no detectable maternal repression. These data suggest that the location of a repressor element in the genome may determine maternal inheritance of P cytotype by a mechanism involving more than the overall level of expression of the 66 -kD protein in the ovary...|$|E

40|$|Horizontal gene {{transfer}} (HGT) {{is recognized as}} the major force for bacterial genome evolution. Yet, numerous questions remain about the transferred genes, their function, quantity and frequency. The extent to which genetic transformation by exogenous DNA has occurred over evolutionary time was initially addressed by an in silico approach using the complete genome sequence of the Ralstonia solanacearum GMI 1000 strain. Methods based on phylogenetic reconstruction of prokaryote homologous genes families detected 151 genes (13. 3 %) of foreign origin in the R. solanacearum genome and tentatively identified their bacterial origin. These putative transfers were analyzed in comparison to experimental transformation tests involving 18 different <b>genomic</b> DNA <b>positions</b> in the genome as sites for homologous or homeologous recombination. Significant transformation frequency differences were observed among these positions tested regardless of the overall genomic divergence of the R. solanacearum strains tested as recipients. The <b>genomic</b> <b>positions</b> containing the putative exogenous DNA were not systematically transformed at the highest frequencies. The two genomic "hot spots", which contain recA and mutS genes, exhibited transformation frequencies from 2 to more than 4 orders of magnitude higher than positions associated with other genes depending on the recipient strain. These results {{support the notion that}} the bacterial cell is equipped with active mechanisms to modulate acquisition of new DNA in different <b>genomic</b> <b>positions.</b> Bio-informatics study correlated recombination "hot-spots" to the presence of Chi-like signature sequences with which recombination might be preferentially initiated. The fundamental role of HGT is certainly not limited to the critical impact that the very rare foreign genes acquired mainly by chance can have on the bacterial adaptation potential. The frequency to which HGT with homologous and homeologous DNA happens in the environment might have led the bacteria to hijack DNA repair mechanisms in order to generate genetic diversity without losing too much genomic stability...|$|R

Using a genetics-based approach, the influence of <b>genomic</b> <b>position</b> on piggyBac mobility in Drosophila melanogaster was assessed while controlling for element structure, genetic background, and transposase concentration. The mobility of piggyBac elements varied over more than two orders of magnitude solely {{as a result of their}} locations within the genome.
