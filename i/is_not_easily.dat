5|$|A Herdwick's grey fleece <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easily</b> dyed, and is coarse, {{and so is}} {{best suited}} to use as carpet wool.

Herdwick lamb and mutton has a very distinct taste, and was even eaten at Queen Elizabeth II's 1953 coronation banquet. Herdwick ewes also commonly produce desirable market lambs and mules by cross-breeding with Suffolk, Cheviot, Charollais and Texel sheep.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, {{the names}} of 19 eze Nri were recorded, but the list <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easily</b> {{converted}} into chronological terms because of long interregnums between installations. Tradition held that at least seven years would pass upon {{the death of the}} eze Nri before a successor could be determined; the interregnum served as a period of divination of signs from the deceased eze Nri, who would communicate his choice of successor from beyond the grave in the seven or more years ensuing upon his death.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to early Qenya, the grammar of Quenya {{was influenced by}} Finnish, an agglutinative language, but much more by Latin, a synthetic and fusional language, and also Greek, from which he probably took {{the idea of the}} diglossia of Quenya with its highly codified variety: the Parmaquesta, used only in certain situations such as literature. Also the phonology of Quenya was inspired by certain aspects of Finnish, but this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easily</b> recognised.|$|E

5|$|Promethium forms {{only one}} stable {{oxidation}} state, +3, {{in the form}} of ions; this is in line with other lanthanides. According to its position in the periodic table, the element cannot be expected to form stable +4 or +2 oxidation states; treating chemical compounds containing Pm3+ ions with strong oxidizing or reducing agents showed that the ion <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easily</b> oxidized or reduced.|$|E
5|$|Above the chromosphere, {{in a thin}} (about 200km) {{transition}} region, {{the temperature}} rises rapidly from around 20,000 K in the upper chromosphere to coronal temperatures closer to 1,000,000 K. The temperature increase is facilitated by the full ionization of helium in the transition region, which significantly reduces radiative cooling of the plasma. The transition region does not occur at a well-defined altitude. Rather, it forms a kind of nimbus around chromospheric features such as spicules and filaments, and is in constant, chaotic motion. The transition region <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easily</b> visible from Earth's surface, but is readily observable from space by instruments sensitive to the extreme ultraviolet portion of the spectrum.|$|E

There is no clear description for the ideal draught camel, though its strength, its ability to survive without water and the flatness of its feet could be indicators. It {{may be used for}} ploughing in pairs or in groups with buffaloes or bullocks. The draught camel can plough at around , and should not be used for more than six hours a day four hours in the morning and two in the afternoon. The camel <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easily</b> exhausted unless diseased or undernourished, and has remarkable endurance and hardiness.|$|E

5|$|Images 4 and 5 assume an {{overhead}} stream {{that is totally}} condensed into a liquid product using water or air-cooling. However, in many cases, the tower overhead <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easily</b> condensed totally and the reflux drum must include a vent gas outlet stream. In yet other cases, the overhead stream may also contain water vapor because either the feed stream contains some water or some steam is injected into the distillation tower (which {{is the case in}} the crude oil distillation towers in oil refineries). In those cases, if the distillate product is insoluble in water, the reflux drum may contain a condensed liquid distillate phase, a condensed water phase and a non-condensible gas phase, which makes it necessary that the reflux drum also have a water outlet stream.|$|E
5|$|Mongolian {{belongs to}} the Mongolic languages. The {{delimitation}} of the Mongolian language within Mongolic is a much disputed theoretical problem, one whose resolution is impeded {{by the fact that}} existing data for the major varieties <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easily</b> arrangeable according to a common set of linguistic criteria. Such data might account for the historical development of the Mongolian dialect continuum, as well as for its sociolinguistic qualities. Though phonological and lexical studies are comparatively well developed, the basis has yet to be laid for a comparative morphosyntactic study, for example between such highly diverse varieties as Khalkha and Khorchin.|$|E
5|$|The {{pictures}} {{are not in}} strictly chronological order. If they are perceived as three groups, then the pictures {{in each of the}} three units inform upon each other, in the same way as was usual in Medieval paintings and stained glass. The three sections of Creation, Downfall, and Fate of Humanity appear in reverse order, when read from the entrance of the chapel. However, each individual scene is painted to be viewed when looking toward the altar. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easily</b> apparent when viewing a reproduced image of the ceiling but becomes clear when the viewer looks upward at the vault. Paoletti and Radke suggest that this reversed progression symbolises a return to a state of grace. However, the three sections are generally described in the order of Biblical chronology.|$|E

The breeding male's legs and feet are horn (pale grey) in colour. The non-breeding male chestnut sparrow has white flecking on the upperparts, and much of its plumage is buff or whitish with chestnut crescent markings, until the bright chestnut of {{the breeding}} plumage is exposed by wear. The non-breeding male's bill fades to a dusky-tipped horn, {{similar to that of}} females, but without dusky tones {{on the cutting edge of}} the mandible (lower portion of beak).|$|E
