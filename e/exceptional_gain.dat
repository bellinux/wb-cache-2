50|$|By {{the late}} 1920s {{the economy of}} the United States had made <b>exceptional</b> <b>gains</b> in {{productivity}} due to electrification, which was a critical factor in mass production. Horses and mules had been replaced by motorcars, trucks and tractors. One-sixth to one-quarter of farmland previously devoted to feeding horses and mules was freed up, contributing to a surplus in farm produce. Although nominal and real wages had increased, they did not keep up with the productivity gains. As a result the ability to produce exceeded market demand, a condition that was variously termed overproduction and underconsumption. Senator Smoot contended that raising the tariff on imports would alleviate the overproduction problem; however, the US had actually been running a trade account surplus, and although manufactured goods imports were rising, manufactured exports were rising even faster. Food exports had been falling and were in trade account deficit; however the value of food imports were a little over half that of manufactured imports.|$|R

Analysts who hold this view point out that, in the past, high price-earnings ratios have usually been followed by slow growth in stock prices. Other analysts argue that history is no longer a true guide because fundamental changes in the economy have made stocks more attractive to investors, justifying a higher price-earnings ratio. > Shen examines the historical relationship between price-earnings ratios and subsequent stock market performance and discusses why history might not repeat itself this time. She finds strong historical evidence that high price-earnings ratios have been followed by disappointing stock market performance in the short and long term. Specifically, high price-earnings ratios have been followed by slow long-run growth in stock prices. Moreover, when high price-earnings ratios have reduced the earnings yield on stocks relative to returns on other investments, short-run stock market performance has suffered as well. Despite this evidence, however, she concludes that we cannot {{rule out the possibility that}} these historical relationships are of little relevance today due to fundamental changes in the economy.

40|$|Many {{people do}} all of their banking online, we and our {{children}} communicate with peers through computer systems, {{and there are many}} jobs that require near continuous interaction with computer systems. Criminals, however, are also “connected”, and our online interaction provides them a conduit into our information like never before. Our credit card numbers and other fiscal information are at risk, our children's personal information is exposed to the world, and our professional reputations are on the line. The discipline of Digital Forensics in law enforcement agencies around the nation and world has grown to match the increased risk and potential for cyber crimes. Even crimes that are not themselves computer-based, may be solved or prosecuted based on digital evidence left behind by the perpetrator. However, no widely accepted mechanism to facilitate sharing of ideas and methodologies has emerged. Different agencies re-develop approaches that have been tested in other jurisdictions. Even within a single agency, there is often significant redundant work. There is great potential efficiency gain in sharing information from digital forensic investigations. This paper describes an on-going design and development project between Oklahoma State University’s Center for Telecommunications and Network Security and the Defense Cyber Crimes Center to develop a Repository of Digital Forensic Knowledge. In its full implementation, the system has potential to provide <b>exceptional</b> <b>gains</b> in efficiency for examiners and investigators.

40|$|The zebu cattle "breeds" {{of eastern}} and {{southern}} Africa are broadly classified into "large" and "small" types. Boran, Karamajong and Sudanese Zebu are examples of the former, while those of the latter include Angoni, Nkedi and Nandi. The habitat of the large zebu is drier {{than that of the}} small types. Growth, fertility, survival, carcass and milk produciton are the traits reviewed. Most of these traits show evidence of tremendous variability which may be due partly to differences in the production systems and agro-ecological zones and partly to the genotype. As expected, improved standards of management and reduced disease risk contribute to the remarkable performance characteristics of some breeds, notably the Boran and Angoni. The small zebus are more fertile than the large types, as expected. They are, thus, better apt for low-input production systems than the latter. Under improved nutrition, both breed types demonstrate high aptitudes to gain weight and to aproduce reasonable carcasses. On the other hand, the "large" types (e. g. Western Baggara and Boran) have evolved adaptive mechanisms to enable them overcome the long periods of feed scarcity as reflected in their great capacity to rapidly build-up body reserves during periods of pasture abundance. They also show characteristic ability for high rate of compensatory growth which enables them to achieve rapid and <b>exceptional</b> <b>gains</b> when fattened. The "unimproved" Orma Borann show greater ability to resist trypanosomiasis than "improved" Boran in Kenya.

If the UTs are selected spatially to have a very small number of common scatterers, the user channels naturally decorrelate as M grows large [8, 9] and space-division multiple access (SDMA) techniques become robust to channel uncertainty [3].|$|R

The magnetic fabric properties can be divided into three intervals, the top interval shows lowest foliation and inconsistent magnetic fabric directions. The middle interval around the main cultural layer shows low foliation, but a clear preferential NW - SE direction of the lineation. This lineation is interpreted as preferential direction of the eolian loess accumulation from the South-East.

The city's automotive industry played a pivotal role in the Italian economic miracle of the 1950s and 1960s, attracting hundred of thousands of immigrants to the city, particularly from the rural southern regions of Italy.
