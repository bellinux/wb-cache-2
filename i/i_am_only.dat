500|$|In 1932, George {{agreed to}} deliver a Royal Christmas speech on the radio, an event that became annual thereafter. He was not in favour of the {{innovation}} originally but was persuaded by the argument that it was what his people wanted. By the silver jubilee of his reign in 1935, {{he had become a}} well-loved king, saying in response to the crowd's adulation, [...] "I cannot understand it, after all <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>only</b> a very ordinary sort of fellow." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{position}} in which the prince was placed by his marriage, while one of distinction, also offered considerable difficulties; in Albert's own words, [...] "I am very happy and contented; but the difficulty in filling my place with the proper dignity is that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>only</b> the husband, not the master in the house." [...] The Queen's household was run by her former governess, Baroness Lehzen. Albert referred to her as the [...] "House Dragon", and manoeuvred to dislodge the Baroness from her position.|$|E

You know how tall <b>I</b> <b>was!</b> how {{we used to}} run--O Mattie, if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> there! The world was all bright then--wasn't it? We didn't expect--to work all our days. Life looked like a meadow, full of daisies and pinks, and the nicest ones and the sweetest birds {{was just a little}} ways on--where the sun was--it didn't look--wasn't we happy?" ...|$|R

'Oh, if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> a prince, and {{could go in}} such a carriage and have a golden umbrella held over me, how happy I should be!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For twenty years!" [...] I exclaimed. [...] "Oh, Jack, {{you must}} be wrong; for how could that <b>be?</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> {{eighteen}} when all this happened. How could my real father have been twenty years away from me, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> eighteen, and <b>I</b> remember him so perfectly?" ...|$|R
500|$|She {{then went}} out on a rainy night and [...] "to make her clothes heavy with water, she {{walked up and down}} about half an hour" [...] before jumping into the River Thames, but a {{stranger}} saw her jump and rescued her. Wollstonecraft considered her suicide attempt deeply rational, writing after her rescue, I have only to lament, that, when the bitterness of death was past, I was inhumanly brought back to life and misery. But a fixed determination is not to be baffled by disappointment; nor will I allow that to be a frantic attempt, {{which was one of the}} calmest acts of reason. In this respect, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>only</b> accountable to myself. Did I care for what is termed reputation, it is by other circumstances that I should be dishonoured.|$|E
500|$|On 7 September, Lody {{went to a}} cycle shop at Haymarket Terrace to hire a bicycle. He {{told the}} owner's {{daughter}} {{that he was an}} American from New York who was sojourning in Edinburgh after the outbreak of war had spoiled a holiday in Europe. He was staying there for a few days while he waited for a berth to become available on a ship to America, as all the transatlantic vessels were fully booked with returnees. He said that he wanted to cycle to places around Edinburgh such as Rosyth and Queensferry and arranged to hire a bicycle. The owner's daughter warned him that some roads were now guarded and he should stop immediately if challenged by a sentry, to which he replied, [...] "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>only</b> going to be cycling about for pleasure!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} a {{contract}} or covenant with God is fundamental to the Jewish religion. [...] The idea that God must uphold {{his end of the}} first commandment has been a subject of works such as Elie Wiesel's play The Trial of God (1979), made in response to the atrocities Wiesel witnessed at Auschwitz. [...] To art historian Matthew Baigell, Hershe's angst regarding his relationship with God is a modern response to the questions of Hillel the Elder's quoted in the Pirkei Avot: [...] "If I am not for myself, who will be for me? [...] But if <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>only</b> for myself, what am I? [...] And if not now, when?" [...] Literary scholar Susanne Klingenstein found Hersh's character unrealistic from the view of Jewish scholarship. [...] She wrote that [...] "the suffering of the righteous" [...] is [...] "one of the greatest problems in Jewish thought", and that a character as devoutly religious as Hersh would not have struggled with what she saw as elementary Jewish teaching.|$|E

500|$|Some vocal {{supporters}} of the defendants spoke out in their defense. A New York resident wrote: [...] "I am not afraid of communism... <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>only</b> afraid of the trend in our country today away from the principles of democracy." [...] Another wrote: [...] "the trial was a political trial... Does not the Soviet Union inspire fear {{in the world at}} large precisely because masses of human beings have no confidence in the justice of its criminal procedures against dissidents?... I trust that the Supreme Court will be able to correct a grave error in the operation of our political machinery by finding the... Smith bill unconstitutional." [...] William Z. Foster wrote: [...] "every democratic movement in the United States is menaced by this reactionary verdict... The Communist Party will not be dismayed by this scandalous verdict, which belies our whole national democratic traditions. It will carry the fight to the higher courts, to the broad masses of the people." [...] Vito Marcantonio of the American Labor Party wrote that the verdict was [...] "a sharp and instant challenge to the freedom of every American." [...] The ACLU issued a statement reiterating its opposition to the Smith Act, because it felt the act criminalized political advocacy.|$|E
500|$|Still about [...] {{behind the}} Frenchman, Grahame-White made a {{historic}} decision; {{he would make}} an unprecedented night flight. [...] Guided by the headlamps of his party's cars, he took off at 2:50am. [...] Within minutes of becoming airborne however, he almost crashed; while he was leaning forward to make himself comfortable, his jacket brushed the engine ignition switch and he accidentally turned the engine off, but he quickly corrected his error {{and was able to}} continue. [...] Using the lights of railway stations to guide his course through the pitch black night, within 40minutes he reached Rugby, and at 3:50am he passed Nuneaton. [...] Despite making good progress, Grahame-White was carrying a large load of fuel and oil, and his engine was not powerful enough to raise the aeroplane over the high ground before him. [...] Disappointed, he landed at Polesworth, about [...] from London, and only 10miles behind Paulhan. [...] A few minutes later the Frenchman, unaware of Grahame-White's progress, resumed his journey. [...] He passed Stafford at 4:45am, Crewe at 5:20am, and at 5:32am he landed at Barcicroft Fields near Didsbury, within five miles of the Manchester office of the Daily Mail, thereby winning the contest. [...] His party was taken by train to a civic reception, held by the Lord Mayor of Manchester. [...] Grahame-White was notified of Paulhan's success, and reportedly shouted [...] "Ladies and gentlemen, the £10,000 prize has been won by Louis Paulhan, the finest aviator that the world has ever seen. [...] Compared with him <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>only</b> a novice. [...] Three cheers for Paulhan!" [...] He retired to bed, leaving his mechanics to repair his aeroplane, and later sent Paulhan a telegram, congratulating his rival on his achievement. [...] Grahame-White attempted to resume his journey to Manchester, and reached Tamworth, but he later abandoned the flight.|$|E

2500|$|Peter's Confession {{begins as}} a {{dialogue}} between Jesus and his disciples in which Jesus begins {{to ask about the}} current opinions about himself among [...] "the multitudes", asking: [...] "Who do the multitudes say that I am?" [...] The disciples provide a variety of the common hypotheses at the time. Jesus then asks his disciples about their own opinion: But who do you say that <b>I</b> <b>am?</b> <b>Only</b> Simon Peter answers him: You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.|$|E
2500|$|Hatton fought Manny Pacquiao on 2 May 2009 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. The {{fight was}} at light welterweight, {{which was the}} sixth weight {{category}} Pacquiao has fought at and is the weight at which Hatton was previously undefeated. Pacquiao defeated Hatton {{in the second round}} by a KO victory after knocking Hatton down twice in the first round. Following the loss to Pacquiao, Hatton put his career on hiatus. After more than a year out of action, in a June 2010 interview with Gulfnews.com, the British boxer seemed uninterested in coming to the ring again. He stated: [...] "Boxing started off as a habit and it ended up giving me some money and making me {{a little bit of a}} better person. But I don't think I will have a fight again. But you can never say never as I have not announced officially that I won't be boxing. At the moment I don't have any fire in the belly for a fight or to get myself to a gym." [...] However, Hatton also added: [...] "But it has been only 13 months and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>only</b> 31, so never count me out." ...|$|E

2500|$|On April 25, 2011, she {{released}} the single [...] "In the Dark". The song enjoyed commercial {{success in the}} United States, peaking at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and the summit of Hot Dance Club Songs and peaked in the top forty in Canada, Australia, Denmark, Ireland, Scotland and the United Kingdom. The song's music video features shots of black-painted hands that touch Dev while she is standing naked. Dev's debut album The Night the Sun Came Up has been released in United Kingdom on September 20, 2011. Since 2009, Dev {{has been working on}} her debut album with main producers, The Cataracs. In March 2011, Dev and The Cataracs traveled to Costa Rica for three weeks where they recorded and produced most of the material for the new album. She said of the album's genres, [...] "typical pop music is not what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>only</b> good at doing; I have a lot of ideas and hip-hop influence records, some electro ballads." [...] In March 2011, New Boyz's single [...] "Backseat", featuring Dev and The Cataracs, was released. The song peaked at number twenty-six on the Billboard Hot 100.
