5|$|Aaron Benjamin Sorkin (born June 9, 1961) is an American screenwriter, director, {{producer}} and playwright. His works include the Broadway plays A <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Men</b> and The Farnsworth Invention; the television series Sports Night, The West Wing, Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip and The Newsroom; and the films A <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Men,</b> The American President, Charlie Wilson's War, Moneyball and Steve Jobs.

5|$|In March 2016, it was {{announced}} that Sorkin would be adapting A <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Men</b> for a live production on NBC, slated to air in 2018.|$|E
5|$|Sorkin wrote several {{drafts of}} the script for A <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Men</b> in his Manhattan apartment, {{learning}} the craft from a book about screenplay format. He then spent several months at the Los Angeles offices of Castle Rock, working on the script with director Rob Reiner. William Goldman (who regularly worked under contract at Castle Rock) became his mentor and helped him to adapt his stageplay into a screenplay. The movie was directed by Reiner, starred Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, Demi Moore and Kevin Bacon, and was produced by Brown. A <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Men</b> was released in 1992 and was a box office success.|$|E

That they have started the {{practice}} of headhunting can be seen from one of their songs: Ka pa lamtlâk an tha'n dang, Sinlung lamtlâk a tha'n dang; Shan khuoah tha povin vang, Tuoichawngin hranlu an tlunna; Thlomu sieka kem in hril, Za inhawngah hranlu bah kan sâl. My father's steps were distinctively good, Sinlung's steps were, indeed, distinctively good; <b>Few</b> are the <b>good</b> <b>men</b> in Shan State, Where Tuoichawng brought the enemy's head; You talked of tips with eagle's claws, (meaning war) And we hang the heads high with ropes ...|$|R

Nor is it political economy to build a city on good ground, and fill it with store of corn and treasure, and put a score of lepers to live in it. Political economy creates together the means of life, and the living persons who are to use them; and of both, {{the best and the}} most that it can, but imperatively the best, not the most. A <b>few</b> <b>good</b> and healthy <b>men,</b> rather than a multitude of diseased rogues; and a little real milk and wine rather than much chalk and petroleum; but the gist of the whole business is that the men and their property must both be produced together--not one to the loss of the other. Property must not be created in lands desolate by exile of their people, nor multiplied and depraved humanity, in lands barren of bread.|$|R

5|$|Barrowman {{returned}} {{to the role of}} Billy Crocker in Trevor Nunn's 2003 West End revival of Anything Goes, and appeared in West End non-musical dramas, such as his role as Wyndham Brandon in Rope at the Minerva Theatre, Chichester in 1993, and he starred as Lieutenant Jack Ross opposite Rob Lowe in the 2005 production of A <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Men.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Sorkin revised {{his play}} A <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Men</b> for a revival at the London West End theatre, the Haymarket. The play {{opened at the}} Theatre Royal Haymarket {{in the fall of}} the same year and was {{directed}} by David Esbjornson, with Rob Lowe of The West Wing in the lead role.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Sorkin worked under {{contract}} for Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. He wrote the scripts for A <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Men,</b> Malice and The American President: The three films grossed about US$400million worldwide. While writing for Castle Rock he {{became friends with}} colleagues such as William Goldman and Rob Reiner and met his future wife Julia Bingham, {{who was one of}} Castle Rock's business affairs lawyers.|$|E
40|$|Coal-face work is {{well known}} to be arduous and dangerous; it is {{performed}} in an unnatural environment even where conditions are <b>good.</b> <b>Few</b> <b>men</b> can continue this work {{until the age of}} retirement. They usually seek alternative employment either outside the industry or within the other major occupational groups at a colliery. The latter comprise the surface workers and those employed underground other than at the coal-face. This paper is concerned with those who stay within the industry. From a study of 73 workers who left the coal-face at two collieries, it indicates (1) the extent to which migration to alternative employment occurs each year, and (2) the resultant distribution of ex coal-face workers among these other occupational groups. The length of effective working life of the coal-miner on the coal-face, the reasons which precipitate his leaving it, and the type of work which he is able to do are also described. This information is of economic importance but it is mainly of value in assessing the effects of coal-face work upon the health of the coal-miner...|$|R

5|$|Sorkin got the {{inspiration}} {{to write his}} next play, a courtroom drama called A <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Men,</b> from a phone conversation with his sister Deborah (who had graduated from Boston University Law School and {{signed up for a}} three-year stint with the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps). Deborah told Sorkin {{that she was going to}} Guantanamo Bay to defend a group of Marines who came close to killing a fellow Marine in a hazing ordered by a superior officer. Sorkin took that information and wrote much of his story on cocktail napkins while bartending at the Palace Theatre. He and his roommates had purchased a Macintosh 512K so when he returned home he would empty his pockets of the cocktail napkins and type them into the computer, forming a basis from which he wrote many drafts for A <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Men.</b>|$|E

5|$|Sorkin {{continued}} writing Making Movies and in 1990 it debuted Off-Broadway at the Promenade Theatre, {{produced by}} John A. McQuiggan, and again directed by Don Scardino. Meanwhile, David Brown was producing a few projects at TriStar Pictures {{and tried to}} interest them in making A <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Men</b> into a film but his proposal was declined {{due to the lack}} of star actor involvement. Brown later got a call from Alan Horn at Castle Rock Entertainment who was anxious to make the film. Rob Reiner, a Castle Rock producing partner, opted to direct it.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Dalton felt {{jealous of}} boys {{for the freedom}} they enjoyed. They could travel alone without {{worrying}} about their reputation and were often bribed to attend school, while girls were, in her opinion, educated reluctantly. One of her teachers {{thought it would be}} wasteful for her to study algebra, as she already had sufficient education for a housewife. As a young woman, she felt that women lived on a higher moral level than men. She saw polygamy as a way to allow more women to marry the <b>few</b> <b>good</b> <b>men,</b> arguing that it gave more women the opportunity to marry. She also considered it ironic that prostitution was tolerated but polygamy was considered depraved.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Demi Moore was {{a budding}} A-list film star {{who had been}} married to Bruce Willis since 1987. The couple had had their first child Rumer Willis in 1988, and they had hired three photographers for an {{audience}} of six friends for the delivery. In 1990, she had starred in that year's highest-grossing film, Ghost, for which she was paid $750,000, and she had earned $2.5 million for 1991 roles in The Butcher's Wife and Mortal Thoughts. Following the photo, she would earn $3 million for her 1992 role in A <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Men</b> and $5 million apiece for roles in Indecent Proposal (1993), Disclosure (1994) and The Scarlet Letter (1995).|$|E
