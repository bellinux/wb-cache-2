I {{shall be}} very terse about Tuppy, giving it as {{my opinion that}} in all {{essentials}} he {{is more like a}} wart hog than an ex-member of a fine old English public school. What will ensue? Hearing him attacked, my Cousin Angela's womanly heart will be as sick as mud. The maternal tigress in her will awake. No matter what differences they may have had, she will remember only that he is the man she loves, and will leap to his defence. And from that to falling into his arms and burying the dead past will be but a step. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>react</b> <b>to</b> that?" ...|$|E

When one of your best friends comes out as a superhero, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>react</b> <b>to</b> that? And just trying to find out, “Oh, my friend changed, they’re different, and how do I feel about that? And this is cool, but it’s scary, and I don’t know how I feel about that. And it’s wonderful, and why can’t I have that? Or, I don’t want that. Or, does Skye want that?” It just, to me, captures a whole bunch of questions, which is what we try to do." ...|$|E

Based on Jordan P. (1974), the librarians need to achieve specific objectives but the behavior of the library user's and staffs become the barrier to fulfill the objectives. The research or investigation of patron's behavior cannot be done by observations alone. As an example, the assumptions of a boy is sleeping is not true for a boy who is thinking hard for his problem. It may look simple but sometimes it can be more complicated. The user and patron are the essential element of the library and the librarian should be empathetic and understand their users and have to control many types of user's. However, some of the users have some problems regarding their attitude and it becomes some sort of challenges for the librarians to handle it...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt} Organizations {{are often}} {{challenged}} {{to identify and}} resolve workplace problems. The Critical Incident technique gives them a starting point and a process for advancing organizational development through learning experiences. It helps them study “what people do” in various situations. One might think there are no answers to the following questions: How fast can you think on your feet? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>react</b> {{in the face of}} the unexpected? How can you prepare if you cannot predict? And yet, there are. Evidently, some behaviors contribute to the successor failure of individuals—and organizations—in specific situations. And so, responses to the unforeseen lie in identifying before the fact events or circumstances, or series of them, that are outside the range of ordinary human experiences. The questions posed earlier are as old as mankind; but our ability to address them owes largely to the relatively recent work of John Flanagan. These days critical incidents can be harvested to provide a rich, personal perspective of life that facilitates understanding of the issues and obstacles people face every now and then and illuminates avenues for improvement (or replication if outcomes are effective) —avenues that may not be apparent through purely quantitative methods of data collection. This should matter to high-performance organizations...|$|R
