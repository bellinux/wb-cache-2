5|$|Flanders felt that, {{to quell}} inflation, wage {{increases}} should {{be tied to}} productivity increases, rather {{than the cost of}} living.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} Sweden's {{structural}} problems of slow productivity growth and <b>high</b> <b>wage</b> inflation {{can be linked}} in an important way to the institutional features of its labor market, which {{is characterized by a}} combination of centralized bargaining and wage equalization.

Slow productivity growth is attributed to the inappropriateness of the policy of wage equalization in an environment in which flexible work practices have become increasingly important. ...|$|R

5|$|That {{same day}} in Baltimore, {{hundreds}} of manufacturing workers declared a strike, and the box-makers and sawyers walked out, demanding a ten {{percent increase in}} wages.

5|$|The skyrocketing {{prices were}} {{driven by the}} high {{salaries}} paid to pipeline workers, who were eager to spend their money. The high salaries caused a corresponding demand for <b>higher</b> <b>wages</b> among non-pipeline workers in Alaska. Non-pipeline businesses often could {{not keep up with}} the demand for <b>higher</b> <b>wages,</b> and job turnover was high. Yellow Cab in Fairbanks had a turnover rate of 800 percent; a nearby restaurant had a turnover rate of more than 1,000 percent. Many positions were filled by high school students promoted above their experience level. To meet the demand, Lathrop High School ran in two shifts: one in the morning and the other in the afternoon to teach students who also worked eight hours a day. More wages and more people meant higher demand for goods and services. Waiting in line became a fact of life in Fairbanks, and the Fairbanks McDonald's became No. 2 in the world for sales—behind only the recently opened Stockholm store. Alyeska and its contractors bought in bulk from local stores, causing shortages of everything from cars to tractor parts, water softener salt, batteries and ladders.|$|E

During these years, Argentina developed the largest middle class on the South American continent.|$|E

5|$|In July 1893 {{a peasant}} conference at Corleone drafted model agrarian {{contracts}} for labourers, sharecroppers and tenants and presented {{them to the}} landowners.

The so-called Patti di Corleone (Corleone Covenants), are considered by historians to be the first trade union collective contract in capitalist Italy. In September the state authorities intervened and some of the landowners were persuaded to capitulate. Elsewhere the strike continued until November 1893.

5|$|The later 19th {{century was}} a high point {{in the history of}} civil rights for African Americans. Reconstruction for a time limited the power of former slaveholders in Texas.

Cuney's efforts led to higher employment and <b>higher</b> <b>wages</b> for blacks in the city, especially on the wharves, and eventually led to combined black and white trade unions during the 1890s and early 1900s. Cuney himself rose to the chairmanship of the Texas Republican Party, the most powerful position held by any black American in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Various factors {{lay behind}} this sudden mass response. Economically, the news {{had reached the}} US {{at the height of}} a series of {{financial}} recessions and bank failures in the 1890s. The gold standard of the time tied paper money to the production of gold and shortages {{towards the end of the}} 19th century meant that gold dollars were rapidly increasing in value ahead of paper currencies and being hoarded. This had contributed to the Panic of 1893 and Panic of 1896, which caused unemployment and financial uncertainty. There was a huge, unresolved demand for gold across the developed world that the Klondike promised to fulfil and, for individuals, the region promised <b>higher</b> <b>wages</b> or financial security.|$|E

The decline of IT prices has no robust effect on the share of employment in the lowest paid occupations. Similar results hold within gender, age and education-level groups, with notable differences in these groups. For instance, the share of employment in <b>high</b> <b>wage</b> occupations among females has increased more than among males with the fall of IT prices. This is consistent with arguments that women hold a comparative advantage in communication and social skills, which are in demand in <b>high</b> <b>wage</b> occupations...|$|R
5|$|A {{vote was}} held on 3 May 1965 in which the {{committee}} voted to strike against Coachella Valley grape growers.

This strike became the first time Mexican workers, due to the decision of Cesar Chavez, did not break a strike of Filipinos; later, on 16 September 1965, Chavez's National Farm Workers Association joined the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee on the picket lines. These strikes occurred around the same time when younger Filipino Americans began a period of political self-reflection and awakening.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín kept a {{regulation}} from the dictatorship {{that allowed him}} to regulate the level of wages. He authorized wage increases every three months, to keep them up to the inflation rate. The CGT rejected this, and proposed instead that wages be determined by free negotiations. Alfonsín allowed strike actions, which were forbidden during the dictatorship, which gave the unions another way to expand their influence. There were thirteen general strikes and thousands of minor labor conflicts. However, unlike similar situations in the past, the CGT sided with Alfonsín during the military rebellions, and did not support the removal of a non-Peronist president. The conflicts were caused by high inflation, and the unions requested <b>higher</b> <b>wages</b> in response to it. The unions got the support of the non-unionized retirees, the church and left-wing factions. Popular support for the government allowed it to endure in spite of opposition from the unions.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{were raised}} about {{these changes in}} society. William Langland wrote the poem Piers Plowman {{in the years before}} 1380, praising peasants who {{respected}} the law and worked hard for their lords, but complaining about greedy, travelling labourers demanding <b>higher</b> <b>wages.</b> The poet John Gower feared England might see an uprising similar to the French Jacquerie revolt of 1358, in which the peasants had risen up against their masters. There was a moral panic about the threat posed by newly arrived workers in the towns and the possibility that servants might turn against their masters. New legislation was introduced in 1359 to deal with migrants, existing conspiracy laws were more widely applied and the treason laws were extended to include servants or wives who betrayed their masters and husbands. By the 1370s, there were fears that if the French invaded England, the rural classes might side with the invaders.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a new model}} of risk sharing that allows for permanent wage shocks and nonseparable consumption. My model predicts that <b>high</b> <b>wage</b> men work more and give more money to their parents than their low <b>wage</b> brothers. Because <b>high</b> <b>wage</b> men work more, they consume fewer complements and more substitutes for leisure. I test this model with two new instruments for wages in rural Mexico. I find that <b>high</b> <b>wage</b> men do indeed work more, own fewer televisions, eat the same food and own more cars. These results cannot be explained by a model of risk sharing with separable consumption. Because my wage instruments use education shocks, this paper may also be useful to economists studying education in the developing world...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses {{questions on}} tax and efficiency. In particular, the main research question in essay one is: {{what is the}} impact of state and local taxes as well as expenditure policies on the level, growth, and ratio of <b>high</b> <b>wage</b> workers in U. S. In particular, this essay tries to identify whether interstate differences in state-local level fiscal policies are the main driving force to attract <b>high</b> <b>wage</b> workers or not. Based on Roback (1982) and Epple-Plat’s (1998) model, a theoretical model in presented in which the relationship appears as ambiguous. Empirically, current population survey (CPS) data is used to find out the impact of tax policies. In CPS data, I define <b>high</b> <b>wage</b> workers as one who has earnings greater than 75 percentile of U. S wage distribution. Additionally, Occupational Employment Statistics (published by Bureau of Labor Statistics) is used in which I characterize <b>high</b> <b>wage</b> workers as one who has wages greater than 75 percentiles of all workers in each occupation in the U. S. I include total number of <b>high</b> <b>wage</b> workers, growth of <b>high</b> <b>wage</b> workers, and ratio of <b>high</b> <b>wage</b> to total number of workers in the analysis and examine how fiscal policies affect different forms of <b>high</b> <b>wage</b> workers. The results show that state –local taxes are not the major factors to attract <b>high</b> <b>wage</b> workers although expenditure policies have a positive impact in some cases. I also check the validity of the results by incorporating different time periods, sets of <b>high</b> <b>wage</b> growing states, and various other ways in order to define <b>high</b> <b>wage</b> workers. All the results are consistent with the main findings. Essay two analyzes the impact of enforcement on tax evasion in U. S. Due to declining budget for enforcement in U. S, the tendency to evade taxes has gone up over the years. Recent data from Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reveals that tax evasion costs the Federal Government $ 458 billion between 2008 through 2010. This suggests that strong enforcement policies, as well as a rise, in the budget for enforcement are needed in U. S. I use original Allingham-Sandmo (1972) model in which they found a positive relationship between audit or enforcement and tax compliance. Using Individual Tax Model Data File for 2008 and annual state level data from 1980 to 2014, this paper finds that enforcement has a significant impact on tax compliance. There is a possibility that individuals may respond differently at various levels of income. Here I provide evidence that individual’s responses vary at different stages of income. Furthermore, state level annual data indicates that higher level of enforcement expenditure does decrease the likelihood to avoid taxes. Essay three uses the same theoretical model to examine the impact of sales tax evasion on macroeconomic indicators for a developing country Pakistan. The performance of Pakistan in terms of tax collection is very poor and the government is trying to minimize the loss from tax evasion by incorporating a VAT type general sales tax. Using a computable general equilibrium model, this essay explores the link between sales tax rate, tax gap in sales tax and enforcement level, evasion, and observe the consequences of the evasion on macroeconomic factors. In particular, we run two simulations in which the base case incorporates sales tax evasion of 25 percent and the modified case includes full compliance of the general sales tax. The outcome indicates an increase in Real GNP growth rate, Tax-GDP ratio, and a reduction in the budget deficit...|$|R
