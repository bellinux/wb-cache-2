50|$|The term feeding in {{the context}} of vacuum fillers refers to {{actively}} moving the filling media {{in the direction of the}} lower part of the hopper to support the vacuum approach within the hopper. Feeding is achieved by using moveable feeding augers with scrapers/rigid counter arms. The <b>feeding</b> <b>auger</b> is driven in synchronisation with the rotation of the rotors. Due to the special geometry of both augers and the parallel rotation movement, the filling product is moved vertically in the direction of the vane cell feed system. The required feed intensity depends on the viscosity of the media to be filled. Less active feed is needed with low-viscosity media than with high-viscosity product. There are therefore a variety of combinations or versions of the parts involved in the feeding process.|$|R
50|$|On this model, a new header {{design was}} implemented; an <b>auger</b> <b>feed</b> {{instead of a}} canvas conveyor. Produced from 1959 to 1969, {{approximately}} 75,000 of these were built.|$|R
50|$|The {{key element}} of a vacuum filler is the vacuum filling principle. The filling product is fed into the feed system {{mechanically}} via a hopper with actively driven <b>feeding</b> <b>auger,</b> as well as via vertical “vacuum suction”. Pre-evacuated cells of a vane cell feed system move underneath the hopper. The pressure difference relative to the ambient pressure (underpressure) caused by the evacuation ensures that the cells are filled with product. The feed system moves continuously, thus generating a continuous filling flow. The product is portioned by means of cyclic movements of the feed system. Each cell of the feed system has a particular volume. The portion {{is defined by the}} rotation distance of the rotor. The portioning volume is therefore set in the control system by multiplying the rotor’s rotation distance by the number of the feed system cells within it. The portion weight must be determined in the control system via the portion volume parameter with the aid of scales.|$|R
50|$|The closet auger (named after water closet) feeds a {{relatively}} short auger through a hook-shaped length of metal tubing. The hook shape {{makes it easier to}} <b>feed</b> the <b>auger</b> into the toilet. A plastic boot {{on the end of the}} auger protects the finish of the visible porcelain. Since most toilet clogs occur in the trap built into the bowl, the short cable is sufficient to break up or retrieve the greater majority of clogs.|$|R
50|$|Further, {{their regular}} {{geometry}} and small size allow automatic feeding with very fine calibration. They can be fed to a burner by <b>auger</b> <b>feeding</b> or by pneumatic conveying. Their high density also permits compact {{storage and transport}} over long distance. They can be conveniently blown from a tanker to a storage bunker or silo on a customer's premises.|$|R
5000|$|A {{factor that}} limits {{locomotive}} performance is {{the rate at}} which fuel is fed into the fire. Much of the fireman's time is spent throwing wood or shoveling coal into the firebox of the locomotive to maintain constant steam pressure. In the early 20th century some locomotives became so large that the fireman could not shovel coal fast enough. [...] Consequently, in the United States, various steam-powered mechanical stokers (typically using an <b>auger</b> <b>feed</b> between the fuel bunker and the firebox) became standard equipment and were adopted elsewhere, including Australia and South Africa.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{experiments}} on dicing monocrystalline silicon wafer using micro abrasive water jet turning were performed. A specifically designed water jet machine tool with four axes {{was developed and}} a specially designed cutting head has developed, in which the inside diameter of orifice and focusing tube is φ 125 µm and φ 500 µm respectively, while the silicon carbide solid abrasives with average diameter of 25 - 100 µm was used. In order to control the flow rate of micro abrasives precisely, an abrasive <b>feed</b> system with <b>auger</b> mechanism driven by DC motor reducer was used. The diameters of monocrystalline silicon bars are around 50 mm. Two basic turning methods, i. e. turning with stationary jet and turning with moving jet were applied. The preliminary experimental results such as kerf width, wafer thickness, surface quality etc. were analyzed. It was found that micro abrasive water jet {{can be used to}} precisely turn brittle materials like monocrystalline silicon. The turned wafer with thickness of 1 mm above could be achieved. A thinner wafer less than 1 mm is difficult to obtain during experiments because of cracking or chipping. Experiments demonstrate that the wafer surface has macro stripping characteristics similar to linear cutting. It was observed that there is less waviness and smooth surface on the turned wafer when with moving jet. And it depends greatly on the water jet pressure, feed rate of the jet, rotation speed of silicon bar, abrasive particle siz...|$|R
50|$|Early Traeger Grills, {{as well as}} many of the pellet grills first {{introduced}} after the expiration of the Traeger patent, used a simple three-position controller, sometimes called a LMH controller. As the name suggests, the control panel utilizes a knob with three settings, Low (or Smoke), Medium, and High, intended for smoking, baking, and grilling, respectively. Each setting approximates a temperature range, and those temperatures were achieved by means of a fixed, predetermined duty cycle*. For instance, on Medium the pellet grill reaches 300-325 °F by repeating a duty cycle in which the <b>auger</b> <b>feeds</b> pellets for two minutes then goes idle for two minutes. So long as the controller remains on that setting, the pellet grill continuously performs the same duty cycle. Although this type of controller can automatically reach and maintain a predetermined cooking range—give or take 25-50 °F—it has obvious shortcomings. Offering only three temperature settings, with large jumps in temperature between each, limits cooking options and prevents the user from cooking with precision. Furthermore, because the duty cycles are fixed, they don't account for weather conditions or the amount of food being cooked, both of which affect temperature. Thus, on a cold, windy day, a pellet grill with a three-position controller that is filled with meat will struggle to reach its set temperature. The duty cycles themselves are also problematic. The auger-on portion of the cycle is too long, allowing large amounts of pellets to pile up in the fire pot and ignite at once, causing sudden, sharp temperature swings.|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of StatisticsLeigh MurrayThis {{case study}} was {{motivated}} by the need for effective statistical analysis {{for a series of}} poultry feeding experiments conducted in 2006 by Kansas State University researchers in the department of Animal Science. Some of these experiments involved an automated <b>auger</b> <b>feed</b> line system commonly used in commercial broiler houses and continuous, proportion response data. Two of the feed line experiments are considered in this case study to determine if a statistical model using a non-normal response offers a better fit for this data than a model utilizing a normal approximation. The two experiments involve fixed as well as multiple random effects. In this case study, the data from these experiments is analyzed using a linear mixed model and Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM’s) with the SAS Glimmix procedure. Comparisons are made between a linear mixed model and GLMM’s using the beta and binomial responses. Since the response data is not count data a quasi-binomial approximation to the binomial is used to convert continuous proportions to the ratio of successes over total number of trials, N, for a variety of possible N values. Results from these analyses are compared on the basis of point estimates, confidence intervals and confidence interval widths, as well as p-values for tests of fixed effects. The investigation concludes that a GLMM may offer a better fit than models using a normal approximation for this data when sample sizes are small or response values are close to zero. This investigation discovers that these same instances can cause GLMM’s utilizing the beta response to behave poorly in the Glimmix procedure because lack of convergence issues prevent the obtainment of valid results. In such a case, a GLMM using a quasi-binomial response distribution with a high value of N can offer a reasonable and well behaved alternative to the beta distribution...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryR. Scott BeyerThe modern poultry {{industry}} uses <b>auger</b> <b>feed</b> lines to transport feed for broilers to pans to make feed available for them while greatly reducing labor costs. The feed given to broilers is manufactured at significant cost into a pelleted form. Pellets reduce broiler production costs by increasing feed intake and growth rate while reducing feed. Pellet quality is expressed using a method called the Pellet Durability Index (PDI). A {{series of studies}} was conducted {{to determine the effects}} of these destructive forces on both pellet quality and nutritive value. In Experiment 1, it was found that pellets of 78 and 86 PDI had 30 % more fines in the final pan compared to the initial pan, but there was no significant difference between the two diets. In Experiment 2, a significant difference existed between a 23 PDI diet and an 82 PDI diet in the percentage of fines found at 12 selected pans. This indicates destruction occurring along the length of the feed line. In Experiment 3, soybean oil was applied to the exterior of the pellets and they were transported through the feed line. A significant difference in the amount of fat at each collection site was found, as the fat was removed from the exterior of the pellets in earlier pans, indicating destructive forces having an effect on the pellets. In Experiment 4, whole sorghum was used to create four diets with similar PDI. The feed was then placed in the feed line, collected at twelve locations, and analyzed for crude fat, CP, DM, ash and Ca. The results indicated the presence of whole sorghum in the pellets had no effect on percent fines or nutrient values. In Experiment 5, three diets with different PDI were transported through the feed line. Five collection sites were selected. Results indicate that high quality pellets withstand handling while pellets below 68 PDI show increased fine percentage. These experiments indicate pellets are damaged during transport in the feed line, but nutrients remain the same unless they are on the exterior of the pellet...|$|R

(Young Scholars) Effects of feed truck {{unloading}} and swine barn {{feed line}} location on pellet quality and nutrient segregation. Journal of Animal Science, 94, 78 - 78. doi: 10. 2527 /msasas 2016 - 166 Two experiments were conducted at a commercial feed mill and 6 commercial wean to finish pig sites {{to determine the}} effects of <b>feed</b> truck unloading <b>auger</b> RPM on pellet quality and unloading time, and the effects of feed line location on pellet quality and nutrient concentration of intact pellets and their fines. In Exp. 1, pelleted feed was unloaded using 3 speeds (900, 1150, and 1400 RPM) from each of 8 compartments of a feed truck (Walinga Inc., Guelph, ON, Canada). Six samples per compartment were collected creating 16 replications/unloading speed. There was an unloading speed × trailer compartment interaction (P = 0. 031; SEM = 17. 4). The difference in unloading time from the front to rear compartment was greatest at the slowest unloading speed and similar at the 2 highest unloading speeds (70 vs. 35 and 37 s). The percentage of fines formed during unloading was not influenced by unloading speed, but tended to increase (quadratic; P = 0. 081; SEM = 2. 27) from the front (8. 2 %) to the rear compartment (10. 7 %). In Exp. 2, pelleted feed samples were collected during unloading into a commercial feed bin at 6 finishing pig sites with 2 feed lines, resulting in 12 replications per feed line location. Samples were collected from the feed line at 6, 35, and 76 m from the feed bin. There were no interactions between feed line location and nutrient profile of the fines and pellets. There was no effect of feed line location on pellet durability index, percentage fines, percentage fines formed, or the nutrient profile of pellets or fines. Across locations, fines had decreased (P < 0. 05) CP (12. 4 vs. 15. 3 %; SEM = 0. 14) and P (0. 37 vs. 0. 40 %; SEM = 0. 006), but greater (P < 0. 05) ADF (3. 7 vs. 3. 2 %; SEM = 0. 24), crude fiber (2. 7 vs. 2. 2 %; SEM = 0. 09), Ca (0. 47 vs. 0. 44 %; SEM = 0. 012), ether extract (6. 2 vs. 5. 2 %; SEM = 0. 11), and starch (47. 4 vs. 44. 7 %; SEM = 0. 42) for the fines and pellets, respectively. In conclusion, the front compartments closer to the truck cab resulted in fewer fines formed from loading to unloading. Decreasing unloading speed significantly increased the amount of time taken to unload a feed truck but did not alter fines formed. Feeder distance from the bin did not influence fines formation. There were significant differences in nutrient profile between fines and pellets. Understanding the location of fines creation during the feed delivery process may allow for alternative methods to reduce the formation of fines and subsequent nutrient segregation...|$|R
