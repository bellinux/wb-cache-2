5000|$|Adult <b>hyaline</b> {{articular}} <b>cartilage</b> is progressively mineralized at {{the junction}} between cartilage and bone. It is then termed articular calcified cartilage.

30|$|The {{layer of}} calcified {{cartilage}} in normal joints is more dense than bone and thinner than the overlying <b>hyaline</b> articular <b>cartilage</b> (ratio 10 : 1) (Burr 2004). In early OA, the calcified cartilage layer {{is subjected to}} increased endochondral ossification (Suri & Walsh 2012), most likely triggered by vascular invasion from the subchondral bone compartment. In addition, recent experimental data suggest that hypertrophic chondrocytes within the calcified cartilage may transdifferentiate into osteoblasts, thus directly obtaining the capacity for bone formation (Yang et al. 2014, Zhou et al. 2014). Such ossification results in an accelerated advancement and duplication of the tidemark with increased thickness of the calcified cartilage layer. This process may increase the mechanical stress in the deep zones of the <b>hyaline</b> articular <b>cartilage,</b> contributing to the acceleration of OA (Goldring & Goldring 2010).|$|R

25|$|A growth {{center is}} located in the head of each mandibular condyle before an {{individual}} reaches maturity. This growth center consists of <b>hyaline</b> <b>cartilage</b> underneath the periosteum on the articulating surface of the condyle. This is the last growth center of bone in the body and is multidirectional in its growth capacity, unlike a typical long bone. This area of cartilage within the bone grows in length by appositional growth as the individual grows to maturity. Over time, the cartilage is replaced by bone, using endochondral ossification. This mandibular growth center in the condyle allows the increased length of the mandible needed for the larger permanent teeth, {{as well as for the}} larger brain capacity of the adult. This growth of the mandible also influences the overall shape of the face, and thus is charted and referred to during orthodontic therapy. When an individual reaches full maturity, the growth center of bone within the condyle has disappeared.|$|E

Postnatal expression of this transgene resulted in pathological changes in articular cartilage of the mouse joints similar to those observed in human OA. These included characteristic erosion of the articular cartilage associated with loss of proteoglycan and excessive cleavage of type II collagen by collagenase, as well as synovial hyperplasia.

40|$|Defects of {{articular}} cartilage {{that do not}} penetrate to the subchondral bone fail to heal spontaneously. Defects that penetrate to the subchondral bone elicit an intrinsic repair response that yields a fibrocartilaginous repair tissue which is a poor substitute for <b>hyaline</b> articular <b>cartilage.</b> Many arthroscopic repair strategies employed utilise this intrinsic repair response to induce {{the formation of a}} repair tissue within the defect. The goal, however, is to produce a repair tissue that has the same functional and mechanical properties of <b>hyaline</b> articular <b>cartilage.</b> To this end, autologous osteochondral transfer can provide symptomatic relief. This technique involves the excision of healthy cartilage plugs from "non-load bearing" regions of the joint for implantation into the defect.

This technique again involves the excision of healthy cartilage from the joint for expansion.

40|$|Collagen-induced {{arthritis}} is an arthritic {{disease that}} can be induced in rodents and primates. It is used widely {{as a model of}} disease processes and potential therapies. The immunology of collagen arthritis has some compelling parallels with human disease and these have been exploited recently in several novel ways to analyse the nature of autoreactivity against joint antigens and to test new therapies. Antibodies against lymphocyte surface markers, such as CD 4, CD 40 L and MHC Class II, have been shown to suppress disease progression. Manipulation of cytokines, notably TNF-a, IL- 1 and IL- 2, has been extensively studied using the cytokines themselves, antibodies against cytokines and other antagonists with varied, but promising results. The search for antigen-specific immunosuppression has gained new impetus through manipulation of collagen arthritis by mucosal delivery of collagen to induce tolerance that suppresses disease. This review examines the salient features of collagen arthritis that are relevant to human disease and discusses the meaning and potential application of experimental therapies to the control of human arthritis.

40|$|Fibronectin {{is a major}} cell surface protein {{of normal}} {{fibroblasts}} (1 - 4) but is absent {{from the surface of}} transformed fibroblasts (2, 5 - 8). Fibronectin is also present in plasma (1, 9). It has affinity to fibrinogen and fibrin and is identical with cold insoluble globulin (10 - 12). A recent comparison of fibronectins derived from human plasma and fibroblasts by analysis ofpolypeptide chains, peptide maps, and amino acid and carbohydrate compositions, strongly suggests that they are the same protein (13). Fibronectin is present in the fibroblasts of different species as immunologically cross-reactive but not identical components (14). Recent results from our laboratory show that human fibronectin, whether derived from cultured fibroblasts or plasma, binds to collagen (15). During the past several years it has become clear that collagen exists as several distinct types determined by independent structural genes (16, 17). Type I collagen is the most prevalent form of collagen in the mature vertebrate organism and occurs in the arterial walls, bone, dentin, dermis, tendon, and uterine wall.

This study aimed to {{compare and contrast}} the immunohistochemical distribution of type IX collagen in normal mature and spontaneously osteoarthritic canine tibial cartilage. DESIGN: Thick vibratome sectioning techniques were evaluated and compared with isolated chondrons using a range of streptavidin-linked probes in combination with light, confocal and transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: In normal intact samples, type IX collagen was concentrated in the pericellular microenvironment, while a weaker extracellular reaction around each chondron separated the territorial matrix from the unstained interterritorial matrix. Further differentiation was evident in isolated chondrons where the fibrous pericellular capsule stained more intensely than the tail and interconnecting segments between columnated chondrons. Two regions of type IX reactivity were identified in osteoarthritic tissue: an intensely stained superficial reactive region below the eroding margins, and normal deep layer cartilage where pericellular staining persists. The superficial reactive region was characterized by chondron swelling and chondrocyte cluster formation, a loss of pericellular type IX staining, and {{a significant increase in}} matrix staining between clusters. Disintegration and loss of fibrillar collagens was evident in both the swollen microenvironment and adjacent territorial matrices.

A comprehensive set of such baseline data is, however, not available for humans. It was {{the purpose of the}} present study to furnish the necessary information. Design The articular cartilage layer covering the medial femoral condyle of deceased persons aged between 23 and 49 years was chosen for the morphometric analysis of cell parameters using confocal microscopy in conjunction with unbiased stereological methods. The height of the <b>hyaline</b> articular <b>cartilage</b> layer, as well as that of the calcified cartilage layer and the subchondral bone plate, were also measured. Results The mean height of the <b>hyaline</b> articular <b>cartilage</b> layer was found to be 2. 4 mm, the volume density of chondrocytes therein being 1. 65 %, the number of cells per mm 3 of tissue 9626 and the mean cell diameter 13 Î¼m.

Conclusions A comparison of these normal human quantitative data with those published for experimental animals commonly used in orthopaedic research reveals substantial differences, consideration of which in tissue engineering strategies destined for human application are of paramount importance for successful repair.
