Individual termites react rather than think, but at a group level, they exhibit a sort of collective cognition. Specific structures or other objects such as pellets of soil or pillars cause termites to start building. The termite adds these objects onto existing structures, and such behaviour encourages building behaviour in other workers. The result is a self-organised process whereby the information that directs termite activity results from changes in the environment rather than from direct contact among individuals.|$|E

The early Barth read at least three volumes of Kierkegaard’s works: Practice in Christianity, The Moment, and an Anthology from his journals and diaries. Almost all key terms from Kierkegaard which had {{an important role in}} The Epistle to the Romans can be found in Practice in Christianity. The concept of the <b>indirect</b> <b>communication,</b> the paradox, and the moment of Practice in Christianity, in particular, confirmed and sharpened Barth’s ideas on contemporary Christianity and the Christian life.|$|E
25|$|This {{brings us}} back to Wittgenstein's {{reliance}} on <b>indirect</b> <b>communication,</b> and his reliance on thought-experiments. Some philosophical confusions come about because we aren't able to see family resemblances. We've made a mistake in understanding the vague and intuitive rules that language uses, and have thereby tied ourselves up in philosophical knots. He suggests that an attempt to untangle these knots requires more than simple deductive arguments pointing out the problems with some particular position. Instead, Wittgenstein's larger goal is to try to divert us from our philosophical problems long enough to become aware of our intuitive ability to see the family resemblances.|$|E

He used <b>indirect</b> <b>communication</b> in the first book and direct communication {{in the rest of}} them. He doesn't believe the question about God's existence should be an opinion held by one group and differently by another no matter how many demonstrations are made. He says it's up to the single individual to make the fruit of the Holy Spirit real because love and joy are always just possibilities. Christendom wanted to define God's attributes once and for all but Kierkegaard was against this. His love for Regine was a disaster but it helped him because of his point of view.|$|E

25|$|On 16 October 1843, Kierkegaard {{published}} {{three more}} books {{about love and}} faith and several more discourses. Fear and Trembling was published under the pseudonym Johannes de Silentio. Repetition is about a Young Man (Søren Kierkegaard) who has anxiety and depression because he feels he has to sacrifice his love for a girl (Regine Olsen) to God. He tries {{to see if the}} new science of psychology can help him understand himself. Constantin Constantius, who is the pseudonymous author of that book, is the psychologist. At the same time, he published Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 under his own name, which dealt specifically with how love can be used to hide things from yourself or others. These three books, all published on the same day, are an example of Kierkegaard's method of <b>indirect</b> <b>communication.</b>|$|E

He coins the concept of the [...] "paradox of faith" [...] since the form of faith entails a contradictory encounter of God and human beings. He also portrayed the contemporaneity of the moment when in crisis a human being desperately perceives the contemporaneity of Christ. In regard to the concept of <b>indirect</b> <b>communication,</b> the paradox, and the moment, the Kierkegaard of the early Barth is a productive catalyst.|$|E

For months, Kierkegaard perceived himself to be the victim of harassment {{on the streets of}} Denmark. In a journal entry dated 9 March 1846, Kierkegaard made a long, detailed explanation of his attack on Møller and The Corsair, and also explained that this attack made him rethink his strategy of <b>indirect</b> <b>communication.</b>|$|E

40|$|Instagram {{has become}} one of the fastest {{upcoming}} social platforms and with the release of video in 2013 several companies has discovered the vast opportunities on the platform. This paper concerns the communication strategy of a company using the social media Instagram. The Danish company in question is Streetammo, as this company with its more than 23. 000 followers on Instagram, is a very interesting case. With two stores, respectively in Aarhus and Aalborg and an online web shop, Streetammo has achieved great success with their own clothing brand and a close cooperation with the Danish brand CHEFF Records. The company was chosen because of its fast growth and the intriguing way of using the concerned social media. Therefore the paper wishes to achieve an understanding of how Streetammo uses Instagram in the branding of the company and furthermore see how users of Instagram interpret this. Two focus group interviews representing users of Instagram were conducted to determine perceptions toward the company’s use of Instagram. By having two interviews with the same number of informants and identical questions, it was possible to compare answers and experiences drawn from the different social constructions of the focus group interviews. The fundamental basis of this paper is of a socio-constructive perspective, why the interviews were conducted as a focus group, as social constructivism emphasises the importance of context and culture. An analysis of Streetammo’s branding on Instagram has been carried out upon the observations drawn from the focus group interviews and with the application of various theoretical perspectives. Through the analysis it is evident that the company uses two overriding communication strategies, concerning direct and <b>indirect</b> sales <b>communication.</b> Hence the first mentioned strategy having the purpose of creating a direct sale, where <b>indirect</b> sales <b>communication</b> concerns the involvement of Instagram’s users. In additional to the strategy of <b>indirect</b> sales <b>communication</b> it became clear that Streetammo applies communication through the narrative content and personification of the company, where the communication strategy regarding co-branding and the aesthetic aspects associates to a specific lifestyle. Even though the informants appreciated elements in Streetammo’s way of branding on Instagram, many revealed a lack of interest when asked if they wished to continue following the company in the future. Through the use of Streetammo’s communication strategies, they favour a specific audience, where Instagram is a discovering platform, as users continuously wishes to be inspired, and companies using Instagram should therefore target a wide segment...|$|R

But Kierkegaard stressed the single individual in the presence of God in time in his early discourses and wrote against speculative arguments about whether or not one individual, no matter how gifted, can ascertain where another stood in relation to God as early as his Two Upbuilding Discourses of 1843 where he wrote against listening to speculative Christians: ...|$|E

The church's view is that, following these Biblical examples, its ministers have no permanent dwelling places, minister in pairs, sell all and go out with only minimal worldly possessions, and rely only upon hospitality and generosity.

Each single individual has a future and {{there comes a time when}} a decision is made that can have long-lasting effects.

2500|$|Kierkegaard {{never fully}} {{recovered}} from his failed relationship with Regine. [...] For {{a time in}} between their break-up and her marriage to Schlegel, they had polite and civil contact during daily walks and in church. [...] These were mostly non-verbal on Kierkegaard's part and caused him great anxiety. [...] It seems that he was attempting to utilize his complicated authorial method of <b>indirect</b> <b>communication</b> in his personal life, and his tormented approach caused him great distress. [...] When he absconded to Berlin in 1842 to study philosophy, he was haunted {{by a woman who}} bore an uncanny resemblance to Regine. Even while immersing himself in his studies, Regine was always on his mind: [...] "Not even here in Berlin has my, alas, all-too-inventive brain been able to refrain from scheming something or other. She must either love me or hate me, she knows no third possibility. Nor is there anything more harmful to a young girl than half-way situations."

2500|$|Kierkegaard {{published}} some of {{his works}} using pseudonyms and for others he signed his own name as author. Whether being published under pseudonym or not, Kierkegaard's central writings on religion have included Fear and Trembling and Either/Or, the latter of which {{is considered to be}} his magnum opus. Pseudonyms were used often in the early 19th century as a means of representing viewpoints other than the author's own; examples include the writers of the Federalist Papers and the Anti-Federalist Papers. [...] Kierkegaard employed the same technique as a way to provide examples of <b>indirect</b> <b>communication.</b> In writing under various pseudonyms to express sometimes contradictory positions, Kierkegaard is sometimes criticized for playing with various viewpoints without ever committing to one in particular.

This profile of a more outgoing person is consistent with the results showing that those from the United States have higher levels of social self-efficacy. Given the results showing that collectivistic Syrians have higher levels of general self-efficacy, they should be able to adapt to unfamiliar communication patterns given general self-efficacy’s link to optimism, self-regulation, and self-esteem (Luszczynska et al. 2005).|$|R

At the same time he would have liked a provision for sending a delegation to Westminster on occasion, with reference to some definite Irish questions such as might be expected to arise. As to the composition of the upper or protective order in the Irish parliament, he was wholly unfamiliar with the various utopian plans that have been advanced for the protection of minorities, and he declared himself tolerably indifferent whether the object should be sought in nomination by the crown, or through a special and narrower elective body, or by any other scheme. To such things he had given no thought. He was a party chief, not a maker of constitutions. He liked the idea of both orders sitting in one House.

So it happened, and the door that had thus been shut, speedily opened. <b>Indirect</b> <b>communication</b> reached the treasury bench that seemed to show the leaders of opposition to be again alive. There were many surmises, everybody was excited, and two great tory leaders in the Lords called on Lord Granville one day, anxious for a modus vivendi. Mr. Gladstone in the Commons, in conformity with a previous decision of the cabinet, declared the willingness of the government to produce a bill or explain its provisions, on receiving a reasonable guarantee that the Franchise bill would be passed {{before the end of the}} sittings. The ultras of the opposition still insisted on making bets all round that the Franchise bill would not become law; besides betting, they declared they would die on the floor of the House in resisting an accommodation. A meeting of the party was summoned at the Carlton club for the purpose of declaring war to the knife, and Lord Salisbury was reported to hold to his determination. This resolve, however, proved to have been shaken by Mr. Gladstone’s language on a previous day. The general principles of redistribution had been sufficiently sifted, tested, and compared to show that there was no insuperable discrepancy of view. It was made clear to Lord Salisbury circuitously, that though the government required adequate assurances of the safety of franchise before presenting their scheme upon seats, this did not preclude private and confidential illumination. So the bill was read a second time.|$|E
