The most significant <b>economic</b> <b>activities</b> in the Primorje-Gorski Kotar County are transport, largely based on activities of the Port of Rijeka, shipbuilding and tourism in the coastal areas representing a part of the Northern Croatian Littoral, and forestry and wood processing in the Gorski Kotar region in the hinterland. In the city of Rijeka itself, the most significant <b>economic</b> <b>activities</b> are civil engineering, wholesale and retail trade, transport and storage services, and the processing industry.

40|$|The {{notion that}} {{financial}} asset returns are predictors of future <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> is widespread, but detailed analyses provide little support for financial markets ability to reveal future <b>economic</b> <b>activity.</b> Even though {{the evidence on}} various indicators used by different researchers is mixed, {{the authors of this}} article explore the notion that financial markets reveal useful information about future <b>economic</b> <b>activity.</b> This article examines and answers two questions: First, what is a good way of extracting information about future <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> from asset prices?

To determine whether news of an assets excess return can reveal information about unexpected <b>economic</b> <b>activity,</b> the authors construct a method of extracting the news about future <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> from returns on financial assets.
