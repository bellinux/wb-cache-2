5|$|Weber also {{proposed}} a socioevolutionary model of religious change, showing that in general, societies <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> magic to polytheism, then to pantheism, monotheism and finally, ethical monotheism. According to Weber, this evolution occurred as the growing economic stability allowed professionalisation {{and the evolution}} of ever more sophisticated priesthood. As societies grew more complex and encompassed different groups, a hierarchy of gods developed and as power in the society became more centralised, the concept of a single, universal God became more popular and desirable.|$|E

25|$|Robert Stone (29 January 1749 – June 1820) was an English {{first-class}} cricketer with amateur status.

The full span of his career is uncertain but he was definitely active between 1773 and 1780, playing in eight first-class matches. According to CricketArchive, Stone resurrected his career with two further matches in the 1790 season, but it cannot be said with certainty that this was the same man, especially as he seems to <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> Surrey to Kent.|$|E

25|$|The {{purpose and}} {{benefit of the}} paralysing toxin is not clear. Being arachnids, ticks are related to predatory {{arthropods}} (spiders, scorpions and mites). Spiders and scorpions have retained toxins and developed specialised delivery structures (fangs and telsons) while mites and ticks have lost this feature. Of the 800 species of ticks, 40-64 species (across 10 genera) have been reported as causing a form of toxosis. So as ticks <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> a predatory existence to a parasitic existence, most species have lost their toxin {{which would have been}} a disadvantage for a parasitic lifestyle (parasites in general do not want to kill their host). Gene sequence of the tick toxin shows high homology to scorpion toxins.|$|E
25|$|White {{flight in}} Norway has {{increased}} in the 1970s with the immigration of non-Scandinavians from (in numerical order, starting with the largest): Poland, Pakistan, Iraq, Somalia, Vietnam, Iran, Turkey, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Russia, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, the former Yugoslavia, Thailand, Afghanistan, and Lithuania. By June 2009, more than 40% of Oslo schools had an immigrant majority, with some schools having a 97% immigrant share. Schools in Oslo are increasingly divided by ethnicity. For instance, in the Groruddalen (Grorud valley), four boroughs which currently {{has a population of}} around 165,000, the ethnic Norwegian population decreased by 1,500 in 2008, while the immigrant population increased by 1,600.

25|$|The rock {{inscription}} {{near the}} south-eastern part of Boyukdash's foot (70 km from Baku) was discovered on June 2, 1948 by Azerbaijani archaeologist Ishag Jafarzadeh. The legend is IMPDOMITIANO CAESARE·AVG GERMANIC L·IVLIVS MAXIMVS> LEG XII·FVL. According to Domitian's titles in it, the related march {{took place between}} 84 and 96. The inscription was studied by Russian expert Yevgeni Pakhomov, who assumed that the associated campaign was launched to control the Derbent Gate and that the XII Fulminata has marched out either from Melitene, its permanent base, or Armenia, where it might <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> before. Pakhomov supposed that the legion proceeded to the spot continually along the Aras River. The later version, published in 1956, states that the legion was stationing in Cappadocia by that time whereas the centurion {{might have been in}} Albania with some diplomatic mission because for the talks with the Eastern rulers the Roman commanders were usually sending centurions.|$|E
