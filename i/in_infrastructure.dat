40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the regional incidence of the effects of public investment <b>in</b> transportation <b>infrastructures</b> <b>in</b> Portugal. Our methodological approach consists of estimating vector autoregressive (VAR) models for the national economy as well as for each of the five administrative regions in the country. In the regional models, both public investment <b>in</b> transportation <b>infrastructures</b> <b>in</b> the region and public investment <b>in</b> transportation <b>infrastructures</b> elsewhere are considered, thereby taking into consideration the potential existence of regional spillovers. Empirical results suggest that although public investment <b>in</b> transportation <b>infrastructures</b> has been a powerful instrument to promote long-term growth, it does so in a way that is rather unbalanced across regions. We show that public investment <b>in</b> transportation <b>infrastructures</b> has markedly contributed to the concentration of economic activity in Lisbon, the largest region in the country, and therefore has contributed markedly to the macrocephaly of the countr...|$|R

40|$|In {{the first}} essay we examine optimal {{investment}} <b>in</b> public <b>infrastructure</b> when used to attract {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI). We model a monopolistic multinational firm that wants to establish its production plant {{in one of two}} prospective host countries with segmented markets, hence there is no arbitrage between the markets. Preceding the firm 2 ̆ 7 s location decision, the government of one of the prospective host countries invests <b>in</b> public <b>infrastructure,</b> while the other prospective host government is policy inactive. We identify country characteristics that make a government more likely to use investment <b>in</b> public <b>infrastructure</b> to attract FDI. We find that countries with a large market size, low social cost of public funds, large direct social benefits and high effectiveness of public infrastructure {{are most likely to be}} successful in attracting FDI into their jurisdiction by investing <b>in</b> public <b>infrastructure.</b> We also examine the effect of trade liberalisation between the two markets on optimal investment <b>in</b> public <b>infrastructure.</b> We find that a non-monotonic relationship exists between trade costs and optimal investment <b>in</b> public <b>infrastructure.</b> <b>In</b> the second essay we use a similar set-up as in the first essay. However, we now explicitly introduce domestic firms into the model. Simultaneously to the MNE 2 ̆ 7 s location decision, these firms, also benefiting from the investment <b>in</b> public <b>infrastructure,</b> decide whether to remain producers for the domestic market only or to become exporters instead. We show that, under certain conditions, a government that invests <b>in</b> public <b>infrastructure</b> to attract foreign direct investment through manipulation, may at the same time turn its domestic firms into exporters. The third essay models a competition - for - FDI game between governments that use different policy instruments: one government invests <b>in</b> public <b>infrastructure,</b> while the other uses its corporate tax rate to entice foreign firms. We model a monopolistic multinational firm, considering to set up a plant in one of two prospective host countries with segmented markets. Governments set policies before the multinational chooses its production location. Also, the government that invests <b>in</b> public <b>infrastructure</b> determines its policy prior to the other government setting its corporate tax rate. When governments compete, there is likely to be a race to the bottom" in taxes and a race to the top" <b>in</b> public <b>infrastructure</b> investment. <b>In</b> the final essay we set up a two-stage game in which two governments, competing for FDI, both invest <b>in</b> public <b>infrastructure</b> and set corporate tax rates. We investigate how public infrastructural investment affects tax competition. We assume that investment <b>in</b> public <b>infrastructure</b> by one country may generate spillovers - positive or negative - for the other country. When the infrastructure investment implies significantly negative spillovers for competing host countries, the investing government will strategically under-invest to ease tax competition, while it will strategically over-invest when the spillovers are negative but small or when these are positive. We also examine how two different forms of tax harmonisation affect investment <b>in</b> public <b>infrastructure.</b> Tax harmonisation <b>in</b> the form of a minimum tax can eliminate strategic investment <b>in</b> public <b>infrastructure.</b> While tax harmonisation in the form of a cooperative tax will result in higher taxes. Furthermore, the level of investment <b>in</b> public <b>infrastructure</b> will also be higher...|$|R

5|$|By the 1850s, Calcutta had two areas: White Town, {{which was}} {{primarily}} British and centred on Chowringhee and Dalhousie Square; and Black Town, mainly Indian and centred on North Calcutta. The city underwent rapid industrial growth {{starting in the}} early 1850s, especially in the textile and jute industries; this encouraged British companies to massively invest <b>in</b> <b>infrastructure</b> projects, which included telegraph connections and Howrah railway station. The coalescence of British and Indian culture resulted {{in the emergence of}} a new babu class of urbane Indians, whose members were often bureaucrats, professionals, newspaper readers, and Anglophiles; they usually belonged to upper-caste Hindu communities. In the 19th century, the Bengal Renaissance brought about an increased sociocultural sophistication among city denizens.

5|$|The {{convenient}} {{location of}} these caves near Mumbai, the Western curiosity for the historic Indian culture, {{and the difficulty}} in reaching sites <b>in</b> <b>infrastructure</b> poor Indian subcontinent, made Elephanta Caves a subject of numerous guide books and significant scholarly interest in the 20th century. The early speculations and misconceptions about these caves led to many interpretations and scholarly disagreements but also increased the support for their preservation. The publication of their condition, sketches and interpretation by James Burgess in 1871 brought wider attention. The earliest efforts to preserve the Elephanta Caves were taken by British India officials in 1909, when the site was placed under the Indian Archaeological Department and the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act included it within its scope.
