50|$|Interest {{expenses}} {{are part of}} the group's total income. Thus, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>ensured</b> <b>that</b> the actual costs are deducted (net principle). Tax arbitrage is not possible because business expenses do reduce the income of all companies proportionately to their respective share of the overall profit. Companies cannot claim expenses in a high-tax jurisdiction, while profits are taxed in low-tax jurisdictions. However, tax arbitrage is possible in the case of subsidiaries located in third countries. Consequently, the European Commission proposes to introduce an anti-abuse rule which limits the interest deductibility.|$|E

The higher plant productivity of SBP implies increased atmospheric carbon capture through photosynthesis. Part of the biomass produced is stored in soils due to the high density of yearly renewed roots. Storage {{is in the form}} of non-labile soil organic carbon (SOC), which is part of the soil organic matter (SOM) pools. SOM pools are also increased by leaves’ senescence, and by animals returning undigested fibre to the soil.|$|E
