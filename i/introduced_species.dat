5|$|An {{invasive}} species is a plant, fungus, or animal species {{that is not}} native to a specific location (an <b>introduced</b> <b>species),</b> and which {{has a tendency to}} spread to a degree believed to cause damage to the environment, human economy or human health.|$|E
5|$|Another {{threat to}} {{albatrosses}} is <b>introduced</b> <b>species,</b> such as rats or feral cats, which directly attack albatrosses or their chicks and eggs. Albatrosses {{have evolved to}} breed on islands where land mammals are absent and have not developed defences against them. Even species as small as mice can be detrimental; on Gough Island the chicks of Tristan albatrosses are attacked and eaten alive by introduced house mice. <b>Introduced</b> <b>species</b> can have other indirect effects: cattle overgrazed essential cover on Amsterdam Island, threatening the Amsterdam albatross; on other islands introduced plants reduce potential nesting habitat.|$|E
5|$|Importation or {{classical}} {{biological control}} involves {{the introduction of}} a pest's natural enemies to a new locale where they do not occur naturally. Early instances were often unofficial and not based on research, and some <b>introduced</b> <b>species</b> became serious pests themselves.|$|E
40|$|<b>Introduced</b> marine <b>species</b> {{can have}} a large impact upon small {{countries}} that are reliant on marine tourism. Non-governmental organisations, such as the World Conservation Union (IUCN), are working with technical experts to implement capacity building and awareness programs that transfers <b>introduced</b> marine <b>species</b> knowledge to countries in need of aid. The Republic of Palau is reliant on tourism and as such is proactively engaging in this process {{to ensure that it}} has the necessary skills to determine and manage its <b>introduced</b> marine <b>species</b> pathways and vectors. The IUCN with the aid of technical experts implemented a four day training workshop that provided both theoretical and practical field experience with <b>introduced</b> marine <b>species</b> port surveys. An outcome of this exercise was the detection of 11 <b>introduced</b> marine <b>species,</b> the training of 10 Palau agencies and two international organisations, and recommendations for future implementation that will aid Palau {{to address the problem of}} <b>introduced</b> marine <b>species</b> within their borders...|$|R

50|$|The {{implications}} of invasive species {{and the use}} of biological control agents may also be closely related to the idea of cross-boundary subsidies. <b>Introducing</b> <b>species</b> into one patch for biocontrol may have unforeseen consequences on dynamics within adjacent patches.|$|R
5|$|Invertebrate {{introductions}} {{have had}} an observable effect on Puerto Rican fauna. Native freshwater snails such as Physa cubensis have been adversely affected by <b>introduced</b> <b>species.</b> Currently, the most abundant freshwater snail in Puerto Rico is the Quilted Melania (Tarebia granifera), an <b>introduced</b> <b>species.</b> Another invertebrate introduced to Puerto Rico is the honeybee. This animal competes with the endangered Puerto Rican parrot for secondary nesting cavities at the Caribbean National Forest. Africanized bees, which pose an even greater threat for secondary cavity nesters, have recently extended their range to Puerto Rico. Other introductions include 18 species of ant, {{one of the most}} abundant taxa in leaf litter habitats.|$|E

5|$|Several common {{birds in}} North America, {{such as the}} house sparrow, the rock pigeon, the European {{starling}} and the mute swan are <b>introduced</b> <b>species,</b> meaning {{that they are not}} native to this continent but were brought here by humans from Europe or elsewhere. <b>Introduced</b> <b>species</b> are marked on this list as (I). There may be species that have individual escapees or small feral populations in North America that are not on this list. This is especially true of birds that are commonly held as pets, such as parrots and finches.|$|E

5|$|The {{cane toad}} has been {{introduced}} to many regions of the worldparticularly the Pacificfor the biological control of agricultural pests.

5|$|The {{following}} <b>introduced</b> <b>species,</b> {{while not}} considered officially {{established by the}} FOSRC, have self-sustaining populations and, within range and proper habitat, {{are likely to be}} encountered.|$|E
5|$|Virtually {{the entire}} land {{area of the}} islands is used as pasture for sheep. <b>Introduced</b> <b>species</b> include reindeer, hares, rabbits, Patagonian foxes, brown rats and cats. The {{detrimental}} impact several of these species have caused to native flora and fauna has led authorities to attempt to contain, remove or exterminate invasive species such as foxes, rabbits and rats. Endemic land animals {{have been the most}} affected by <b>introduced</b> <b>species.</b> The extent of human impact on the Falklands is unclear, since there is little long-term data on habitat change.|$|E
50|$|Every single larger upland {{river and}} stream in {{south-eastern}} Australia {{is dominated by}} <b>introduced</b> trout <b>species</b> (rainbow trout and brown trout), with many having been continually stocked with <b>introduced</b> trout <b>species</b> {{for more than a}} century, and not a single larger upland river or stream in south-eastern Australia has been reserved in a trout-free state for larger upland native fish species. The effects of this course of action by fishery departments has been stark, and catastrophic events such as drought or bushfire, after which <b>introduced</b> trout <b>species</b> were restocked but upland native fish were not restocked, have shifted the balance further. The net result is that a number of upland native fish species including trout cod (and Macquarie perch) have completely died out or nearly so in their upland river habitats in the wild, apparently unable to cope with massive predation on their larvae/juveniles by <b>introduced</b> trout <b>species</b> and unable to cope with massive competition from <b>introduced</b> trout <b>species</b> for food and habitat at all life stages.|$|R
40|$|The {{perception}} of ecological risks (impact and acceptability) associated with <b>introduced</b> marine <b>species</b> (IMS), what demographic variables influence those perceptions, respondent’s knowledge of IMS, and people’s support for controlling <b>introduced</b> marine <b>species</b> {{impacts on the}} marine environment was explored at three locations in Western Australia: Ningaloo Reef Marine Park, Rottnest Island Marine Reserve, and Hamelin Bay. Recognition that <b>introduced</b> marine <b>species</b> are an issue at state, national and international levels exists; yet often marine protected area management plans do not reflect this recognition. Therefore, we hypothesise {{that there is a}} lack of translation of concern regarding <b>introduced</b> marine <b>species</b> as a risk into tactical objectives within marine protected area management plans. This may be due to low stakeholder perceptions of the risk posed by <b>introduced</b> marine <b>species.</b> Survey respondents had a high level (89 %) of self-rated awareness ofintroduced marine species and they also indicated (93 %) a willingness to support management interventions to prevent, or control the spread of <b>introduced</b> marine <b>species</b> in Western Australia. Our results also indicate that gender (males) and age (18 – 45 age group) influenced respondents’ {{perception of}} risk (impact) of IMS, yet no examined demographic variables influenced respondents acceptability of risk. Furthermore, knowledge of <b>introduced</b> marine <b>species,</b> education level, and income variables did not influence respondents’ perception of risk (impact or acceptability). Understanding demographic characteristics that influence participants perceptions related to <b>introduced</b> marine <b>species</b> can be useful for targeted, educational initiatives to reduce the likelihood of IMS incursions. This begins to smooth the way for management to proactively develop and implement policies that are necessary to more fully protect the Western Australian marine environment...|$|R

5|$|According to the IUCN, 97 {{freshwater}} fish species from the Western Ghats were considered threatened in 2011, including 12 critically endangered, 54 endangered and 31 vulnerable. All but one (Tor khudree) {{of these are}} endemic to the Western Ghats. An additional 26 species from the region are considered data deficient (their status is unclear at present). The primary threats are from habitat loss, but also from overexploitation and <b>introduced</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E
5|$|Both Douglas fir and Suillus lakei are {{non-native}} <b>introduced</b> <b>species</b> in Europe. The fungus {{has been}} found in several central and south European countries following the intentional introduction of Douglas fir. These include Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy, and Slovakia. It is considered endangered in the Czech Republic. Suillus lakei has also been reported in the South Island of New Zealand, and South America (Argentina and Chile).|$|E
5|$|Fauna is sparse on {{the island}} due to a {{combination}} of a lack of vegetation and the consequences of phosphates mining. Many indigenous birds have disappeared or become rare owing to destruction of their habitat. There are about 60recorded vascular plant species native to the island, none of which are endemic. Coconut farming, mining, and <b>introduced</b> <b>species</b> have caused serious disturbance to the native vegetation.|$|E
50|$|Some Star Trek plots <b>introduce</b> <b>species</b> {{that have}} sex, gender, or sexual identities {{outside of the}} gender binary and cisnormativity {{associated}} with humans. Agendered, monogendered, bigendered, trigendered, and pangendered species, each with unique or uncommon sexual reproductive methods, have been portrayed as having distinctly non-human assignment of reproductive responsibilities.|$|R
40|$|Data {{collected}} from 20 major river basins between 1993 and 1995 {{as part of}} the US Geological Survey’s (USGS) National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program were analyzed to assess patterns in introduced and native fish species richness and abundance relative to watershed characteristics and stream physicochemistry. Sites (N = 157) were divided into three regions-northeast, southeast, and west- to account for major longitudinal differences in precipitation/runoff and latitudinal limits of glaciation that affect zoogeographic patterns in fish communities. Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) were the most frequently collected <b>introduced</b> fish <b>species</b> across all river basins combined. Based on the percentage of <b>introduced</b> fish <b>species,</b> the fish communities most altered by the presence of introduced fish occurred in the western and northeastern parts of the US. Native fish species richness was not an indicator of <b>introduced</b> fish <b>species</b> richness for any of the three regions. However, in the west, <b>introduced</b> fish <b>species</b> richness was an indicator of total fish species richness and the abundance of introduced fish was negatively related to native fish species richness. Some relations between <b>introduced</b> fish <b>species</b> and environmental conditions were common between regions. Increased <b>introduced</b> fish <b>species</b> richness was related to increased population density in the northeast and southeast; increased total nitrogen in the northeast and west; and increased total phosphorous and water temperature in the southeast and west. These results suggest that <b>introduced</b> fish <b>species</b> tend to be associated with disturbance at large geographic scales, though specific relations may vary regionally...|$|R

5|$|First, Second and Third Creeks {{have been}} {{particularly}} heavily modified. Some sections have been converted to concrete channels; others run through landscaped private gardens and some run in underground pipes. Much of the original vegetation has disappeared from the creeks, particularly those closest to the city. <b>Introduced</b> <b>species</b> including Olives, bamboo, boxthorn, watsonia and blackberries have displaced native flora.|$|E
5|$|Hybridization {{is greatly}} {{influenced}} by human impact on the environment, through effects such as habitat fragmentation and species introductions. Such impacts {{make it difficult to}} conserve the genetics of populations undergoing introgressive hybridization. Humans have <b>introduced</b> <b>species</b> worldwide to environments for a long time, both intentionally for purposes such as biological control, and unintentionally, as with accidental escapes of individuals. Introductions can drastically affect populations, including through hybridization.|$|E
5|$|Many procellariids have {{breeding}} {{populations of}} over several million pairs; others number fewer than 200 birds. Humans have traditionally exploited {{several species of}} fulmar and shearwater (known as muttonbirds) for food, fuel, and bait, a practice that continues in a controlled fashion today.
