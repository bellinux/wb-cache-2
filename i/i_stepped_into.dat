[...] "On August 15th, at noon in broad daylight when everybody was eating lunch, I hit the road. Yes, I was afraid. Am I gonna live or die? And when <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the minefield and I seen it with my own eyes, I started sweating. I crossed over, looking for my new life." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{album is}} DeBarge's first studio release in 16 years, {{following}} {{a period of}} drug addiction and legal problems. After his release from prison in 2009, he was introduced by his manager, Pete Farmer, to music executives Ron Fair and Jimmy Iovine at Geffen and Interscope Records. DeBarge sang a cappella in his audition for the label. He later said of the meeting and audition, [...] "we put a plan together and the minute <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the studio I was so nervous, but I felt so much power just coming through me soon as I hit the microphone it was like, it was still there". He subsequently signed a recording deal with the label and began working on Second Chance.|$|E
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the apartment, {{guards and}} prisoners saw me simultaneously.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right,--as soon as Parliament meets {{and a new}} writ can be issued, Clavering retires, and <b>I</b> <b>step</b> <b>into</b> his shoes," [...] says Pen.|$|R
6000|$|... "They are not elaborate, Monsieur, {{but they}} are complete. When I leave you <b>I</b> <b>step</b> <b>into</b> a pirogue which {{is tied to the}} river bank." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “I am sure I will be punched like a bag. Like I am {{a pillow}} being pummeled...whether I win a medal or not, I {{will be a}} symbol of courage as soon as <b>I</b> <b>step</b> <b>into</b> the ring.” ...|$|R
60|$|So <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> {{the shining}} {{circle of the}} {{electric}} light and halted again.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a little}} gray in the sky now; so <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the woods, and laid down for a nap before breakfast.|$|E
60|$|I {{paused for}} a moment to give some {{instructions}} about my own luggage. Then <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the lift with the clerk and her.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{nonsense}} of fellows like Tip Chipmunk!" [...] said Featherhead to his admiring {{brothers and}} sisters--"the perfectly stupid nonsense! There he goes, delving and poking, {{picking up a}} nut here and a grain there, when <b>I</b> <b>step</b> <b>into</b> property at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait here, and I {{will go up}} gently {{towards the}} window. She may see me. She will see me as <b>I</b> <b>step</b> <b>into</b> the moonlight. At least I know an air by which she will {{recognize}} me, if I do but hum a stave." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "About {{four in the}} {{afternoon}} a soldier in red trousers brings a paper round to the jail, and they unlocks the door and I walks out. The guard at the door bows and I bows, and <b>I</b> <b>steps</b> <b>into</b> the grass and wades around to Doc Millikin's shack.|$|R
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> {{the circle}} where Madam Mina slept, she woke from her sleep and, seeing me, {{cried out in}} pain that I had endured too much.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned her}} head swiftly in my direction; {{it was the only}} sign of {{surprise}} she deigned to make. At the same time <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the light and bowed profoundly.|$|E
60|$|I {{came down}} the hill in {{the cool of the}} afternoon. Suddenly, out of the cedar-brake <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> a {{beautiful}} green valley where a tributary small stream ran into the Alamito River.|$|E
60|$|He glanced slyly at Comyn, and his Lordship {{laughed a}} little. <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> unsuspectingly <b>into</b> the office.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all! I don't want {{to spoil}} a {{perfectly}} good Spring afternoon for you by pulling out the tragic stop. I had to say all that; but it's the last time. It shan't occur again. There will be no tragedy when <b>I</b> <b>step</b> <b>into</b> the train to-morrow. Is there any chance that you might come and see me off?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> back <b>into</b> {{the little}} hall. They were talking {{together}} earnestly. Arthur {{looked up and}} glared at me.|$|R
6000|$|Countess. Why, yes! When in {{the instant}} after you [...] <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the room, and found my niece there, [...] What she in this first moment of the heart [...] Ta'en with surprise-- ...|$|E
60|$|There was {{no sound}} save the moaning of {{the wind in the}} bare trees which stood {{by the side of the}} house and the patter of the fast-falling rain. <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the {{carriage}} and the Count came to the window to me.|$|E
6000|$|This {{reception}} {{was something}} novel to me, who had cycled {{over thousands of}} miles, and I {{was not at all}} inclined to accept it {{at the hands of the}} boy. <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the hall. [...] "Can I see the master of this house?" [...] said I.|$|E
60|$|And then quite {{suddenly}} <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> out <b>into</b> space. Wildly I {{turned and}} clutched {{at the ground}} that had slipped from beneath my feet.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Reading?’ repeats Edwin Drood, with a {{touch of}} contempt. ‘No. Doing, working, engineering. My small {{patrimony}} was left a part of the capital of the Firm I am with, by my father, a former partner; and I am a charge upon the Firm until I come of age; and then <b>I</b> <b>step</b> <b>into</b> my modest share in the concern. Jack—you met him at dinner—is, until then, my guardian and trustee.’ ...|$|R
5000|$|When <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> out <b>into</b> {{the bright}} sunlight, from the {{darkness}} of the movie house, I had only two things on my mind. (S. E. Hinton, The Outsiders) ...|$|R
60|$|In {{opening the}} door of communication, it {{appeared}} as if I had also opened all the doors of all the bedchambers in the rectory. The moment <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the passage, out popped the children from one room after another, like rabbits out of their burrows.|$|E
6000|$|... "While High was {{examining}} some hieroglyphics on {{the wall}} that the stone-masons must have made when their tools slipped, <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the front room. That was at least thirty by fifty feet, stone floor, six little windows like square port-holes that didn't let much light in.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dresses ARE nice. I love pretty things. I {{remember}} the first pretty dress I ever had--the brown gloria Matthew gave me for our school concert. Before that everything I had was so ugly. It {{seemed to me that}} <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> a new world that night." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> out <b>into</b> the lamplight, saying: [...] "You {{need not}} search far. With your permission, Miss Carrington! Now I am only a guest here. Will you follow me?" ...|$|R
60|$|Yvonne's adieu {{was cold}} and formal--so cold and formal {{that it seemed to}} rob the {{sunshine}} of its glory for me as <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> out <b>into</b> the open air.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{he is not}} in," [...] said I. [...] "I {{remember}} your phrase of old, John. Come, <b>I</b> will <b>step</b> <b>into</b> his room, and leave a line for him." ...|$|R
60|$|The door closed; {{they were}} gone. I was ashamed: I {{was the only}} friend of the dying man that had no spirit, no courage. <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the room, and said I would be a man and would follow. But we are made as we are made, and we cannot help it. I did not go.|$|E
60|$|I {{smile as}} I recall {{the feeling of}} pride with which <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the 'bus {{and started for the}} Grand Central Hotel. And yet, after all, values are relative. That boy had {{something}} which I have lost. I would give much of my present knowledge of the world for the keen savor of life which filled my nostrils at that time.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{afternoon}} <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> {{a nest of}} wasps, but the thoughtless creatures {{flew away}} without stinging me. Then I met a fierce tiger, and my heart grew light and gay. 'Surely this will cause me suffering!' I cried, and advanced swiftly upon the brute. But the cowardly tiger turned tail and ran {{to hide in the}} bushes, leaving me unhurt! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was a {{great deal}} more disgusted than surprised," [...] she said rather indignantly. [...] "I did not think that it was fair at all that <b>I</b> should <b>step</b> <b>into</b> Mark's shoes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think <b>I</b> will <b>step</b> <b>into</b> Ellen's bedchamber," [...] said Mrs. Melmoth, [...] "and inquire how {{she feels}} herself. The morning is {{delightful}} after the storm, and the air will do her good." ...|$|R
60|$|She was comforted {{long before}} I left her. But as <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> out <b>into</b> the street again a man accosted me. Evidently {{he had been}} on the watch, {{awaiting}} me. He fell <b>into</b> <b>step</b> beside me almost before I realized his presence. It was Escovedo.|$|R
