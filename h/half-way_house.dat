5|$|The column {{had yet to}} {{run into}} any American troops when they reached Howard's Tavern (also known as Howard's <b>Half-Way</b> <b>House),</b> {{just a few hundred}} yards from the Jamaica Pass. Tavern keeper William Howard and his son William Jr. were forced to act as guides to show the British the way to the Rockaway Foot Path, an old Indian trail that skirted the Jamaica Pass to the west (located today in the Cemetery of the Evergreens). Five minutes after leaving the tavern, the five American militia {{officers}} stationed at the pass were captured without a shot fired, as they thought that the British were Americans. Clinton interrogated the men and they informed him that they were the only troops guarding the pass. By dawn, the British were through the pass and stopped so that the troops could rest. At 09:00, they fired two heavy cannons to signal the Hessian troops below Battle Pass to begin their frontal assault against Sullivan's men deployed on the two hills flanking the pass, while Clinton's troops simultaneously flanked the American positions from the east.|$|E

Kent Hughes was also impressed by Sir Oswald Mosley's proposal for a British parliament consisting of business and national interests and headed by a powerful executive government. In 1933 he published {{a series of articles}} in the Melbourne Herald, titled [...] "Why I Have Become a Fascist." [...] In one article he wrote that fascism [...] "endeavours to avoid the egotistical attitude of laissez faire and the inertia of socialism."

40|$|The {{focus of}} this diploma thesis is to {{describe}} the position of ex-prisoners on the labour market and how their operations on that market influence the society. In this paper, I will be looking into the social and state budget costs that these people cause, and why we can consider them as another vulnerable group on the labour market. The factors that lower their chances to succeed are lower productivity, level of education, and also statistical discrimination by employers that leads to demanding expectations on possessing a clean record. I will also focus my attention to the solutions that are currently {{in place in the}} Czech Republic, as success on the labour market is an important element to lowering the relapse rate. In the Czech Republic, the relapse rate is between 60 to 65 percent, which is lot higher than in other countries that have been trying to solve this problem {{for a longer period of}} time. This thesis confirms the hypothesis that this problem in the Czech Republic is not being treated on the same level as in other countries, and therefore we could learn and apply other solutions from abroad. <b>Half-way</b> <b>houses</b> have proven to be an effective solution and it would be good to put them into practice in Czech Republic as well...|$|R
