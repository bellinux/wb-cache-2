When braking with the regenerative brake, the energy can be fed {{back to the}} overhead wires. The trams are <b>dimensioned</b> to operate an entire day with the dynamic brakes disconnected from one bogie, and for one hour if disconnected from two bogies, in which case only disc brakes will be used.|$|E
5|$|To {{replace the}} aging Class C trains, from 1985 to 1987, ten T4s were {{converted}} to T1300. They were equipped with a pantograph, received a new front and the doors were moved. Six additional T4s were converted in 1989, and given the designation T8. These only had the pantographs equipped and kept the same front and door arrangement. With {{the introduction of the}} T1300, the western lines could remove the conductor and have single-manned trains with the motorman selling tickets. The T1300-units have had better regularity than the older models they replaced. However, because they are designed for a closed system with automatic train protection, the braking systems are not sufficiently <b>dimensioned</b> for when the drivers use line of sight to regulate the speed and distances between trains. The 1300 units were numbered 1301–1349. After the conversions, Oslo Sporveier operated 49 T1300-cars and 146 T1000-cars. The trains were originally painted red with a beige cheatline.|$|E
5|$|World War I {{proved to}} be a boom for the Meråker Line. The line {{suddenly}} became a transit corridor for shipments from Russia, as well as from Sweden, to the ports in Trondheim and Hommelvik. To cope with the increased traffic, NSB had to both rent equipment from Sweden and acquire ten new Class 21 and Class 35 locomotives between 1913 and 1918. Four of these were transferred from other lines, while six were new. With the new locomotives, the <b>dimensioned</b> axle weight needed to be upgraded to , which mostly involved improving the bridges. The bridge at Funna was dismounted and sold to be used on the Gråkallen Line of the Trondheim Tramway. Class 35 was used on the Gudå–Storlien section, and replaced the aging Class 14. They remained in service until 1929, when they were transferred to the Ofoten Line.|$|E

25|$|For {{reasons of}} space, many devices, {{especially}} in DIN rail format, use flying leads rather than screw terminals, {{especially for the}} neutral input and FE connections.

5000|$|In mathematics, {{effective}} <b>dimension</b> is {{a modification}} of Hausdorff <b>dimension</b> and other fractal <b>dimensions</b> which places it in a computability theory setting. There are several variations (various notions of effective <b>dimension)</b> of which the most common is effective Hausdorff <b>dimension.</b> <b>Dimension,</b> in mathematics, is a particular way of describing {{the size of an}} object (contrasting with measure and other, different, notions of size). Hausdorff <b>dimension</b> generalizes the well-known integer <b>dimensions</b> assigned to points, lines, planes, etc. by allowing one to distinguish between objects of intermediate size between these integer-dimensional objects. For example, fractal subsets of the plane may have intermediate <b>dimension</b> between 1 and 2, as they are [...] "larger" [...] than lines or curves, and yet [...] "smaller" [...] than filled circles or rectangles. Effective <b>dimension</b> modifies Hausdorff <b>dimension</b> by requiring that objects with small effective <b>dimension</b> be not only small but also locatable (or partially locatable) in a computable sense. As such, objects with large Hausdorff <b>dimension</b> also have large effective <b>dimension,</b> and objects with small effective <b>dimension</b> have small Hausdorff <b>dimension,</b> but an object can have small Hausdorff but large effective <b>dimension.</b> An example is an algorithmically random point on a line, which has Hausdorff <b>dimension</b> 0 (since it is a point) but effective <b>dimension</b> 1 (because, roughly speaking, it can't be effectively localized any better than a small interval, which has Hausdorff <b>dimension</b> 1).|$|R

The hydrodynamic couplings that allow over 100% slipping between {{input and output shafts}} are used in difficult ice conditions to increase propeller torque and protect the main engines from large torque variations resulting from propeller blades hitting the ice. The gearbox itself is also designed to withstand the high thrust and torque loads caused by an open propeller operating in ice — the gear teeth are <b>dimensioned</b> to withstand loads up to five times the nominal value.

25|$|The {{measured}} {{capacity of}} refrigeration is always <b>dimensioned</b> in units of power. Domestic and commercial refrigerators may be rated in kJ/s, or Btu/h of cooling. For {{commercial and industrial}} refrigeration systems, {{most of the world}} uses the kilowatt (kW) as the basic unit of refrigeration. Typically, commercial and industrial refrigeration systems in North America are rated in tons of refrigeration (TR). Historically, one TR was defined as the energy removal rate that will freeze one short ton of water at 0°C (32°F) in one day. This was very important because many early refrigeration systems were in ice houses. The simple unit allowed owners of these early refrigeration systems to measure a day's output of ice against energy consumption, and to compare their plant to one down the street. While ice houses make up a much smaller part of the refrigeration industry than they once did, the unit TR has remained in North America. The unit's value as historically defined was approximately 11,958 Btu/hr (3.505kW), and has now been conventionally redefined as exactly 12,000 Btu/hr (3.517kW).|$|E

Wheels, however, (the Land Rover had one on the bonnet {{as well as one}} underneath) were somewhat flatter and wider than those of Matchbox and their circumference was not ribbed at the beginning but this feature was added later. The baseplate, however, was pressed steel with etched lettering (not diecast with moulded lettering {{as was the case with}} Matchbox, Budgie Toys or Lone Star vehicles). Finally, the Land Rover had a trailer hook behind which was a cut, curved extension of the baseplate. The front and rear axles were held to the vehicle differently. The front was covered by the tube of the baseplate and held pinched on each side by extensions of the diecast body. The rear axle was exposed and run through holes in rounded sections folded over on each side of the plate.
