40|$|Background: Left {{ventricular}} <b>end</b> diastolic <b>pressure</b> {{could be}} estimated collectively using various measures of mitral valve and pulmonary venous flow velocities. In patients with aortic regurgitation, the AR velocity reflects the diastolic pressure {{difference between the}} aorta and the left ventricle. We sought to predict the left ventricular <b>end</b> diastolic <b>pressure</b> by a new Doppler index as aortic regurgitation peak early to late diastolic pressure gradient ratio. Patients and Methods: Fifty three patients with at least moderate aortic regurgitation were enrolled in this study. Physical examination, electrocardiography and echocardiography were performed one day before cardiac catheterization. The severity of AR was graded according to the recommendations of American society for echocardiography. The pressure half time, aortic regurgitation early diastolic velocity, aortic regurgitation early diastolic pressure gradient, aortic regurgitation end diastolic velocity, aortic regurgitation <b>end</b> diastolic <b>pressure</b> gradient, and early diastolic to <b>end</b> diastolic <b>pressure</b> gradient ratio of averaged three beats were measured and recorded. The results from cardiac catheterization and echocardiography were compared. Result: The early diastolic to <b>end</b> diastolic <b>pressure</b> gradient ratio was very accurate (80 %) for determining the left ventricular <b>end</b> diastolic <b>pressure</b> (P = 0. 01). An early diastolic to <b>end</b> diastolic <b>pressure</b> gradient ratio of 1. 5 has a sensitivity of 96 % and a specificity of 32 % for left ventricular <b>end</b> diastolic <b>pressure</b> ≤ 12 mmHg. The best cutoff value of early diastolic to <b>end</b> diastolic <b>pressure</b> gradient ratio for the prediction of left ventricular <b>end</b> diastolic <b>pressure</b> > 12 mmHg was higher than 2. 0, with a sensitivity of 71 % and specificity of 96 % We found no significant correlation between the left ventricular <b>end</b> diastolic <b>pressure</b> with either left ventricular ejection fraction or aortic regurgitation severity in cardiac catheterization (P = 0. 5). Conclusion: Doppler echocardiography is a viable alternative of cardiac catheterization for determination of the left ventricular <b>end</b> diastolic <b>pressure.</b> The early diastolic to <b>end</b> diastolic <b>pressure</b> gradient ratio is a simple, easy and new method for assessment of the LVEDP in patients with severe chronic aortic regurgitation...|$|R

5000|$|During this time, King Fisher rarely {{committed}} acts {{of violence}} or theft against other Texan settlers, instead opting to raid and rustle cattle across the Mexican border. This {{was a time of}} massive raids, pillaging, looting, raping, and murder by United States and Mexican bandits. In response to feelings of alleged lack of reprisal or defense by authorities, the Texans formed more groups of bandits. This activity only fueled disputes and ill will from the Mexican side and generating substantial problems for Texas Ranger battalions who were trying to quell Mexican bandit raids into Texas. The Texas Rangers, under Leander H. McNelly, opposed the Mexican rebel leader Juan Cortina. The Rangers also raided the Fisher Ranch and arrested Fisher.

5000|$|If a U-tube {{is filled}} with water and pistons are placed at each <b>end,</b> <b>pressure</b> exerted against the left piston will be {{transmitted}} throughout the liquid and against {{the bottom of the}} right piston. (The pistons are simply [...] "plugs" [...] that can slide freely but snugly inside the tube.) The pressure that the left piston exerts against the water will be exactly equal to the pressure the water exerts against the right piston. Suppose the tube on the right side is made wider and a piston of a larger area is used; for example, the piston on the right has 50 times the area of the piston on the left. If a 1 N load is placed on the left piston, an additional pressure due to the weight of the load is transmitted throughout the liquid and up against the larger piston. The difference between force and pressure is important: the additional pressure is exerted against the entire area of the larger piston. Since there is 50 times the area, 50 times as much force is exerted on the larger piston. Thus, the larger piston will support a 50 N load - fifty times the load on the smaller piston.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To assess {{oesophageal}} Doppler ultrasonography as {{a convenient}} means of optimising positive <b>end</b> expiratory <b>pressure</b> for maximal delivery of oxygen to tissues. DESIGN [...] Measurements of blood flow, arterial oxygen saturation, and cardiac output by thermodilution (when available) at baseline and at 20 - 30 minutes after each incremental increase (2. 5 - 5. 0 cm H 2 O) in positive and expiratory pressure {{to a maximum}} of 20. 0 cm H 2 O. If the cardiac output fell by more than 15 % measurements were repeated after stepwise decreases in positive <b>end</b> expiratory <b>pressure.</b> No other manoeuvre such as endotracheal suction or changing ventilator settings, drug or fluid dosage, or the patient's position was performed for at least one hour {{before the start of the}} study or during it. SETTING [...] Intensive care unit. PARTICIPANTS [...] 10 Patients being mechanically ventilated for acute respiratory failure who had stable haemodynamic and blood gas values and required a fractional inspired oxygen concentration of greater than or equal to 0. 45. They were assessed on a total of 11 occasions. INTERVENTIONS [...] Incremental increases in positive <b>end</b> expiratory <b>pressure</b> followed when indicated by stepwise decreases. END POINT [...] The positive <b>end</b> expiratory <b>pressure</b> providing maximal delivery of oxygen to tissues. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS [...] Arterial oxygen saturation increased with positive <b>end</b> expiratory <b>pressure</b> in all patients by an average of 6. 1 %. In nine of the 11 studies, however, cardiac output fell by 15 % to 30 % after the second increment. On the two other occasions cardiac output and oxygen delivery rose by up to 54 %. Positive <b>end</b> expiratory <b>pressure</b> was decreased on seven occasions; there was considerable individual variation in the time taken for cardiac output to rise and arterial oxygen saturation to fall. In six patients good agreement was seen between the results from Doppler ultrasonography and thermodilution, the mean of the differences being - 0. 3 % with narrow limits of agreement (- 14. 4 % to 13. 9 %). CONCLUSIONS [...] Oesophageal Doppler ultrasonography is a rapid, safe, and reliable technique for optimising positive <b>end</b> expiratory <b>pressure</b> to obtain maximal delivery of oxygen to tissues.
