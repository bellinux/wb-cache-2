25|$|I {{have further}} shown cause for the belief that direct selection, after the fashion of the {{horticulturist}} and the breeder, neither has played, nor can play, any important part {{in the evolution of}} society; apart from other reasons, because I do not see how such selection could be practiced without a serious weakening, it may be the destruction, of the bonds which hold society together. It strikes me that men who are accustomed to contemplate the active or passive extirpation of the weak, the unfortunate, and the superfluous; who justify that conduct on the ground that it has the sanction of the cosmic process, and is the only way of ensuring the progress of the race; who, if they are consistent, must rank medicine among the black arts and count the physician a mischievous preserver of the unfit; on whose matrimonial undertakings the principles of the stud have the chief influence; whose whole lives, therefore, are an education in the noble art of suppressing natural affection and sympathy, are not likely to have any large stock of these commodities left. But, without them, there is no conscience, nor any restraint on the conduct of men, except the calculation of self-interest, the balancing of certain present gratifications against doubtful future pains; and experience tells us how much that is worth. <b>Every</b> <b>day,</b> <b>we</b> see firm believers in the hell of the theologians commit acts by which, as they believe when cool, they risk eternal punishment; while they hold back from those which are opposed to the sympathies of their associates.|$|E

[...] Police Commissioner Gerold Dompig, who headed the investigation from mid-2005 until 2006, stated that the Mountain Brook students engaged in [...] "wild partying, a lot of drinking, lots of room switching every night. We know the Holiday Inn told them they weren't welcome next year.

And, ah, history has proved that wrong." [...] Yet according to Stewart, both he and Gouldman had approached the album positively. [...] "We wrote in a three-month period, 22 songs. <b>Every</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> were coming up with new ideas, and they were getting better and better, as far as we were concerned.

2500|$|On 30 October 2009, May wrote a fanclub {{letter on}} his website stating that Queen had no {{intentions}} to tour in 2010 {{but that there}} was a possibility of a performance. He was quoted as saying, [...] "The greatest debate, though, is always about when we will next play together as Queen. At the moment, in spite of the many rumours that are out there, we do not have plans to tour in 2010. The good news, though, is that Roger and I have a much closer mutual understanding these days—privately and professionally ... and all ideas are carefully considered. Music is never far away from us. As I write, there is an important one-off performance on offer, in the USA, and it remains to be decided whether we will take up this particular challenge. Every day, doors seem to open, and <b>every</b> <b>day,</b> <b>we</b> interact, perhaps more than ever before, with the world outside.

2500|$|Before the 2001 season, Maryland hired a {{new head}} coach, Ralph Friedgen, who {{engineered}} a first-year turnaround for the program. During summer training camp, Gary took an awkward hit and suffered a cervical spine injury. He was evacuated to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore, but fully recovered. Against sixth-ranked Georgia Tech, Gary made a critical 18-yard reception to the Yellow Jackets' 46-yard line with 40seconds left {{as part of}} a drive to push within field goal range. Nick Novak later kicked the tying field goal, and in overtime, kicked the game-winner. The win improved the Terps' record to 6–0 and secured bowl eligibility for Maryland {{for the first time since}} 1991. Against Virginia, Gary recorded five receptions for 99 yards and a 53-yard touchdown. In the penultimate regular season game, 13th-ranked Maryland played Clemson at Byrd Stadium. Gary recorded five receptions for 93yards and a touchdown, and the Terrapins won, 37–20, to ensure at least a share of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) championship with Florida State. The following week, Maryland played its last conference game against NC State. In the final minutes of regulation, with Maryland trailing, quarterback Shaun Hill mounted a 61-yard drive. It culminated with an eight-yard pass to Gary in the corner of the end zone to win the game, 23–19, with 41seconds remaining. The win secured the outright ACC championship. Throughout the season, Gary was quarterback Shaun Hill's preferred receiver, and led the balanced Maryland receiving corps. Gary recorded 49receptions, 727yards, and six touchdowns. He was the first Maryland player since Gary Collins in 1961 to lead the team in receptions in three consecutive seasons. Gary was named an All-ACC player, which made him the first Maryland receiver honored as such since 1995. About that championship-winning season, Gary said in 2009:"Every day, we were told we were nothing. <b>Every</b> <b>day,</b> <b>we</b> were told we were picked to finish seventh in the conference for a reason. Really, we don't have a lot of fond football memories. My [...] has a thick coat of dust on it." ...|$|E
