5|$|Immersion of {{the human}} body in water affects the circulation, renal system, fluid balance, and breathing, because the {{external}} <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> of the water provides support against the internal <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> of the blood. This causes a blood shift from the extravascular tissues of the limbs into the chest cavity, and fluid losses known as immersion diuresis compensate for the blood shift in hydrated subjects soon after immersion. <b>Hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> on the body from head-out immersion causes negative pressure breathing which contributes to the blood shift.|$|E
5|$|Barotrauma, {{an example}} of dysbarism, is {{physical}} damage to body tissues caused by a difference in pressure between a gas space inside, or {{in contact with the}} body, and the surrounding gas or fluid. It typically occurs when the organism is exposed to a large change in ambient pressure, such as when a diver ascends or descends. When diving, the pressure differences which cause the barotrauma are changes in <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
5|$|Low oxygen levels lead to hypoxic {{pulmonary}} vasoconstriction, the {{tightening of}} small {{blood vessels in}} the lung to create an optimal distribution of blood through the lung. Persistently low oxygen levels causing chronic vasoconstriction leads to increased pressure on the pulmonary artery (pulmonary hypertension), which in turn puts strain on the right ventricle, the part of the heart that pumps blood to the lungs. The right ventricle undergoes remodeling, becomes distended and is less able to remove blood from the veins. When this is the case, raised <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> leads to accumulation of fluid in the skin (edema), and in more severe cases the liver and the abdominal cavity.|$|E

50|$|Whale falls {{are able}} {{to occur in the}} deep open ocean due to cold {{temperatures}} and high <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressures.</b> In the coastal ocean, a higher incidence of predators as well as warmer waters hasten the decomposition of whale carcasses. Carcasses may also float due to decompositional gases, keeping the carcass at the surface. In the deep-sea, cold temperatures slow decomposition rates, and high <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressures</b> increase gas solubility, allowing food falls to remain intact and sink to great depths.|$|R
30|$|For dynamic {{equilibrium}} during drilling, it {{is necessary}} to equalize (balance) the <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressures</b> with those predicted abnormal pore pressures and gradients, to avoid any drilling problem. The abnormal pore pressures at these two zones can now be considered as <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressures</b> {{that can be used for}} the calculation of the compensated mud weights as follows: mud weight (ppg) = hydrostatic pressure (psi)/ 0.052  × h (ft). The required heavier mud weight to drill is 11.98  ppg for Abu Roash and 13.8  ppg for Bahariya Formation.|$|R
5|$|Other {{problems}} arise when {{the concentration of}} metabolically active gases is increased. These range from the toxic effects of oxygen at high partial pressure, through buildup of carbon dioxide due to excessive work of breathing, increased dead space, or inefficient removal, to the exacerbation of the toxic effects of contaminants in the breathing gas due to the increased concentration at high pressures. <b>Hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> differences between {{the interior of the}} lung and the breathing gas delivery, increased breathing gas density due to ambient pressure, and increased flow resistance due to higher breathing rates may all cause increased work of breathing and fatigue of the respiratory muscles.|$|E
5|$|The blood shift causes an {{increased}} respiratory and cardiac workload. Stroke volume is not greatly affected by immersion or variation in ambient pressure, but slowed heartbeat reduces the overall cardiac output, particularly {{because of the}} diving reflex in breath-hold diving. Lung volume decreases in the upright position, owing to cranial displacement of the abdomen from <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure,</b> and {{resistance to air flow}} in the airways increases because of the decrease in lung volume. There appears to be a connection between pulmonary edema and increased pulmonary blood flow and pressure, which results in capillary engorgement. This may occur during higher intensity exercise while immersed or submerged.|$|E
5|$|Like other insects, {{grasshoppers}} {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} and their body cavities are filled with haemolymph. A heart-like structure in {{the upper part of}} the abdomen pumps the fluid to the head from where it percolates past the tissues and organs on its way back to the abdomen. This system circulates nutrients throughout the body and carries metabolic wastes to be excreted into the gut. Other functions of the haemolymph include wound healing, heat transfer and the provision of <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure,</b> but the circulatory system is not involved in gaseous exchange. Respiration is performed using tracheae, air-filled tubes, which open at the surfaces of the thorax and abdomen through pairs of valved spiracles. Larger insects may need to actively ventilate their bodies by opening some spiracles while others remain closed, using abdominal muscles to expand and contract the body and pump air through the system.|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a technique for cultivation of chemolithoautotrophs under high <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressures</b> that is successfully applicable to various types of deep-sea chemolithoautotrophs, including methanogens. It {{is based on a}} glass-syringe-sealing liquid medium and gas mixture used in conjunction with a butyl rubber piston and a metallic needle stuck into butyl rubber. By using this technique, growth, survival, and methane production of a newly isolated, hyperthermophilic methanogen Methanopyrus kandleri strain 116 are characterized under high temperatures and <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressures.</b> Elevated <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressures</b> extend the temperature maximum for possible cell proliferation from 116 °C at 0. 4 MPa to 122 °C at 20 MPa, providing the potential for growth even at 122 °C under an in situ high pressure. In addition, piezophilic growth significantly affected stable carbon isotope fractionation of methanogenesis from CO 2. Under conventional growth conditions, the isotope fractionation of methanogenesis by M. kandleri strain 116 was similar to values (− 34 ‰ to− 27 ‰) previously reported for other hydrogenotrophic methanogens. However, under high <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressures,</b> the isotope fractionation effect became much smaller (<− 12 ‰), and the kinetic isotope effect at 122 °C and 40 MPa was − 9. 4 ‰, {{which is one of the}} smallest effects ever reported. This observation will shed light on the sources and production mechanisms of deep-sea methane...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of laser pulse duration on the spectral emissions observed from bulk ionic solutions {{has been investigated}} for <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressures</b> between 0. 1 and 30 MPa. Transient pressure, shadowgraph imaging and spectroscopic measurements were performed for single pulses of duration 20 and 150 ns. The transient pressure measurements show that for <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressures</b> up to 30 MPa, propagation of the high-pressure shockwave generated by the focused laser causes the local pressure to reduce below ambient levels during the time frame that spectroscopic measurements can be made. The pressure impulse and subsequent reduction in pressure are larger, with the latter lasting longer for the 150 ns pulse compared to a 20 ns pulse of the same energy. The 150 ns pulse generates larger cavities with significant enhancement of the spectral emissions observed compared to the 20 ns duration pulse for pressures up to 30 MPa. The results demonstrate that laser-induced breakdown using a long ns duration pulse offers an advantage over conventional, short ns duration pulses {{for the analysis of}} bulk ionic solutions at <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressures</b> between 0. 1 and 30 MPa...|$|R

40|$|A new {{experimental}} apparatus {{has been}} developed for performing shear tests on specimens held under moderately high <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressures</b> (on the order of 4 GPa).

30|$|Knowledge of pore {{pressure}} {{is very important}} in deciding the drilling mud weight to be used. Drilling mud in the borehole creates hydrostatic head to balance the formation pressure during drilling. For dynamic equilibrium during drilling, it is necessary to equalize (balance) the <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressures</b> with those predicted abnormal {{pore pressure}}s and gradients, to avoid drilling problems. The abnormal pore pressures at these two zones can now be considered as <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressures</b> {{that can be used for}} the calculation of the compensated equivalent mud weights.

25|$|These {{effects are}} mostly {{consequences}} of immersion in water, the <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> of depth {{and the effects}} of the pressure on breathing gases.

30|$|The {{contraction}} (systole) {{and relaxation}} (diastole) of the chambers {{of the heart}} are coordinated with each beat in a sequence of events that constitute the cardiac cycle (Guyton & Hall 2006). The stresses which the intracellular and extracellular spaces undergo vary {{over the course of}} the cardiac cycle. For example, the active tension is less in magnitude in cardiac tissue during the diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle than it is during the systolic phase. Therefore, the stresses, strains, active tension, and <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressures</b> are all functions of time. Chadwick (Chadwick 1982; Chadwick 1981) suggests a priori that the tissue is in quasi-static equilibrium at each instant of time. The validity of this assumption is supported by two observations. First, the elastic moduli are large in magnitude and displacement waves travel at relatively high speeds in media with large elastic moduli (Latimer et al. 2003; Lowrie 2007). Second, post hoc results predicated on the assumption of quasi-static equilibrium predict that displacements and <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressures</b> are very small in magnitude; perturbations of these quantities {{over the course of the}} cardiac cycle are even smaller. Small changes in displacements and <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressures</b> will, therefore, occur at a very rapid rate, essentially achieving quasi-static equilibrium.|$|R
50|$|It {{is often}} helpful to {{visualize}} the well as a U-tube as in Figure beside. Column Y of the tube represents the annulus and column X represents the pipe (string) in the well. The bottom of the U-tube represents {{the bottom of the}} well. In most cases, there are fluids creating <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressures</b> in both the pipe and annulus. Atmospheric pressure can be omitted, since it works the same on both columns. If the fluid in both the pipe and annulus are of the same density, <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressures</b> would be equal and the fluid would be static {{on both sides of the}} tube. If the fluid in the annulus is heavier, it will exert more pressure downward and will flow into the string, displacing some of the lighter fluid out of the string causing a flow at surface. The fluid level will fall in the annulus, equalizing pressures. When there is a difference in the <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressures,</b> the fluid will try to reach balance point. This is called U-tubing, and it explains why there is often flow from the pipe when making connections. This is often evident when drilling fast because the effective density in the annulus is increased by cuttings.|$|R
