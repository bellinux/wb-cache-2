The output intensities are modulated using Mach-Zehnder modulators {{to create the}} write, read and <b>data</b> <b>pulses.</b> The modulators are driven by two independent outputs of a pulse-pattern generator. We cascade three Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers to increase the peak power of the write and read pulses.

In this paper, we show theoretically how such a WLC {{can be used to}} realize a distortion-free delay system for a <b>data</b> <b>pulse.</b> The system consists of two WLCs placed in series.

40|$|The {{spectral}} occupancy {{and composition}} of a chosen digital signaling technique when the <b>data</b> <b>pulse</b> stream is nonideal, due for instance to implementation imper-fections, are important considerations {{in the design of}} a practical communication system. One source of imperfection is timing jitter where the rising and falling transitions do not occur at the nominal data transition time instants; nevertheless, the time instants are ofiset by random amounts relative to the nominal one. The amount of timing shift per transmission interval is random and typically is charac-terized by a discrete random process (independent of the data sequence) with known statistical properties. The {{purpose of this article is}} to characterize the power spec-tral density (PSD) of baseband signaling schemes in the presence of arbitrary timing jitter. Although general PSD results are flrst obtained for arbitrary timing jitter statistics, speciflc results are then given for the cases of practical interest, namely, uniform and Gaussian distributed jitter. Examples of an uncorrelated <b>data</b> <b>pulse</b> stream, an independent identically distributed data stream, and Markov sources are given. Interesting results emerge when the generating sequence fang is uncor-related. For generating sequences fang that are nonzero mean, timing jitter has the efiect of widening the main lobe of the spectrum and increasing the side lobes. When the generating sequence is zero mean and uncorrelated, a rather surprising result is that the timing jitter does not afiect the PSD. Simulation results are also presented to verify the analysis.
