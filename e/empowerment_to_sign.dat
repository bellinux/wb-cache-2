40|$|Background: Professional {{programs}} should prepare and empower students to meet industry expectations and real-world challenges. However, as clinical placement opportunities cannot be completely controlled and standardised, student preparedness {{to succeed in}} graduate roles is difficult to assess. Although real-world settings may not align with the curriculum, it remains an important and challenging academic activity to examine students’ capability to succeed. A step towards such assessment is taken by examining students’ beliefs and feelings of <b>empowerment</b> <b>to</b> meet industry standards for care delivery. The research and/or issue under consideration: This project assessed the viability of an impact evaluation method {{to determine whether the}} BNSc curriculum empowered students to meet industry expectations. Any lack of student belief in their <b>empowerment</b> <b>to</b> successfully deliver care in these settings may reveal gaps between curriculum and industry requirements. Method: An impact evaluatio method was deployed and provides findings from which a judgement of program worth can be concluded 1. Evidence was assembled using qualitative interviews, workshops and document content analysis to examine the curriculum/industry experiences. University ethics approval was obtained and the palliative care setting was chosen as it requires complex care and is supported by documented graduate capabilities 2. Results and implications: Industry expectations of nursing graduate capabilities were assessed against students’ own beliefs and feelings of <b>empowerment</b> <b>to</b> achieve that standard. Students did not feel fully empowered to meet all of the documented palliative care graduate capabilities, revealing gaps between curriculum and industry expectations. <b>Empowerment</b> is critical <b>to</b> evaluate as it directly impacts students' reflections on the value of the program of study undertaken...|$|R
