500|$|Corman {{has noted}} that making the film was a pleasurable experience: [...] "I enjoyed The Pit and the Pendulum because <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>got</b> the chance to {{experiment}} a bit with {{the movement of the}} camera. [...] There was a lot of moving camera work and interesting cutting in the climax of the film." ...|$|E
500|$|In a retrospective, Paul Mallinson of Computer & Video Games (CVG) {{wrote that}} the game's {{production}} was [...] "speedy, focused and fun". Castle said that, because the company was creating other titles at the time, development of Command & Conquer was not a [...] "working party"; but lead programmer Joe Bostic later {{said that it was}} [...] "so much fun that I would sometimes marvel that <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>got</b> paid as well." [...] The game's playtesters were enthusiastic about the game during development, which Castle later said had encouraged the team to work harder. The team created live-action FMV cutscenes for the game. These cutscenes contain no professional actors aside from Kucan, who played Kane and was heavily involved in their production. The cast is made up of Westwood team members, and a low budget meant that filming took place in [...] "spare rooms" [...] and warehouses. Castle later said that the team [...] "had no illusions that we were as good as TV or film," [...] but that the cutscenes were not intentionally campy. He credited Kucan with [...] "taking ragtag group of people who had no business {{in front of a camera}} and making something reasonably good." [...] To replace the spice from Dune II, the team introduced Tiberium, which was inspired by the 1957 B-movie The Monolith Monsters. Castle said that the team's goal in both cases was to create [...] "a central resource that everybody was fighting over." [...] As with Dune II, the soundtrack was composed by Frank Klepacki.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Tik Tok" [...] was {{directed}} by Syndrome. It was shot in Kesha's old neighborhood and the car featured in the video belongs to her. Kesha explained the experience saying, [...] "the video I'm excited about because <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>got</b> to shoot it in my old neighborhood and the guy driving my gold car {{is a friend of}} mine". The video's party scene was shot in her friend's house, which they refer to as the [...] "drunk tank". The singer said [...] "the last party scene is in this house called the drunk tank, which is one of my friend's houses that we all go party at. So I like it cause its super-honest and genuine." [...] The video begins with Kesha waking in a bathtub in a home as she stumbles out and begins to look for a toothbrush in the restroom. She makes her way down a staircase looking at the pictures lining the wall. Kesha makes her way to the kitchen and walks in on a family who are having breakfast, startling them. She shrugs and then leaves the home as the family gets up and follows her. When she arrives at the sidewalk, she picks up a gold bicycle lying against a fallen fence and rides off. Kesha meets a group of children and trades the bicycle for their boombox. The video cuts to another scene where she rejects a guy and is picked up by a man portrayed by Simon Rex who drives her in a gold 1978 Trans Am. They are pulled over by the police, who handcuff Kesha. The scene then pans to her singing while standing in the T-top as she dangles the handcuffs hanging from her left arm. The next scene shows Kesha in an empty room filled with glitter. She then attends a party with Rex for the final scene. The video comes to an end with Kesha lying in a different bathtub from the one she woke up in. The official music video has received over 360 million views on YouTube as of July 2017.|$|E

2500|$|Rock's {{subject matter}} {{typically}} involves family, politics, romance, music, class relationships, and {{race relations in}} the United States. Though not strictly autobiographical, much of his comic standpoint seem rooted in his teenage experience; his strict parents, concerned about the inadequacies of the local school system, arranged to have the adolescent Rock bused to a nearly all-white high school in Bensonhurst (an Italian-ethnic neighborhood of Brooklyn known at the time for poor race relations). In his memoir Rock This, the comedian recalls, [...] "My parents assumed I'd get a better education in a better neighborhood.

5000|$|The {{recordings}} {{also make}} reference to a disagreement between the council and Bashir over Boro Taxis' trade. In dealing with this dispute, Mallon failed to declare his personal friendship with Bashir, as he was required to. In the recordings, Mallon claims to have 'played a fucking blinder' {{and goes on to}} say: [...] "Well I’m the boss here but remember this, I'm prevented from doing my job because of my conflict of interest with you... because <b>I</b> have <b>actually</b> <b>got</b> away with murder because I've declared my friendship with you in that meeting and still been able to do what I want to do." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Breathe" [...] was {{originally}} recorded for the Bittersweet album without Sean Paul, but his vocals were added {{for the single}} release. The song uses a slightly altered instrumental of Dr. Dre's 1999 song [...] "What's the Difference" [...] featuring Eminem and Xzibit, which in turn revolved around a sample from Charles Aznavour's 1966 song [...] "Parce Que Tu Crois". In {{an interview with the}} Metro, when asked {{what it was like to}} work with Dre, Cantrell said, [...] "It was a remix, so <b>I</b> never <b>actually</b> <b>got</b> to meet him. They were his beats, but it was actually produced by another girl, Andrea Martin, and Ivan Matias. If I had to choose, I much prefer the remix to the original." ...|$|R

"In the {{weakness}} of the moment (for it was nothing else), I was on the point of matching her petty spitefulness by spitefulness quite as petty on my side. <b>I</b> had <b>actually</b> <b>got</b> as far as the whole length of the street {{on my way to the}} major's cottage, bent on telling him the secret of his daughter's morning walks, before my better sense came back to me. When I did cool down, I turned round at once, and took the way home. No, no, Miss Milroy; mere temporary mischief-making at the cottage, which would only end in your father forgiving you, and in Armadale profiting by his indulgence, will nothing like pay the debt I owe you. I don't forget that your heart is set on Armadale; and that the major, however he may talk, has always ended hitherto in giving you your own way.

60|$|After a time, I {{began to}} think it would never do for me, a Protestant born and baptised, to be {{studying}} a Romish prayer-book; and I hunted up one that was Protestant, and which had been written expressly for seamen. This I took to my room, and used {{in place of the}} Romish book. Dr. Terrill had a number of bibles under his charge, and I obtained one of these, also, and <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>got</b> into the practice of reading a chapter every night, as well as of reading a prayer, also knocked off from drink, and ceased to swear. My reading in the bible, now, was not for the stories, but seriously to improve my mind and morals.|$|E
5000|$|... "I was {{experimenting with}} moving {{intervals}} in my playing, doing seconds and thirds to fourths and fifths. It was creating a different sound instead of typical jazz lines.

Harold started playing the intervals, too, so that we could bounce off each other. <b>Actually,</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> a lot of my ideas from Joe Chambers, who was always trying to change the recipe.

5000|$|Hamlin said {{in victory}} lane that winning the race [...] "feels great. I’ll tell you, our cars were really running well. Wheels {{and the whole}} group just gave me a great car.

5000|$|Some of {{the barrels}} broke {{up in the}} collision, and their {{contents}} caught fire. The engine, tender, guard’s van and the first three passenger carriages were instantly enveloped in dense smoke and flames, which soon spread to the fourth carriage and {{the front of the}} leading post office van. This prevented any immediate attempt to rescue the occupants of the first four carriages, who all died, together with the guard in the front guard’s van and the locomotive's fireman. [...] "We were startled by a collision and a shock. ... I immediately jumped out of the carriage, when a fearful sight met my view. Already the three passenger carriages in front of ours, the vans and the engine were enveloped in dense sheets of flame and smoke, rising fully 20 feet. ... It was the work of an instant. No words can convey the instantaneous nature of the explosion and conflagration. <b>I</b> had <b>actually</b> <b>got</b> out almost before the shock of the collision was over, and this was the spectacle which already presented itself. Not a sound, not a scream, not a struggle to escape, or a movement of any sort was apparent in the doomed carriages. It was as though an electric flash had at once paralysed and stricken every one of their occupants. So complete was the absence of any presence of living or struggling life in them that ... it was imagined that the burning carriages were destitute of passengers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thrice, Mr. John. The {{first time}} was thirty years ago; and I confess I lost him, on that occasion, by want of science; for the art is not learned in a day, and I had then {{followed}} the business but ten years. The second time was five years later: and I had then been fishing expressly for the old gentleman, about a month. For near a minute, {{it was a matter}} of dispute between us, whether he should come out of the lake or I go into it; but <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>got</b> his gills in plain sight. That was a glorious haul! Washington did not feel better the night Cornwallis surrendered, than I felt on that great occasion!" ...|$|E
6000|$|There was no rise now, and {{the lake}} was leaden and gloomy. When I reached {{the edge of the}} deep reeds I tried, once or twice, to wade through them within casting {{distance}} of the water, but was always driven off by the traitorous quagginess of the soil. At last, taking my courage in both hands, <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>got</b> so near that I could throw a fly {{over the top of the}} tall reeds, and then came a heavy splash, and the wretched little broken rod nearly doubled up. [...] "Hooray, here I am among the big ones!" [...] I said, and held on. It was now that I learned the nature of Nero's diversion when he was an angler in the Lake of Darkness. The loch really did deserve the term [...] "grim"; the water here was black, the sky was ashen, the long green reeds closed cold about me, and beyond them there was trout that I could not deal with. For when he tired of running, which was soon, he was as far away as ever. Draw him through the forest of reeds I could not. At last I did the fatal thing. I took hold of the line, and then, [...] "plop," [...] as the poet said. He was off. A young sportsman on the bank who had joined me expressed his artless disappointment. I cast over the confounded reeds once more. [...] "Splash!"--the old story! I stuck to the fish, and got him into the watery wood, and then he went where the lost trout go. No more came on, so I floundered a yard or two farther, and climbed into a wild-fowl's nest, a kind of platform of matted reeds, all yellow and faded. The nest immediately sank down deep into the water, but it stopped somewhere, and I made a cast. The black water boiled, and the trout went straight down and sulked. I merely held on, till at last it seemed [...] "time for us to go," [...] and by cautious tugging I got him through the reedy jungle, and [...] "gruppit him," [...] as the Shepherd would have said. He was simply but decently wrapped round, from snout to tail, in very fine water-weeds, as in a garment. Moreover, he was as black as your hat, quite unlike the comely yellow trout who live on the gravel in Clearburn. It hardly seemed sensible to get drowned in this gruesome kind of angling, so, leaving the Lake of Darkness, we made for Buccleugh, passing the cleugh where the buck was ta'en. Surely it is the deepest, the steepest, and the greenest cleugh that is shone on by the sun! Thereby we met an angler, an ancient man in hodden grey, strolling home from the Rankle burn. And we told him of our bad day, and asked him concerning that hideous fly, which had covered the loch and lured the trout from our decent Greenwells and March browns. And the ancient man listened to our description of the monster, and He said: [...] "Hoot, ay; ye've jest forgathered wi' the Bloody Doctor." ...|$|E
5000|$|You know, {{it was a}} shock. I haven't {{been proud}} to admit to {{everyone}} that I did scream. I didn't expect to be shocked by an earthquake. <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>got</b> so used to them that I don't mind them ... but this one came from nowhere.|$|E
5000|$|Before she {{was sixteen}} years old, Shapiro had been voted Britain's [...] "Top Female Singer".

During the course of the tour, the Beatles had their first hit single and John Lennon and Paul McCartney wrote the song [...] "Misery" [...] for her, but Shapiro did not record the composition. In 1995, during a This is Your Life highlighting her life and career, Shapiro revealed, [...] "It was actually turned down on my behalf before I ever heard it, <b>actually.</b> <b>I</b> never <b>got</b> to hear it or give an opinion. It's a shame, really."
