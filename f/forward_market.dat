5|$|Covered {{interest}} rate parity is a no-arbitrage condition in foreign exchange markets which {{depends on the}} availability of the <b>forward</b> <b>market.</b> It can be rearranged to give the forward exchange rate {{as a function of the}} other variables. The forward exchange rate depends on three known variables: the spot exchange rate, the domestic {{interest rate}}, and the foreign interest rate. This effectively means that the forward rate is the price of a forward contract, which derives its value from the pricing of spot contracts and the addition of information on available interest rates.|$|E
5|$|Other {{rationales}} {{for the failure}} of the forward rate unbiasedness hypothesis include considering the conditional bias to be an exogenous variable explained by a policy aimed at smoothing interest rates and stabilizing exchange rates, or considering that an economy allowing for discrete changes could facilitate excess returns in the <b>forward</b> <b>market.</b> Some researchers have contested empirical failures of the hypothesis and have sought to explain conflicting evidence as resulting from contaminated data and even inappropriate selections of the time length of forward contracts. Economists demonstrated that the forward rate could serve as a useful proxy for future spot exchange rates between currencies with liquidity premia that average out to zero during the onset of floating exchange rate regimes in the 1970s. Research examining the introduction of endogenous breaks to test the structural stability of cointegrated spot and forward exchange rate time series have found some evidence to support forward rate unbiasedness in both the short and long term.|$|E
5|$|The forward {{exchange}} rate is {{the rate at which}} a commercial bank is willing to commit to exchange one currency for another at some specified future date. The {{forward exchange}} rate is a type of forward price. It is the exchange rate negotiated today between a bank and a client upon entering into a forward contract agreeing to buy or sell some amount of foreign currency in the future. Multinational corporations and financial institutions often use the <b>forward</b> <b>market</b> to hedge future payables or receivables denominated in a foreign currency against foreign exchange risk by using a forward contract to lock in a {{forward exchange rate}}. Hedging with forward contracts is typically used for larger transactions, while futures contracts are used for smaller transactions. This is due to the customization afforded to banks by forward contracts traded over-the-counter, versus the standardization of futures contracts which are traded on an exchange. Banks typically quote forward rates for major currencies in maturities of one, three, six, nine, or twelve months, however in some cases quotations for greater maturities are available up to five or ten years.|$|E
40|$|<b>Forward</b> <b>markets,</b> both {{medium term}} and long term, {{complement}} the spot market for wholesale electricity.

In the long term, a <b>forward</b> reliability <b>market</b> assures adequate resources are available when they are needed most.

40|$|We {{test the}} {{strategic}} motive {{to sell forward}} in experimental Cournot duopoly and quadropoly environments with two <b>forward</b> <b>markets.</b> The strategic motive to sell forward is seldom observed for a duopoly as once experienced subjects seldom use <b>forward</b> <b>markets.</b> Production mostly occurs in the spot market phase and output produced is frequently close to the monopoly level for an experienced duopoly. The presence of <b>forward</b> <b>markets</b> helps subjects in coordinating their actions. Output levels are also less than the Cournot Nash equilibrium prediction for a quadropoly. Interestingly, subjects select output levels of zero in both the market structures to signal collusion in the spot phase.

25|$|Skilling {{started his}} career in Houston as an analyst for First City Bancorporation of Texas in Houston. First City was one of Enron's banks and just before it failed the first time, Skilling quit. The CEO of Collecting Bank, the FDIC's {{facility}} for managing the bad assets of First City, was Sam Segnar, the first CEO and chairman of Enron. The new First City Bank, headed by A. Robert Abboud, was also an Enron bank. Abboud was {{the former president of}} First Chicago Bank and Occidental Petroleum under Armand Hammer. First City was initiated by Judge James Andersen Elkins and his law partnership, Vinson & Elkins, one of Enron's main law companies. As a consultant for McKinsey & Company, Skilling worked with Enron during 1987, helping the company create a <b>forward</b> <b>market</b> in natural gas. Skilling impressed Kenneth Lay in his capacity as a consultant, and was hired by Lay during 1990 as {{chairman and chief executive officer}} of Enron Finance Corp. In 1991, he became the chairman of Enron Gas Services Co., which was a result of the merger of Enron Gas Marketing and Enron Finance Corp. Skilling was named CEO and managing director of Enron Capital & Trade Resources, which was the subsidiary responsible for energy trading and marketing. He was promoted to president and chief operating officer of Enron during 1997, second only to Lay, while remaining the manager of Enron Capital & Trade Resources. During 1999, Enron initiated EnronOnline, an Internet-based trading operation, which was used by virtually every energy company in the United States.|$|E

What is certain is that the forward rates reflect the expectations <b>forward</b> <b>market</b> participants have on the changes of the spot rate during the specified interval.

40|$|The {{existence}} of <b>forward</b> <b>markets</b> {{has long been}} explained by risk hedging behaviour.

However, an important facet of many <b>forward</b> <b>markets</b> that has typically been ignored in the literature is the durable nature of output (e. g. nickel and lead). We show that <b>forward</b> <b>markets</b> may optimally emerge as long as a monopolist sells any fraction of its durable output. In particular, the comparative static analysis shows that as the durability of the product increases or the fraction of output sold increases, the monopolist will optimally increase the number of forward contracts purchased due to an exacerbated commitment problem with buyers. Our analysis also provides another explanation for differences between the forward price and the expected future spot price of a commodity that does not rely on uncertainty or risk considerations. <b>Forward</b> <b>Markets,</b> Durable Goods, Monopoly,...|$|R

Defining the fiduciary duties these <b>forwarding</b> <b>market</b> professionals owe their clients when they invest funds with third parties raises complex issues concerning due diligence, postinvestment monitoring of investments, and disclosure of material facts. Weak regulatory standards, advances in technology in the financial-services industry, and changes in the scope of services provided by broker-dealers emphasize both the inadequacies of the system created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (1934) Act and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (IAA) and the urgent need for a new regulatory standard.

Because a triangular parity condition holds among these three currencies, the available <b>forward</b> <b>markets,</b> albeit incomplete, provide a useful avenue for the firm to indirectly hedge against its foreign exchange rate risk exposure. This article offers analytical insights into the optimal cross-hedging strategies of the firm.
