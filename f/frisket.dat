A small rotating handle is used called the 'rounce' to do this, and the impression is made with a screw that transmits pressure through the platen. To turn the screw the long handle attached to it is turned. This is known as the bar or 'Devil's Tail.' In a well-set-up press, the springiness of the paper, <b>frisket,</b> and tympan caused the bar to spring back and raise the platen, the windlass turned again to move the bed back to its original position, the tympan and <b>frisket</b> raised and opened, and the printed sheet removed. Such presses were always worked by hand. After around 1800, iron presses were developed, some of which could be operated by steam power.|$|E

2500|$|A {{printing}} press, in its classical form, is {{a standing}} mechanism, ranging from [...] long, [...] wide, and [...] tall. Type, small metal letters {{that have a}} raised letter on one end, is arranged into pages {{and placed in a}} frame to make a forme, which itself is placed onto a flat stone, 'bed,' or 'coffin.' The text is inked using two balls, pads mounted on handles. The balls were made of dog skin leather, because it has no pores, and stuffed with sheep's wool and were inked. This ink was then applied to the text evenly. One damp piece of paper was then taken from a heap of paper and placed on the tympan. The paper was damp as this lets the type 'bite' into the paper better. Small pins hold the paper in place. The paper is now held between a <b>frisket</b> and tympan (two frames covered with paper or parchment).|$|E
2500|$|The {{technique}} {{allows for}} the blending {{of two or more}} colors in a seamless way, with one color slowly becoming another color. Freehand airbrushed images, without the aid of stencils or <b>friskets,</b> have a floating quality, with softly defined edges between colors, and between foreground and background colors. A skilled airbrush artist can produce paintings of photographic realism or can simulate almost any painting medium. [...] Painting at this skill level involves supplementary tools, such as masks and <b>friskets,</b> and very careful planning.|$|R

2500|$|Oxnead was {{emptied of}} its treasures, sold off {{and all but}} demolished, but in 1809 its {{long-term}} tenant, John Adey Repton, made a conjectural drawing of it, based on the foundations and recollections of local inhabitants, which was illustrated in W.H. Bartlett and John Britten's Architectural Antiquities of Great Britain 1809, following p.98. his view is centered on the terraced parterres, in the lowest of which, he says, stood the fountain of two tiers of bold opposed scrolls supporting a shallow basin, re-erected after the Oxnead sale at the rival Norfolk house, Blickling Hall. Repton's drawing showed the banqueting house constructed as a wing; its style was so advanced for its date in the 1630s that the younger Repton concluded {{that it had been}} [...] "erected by the first Earl of Yarmouth, to receive King Charles II. and his attendants, who visited Oxnead in 1676; it was a lofty building, with sash-windows, called the Banquetting-room. Underneath this was a vaulted apartment, which was called the <b>Frisketting</b> room, probably from the Italian 'frescati', a cool grotto." [...] Repton's drawing shows a building of three bays articulated by a giant order, with large rectangular windows over the basement windows and oval windows, recalled by local people, in a mezzanine above.|$|R

50|$|Watercolouring <b>frisket</b> {{is applied}} using a brush, allowed to dry, {{and then the}} {{watercolour}} paints are applied and also allowed to dry. Once the paper is completely dry, the <b>frisket</b> can be easily removed by gentle rubbing with a natural crepe rubber pickup - {{the same as those}} used for removal of rubber cement. It is important that the paper be completely dry before removing the <b>frisket</b> as the friction can otherwise damage the paper if still damp.|$|E
50|$|On a sheet-fed {{letterpress}} printing machine, a <b>frisket</b> is {{a sheet of}} oiled paper that covers {{the space between the}} type or cuts (illustrations) and the edge of the paper that is to be printed. When the press operator uses a brayer to coat the surface of the type with ink, the ink brayer will often coat the furniture and slugs (wood and metal spacers) between the columns and around the type. To keep this ink from touching the target sheet, the <b>frisket</b> covers the area that is not desired to print. The <b>frisket</b> is set in a frame, often hinged to the tympan that holds the paper in place.|$|E
50|$|A <b>frisket</b> is any {{material}} that protects areas {{of a work}} from unintended change.|$|E
50|$|In airbrushing, a <b>frisket</b> is {{a plastic}} sheet with an {{adhesive}} backing used {{to mask off}} specific areas of an image so that only the exposed area is covered with paint. The <b>frisket</b> is vital to airbrushing, because it allows the artist to control excess paint spray, create special effects, achieve extreme precision, control edge attributes and to expedite the airbrushing process.|$|E

50|$|In Watercolouring, <b>frisket,</b> also {{sometimes}} called masking fluid, is a removable liquid masking fluid based on latex and ammonia, often available in various colours {{to make its}} presence more obvious, which {{is applied to the}} surface in order to mask off the areas that are not to be coloured by a given application of paint. <b>Frisket</b> is usually used when the unmasked areas are desired to be the same colour and a rapid wash is being applied, or for negative painting effects.|$|E

50|$|Most solid masks {{require an}} {{adhesive}} {{to hold the}} mask in place while work is performed. Some, such as masking tape and <b>frisket,</b> come with adhesive pre-applied. Solid masks are readily available in bulk, and are used in large painting jobs.|$|E
50|$|A <b>frisket</b> {{differs from}} other masks {{in that it}} is a single sheet that covers the entire work, parts of which are removed by cutting into the sheet. Friskets are {{available}} in matté and glossy finishes. Some friskets are also solvent-proof, manufactured for use with solvent-reduced and -based Urethanes.|$|E
50|$|A {{subsequent}} application of <b>frisket</b> {{can be applied}} to mask other areas - usually those with the intention of applying a different colour or to darken some areas whilst not affecting others - and removed with the natural rubber pickup. This process can be repeated several times without damaging artist grade watercolour papers, so long as the paper is completely dry after each application of watercolours. Some lesser grades of paper often used for practice and academic purposes, may be more prone to damage after repeated masking and painting cycles however. Note also that whilst watercolour <b>frisket</b> can be removed by rubbing with the fingers, doing so has the disadvantage of potentially transferring skin oils which can discolour the artwork, or otherwise affect {{subsequent application}}s of watercolours or other mediums such as chalk, ink, etc.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes {{the artist}} leaves {{a section of}} the image {{untouched}} while filling in the remainder. The shape of the area to preserve can be painted with masking fluid or cut out of a <b>frisket</b> and applied to the drawing surface, protecting the surface from stray marks until the mask is removed.|$|E

The <b>frisket</b> is the right-most portion of the press, with four openings for the pages to be printed. The middle, with the printed sheet on it, is the tympan, and at left, the bed which holds the type being inked.|$|E
50|$|These are folded down, so {{that the}} paper lies {{on the surface of}} the inked type. The bed is rolled under the platen, using a {{windlass}} mechanism.

A year after his defeat, he co-founded a franchise called Frais et <b>Frisket.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>frisket</b> {{is fixed}} to the {{painting}} surface and then the appropriate shapes are {{cut out of the}} material using a razor or scalpel. The cut piece is lifted, the exposed area painted, and the process repeated using the cut pieces to mask their matching finished areas. When all painting is finished, the resulting work contains precise shapes with no overspray.|$|E
50|$|A stencil {{technique}} is employed in screen printing {{which uses a}} tightly woven mesh screen coated in {{a thin layer of}} emulsion to reproduce the original image. As the stencil is attached to the screen, a contiguous template is not necessary.A stencil used in airbrushing called a <b>frisket</b> is pressed directly on the artwork. It can be used control or contain overspray, create sharp or complex shapes, but is not designed to be used more than once.|$|E

5000|$|With {{water-based}} media such as inks, acrylic paints, tempera paints or watercolor paints, a wet brush {{should be}} dipped {{into a pool}} of very wet and diluted paint. This paint pool should be evenly mixed and dispersed to prevent uneven pigment load on the brush. The loaded brush should then be applied to a dry or wet support. Washes are most often applied with large brushes over large areas. The areas in which a wash effects can be controlled with careful application of the wash, and {{with the use of}} liquid <b>frisket</b> or rubber cement.|$|E

5000|$|Enzo, freshly {{upgraded}} into a Guardian candidate by Bob {{during the}} Web incursion, defends Mainframe from Megabyte and Hexadecimal, with Dot and AndrAIa at his side. When Enzo entered a game {{he could not}} win, he, AndrAIa, and <b>Frisket</b> changed their icons to game sprite mode and rode the game out of Mainframe. The accelerated game time accelerated Enzo and AndrAIa's aging. Subsequent episodes follow adult versions of Enzo and AndrAIa, who {{are now in a}} romantic relationship, as they travel from system to system in search of Mainframe. The older Enzo adopts the name [...] "Matrix" [...] (previously his and Dot's surname), carrying a weapon named [...] "Gun" [...] and Bob's damaged Glitch. The time spent in games and away from Mainframe hardened both Matrix and AndrAIa: Matrix developed a pathological hatred of Megabyte, and grew into a muscular, shoot-first-ask-question-later hero, while AndrAIa turned into a level-headed warrior. As the season progresses, Matrix and AndrAIa are reunited with Bob and the crew of the Saucy Mare and return to Mainframe, which has been almost completely destroyed by Megabyte and his forces. The group reunites with Dot and the resistance, then heads to the Principal Office for a final battle with Megabyte. Megabyte is defeated by Matrix, but not before Megabyte's handiwork causes the system to crash. All final problems in Mainframe were dealt with by The User restarting the system, setting everything right and restoring everything as it was again for the protagonists, with one major exception: younger and older Enzo now exist simultaneously, as Matrix's icon was still set to [...] "Game Sprite" [...] mode. Because of this mishap, he was not recognized properly by the system when it rebooted, so it restored a copy of his younger self.|$|E
