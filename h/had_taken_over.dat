5|$|During its {{brief time}} in operation, the Pony Express {{delivered}} approximately 35,000 letters between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California. Although the Pony Express {{proved that the}} central/northern mail route was viable, Russell, Majors and Waddell {{did not get the}} contract to deliver mail over the route. The contract was instead awarded to Jeremy Dehut in March 1861, who <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> the southern Congressionally favored Butterfield Overland Mail Stage Line. The so-called 'Stagecoach King', Ben Holladay, acquired the Russell, Majors and Waddell stations for his stagecoaches.|$|E
5|$|Eilífr Goðrúnarson's Christianity-influenced {{account of}} Urðarbrunnr (section 52 of Skáldskaparmál) {{associates}} the {{well with the}} south and Rome. Theories have been proposed that this description may have some relation to notions of the Jordan River due to phonetic and typological similarities perceived by Eilífr, though {{there may be no}} other causative connection. Eilífr is otherwise known as a pagan skald, and this selection has been theorized as describing that, due to directly associating Christ with the well, Christ <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> responsibility of providence or fate.|$|E

5|$|Just {{one week}} after the MEF <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> Anbar, insurgents in Fallujah ambushed a convoy {{carrying}} four American mercenaries from Blackwater USA on 31 March, killing all of them. An angry mob then set the mercenaries' bodies ablaze and dragged their corpses through the streets before hanging them over a bridge crossing the Euphrates. The American media compared the attack on the mercenaries to the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu, where images of American soldiers being dragged through the streets of Somalia prompted the United States to withdraw its troops.|$|E

Disney refused, and as Universal owned the rights to Oswald rather than Disney, Mintz set up his own animation studio to produce Oswald cartoons. Most of Disney's staff was hired away by Mintz to move over, once Disney's Oswald contract was done in mid-1928.|$|E

5|$|Outside {{the city}} walls, suburbs had sprung up {{providing}} {{homes for the}} craftsmen and tradespeople who flocked to the already overcrowded city. These were shanty towns with wooden shacks and no sanitation. The government had tried to control this development but had failed and {{over a quarter of}} a million people lived here. Other immigrants <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> fine town houses, vacated by Royalists who had fled the country during the Commonwealth, converting them into tenements with different families in every room. These properties were soon vandalised and became rat-infested slums.|$|E
5|$|The first {{fighting}} between US troops and Yavapai came in early 1837, when the Tolkepaya joined with their Quechan neighbors {{to defend against}} Major Samuel Heintzelman over a Quechan ferry crossing on the Colorado River.

After they killed a group led by John Glanton, who <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> the crossing, the US government retaliated by burning the fields of the Quechans, and {{taking control of the}} crossing.|$|E

5|$|The {{unauthorised}} juvenile {{productions of}} Pinafore were {{so popular that}} Carte mounted his own children's version, played at matinees at the Opera Comique beginning on 16 December 1879. François Cellier, who <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> from his brother as Carte's music director in London, adapted the score for children's voices. Between its two Christmas seasons in London, the children's production went on a provincial tour from 2 August 1880 to 11 December 1880.|$|E
5|$|A {{story was}} told that Ælfric {{introduced}} monks into the cathedral church of Christ Church, Canterbury, replacing the secular clerks that <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> the foundation during the ninth century. Ælfric {{is said to have}} done this on the command of the pope. This story originally dates to soon after the Norman Conquest and originated with the monastic historians of Canterbury, and its veracity is unclear. He likely performed the marriage ceremony of King Æthelred the Unready and Emma of Normandy in 1002. A later tradition held that he consecrated a Bishop of Llandaff and two Bishops of St. David's in Wales, which, if true, would have meant extending Canterbury's jurisdiction into new territory.|$|E
5|$|A third {{building}} {{was constructed in}} 1868 {{at a cost of}} £50,000, within the shell of the old theatre, for Lord Dudley. It was designed by Charles Lee and Sons and their partner, William Pain. They <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> John Nash's practice on his retirement. The new theatre was designed to be less susceptible to fire, with brick firewalls, iron roof trusses and Dennett's patent gypsum-cement floors. The auditorium had four tiers, with a stage large enough for the greatest spectaculars. For opera, the theatre seated 1,890, and for plays, with the orchestra pit removed, 2,500. As a result of a dispute over the rent between Dudley and Mapleson, and a decline in the popularity of ballet, the theatre remained dark until 1874, when it was sold to a Revivalist Christian group for £31,000.|$|E
