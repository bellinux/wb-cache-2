Presidential {{secretary}} John Hay adds to this portrait of devotion by noting in his diary that one night he observed Lamon wrap himself up in his cloak and lie down to sleep in front of Lincoln's bedroom door. [...] Lamon was not in Washington on the night of Lincoln's assassination, being on assignment in Richmond. [...] In his Recollections of Abraham Lincoln Lamon reveals that before he left for Richmond, he implored the president not to [...] "go out at night after [...] was gone, particularly to the theatre." [...] After the assassination, Lamon accompanied the funeral procession to Springfield, Illinois.|$|E
2500|$|After the 1978 playoff game, the Red Sox did {{not reach}} the postseason {{for the next seven}} years. In 1979, Carl Yastrzemski would hit his 3000th career hit and Fred Lynn won the batting crown. The Sox would finish in third with a 91–69 record. Despite plus-.500 {{finishes}} in 1980 and 1981, the Red Sox decided not to resign Fred Lynn, Carlton Fisk, and Rick Burleson. Fisk would <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Sox, Lynn and Burleson went to the California Angels, in two separate trades that brought in Frank Tanana, Joe Rudi, Carney Lansford who would win the 1981 batting title, Rick Miller, and Mark Clear. The Red Sox would win 89 games in 1982 with 14 wins from reliever Mark Clear and a [...]349 batting average from rookie Wade Boggs. Carl Yastrzemski retired after the 1983 season, during which the Red Sox finished sixth in the seven-team AL East, posting their worst record since 1966.|$|E

2500|$|On August 13, 1979, Brock {{became the}} fourteenth player in Major League Baseball history {{to reach the}} 3,000 hits plateau against the team that traded him, the Chicago Cubs. Approximately one month later, Carl Yastrzemski reached the same plateau and was {{promptly}} invited to the White House by Massachusetts Congressman Tip O'Neill. Brock {{was reported to have}} felt slighted that he hadn't received a similar invitation. Brock originally stated that he wouldn't <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House even if he was invited. However, after consideration he decided that forgiveness was the best course and accepted a belated invitation to meet with the President. Brock retired {{at the end of the}} season, having posted a [...]304 batting average in his last season at the age of 40. At the end of the season, he was named the National League Comeback Player of the Year—the first player to be so named in his final Major League season.|$|E

It was a grave little note, a serious little note, like its writer, but it made me laugh.

Many a time he's made General Grant laugh--and that's a tidy job, I can tell you, and as for Sheridan, his eye lights up and he listens to Mulberry Sellers the same as if he was artillery. You see, the charm about Mulberry is, he is so catholic and unprejudiced that he fits in anywhere and everywhere. It makes him powerful good company, and as popular as scandal.
