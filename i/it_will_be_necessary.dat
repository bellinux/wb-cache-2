5|$|The {{blue whale}} is usually {{classified}} {{as one of}} eight species in the genus Balaenoptera; one authority places it in a separate monotypic genus, Sibbaldus, {{but this is not}} accepted elsewhere. DNA sequencing analysis indicates that the blue whale is phylogenetically closer to the sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis) and Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera brydei) than to other Balaenoptera species, and closer to the humpback whale (Megaptera) and the gray whale (Eschrichtius) than to the minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata and Balaenoptera bonaerensis). If further research confirms these relationships, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to reclassify the rorquals.|$|E

5|$|Wartime proved hard on {{the film}} business. On September 23, 1915, Famous Players {{informed}} McKernan that “On account of the boat Hesperian having been torpedoed by a German submarine, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to skip two Weeklies (short films), these having come forward to ourselves from our London representative via this boat. Regretting this occurrence, and trusting you will appreciate our position on this...”. McKernan’s supply of new films was decreased as the war dragged on, and McKernan advertised less and less frequently. Further complicating things, parts for the theatre’s Edison and Simplex projectors were difficult to come by {{at the best of}} times, and the complex machines proved difficult to maintain. McKernan did not live to see business pick up. He contracted Spanish Influenza and pneumonia in rapid succession, and died on February 18, 1919.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} {{biennial}} {{reports from the}} U.S. National Research Council have reviewed the progress of CERP. The fourth report in the series, released in 2012, found that little {{progress has been made}} in restoring the core of the remaining Everglades ecosystem; instead, most project construction so far has occurred along its periphery. The report noted that to reverse ongoing ecosystem declines, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to expedite restoration projects that target the central Everglades, and to improve both the quality and quantity of the water in the ecosystem. To better understand the potential implications of the current slow pace of progress, the report assessed the current status of ten Everglades ecosystem attributes, including phosphorus loads, peat depth, and populations of snail kites, birds of prey that are endangered in South Florida. Most attributes received grades ranging from C (degraded) to D (significantly degraded), but the snail kite received a grade of F (near irreversible damage). The report also assessed the future trajectory of each ecosystem attribute under three restoration scenarios: improved water quality, improved hydrology, and improvements to both water quality and hydrology, which helped highlight the urgency of restoration actions to benefit a wide range of ecosystem attributes and demonstrate the cost of inaction. Overall, the report concluded that substantial near-term progress to address both water quality and hydrology in the central Everglades is needed to reverse ongoing degradation before it is too late.|$|E

25|$|The {{sputtering}} rate {{of tungsten}} by the plasma fuel ions is {{orders of magnitude}} smaller than that of carbon, and tritium is much less incorporated into redeposited tungsten, making this a more attractive choice. On the other hand, tungsten impurities in a plasma are much more damaging than carbon impurities, and self-sputtering of tungsten can be high, so <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> {{to ensure that the}} plasma in contact with the tungsten is not too hot (a few tens of eV rather than hundreds of eV). Tungsten also has disadvantages in terms of eddy currents and melting in off-normal events, as well as some radiological issues.|$|E
25|$|As {{with mild}} acute pancreatitis, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> {{to treat the}} {{underlying}} cause—gallstones, discontinuing medications, cessation of alcohol, etc. If the cause is gallstones, {{it is likely that}} an ERCP procedure or removal of the gallbladder will be recommended. The gallbladder should be removed during the same hospital admission or within two weeks of pancreatitis onset so as to limit the risk of recurrent pancreatitis. If the cause of pancreatitis is alcohol, cessation of alcohol consumption and treatment for alcohol dependency may improve pancreatitis. Even if the underlying cause is not related to alcohol consumption, doctors recommend avoiding it for at least six months as this can cause further damage to the pancreas during the recovery process. Oral intake, especially fats, is generally restricted initially but early enteral feeding within 48 hours has been shown to improve clinical outcomes. Fluids and electrolytes are replaced intravenously. Nutritional support is initiated via tube feeding to surpass the portion of the digestive tract most affected by secreted pancreatic enzymes if there is no improvement in the first 72–96 hours of treatment.|$|E

500|$|American policy {{during the}} Vietnam war was to destroy crops, {{accepting}} the sociopolitical impact {{that that would}} have. The RAND Corporation's Memorandum 5446-ISA/ARPA states: [...] "the fact that the VC [...] obtain most of their food from the neutral rural population dictates the destruction of civilian crops... {{if they are to}} be hampered by the crop destruction program, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to destroy large portions of the rural economy – probably 50% or more". Crops were deliberately sprayed with Agent Orange, areas were bulldozed clear of vegetation, and the rural population was subjected to bombing and artillery fire. In consequence, the urban population in South Vietnam nearly tripled, growing from 2.8 million people in 1958 to 8 million by 1971. The rapid flow of people led to a fast-paced and uncontrolled urbanization; an estimated 1.5 million people were living in Saigon slums due to people moving to cities.|$|E
500|$|Hans-Joachim Bremermann, a {{professor}} of mathematics and biophysics at the University of California at Berkeley, further argued in a 1965 paper that the [...] "speed, memory, and processing capacity of any possible future computer equipment are limited by certain physical barriers: the light barrier, the quantum barrier, and the thermodynamical barrier. These limitations imply, for example, that no computer, however constructed, {{will ever be able}} to examine the entire tree of possible move sequences of the game of chess." [...] Nonetheless, Bremermann did not foreclose the possibility that a computer would someday be able to solve chess. He wrote, [...] "In order to have a computer play a perfect or nearly perfect game [...] <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> either to analyze the game completely ... or to analyze the game in an approximate way and combine this with a limited amount of tree searching. ... A theoretical understanding of such heuristic programming, however, is still very much wanting." ...|$|E
500|$|Part of Special Operations Command (SOCOMD), the 2nd Commando Regiment is one {{of three}} combat-capable units within SOCOMD and {{operates}} in conjunction with other SOCOMD units, services and interagency organisations in joint and combined operations. The role of the regiment is to conduct large scale offensive, support and recovery operations beyond the scope and capability of other Australian Defence Force (ADF) units. Army doctrine specifies that the role of commando units is to [...] "span the gap between conventional infantry operations and unconventional operations", focusing on [...] advance force operations and direct action missions. Formed to complement the Special Air Service Regiment (SASR), according to Blaxland the regiment is designed to be a [...] "self-contained flexible and rapidly deployable force" [...] and is structured for both special operations and domestic counter-terrorism. In its domestic counter-terrorism role it provides the Tactical Assault Group (East) to respond to high-risk incidents on the eastern coast of Australia beyond the capability of state/territory and federal Police Tactical Groups to respond to. The regiment maintains a high readiness element which encompasses the parachute company group role that the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR) had maintained prior to being reroled as a light infantry battalion. In 2010, the then-Chief of Army stated that as part of the future amphibious ready group based on the Navy's new Canberra-class <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to rotate a Commando Company to support the infantry battalion.|$|E

500|$|The LDS Church {{defended the}} {{legitimacy}} of the book by contending that these scholars' methods were faulty. Perhaps most notably, LDS apologists argued that, because many of the Egyptian experts had claimed that the facsimiles were reminiscent of similar documents, or that certain areas on the facsimiles appeared different from known funerary texts, these scholars were merely ignoring potentially key differences in the facsimiles so that their arguments might seem effective. Such a line of reasoning is exemplified by a note written by Church historian B. H. Roberts: [...] "Yes, or some other change might be suggested, and by such a process some other meaning may be read into the place and make it different from the translation of Joseph Smith." [...] The Church eventually hired one Robert C. Webb (the pen name of J. E. Homans), to defend the veracity of the Book of Abraham. In his 1915 work The Case Against Mormonism (in which he claimed to have a PhD, despite this being a deception), he collected several interpretations of Facsimile No. 1 from Egyptologists that sounded unrelated to the layperson (i.e. that the facsimile represented: [...] "an embalming", [...] "the Resurrection of Osiris", or [...] "Anubis guarding the embalmed mummy") and claimed: [...] "If any of these Egyptologists is right, therefore, this drawing must have been radically altered in several essential particulars. In view of their disagreements, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to demonstrate any conclusions drawn. Will some learned person be pleased to tell us what this scene represents?
