500|$|Around this time, a {{group of}} Austral Africa Company prospectors, led by Alfred Haggard, {{approached}} Lobengula's south-western border, hoping to gain their own Matabeleland mining concession; on learning of this, the king honoured one {{of the terms of}} the Rudd Concession by allowing Maguire to go {{at the head of a}} Matabele impi to turn Haggard away. While Robinson's letter to Knutsford made its way to England by sea, the Colonial Secretary learned of the Rudd Concession from Cawston and Gifford. Knutsford wired Robinson on 17 December to ask if there was any truth in what the London syndicate had told him about the agreed transfer of 1,000 Martini–Henrys: [...] "If rifles part of consideration, as reported, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> will be danger of complications arising from this?" [...] Robinson replied, again in writing; he enclosed a minute from Shippard in which the Bechuanaland official explained how the concession had come about, and expressed the view that the Matabele were less experienced with rifles than with assegais, so their receipt of such weapons did not in itself make them lethally dangerous. He then argued that it would not be diplomatic to give Khama and other chiefs firearms while withholding them from Lobengula, and that a suitably armed Matabeleland might act as a deterrent against Boer interference.|$|E

6000|$|... "She honours and obeys, no doubt, you know," [...] said Tackleton; [...] "and that, as I {{am not a}} man of sentiment, {{is quite}} enough for me. But <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there's</b> {{anything}} more in it?" ...|$|R
