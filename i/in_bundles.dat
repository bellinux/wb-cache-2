5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} A.subrubescens are usually solitary, but {{sometimes}} several (typically {{between two and}} eight) are stuck together by the stem bases or {{on the sides of}} their caps. A strictly terrestrial species, it is not found fruiting on wood. It prefers to grow in pine woods, but has occasionally been associated with silver fir in Europe; fruit bodies associated with the latter tree species tend to be less robust than those found growing with pine. It is suspected that A.subrubescens may be mycorrhizal with two- and three-needle pines (i.e., those species that have their needles attached <b>in</b> <b>bundles</b> of two or three), although its ecological preferences are not known with certainty. Ginns, relating a personal communication with David Arora, wrote that Arora encountered several clumps of fruit bodies in an area in California containing mostly knobcone pine (a three-needle pine), manzanita, huckleberry and a few mandrones.|$|E

5|$|Muscle cells (myocytes) {{form the}} active {{contractile}} tissue of the body. Muscle tissue functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs. Muscle is formed of contractile filaments and is separated into three main types; smooth muscle, skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. Smooth muscle has no striations when examined microscopically. It contracts slowly but maintains contractibility {{over a wide}} range of stretch lengths. It is found in such organs as sea anemone tentacles and the body wall of sea cucumbers. Skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension. It is found in the movement of appendages and jaws. Obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two. The filaments are staggered and {{this is the type of}} muscle found in earthworms that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions. In higher animals striated muscles occur <b>in</b> <b>bundles</b> attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets. Smooth muscle is found in the walls of the uterus, bladder, intestines, stomach, oesophagus, respiratory airways, and blood vessels. Cardiac muscle is found only in the heart, allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body.|$|E
40|$|Several {{photochemical}} and spectral {{properties of}} maize (Zea mays) bundle sheath and mesophyll chloroplasts are reported {{that provide a}} better understanding of the photosynthetic apparatus of C 4 plants. The difference absorption spectrum at 298 K and the fluorescence excitation and emission spectra of chlorophyll at 298 K and 77 K provide new information on the different forms of chlorophyll a <b>in</b> <b>bundle</b> sheath and mesophyll chloroplasts: the former contain, relative to short wavelength chlorophyll a forms, more long wavelength chlorophyll a form (e. g. chlorophyll a 693 and chlorophyll a 705) and less chlorophyll b than the latter. The degree of polarization of chlorophyll a fluorescence is 6 % <b>in</b> <b>bundle</b> sheath and 4 % in mesophyll chloroplasts. This result is consistent with the presence of relatively high amounts of oriented long wavelength forms of chlorophyll a <b>in</b> <b>bundle</b> sheath compared to mesophyll chloroplasts. The relative yield of variable, with respect to constant, chorophyll a fluorescence in mesophyll chloroplasts is more than twice that <b>in</b> <b>bundle</b> sheath chloroplast. Furthermore, the relative yield of total chlorophyll a fluorescence is 40 % lower <b>in</b> <b>bundle</b> sheath compared to that in mesophyll chloroplasts. This is in agreement with the presence of the higher ratio of the weakly fluorescent pigment system I to pigment system II <b>in</b> <b>bundle</b> sheath than <b>in</b> mesophyll chloroplast. The efficiency of energy transfer from chlorophyll b and carotenoids to chlorophyll a are calculated to be 100 and 50 %, respectively, in both types of chloroplasts. Fluorescence quenching of atebrin, reflecting high energy state of chloroplasts, is 10 times higher in mesophyll chloroplasts than <b>in</b> <b>bundle</b> sheath chloroplasts during noncyclic electron flow but is equal during cyclic flow. The entire electron transport chain is shown to be present in both types of chloroplasts, as inferred from the antagonistic effect of red (650 nm) and far red (710 nm) lights on the absorbance changes at 559 nm and 553 nm, and the photoreduction of methyl viologen from H 2 O.

5|$|The {{periodontal}} ligament is {{a specialized}} connective tissue that attaches the cementum of a tooth to the alveolar bone. This tissue covers {{the root of}} the tooth within the bone. Each ligament has a width of 0.15–0.38mm, but this size decreases over time. The functions of the periodontal ligaments include attachment of the tooth to the bone, support for the tooth, formation and resorption of bone during tooth movement, sensation, and eruption. The cells of the periodontal ligaments include osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibroblasts, macrophages, cementoblasts, and epithelial cell rests of Malassez. Consisting of mostly Type I and III collagen, the fibers are grouped <b>in</b> <b>bundles</b> and named according to their location. The groups of fibers are named alveolar crest, horizontal, oblique, periapical, and interradicular fibers. The nerve supply generally enters from the bone apical to the tooth and forms a network around the tooth toward the crest of the gingiva. When pressure is exerted on a tooth, such as during chewing or biting, the tooth moves slightly in its socket and puts tension on the periodontal ligaments. The nerve fibers can then send the information to the central nervous system for interpretation.|$|E

40|$|Bundle sheath chloroplasts {{of maize}} leaves contain about one-fourth as much light-harvesting {{chlorophyll}} a/b binding protein of photosystem II (LHCP-II) as do mesophyll chloroplasts. We {{have determined that}} this difference is, in part, the result of differential expression of different LHCP-II genes.

40|$|The {{electronic}} {{states in}} isolated single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) {{have been considered}} as an ideal realization of a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL). However, it remains unclear whether one-dimensional correlated states are realized under local environmental effects such as {{the formation of a}} bundle structure. Intertube effects originating from other adjacent SWCNTs within a bundle may drastically alter the one-dimensional correlated state. In order to test the validity of the TLL model <b>in</b> <b>bundled</b> SWCNTs, low-energy spin excitation is investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The NMR relaxation rate <b>in</b> <b>bundled</b> mixtures of metallic and semiconducting SWCNTs shows a power-law temperature dependence with a theoretically predicted exponent. This demonstrates that a TLL state with the same strength as that for effective Coulomb interactions is realized <b>in</b> a <b>bundled</b> sample, as <b>in</b> isolated SWCNTs. <b>In</b> <b>bundled</b> metallic SWCNTs, we found a power-law temperature dependence of the relaxation rate, but the magnitude of the relaxation rate is one order of magnitude smaller than that predicted by theory. Furthermore, we found an almost doubled magnitude of the Luttinger parameter. These results indicate suppressed spin excitations with reduced Coulomb interactions <b>in</b> <b>bundled</b> metallic SWCNTs, which are attributable to intertube interactions originating from adjacent metallic SWCNTs within a bundle. Our findings give direct evidence that bundling reduces the effective Coulomb interactions via intertube interactions within bundled metallic SWCNTs. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
