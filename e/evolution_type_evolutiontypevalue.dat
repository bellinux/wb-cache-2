40|$|Abstract—The {{determination}} of <b>evolution</b> <b>type</b> {{plays an important}} role in securing the accurate and efficient evolution of service composition. Based on the applied level in the evolution of service composition, using open-bisimulation theory, <b>evolution</b> <b>type</b> can be decided from three dimensions, which are respectively single state node, single service and service composition, and the determination rule as well. The {{determination of}} <b>evolution</b> <b>type</b> for single state node can tell whether the external behaviors of the node has changed, while the single service can confirm the changes that the state nodes of the service have had in quantity and logic during the business process, and the <b>evolution</b> <b>type</b> of service composition can provide guidance for fixing the final evolution program. Finally, a case study of how to decide the <b>evolution</b> <b>type</b> of web service composition is offered to demonstrate the practical application of the above rules.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{analyses}} {{friction coefficient}} evolution of dry lubricant coatings subjected to unidirectional sliding. Dry lubricant coatings {{have been investigated}} for maintaining low friction under sliding conditions, and {{have been used for}} this purpose in mechanical components. Experimental characterisation of coating durability can be achieved by measuring the friction coefficient {{as a function of the}} number of turns, or, alternatively, the sliding distance. In this paper, literature on abrasive wear tests of various low friction coatings was reviewed, and friction coefficient evolutions of these coatings were analysed with appropriate mathematical forms. The friction coefficient evolutions can be classified into three distinct types: exponential, linear, and logarithmic. In an exponential <b>evolution</b> <b>type,</b> friction coefficient growth rate with respect to sliding distance is expressed as a power-law function of the friction coefficient itself. It was identified that two parameters determine the friction coefficient evolution: the damage rate constant and the damage exponent. The damage exponent was found to be close to unity, suggesting an exponential relation between damage and sliding distance. In a linear <b>evolution</b> <b>type,</b> friction coefficient growth rate is constant, expressed with the damage rate constant. In a logarithmic <b>evolution</b> <b>type,</b> friction coefficient growth rate is expressed as a power-law function of sliding distance. Two parameters, the damage rate constant and the damage exponent, were also identified. The damage exponent was found to be close to minus unity. This characterisation of friction coefficient evolutions with the damage rate constant and the damage exponent helps to understand friction behaviours of coated systems...|$|R

For intermediate-mass and heavy elements, these are stellar <b>evolution,</b> <b>type</b> Ia and core collapse supernovae as well as hypernovae. We discuss successes and failures of existing processes and possible solutions via new (hitherto unknown) processes. Finally an analysis of their role is given in the puzzle to explain the evolution of the elemental and isotopic compositions found in galaxies, and especially the mixture found in the solar system. Different timescales due to the progenitor mass dependence of the endpoints of stellar <b>evolution</b> (<b>type</b> II supernova explosions — SNe II vs. planetary nebulae) or single vs. binary stellar systems (the latter being responsible for novae, type Ia supernovae — SNe Ia, or X-ray bursts) are the keys to understand galactic evolution.

The LTI SDE is time-discretized analytically, resulting in a state space model with linear-Gaussian dynamics. We use expectation propagation to perform approximate inference on non-Gaussian data, and show how to incorporate sparse approximations to further reduce the computational complexity.
