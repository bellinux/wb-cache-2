5|$|As Julio made landfall, it {{produced}} lightning and locally heavy rainfall, which left {{more than a}} dozen communities isolated due to flooding. The flooding damaged several houses and killed two people. Winds were generally light, although strong enough to damage a few electrical poles and small buildings. In nearby Sinaloa, rainfall from the storm led to an <b>emergency</b> <b>evacuation</b> of 500 residents.|$|E

The structure was shot-blasted to remove old paint and rust, allowing repairs to be undertaken before repainting. A lift for visitors to ascend to the jib and an <b>emergency</b> <b>evacuation</b> stair were installed, along with a wire mesh around the viewing area and floodlights to illuminate the crane at night.|$|E
5|$|A {{hyperbaric}} lifeboat or hyperbaric {{rescue unit}} may {{be provided for}} <b>emergency</b> <b>evacuation</b> of saturation divers from a saturation system. This would be used if the platform is at immediate risk due to fire or sinking, and allows the divers under saturation to get clear of the immediate danger. A hyperbaric lifeboat may be self-propelled and can be operated by crew while the while the occupants are under pressure. It must be self-sufficient for several days at sea, {{in case of a}} delay in rescue due to sea conditions. The crew would normally start decompression as soon as possible after launching.|$|E
5|$|The Three Mile Island {{power station}} is near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania in the United States. The {{accident}} described in Three Mile Island began on Wednesday, March 28, 1979, and ultimately {{resulted in a}} partial core meltdown in Unit 2 of the nuclear power plant. Unit 2's pressurized water reactor was of 900 MWe capacity. The scope and complexity of this reactor accident became clear {{over the course of}} five days, as a number of agencies at the local, state and federal levels tried to solve the problem and decide whether the ongoing accident required an <b>emergency</b> <b>evacuation,</b> and to what extent.|$|E

5|$|At the low altitudes {{at which}} Mir orbited {{there is a}} variety of space debris, {{consisting}} of everything from entire spent rocket stages and defunct satellites, to explosion fragments, paint flakes, slag from solid rocket motors, coolant released by RORSAT nuclear powered satellites, small needles, and many other objects. These objects, in addition to natural micrometeoroids, posed {{a threat to the}} station as they could puncture pressurised modules and cause damage {{to other parts of the}} station, such as the solar arrays. Micrometeoroids also posed a risk to spacewalking cosmonauts, as such objects could puncture their spacesuits, causing them to depressurise. Meteor showers in particular posed a risk, and, during such storms, the crews slept in their Soyuz ferries to facilitate an <b>emergency</b> <b>evacuation</b> should Mir be damaged.|$|E
5|$|The {{unusually large}} wind field uprooted many {{thousands}} of trees, downed many power lines, damaged hundreds of houses, and snapped thousands of telephone poles and cross arms. Hundreds of roads, including major highways, were blocked by fallen trees. An <b>emergency</b> <b>evacuation</b> shelter in Newport News reported minor wind damage. Two {{people in the region}} died due to falling trees—one in New Kent County and one in the city of Hopewell. Power outages left most traffic lights not working across Hampton Roads, resulting in multiple minor car accidents. Additionally, most gas stations were closed, due to power outages leaving the pumps unusable. Old Dominion University remained closed for two weeks due to storm damage and power issues, the longest it has ever been closed during a school term. Likewise, Norfolk State University, Regent University, Tidewater Community College and Eastern Virginia Medical School all experienced significant closing times due to both storm damage and a lack of electricity.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, he {{was picked}} by New York Governor Mario Cuomo to chair a {{scientific}} fact-finding commission on the Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant, a job that required him {{to find common ground}} between the many viewpoints represented on the commission. The commission eventually recommended the closure of the plant, a course he personally disagreed with. Cuomo had formed the commission in mid-May 1983 to provide him with recommendations regarding the plant's safety, the adequacy of emergency plans, and the economics of operating the plant. The commission's consensus recommendations included unanimous findings that no <b>emergency</b> <b>evacuation</b> of the plant could be conducted without the cooperation of Suffolk County, which was refusing to approve an evacuation plan; that the construction of the plant would have been prevented if it had been started after new Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations were put into effect after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979; and that operating the plant would not reduce utility costs. Marburger himself at the time emphasized that the governor had not been seeking a consensus but rather encouraged multiple viewpoints to be reflected, and characterized the consensus conclusions as not the only important section of the report.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the Bynars discreetly {{create a}} catastrophic {{failure in the}} ship's warp core. Lt. Cmdr. Data (Brent Spiner) and Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) are unable to locate Picard or Riker and, {{assuming}} them to already be on the Starbase, order an <b>emergency</b> <b>evacuation.</b> They set the ship to leave the Starbase and warp to a safe location before it would explode. However, once they are clear of the dock, the failure disappears and the ship sets course for the Bynar system, the planet Bynaus orbiting Beta Magellan. Data, La Forge, and Quinteros realize that the Bynars are still aboard the ship, but there are currently no other working vessels to follow them. Back on the Enterprise, Riker and Picard leave the simulation to find the ship empty and at warp to the Bynar system, with the ship's controls locked to the bridge. Fearing that the Bynars have taken over the ship for nefarious purposes, they set the ship to self-destruct in 5 minutes and then take the bridge by inter-ship transporter beam and find the Bynars there unconscious.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{potential}} impacts from Helene, the Weather Bureau began to advise prompt <b>emergency</b> <b>evacuation</b> in their advisories. Areas between Beaufort, South Carolina and Cape Fear, North Carolina were urged to begin evacuation procedures immediately. The Southeastern American Red Cross sent ten field staff warnings to locations in Georgia and South Carolina in order to assist in setting up emergency shelters. The Red Cross held 27hurricane preparation conferences to plan preparation procedures. Other civil defense organizations also mobilized hurricane preparation staff and equipment. The Weather Bureau sent a mobile weather station to Charleston, South Carolina in order to monitor weather conditions and alert surrounding populations with short-range radio equipment. Beaches on North Carolina's coast, including Wrightsville Beach and Carolina Beach, were completely evacuated during the night of September27. In Wilmington, North Carolina, 100members of the United States National Guard were dispatched to monitor waterfront property, while 60others were kept on standby. Civilian vehicles attempting to enter Myrtle Beach, South Carolina were sent back by highway patrol 15mi (25km) outside the city borders, following an order issued by Governor of South Carolina George Bell Timmerman, Jr. The order was issued to minimize casualties and prevent looting. Approximately 100members of the National Guard and local police were kept to patrol the beach. Despite repeated orders for mandatory evacuation, a few people remained in Myrtle Beach. Civil Defense authorities forcibly evacuated stragglers, but others were permitted to remain.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{enters the}} cave and is locked in. He escapes through another exit, and discovers a place used by Brian to escape his father. Henry goes deeper into the cave with the {{climbing}} equipment left at Brian's camp, and discovers Brian's corpse {{at the bottom of}} a cavern, piled under rocks. Delilah is upset, blaming herself for allowing Brian to stay. The next day, a conflagration grows uncontrollably and an <b>emergency</b> <b>evacuation</b> order is given out to all lookouts. As Henry prepares, he follows the tracking device's signal to a cassette tape from Ned, who claims that Brian's death was because of climbing inexperience. Unwilling to return to society, Ned admits to living in the wilderness and is trekking deeper, advising against following him. Henry finds Ned's camp with items from the watchtowers, camp and the teenage girls, whom Delilah confirms are safe and sound. The government camp was studying wildlife, with Ned using radio equipment to deter Henry. Delilah states that a rescue helicopter is waiting for him at Thorofare Lookout and he treks there to find Delilah gone, having taken another helicopter. Using the radio equipment, he contacts her one final time and asks when he will see her again. She tells him to go back to his wife and Henry boards a helicopter heading home.|$|E
40|$|Vehicular {{evacuation}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} and often preferred protective action options available for emergency management in a real or anticipated disaster. Computer simulation models of evacuation traffic flow are used to estimate the time required for the affected populations to evacuate to safer areas, to evaluate effectiveness of vehicular evacuations as a protective action option. and to develop comprehensive evacuation plans when required. Following a review of the past efforts to simulate traffic flow during <b>emergency</b> <b>evacuations,</b> an overview of the key features in Version 2. 0 of the Oak Ridge Evacuation Modeling System (OREMS) are presented in this paper.
