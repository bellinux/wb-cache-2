40|$|Abstract. It is very {{important}} for gas-membrane interaction between compressible ideal gas and elastic membrane structure of space <b>folded</b> <b>tubes</b> during inflation deployment. This paper analyses gas flow field of the <b>folded</b> <b>tube</b> by the finite volume method, and simulates inflation process of the membrane tube with different height of the baffle. A finite volume model of gas flow field is established in the <b>folded</b> membrane <b>tube,</b> and variations of the pressure inside the membrane tube are obtained with height of the baffle and inlet flow rate. And then, the gas-membrane interaction is calculated by couple the CFD and CSD solver. The results show that the pressure on the membrane wall increases with the inflation velocity, and inlet velocity of inflation gives rise to the vibration of the membrane...|$|R
40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. The {{performance}} of large-capacity single-stage pulse-tube coolers at temperatures below 70 K is often hampered by Rayleigh streaming, or the natural boundary-layer convection {{that occurs in}} the <b>buffer</b> <b>tube</b> (‘pulse tube’). In Olson and Swift’s landmark 1997 paper 1, they explained how a slight taper in the <b>buffer</b> <b>tube</b> could suppress this streaming. They also showed how the streaming could be suppressed by the proper phasing of pressure vs. flow in the <b>buffer</b> <b>tube,</b> which is enforced by the proper choice of phase-shift mechanism (i. e. length and diameter of inertance tube, etc.). This is the approach usually taken because a straight <b>buffer</b> <b>tube</b> is simpler, especially when considering a coaxial construction (where a tapered <b>buffer</b> <b>tube</b> would imply a tapered regenerator). In addition, the phasing which suppresses Rayleigh streaming coincides with efficient cycle phasing for many applications. At temperatures below 70 K, however, this is less true, and for a 50 K machine a significant benefit may be realized by decoupling the streaming suppression from the cycle phasing. At the same time, {{we have found that}} coaxial coldheads can successfully use nonconductive <b>buffer</b> <b>tubes,</b> if the material with the right thermal expansion coefficient is selected. This enables the use of a tapered <b>buffer</b> <b>tube</b> in a coax design, as the material can be thick enough to have a constant outside diameter (OD) and a tapered inside diameter (ID). This paper will discuss the results obtained on a high-capacity cooler using a tapered <b>buffer</b> <b>tube</b> and includes some measurements showing the importance of having the right taper angle...|$|R

30|$|This {{mechanism}} can {{be applied}} to self-assembly of polyhedral structures with discontinuous thick films as well as curved self-assembly structures such as curvature with continuous thin films under Sn grains (Fig.  1 j–l). As shown in Fig.  6 a–c, the strategy mentioned in this paper can be directly applied to self-assembly of tube structures. After figuring out the power of 150  W, the gas flow rate ratio was optimized to achieve the successful self-assembly process. The zoom in images of the insets of Fig.  6 c are shown in Fig.  6 d–f, corresponding to ④, ⑤, and ⑥. At the O 2 /CF 4 ratio of 0.5, the vertical to horizontal etching rate ratio is 1, which cannot accumulate enough energy to self-assembly of the tube before releasing it form the substrate, resulting in ununiformed partially <b>folded</b> <b>tube</b> structure (Fig.  6 c, d). By slight increasing the O 2 to CF 4 gas flow rate ratio, the vertical to horizontal etching rate ratio can be increased to 1.2, which can generate more energy for folding the structures before releasing, resulting in totally <b>folded</b> <b>tube</b> structure (Fig.  6 c, e). Similar to the trend of cubic structures, further increase in the O 2 to CF 4 flow rate ratio will lead to higher vertical to horizontal etch rate ratio (1.8), which make the Sn melted and flowed away from surface before the structure can be folded, leading to the failure of self-assembly (Fig.  6 c, f).|$|R

By the time tandem-wing aerodynamic characteristics are researched much less than ones of traditional scheme.

Geometries with negative and zero differences of forward and rear wings inclination angles were considered (in last case with stall-strips on forward wing and with different airfoils of forward and rear wing). It was shown that for negative difference of inclination angles tandem-scheme can be exploited for wide range of centering and can be optimized for cruise flight (without balancing loss) while stability maintenance at high angle of attack. For zero difference of inclination angles UAV with stall-strips or with different airfoils of forward and rear wing also can be longitudinally stable in wide range of angle of attack, but is attributed by significant balancing losses. For eliminating of this effect airfoils with positive can be used, but they have lower maximal lift-drag ratio. ? ?????? ?????????-???????? ??????? ????????? ????????? ????????????????? ???????? ? ?????????? ???????????? ?????????? ???? ????? ???????? ? ????????????? ? ??????? ?????? ?????????? ? ? ????????? ?????? ? ????????? ?? ???????? ?????, ? ????? ? ??????? ????????? ?? ???????? ? ?????? ???????. ????????, ??? ??? ????????????? ???? ?????????? ????? ????? ?????????????? ? ??????? ????????? ????????? ? ???? ???????????????? ??? ???????????? ?????? ??????

40|$|Abstract. The {{subject of}} this paper are {{experimental}} researches and numerical simulations of combined collision energy absorber.

The idea was to use process of shrinking and <b>folding</b> <b>tubes</b> in a parallel mode to absorb as much collision kinetic energy as possible by controlled deformation, with limited dimensions of absorber. Energy absorption was achieved by elastic-plastic deformations of the tubes and friction between the tube and the cone bush. Using combined method, during the collision, energy absorption starts in the tube which is compressed into cone bush. After pre-defined stroke in the process of energy absorption the simultaneous process of folding of the outer tube starts, so both tubes deform in parallel mode {{during the rest of the}} stroke. In this way the force gradually increases without undesirable peaks during the entire stroke, resulting significant bigger amount of absorbed energy. Experimental investigations of combined absorber were realized in laboratory conditions. During experimental investigations the stroke and force were measured...|$|R
