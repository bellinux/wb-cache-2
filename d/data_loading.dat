25|$|An {{important}} force encouraging complexity {{was very}} limited main memories (on {{the order of}} kilobytes). It was therefore advantageous for the code density—the density of information held in computer programs—to be high, leading to features such as highly encoded, variable length instructions, doing <b>data</b> <b>loading</b> as well as calculation (as mentioned above). These issues were of higher priority than the ease of decoding such instructions.|$|E
500|$|The game also {{received}} criticisms from the media. Several reviewers {{noted that there}} were difficulties experienced with the interface, requiring a certain learning curve to get used to, and selected camera angles for some puzzles were poorly chosen. The use of elevators in the game was particularly noted as troublesome. The review from Adventure Gamers expressed dislike of the soundtrack, and, at times, [...] "found it too heavy and not well suited to the game's theme". A Computer and Video Games review {{also noted that the}} game had continuous and long <b>data</b> <b>loading</b> from the CD-ROM that interrupted the game and [...] "spoils the fluidity of some sequences and causes niggling delays".|$|E
40|$|When {{the number}} of cues {{provided}} to a banker for a decision is increased it may (1) increase their information load (number of relevant cues), (2) increase their <b>data</b> <b>load</b> (number of irrelevant cues), and (3) reduce their uncertainty. Models, on the other hand, are not affected by information or <b>data</b> <b>load.</b> The results from this research show that as {{the number of}} cues provided to bankers increases, uncertainty reduces, <b>data</b> <b>load</b> increases, but information load is unaffected. The uncertainty reduction increases the decision accuracy of both the bankers and models. Due to the <b>data</b> <b>load</b> experienced by the bankers but not the models, the models have superior performance. The implications for future practice and research are discussed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} macro <b>data</b> <b>load,</b> an efficient mechanism to enhance loaded value reuse. A macro <b>data</b> <b>load</b> brings into the processor a maximum-width data value the cache port allows, saves it in an internal structure, and facilitates reuse by later loads. A comprehensive limit study using a generalized memory value reuse table (MVRT) shows the significantly increased reuse opportunities provided by macro <b>data</b> <b>load.</b> We also describe a modified load store queue design as an implementation of the proposed concept. Our quantitative study shows that over 35 % of L 1 cache accesses in the SPEC 2 k integer and MiBench programs can be eliminated, resulting in a related energy reduction of 24 % and 35 % on average, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Intelligent {{transport}} systems aim at improving road safety and traffic efficiency. To achieve this objective, vehicles must {{communicate with each}} other and the environment. One challenge of this communication is scalability. With increasing size of the road system, the <b>data</b> <b>load</b> eventually congests the network channel. This challenge can be solved by reducing the <b>data</b> <b>load</b> through <b>data</b> aggregation. This work introduces an aggregation framework to design aggregation schemes that adaptively adjust the <b>data</b> <b>load</b> if needed. A highly flexible tree-based data structure that allows adaptive data aggregation is introduced as part of this framework. Three different aggregation schemes developed with the framework are discussed in this thesis. Evaluations showed the individual advantages and disadvantages of each approach and suggests that adaptive data aggregation improves the data quality significantly...|$|R
