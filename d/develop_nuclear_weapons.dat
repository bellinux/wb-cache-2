5|$|Tube Alloys was a codename of the clandestine {{research}} and development programme, authorised by the United Kingdom, with participation from Canada, to <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> during the Second World War. Starting before the Manhattan Project in the United States, the British efforts were kept classified and as such had {{to be referred to}} by code even within the highest circles of government.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932, followed by that of nuclear fission in uranium by the German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, and its theoretical explanation (and naming) by Lise Meitner and Otto Robert Frisch soon after, opened up {{the possibility of a}} nuclear chain reaction with uranium. Fears that a German atomic bomb project would <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons,</b> especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries, were expressed in the Einstein-Szilard letter. This prompted preliminary research in the United States in late 1939.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1986 U.S. attack, the army was purged of perceived disloyal elements, and in 1988, Gaddafi announced the creation of a popular militia to replace the army and police. In 1987, Libya began production of mustard gas at a facility in Rabta, although publicly denying it was stockpiling chemical weapons, and unsuccessfully attempted to <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> The period also saw a growth in domestic Islamist opposition, formulated into groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. A number of assassination attempts against Gaddafi were foiled, and in turn, 1989 saw the security forces raid mosques believed to be centres of counter-revolutionary preaching. In October 1993, elements of the increasingly marginalized army initiated a failed coup in Misrata, while in September 1995, Islamists launched an insurgency in Benghazi, and in July 1996 an anti-Gaddafist football riot broke out in Tripoli. The Revolutionary Committees experienced a resurgence to combat these Islamists.|$|E

50|$|North Korea {{denounced the}} {{abrogation}} of paragraph 13(d) {{as an attempt}} to wreck the armistice agreement and turn Korea into a U.S. atomic warfare zone. It responded by digging massive underground fortifications resistant to nuclear attack, and forward deployment of its conventional forces so that the use of <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> against it would endanger South Korean and U.S. forces as well. In 1963, North Korea asked the Soviet Union for help in <b>developing</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons,</b> but was refused. China later, after its nuclear tests, similarly rejected North Korean requests for help with <b>developing</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b>|$|R
25|$|The U.S. is advocating that Iran and North Korea {{should not}} <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons,</b> while the U.S., {{the only country}} to have used nuclear weapons in warfare, {{maintains}} a nuclear arsenal of 5,113 warheads. However, this double-standard is legitimated by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), to which Iran is a party.|$|E
25|$|By October 1952, the United Kingdom {{had become}} the third country—after the United States and the Soviet Union—to {{independently}} test and <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> This gave Britain the capability to launch a nuclear strike via its Vulcan bomber force and they began developing a ballistic missile program known as Blue Streak.|$|E
25|$|Zel'dovich {{developed}} a scientific report with Isaak Gurevich, Isaak Pomeranchuk, and Khariton on {{the feasibility of}} releasing energy through nuclear fusion triggered by an atomic explosion and presented it to Igor Kurchatov.

25|$|In {{other books}} and columns for {{conservative}} {{websites such as}} WorldNetDaily and Human Events, Corsi has discussed topics that are considered conspiracy theories, such as the alleged plans for a North American Government, the theory that President Barack Obama is not an American citizen, criticism of the United States government for allegedly covering up information about {{the terrorist attacks of}} September 11, 2001, and alleged United States support of Iran in its attempts to <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b>|$|E
25|$|The UK {{has a large}} {{variety of}} {{different}} intermediate- and high-level radioactive wastes, coming from national programmes to <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> and nuclear power. It is a national responsibility {{to pay for the}} management of these. In addition, new nuclear power stations could be built, the waste management from which would be the private sector's financial responsibility, although all would be stored in a single facility. Most of the UK's higher-activity radioactive waste is currently held in temporary storage at Sellafield.|$|E
25|$|Iran {{consistently}} {{claimed that}} {{its nuclear program}} is purely for civilian purposes, {{and that it has}} no intention of ever utilizing its peaceful nuclear program to <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> During the course of Iran's recent history, specifically during the Iran-Iraq war, Iran has experienced significant outages of its commercial electricity grid. Iran has also continuously claimed that it intends to ultimately export part of the electricity produced by its nuclear reactors to its regional neighbors, as a way of diversifying its mainly oil-based economy to more diversified revenue streams.|$|E

25|$|Iran {{has had a}} {{civilian}} nuclear program since before the 1979 revolution. However, since the revolution, {{there has been some}} worries that Iran could use this program to <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> These worries have been raised by the revelation, on August 2002, by Alireza Jafarzadeh, a prominent associate of MKO, of the existence of two secret nuclear sites: a uranium enrichment facility in Natanz (part of which is underground), and a heavy water facility in Arak. There is however no proof at this stage that this program is not purely civilian.|$|E
25|$|The United States was not {{particularly}} {{in favor of a}} nuclear Sweden. The cooperation agreement between Sweden and the United States, that established bilateral safeguards for Swedish nuclear installations, forbade Sweden from using equipment and materials to <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> In the meantime, the use of U.S. uranium would mean accepting inspection requirements, which would prevent the uranium in question from being used for weapons production. The more Sweden’s research in nuclear weapons was becoming dependent on U.S. military assistance, the more the United States was willing to steer Sweden away from implementing its plans to create a nuclear weapon.|$|E
25|$|Since King Abdullah's {{visit to}} Beijing in January 2006, Saudi-Chinese {{relations}} have focused predominantly {{on energy and}} trade. The king's visit was the first by a Saudi head of state to China since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1990. Bilateral trade with China has more than tripled, and China would soon be Saudi Arabia's largest importer. Saudi Arabia also committed significant investments in China, including the $8 billion Fujian refinery. Based on a WikiLeaks cable, the King told the Chinese that it was willing to effectively trade a guaranteed oil supply in return for Chinese pressure on Iran not to <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{interpreted}} that these criteria encompass the scenario of Taiwan <b>developing</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> (see main article Taiwan and {{weapons of mass destruction}} also Timeline of the Republic of China's nuclear program).|$|R
25|$|The {{situation}} could have potentially {{lead to a}} war between a de facto <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> state (India—who had already conducted a nuclear test in 1974 codename Smiling Buddha) and a state, although nuclear power, {{was believed to be}} <b>developing</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> at that time (Pakistan).|$|R
50|$|South Africa is {{the only}} country that <b>developed</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> by itself and later {{dismantled}} them - unlike the former Soviet states Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, which inherited <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> from the former USSR and also acceded to the NPT as non-nuclear weapon states.|$|R
25|$|It {{may seem}} {{paradoxical}} that the Air Force changed opinion {{on nuclear weapons}} given {{the expansion of the}} relative importance of the US Air Force following America's adoption of nuclear weapons. At the time, however, the Air Force was facing an expensive acquisition of the Saab 37 Viggen, and feared that a full-scale nuclear weapons program would compete with it for resources. One of the points that Norén wanted to investigate was what conventional forces Sweden could acquire if it decided not to <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> It should be noted that it was the plan that the United States suggested Sweden to follow in 1960. However, it remains unclear whether or not this suggestion influenced Sweden’s defense officials.|$|E
25|$|China's {{repeated}} {{threats to}} intervene in the conflict in support of Pakistan increased pressure on the government to take an immediate decision to <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> Despite repeated assurances, the United States did little to prevent extensive use of American arms by Pakistani forces during the conflict, thus irking India. At the same time, the United States and United Kingdom refused to supply India with sophisticated weaponry which further strained the relations between the West and India. These developments led to a significant change in India's foreign policy– India, which had previously championed the cause of non-alignment, distanced itself further from Western powers and developed close relations with the Soviet Union. By the end of the 1960s, the Soviet Union emerged as the biggest supplier of military hardware to India. From 1967 to 1977, 81% of India's arms imports were from the Soviet Union. After the 1965 war, the arms race between India and Pakistan became even more asymmetric and India was outdistancing Pakistan by far.|$|E
25|$|In August 1939, Leo Szilard and Albert Einstein {{sent the}} Einstein–Szilárd letter to Roosevelt, {{warning of the}} {{possibility}} of a German project to <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> Szilard realized that the recently discovered process of nuclear fission could be used to create a nuclear chain reaction that {{could be used as a}} weapon of mass destruction. Roosevelt feared the consequences of allowing Germany to have sole possession of the technology, and authorized preliminary research into nuclear weapons. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Roosevelt administration secured the funds needed to continue research and selected General Leslie Groves to oversee the Manhattan Project, which was charged with developing the first nuclear weapons. Roosevelt and Churchill agreed to jointly pursue the project, and Roosevelt helped ensure that American scientists cooperated with their British counterparts. In August 1945, the United States would drop nuclear weapons on two major Japanese cities, and Japan would surrender to the Allies in September 1945.|$|E
50|$|Jafarzadeh is {{also the}} author of a 304-paged book (The Iran Threat: President Ahmadinejad and the Coming Nuclear Crisis) about Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the former President of Iran, and his alleged {{interest}} in <b>developing</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1976, Vanunu {{applied for}} {{a job at the}} Negev Nuclear Research Center, an Israeli {{facility}} used to <b>develop</b> and manufacture <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> located in the Negev Desert south of Dimona. Most worldwide intelligence agencies estimate that Israel <b>developed</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> as early as the 1960s, but the country has intentionally maintained a [...] "nuclear ambiguity", neither acknowledging nor denying that it possesses <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> Vanunu was responding to an advertisement for trainee technicians to work at the facility.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, a U.S. poll {{conducted}} Sep. 30 to Oct. 1 by the Pew Research Center, found 61% agreed {{it was more}} important to prevent Iran from <b>developing</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons,</b> even if it means taking military action.|$|R
