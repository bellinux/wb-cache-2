Moreover, the removal efficiencies by EC were 42, 44, and 40 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, the removal efficiencies of TDS in first, second, and third samples by second freezing process observed 69, 69, and 68 percent, respectively.

50|$|Most liquids <b>freeze</b> by <b>crystallization,</b> {{formation}} of crystalline solid from the uniform liquid. This is a first-order thermodynamic phase transition, which means that, {{as long as}} solid and liquid coexist, {{the temperature of the}} whole system remains very nearly equal to the melting point due to slow removal of heat when in contact with air, which is a poor heat conductor. Because of the latent heat of fusion, the freezing is greatly slowed down and the temperature will not drop anymore once the freezing starts but will continue dropping once it finishes. Crystallization consists of two major events, nucleation and crystal growth. Nucleation is the step wherein the molecules start to gather into clusters, on the nanometer scale, arranging in a defined and periodic manner that defines the crystal structure. The crystal growth is the subsequent growth of the nuclei that succeed in achieving the critical cluster size.|$|R
50|$|The glass {{transition}} of a liquid to a solid-like state may occur with either cooling or compression. The transition comprises a smooth {{increase in the}} viscosity of a material {{by as much as}} 17 orders of magnitude within a temperature range of 500 K without any pronounced change in material structure. The consequence of this dramatic increase is a glass exhibiting solid-like mechanical properties on the timescale of practical observation. This transition is in contrast to the <b>freezing</b> or <b>crystallization</b> transition, which is a first-order phase transition in the Ehrenfest classification and involves discontinuities in thermodynamic and dynamic properties such as volume, energy, and viscosity. In many materials that normally undergo a freezing transition, rapid cooling will avoid this phase transition and instead result in a {{glass transition}} at some lower temperature. Other materials, such as many polymers, lack a well defined crystalline state and easily form glasses, even upon very slow cooling or compression. The tendency for a material to form a glass while quenched is called glass forming ability. This ability depends on the composition of the material and can be predicted by the rigidity theory.|$|R

The distillation process due to neon-crystallization is found to occur only for the late stages of crystallization.

The final phase diagram is found to exhibit an azeotropic point with a neon concentration x_Ne= 0. 22, a carbon concentration x_C= 0. 78 and an oxygen concentration x_O= 0, so that during the distillation process, the fluid crystallizes into a pure neon-carbon solid. The critical temperature is T_A= 0. 85 T_C, where T_C is the pure carbon crystallization temperature.

These measurements indicate that formation of gels of complex hierarchical structure arises from occurrence of different elementary processes, involving different length and time scales. The fastest process {{that could be}} detected by our measurements during the first cryotropic treatment consists of the crystallization of the solvent.

If it is cooled extremely rapidly, liquid water turns into amorphous ice, also called vitreous water, a glassy and amorphous solid. For cryo-preservation, the vitrification of cells is believed to be mandatory for cell survival after <b>freezing.</b> Intracellular ice <b>crystallization</b> is assumed to be lethal, but experimental data on the state of water during cryopreservation are lacking. To better understand the water conditions in cells subjected to freezing protocols, we chose to directly analyze their subcellular water states by cryo-electron microscopy and tomography, cryoelectron diffraction, and x-ray diffraction both in the cryofixed state and after warming to different temperatures. By correlating the survival rates of cells with their respective water states during cryopreservation, we found that survival is less dependent on ice-crystal formation than expected. Using high-resolution cryo-imaging, we were able to directly show that cells tolerate crystallization of extra- and intracellular water. However, if warming is too slow, many small ice crystals will recrystallize into fewer but bigger crystals, which is lethal. The applied cryoprotective agents determine which crystal size is tolerable.

40|$|If Mars ever {{possessed a}} salty liquid hydrosphere, which later partly {{evaporated}} and froze down, then any aqueous fluids left {{near the surface}} could have evolved to become dense eutectic brines. Eutectic brines, by definition, are the last to freeze {{and the first to}} melt. If CaC 12 -rich, such brines can remain liquid until temperatures below 220 K, close to the average surface temperature of Mars. In the Martian subsurface, in intimate contact with the Ca-rich basaltic regolith, NaC 1 -rich early brines should have reacted to become Ca-rich. Fractional <b>crystallization</b> (<b>freezing)</b> and partial melting would also drive brines toward CaC 12 -rich compositions. In other words, eutectic brine compositions could be present in the shallow subsurface of Mars, for the same reasons that eutectic magma compositions are common on Earth. Don Juan Pond, Antarctica, a CaC 12 -rich eutectic brine, provides a possible terrestrial analog, particularly because it is fed from a basaltic aquifer. Owing to their relative density and fluid nature, brines in the Martian regolith should eventually become sandwiched between ice above and salts beneath. A thawing brine sandwich provides one explanation (among many) for the young gullies recently attributed to seepage of liquid water on Mars.

40|$|A {{catalyst}} {{is defined}} as a substance that accelerates a process without undergoing a net change due to that process. Most chemistry students learn about catalysts in the context of chemical reactions, such as the enzymes in biochemistry or the heterogeneous metal catalysts in inorganic chemistry (1, 2). However, it is both important and instructive to show students that the concept of catalysis is broader than molecular chemistry as it also includes physical processes such as <b>crystallization,</b> <b>freezing,</b> boiling, and liquid condensation. Students are familiar with measures to accelerate these processes but probably without realizing that they apply a catalyst, according to the definition given above. In basic laboratorywork, for example, students learn about the precautions to prevent “bumping” when heating solutions or distilling liquids. This bumping is the sudden boiling that results in hot liquid and vapor shooting uncontrollably out of the heating vessel. Addition of boiling stones to the liquid before heating will prevent this uncontrolled boiling; alternative antibumping measures are stirring of the liquid with amechanical stirrer ormagnetic flea or the use of an inert gas (nitrogen) capillary bleed in the case of vacuum distillation (3). The effect of these precautions is that they facilitate the nucleation, that is, the formation of vapor bubbles in the heated liquid, such that the liquid boils at its normal boiling point (for either ambient or reduced pressure). Without antibumping measures the liquid temperature may rise above the liquid's boiling point. Any bubble nucleation in this so-called superheated liquid will lead to the uncontrollable boiling mentioned above.

40|$|<b>Freeze</b> <b>crystallization</b> is a {{particular}} type of a purification method where the solvent freezes out, which constricts the volume of the solution, leaving thus behind a more concentrated solution. In the case of freezing an aqueous solution, water is the solvent which crystallizes and can be separated from the concentrated solution by the virtue of buoyancy. In an ideal situation, <b>freeze</b> <b>crystallization</b> of an aqueous solution produces ice crystals that do not contain any of the impurities present in the original solution. As the process continues, the original solution becomes more concentrated and the freezing temperature declines progressively. Freezing point depression (FPD) is of vital importance in characterising the freezing behaviour of any solution. Due to this necessity, a new calculation method to predict FPD is presented in this work. In this method, designated ion-interaction parameters for the Pitzer model are extracted from reliable FPD data found in the literature, other than calorimetric data. The extracted parameters from FPD data are capable of predicting the freezing point more accurately than those resulted from the calorimetric data. The calculation method is exemplified for numerous 1 - 1 and 1 - 2 types of electrolytes. Impurities in excess of the maximum recommended limits must be removed from wastewater prior to discharge because of their persistent bio-accumulative and detrimental nature. Natural freezing is suggested in the present work as a purification technique to treat huge volumes of wastewater in a sustainable and energy-efficient manner. The efficiency of <b>freeze</b> <b>crystallization</b> in the purification of wastewater by imitating natural freezing in a developed winter simulation with the provision of altering winter conditions is scrutinized in this thesis. Hence, natural freezing is simulated experimentally for ice crystallization from unsaturated aqueous Na 2 SO 4 and NiSO 4 solutions to assess the feasibility of such a technique to be used to purify wastewaters containing electrolytes. This work presents a series of data in similitude of natural freezing of water from aqueous Na 2 SO 4 and NiSO 4 solutions in various concentrations and freezing conditions. The influence of solution concentration and different freezing conditions, such as ambient temperature, freezing time and freezing rate, on the efficiency of the purification process is investigated by analysing the effective distribution coefficient (K) of the solute between ice and the solution. The experimental results demonstrate clearly that high purity ice can be obtained from slow freezing of the solution with the concentration typically found in industrial wastewater. During <b>freeze</b> <b>crystallization,</b> the diffusion of impurities from the solid-liquid interface to the bulk of the solution, along with the growth mechanism of the solid phase {{play an important role in}} determining the purity of the ice layer. Therefore, a calculation method is introduced to estimate the concentration of the solution at the advancing ice–solution interface in terms of the limiting distribution coefficient (K*) from experimental K values at different growth conditions. The heat transfer -controlled growth rate of the ice limited by the free convective heat transfer coefficient of air (hair) rather than the thermal conductivity of the ice (kice) and the heat transfer coefficient of the solution (hsol) was found to prevail over the mass transfer of rejected solute molecules from the ice–solution interface to the bulk solution of experimental interest. A simplified and robust model is developed to estimate the thickness and growth rate of the ice layer formed from solutions at different freezing conditions, and the model is validated with experimental results. In addition, inclusion formation within the ice matrix during freezing is investigated for various solution concentrations, both macroscopically and microscopically...|$|E

These contaminates change {{the characteristics of the}} salt overtime and as a result, large volumes of contaminated salt are being removed, reprocessed and stored as radioactive waste. To reduce the storage volumes and improve recycling process for cost minimization, a salt purification method called zone freezing has been proposed at Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI). Zone <b>freezing</b> is melt <b>crystallization</b> process similar to the vertical Bridgeman method. In this process, the eutectic salt is slowly cooled axially from top to bottom. As solidification occurs, the fission products are rejected from the solid interface and forced into the liquid phase. The resulting product is a grown crystal with the bulk of the fission products {{near the bottom of the}} salt ingot, where they can be easily be sectioned and removed. Despite successful feasibility report from KAERI on this process, there were many unexplored parameters to help understanding and improving its operational routines. Thus, this becomes the main motivation of this proposed study. The majority of this work has been focused on the CsCl-LiCl-KCl ternary salt. CeCl 3 -LiCl-KCl was also investigated to check whether or not this process is feasible for the trivalent species—surrogate for rare-earths and transuranics. For the main part of the work, several parameters were varied, they are: (1) the retort advancement rate— 1. 8, 3. 2, and 5. 0 mm/hr, (2) the crucible lid configurations—lid versus no-lid, (3) the amount or size of mixture— 50 and 400 g, (4) the composition of CsCl in the salt— 1, 3, and 5 wt%, and (5) the temperature differences between the high and low furnace zones— 200 and 300 ?C. During each experiment, the temperatures at selected locations around the crucible were measured and recorded to provide temperature profiles. Following each experiment, samples were collected and elemental analysis was done to determine the composition of iii the salt. Several models—non-mixed, well-mixed, Favier, and hybrid—were explored to describe the zone freezing process. For CsCl-LiCl-KCl system, experimental results indicate that through this process up to 90 % of the used salt can be recycled, effectively reducing waste volume by a factor of ten. The optimal configuration was found to be a 5. 0 mm/hr rate with a lid configuration and a ?T of 200 °C. The larger 400 g mixtures had recycle percentages similar to the 50 g mixtures; however, the throughput per time was greater for the 400 g case. As a result, the 400 g case is recommended. For the CeCl 3 -LiCl-KCl system, the result implies that it is possible to use this process to separate the rare-earth and transuranics chlorides. Different models were applied to only CsCl ternary system. The best fit model was the hybrid model as a result of a solute transport transition from non- mixed to well-mixed throughout the growing process...|$|R

Owing to the relatively high investment cost of the technology, its applicability has been limited until now. This paper investigates the feasibility of a vacuum crystallizer as potential replacement of the scraped surface heat exchanger, which is one of the most cost- and maintenance-intensive items in conventional freeze concentration technology. Different crystallizer configurations and vapour treatment methods were evaluated for the system design. A thermodynamic analysis was performed to predict the phase transition behaviour in the condenser. A hydrodynamic analysis was performed to establish design rules and to determine the operating window.

Starting with the extraction of materials from the environment, through the processes used to convert these materials to useful products, and ending with the return of used and waste materials to the environment, numerous processes are used to separate mixtures into their components. Three projects of the Office of Industrial Programs, Department of Energy illustrate these categories. Moltox is an air separation process based on the oxidation/reduction equilibrium of molten alkali nitrites. <b>Freeze</b> <b>crystallization</b> is being developed for concentrating black liquor in the paper making process.
